Someone else standing in my shoes
Count the hours since he left his boots behind
Still in limbo think I'll stay up late
This infomercial's got me lifting weights for you

I'm sober
Is it over now?
Nights gone i'm still waiting
Another drink could save my life

what's this myth said we'd have good times?
I can't seem, to find, find my impulsive side
Just excuses and the lies
Simple things ain't gonna make me survive
This rock'n'roll thing still gives me life
and it's not gonna change
is it all that strange?

I'm sober
Is it over now?
Nights gone I'm still waiting
Another drink could save my life

Someone else standing in my shoes
Count the hours since he left his boots behind
Still in limbo think I'll stay up late
Lorenzo lamas got me lifting fucking weights for you

Yeah, I'm sober
Is it over now?
Nights gone I'm still waiting
Another drink could save my life
Tonight, yeah yeahah
