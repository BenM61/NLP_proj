[Verse1:]
You're a queen, and you deserve to sit upon a throne,
With me, You'd never be alone!
Cause I'm a king, 2 castles and a kingdoms what I'd bring,
To you, if you dance with me tonite.

[Chorus1:]
Sexy mama, oh sexy mama, girl cut the drama
I know you wanna dance with me
Sexy mama, oh sexy mama, girl cut the drama
Come and take a chance with me tonite

[Verse2:]
Teri, ta meri bas, ik jindari hoye (You and I are meant for each other)
Aakh naal aakh miljawe, ahiyo hi duah hoye (Our eyes meet, that's my prayer)
We tu mere kol aaja, dil di pukar hove (Come close to me, my hearts passion)
We tu sade naal aaja, dil di ayho chah hove. (Come with me, that's my hearts desire)

[Chorus2:]
Sajna ve, oh sajna ve, sajna ve (My love, oh my love, my love)
I know you wanna dance with me
Sajna ve, oh sajna ve, sajna ve (My love, oh my love, my love)
Come and take a chance with me tonight

[Break:]
Sexy mama, oh sexy mama, girl cut the drama
I know you wanna dance with me
We tu mere kol aaja, dil di pukar hove (Come close to me, my hearts passion)
We tu sade naal aaja, dil di ayho chah hove. (Come with me, that's my hearts desire)

[Bridge:]
Kuhe te aa mahiyaa.. (Meet me by the well, my soul mate)
Wanna dance with me, take a chance with me
Sajna ve aaja, kuhe te aa mahiyaa (My love come! Meet me by the well)
Wanna dance with me, just take a chance with me? hooooooooo!

[Chorus1:]
Sexy mama, uuh sexy mama, girl cut the drama

Sajna ve, oh sajna ve, sajna ve (My love, oh my love, my love)
Come and take a chance with me tonite

Sajna ve, tu bas meri hi meri hain... (My love, you're mine, and mine alone)

[Chorus2:]
I know you wanna dance with me
Sajna ve, oh sajna ve, sajna ve (My love, oh my love, my love)
Come and take a chance with me tonite

Ah, hum tum akele... (Ah you and I... Alone!)
Phir kab miloge.. (When will we meet again?)
