You should get some of your own
Count that money
Get your game on
Get your game on
Get your, get your game on

You can't stop looking at me
Staring at me, be what I be
You can't stop looking at me
So get up out my face
You can't stop clicking at me
Writing 'bout me, tweeting 'bout me
I can't stop that's why they gon' be
My swagger's in check

Get on the floor
Get get get on the floor
My swagger's on check
Get on the floor
Get get get on the floor
I got it in check

You you can't stop shouting at me
Calling at me, be what I be
You can't stop looking at me
So get up out my way
You you can't stop youtubing me
On repeat, running this beat
You can't stop this... on me
I'm laughing all the way

Get get get on the floor
I got it in check
