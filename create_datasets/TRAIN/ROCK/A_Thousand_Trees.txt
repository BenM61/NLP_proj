Standing at the bus stop with my shopping 
In my hands when I'm overhearing elder 
Ladies as the rumors start to fly you can 
Hear them in the school yard, in the scrap yard 
In the chip shop, in the phone box, in the pool hall at 
The shoe stall every corner turned around 

It started with a school girl who was 
Running running home to her mam and 
Dad told them she was playing in the 
Change room of her local football side they 
Said tell us again so she told them again 
They said tell us the truth they found it hard 
To believe 'cause he taught our Steve he 
Even trained me taught uncle john who's 
Father of three 

But it only takes one tree to make 
A thousand matches 
Only takes one match to burn 
A thousand trees 
A thousand trees

You see it in the class room in the 
Swimming pool where the matchstick men 
Are made at the scouts hall at the football 
Where the wise we trust are paid they all 
Honor his name he did a lot for the game 
He got his name knocked up above the 
Sports ground gates but now they are 
Ripping them down stamping the ground 
Picture gathers dust behind the bar in the 
Lounge it takes one tree to make 

A thousand matches 
Only takes one match to burn 
A thousand trees 
A thousand trees

Wake up and smell the rain shake up he's 
Back to stay he hasn't been on a holiday 
His growing seeds don't believe why he's 
Been away in the school yard change room 
Playing fields bathroom phone box office 
Blocks corner turned around they keep 
Doubting the flame tossing the blame got 
His name knocked up above the sports 
Ground gates but now they're 
Ripping them down stamping the ground 
Picture gathers dust in the bar in the 
Lounge it takes one tree to make 

A thousand matches 
Only takes one match to burn 
A thousand trees 
A thousand trees
A thousand trees
