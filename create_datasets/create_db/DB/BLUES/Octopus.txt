This night wont end in time for me to see in you a warning
So close down and find your heart in the pit of your existence
You will see sense at some point

Nothings in your mind
In this space in time
So you took a ride
Now we meet inside

It's been showing me up
I've been loosing my touch
They aren't that far from here
Find the last piece is broken
It's what we need to be awoken
And our whole worlds been stolen 
And our whole faith is swollen
And I probably need to hold on
So stop and think and stroll along
There was a time and place

That was alive in faith
But just as time to pray is to eliminate the afraid to participate in a play
Well I guess I stayed too long
Well I guess I stayed too long
