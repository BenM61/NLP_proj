I'm an evil gal, don't you bother with me
Yes, I'm an evil gal, don't you bother with me
I'll empty your pockets and fill you with misery

I've got men to the left, men to the right
Men every day and men every night
I've got so many men, mmm, I don't know what to do
So I'm tellin' you, daddy, I ain't no good to you

I've got men in the east, men in the west
But my man here in Harlem always loves me the best
I'm an evil gal and I need an evil man
But I'm down in the dumps since I've lost him to Uncle Sam

If you want to be happy, don't hang around with me
Mmm, I said if you wanna be happy, don't hang around with me
'Cause I'm an evil gal and I want to set you free
