Well, it gettin'
Late on into the evenin' and I feel like, like blowin' my home
When I woke up this mornin' all I had, I had was gone
Late on into the evenin', child, I feel like, like blowin' my home
Well now, woke up this mornin', all I had was gone

Well, Brooks run into the ocean, the ocean run in, into the sea
If I don't find my baby, somebody gonna sure bury me
Brooks run into the ocean, boys, that old ocean run into the sea
Well now, if I don't find my baby, somebody sure gonna bury me

Well, minutes seemed like hours, but don't it seem like days?
Seems like my baby would stop her old evil way
Minutes seemed like hours, an hour seemed like days
Well, seems like my baby, whoo-hoo well, boy
Would stop her low down ways
