Girl, too late too late too late
Alright
Gotta take my time to sing my song
Yeah c'mon, alright

Girl I've been sitting thinking about you all day
Seem like a couple weeks
When it's only been a couple days
Since I felt your body next to mine
If I said I could wait another day I should be lying, yeah
Said I almost forgot
Just how good it can get
So bring your body here
So I can make you sweat
What I'm gonna do to you
I guarantee you won't regret
I promise and put it on everything
You'll love every bit of it, oh

You gonna get pleased tonight
When I lay you down, and put it down
Sexin' you all night long, till the early morn
You gonna get pleased tonight
Girl your body's weak from the touch of me
Laying next to you till you go to sleep

Can you meet 'bout nine o'clock
With a trench coat and sexy pumps
Have a drink or two to loosen up
And focus on what's ahead of us
Candlelight, some massage
Some foreplay just to start
Bodies intent must release
Sexual healin' is what I need
Wanna taste your lips
Grab your hips, make you feel my grip
Some ole freaky shit
Take you to ecstasy
If you know just what I mean
Come on over here your body's callin' me baby
Turn your cell phone off and your pager too
There'd be no interruptions once I'm into you

You gonna get pleased tonight
When I lay you down, and put it down
Sexin' you all night long, till the early morn
You gonna get pleased tonight
Girl your body's weak from the touch of me
Laying next to you, till you go to sleep

You gonna get pleased tonight
When I lay you down, and put it down
Sexin' you all night long, till the early morn
You gonna get pleased tonight
Girl your body's weak from the touch of me
Laying next to you, till you go to sleep

Make you love me
Like Whitney loves Bobby
Make you need me
Like Motown needed Smokey
You deserve all of this
Once I start I won't quit
Oh yea

Lord have mercy on me, oh alright
Mike I don't think they hear me Lord
Oh oh oh right yes sir oh no
I'm not gonna waste no time oh no
Come on, come on
See I know you feel me
You gotta feel me
'Cause I'm gonna please you

You gonna get pleased tonight
When I lay you down, and put it down
Sexin' you all night long, till the early morn
You gonna get pleased tonight
Girl your body's weak from the touch of me
Laying next to you till you go to sleep
You gonna get pleased tonight
When I lay you down, and put it down
Sexin' you all night long, till the early morn
You gonna get pleased tonight
Your body's weak from the touch of me
Laying next to you till you go to sleep
You gonna get pleased tonight
You gonna get pleased tonight
Oh yea, oh yea
Oh yea, oh yea
Oh, oh oh yea
