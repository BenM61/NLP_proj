You showed me the way
When I was someone in distress
A heart in search of happiness
You showed me the way

My sky was so gray
I never knew I'd feel a thrill
I couldn't dream a dream until
You showed me the way

The moment you found me
The shadows around me
Just disappeard from view
The world became rosy
Each corner so cozy
Darling, all because of you
You showed me the way
And if I've learned that love can be a paradise
For you and me
Here's all I can say
You showed me the way
