Thinkin' 'bout thinkin' of you
Summertime think it was June
Yeah, I think it was June
Layin' back head on the grass
Chewing gum havin' some laughs
Yeah, havin' some laughs

You make me feel like the one
Make me feel like the one
The one

Drinkin' by drinkin' for two
Drinkin' with you
When drinkin' was new
Sleepin' in the back of my car
We never went far
We didn't need to go far

You make me feel like the one
Make me feel like the one
The one
You make me feel like the one
Make me feel like the one
The one

I don't know where we are going now
I don't know where we are going now

Wake up call coffee and juice
Remembering you
What happened to you?
I wonder if we'll meet again
Talk about life since then
Talk about why did it end

You make me feel like the one
Make me feel like the one
The one
You make me feel like the one
Make me feel like the one
The one

I don't know where we are going now
I don't know where we are going now

So take a look at me now
So take a look at me now
So take a look at me now
So take a look at me now
So take a look at me now
So take a look at me now
So take a look at me now
So take a look at me now
So take a look at me now
So take a look at me now
So take a look at me now
So take a look at me now
So take a look at me now
So take a look at me now
So take a look at me now
So take a look at me now
So take a look at me now, now.
