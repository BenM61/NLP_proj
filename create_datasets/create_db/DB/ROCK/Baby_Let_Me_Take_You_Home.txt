Baby can I take you home
 Baby let me take you home
 I'll love you all my life
 You can bet I'll treat you right
 If you just let me take you home

 Baby can I dance with you
 Baby can I dance with you
 I'll do anything in this God-almighty world
 If you just let me dance with you

 Baby let me take you home
 Baby let me take you home
 I'll love you all my life
 You can bet I'll treat you right
 If you just let me take you home

 Well when I saw you baby
 I couldn't ignore you
 And I wanted you for my girl
 And when you said "Yeah!"
 I just couldn't care about
 Anybody else in this world
 You smiled at me
 Baby now I could see
 My life was planned out ahead
 You took my hand
 And it felt so good
 And this is what you said

 Baby won't you be my man
 Baby won't you be my man
 Yes I'll be your man
 And I'll do the best I can
 I want to be your man

 It's alright, it's alright!
 It's alright, it's alright!
 It's alright, it's alright!
