One day when life is taking you nowhere
And you need someone who really cares
When the love that you lost is found
And you will want me around
I'll meet you at the end of the rainbow

As you walk through this world I'll be there
With you wherever you may go
And although you'll never see me
One day you're gonna need me
At the end of the rainbow

Since you left I've felt the changes
You drained away my life in stages
But deep inside something lets me know
Though history still turns its pages
I will track you through the ages
And we will meet again
Somewhere at the end of the rainbow
At the end of the rainbow
