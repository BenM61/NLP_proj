Oh heart
I hear you beating
But her heart just ain't beating like you
Oh heart
You gotta watch out now
Or else she's gonna break you in two

Oh heart
You better believe it
Save yourself for somebody 
Don't make such a fuss
There's no hope for us
She don't care the way that you do
Let me tell you now heart
You're going crazy
Can't you hear a word that I say
Oh heart
She doesn't want you
There's no use in acting this way
Yes I'm tellin' you heart
You better believe me
Save yourself for somebody new
Don't make such a fuss
There's no hope for us
She don't care the way that you do

Heart
Please stop your pounding
Don't set yourself on something that's wrong
Oh heart
Now don't let her hear you
Come on now you gotta be strong

Oh heart
You better believe it
Save yourself for somebody 
Don't make such a fuss
There's no hope for us
She don't care the way that you do
Oh do
Let me tell you now heart
You're going crazy
Can't you hear a word that I say
Oh heart
She doesn't want you
There's no use in acting this way
Yes I'm tellin' you heart
You better believe me
Save yourself for somebody new
Don't make such a fuss
There's no hope for us
She don't care the way that you do
