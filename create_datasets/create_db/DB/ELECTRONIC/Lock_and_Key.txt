When there's comfort in pleasure and pleasure in pain
And I'm wondering if I?ll see you again
No tangled emotions dragging us down
And the texture of your voice the sweetest sound

I'm gonna wrap you up and take you home with me
Yo? Yo? Yeah Yeah
Treasured in my heart under lock and key.

When there's nothing to hold you? or holding you back
No chains of attachment? only basic facts
No strangled devotions? hemming us in
And the taste of your smile was the sweetest thing

I'm gonna wrap you up and take you home with me
Yo? Yo? Yeah Yeah
Treasured in my heart under lock and key

Under lock and key? my precious moments
My precious memories? and you know? and you know
I ain't never? never? I ain't never gonna let them go

Yo? Yo? Yeah Yeah

When there's comfort in pleasure and pleasure in pain
And I'm wondering? wondering if I?ll see you again
No tangled emotions? dragging us down
And the texture of your voice the sweetest sound

I'm gonna lock you up and take you home with me
Yo? Yo? Yeah Yeah
Treasured in my heart under lock and key.

Yo? Yo? Yeah Yeah
