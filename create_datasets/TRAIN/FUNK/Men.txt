I was talking to my girlfriend just the other day
I was not a bit surprised at what she had to say
On the subject of love we both were disillusioned
All day long we tried to find some kind of a solution

She said, "I'm tired of all that cheatin' and lyin'
Men won't change so I'm just gonna give up tryin'"
I said, "I feel the same way, too, but I
Can't give up so I don't know what to do"

I tell you, men
Can't live with 'em but you can't live without 'em
What can you do about 'em?
I tell you, men
Can't live with 'em but you can't live without 'em
I say we got a problem (oh, whoa)

Said, I know
I said we oughta tell them about their evil ways
I know they'll get defensive then turn around and say
"We're not alone out here 'cause women do it, too"
I said, "two wrongs don't make it right, they pay the price like you do"

She said, "uh-huh, I'm tired of all this cheatin' and lyin'
Men won't change so I'm just gonna give up tryin'"
I said, "I feel the same way, too, but I
Can't give up so I don't know what to do"

I tell you, men
Can't live with 'em but you can't live without 'em
What can you do about 'em?
I tell you, men
Can't live with 'em but you can't live without 'em
I know we got a problem

I tell you, men
Can't live with 'em but you can't live without 'em
What can you do about 'em?
I tell you, men
Can't live with 'em but you can't live without 'em
I know we got a problem

I hope that there's a man somewhere who knows that love's a treasure
But the only ones I've met so far has used this love for pleasure
They don't make commitments, they say "come deal with me"
But I don't want to buy his love with my prerogative

I really want to love you
But I can't accept the way you do the things you do, men
Can't live, can't live, can't live without 'em
Oh men, can't live, oh live
Oh, I know we got a problem I'll tell you, men
Can't live with 'em but you can't live without 'em
What can you do about 'em
I'll tell you, men
Can't live with 'em but you can't live without 'em
What can we do about 'em?
(Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
(Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
(Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa) I just don't know what to do about 'em
Men, can't live with 'em
But you can't live without 'em
No, what can we do about 'em?
I tell you, men
