We're dodging daggers that almost reach
Making mistakes they can never teach
But these silver clouds won't dissolve to black
Let's lose our feet to a leap of faith
And bigger skies that lie in wait
It's a long way down but I got your back

We're out on the edge of it all
Are you ready to freefall?
Ready to freefall?
We're out on the edge of it all
Are you ready to freefall?
Ready to freefall? Yeah

So feel the pull of an open thread
Unravel life 'til there's nothing left
It's a long way down but I got you now

We're out on the edge of it all
Are you ready to freefall?
Ready to freefall?
We're out on the edge of it all
Are you ready to freefall?
Ready to freefall?
Ready to freefall?
Ready to freefall?
Ready to freefall?
Ready to freefall?
Ready to freefall?
Ready to freefall?

We're out on the edge of it all
Are you ready to freefall?
Ready to freefall?
Ready to freefall?
Ready to freefall?
