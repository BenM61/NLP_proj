Gold all in my chain,

This ain't for no f*ck nigga, you're a real nigga then f*ck with me
This one for the hood niggas
Hipster bitches that shop at Lenox
Dark skinned, light skinned, Asian and White women
Hypebeasts we know aboutchea', don't buy shoes unless they popular
For the hoes, my nigga
That's pussy popping that Magic City, got that strong, my nigga
Then come match that shit with me, smoking mid, my nigga
Then don't pass that shit to me
This one for my niggas
And bitches 'bout that money, (Cash Out)
Gotta love, Chesire Bridge them bad hoes at Onyx
I don't f*ck with no snitches
So don't tell me who telling (No)
This one for them colleges
Them bad hoes at Spelman
Shout out to them freshmen
On Instagram straight flexin'
Popped a molly, I'm sweating woo
Popped a molly, I'm sweating woo
Momma always told me, boy count your blessings (Count 'em all)
In God I trust, so I kept counting them Franklins
I'm too fly, you know this, lemme give your ass a checklist
One gold watch, two gold chains six gold rings, it's nothing, (God Dayum)
OG Jordans, them high socks, no shirt on, I'm stunting, (Okay)
And this song for them f*ck niggas who hating on you this summer (F*ck 'em)
Talk shit behind your back, but won't say shit in public, (F*ck 'em)

Gold all in my chain,
Gold all in my ring
Gold all in my watch
