It's like su--
It's like su--

It's like sugar, so sweet
Good enough to eat
When I feel the funk, I give in
Get up on a-yo' feet

Why with the state that I'm in
Everybody here is dancing
All I wanna do is get ya
Body next to mine, yeah
Baby won't you stand up to me
Come around and make a move
Maybe teach ya something like this
Funky, funky groove

Get up on a-yo' feet
