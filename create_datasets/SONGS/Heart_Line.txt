Your crazy attitude is spoling everyone's fun
All you wanna do is take the money and the run

All I ever get from you is desert and sun
It's much too late to change your mind the damage is done
I've tried to say your point of view but baby come on
The situation's vacant now the season has gone
All I want to know is why you've taken so long
It's much too late to change the tune, I don't like this song

Heartline
You get your number changed
Bad sign
I want be calling again
Hard time
Your mind is always engaged
Good bye
Heart's on the line
Heart line

I'm through with making music on a telephone line
I'll pay the bill, you keep the change, show me where to sign
All you ever gave me was a hell of a time
It's much too late to change it, your words still won't apply
