When we first came here
We were cold and we were clear
With no colors on our skin
We were light and paper-thin

And when we first came here
We were cold and we were clear
With no colors on our skin
'Till you let the spectrum in

Say my name
And every color illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again

Say my name
And every color illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again

Say my name
And every color illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again

And when we come for you
We dressed up all in blue
With the ocean in our arms
Kissing eyes and kissing palms

When it's time to pray
We dressed up all in gray
With metal on our tongues
And silver in our lungs

Say my name
And every color illuminates
We are shining
And we'll never be afraid again

Say my name
And every color illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again

Say my name
And every color illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again

And when we come back we'll be dressed in black
And you'll scream our names aloud
And we won't eat and we won't sleep
We'll drag bodies from their graves

So say my name
And every color illuminates
And we are shining
And we'll never be afraid again
Say my name
As every color illuminates

Say my name
And every color illuminates
We are shining
And we'll never be afraid again

Say my name
And every color illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again

Say my name
We are shining
Say my name
Say my name
And we will never be afraid again
