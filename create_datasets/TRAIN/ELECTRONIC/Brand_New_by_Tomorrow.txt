Some things grow apart, some things grow together
Some things never start, ours is turning into memories
And guess there's no way to avoid a broken heart
What I can say is, I will never go very far

We'll be brand new by tomorrow
We'll be brand new by tomorrow

I used to love the games we played
But now I have to stay on my side of the street
I like the words we used to say to each other
But now our vocabulary's changed

Anytime you want me to pretend, I will
You'll always be my friend looking out the window sill
No sense in getting down on yourself
We put the trophy on the shelf

We'll be brand new by tomorrow
We'll be brand new by tomorrow

I used to love the games we played
But now I have to stay on my side of the street
I used to love the things we said to each other
But now our vocabulary's changed

We'll be brand new by tomorrow
We'll be brand new by tomorrow

We'll be brand new by tomorrow
We'll be brand new by tomorrow
