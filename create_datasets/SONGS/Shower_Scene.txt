I have news, good news from Notting Hill
The consignment of white gold has arrived for Mr. Anderson

In the rain, in the fall
In the mud, in the hall
In the main, in the fog
In the showers call my name

In the rain, in the fall
In the mud, in the hall
In the main, in the fog
In the showers call my name
Call my name

In the rain, in the stall
In the bath, in the hall
In the car, in the main
In the showers call my name

In the rain
Call my name

In the rain, in the fall
In the mud, in the hall
In the main, in the fog
In the showers

In the rain, in the stall
In the bath, in the hall
In the car, in the main
In the showers call my name

Call my name
In the rain
Call my name
Call my name
Call my name
Call my name

The world began in Eden and ended in Los Angeles
