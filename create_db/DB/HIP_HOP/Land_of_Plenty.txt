A long white cloud ancient lands, open field sacred ground,
Bays of plenty, the bluff, the cape, streaming sands, boiling place,
White water swells, bridges of old, deep clear nights, open shores,
Winter seasons bring out the best, summer nights in Auckland,

And my father used to say...
And we came to this land of plenty, and we came to this land of hope
And we came to this land of good times
And we came to this land of love, and we came to this land of love
(Land of love)

Mountain range, snow peak tops, fresh water stream, Fouveax Strait
Open caves that glow supreme, Black Sand Shores, Lion Rock
Monuments, Mission Bay, Cuba Street, Vulcan Lane
Westerly winds, sun and rains, beautiful days in the Wellington,

And my father used to say...
And we came to this land of plenty, and we came to this land of hope
And we came to this land of good times
And we came to this land of love, and we came to this land of love
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh mmm mmm...Ah ah ah...)

Desert roads, Mt. Ruapehu, The Picton Ferry decides your fate
Oval Square, civic centers, and Nelson Gorge where we lost a mate
Oamaru Via Timaru winding roads, sudden bends
Lake Taupo, Bethelis Beach, a word to the wise increase the peace

And my father used to say...(Mmmm)
And we came to this land of plenty
And we came to this land of hope (of hope)
We came to this land of good times (and someone havin' good times)
And we came to this land of love (oh oh) & we came to this land of love

(Ooh ooh ooh ooh, mmm mmm mmm, ah ah ah)
(It sounds like a good time, oh oh oh, mmm, mmm, mmm, yeah)

And we came to this land of plenty (mmm)
And we came to this land of hope (of hope, oh)
And we came to this land of good times
And we came to this land of love (of love)
And we came to this land of love (love, love, love)

(Ooh ooh ooh ooh, mmm, mmm, mmm)
