There's gonna be a change of season, mmm-hmmm
Indian summer look around and it's gone
Why you wanna save the best for last
We grow up so slowly and grow old so fast

We don't talk about forever
We'll just catch it while we can (on the way, I hope)
If I grab on to the moment
Don't let it slip away out of my hand

(What about now)
What about now
Forget about tomorrow
It's too far away
What about now
(What about now)
Close your eyes
Don't talk of yesterday
It's too far away, (too far away)
It's too far away
(What about now)

I'm coming out of the shadows
I'm getting off of this one way street
Blue memories they just gather dust
Leave them in the rain they turn into rust

And did you see the march to freedom, mmm-hmmm
Ever see savannah moon (in the middle of the rain)
All the people walking in a line
Said to the man, is it my time?

(What about now)
What about now
Forget about tomorrow
It's too far away (too far away)
What about now
(What about now)
Close your eyes
Don't talk of yesterday
It's too far away, (too far away)
It's too far away
(What about now)

In the walk of a lifetime
When you know it's the right time (bring it to me now)
I can't wait (I can't wait) until the ship comes in
I can't wait (I can't wait) starting all over again
The errors of a wise man
Make the rules for a fool

What about now
Forget about tomorrow
It's too far away (too far away)
(It's too far away)
What about now
Don't talk of yesterday
It's too far away,
It's too far away

(What about now)
What about now
Forget about tomorrow
It's too far away (too far away)
It's too far away
(What about now)
Close your eyes
Don't talk of yesterday
It's too far away
(It's too far away)
It's too far away
(It's too far away)
It's too far away
What about now

It's all about now, right now
Don't break the spell
Don't break the spell
Don't break the spell
(Don't break the spell)

It's all about now, right now
Now, right now

You're here right now
It's all about now

Don't worry about tomorrow

Don't break the spell
