Nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
I'm gonna search the whole world over
Find me somebody somewhere

Everybody needs someone, someone to call their own
Everybody needs someone, someone to call their own
But I've got to find somebody
Can't live in this world all alone

I'm leaving tomorrow to find the girl I'm thinking of
I'm leavin'g tomorrow to find the girl I'm thinking of
I'll be so happy when I find her
'Cause she's the only one I'll love
