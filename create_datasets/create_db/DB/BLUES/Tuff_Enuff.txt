I would walk ten miles on my hands and knees
Ain't no doubt about it baby it's you I aim to please
I'd wrestle with a lion and a grizzly bear
It's my life baby but I don't care

Ain't that tuff enuff
Ain't that tuff enuff
Ain't that tuff enuff
Ain't that tuff enuff

For you baby I would swim the sea
Nothing I'd do for you that's too tuff for me
I'd put out a burning building with a shovel and dirt
And not even worry about getting hurt

Ain't that tuff enuff
Ain't that tuff enuff
Ain't that tuff enuff
Ain't that tuff enuff

I'd work twenty four hours, seven days a week
Just so I could come home and kiss your cheek
I love you in the morning and I love you at noon
I love you in the night and take you to the moon

Ain't that tuff enuff
Ain't that tuff enuff
Ain't that tuff enuff
Ain't that tuff enuff

I'd lay in a pile of burning money that I've earned
And not even worry about getting burned
I'd climb the Empire State Building, fight Muhammad Ali
Just to have you baby close to me

Ain't that tuff enuff
Ain't that tuff enuff
Ain't that tuff enuff
Ain't that tuff enuff

Ain't that tuff enuff
Ain't that tuff enuff
Ain't that tuff enuff
Ain't that tuff enuff

Ain't that tuff enuff
Ain't that tuff enuff
Ain't that tuff enuff
