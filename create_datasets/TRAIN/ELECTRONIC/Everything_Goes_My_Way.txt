When I take you back, I thought you'd only up and run
But you are still here, I know
And when I take you back, I thought you'd only up and run
But you are still here, you are still here

And now everything goes my way
And now everything goes my way, it feels so good to have you back my love
I'm in love again
Love, I'm in love again

Why give it all on you, you shot a hole in my heart straight through
When you pushed me aside, three weeks I cried
But now you got me back, you know I'll never up and run
Yeah I stay in here, I stay right here

And now everything goes my way
And now everything goes my way, it feels so good to have you back my love
I'm in love again
Love, I'm in love again
Love, I'm in love again
Love, I'm in love again
