He's sitting right across from me
You're looking over casually
So I'm pretending not to see
You're trying to get his attention
So I decide to keep my cool
But you're out here on a mission
To be in my position

Girl I know you need a man
I could never understand
Why would you play yourself
Making it easier for any man to 
Wanna take you home
Make him wanna do me wrong
But he's not leaving me
You need to forget it
Go and find yourself a man

Now tell me why you'd wanna be
The one who'd have to creep to see
You know that he's here with me
Girl, tell me whats your intention
I've neevr been the jealous type
And I won't be the fool tonight
I don't wanna have to act un-ladylike

Girl I know you need a man
I could never understand
Why would you play yourself
Making it easier for any man to 
Wanna take you home
Make him wanna do me wrong
But he's not leaving me
You need to forget it
Go and find yourself a man

I Know it's hard for you to see
Any man you take, can be taken from you
Is that the place you wanna be
Any hearts you break
Your heart can be broken too
(Now tell me)
How would you feel
If you were in my shoes
And I tried to do this to you

Girl I know you need a man
I could never understand
Why would you play yourself
Making it easier for any man to 
Wanna take you home
Make him wanna do me wrong
But he's not leaving me
You need to forget it
Go and find yourself a man
