F*ck it I shagged her, without the usages of Viagra
Had her comin' like Niagara Falls when I bagged her
On the cellular my genitalia pitched the pelvis
Uh-huh, when her hips gyrate like Elvis
She tried to scurry hurry to finish very alone
Tell my doggs what's necessary 'bout how I bury the bone
She said "when you ready to blast, don't ask, say when"
Had her screamin' like lightin' a nuke when I was halfway in
In the past I used to send 'em back, give 'em the minimum
Now I leave 'em with venom on they chin when I'm bendin' 'em
Y'all know the name, get it engraved, sex slave
Stadium style, from the back, ass doin' the wave (Hey!)
Yellin' to me is a felony
Hell will be froze over when I celebrate celibacy, case closed
My Dick Rules Everything Around Me, D.R.E.A.M., get the ass
Without spendin' the cash now, look at 'em
Standin' tall with the veins all in it
Nuts ripped up with the brain all in it
My man Mike to see more Dick than Dastardly and Van Dyke
Together help me make it through the pain struggle and the bad weather
Yo, be on your way on your lesbian quest
I'm chillin' at the rest with Five Fingers of Death (Uh-huh)
And a whole lot of cash
'Specially if y'all sisters ain't up in the

Uhh, what
Vaginas diamond studded, you know you love it
Rub dick the right way, don't be cumin' quick like express trains
Make your Jones crazy
Swallow bones but no babies, to stick this gotta lick this
Tonight's entre is cherries bombay
And ta-ta's flavored cafe latte
Broke-ass bumbaclaat let's rock can't play with mines
Need nine inches danglin', pinchin' my spine (Ow)
Hangin' ten with the best of wenches, that never flinches
Bench your game, part four won't score
Gotta hit the backboard, like it raw backdoor
Wanta pause hardcore porn style, ba-bay
Who do it better? Say my name backwards and spell each letter
Be havin' grams of spasm, leavin' on a stretcher
And gets you wetter and incredible, suction
Punk-ass you're wack pumpin', ready to rupture
Bustin' wildly like N.Y.P.D
So typically we, wasn't ready for the fantasy freak
Don't sleep, privately I peep with devices
Energizers keep me vibratin in a crisis
Representin' my bitches, throwin' clitorises
Like ventriloquists limp, penises don't kiss these pussy lipses
Please you play, clay with top grade shit
I seen bigger dicks in pre-K
(Nah!)

The dick!
The dick!

The ass!
The ass!
The ass!
The ass!
