Ten thousand bedrooms
Ten thousand bedrooms
Ten thousand bedrooms are all too few
If you're a special kind of dreamer
With a dreamer's point of view
You need ten thousand bedrooms at least
To do all the dreaming that you got to do

And if you want a special rainbow
Splashing across your skies of blue
You need ten thousand bedrooms at least
And just watch those rainbows come in to view

Who needs a living room a kitchen or a sunroom
All I need is a bed for my head and they're all combined in one room
Ten thousand bedrooms ought to do it and I'll have them before I'm through
'Cause when you got lots of dreaming to do
Then ten thousand bedrooms are all too few
