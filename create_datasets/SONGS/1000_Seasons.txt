So I hope you'll keep these memories
In a diary 
On the nightstand, by your bed
A long detailed anthology
Of all the mysteries
Locked away inside your head
Because it looks like I'll miss this
Another Christmas, another birthday, another round
One more summer, one more season, one more winter without a sound

Write it, write it, write it down
I will read it when the days don't look so bad
Write it, write it, write it down
It's the story of a 1000 seasons' past
So now we have all this technology to send apologies
That just swim inside our heads
Our words are bouncing off the satellites
Through the lonely nights
Landing right inside our hands
The words are not as romantic, as they cross the Atlantic
In some virtual cry for help
Spend one more summer, one more season, one more winter by yourself

Write it, write it, write it down
I will read it when the days don't look so bad
Write it, write it, write it down
It's the story of a 1000 seasons' past

Ooh-ooh 
Aah-Aah
Ooh-ooh 
Aah-Aah
Ooh-ooh

The words are not as romantic, as they cross the Atlantic
In some virtual cry for help
So,

Write it, write it, write it down
I will read it when the days don't look so bad
Write it, write it, write it down
It's the story of a 1000 seasons' past

Write it, write it, write it down
I will read it when the days don't look so bad
Write it, write it, write it down
It's the story of a 1000 seasons' past

Ooh-Ooh 
Ooh-Ooh 
Ooh-Ooh
