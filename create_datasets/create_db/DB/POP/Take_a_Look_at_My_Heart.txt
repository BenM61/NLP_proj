I seen my old lady's boyfriend.
He don't look nothing like me,
'Cept for a bit of confusion;
Same kind she laid on me.

You don't know what you're getting into;
She's gonna tear you apart.
You're going places I've been to;
Take a look at my heart.
Take a look at my heart.

You're pro'bly sending her flowers
And talking to her on the phone.
You're gonna get it together
And find yourself all alone.

Do you think you can be her lover
And not become her fool?
Do you think that you are the exception to the rule?

You're gonna hate all her girlfriends
And everything that they say.
You ask me how do I know this?
They come around every day.
