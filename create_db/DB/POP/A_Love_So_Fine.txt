Oh yes, he's the darling,
And I'm so glad that he'll be mine
Yesterday he said he wants me
To share a love so fine
(A love so fine)

When he smiled
It is for me only
And his kisses are so divine
From now on I won't be lonely,
'Cause we're sharing
A love so fine
(A love so fine)

All the girls are jealous of him,
That's not really hard to see,
They would never try to love him,
His love belongs to me

All the girls are jealous of him,
That's not really hard to see,
They would never try to love him,
His love belongs to me

Our love will last forever,
And forever's a long, long time
And I know no one will ever,
Ever break up a love so fine
(A love so fine)

Oh yeah, a love so fine
(A love so fine, a love so fine)
Yeah, yeah, a love so fine
(A love so fine, a love so fine)
