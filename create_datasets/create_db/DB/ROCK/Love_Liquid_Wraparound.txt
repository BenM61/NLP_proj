Love
Love liquid wraparound
You're getting me down
And you're coming around

Love
Queen you are crowned
You're feeling down and I'm coming around

You can make me feel much better
I can make you fell much better

When I look at you I swear I lose control
Once I have you I'll never let you go
How I want you when I touch you know I need and want to please you
Love to love you need to feel you
Baby I go mad without you love
I have to have you now
