I will admit it that you're something special
I'm now convinced, Marguerite

The flame may be hot but you can't resist it
To know is to touch Marguerite
Mama, mama, Marguerite, Marguerite, Marguerite

I don't know whether to over or under estimate you
Whether to over or under estimate you
For when I come over you then put me under
Personal taste is a matter of gender, Marguerite

Don't slip my name while you're making love
Say you were dreaming, Marguerite

Thou shall not commit the seventh commandment
Most precious of all, Marguerite
Mama mama, Marguerite, Marguerite, Marguerite

I don't know whether to over or under estimate you
Whether to over or under estimate you
For when I come over you then put me under
Personal taste is a matter of gender, Marguerite

I don't know whether to over or under estimate you
Whether to over or under estimate you
For when I come over you then put me under
Personal taste is a matter of gender, Marguerite
