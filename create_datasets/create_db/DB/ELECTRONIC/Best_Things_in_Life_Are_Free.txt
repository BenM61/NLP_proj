Are you ready?
Free, free, baby,
Boy, when you look at me,
Do you judge me by my cover?
Got to be kiddin' me, to think that I'm that kind of lover
I don't mean to disagree, sorry, you can't buy my kisses
Open your eyes and see,
True love comes for free

I'm keepin' my heart open, and hopin' you won't stab me in it
'Cause I've been in love before, and when I had to pay I didn't 
I'll lose my sanity, tryin' to measure your intentions
What do you want from me?
How much will it be?

No more than you're willing to give
'Cause you won't pay nothin' for this good lovin', it's for free

And I won't make you promises,
I'll just do all I can to be your lover 'cause I understand

[Chorus]
The best things in life are free,
Now that I've discovered what you mean to me
The best things in life are free,
Now that we've got each other 
The best things in life are free

Come on now,
Oh, yeah

Alright, I like that,
Now, Janet

Oh, Luther

I know you are my baby, my one and only baby
You said it twice, I'll say it thrice my baby baby baby

I've got so much for you, 
And it's easy to give it when I know you feel the same way too
That's all I expect from you,
Just do all that you can to be my lover 'cause I understand,
I do, (Janet: hoo) I do (Janet: hoo, hoo)
They say,

[Chorus: x2]

[Janet]
BBD tell 'em 'bout free

Sister sister kickin' all that jazz
Ain't it funny, honey? Huh? what you never had
A lot of bone structure, I can make it last
A minute to win it, I deep fill the past
Materio went perio, so get the info
You know, I know, it's not about the dough
So maybe baby, if you want to be my lady
I'll forget the riches and the other itches
Mo' money, mo' money, Jam & Lewis here we go
Mo' money, mo' money, Luther, Janet here we go
Mo' money, mo' money, Biv, DeVoe here we go
Ralph T. (that's me). The best things in life are for free

Free, baby

No more than you're willing to give
'Cause you won't pay me nothin' for this good lovin', it's for free

And I won't make you promises
You see,

I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be, we're gonna be, I'm gonna 
Be do, The very best I can, to be your lover 'cause I understand

It feels good, it feels good, it feels good, it feels so good

Ha, ho, oh, wait a minute, I still don't think they've got it
Let's tell them one more time
Check it out!
Everybody needs to know that,

[Chorus: x2]

Don't ya know, don't ya know,
The very best love in life is free, 
And I'm free, yeah
