When I get home from work
I'll call up all my friends
And we'll go bust up something beautiful we'll have to build again

When I get home from work
I'll wrestle off my clothes
And leave em right inside the front door
'Cause nobody's home to know

You see a hammer finds a nail
And a freight train needs the rails
And I'm doin' what I'm on this earth to do

And I don't think on why I'm here where it hurts
I'm just lucky to have the work
Sunday morning I'm too tired to go to church
But I thank God for the work

When I get my reward my work will all be done
And I will sit back in my chair beside the father and the son
No more holes to fill and no more rocks to break
And no more loading boxes on the trucks for someone else's sake

'Cause a hammer needs a nail
And the poor man's up for sale
Guess I'm doin' what I'm on this earth to do

And I don't think on why I'm here where it hurts
I'm just lucky to have the work
And every night I dream I'm drowning in the dirt
But I thank God for the work

And the day will come when I'll find a reason
And somebody proud to love a man like me
My back is numb, my hands are freezing
What I'm working for is something more than free

And I don't think on why I'm here where it hurts
I'm just lucky to have the work
Sunday morning I'm too tired to go to church
But I thank God for the work
And I thank God for the work
