You stare out in yellow eyes larger than my mind;
In viscous pools of joy, relaxing, we glide
It's all too beautiful
For my mind to bear.
And, as we shimmer into sleep, something's unshared.

But, seeing the flower that was there yesterday,
A tear forms just behind the soft peace of your shades
The world's too lonely
For a message to slip
But between the dying rails of peace
You trip.

The petals that were blooming are just paper in your hand;
Your eyes, which were clear in the night, are opaque as you stand
It was too beautiful
For it to last
These visions shimmer and fade out of
The glass.
