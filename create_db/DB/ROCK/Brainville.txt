I've heard about a place, where they enlarge yer space
Don't cost ya very much, they seem to know their stuff,
They take pity on the small ones

So I want to go to Brainville. Let's get in
And overcome my inexperience
I want to go to Brainville. Let's get in
And be the first one on the block that does.

They say it's the one thing everyone should have
I know it must look bad.

I know I need the help
They'd take me I can tell
They take pity on the small ones

I want to go to Brainville. Let's get in
And overcome my inexperience
I want to go to Brainville. Let's get in
And be the first on the block that does.
