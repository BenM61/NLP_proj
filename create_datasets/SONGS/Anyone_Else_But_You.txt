You're a part time lover and a full time friend
The monkey on your back is the latest trend
I don't see what anyone can see
In anyone else but you

I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of the train
I kiss you all starry eyed, my body's swinging from side to side
I don't see what anyone can see
In anyone else but you

Here is the church and here is the steeple
We sure are cute for two ugly people
I don't see what anyone can see
In anyone else but you

The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me
So why can't you forgive me?
I don't see what anyone can see
In anyone else but you

I will find my niche in your car
With my MP3, DVD, rumple-packed guitar
I don't see what anyone can see
In anyone else but you

Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B A start
Just because we use cheats doesn't mean we're not smart
I don't see what anyone can see
In anyone else but you

You are always trying to keep it real
I'm in love with how you feel
I don't see what anyone can see
In anyone else but you

We both have shiny happy fits of rage
You want more fans, I want more stage
I don't see what anyone can see
In anyone else but you

Don Quixote was a steel driving man
My name is Adam, I'm your biggest fan
I don't see what anyone can see
In anyone else but you

Squinched up your face and did a dance
You shook a little turd out of the bottom of your pants
I don't see what anyone can see
In anyone else but you

But you
