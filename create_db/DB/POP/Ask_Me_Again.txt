Ask me again
Who's the one I've begun to adore
Ask me again
Whose the partners my heart clambers for
Who is the who that has ties in bow knot
So that I know not just where I met
Who is it makes my friends all find
That I have a one track hard at mind

Oh ask me again 
Let me tell how I fell from the start
One look and then 
Couldn't govern the love in my heart
Who is it that I looked high and low for
Whom will go for my whole life through
Please ask me again
Let shout to the world its you

Ask me again
Whose the moon and the stars and the sun
Who's the why and the where and the what
Who is that I looked everywhere for
To care to care for
My whole life through
Please ask me again
Cause just love to say its you

Who is the only one I fancy
Whom will I fancy
My whole life through
Please ask me again
Let me shout to the world
Its you
