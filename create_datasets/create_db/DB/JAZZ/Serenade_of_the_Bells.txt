In the sleepy town of San Juanita,
There's a story that a padre tells,
Of a gay senor and senorita,
And the serenade of the bells.
Seems they asked the padre for permission
To be married early in the spring,
But their folks had made just one condition
That the mission bells had to ring.
Ev'ry one knew the bells were broken,
And hadn't sounded for a long, long time.
Then one night the village was astounded
For the bells began to chime!
Still the bells are broken, goes the story
But if in your heart a true love dwells
They will ring for you in all their glory,
That's the serenade of the bells.
