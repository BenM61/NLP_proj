Oh baby!
Just wanna lay right here with you!
Baby I just wanna lay with you!
I know you have work,
But I would love for you to stay with me,
For a little while longer!
I'm asking a lot but I don't want you to go away,
Cause I can't get you out of my mind, girl!
I could just look at you,
All day long,
Your beautiful smile I just
Can't go wrong!
And only if you didn't have to leave,
You could be relaxed and chill with me.

Let's not leave our house today,
I just wanna lay with you, with your body close to mine!
Room service will be on their way,
I just wanna lay with you,
I can't get enough of you girl!

Oh, baby,
You're making it hard for me to leave!
I wish I wouldn't have to go,
So next time I'm around let's hope it will rain,
So we could just stay in.
Cause I just wanna lay with you!
I could just look at you
All day long,
Your beautiful smile I just
Can't go wrong!
And only if you didn't have to leave,
We could relax and just chill in

Let's not leave our house today,
I just wanna lay with you, with your body close to mine!
Room service will be on their way,
I just wanna lay with you,
I can't get enough of you girl!

Uhu, one night with you is like Heaven!
Like Heaven!
I don't wanna go from here,
Oh, baby!
Kissing your neck while you're sleeping,
Sleeping!
Lay with me!

Let's not leave our house today,
I just wanna lay with you, with your body close to mine!
Room service will be on their way,
I just wanna lay with you,
I can't get enough of you girl!
