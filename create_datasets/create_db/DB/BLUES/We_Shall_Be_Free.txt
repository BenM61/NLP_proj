In the mornin' you shall be free 
'fore day you shall be free hear me say 
You shall be free when the good lord sets you free

I was down in the hen house other night awful dark
I didn't have no light I reached for a chicken
I got me a goose a man come out, I had to turn him loose

I jumped a gully you shall be free I jumped a rose bush you shall be free
You shall be free when the good lord sets you free

Vpreacher an' a rooster had a terrible fight 
Preacher knocked the rooster clean out o' sight 
Preacher told the rooster that'll be all right 
Meet ya at the hen house tomorrow night

You shall be free in the mornin' 
You shall be free you know, rooster
You shall be free when the good lord sets you free

I's down in the hen house on my knees 
I thought I heard a chicken sneeze 
Only a rooster sayin' his prayers 
Thankin' his god for the hens upstairs

Here's the preacher you shall be free 
He's a-singin' you shall be free 
Takin' up c'llection you shall be free 
When the good lord sets you free

Oh, some folks says times is hard 
Preacher says put your trust in god matter no difference
Don't you see a hog can't run too fast for me

Gettin' that
You shall be free 
Gettin' that hogeye you shall be free 
Eatin' up chitt'lin's you shall be free 
When the good lord sets you free

As some people say, a preacher won't steal 
I caught two down in my corn fiel' 
One had a bushel, other had a peck 
Other'n had a roastin' ear down his neck

You shall be free gettin' roastin' ears 
You shall be free gettin' dried corn
You shall be free when the good lord sets you free

Oh the gun said boom an' the hog said
Jumped on 'er with all o' his will 
How that hog gets 

You shall be free I don't care you shall be free forget about
You shall be free when the good lord sets you free
