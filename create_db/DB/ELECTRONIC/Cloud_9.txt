Fault
Fault's the reason why we point the gun
(Point the gun)
And when we give love
Love must be the reason why we run
Why we run

One step closer
You and I get older
We will never ever wake up
Give me closure
When you're at my shoulder
We will never ever wake up
One step closer
You and I get older
We will never ever wake up
We will never ever wake up

Feels like doin' time up on Cloud Nine
You and me, we make up our own minds
But that's fine
'Cause we're up on Cloud Nine
Fill our heart with bottles of cheap wine
We don't mind
'Cause we're up on Cloud Nine
(Up on Cloud Nine)
'Cause we're up on Cloud Nine
We don't mind

Fault
Fault's the reason why we point the gun
(Point the gun)
And when we give love
Love must be the reason why we're young
Why we're young

One step closer
You and I get older
We will never ever wake up
Give me closure
When you're at my shoulder
We will never ever wake up
One step closer
You and I get older
We will never ever wake up
We will never ever wake up

Feels like doin' time up on Cloud Nine
You and me, we make up our own minds
But that's fine
'Cause we're up on Cloud Nine
Fill our heart with bottles of cheap wine
We don't mind
'Cause we're up on Cloud Nine

('Cause we're up on Cloud Nine)
'Cause we're up on Cloud Nine
('Cause we're up on Cloud Nine)

Feels like doin' time up on Cloud Nine
You and me, we make up our own minds
But that's fine
'Cause we're up on Cloud Nine
Fill our heart with bottles of cheap wine
We don't mind
'Cause we're up on Cloud Nine
'Cause we're up on Cloud Nine
You and me, we make up our own minds
We don't mind
'Cause we're up on Cloud Nine
You and me, we make up our own minds
