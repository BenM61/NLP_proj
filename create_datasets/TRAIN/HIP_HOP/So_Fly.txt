You're so fly lady

You look so fly, so cool 
Tell me girl can I talk to you 
I'm only in town for one night 
Let me know if you're down to ride
So fly, so cool 
Tell me girl, can I talk to you 
I'm only in town for one night 
Let me know if you're down to ride

(Yeah are you ready to ride baby)

If you think you're lonely now
Just wait until tonight, girl,
I know I've been on the road
And away from home, but I've
Been feignin' for you,
Dreamin' of you 
And what I'm gonna do 
When I have you alone
You heard the message on your cell phone
Me sayin' daddy's home (Ohh wow)
I'm about to put it down
Got you runnin' around
Half naked around the house
And this isn't just fast-sex 
We're making love until 
We both climax,
I know you miss me, 
I can tell by the way 
You kiss me,
There's no other place
You'd rather be 
But here in ecstasy,
With me,
I'm that someone who's 
Gonna love you right 
Even if I'm home for just one night 
You know it's all right (Ohhh wow)
It's me 'n' you zig zag 'n' mary jane
Your love is got me never wanting to 
Leave the game

You look so fly, so cool 
Tell me girl can I talk to you 
I'm only in town for one night 
Let me know if you're down to ride
So fly, so cool 
Tell me girl, can I talk to you 
I'm only in town for one night 
Let me know if you're down to ride

Twistin' those hips

Better than to kick it

One night rendezvous

But I'ma treat you right
