The sun is up
The sun is high
The sun is in your eye
You're shades they mirror everything
They're leaving me quite blind
This game is up
We've had enough
And we can compromise
Take those glasses off your face
I want to see your eyes
I read a book
A funny book
A book about your life
You call yourself a free man
But all you did was time
When time will judge
And time will heal
And time will bury us all
And now you're in your coffin
With a satellite dish installed

Only this other fool surrounds you
Only this other fool surrounds you
You have no one to love only this other fool surrounds you
Only this other fool surrounds you
Only this other fool surrounds you

You have no one to love
