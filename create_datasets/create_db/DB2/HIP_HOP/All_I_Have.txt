I feel so unsure trembling you open ur door
Your eyes glistening 
Silly me 
I'm already missin' you

And this is all I have  
All I have to give
All I have to give
This one last kiss
I know its not enough
I thought love would never end
One more touch is all I have

You said that we'd forever be in love
And you showed me life like I never knew
Things I never even dreamed of
But your smile just don't seem the same
And when you tell me you feel it to
I'm not sure who's to blame 
Cause I gave everything

And this is all I have  all I have to give
All I have to give this one last kiss
I know its not enough
I thought our love would never end
One more touch is all I have

I cant believe (I cant believe)
This love is leavin' me 
Love is leavin' me
And I cant believe (I cant believe)
What we've come to be (What we've come to be)
What we've come to be

And I wish I could make it like it used to be
Cant believe I'm through lovin' you
And your through lovin' me ooh
And in the middle of my final tear
You call out my name 
My name
You cry out my name
But it can never be the same 
Cause this is all I have

And this is all I have all I have to give
All I have to give 
(Your smile don't seem the same) 
This one last kiss
I know its not enough
I thought our love would never end
One more touch is all I have

And this is all I have  
All I have to give
All I have to give
This one last kiss
I know its not enough
I thought love would never end
One more touch is all I have

And this is all I have  
All I have to give
All I have to give
This one last kiss
I know its not enough
I thought love would never end
One more touch is all I have
