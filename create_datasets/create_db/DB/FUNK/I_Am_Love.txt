If I talk too much you see
I'm tryin' desperately to be understood
If I seem a little shy
It's for all the times that I had my heart in the dark

Like in all the story books
The white knight came and took the little girl
Alone in the world
You don't try to overwhelm
When I sometimes undersell the way I feel
Now I believe

I am love, love
Always here to give you what you need
Like you do for me
I am love, love
For the first time I know that it's real
Oh, you make me feel
I am love

You mend the ragged edge
Of a heart that's always fled the merry-go-round
When I tell my little jokes
Your eyes shine as I float in the clouds
I'm not comin down

You always build me up
And you're not afraid to touch what's on my mind
You'll always find

I am love, love
Waiting here to give you what you need
Like you do for me

You walked beside the wind
Pushing me to mend
Teaching me to live today
Oh, all of my dreams have just come true
Say that you are here to stay

I am love, love
Waiting here to give you what you need, yeah
Like you do for me
I am love, love
For the first time I know that its real
Oh, you make me feel
I am love

I am love
Always here to give you what you need
Like you do for me
I am love
