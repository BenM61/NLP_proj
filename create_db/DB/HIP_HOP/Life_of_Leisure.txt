Hey what you'd say your name was
Rubber back
You got a brain you ain't using
You got charm you're abusin'

Too busy out there floosin'
Or lying at home snoozin'

Time moves along

You don't have a life anymore
Time moves along
You don't have a job
I got four

Spend my money on cigarettes
Midnight dragon and off track bets
Get up at three
Turn on the TV

For all I know you got a dangerous disease
So I gotta move along
I gotta move along
Why you want to waste away lover of the life of leisure

Nature has it

You got no cajones
A dog in heat
A one trick pony
Lover of the life of leisure

I love to love you but I might leave you
I'm a lover of the life of leisure if you don't like it you can leave it
Time on your hands
Rubber on your back

Rubber in your hand
Too much time on your back
