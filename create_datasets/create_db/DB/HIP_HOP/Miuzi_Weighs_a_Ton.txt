Step back, get away, give the brother some room
        You got to turn me up when the beat goes boom
        Lyric to lyric, line to line
        Then you'll understand my reputation for rhyme
        Cause my rhyme reputation depends on what
        Style of record my DJ cuts
        His slice, dice, super mix so nice
        So bad, you won't dispute the price
        It's plain to see, it's a strain to be
        Number one in the public eye enemy
        I'm wanted in 50, almost 51
        States where the posse got me on the run
        It's a big wonder why I haven't gone under
        Dodgin' all types of microphone thunder
        A fugitive missin' all types of hell
        All this because I talk so well
        When I,

        Rock, get up, get down
        Miuzi weighs a ton

        The match up title, the expression of thrill
        For elite to compete and attempt to get ill
        If looks could kill, I'd chill until
        The public catches on to my material
        Ducks criticize my every phase of rapture
        Can't wait to read the headlines of my capture
        Accused of assault, a 1st degree crime
        Cause I beat competitors with my rhymes
        Tongue whipped, pushed, shoved and tripped
        Coocked from the hold of my Kung Fu grip
        And if you want my title, it would be suicidal
        From my end, it would be homicidal
        When I do work, you get destroyed
        Make all the paranoid, try to avoid
        The Public Enemy seat I've enjoyed
        This is no kid and I'm no toy boy

        Rock, get up, get down
        Miuzi weighs a ton

        I'm a Public Enemy but I don't rob banks
        I don't shoot bullets and I don't shoot blanks
        My style is supreme, number one is my rank
        And I got more power than the New York Yanks
        If miuzy wasn't heavy I'd probably fire it
        I'd make you walk the plank if I was a pirate
        If they made me a King, I would be a tyrant
        If you want to get me, go ahead and try it
        Snatcher, dispatcher, biter never been a
        Instead of takin' me out, take a girl to dinner
        The level of comp has never been thinner
        It's a runaway race where I'm the winner
        It's unreal, they call the law
        And claimed I had started a war
        It was war they wanted and war they got
        But they wilted in the heat when miuzi got hot

        Rock, get up, get down
        Miuzi weighs a ton

        My style versatile said without rhymes
        Which is why they're after me on my back
        Lookin' over my shoulder, seein' what I write
        Hearin' what I say, they wonderin' why
        Why they can't ever compete on my level
        Superstar status is my domain
        Understand my rhythm, my pattern of lecture
        And then you'll know why I'm on the run
        This change of events results in a switch
        Lateral movements of my vocal pitch
        It eliminates pressure on the haunted
        But the posse is around so I got to front it
        Plus employ tactics so coy
        And leave no choise but to destroy
        Soloists, groups and what they say
        And all that try to cross my way
