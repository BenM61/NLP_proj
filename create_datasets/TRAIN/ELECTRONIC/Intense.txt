Put your socks on and pull 'em up 
We got a long ride, and a velvet chair to sit on 
E-mail junkies press your buttons now 
The rocket fuel will last us till we push the boat out 
And everybody wants to know 
Is what we're given what we get 
I guess the answer is we don't know yet 

Intense 
(I know you're feelin' it 
but what's it comin' to when we wanna 
get a rocket ship outta here?) 

Intense 
(I know you're feelin' it 
but what's it comin' to when we wanna 
get a rocket ship outta here?) 

I just got to tell you 
Yell it to ya girls and boys 
We're gettin' hotter 
You feel it too? 
Gotcha! 

Intense 
Put your smile on and keep it sweet 
You got your ammunition on your back but you can't use it 
Are you a good soul or a bad egg? 
And is our future wounded by philosophies our daddy had? 
And everybody wants to see 
What the mirror cannot see 
Or is it something that we just can't see yet? 

Intense 
I know you're feelin' it 
But what's it comin' to when we wanna 
Get a rocket ship outta here?

I know you're feelin' it 
But what's it comin' to when we wanna

I just got to tell you 
Yell it to ya girls and boys 
We're gettin' hotter 
Gotcha! 

Intense 
Days go by and by 
Like your blood is running through you 
Sometimes we sit and watch the world cry 
Sunny starts the day 
And rain it ends 
But still they pass us by 
Like stress has got its hold on you 
You never sit back, 
Realise you're so

I just got to tell you 
Yell it to ya 
We're gettin' hotter 
Gotcha!
