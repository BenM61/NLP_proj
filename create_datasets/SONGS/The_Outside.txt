What if I'm not the same
What if I never let go of the blame
What if you drag me back again
What if I would let you just pretend
I erase this memory
I escape this gravity
Is that how I used to be
Is that the price of my identity

I'm standing on the outside
I'm looking in on what you can't hide
Your dying on the inside
Because now I can see the lies from the outside

What if I stand ashamed
What if I can't let go of the pain
What if I have something to lose
What if I've got nothing left to prove
I replace this life you stole
I replace the world I know
What if you were always wrong
And if I said I knew it all along

I'm standing on the outside
I'm looking in on what you can't hide
Your dying on the inside
Because now I can see the lies from the outside

I'm not you
I will never be you
I won't let you pull me through

I'm standing on the outside
I'm looking in on what you can't hide
Your dying on the inside
Because now I can see the lies from the outside

I'm standing on the outside
I'm looking in on what you can't hide
Your dying on the inside
Because now I can see the lies from the outside
