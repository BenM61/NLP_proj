What could make me think that I could live on borrowed love?
Now I see that I could never live on borrowed love
It's three-o-one in the morning, another sleepless night
I feel your presence with me and it doesn't feel right

And then it starts flowing through me
From my feet right to my head
Then I scream calling out your name
I want you back in my bed, my bed

What could make me think that I could live on borrowed love?
Like a drummer always beating the insides of my soul
Hidden feelings always seeking
The touch they knew so well in the places that matter

What could make me think that I could live on borrowed love?
I can't eat, I can't sleep, thinking about who you're with
Are you happy making me crazy? You were the best I ever had
What could make me think that I could live on borrowed love?

The pain of too much pleasure is all so clear to me
After you go nothing but ache to fill my emptiness
Emptiness, emptiness

What could make me think that I could live on borrowed love?
What could make me think that I could live on borrowed love?
What could make me think that I could live on borrowed love?
