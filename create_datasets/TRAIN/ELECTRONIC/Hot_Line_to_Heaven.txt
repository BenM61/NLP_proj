With your smile you're making plans
You've got the world right in the palm of your hands.
Everything you touch is gold but your future life is bought and sold.
It seems to me that you've got it made
But you never show that you're afraid.
Now the voices in your head they make you scream
And drive you mad.

You're on a hot line to heaven
Now you're all alone
Riding on a hot line
Riding on a hot line to heaven

Standing all on your own.
Staring eyes as cold as stone
I want to be at the sands alone.
Reaching out to cry for help

Once a man but now you're just a shell.
You can make a deal
You make the break
But you're heading for an early grave.
You've got to find it
Got to try

Something special to get you high.
You're on a hot line to heaven
Now you're all alone
You're on a hot line to heaven
Now you're all alone

It seems to me that you've got it made
But you're heading for an early break.
But now some voices in your head
They make you scream and drive you mad.

You're on a hot line to heaven
Now you're all alone
You're on a hot line to heaven
Now you're all alone
You're on a hot line to heaven
Now you're all alone
