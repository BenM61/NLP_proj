(intro)

I speak in verses
Prophecies & curses
...I hate my life.

(verse)

No miracle is coming ...(hate you)
It's just a hole 
Nothing's wrong with you
Must maintain control 

Everyone's asking questions
No place is safe
I'll forfeit resurrection
To escape the pain

... I hate my life.


I HATE MY LIFE.

(verse)

I speak in verses
Prophecies & curses

This storm of thorns is growing ...(hate me)
There's no end in sight 
Chaos claws my jaw
& incites a mental riot 

I'm in the mouth of madness
With a tongue of poetry
I ate the spine of Atlas
Now the world is crushing me

... I hate my life.


I HATE MY LIFE.

(outro)

BURIED ALIVE BEHIND ENEMY LINES
SURROGATE CHILD FOR THE SINS OF ALL MANKIND

HATE!!

BURIED ALIVE BEHIND ENEMY LINES
(buried alive, buried alive)

FOR THE SINS OF ALL MANKIND!
