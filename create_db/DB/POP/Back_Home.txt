I'm gonna need you to raise your glass
I don't care what you put in it
Here's to nights that you can't take back
We live hard but we love to laugh

And we all thought that we'd get rich fast
Hop the plane out for greener grass
Found out the green is cash
Don't compare to the friends that last

See, we won't forget where we came from
The city won't change us
We beat to the same drum
No, we won't forget where we came from
The city can't change us
We beat to the same drum, the same drum

(Hey!) lala da da da-da da-da
lala da da da-da da-da doe
(Hey!) and no matter where we go
We always find our way back home

(Hey!) lala da da da-da da-da
lala da da da-da da-da doe
(Hey!) and no matter where we go
We always find our way back home

So here's to the cheap sunglasses
Redbull and minivans and
People who had your back when
The world didn't understand

See, we won't forget where we came from
The city won't change us
We beat to the same drum
No, we won't forget where we came from
The city can't change us
We beat to the same drum, the same drum

(Hey!) lala da da da-da da-da
Lala da da da-da da-da doe
(Hey!) and no matter where we go
We always find our way back home

(Hey!) lala da da da-da da-da
Lala da da da-da da-da doe
(Hey!) and no matter where we go
We always find our way back home

When ties loosen
We're losin' touch
And fading away
We'll still be raising our cups
To the same damn things

Oh no, the city won't change us
Oh no, the city won't change us
Oh no, the city won't change us  (can't change us)
Oh no, the city won't change us
Won't change us

(Hey!) lala da da da-da da-da
Lala da da da-da da-da doe
And no matter where we go
We always find our way back home

Lala da da da-da da-da
Lala da da da-da da-da doe
(And no matter where we go
We always find our way back home

(Hey!) lala da da da-da da-da
Lala da da da-da da-da doe
(Hey!) and no matter where we go
We always find our way back home

(Hey!)
We always find our way back home
Yeah, we always find our way back home
