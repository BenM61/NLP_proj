Night people, oh, oh
People of the night

I wanna talk about the night people on the street
You can be sure that you're gonna meet
Night people out for a midnight dream
After the lights have gone down, yeah

Late at night there is a feeling of pure delight
That's when the night people meets their height
When all the lights have gone down, yeah, yeah

(Night people, oh, oh)
Are you one? Do you dance in the street
Just like the people of the night?
Yeah, you see they're dancing, romancing

(Do you know that night people, oh, oh)
Are you one? Do you dances like those?
(People of the night)
They will always be bound
When every night comes around

Mystery flows through the air
On a tempting breeze
Urging the night people loud and free
After the lights have gone down, yeah

Music plays up until morning, they all will stay
Night people dancing the night away
When all the lights have gone down, listen baby

(Night people, oh, oh)
Are you one? Do you dance in the street
Just like the people of the night?
Yeah, you see they're moving and grooving

(Do you know that night people, oh, oh)
Ooh baby
(People of the night)
Do you know that

I see you come alive, baby
In the starlight, every single night
Your face is like the moon that's shining
Makes me smile and feel alright

At midnight there's a love bite
Love is the feeling in the air

(Night people, oh, oh)
Yes I'm one, I like to have a lot of fun, yeah
(People of the night)
Moving and grooving with the night people
Every night

(Do you know that night people, oh, oh)
Did you know? You see them out on Broadway
(People of the night)
Dancing the night away, oh
