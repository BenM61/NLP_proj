A time for us some day there'll be 
When chains are torn by courage born 
Of a love that's free 
A time when dreams so long denied 
Can flourish as we unveil 
The love we now must hide 

*A time for us at last to see 
A life worthwhile for you and me 
And with our love through tears and thorns 
We will endure as we pass surely 
Through every storm 
A time for us someday there'll be 
A new world, a world of shining hope 
For you and me
