Hold me, hold me
Never let me go until you've told me, told me
What I want to know and then just hold me, hold me
Make me tell you I'm in love with you

Thrill me (thrill me), thrill me (thrill me)
Walk me down the lane where shadows will be (will be), will be (will be)
Hiding lovers just the same as we'll be, we'll be
When you make me tell you I love you

They told me "Be sensible with your new love"
"Don't be fooled, thinking this is the last you'll find"
But they never stood in the dark with you, love
When you take me in your arms and drive me slowly out of my mind

Kiss me (kiss me), kiss me (kiss me)
And when you do, I'll know that you will miss me (miss me), miss me (miss me)
If we ever say "Adieu", so kiss me, kiss me
Make me tell you I'm in love with you

(Kiss me) kiss me, (kiss me) kiss me
When you do, I'll know that you will miss me (miss me), miss me (miss me)
If we ever say "Adieu" so kiss me, kiss me
Make me tell you I'm in love with you

(Hold me, thrill me)
(Never, never, never let me go)
(Hold me, thrill me, never, never, never let me go)

(Hold me, thrill me, never, never, never let me go)
