I'll tell you a story and it's a true one and I'll tell it like you understand
And I ain't gonna talk like some history maid.

I look out and I see a land.
Young and lovely. Hard and strong
For fifty thousand years we've danced her praises.
Prayed our thanks and we've just begun. Yes, Yes

Yes this is my country.
Young and growing. 
Free and flowing. See to see. 
Yes, this is my country.
Ripe and bearing miracles 
in ever pond and tree.
Her spirit walks the high country.
She's giving free wild samples.
And setting an example how to give.

Yes this is my country
Retching and turning
She is like a baby learning how to live
i can stand upon a hill at dawn
Look all around me. 
Feel her surround me.
Soldier blue
Can't you see her life has just begun 
Beating inside us. Telling us she's here to guide us.

Soldier blue, Soldier blue, Soldier blue.
Can't you see that there's another way to love her.

This is my country
And I sprang from her
And I'm learning how to count upon her.
Tall trees and the corn is high country.
I guess I love her.
And I'm learning how to take care of her

When the news stories get me down
I take a drink of freedom to think of
North America from toe to crown
It's never long before
I know just why I belong here

Soldier Blue, Soldier Blue
Can't you see that there's another way to love her
