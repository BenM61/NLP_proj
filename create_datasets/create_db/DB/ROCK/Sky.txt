I woke dreaming we had broke
Dreaming you left me for someone new
And you cried, drying those brown eyes
Crying you're sorry, sorry won't do

But this is the way I need to wake
I wake to you
And you never left me
All that I dreamed had been untrue
Open my eyes
I see sky

Oh, oh, oh, oh, you know the way to keep me on my toes
I, I, I will be fine, just say you'll stay forever mine
Till we fall asleep tonight

Last night, we had a great fight
I fell asleep in a horrible state
Then dreamed that you loved my best friend
My heart would not mend, seemed it was fate

But this is the way I need to wake
I wake to you
And you never left me
All that I dreamed had been untrue
Open my eyes
I see sky

Oh, oh, oh, oh, you know the way to keep me on my toes
I, I, I will be fine, just say you'll stay forever mine
Till we fall asleep tonight

Sometimes I forget to love you like I should (Love you like I should)
But I'd never leave you, no, I never would
I never would

Oh, oh, oh, oh, you know the way to keep me on my toes
I, I, I will be fine, just say you'll stay forever mine
Oh, oh, oh, oh, you know the way to keep me on my toes
I, I, I will be fine, just say you'll stay forever mine
Till we fall asleep tonight
Till we fall asleep tonight
