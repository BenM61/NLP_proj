I awake
From blood thick dreams
Washing blame
From my knees

Softly done
So secretly
I'm awake
As Charlie sleeps

A lone brother, a lone sister
A home cover, alone

I awake
Dry the scream
Spit the vile breath
Till my tongue bleeds

Thinks it's all gone
Famously
Broke the hard girl
Good to please

A lone brother, a lone sister
A home cover, alone

Tell it like it is
Tell it like it is
Tell the sordid truth
Tell them
Tell it like it is
Tell them

A lone brother, a lone sister
A home cover, alone
Alone, alone, alone, alone, yeah
