[Chorus]
I saw her first in a beggar's game
Her eyes were wild but her laugh was tame.
Those people knew her by another name.
I knew that she'd be mine,
I knew that she'd be mine.

She took me in on a winter's night
The air was brittle and the moon was bright.
My heart was heavy but her touch was light.
Deep in the dance we wandered,
Deep in my heart she fell.

The candles glistened and the water gleamed.
She drew a bath and the windows steamed;
She looked like every woman ever dreamed,
In the heart of a lonely man,
In the heart of a lonely man.

She took my blindness and she led me through,
As night retreated and the daylight grew.
And with the first rays of the sun I knew,
Love had another captive,
Love had another fool.

[Chorus]

The spell is broken and the chains fall free.
Finally my heart has come home to me.
It seems I've waited an eternity.

She took me in on a winter's night,
The air was brittle and the moon was bright.
My heart was heavy but her touch was light.

Deep in the dance we wandered,
Deep in my heart she fell.
The candles glistened and the water gleamed.
She drew a bath and the windows steamed.
She looked like every woman ever dreamed,
In the heart of a lonely man,
In the heart of a lonely man.

[Chorus]
