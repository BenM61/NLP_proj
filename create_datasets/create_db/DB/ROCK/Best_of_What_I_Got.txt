Ow
Oh yeah 
If you want to put a message
Through my heart
Shoot the arrow in the morning hey
I'm gonna rise and shine
And wake you up
And move you without warning
Call my name

I understand the reason for desire
The band I give to you will be the ring of fire 
Something in your kiss that lasts forever
Burning in the heat for you
Love you 'round the clock
You get the best of what I got 
Oh yeah 

Gonna work all day to buy you pretty things
Cause you're such a pretty girl
You can work me overtime knock me out
Got my senses in a whirl
Like a locomotive burning down the track
You're my destination
One on one and kiss for kiss
You're my fascination 
Something in your touch that holds the promise hey
You've got me feeling all shook up
Love you 'round the clock
You get the best of what I got 
Oh yeah 

I put my key inside your door
And it feels so good 
When I come home at night
We're rocking the neighborhood
Rocking the neighborhood 
Something that you read about in headlines
I feel the heat for you

I wanna rock you 'round the clock
You get the best 
You get the best of what I got 
Oh yeah 
You get the best of what I got
Ow

I want to love you 'round the clock
(Best of what I got)
