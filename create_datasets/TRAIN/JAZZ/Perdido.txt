Perdido, I look for my heart it's perdido
I lost it way down in Torido
While chancing a dance fiesta
Bolero, he glanced as I danced the Bolero
He said taking off his sombrero: "Let's meet for a sweet fietsa"

High was the sun when we first came close
Low was the moon when we said adios

Perdido, since then has my heart been perdido
I know I must go to Torido, that yearning to lose perdido

I look for my heart it's perdido
I lost it way down in Torido
He glanced as I danced the Bolero
He smiled as he tipped his sombrero

High was the moon when we first came close
Low was the moon when we said adios

Since then has my heart been perdido
I must go to Torido, that yearning telude

Perdido oeoeoeoe Perdido oeoeoeoe Perdido
The day the fiesta started

Perdido oeoeoeoe Perdido oeoeoeoe Perdido
That's when my heart departed

It's perdido!
