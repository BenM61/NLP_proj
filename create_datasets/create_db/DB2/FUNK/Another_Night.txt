Uh
Check this out

All my friends have to ask if I'm shattered
I say the past is the past and it no longer matters
I've made my mind up, I can make it
I'll be fine even if I got to fake it
I'll keep survivin', ooh

Another night without you
Another night, I know I can get through
Another night, it's only
Another night, I won't be lonely

Another night
Another night
Another night, it ain't much
Another night without your touch

I used to search through the crowd to find you, huh
But I don't feel like it now, so don't look behind you, ooh
You better face it, I won't be callin'
I hit my stride when the evening is fallin'
I'm gonna make it, oh

Another night without you, hey
Another night, I know I can get through
Another night, it's only
Another night, I won't be lonely

Another night
Another night
Another night, it ain't much
Another night without your touch

And when the music is loud and the people are laughing
I'm gonna step on out, I won't be down
Gonna stand my ground for just
Another night
Oh, yes, I am
Another night

You were fazin' out, my sweet, and I knew it
You didn't give a damn how I got through it
But like you I have someone else too
Always there to keep me warm, no time for blue

I made my mind up, I can make it
I'll be fine even if I got to fake it
I'll keep survivin', yes, I will

Another night without you
Another night, I know I can get through
Another night, it ain't much
My man, I don't need you to keep bringin' me down, hey

Another night (without you)
Another night, (I know I can get through)
Another night, (it's only)
Another night, it's only
Another night, yeah, oh, yes, it is
(Another night)
(Another night)
I get so restless in my bed without you, boy
Oh, yes I do
(Another night)
Whoa and oh, I'm gonna make it now, yes, I am
You know that I am
(Another night)
There'll stand no talkin' at me, boy
No, no, no, no, no
