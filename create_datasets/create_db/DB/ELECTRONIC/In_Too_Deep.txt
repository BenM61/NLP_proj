Shadows hide, on the wall
We're done fighting, lost it all
I see you, and you see me
Losing sight, we're in to deep

We're in to deep
We're in to deep

Let it be
Let it be
Before it slips through
Too far to reach

Let it bee
Let it bee
Let the waves wash away the memories

We're in to deep
We're in to deep

Here with you, lost in time
Feel your heartbeat, next to mine
I feel you, and you feel me
Nothing left of, what used to be

We're in too deep
We're in too deep

I feel you, and you feel me
Nothing left of, what used to be
We're in too deep

We're in too deep
We're in too deep
We're in too deep
We're in too deep

We're in too deep
We're in too deep
We're in too deep
