I gave my heart to you, the one that I trusted
You brought it back to me all broken and busted
So I sold my heart to the junkman
And I'll never fall in love again

You took my heart because you thought you could use it
Just like a little toy you battered and bruised it
So I sold my heart to the junkman
And I'll never fall in love again

Like a melodrama, in a simple manner
Love played the leading part
We had planned a happy ending
Now I'm left with a broken heart

Ohhh, I'll throw away my pride and say we'll be friends, dear
Teardrops I just can't hide 'cause this is the end, dear
I sold my heart to the junkman
And I'll never fall in love again

No, I'll never fall in love again
