You should have treated me right
But you left me lonely and cold at night.
Since you won't, someone will
Treat me better and be for real.

If you didn't want it you should of let me know
But since you didn't want it, then girl you got to go.
You left me sad and lonely, and ran away from home
So since I'm not your only, then go and fetch your bone.

Dawg, dirty dawg, dawg, dirty dawg,
Dawg, ooh, you're a dirty, dirty,
Dawg, dirty dawg, dawg, dirty dawg,
Dawg, oh, you're sow damn dirty.

I gave you all that I can
Til I caught you swingin' with another man
But this time you strayed too far
Now you come beggin' like the dog you are.

If you didn't want it you should of let me know
But since you didn't want it, then girl you got to go.
Don't think that you can play me, and jerk me all around.
You used to be ma baby, now your ass is in the pound.

Dawg, dirty dawg, dawg, dirty dawg,
Dawg, ooh, you're a dirty, dirty,
Dawg, dirty dawg, dawg, dirty dawg,
Dawg, oh, you're sow damn dirty.

Yo, yo, why you want to act like a tramp, a wet food stamp,
I think it's time for me to break camp
Had a crush on my man the first time we met.
Now what you see is what you get
Lost more than a mil on a gambling bet
So here's the Chuck-wagon for the dog in you,
Here's the kennel ration and the Alpo too

Now you know I didn't want her
She tried to back me on a corner told her
Blow the horn like little Jack Horner
Forever forbidden, the fast girls in life
The fast cars they call'em kittens
They've been known to amaze
But they can't pull one over me
I got game for days
Save the sap rap for the handicapped
I've been around the block and I didn't
Fall for the trimmed trap.

Dawg, dirty dawg, dawg, dirty dawg,
Dawg, ooh, you're a dirty, dirty,
Dawg, dirty dawg, dawg, dirty dawg,
Dawg, oh, you're sow damn dirty.
