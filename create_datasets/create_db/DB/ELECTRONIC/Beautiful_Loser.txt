One last kiss before they cart me away and
Just take one last look before my body decays
This is my last night on earth
My fucking hell

All my life all I've wanted to say
This is love love love while the symphony plays
Here in death I would cut my breath just to stay

I'll never love again
Take the vision away

Beautiful beautiful
I'm a Loser alive
On a suicide mission to die
Beautiful beautiful
I'm a loser inside
Suicide
You're beautiful yeah
I'm a suicide

F*ck f*ck f*ck I wanna f*ck till we bleed and
There's a time crunch baby I don't want to believe
This is my last night on earth
My fucking hell
