All the colors of the rainbow
All the voices of the wind
Every dream that reaches out
That reaches out to find where love begins

Every word of every story
Every star in every sky
Every corner of creation
Lives to testify!

For as long as I shall live, I will testify to love
Be a witness in the silences when words are not enough
With every breath I take, will give thanks to God above
For as long as I shall live, I will testify to love

From the mountains to the valleys
From the rivers to the seas
Every hand that reaches out
Every hand that reaches out to offer peace

Every simple act of mercy,
Every step to kingdom come
All the hope in every heart will
Speak what love has done!

For as long as I shall live, I will testify to love
Be a witness in the silences when words are not enough
With every breath I take, will give thanks to God above
For as long as I shall live, I will testify to love
