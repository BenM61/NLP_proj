Oh, I just want you to know
No matter where you go
It doesn't matter
Cuz you're still in my heart

Thinkin' of you
Brings tears to my eyes
Seems yesterday
We were planning our lives
I'm so confused
Wonderin' why
How could you leave
Without sayin' goodbye
Picture you smile
Inside my head
Still smell your cologne
All over my bed
Miss you so much
I pray every night
That the angels
Are watchin' you
& trainin' you right

Oh, I just want you to know
No matter where you go
It doesn't matter
Cuz you're still in my heart

I sing to myself
So nobody hears
There's just no escape
In the sound of my tears
Miss you so much
& every night
I can't sleep
It ain't right
Memories keep holdin' me down
They're just no fun
When you're not around
Don't know what to do
Now I'm faced with the truth
Somehow I thought
That we would always be you & I

Oh, I just want you to know
No matter where you go
It doesn't matter
Cuz you're still in my heart
