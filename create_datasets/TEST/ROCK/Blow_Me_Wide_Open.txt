You've got a face to kill for
Another play, you even the score
Another nail, scratch the headboard
Do you remember me?
Well, that's it; move how you do
Another empty space that fills you
Another bone to chill through
Why do you wanna be
Forgettable and so replaceable?

I'm not ready to go
You've just started your show
And there's too many words we've left unspoken
Now that I've played your game
I won't be the same
I make my move and you blow me wide open
Blow me wide open

I've got no time to waste on this
Watch the smile fall from your lips
Another good one that you missed
Do you remember me?
Somehow, you're pulling me in
Hiding me under your skin
So many times I've been
I guess I'll always be
Forgettable and so invisible

I'm not ready to go
You've just started your show
And there's too many words we've left unspoken
Now that I've played your game
I won't be the same
I make my move and you blow me wide open

No matter what you do
Something is watching you
It used to be something new
But I'm getting used to it
And you blow me wide open

I'm not ready to go
You've just started your show
And there's too many words we've left unspoken
Now that I've played your game
I won't be the same
I make my move and you blow me wide open
Blow me wide open
And you blow me wide open
