Yeah yeah yeah...
I hate myself when going
yeah, yeah, yeah...

Hear me, I sound like a Beatle
I get cold feet when the pressure's on
you can't see me, coz I'm lost like a needle
In a haystack yeah I'm almost gone
Like a mouse follows the flute
Or like a mule who can't dispute I fall in line with you

Mouse more than man yes I am
You know I want to say no and just stick to my own plan
Mouse more than man, yes I am
Coz yet I go with the flow

See me a a chameleon,  a cheap shot
I change my cast for anybody's best
But I'm not free, I feel more like a robot
That is programmed to please the rest
So whatever you want I'll do
Whenever you want me to, I will agree with you

Mouse more than man yes I am
You know I want to say no and just stick to my own plan
Mouse more than man, yes I am
Coz yet I go with the flow

Yeah yeah yeah...
I hate myself when going
yeah, yeah, yeah...

No more sound like a Beatle
Those cold feet are for yesterday
No more getting the needle
I cannot care about what others say

Mouse more than man yes I am
You know I want to say no and just stick to my own plan
Mouse more than man, yes I am
Coz yet I go with the flow before the shit hits the fan

yeah yeah yeah yeah...
this is my last time going
yeah yeah yeah...
