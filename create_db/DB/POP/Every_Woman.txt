Like the fallin' tear drop
You can wipe away my blues
Like honey you can make the bitter sweet
Your a child a girl a women
You are anything I choose
That's why I sing this song to you

'Cause you are every women in the world to me
Just like the seasons I go thru
You are every women in the world to me
Especially When I'm making love to you

'Cause you are every women in the world to me
Just like the seasons I go thru
You are every women in the world to me
Especially When I'm making love to you

Like the fallin' tear drop
You can wipe away my blues
Like honey you can make the bitter sweet
Your a child a girl a women
You are anything I choose
That's why I sing this song to you
And that's why I sing this song of love to you
