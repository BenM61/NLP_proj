With a purposeful grimace and a terrible sound
He pulls the spitting high tension wires down
Helpless people on a subway train

Scream bug-eyed as he looks in on them
He picks up a camero and he throws it back down
As he wades through the buildings toward the center of town

Oh no, they say he's got to go go go godzilla
Oh no, there goes tokyo go go godzilla

History shows again and again
How nature points up the folly of men
