Up
from the mud
one seed
four seasons,
just because is good enough
of a reason
every pain you've ever known
was coaxing diamonds out of coal
have no fear at all
you have a soul, it can't be owned,
take the heat
take control
you're free
that's the only way to be
up
from the dust
one heart
ten fingers
just because is good enough,
it's the only reason-
every pain you've ever known
was coaxing diamonds out of coal
have no fear at all
you have a soul, it can't be owned,
take the heat
take control
you're free
that's
the only way to be
