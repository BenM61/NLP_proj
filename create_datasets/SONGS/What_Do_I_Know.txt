You were once my vice
Now you're just like ice
So cold and too cool
You know how to hypnotize
You wear a great disguise
I've learned to see through

What do I know
What do I know
I'm confused by things that you do
What do I know
What do I know
I can't stop thinking about you

I don't see wrong from right
But I could see the light
Stopped shining in you
And on a distant night
You went and lost the fight
That made me look up to you

What do I know
What do I know
I'm confused by things that you do
What do I know
What do I know
I can't stop thinking about you

What do I know
What do I know
I'm confused by things that you do
What do I know
What do I know
I can't stop thinking about you

What did you change for

What do I know
What do I know
I'm confused by things that you do
What do I know
What do I know
I can't stop thinking about you

What did you change for
No one could give you more
What did you change for
No one could give you more

What do I know
What do I know
I'm confused by things that you do
What do I know
What do I know
I can't stop thinking about you
