Well, we're in the thick of it
Better get a grip and get it on, get it on

We're in the thick of it
Better get a grip and get it on
Better get a grip and get it on
Better get a grip and get it on
Get it on, get it on

The world we live in is so hectic
Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it
So hold on tight and we'll just make it
It's such a dog-gone fight
But we won't know until we try

We're in the thick of it
Better get a grip and get it on
Better get a grip and get it on
Better get a grip and get it on
Get it on, get it on

Sometimes I think I'm going somewhere
But then I look around and who's there
It makes you wonder what's important
Is it really do or die to see if you can touch the sky?

We're in the thick of it
Better get a grip and get it on
Better get a grip and get it on
Better get a grip and get it on
Get it on, get it on

So hold on tight and we can make it
So hold on tight and we can make it
Get it on, get it on, get it on
