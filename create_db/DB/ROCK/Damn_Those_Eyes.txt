Damn those eyes,
They keep me torn inside.
She runs like a river through me,
Always you. 

Eyes don't lie, words may try.
She comes like a mystery, flows through me,
And I swear it's true,
Always you.

I wish I could run in to you now, ey yeah 
I wish I could run in to you now
If I see you one more time, 
Maybe I'd feel better, ey yeah
If I'd see you one more time,
Maybe I'd feel not so cold. 

Damn those eyes,
No matter how I try,
She reigns with her symphony, over me.
Words may try
I said
Eyes don't lie,
She speaks with her tender voice, 
'till there's no choice,
And I swear it's true, always you.

Eh yeah eh yeah
I wish I could run in to you now, ey yeah
I wish I could run in to you now
If I see you one more time, maybe I'd feel better,
If I'd see you one more time,
Maybe I'd feel better 

Eh yeh Oh ey yeah eh eh yeah
Eh yeah yeah, better

Oh oh oh yeah yeah

See you one more time
Hold you one more time
Baby yeah 
Baby baby yeah 
Baby baby
See you want you
O yeah maybe I'd feel better
If I'd see you one more time
Maybe I'd feel better
If I'd see you one more time
Maybe I'd feel.
Maybe I'd feel a whole lot better
