Set this place on fire
Send you spirit, savior
Rescue me from the mire
Show your servant favor

Yesterday was the day that I was alone
Now I'm in the presence of almighty god

And yes our God, he is a consuming fire
And the flames burn down deep in my soul
Yes, our God, he is a consuming fire
He reaches inside and he melts down this cold heart of stone

Set this place on fire
Send your spirit, savior
Rescue me from the mire
Show your servant favor

Yesterday was the day that I was alone
Now I'm in the presence of almighty god

Did you realize that inside of you there is a flame?
Did you ever try to let it burn, let it burn, let it burn
