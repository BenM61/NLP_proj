Dont mess with my Toot Toot
Dont mess with my Toot Toot
I know you have another woman
So dont mess with my Toot Toot

When I was born in my birth suit
The doctor slap her behind
He said: Youre gonna be special
You sweet little Toot Toot?

So you can look as much
But if you much as touch
Youre gonna have yourself a case
Im gonna break your face

So dont mess with my Toot Toot
Dont mess with my Toot Toot
I know you have another woman
So dont mess with my Toot Toot

Dont mess with my Toot Toot
Dont mess with my Toot Toot
I know you have another woman
So dont mess with my Toot Toot

Toot Toot
Toot Toot
I know you have another woman
Toot Toot

Toot Toot
Toot Toot
I know you have another woman
Toot Toot

Dont mess with my Toot Toot
Dont mess with my Toot Toot
I know you have another woman
So dont mess with my Toot Toot
