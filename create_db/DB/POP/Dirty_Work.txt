Rolling my sleeves up in here
To make you smile ear to ear
Girl I been hitting that, hitting that graveyard shift
You won't find another one built for this
Dirty work, ooh
Dirty work
Baby I don't need your help
I'd do it all by myself
Girl I been putting in, putting in over time
You ain't gotta tell me what's on your mind

Dirty work, ooh
Dirty work
'Cause when you do what you love
You're gonna love what you do
You know I do it with love
Each night I do it for you

It's the dirty work
Somebodies gotta do it
Dirty work
So we're getting into it
Dirty work
Go and get your body moving
You know it ain't no nine to five
We're going sundown to sunrise
Dirty work
Dirty work

I'm filthy down to the core
Leave all your stress at the door
You know you need to stop scrubbing with Mr. Clean
Bring it right here, come next to me

Dirty work, ooh
Dirty work
'Cause when you do what you love
You're gonna love what you do
You know I do it with love
Each night I do it for you

It's the dirty work
Somebodies gotta do it
Dirty work
So we're getting into it
Dirty work
Go and get your body moving
You know it ain't no nine to five
We're going sundown to sunrise
Dirty work
Dirty work

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Dirty work
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Dirty work
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

'Cause when you do what you love
You're gonna love what you do
You know I do it with love
Every time I'm with you

It's the dirty work
Somebodies gotta do it
Dirty work
So we're getting into it
Dirty work
Go and get your body moving
You know it ain't no nine to five
We're going sundown to sunrise
Dirty work
