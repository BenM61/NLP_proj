1,2,3,4 Celice
It's in the way you hurt me
Celice I know that I'm alive

Open up inside
Make me want you
Make me want to
Wrap yourself around me
Hold me tighter
Hold me tight as only you can

Celice 
It's in the way you hurt me
Celice 
You sharpened up my senses
I know you're on my side

Celice
Its in the way you teach me
Celice
To chase the thoughts away

You open up my eyes
Made me want you
Made me want to
You know it feels so nice
Hold me tight now
Hold me tight as can be

Celice
It's in the way you hurt me
Celice
Its in the way you hurt me
(Oh hold me tightly)
Celice
I know that I'm alive 
(hold me hold me tightly)
Celice
You sharpened all my senses
I know you're on my side
