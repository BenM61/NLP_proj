So few words
So few words

We are movin' round to the hour
Force from the power
Thunder reigns down in a mass mind shower
Levellin' vibes unravellin' scribes
Take a venomous sting that's unsettlin'

But consequences awaits me around the corner
Reminiscent of my twistin' fate
All down to the fact it's a hard life
Travel on with the sense of a telling adventure
So as I wait for the opportune time to create

Soul energy that will then enable me to realize
Analyze all aspect of man-made decision
The vision the many ways
Wrong turn right, right turn left
Ain't no way back straight ahead along track

Counteract react higher pace embrace
Expression when written on the face
Ya babblin' on flip automatic override
So when pride gets swallowed
Check the events that follow

Interconnection bafflin' coincidence
All going hand in hand
They demand supply I deliver my peace
In what can be known as my only release
In the belly-full beast tearin' up
And it's a cryin' shame it remains the same
Turn the next page over

So few words
So few words

Then on straight down
Through the valley I roam
Lay claim my terrain through my artery vein
But first intuition state my in condition is the reason
Why you'll never get my submission

True as I'm present in time
I'm headin' for the future
Movin' with a haste from time to waste
Break loose from a goose chase
What I do I take feathers and fly in spiritual sky

Return to ground zero zero
Now for the intrepid hero
Non-sense there will be no
I overrun 'cause unless I'm in a situation
I can learn a lesson in

One specimen away say a line refine
Humanity race ever being like one of a kind
Now we can never rewind so press
Forward to the end
With the passionate fruit from mother nature

So few words
