Let me save thee, save thee from the den of iniquity 
Let me save thee, we're repeating Roman history
Let me save thee, we're repeating Roman history
On the streets where kicks are our beat 
It's a tortured way of livin' 
It's not a new bag, letting your conscience sag 
The Romans did it 
But I'll give you moon love, old fashioned moon love 
Like initials on a tree, saying that you love me 

Back to the days of the Romans, baby 
(That's where we're goin') that's where we're goin' 
Sing hallelujah, sing hallelujah 

Let me save thee from walkin' the path of least resistance 
Let me save thee, baby don't laugh at the devil's existence 
Things were fine, we were havin' a time 
When Caesar lost his handle 
A free-for-all, we were havin' a ball 
Wine, women and scandal 
But I'll give you moon love, old fashioned moon love 
Like initials on a tree, saying that you love me 

Moonlight, old-fashioned moonlight 
Moonlight, old-fashioned moonlight
