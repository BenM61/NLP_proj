You say you feel so down
Every time I turn around
And you say you should've been gone by now
And you, you think that everything's wrong
You ask me how to carry on
We'll make it through another day just hold on.

'Cause life starts now.
You've done all the things that could kill you somehow
And you're so far down
But you will survive it somehow because life starts now.

I hate to see you fall down
I'll pick you up off of the ground
I've watched the weight of your world come down
And now it's your chance to move on
Change the way you've lived for so long
You find the strength you've had inside all along.

'Cause life starts now.
You've done all the things that could kill you somehow
And you're so far down
But you will survive it somehow because life starts now.

All this pain
Take this life and make it yours.
All this hate
Take your heart and let it love again.
You will survive this somehow.

Life starts now.
You've done all the things that could kill you somehow,
And you're so far down.
Life starts now.
You've done all the things that could kill you somehow,
And you're so far down.
Life starts now.
