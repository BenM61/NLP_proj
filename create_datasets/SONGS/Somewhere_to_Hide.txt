Some might follow us,
We're on the run tonight so light the fuse
Hold me close, too young to lose
Just like a dream,
Running against the wind with no regrets.
Leave behind our innocence.

Well he said listen, listen,
I'm not afraid to go if it's with you
I was born to live for you.
And I'm like Juliet, waiting to see the sunset, on the rise
No goodbyes, I'd rather die.

So let's dance across the line, say your love is mine

We'll find somewhere to hide,
We'll stay out of sight
Until we know everything is alright
Baby just keep searching
You're safe, don't worry.
We'll find somewhere to hide.

King and queen now,
We'll climb the highest peak and call it ours
Paint the sky and burn the stars
Lift me off the ground
We can spin around til we collapse
Burn the maps, stay where we're at

So let's dance across the line, say your love is mine

We'll find somewhere to hide,
We'll stay out of sight
Until we know everything is alright
Baby just keep searching,
You're safe, don't worry.
We'll find somewhere to hide.

We'll find somewhere to hide,
We'll stay out of sight
Until we know everything is alright
Baby, just keep searching,
You're safe, don't worry.
We'll find somewhere to hide.
We'll find somewhere to hide.
We'll find somewhere to hide.

(You hear me, crying)
Hey hey hey!

We'll find somewhere to hide
We'll stay out of sight
Until we know everything is alright
Baby just keep searching
You're safe, don't worry.
We'll find somewhere to hide.

We'll find somewhere to hide
We'll stay out of sight
Until we know everything is alright
Baby just keep searching
You're safe, don't worry.
We'll find somewhere to hide
We'll find somewhere to hide
We'll find somewhere to hide
