I've been feeling real good, came a long way from misunderstood
Far away from the days where I wouldn't wanna go home 'cause I was afraid of the truth
See I was scared to admit that failing was in the back of my head
Comes a point when lying no longer works so you have to stand up for how you want to live

Tonight is the night is the night that were losing control (whoa whoa)
Tonight is the night is the night we set it off

Everybody go, whoa whoa ooh ooh ooh, whoa whoa ooh ooh ooh
Yea yea yea yea
Everybody go, whoa whoa ooh ooh ooh, whoa whoa ooh ooh ooh
Yea yea yea yea

And I don't know better but as far as I came it felt like forever,
Seconds turn to hours days turn to months another year pass by but don't feel like much
So if I got one chance, motherfucker I'ma make yall dance
I'ma have as much fun as I can and figure out the rest when I etch out a plan

Tonight is the night is the night that were losing control (whoa whoa)
Tonight is the night is the night we set it off

Everybody go, whoa whoa ooh ooh ooh, whoa whoa ooh ooh ooh
Yea yea yea yea
Everybody go, whoa whoa ooh ooh ooh, whoa whoa ooh ooh ooh
Yea yea yea yea

I'm feelin' better than I ever thought, it's possible but now I know yeah
I'm feelin' better than I ever did, impossible don't exist no, impossible don't exist

Everybody go, whoa whoa ooh ooh ooh, whoa whoa ooh ooh ooh
Yea yea yea yea
Everybody go, whoa whoa ooh ooh ooh, whoa whoa ooh ooh ooh
Yea yea yea yea

Tonight is the night is the night that were losing control
Tonight is the night is the night we set it off

Tonight is the night is the night that were losing control
Tonight is the night is the night we set it off
