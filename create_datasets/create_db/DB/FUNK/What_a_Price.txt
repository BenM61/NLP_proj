Oh what a price I had to pay
For loving you, you, you

I bought a house, a diamond ring
I had to give up everything
Oh what a price I had to pay
For loving you, you, you

I  stopped my rambling, I even stopped gambling
And I stopped staying out all night
Oh what a price I had to pay
For loving you, you, you

I tried so hard to do what's right
But you only wrecked my life
Oh what a price I had to pay
For loving you, you, you

You've heard my story. I've sung my song
So, goodbye baby, I'm gone
Oh what a price I had to pay
For loving you, you, you
