Bring the heat
The heat
Doing all that I can for you
To be a woman and man,
So I can treat you better

No I, I can't feel the heat
Yet don't let it catch you,
No, I, I can't feel the heat
I know I can't get you home

No, I can't finish my workout
I knew that the moment I run, honey
Won't help it make you better
Still I I can't feel the heat
Yeah, don't let it catch you
Don't, I I can't feel the heat
I know I can't get you home, no

(Keep together, stand on together)
I know I can't get you home
(Keep together, stand on together)
I know I can't get you home
No I, I can't feel the heat
Yeah,
I know I can't get you home
No I, I can't feel the heat
No, doing all that I can for you
To be a woman and man, honey
So I can treat you better
