We will try to waste them
So you can try to feel 'em
It's all in the name of hell
We got to fear it with a good sensation
It's easy come and go

We want something
Everyone wants something
Everyone's got to believe
We take you to it, nothing else to do
But live the life, it's all a lie

We burn the flags, burn the house
Burn the church, just burn it all down

We burn the streets, burn the trees
Burn the lessons, burn it all down
We burn the flags, burn the house
Burn the church, just burn it all down

We burn the signs, burn the saints
Burn the sinners
Burn the whole thing down, down, down
Burn it all down

We pay with riches
We took the stitches out of our wounded eyes
Install the masses with cynical retraction
They know your coded lies

We can't function, no one here can function
No one can even speak
I hear the bombs, a million shiny bombs
I close my eyes

I'll bring the bread, you'll bring the wine
This party's over, one last time
Burn it all down
