I had to strain to understand
Your swimming in the water tower
Running blood down from my hand
She said are you sure that you live
The way you want to live
I had to hope to take her hand
I was hanging on the edge for hours
Dreaming of some starry strand
And I was dreaming about your face
Running back my way

We were the picture of love
And love doesn't think of tomorrow
And long live romance from above
And your fire of love

I built a fire into the sky
A little something to remember you by
And panic broke and I lost my faith
And I was mistaken for you
On the palace stool

We were the picture of love
And love doesn't think of tomorrow
And long live romance from above
And your fire of love
We were the picture of love
And love doesn't think of forever
And long live your stars from above
And your fire of love

I had to strain to understand
Your swimming in the water tower

We were the picture of love
And love doesn't think of tomorrow
And long live romance from above
And your fire of love
We were the picture of love
And love doesn't think past forever
And long live you stars from above
And your fire of love
And your fire of love

And she said are you sure that you live
The way you want to live
