I'm torn between myself and Your truth
These cursed memories, forever seeping through
Oh, my thirst for myself left me wanting more
Till I found myself face down on Your shore

You say
Come to the river
Oh and lay yourself down
Let your heart be found
You say come to the river
Drink from the cup I pour
And thirst no more

My restless heart, oh led me astray
To my selfish pride, I became my own slave
But you placed a thirst in me, with no drink in sight
Cause I could not see, till I saw through Your eyes

You say
Come to the river
Oh and lay yourself down
Let your heart be found
You say come to the river
Drink from the cup I pour
And thirst no more

You say
Come to the river
Oh and lay yourself down
Let your heart be found

You say
Come to the river
Oh and lay yourself down
Let your heart be found
You say come to the river
Drink from the cup I pour
And thirst no more

You say come to the river
And thirst no more
You say come to the river
And thirst no more
