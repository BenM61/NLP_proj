Evening shadows make me blue
When each weary day is through
How I long to be with you, my happiness

Every day I reminisce
Dreaming of your tender kiss
Always thinking how I miss my happiness

A million years it seems
Have gone by since we shared our dreams
But I'll hold you again
There'll be no blue memories then

Whether skies are gray or blue
Any place on earth will do
Just as long as I'm with you, my happiness

Whether skies are gray or blue
Any place on earth will do
Just as long as I'm with you, my happiness
