In the corner of a bar a fat man sweats with a fistful of Dirty Dollars
Well he pushed so far when he tried to bet like Newman in the Hustler.

There's a baby blonde with cool blue eyes she wants to be Monroe
For fame she longs that shining prize to be the star of a movie show.

All that jazz, that Hollywood jazz
Keeps them moving on
All that jazz, that Hollywood jazz.

By a pinball machine a young man runs his fingers through his hair
On the silver screen he's seen James Dean fame he wants to share.

There's a chorus girl works night and day she slaves to learn her trade
She'd give the world, kneel down and pray, to be the star of a broadway stage.

All that jazz, that Hollywood jazz
Keeps them moving on
All that jazz, that Hollywood jazz

They just float around in that tinseltown
Ride the breeze that may blow to stardom
Famous party nites was my smile alright
Shake those hands that may guide their fortune
There in the game where the strongest will survive
The weak fall by the wayside

All that jazz, that Hollywood jazz
Keeps them moving on
Keeps them moving on
