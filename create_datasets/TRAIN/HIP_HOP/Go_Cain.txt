(darling,
I see you
I'm alright, now)

Go cain
Day after day
I know that you're the one who's gonna win
So go cain

Ready for the fight
The time is not right
Ready after all this years
For the love you didn't get
So go cain

You take from all around the things you really want
With cruelty from enemies, never mind

Go cain
The fear was there always since you were a child

Go cain
This time without compassion
No one understands
So go ahead

This is enough to give
This is enough to kill
This is enough to keep on going
Enough to keep on going
This is enough to give
This is enough to kill
This is enough to keep on going
Enough to keep on going

Go cain
Hate is gonna make you stronger
But it could finish you
But go cain

Go cain
Enough to keep going
Enough to keep going
Going ahead

You know
Sometimes
You go ahead
You go ahead
With all this faith that is growing
All this faith is growing fast
All this faith, you had it before
Had it before, before

Cold, so much cold
So much i loved before
Not before
And love, so much i love
So much i love

Ready for the fight
The time is not right
Ready after all this years
For the love you didn't get
So go cain

This is enough to give
This is enough to kill
Enough to keep going
Enough to keep going
This is enough to give
This is enough to kill
This is enough to keep going
Enough to keep going

You know
Sometimes
You go ahead
You go ahead
With all this faith that is growing
All this faith is growing fast
All this faith, you had it before
Had it before, before

Go cain, go cain, go cain...

Cold, so much cold
So much i loved before
Not before
And love, so much i love
So much i love
