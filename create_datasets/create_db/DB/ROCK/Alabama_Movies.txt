I got my attention span from Alabama movies
I got this little wrist band from correctional juvy
While we are young, while we are young
And we were robbed and this was fun

Smoke, I'm the water
Don't tell your doctor
We pray, said the liars
I'm dead, we look tired

Unless it's in the rain
Unless it's in the rain

I saw my very first bail
Was brunch, going insane
I lost my head and cane
Was sane through the membrane

While we are young, while we are young
And we were robbed and this was fun

Smoke, I'm the water
Don't tell your doctor
We pray, said the liars
I'm dead, we look tired

Unless it's in the rain
Unless it's in the rain

And don't leave me alone
You know that I think your door hurt
And why you think I'm blind
I can see that you're obviously annoying
And this is my bed, this is my house, this is my courtyard
And don't give me that look, you know I don't like that
