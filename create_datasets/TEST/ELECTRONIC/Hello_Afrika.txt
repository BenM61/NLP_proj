Yo! My name is Dr. Alban, the MD, microphone doctor
This song is dedicated to the people of Africa
Swe Mix gimme some drums
Yo! African people, unite
Come together for the sake of your future
Yo! African people unite

Hello Africa! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Motherland! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Africa! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Motherland! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Africa! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Motherland! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Africa! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Motherland! Tell me how you're doin'

Hello Nigeria! That's my Motherland
Coming to Sweden now causin' a hysteria
Takes a long time to travel the globe, so why be shy?
Why be humble? I just came straight out the jungle
You can't compete with me 'cause you know I got the rhythm

I did it before and I'll do it again, so listen watcha say
Yeah hear my point of view
Not everyone can do this
In fact only a few sophisticated, hardcreated
That's who I am, and you knowI've been waiting
So start pumping make some noise

The Mandika tribe, the Hausa tribe
The Fulani tribe, the Gooya tribe, the Zulu tribe
Mi no live in a house mi live in a tree
Electricity can give you a shock
Mi no smoke no cig mi no take no coke
All me take is a glass of juice

Hello Africa! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Motherland! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Africa! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Motherland! Tell me how you're doin'

I'm calling on the big guys from the pyramid top
To join the bits and pieces of our Fatherland Africa
'Cause without boundaries we can move the mountains
Drop your personal individual ambitions
Chase the devil off and purify our Fatherland

Afrikan people, crawl from your vultures
Stand affirm 'cause you are the aura of the mankind
You are the dreams, you are the hope, you are the future
You are the past, you are the grandfather of civilization
That is why A N see wants old dogs to sit

The impossible just takes a little longer
Out of this world and inta another world
The earth is spinning round and there's so much to discover
The African man seems to be everywhere
If there are people in the world
Who knows that right is never wrong
Stop the fire burning in my home Africa

Martin Luther King, Mandela you had a dream
Self evidence and a quality for men
Africa for me and Africa far you de Klerk
It doesn't really matter whether a cat is black or white
What really matter is to catch the mouse
I'd rather do it in an African way
Hello Africa tell me you you're doin'

Mmm, jumping on the mike, it 'cause me a rockin' up affection
When I'm holdin' me a mike, it 'cause me awesome affections
What you say to me, me a fun and me warm
Spend some me a time on the Tresittia dime
Don't you try to follow me you ought to realize what me are
What me a really want, me not fly
No I am just coolin', come on now just set it off

Hello Africa! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Motherland! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Africa! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Motherland! Tell me how you're doin'

I have been mourning, I have been grieving
I have been crying, no more tears in my eyes
There's a hottie, hottie wind blowing south to north
Following my head, drying all my plants
If there's a mercy in the clouds
You know right is never wrong

Move the sadist off my back
And stop the fire burning in my home Africa
Here comes the news from the mighty Lord
Transqualation is about to come to Earth
Right, rapping is digging down river, north to south
To let milk and honey flow side to side

My name is Alban, mi is a dentist, mi DJ here, mi DJ there
Mi have a shop on Slojdgatan, Alphabet St. is da name
Mi live in no house, mi live in a flat. electricity can give you a shock
Mi smoke no cig, mi take no coke, all me takes is a glass of juice

Hello Africa! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Motherland! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Africa! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Motherland! Tell me how you're doin'
