Who Cares (For Me)

I walked down this old lonely street
No one seen to wanna speak 
Ooh who cares yes who cares 
For poor poor me
All the world seem cold
Everything is gray
Nothin' seems the same
Since you went away
Ooh who cares yes who cares for me
Surely happiness can be found
Surely someone for me
Must I go Through life
With this hopeless love
Oh why can't I be set free 
All I want is you 
All I know is you
But somehow our
Love Just can't be
Ooh who cares yes who cares for me

Surely happiness can be found
Surely someone for me
Must I go through life
With this hopeless love
Ooh why can't I be set free 
All I wont is you 
All I know is you
But somehow our  
Love just can't be
Ooh who cares yes who cares for me
I'm gonna leave
I'm gonna leave this town
I'm goin' to the river
Jump overboard and drown ooh
