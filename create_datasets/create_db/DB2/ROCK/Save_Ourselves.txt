What a Shame, breaking Down
What is getting the best of you
Take a breath'm it's not complex
I'm going to put your mind at ease
Innocent People are not meant to suffer
We're making negative energy power

This will be Our Truth
Can you feel us, we're stronger
We Pray on the Weak and conquer
No Longer care for those,
Who try to condemn and Oppose

We'll save Ourselves
You're afraid that I'm right,
I know it eats you up inside
Well listen to me and you will see
You have to let those fears fly free
The only danger in the world is to be
Weak minded with insecurities

This won't be our truth
Can you feel us, we're stronger
We Pray on the Weak and conquer
No Longer care for those,
Who try to condemn and Oppose
We'll save Ourselves

Why do you fear everyone of us
Why do you hate everyone of us, you crush us
Why do we feel we are wasting our time
Go away, end this now

You need to get down off this cloud
Start focusing and Listening

And feel it's the time to change things
When I'm alone, I don't feel hopeless at all
The day must come where we can stand tall
And this will be our truth

Can you feel us, we're stronger
We Pray on the Weak and conquer
No Longer care for those,
Who try to condemn and Oppose
We'll save Ourselves
