It was part of our experiment
Went you said go and I went
Like a gooseberry on Noah's ark

I watched them file in two by two
And I set sail without you
And we were carried on the flood of your tears

Time pulls a face when I'm next to you
Let's hope the wind changes
Time pulled a face when I'm next to you
Let's hope the wind changes

Now I'm looking for dry land
As all this crying subsides
But I'm like Columbus in India

I'm a little all over the shop
Like those souvenirs from Knock
That come all the way from China

Time pulls a face when I'm next to you
Let's hope the wind changes
Time pulled a face when I'm next to you
Let's hope the wind changes

'cause we'd be stuck in this place
For an age or two
I hope the wind changes
And the vacuum in space will draw me to you
I hope the wind changes

I'm not over you, can I get back under
