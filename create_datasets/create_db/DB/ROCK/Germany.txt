Well I thought
That I meant something to you
But now I see that it's untrue

I guess you must have slept
With every guy you ever met
But I'm gonna get you back
If its the last thing I ever do

The stains on your mattress cannot hide
The fruits of your labor stuffed inside
But, while your in la-la land
Whispering the name of another man
I'm gonna turn my back
And leave your cheating ass behind

I'm gonna run away with your money
And buy a ticket to Germany
I'm gonna sleep with every single slut on the River Bohn
And I'll be surfing down the River Rhine (Whoo--oo--ooo)
And you'll be standing in the Welfare line
You're money and you're honey
Are long gone!

It's nothing personal
You saw to that
You're just a person
Who does her best work on her back

But if you're 'wakend
By an obscene call
I sprayed your number on the Berlin wall
I've seen the soldiers as they pass it all around

Imagine all the dick that you once missed
Because you couldn't find the Communists
East or West
Your still the best deal in town

Go!

I'm gonna run away with your money
And buy a ticket to Germany
I'm gonna sleep with every single slut on the River Bohn
And I'll be surfing down the River Rhine (Whoo--oo--ooo)
And you'll be standing in the Welfare line
You're money and you're honey
Are long gone!

You're money and you're honey
Are long gone!

You're money and you're honey
Are long gone!
