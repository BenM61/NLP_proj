I know the girls grow up fast where you come from
You left behind what was asked and you were married baby oh so young
Now that little girl of yours looks like she's growing up over night

Do you miss the party lights?
Do you miss the party lights?
Do you miss the party lights?
When you're lying in bed tonight

He was gonna be your Romeo, you were going to be his Juliet
These days you don't wait on Romeos you just wait on that welfare check
While other girls your age are out with lovers taken in the night

Do you miss the party lights?
Do you miss the party lights?
Do you miss the party lights?
When you're lying in bed tonight

Sometimes I see you on the street and you look so tired
I know that job you've got leaves you so uninspired
when I stop by to take you out to eat
I find you lying, all dressed up on the bed, baby, fast asleep

Then as I lean across the bed, darlin, to switch out the light
I wonder if you miss the party lights

Do you miss the party lights?
Do you miss the party lights?
When you're lying in bed tonight

Grab your coat and grab your hat go in the bathroom put that makeup on
We're gonna take that little brat, we're gonna drop her off at your mom's
Just give me a sign, I'm waiting on the line tonight
If you miss the party lights
If you miss the party lights
If you miss the party lights
When you're lying in bed tonight

Do you miss the party lights
When you're lying in bed tonight

Do you miss the party lights? (do you miss the party lights?)
Do you miss the party lights? (do you miss the party lights?)
Do you miss the party lights? (do you miss the party lights?)
Do you miss the party lights? (do you miss the party lights?)
Do you miss the party lights? (do you miss the party lights?)
Do you miss the party lights? (do you miss the party lights?)
Do you miss the party lights? (do you miss the party lights?)
