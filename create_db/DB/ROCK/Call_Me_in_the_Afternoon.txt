You can have it if you don't mind some or all others stay with me
You confuse me with your riddles and sudden generosity
Call me in the afternoon even by one by one
Call me in the afternoon even by one by one
You can have it when you come by
You can have yourself a one man way
And I saw you when I caught your eye
And its such a petty price to pay
Call me in the afternoon even by one by one
Call me in the afternoon even by one by one
Take one if you need it but you shouldn't be out this late
Really want to make you feel home
Take one if you need it but you shouldn't get this fucked up
Really wanna get it to you
Slide another shot by and wipe your dirty hands on me
Swallow til you go blind and find a little company
Call me in the afternoon even by one by one
Call me in the afternoon even by one by one
Take one if you need it but you shouldn't be out this late
Really wanna make you feel home
Take one if you need it but you shouldn't get this fucked up
Really wanna get it to you
After all, when I listen, it could be you
Could be anyone I want and I want you
