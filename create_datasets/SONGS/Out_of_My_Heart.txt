I feel fine 
Now the rain has gone and the sun has come to shine
Nothing can get me down today
Head over heels 
Got my mind made up as I'm driving through the fields
Nothing can get me down again
Catch me if you can
I've gotta make a getaway

As the sun goes down
Waking up my dreams
And in my mind you're with me once again
Out of my heart into your head
And inside my heart there's a place for you
And in my mind I'm with you once again
Out of my heart into your head

Chasing the sun
Trying to get away from the rain that's gonna come
Hope I make it all the way
I'm lost in a crowd
Trying to find my way but the rain keeps falling down
Doesn't matter anyway
Catch me if you can
I've gotta make a getaway

As the sun goes down
Waking up my dreams
And in my mind you're with me once again
Out of my heart into your head
And inside my heart there's a place for you
And in my mind I'm with you once again
Out of my heart into your head

Take a look at the sky, feel the sunshine 
In your heart, in your head, in your own time
As the sun goes down waking up my dreams
And in my mind you're with me once again
Out of my heart into your head
And inside my heart there's a place for you
And in my mind I'm with you once again
Out of my heart into your head

Out of my heart into your head

Out of my heart into your head
