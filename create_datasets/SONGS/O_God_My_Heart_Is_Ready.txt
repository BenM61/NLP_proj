God my heart is ready now
God my heart is ready now
I been awake so long
December dragging on

God my heart is ready now
And with the ease she came
Epiphany bleeds like rain
A season of seed, come again, oh yeah

All roads lead back on into town
Our graves shall lace the hollow ground
And when she call I come
And when she bleed I belong
Gone to seed, summer long, summer long

Yellow gold shining from the mud
Long ago bullet in my bread
God my heart is ready now
Now hold me while I'm naked

Catharsis between your knees
I'll serve the bearing trees

God my heart is ready now
God my heart is ready now
Now that I killed my gods below
Whatever I thought, I used to know
The breath of flowers beneath the snow
'Neath the snow, 'neath the snow, let it go
