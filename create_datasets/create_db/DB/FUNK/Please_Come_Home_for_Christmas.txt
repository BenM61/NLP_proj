Bells will be ringing
The glad, glad news
Oh, what a Christmas
To have the blues
My baby's gone
I have no friends
To wish me greetings
Once again 
Choirs will be singing
"Silent Night"
Christmas carols
By candlelight

Please come home for Christmas
Please come home for Christmas
If not for Christmas

Then by New Year's Night 
Friends and relations
Send salutations
Sure as the stars shine above
It's Christmas time, my dear
The time of year
To be, with the one you love 
Then won't you tell me
You'll never more roam
Christmas and New Year's
Will find you home
There'll be no more sorrow
No grief and pain
Then I'll be happy, happy
Once again
short interlude
No more sorrow
No grief and pain
But I'll be happy
Christmas
Once again
