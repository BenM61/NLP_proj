All the joy in my life had rotted away,
I saw a vision in blue and my blues flew away.
And just for a second I truly believed,
Though I don't know what in.

We tried to talk to each other,
But the words that came out of our mouths
Were carried away on the wind,
Which turned them inside out.

In desperation I tried
To communicate with my eyes
When all you've seen is people's pain,
It's hard to feign surprise.

And we just smile.
