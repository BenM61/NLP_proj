The young gentleman came riding past
On a snow-blue winter's day
He asked to drink by our fire
And I was pleased to let him stay
He drank there quietly for a while
And then he turned and said to me

Your eyes are green like summer grass
Your lips are red like a fresh-cut rose
Your hair is soft like an Irish stream
And your voice is filled with sweet beauty
And the last words I heard him say were
I shall return, for you, my love, on Christmas Day

And the night will come, but I won't sleep
As I watch the stars that lead him
I cannot place where he is
But still my heart goes with him
I'm saving all my Sunday clothes
For the day that I'll be leaving

Father knows, my sister knows
And my friends, they're happy for me
And the priest he says, you should thank God
For the blessing of such beauty
And the last words I heard him say were
I shall return for you my love on Christmas Day

I shall return for you my love on Christmas Day

And the last words I heard him say
Were the last words I ever heard him say

I shall return for you my love on Christmas Day
I said I will return on Christmas Day
And yes, I shall return on Christmas day
I shall return, for you, on Christmas Day
My love, I will return on Christmas Day
I shall return, my love, on Christmas Day
On Christmas Day
