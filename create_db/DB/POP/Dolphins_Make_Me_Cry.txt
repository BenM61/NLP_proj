Don't know what the world is going to do
Or if we can get off the road that we're on
There's hate in my brother's eye but as the time goes by,
I get harder.

They say we learn by our mistakes and then we carry on
Sometimes I'm not sure, sometimes I'm not sure
There's no brakes on this car as it rolls down the hill 
My muscles are straining now, my foot's through the floor.

Perhaps that's why, perhaps that's why
I see the dolphins and it makes me cry
As I look in your eyes, I look in your eyes
As the time goes by, makes me cry.

Don't want to go to school anymore today
Because history, she keeps on repeating herself
She can't forgive; she just licks all of her wounds
Sore is the day, and sore is the night.

Perhaps that's why, perhaps that's why
I see the dolphins and it makes me cry
As I look in your eyes, I look in your eyes
As the time goes by, makes me cry.

When I was a boy, when I was growing up
I remember life was so simple; life was so sweet
Now that I'm older, I'm wise as a fool
I keep on breaking those golden, golden rules

And perhaps that's why, perhaps that's why
I see the dolphin and it makes me cry.
As I look in your eye, as I look in your eye
As the time goes by, makes me cry.

Perhaps that's why
I see the dolphin and it makes me cry.
As I look in your eye, ask I look in your eye
As the time goes by, makes me cry.

Did you ever touch the loneliness of a broken man?
Did you see a starving child die?
Do we really do these things to one another?
Do you see why

Dolphins make me cry.
