We must hurry up and 
Make love before 
Our mother shows up 
She'll get nuts on us
I've almost forgot
How it feels to be
In this room again
These walls are drowning me
But I'm feeling so expensive
You make me glow
Yes I'm feeling so extensive
Do you know that I'll cost you?
Here alone with you
Worries fade away
I touch your precious face
Chiseled out by my pain
Both badly knocked about 
In this room again
We have shut the coldness out
For a little while
Let's tango let's dangle
And let them sleep
Let's get lost let's defrost
Come play with me
