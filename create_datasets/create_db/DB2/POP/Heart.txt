Heart, why are you pounding
Like a hammer
Heart, why are you beating like a drum
Heart, why do you make
Such a commotion
When I'm waiting for my baby to come

Oh heart, don't do it
If it's not the real thing
Heart, I get so easily deceived
Heart, there is no other I can turn to
If not you, heart, then who can I believe

Oh heart, there must be no mistake
Beware, special care from the start
Oh heart, though I'm glad
For the first bit of love we've had
Make certain or else
You're gonna break

Heart, you motor of emotion
Heart, you've never been
Like this before
Heart, at first I thought
That you were joking
But I know deep down in you
That you're sure

Oh heart, there must be no mistake
Beware, special care from the start
Oh heart, though I'm glad
For the first bit of love we've had
Make certain or else
You're gonna break

Oh heart, heart, heart
I said heart
Oh heart, heart, heart
I said heart
