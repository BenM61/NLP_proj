Why do I love him? He don't love back
When I call his name, he turns his back
The weather is growing cold
And I want him back again

I kinda know this other guy but he's rather
Old enough to be my father
So he's not the one for me
'Cause I fancy younger men
I'm at a loss
Not a coincidence he left me because
My older man
Was ready to love me like the woman that I am
Ooh

So is it such a problem if he's old?
As long as he does whatever he's told
I'm glad that it's just my heart that he stole
And left my dignity alone

When in Rome we landed our first kiss
I slurred my words but he pretended not to notice
And then he sat down to play
My heart sang a symphony
So far, so swimmingly
I'm glad I got up to find my fish in that sea
We've come so far
So who gives a damn about the ages we are
Ooh

So is it such a problem if he's old?
As long as he does whatever he is told
I'm glad that it's just my heart that he stole
And left my dignity alone

So is it such a problem that he's old?
As long as he does whatever he is told
I know I'm gonna survive the December cold

With somebody to retrieve my long lost soul
