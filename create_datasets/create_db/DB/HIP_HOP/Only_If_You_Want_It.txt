[Chorus:Repeat x4] 
Only if you want it 
Yes I really want it 

Can I get an eye open up 
Eazy locin' up 
Smokin' up 
Much dust like a nut what 
Give it up for the real stuff 
Shut the what up 
Back the shut up what 
Hustler from the hood hoe 
Hopin' and mud rub 
The finishin' touches 
Would sure went rubbers 
Comin' in bunches 
Could serve like lunches 
Hold ya horses here's where the source is 
Not very tall but never took a short kid 
With a clip to claw 
Wouldn't draw McGraw 
I trick a law before all and all I'm raw 
A naughty shorty, sporty with a forty 
A laddy takin' tours, just to plan an orgy 
A nasty critter, any hoe hitter 
Hated my babysitter cause she wouldn't let me hit her 
Now get up on it, on and on get on it 
And I will pump it, only if you want it. 

[Chorus] 

Here's something from the ding dong cause 
I really care how long ya been strong grown 
Here comes the switch dome chrome 
Couldn't hang with the king 
Out the rudder but I call for a yes y'all toots 
My style is just as fresh as a dusch bush 
I face ya fact throw a heck just like woody wooder 
And if I left that means I should of booger 
Here's a new track, for all the new jacks 
I'm kickin' it the hardest so gimmie my shoes back 
So I live when I step it's the pimp 
And I rep so make a right and get left quick 
So try to play strong and long gone 
The flow is kinda funky but far from Armstrong 
Get up on it, on and on get on it 
And I will pump it, only if you want it. 

[Chorus] 

Ooooooh a new jack! a new jack! 

Kid I swear I saw a puddy cat 
Back back smack, here comes a witty black 
Endin' in a skull high I'm bout to show why 
Eazy's fillin' caps cause my gat's in the low ride 
Bang when the gat sneaks, two in the back seat 
My homie rides shotgun waitin' to spot one 
Duh is a fool who don't ride to slide to a ride 
I'm shudder shakin' the place when I start hey 
So don't butter, Eazy-E but a park hey 
The only thing to flow these now to be fly is a feather 
I see the smilin' faces of while they sick 
Ya know me better, hard Rodney kid 
Gettin' Cali kid, now ya know it boy 
Left up in the alley dead 
Now get up on it, on and on get on it 
And I will pump it, only if you want it.

[Chorus]
