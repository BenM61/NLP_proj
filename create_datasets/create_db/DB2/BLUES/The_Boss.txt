Fancy me
Thought I had my degree
In life and how love
Ought to be right

I had a one step plan to prove it
Guide in my pocket for fools
Falling in love
Love had to show me one thing

I was so right thought I could
Turn emotion on and off
I was so sure but love taught me
Who was the boss

I defy anyone who claims
That I didn't control
Whatever moved
In my soul

I could touch, touch delight
Just because you fell for me
Why should I feel uptight
Love had to show me one thing

I was so right thought I could
Turn emotion on and off
I was so sure but love taught me
Who was the boss

I was so right thought I could
Turn emotion on and off
I was so sure but love taught me
Who was the boss

I was so right thought I could
Turn emotion on and off
I was so sure but love taught me
Who was the boss

I was so right thought I could
Turn emotion on and off
I was so sure but love taught me
Who was the boss
