I look in your eyes, I see the deception
You're holdin the only key
You're fooling the fools, who think it's the real thing
But there's just no foolin' me

Connect me, don't break away
Protect me 'ah' from your fate
Inject me, my lips are sealed
Connect me

Connect me to your love
When you're beside me
I feel the fire in my soul
Connect me to your love
Won't hypnotize me
And you'll never take control

The dreamers who dream
But it's not the real thing
They fall oh so easily
They're running for cover
But there's just no other
One that is made for me

Connect me, don't break away
Protect me, 'ah' from your fate
Inject me, my lips are sealed
Connect me

I'm walking on air
But love isn't fair
There's no rules
If this is the case
That look on your face
Let me feel your sweet embrance
