Picking up the pieces up off the floor
How was I to know there was gonna be a war
Words of sorrow and words of spite
Ringing in my head right through the night

And don't you know it's a cry-yin' shame
When you've got yourself to blame
Don't you know it's a cry-yin' shame

Woke up this morning, it's a raining again
Starting to wonder if it's something I said
Words of sorrow and words of spite
Ringing in my head right through the night

And don't you know it's a cry-yin' shame
When you've got yourself to blame
Don't you know it's a cry-yin' shame

You've got yourself to blame

Cry, cry, why, cry-why, cry-yin' shame
Cry, cry, why, why, why, why, why, why

Cry, cry, why, cry, why, crying shame
Cry, cry, why, cry, why, why, crying shame

Up all night with a conscience fight
I just can't sleep so I put on the light
The sheets are wet with anxiety sweat
Mornings gonna come but it ain't here yet

And don't you know it's a cry-yin' shame
When you've got yourself to blame
Don't you know it's a cry-yin' shame

You've got yourself

Don't you know it's a crying shame (it's a crying shame)
When you've got yourself to blame (don't you know)
Don't you know it's a crying shame
You've got yourself to blame
You've got yourself to blame
You've got yourself to blame
You've got yourself to blame
You've got yourself to blame

I'm to blame, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
