She's a miracle, she got everybody talking
She don't care at all
Watch the way she's walking
Ooh, she's a classy girl
Got danger in her touch,
She should come with a warning
When she struts her stuff, every head is turning
Ooh, she's a classy girl

My girl is superbad, super-stacked
Got no time for photographs, watch out!
My girl is superbad
That's a fact, knock your train right off the track
Watch out!
She's divine all the time (all the time)
And everything she does, it's always by design
My girl is superbad
That's a fact, knock your train right off the track
Watch out!

Treated like a Queen,
Don't need no permission
Sexy's her routine, she's the definition
Ooh, she's a classy girl

My girl is superbad, super-stacked
Got no time for photographs, watch out!
My girl is superbad
That's a fact, knock your train right off the track
Watch out!
She's divine all the time
And everything she does, it's always by design
My girl is superbad
That's a fact, knock your train right off the track
Watch out!
You feel me?

My girl's a supersonic sex machine
She'll put that technicolor in your screen
Yeah, she's a super-psychedelic dream
My girl is super, super, superbad

My girl is superbad, super-stacked
Got no time for photographs, watch out!
My girl is superbad
That's a fact, knock your train right off the track
Watch out!
She's divine (She's divine) all the time (all the time)
And everything she does, it's always by design
My girl is superbad
That's a fact, knock your train right off the track
Watch out!
Watch out!
