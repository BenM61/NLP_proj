Now I lay me down to sleep
I'm praying Lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
Somebody make a big mistake

I'm only just one little man
Just usin' up the air
Still I'm askin' anyway
Lord when I pray, please be there
Lord when I pray, please be there

Singin' om om my god, please be there
You know I'm just like all my kind
I got a weak and confused mind
When I feel a little pain

You know how I love to complain
But I try to be strong
I try hard to lift my share
I don't expect for nothing

But Lord when I pray, please be there
Now I sing for you
