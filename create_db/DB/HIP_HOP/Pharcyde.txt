[Imani]
"None of that's true" 
We do it not you 
That' why I got you 
Stuck on 
To my style like glue! 
The crew 
Definitely is back again 
But I'm back to win 
So just tell a friend 
That I'm still 
Twisting and bending 
Minds and rhymes until the very end 
With the rhymes 
And the loops 
Stomping out wack troops 
In my big black boots 
Collecting respect and the loot! 
From the way I grab the microphone 
And execute, "iahp's" think I'm cute 

[Bootie Brown]
(Say what?) 
Yo man, I pay them no 
Attention I stay deep into 
The cut cause I leave the 
Tricks alone cause my name 
Is not David Copper-Filled 
Pockets, never net a man 
Who don't hate it 
So let it be stated 
Niggas couldn't fade it with an 
Edit, 
And Xerox M.C.'s 
Are pathetic, they tryin' to 
Duplicate but their comin' 
Out synthetic 
The name is Bootie Brown and phony M.C.'s forget 
It. 

[Chorus: x2]
Imani Bootie Brown Fatlip and Slimkid Tre 
Imani Bootie Brown Fatlip and Slimkid Tre 
Imani Bootie Brown Fatlip and Slimkid Tre 
We do it this way 
We do it this way 

[Fatlip]
I step toward the MIC grinnin' 
The lyrical imperial award winnin' 
Rhymes like a balloon that got a pin in it 
Because my shit be poppin' 
Like gin and juice I seduce these iahps to get 
Loose 
When I'm droppin' 
These rhymes on drums 
Like my nigga Def Jef 
My style is more unknown than what happens 
After death 
I come fresh like your breath after your brush 
Wack MC's like that orange soda got crushed 

[Slim Kid3]
Well it's apparent that many 
Are so transparent you 
Can't believe ya eyes when 
Ya starin it's ghostly and 
Mostly the wise who 
Yeah they just run these games 
Before ya eyes to tell you 
Lies framed in gold glitter 
For many moons I've been 
A go getter took miles of 
Manure from the purest bullshitters 
Now them mutha fuckas ain't wit us 
To get us 
M-walk shake the cut through their 
Neutro-transmitter 

[Chorus: x2]

[Imani]
You must respect me 
Because I come directly from my internal 
While my eternal 
Infernos steadily towering 
And over-powering 
All sour sounding wishin' wishy-washy 
Competition 
Definitely wack and lackin' 
And stable ammunition 
Change ya mission 
Men and listen 
My way your salutations 
Get no validations 
Just rejections and ejections 
Outta my Hitachi 

[Slim Kid3] 
Come on and taste the real 
Step on inside and confide 
In the feel I reside 
By steel waters just a gear 
On the wheel no fear on 
The steel just a son of Jiva 
Who won't leave my field
