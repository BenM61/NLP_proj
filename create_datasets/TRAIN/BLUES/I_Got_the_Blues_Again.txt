i should be crying over you baby
but you've been so true to me
i shouldn't cry over you baby 
but you've been so true to me
when i get to thinking baby
why the blues won't let me be
if the blues would leave me, i think i'd know what to do
i've got the blues again
can't think of anyone but you
you don't love me
and your love ain't fair
i can find me another woman
anyplace, anywhere
