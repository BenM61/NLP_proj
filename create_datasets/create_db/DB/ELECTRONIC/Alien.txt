The satellite comes and goes
We give each other all we know
In silence we still talk
By the light of the stereo we waltz

And will you rain down
In your cinematic love truck
I'm gonna hold you like
Nothing's gonna stop us

And she comes to take me away
She's all that I needed
I don't breathe another lover, no

Flicker on a TV screen
Everything's more than it seems
The mighty backward fall
We stare at the light on the wall

And I swear to this
She felt like velvet
Second blonde child
Like velvet, velvet

And she comes to take me away
She's all that I needed
I don't breathe another lover, uh

I'm an alien, you're an alien
It's a beautiful rain, a beautiful rain
I'm an alien, you're an alien
It's a beautiful rain, a beautiful rain

I'm an alien, you're an alien
It's a beautiful rain, beautiful rain, beautiful rain
Beautiful, beautiful, oh

When she come around again
When she come around again, around again
Around again, around again

I'm an alien, you're an alien
It's a beautiful rain, beautiful rain
I'm an alien, you're an alien
It's a beautiful rain, beautiful rain

I'm an alien, you're an alien

Beautiful rain, a beautiful rain, a beautiful rain

Alien, alien, alien, alien
Alien, alien, alien, alien
Alien, alien, alien, alien
Alien, alien
