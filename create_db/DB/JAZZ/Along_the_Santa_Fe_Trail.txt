Angels come to paint the desert nightly 
When the moon is beaming brightly 
Along the Santa Fe Trail 
Stardust scattered all along the highway 

On a rainbow-colored skyway 
Along the Santa Fe Trail 
Beside you 
I'm riding every hill and dale 

Wide shadows hide you 
Just like a pretty purple veil 
Thereby hangs a tale 
I found you 

And the mountains that surround you 
Are the wall I built around you 
Along the Santa Fe trail...
