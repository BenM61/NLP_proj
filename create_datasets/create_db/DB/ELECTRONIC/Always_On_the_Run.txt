Not on time
Never staying around
If you stop me then
We'll be on our own we'll be on our own
This time try trying hard to make it better
If you stop me then
We'll be on our own we'll be on our own

Always on the run
Always on the run
Always on the run
Always on the run
Always on the run

So many birds can entertain us
You may be fucked but you understand us
So get your gun down and then
We'll be on our own we'll be on our own
This time try trying hard to make it better
If you stop me then
We'll be on our own we'll be on our own

Always on the run
Always on the run
Always on the run
Always on the run
Always on the run

You're damn right
You gave out promises (promises)
It's not it's not the same
The things change and never never the same
The things change
Being lost in time has never been a crime
If you stop me then
We'll be on our own we'll be on our own

Always on the run
Always on the run
Always on the run
Always on the run
Always on the run
Always on the run 

The things change the things change
The things change it's not the same now
The things change it's not the same now
The things change it's not the same now
The things change it's not the same now
The things change
