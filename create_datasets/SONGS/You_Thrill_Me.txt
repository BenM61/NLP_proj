Now that you say our romance is through

I want you to know that I'll never get over you.
And I can't believe you're out looking
For somebody new so soon
Not after all that we had

Breaking my heart and it's so sad.
I'll never get over you
'Cause

You thrill me

Every night
Every day you thrill me
Baby don't take it away
You thrill me

Lord
I need you to stay
'Cause you thrill me
You thrill me.

Now that you've gone I'll try to pretend
But baby
I ain't much good
At playing a game I can't win.
And if we could have it all over again
Oh
Baby I'd be so good to you

All the things that I would do

I'll never get over you
Cause

You thrill me

Oh
Baby
I'd be so good to you

All the things that I would do
I'll never get over you
'cause

You thrill me
