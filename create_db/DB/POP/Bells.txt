I know it's late
I know the curtain's drawn over your window
Maybe fate, or maybe just the tug of lonely made me call
But anyway, love, I'm hearing bells
I just thought you should hear the bells
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

Oh oh I, I can hardly wait
I woke up in a world that's suddenly heart-shaped
Throwing you a line, send me back a sign, love
One by land or two by sea

Oh Bells
Nothing here but bells
Ringing in my heart
La la la la la la

Meet me at the tower
We'll hang on to the ropes and swing out
Meet me at the tower
We'll hang on to the ropes and swing out

Bells, in my heart
Oh bells, in my heart
Bum bum la la la la la la la
Bum bum la la la la la la
Bum bum la la la la la la la
Bum bum bum bum bum

I can feel the sky cracking in my heart
It's falling to the pavement
Don't know where to start
So, let's go to the tower
One more time
And Climb high, love, climb high

Oh bells
Nothing here but bells ringing in my heart
In my heart
In my heart
In my heart
La la la la
