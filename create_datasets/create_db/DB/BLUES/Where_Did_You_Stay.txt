If you need me call my name
I'll come a-runnin'
Like a choo-choo train
I'll always love you
Always feel the same
You told me a lie
You made made me cry
I'll always love you
Till the day I die

I'm goin' far away
And I'm goin' goin' to stay
If you don't see me no more
Meet me on your Monday
But if you need me call my name
I'll come a-runnin'
Like a choo-choo train
Cause I'll always love you
Always feel the same
