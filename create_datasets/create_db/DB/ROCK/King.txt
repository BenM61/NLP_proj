You died within me
The boatmen came to sail me down the river
Bind me up with visions of a blind man
I operate this way
Turn nothing into gold
Death on such an ugly day
You dine like a king on top of the world

You show us all
That forgiveness is the weakest call
And now revenge
Against that grudge inside your tiny head
Remove the crown of absolution
Let the retribution fly
The king has all the king has all
But words can kill and maim and take their toll
And you massacre my dreams at night
And eat away at every thought
Until we take control
The king has all totalitarian and carnivore

Bow down submit to me and kiss the ground
Until it's safe to breathe and coexist again
Bow down submit to me and kiss the ground
Until it's safe to live and coexist again

They're taking away the freedom to be just you
They're taking away the freedom to be just you
They're taking away the freedom to be just you
They're taking away the freedom to be just you
But the sun always shines for you
They're taking away the freedom to be just you

You'd kill to find me
But the crown above my head is deadly

They're taking away the freedom to be just you
They're taking away the freedom to be just you
