Last night I had a dream of you,
My heart began to cry,
I saw you kissing someone new,
But dreams can tell a lie.

The moon was bright,
He held you tight,
I heard you softly sigh.
Two silhouettes were swaying,
What words were you saying?
No wonder I've been praying
That dreams can tell a lie!

For where there's smoke you'll find a fire,
And in my dreams I saw the gleam of your desire!

Tonight we'll meet along the street
And all my fears will fly,
Your loving arms will hold me,
And as they enfold me,
Your kiss will soon have told me
That dreams can tell a lie.

Your kiss will soon have told me
That dreams can tell a lie.
