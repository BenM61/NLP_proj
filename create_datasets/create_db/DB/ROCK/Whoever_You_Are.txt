Whoever you are, wherever you may be
There's someone who really loves you
Please wait and see, whoever you are
Whoever you are (whoever you are)
Whoever you are (whoever you are)

Dry those tears, there's no need for crying
I'm sure your lover will soon come to find you
Whoever you are, whoever you are

When God made Adam, Adam and Eve
He also made a lover, a lover for you
And a lover for me
So don't fret, wait patiently, for soon a love
Will hit you the way it hit me

Whoever you are, wherever you may be
There's someone who really loves you
Please wait and see

Whoever you are, whoever you are
Whoever you are, whoever you are
Whoever you are
