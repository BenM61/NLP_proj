Yeah, you know they gonna bring him down
They gonna wreck it down, yeah

Something's come to rock me
And I can't keep my head
I get nervous in the New York City streets
Where my legacy treads
I know I'm better off standing in the shadows
Far from humans with guns
But now it's too late, there's no escape
From what they have done,
C'mon

I'm going deeper underground
There's too much panic in this town
I'm going deeper underground
There's too much panic in this town
I'm going deeper underground
But I got to go deeper, got to go much deeper, yeah
Cuh-heh, they gonna wreck it down, yeah
Step do-do-do-dow-di-dow-di-down
Hey we're gonna bring it down, yeah

Some people with a pocket full of money
And an eye full of hate
Take a pleasure in destruction
Of the very thing that they tried to create
Somebody tell me why does all
Mankind only tamper and touch?
Have a habit where they-bite off
More they can chew
And now it's too much

I'm going deeper underground, hey ha
There's too much panic in this town
I'm going deeper underground
There's too much panic in this town
I'm going deeper underground
There's too much panic in this town

I'm going, I'm going, I'm going
Deeper underground
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going
Deeper underground
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going
Deeper underground
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going
Deeper underground

Something's come to rock me
And I can't keep my head
I get nervous in the New York City streets
Where my legacy treads
I know I'm better off standing in the shadows
Far from humans with guns
But now it's too late, there's no escape
From what they have done

(Got to go) I'm going deeper underground
(Got to go deeper) I'm going, I'm going (deeper)
I'm going (deeper), I'm going (yeah)
I'm going deeper underground
(I'm going, I'm going
Got to go deep
(I'm going, I'm going)
I'm going deeper underground
(Deeper, deeper)
Got to get down now
I'm going, I'm going.
