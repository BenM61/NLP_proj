I got Jesus in my head, like a stinger.
He moves from tree to tree,
In the back of my mind.
A ragged shadowy figure;
I got him.

I got original sin.
I got original sin.
I got original sin.
I got original sin.

I got a demon in my head, like a stinger.
He moves from tree to tree,
In the back of my mind.
I got a bad seed, I gotta feed.
I got him.

If you play with fire,
You're gonna get burned.
Some of my friends
Are gonna die young.

If you play with fire,
You're gonna get burned.
Some of my friends
Are gonna die young.
Are gonna die young.
Are gonna die young.
Are gonna die young.
