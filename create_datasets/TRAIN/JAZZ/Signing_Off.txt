Signing off
Does it surprise you
I won't need your lips anymore
Signing off

Can't idolize you
My heart crossed your name off the door
Signing off
Now that I've told you
That this is just where I came in

Signing off
Why should I hold you
You've already said I can't win
It's strange how the rest of the world knows

The things you should see at a glance
And I want what all of the world knows
A person to person romance

Signing off
I can't pretend dear
My trip to the stars took a spill
We're all through

This is the ending
Because you only wanted a thrill
I'm signing off
I'll always remember the pleasure

Of friendship and all that it's worth
I know that it's something to treasure
From here to the ends of the earth

Signing off
Happy I met you
So please make me happy again
And be sure I won't forget you
The best of everything until then

I'm signing off
Signing Off
