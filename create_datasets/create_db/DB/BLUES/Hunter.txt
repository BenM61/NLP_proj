They call me the hunter, that's my name
A pretty woman like you, is my only game
I bought me a love gun, just the other day
And I aim to aim it your way
Ain't no use to hide, ain't no use to run
'Cause I've got you in the sights of my love gun

The first time I saw you, standing on the street
I says to myself, woo, ain't she sweet
I've got my love gun loaded, with hugs and kisses
And when I pull the trigger, there will be no misses
Ain't no need to hide, ain't no use to run
'Cause I've got you in the sights of my love gun

Ain't no use to hide, ain't no use to run
'Cause I've got you in the sights of my love gun

I'm the big bad hunter baby
How can I miss when I've got dead aim
