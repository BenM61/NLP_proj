And then sweet fishtail into a monster truck of shame
Carved out of soap and steel and clay and salty fame
You were the first to look away and against me 
Well shake the squirrel out your tree 

Blind 
Get dressed and go outside 
Fluoresce into the sky 
His arms will open wide 
All that you see is

I know it's you still breathing static in my ear 
Truly damning and pretending I can't hear
You think I'm sleepin' when I peek and see your bra
Forgot you told me in your car

Blind
Get dressed and go outside 
Fluoresce into the sky 
His arms will open wide 
All that you see is

Blind
Get dressed and go outside
Fluoresce into the sky 
His arms will open wide
All that you see is

And then you ask me why I pin this to your shirt
Although your hands are clean your heels are caked with dirt
So put me on your list of men that have gone sour
And you're the couple of the hour 

Blind
Get dressed and go outside
Fluoresce into the sky 
His arms will open wide
All that you see is

Blind
Get dressed and go outside
Fluoresce into the sky 
His arms will open wide
All that you see is

Blind
Get dressed and go outside
Fluoresce into the sky 
His arms will open wide
All that you see is blind
