Ooh sha la la la la la la
Ooh sha la la la la la la
Tedium is overcome
From obscurity, through melody
And when I'm blind it helps me
See through your key

No one can touch, no need to rush
Presented by my alibi
When I'm down it brings me round so easily
At eight o'clock I take my leave
And when I'm done and dusted, tonight I'm gonna be

I'll be a karaoke queen, it's not me you see
I'm gonna take you down to a place
I know you'd rather be
It's just a 3 minute song, it doesn't last very long
But it'll take you take you to a place,
I know you'd rather be
Hey you can dance, 

Ooh sha la la la la la la
Ooh sha la la la la la la
Common sense has excuses, recklessness, it's uses
But don't go fusing silence with charisma
At nine o'clock you can count on me
That when I'm up I'm ready, tonight I'm gonna be

I'll be a karaoke queen, it's not me you see
I'm gonna take you down to a place
I know you'd rather be
It's just a 3 minute song, it doesn't last very long
But it'll take you take you to a place,
I know you'd rather be
Where you can dance
Ooh sha la la la la la la
Ooh sha la la la la la la 

I'm doomed to fail, the stage gives way
It's an apostrophe to my legacy
But though I'm bruised,
I'll happily do it all again

At 10 O'clock don't wait up for me
'cause when I'm up I'm ready
Tonight I'm gonna be...Matthew!
I'll be a karaoke queen, it's not me you see
I'm gonna take you down to a place
I know you'd rather be
It's just a 3 minute song, it doesn't last very long
But it'll take you take you to a place,
I know you'd rather be
And you can dance if you want to
Show appreciation
But step up the mic for the full sensation
And you can dance
And you can dance
And you can dance
And you can ooh la la la ooh sha la la la
