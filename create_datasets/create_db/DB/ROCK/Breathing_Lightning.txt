I have walked this world and back now
Too many times to count or stop, how? 
Time is nothing, slow and focused
I stalk this land with just one purpose

A deal made the second that you choose to force my will
An extension of my hand with the intent to kill by the white lightning
You always have the chance to do the right thing
Until the right thing comes undone
And with a thunderclap I'm breathing lightning
And this world has moved on

My body's broken there's no quit
My will intact and I can't stop it
Hearts and minds can see the end
Until it all happens again
Like so many before you
You'll see what death will bring
After me there's no one else
No angels there to sing just the white lightning

You always have the chance to do the right thing
Until the right thing comes undone
And with a thunderclap I'm breathing lightning
And this world has moved on
I look inside myself is this the right thing? 
Is this the right thing, I don't know

Ah
Like so many before you
We'll see what death will bring
Can you hear the angels sing? 
Do you hear the angels sing? 
Like so many before you, I'd do anything
Just to hear the angels sing
Just to hear the angels sing

You always have the chance to do the right thing
Until the right thing comes undone (it comes undone)
And then with a thunderclap I'm breathing lightning
And this world has moved on (it moves on)
I look inside myself is this the right thing? 
Is this the right thing, I don't know
Ah
Ah
