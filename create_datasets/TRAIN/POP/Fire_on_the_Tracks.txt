There's a fire on the tracks
And the train's movin' closer each day
To that fire on the tracks
Hey, don't nobody get in the way

Feel it coming right now
Want to stop it, but how
Can't you see there's a fire on the tracks
Don't you know

That you're headed for pain
Look out,
There's a fire up ahead on the tracks,
And it's you on the train

Yeah, it's you on the train
There's a movie somewhere
In the chaotic paths of our lives
There's a movie in there

It's the story of everyday lies
Like some paperback dream
I hear somebody scream
Hey mister, there's a fire on the tracks

Can't you see that you're headed for pain
Don't you know
There's a fire up ahead on the tracks,
And that's you on the train

It's you on the train
Hey mister, there's a fire on the tracks
Can't you see that you're headed for a pain
Don't you know

There's a fire up ahead on the tracks,
And that's you on the train
Look out there's a fire
There's a fire on the tracks

Don't you know
That you're headed for nothing but pain
'Cause it's you on the train,
It's you on the train

Look out now,
Fire
There's a fire on the track
Don't you know

That you're headed for nothing but pain
'Cause it's you on the train,
Yeah
It's you on the train
