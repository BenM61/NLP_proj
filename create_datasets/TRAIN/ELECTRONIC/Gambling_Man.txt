I met you once, I loved you twice
That's the way this tale begins
I played my hand, I rolled the dice
Now I'm paying for my sins
I got some bad addiction
Baby, it's you, yeah, yeah, that's right
And I feel you taking over me
Could luck be a lady in here tonight

My odds are stacked
I've never been a gambling man
I've never had the winning hand
But for you I'd lose it all
My odds are stacked
I've never been a gambling man
I've never had the winning hand
But for you I'd lose it all (Baby, I'd lose it all)

Baby, oh could you be the queen of hearts
Or the devil in disguise with every move
I'm blinded by those diamonds in her eyes
I got some bad addiction 
Baby, it's you, yeah, yeah, that's right
And I feel you taking over me
Could luck be a lady in here tonight

My odds are stacked
I've never been a gambling man
I've never had the winning hand
But for you I'd lose it all
My odds are stacked
I've never been a gambling man
I've never had the winning hand
But for you I'd lose it all (Baby, I'd lose it all)

I'm captured in your sweet lovin'
But it feels just like a curse
You're beneath my skin, I start tremblin'
With this love so dangerous
I want you, why don't you, just place your bets on me

My odds are stacked
I've never been a gambling man
I've never had the winning hand
But for you I'd lose it all
My odds are stacked
I've never been a gambling man
I've never had the winning hand
But for you I'd lose it all

My odds are stacked
I've never been a gambling man
I've never had the winning hand
But for you I'd lose it all
My odds are stacked
I've never been a gambling man
I've never had the winning hand
But for you I'd lose it all, yeah, but for you, I'd lose it all
