Underwater I would be safe and calm with you
A ghost whispering all gospels to you 

Soak my heart into your dreams
Until my rivers running deep, feel your beat

My heart as a river, running deep
My heart as a river, running deep

In your waters, I am a whirl that turns you
Pour all of my care right into your blue

Soak your heart into my dreams
Into my stream

My heart as a river, running deep
My heart as a river, running deep 
(Running deep, running deep, running deep)

My heart as a river, running deep
Running deep, running deep (running deep)
