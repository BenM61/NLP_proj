[Lil' Romeo]
Hut 1, Hut 2
Hut 1, Hut 2
Hut 1, Hut 2

[Lil' Romeo]
I'm lookin' for a girl who can show me around
Hold me down
Puppy love girl, how that sound
Remind me of a wish
First kiss
Can't explain the way I feel a lil young for this
When I see you all I seem to feel is happiness
Grab ya wrist
Girl you extravagant
Beautiful,
Beauty unusual
Ain't gone stop 'til I get through to you
What's ya name Ma
I wanna hang Ma
Feel like takin' a ride on the swang Ma
You my queen Ma
Be ya king Ma
I bring you everything in ya life you can think Ma
If we were older I'd give you a ring Ma
Take you to the concert where they sing Ma
For now I'mma let you do ya thing Ma
But if ya man turn out
He's not getting' a thing Ma

(Chorus)- 2X
[Allusion]
Twinkle twinkle little star
How I wonder where you are
Let's bounce to the spot
Baby take a ride
This song is just for you and I

[Lil' Romeo]
Got a spot in the shade
Cold lemonade
Man you hot from ya feet to ya braids
Dimples in ya cheeks
Love to eat sweets
Got a baby Humma so you and me can creep
Got me a phone in case you wanna speak
Let me slow down, it's getting' too deep
You call me what's up
Now I'm tryin' to eat
Don't even trip
Lunch's on me
McDonalds, Wendy's, Burger King
C'mon, it's on you
Do ya thang
Move ya hips
Make ya elbows swang
Wobble it girl, move that thang
Get crunked up, I'mma use that thang
Hold up, you we do that thang
Hope you got friends, 'cause mine wanna hang
Here come the chorus again, now sang

(Chorus)-2X

[Lil' Romeo]
Gloss on your lips
Gloss when you kiss
Gotta be love if I feel like this
Love it when ya walk
Twist in ya hips
Everytime you speak
I swear my heart skips
Warm inside
Hot like July
Get butterflies when I look in your eyes
Last in my class
Friends getting mad
Can't wait to meet ya mom
And you can meet my dad
Smile a little more
You look so sad
You look too good to be seen like that
A boy should never act mean like that
I neva eva eva wanna see you look like that
Enjoy the night
Dim the lights
This can't be wrong
It feels too right
Turn the music up
Dim the lights
Rome-e-rome
I'm in the zone tonight

(Chorus)-2X

[Allusion]
My boyfriend (friend)
I can be your girl (girl, girl)
You can be my baby
Come and share my world
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon

(Chorus)-2X
