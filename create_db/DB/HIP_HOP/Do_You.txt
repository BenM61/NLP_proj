If you ain't feelin' me, may just walk away
Is all I doin', what more can I say
Do you, 'cause nigga I'mma do me
Do you, 'cause nigga I'mma do me
Do you, 'cause nigga I'mma do me
Do you, nigga

Let me attempt to spit this
Assist this with a pen in my fist
I'm scriptin' Sonny Liston's lost be
Quick six whips sick clique it's Slum V

We stick chicks 'til their extensions fuzzy
Jewelry's thick and chunky ridiculous
Like in them pictures when Slick Rick was a young bee
Boy, and picked his gumby I'm comfy
'Till you insist you'll take my existence from me

Clack, click, the clip spits buddy
I place you in ditches like Egyptians
That stitched mummys, your limpin' bloody
I serve niggas like the homeless Mission kitchen
We're fixin' chicken for the bums free

You can't tell us we don't get this money
We keep a dollar up like Richie Rich's puppy
We looking for the dips with donkey's to hit
It's the Villa gorilla pimps, your chimps and monkeys bitch

If you ain't feelin' me, may just walk away
Is all I doin', what more can I say
Do you, 'cause nigga I'mma do me
Do you, 'cause nigga I'mma do me
Do you, 'cause nigga I'mma do me
Do you, nigga

When you see me in a spot never less than a dime
Y'all might roll with 6 we sit with a 9
See, I'm a sick rapper with a flow that's divine
Y'all might flip the flow but don't flip it like mine

y'all might roll with a squad but it ain't like mine
See I'm quick with the flow Dogg I'm good to the go
I'mma stack till I spit 'til I can't go broke
I want the Benz, the Range, I want it all, I want gold

Then I dips in the whips with the chicks in the clothes
'Cause I chill with the chicks who be the centerfolds
Then I creep to the mo, with a freak on the low
Then I come through the doe, then I mash on the flo

Yeah, I keeps it movin' like the local D.O.T's
Keep serving these yo's with the bad tenancies
Let a nigga do his thang, shit stop sweatin' me
Gone roll with a playa girl its all hustle free

If you ain't feelin' me, may just walk away
Is all I doin', what more can I say
Do you, 'cause nigga I'mma do me
Do you, 'cause nigga I'mma do me
Do you, 'cause nigga I'mma do me
Do you, Jea

But of course it be effortless we pullin' up in the Porsche
Medallion the size of a horse on my necklace
We done it again, done got under your skin
We come hot like a gun pop running you jems

Can none stop this thing of ours
The ladies they fein' and double team in g strings and bras
Make 'em scream like electric strings guitars
Don't hate on the squad 'cause my niggas is stars

Do you
Do you
Do you
