I ran into my ignorance
I think she cares for you
'Cause she's been trickin' on you for quite some time
You need to tell that bitch to change her fucking frequency
When intellectricity come in mega hurts
I'm not trying not to get amped I'm trying to get you

You
I wanna be like you
I want one of them art deco halos that makes everybody hate how
Far they are from you
I wanna be like you baby
I want one of them art deco halos
Just to emphasize my pain

I used to hydroplane all through my astroplane
But now hating Uncle Sam defeats my crimes
He said "I ain't got no guilt, so get up out of my face you whore,
'Cause act like you wouldn't like to take my job."
But he don't know
Nothin' from nothin' leaves you nothin'
That's why he thinks he wins the wars
But it's all that stupid shit, up against my stupid shit
See I don't wanna be me no more
So don't tell me I'm loned
Tell me I'm you

You
I wanna be like you
I want one of them art deco halos that makes everybody hate how
Far they are from you
I wanna be like you baby
I want one of them art deco halos that give everybody else the finger

I ran into Armageddon's tears
And they've got so much love to give
But they just think his love makes the sunshine
I said "if ya'wl ain't really against me then what's your
Fascination with me"
They said "you make transformations all the time
Baby I'm here for you"
But he can't do anything for nothing
Anything he got he'll get from you
And all that stupidness gets to be my stupidness
I can't think or wish, but can hate to be just about anything I am
Except for you

I wanna be like you
