Every day when I open my eyes now
It feels like a Saturday
Taking down from the shelf
All the parts of myself
That I packed away
If it's love put the joy in my heart
Is it God by another name
Who's to say how it goes
All I know is
I'm back in the world again

Like the lift of a curse
Got a whole different person
Inside my head
No more trudging around
Stony eyed through the town
Like the living dead no
It's love that lifts us from the dark
Is it God by another name
Who's to say how it goes
All I know is
I'm back in the world again
Back in the world again

It's the only way to be
It's the only way to be
I'm naked like a tree
It's the only way to be
I'm naked like a tree
It's the only way to be

Less than sand on the beach
Staring into the reaches of space and time
I'm singing out words
But the voice that I hear
It seems barely mine
If it's love put the song in my heart
Is it God by another name
Who's to say how it goes
All I know is
I'm back in the world again
Who's to say how it goes
All I know is
I'm back in the world again
Back in the world again

It's the only way to be
It's the only way to be
I'm naked like a tree
It's the only way to be
I'm naked like a tree
It's the only way to be, the only way to be, the only to be, the only way to be, the only

Every day when I open my eyes
Yeah yeah
Every day when I open my eyes
Yeah yeah [x2]
