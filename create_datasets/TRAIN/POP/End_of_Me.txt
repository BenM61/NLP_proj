Hey
Stay with me
As I'm getting naked
Stripped down to the bone

Hey
I'm afraid
This could get ugly
And I might leave here alone

This is not a mistake
It's the dawn of a new day
Anything goes from now

This is the last of illusions
This is the final trace of innocence
If I'm caught in the middle
I know it will be the end of me

Hey
Talk to me
Don't play me with your silence
Whisper it in my mouth

Cause this is not about hate
It's the start of a new way
Anything goes from now

This is the last of illusions
This is the final trace of innocence
If I'm caught in the middle
I know it will be the end of me

This is not a mistake
It's the dawn of a new day
Hey, this is not a mistake
Stay with me

Hey
Stay with me
As I'm getting naked

This is the last of illusions
This is the final trace of innocence
If I'm caught in the middle
I know it will be the end of me
The end of me

Yeah
