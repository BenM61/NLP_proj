Six o'clock in the morning wipe the sleep from my eyes
Felt just like an ordinary day
Just around the corner,such a surprise a beautiful angel materialised
Time stood still,face to face
I'm sure we'd meet in another time and place

Our eyes met as you passed me by
Two souls entwined in the blink of an eye
And I had to figure out what I'd be missing
So I turned to you and asked if you wanted to

(chorus)
Rendezvous went to my place say 2 & we can do anything you want to do
Hey,tonight is your night yeah
When you clothes your eyes,take a minute,take a moment,realise
Do you see me when you fantasise
Tonight'll be your night

I'm just sitting here daydreaming about you and all the things you do
Girl feels so right
And all I know is you're the one for me,that special kinda'lady
In my life,in my life

Well here I am writing you a love song
Holding back those years,its been so long
And I can't deny the way that I'm feeling
It's true,so girl that's why I'm asking you,can we...

[Chorus]

Darling tell me,what's on your mind? 
What you thinking?
Hey what you thinking? what you thinking?
Darling tell me what's on your mind?
What's on your mind? yeah
Darling what are you thinking?
Now darling what are you thinking...

[Chorus]

I'm just sittin here daydreaming about you and all the things you do
Girl feels so right
And all I know is you're the one for me,that special kinda'lady
In my life,in my life,

Whatcha doing 'cause we'll be rendezvousing & you know we'll be getting jiggy just for fun (x4)
