Smile
Ooh, ooh
Smile
Smile

When in your eyes shine pictures of
A time for us, I melt with love
When your lips kiss, silent words
Move the earth and shake my world

But nothin' means as much (Your smile)
Nothin' seems to touch (Your smile)
Your smile (Your smile)
Oh, if anything I miss (Your smile)
Never could resist (Your smile)
Your smile
Oh, oh, oh

In your touch there's tenderness
A sweet caress that soothes all pain
When I'm lost and feelin' low
To you I go to rise again

But nothin' means as much (Your smile)
Nothin' seems to touch (Your smile)
Your smile (Your smile)
If anything I'd miss (Your smile)
Never could resist (Your smile)
Your smile (Your smile), ho

Baby, smile (Smile)
When you smile (Smile)
My life shines (Smile)
When you smile (Smile)
When you smile (Smile)
My life shines (Smile)
When you smile, oh (Smile)
My life shines (Smile)

(Your smile)
Nothin' seems to touch (Your smile)
Your smile (Your smile)
Oh, hoo, hoo
If anything I'd miss (Your smile)
How could I resist (Your smile)
Your smile (Your smile), oh, oh

(Your smile)
Don't you know your smile (Your smile)
Lights my life (Your smile)
Baby, when you smile (Your smile)
You shine (Your smile)
Your smile (Your smile)
Ho, ho, hoo (Your smile)
Your, your smile (Your smile)
Oh, no other love
(Your smile) can light my life
The way you make me shine (Your smile)
Your baby, smile (Your smile)
Your smile (Your smile)
Baby (Your smile)
Light up my life (Your smile)
No one can make me shine
When my baby smiles (Your smile)
Ooh, oh (Your smile)
Oh, love it (Your smile)
When you smile (Your smile)
Your smile (Your smile)
Your smile
