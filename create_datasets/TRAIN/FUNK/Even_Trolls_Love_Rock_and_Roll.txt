As the crow flies, baby
Will I ain't so far from you
As the crow flies, baby
Will I ain't so far from you
But since I don't have wings
I can't get home as fast as I want to
As the crow flies, baby
Will I ain't so far from you
As the crow flies, baby
Will I ain't so far from you
But since I don't have wings
I can't get home as fast as I want to
In a dream last night
Where I heard you call my name
In a dream last night
Where I heard you call my name
Well, I took it as an omen
And I jumped on the very first weight train
Yeah, as the crow flies
Well, you don't know baby
How I miss you sweet caress
Well, you don't know baby
How I miss you sweet caress
When I'm in your lovin' arms
I swear I make my very best
As the crow flies, baby
That's how I'm on my way
As the crow flies, baby
I'm on my way
But don't stop runnin'
I can get home for the break of day
Get home for the break of day (x7)
