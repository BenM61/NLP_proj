Every day with you girl
Is sweeter than the day before
Everyday I love you more and more
More and more and more
They're saying that all good things must come to an end
But girl it isn't true
Each day with you I fall in love again
Everyday with you girl
Is sweeter than the day before
Everyday I love you more and more
More and more and more
And when I got to sleep at night time
Tomorrow's what I'm praying for
'Cause everyday with you girl
Is sweeter than the day before
