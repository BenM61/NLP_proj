It's just the same old song and dance, the same old song and dance,
Turns out you never cared at all, turns out you bound me like a ball,
Whoever thought i'd fall for the same old song and dance,
It's just the same old smooth routine, the same old moonlit scene,

Turns out you only used those eyes simply to tell me all those lies,
I really went king-size for the same old song and dance.
Me with a built-in radar, me with a cushion hard,
Winding up number one on the all-time loser's card.

I should forget you but i won't, should hate you but i don't,
It didn't turn out like i planned but if you smile and wave your hand,
I'd go out and hire a band, and wait for one more chance,
At the same old song and dance.

It didn't turn out just like i planned,
But if you smile and wave your lily white hand,
I'd go out and hire a band, then wait for one more chance,
At the same old, same old song and dance.
