There's an ant crawling up your back in the nighttime
There's an ant crawling up your back in the nighttime
But you think that's okay while you're sleeping

That ant crawled in your head in the nighttime
That ant crawled in your head in the nighttime
But you think that's okay while you're sleeping

Someday, that ant, he will grow up to be President
Someday, that ant, he will grow up to be President
But you think that's okay while you're sleeping

The President calls your name in the nighttime
The President calls your name in the nighttime
And that will spoil your dreams, while you're sleeping.

The men ransack your house in the nighttime
The men ransack your house in the nighttime
As the ant crawls up your back while you're sleeping
