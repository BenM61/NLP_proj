Baby sings the blues, for you
She may get happy  later
Baby cries  for comfort
For something to surround her

And when she sings it
You believe her 
How everyone she ever knew 
Would leave her spinning 'round
All on fire

Another wild hearted woman
Another child with the stars in her eyes
A wild hearted woman
And she's falling, falling

Baby's lost her soul, to you
Call her a fallen angel
Stormy weather forever
With every friend a stranger 

Lost little girl
In hurricanes of love and pain
Locked in her world
Of daisy chains and love and pain
Trying to find peace of mind

Another wild hearted woman
