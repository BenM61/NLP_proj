Up in the streets of Harlem, 110th and Park
That's where my baby waits for me, there in the dark
And I'm going, going, going, going, going, gonna tell her, tonight

Oh baby, don't wait for me I've got to go now
Baby, don't you see we've got to show now
That this world is much too slow now

Up in the streets of Harlem (Harlem), 100th, 25th
They say we always swing there what a lie what a myth
And I'm going, going, going, going, going, gonna tell her, tonight

Oh baby, don't turn your back on me I'm leaving
I've gotta fight for what I believe in
Don't want no more of hate and grievin'

You know that I love you, but I'm going away
From the streets, the streets of Harlem
From the streets, the streets of Harlem

Up in the streets of Harlem (Harlem), the tenements and the dirt
I see my baby's face there full of shame, full of hurt
And I'm going, going, going, going, going, gonna tell her, tonight

Oh baby, please let me go, my friends are dyin'
I can't sleep 'cause I know they're tryin'
To keep the little ones from cryin'

In the streets, the streets of Harlem
In the streets, the streets of Harlem
In the streets, the streets of Harlem
