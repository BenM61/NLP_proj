name: "Blasco" Rossi(Vasco Rossi):
La combriccola del blasco 
Si è fermata dentro a un bosco 
Che nessuno aveva voglia di abitare 
Fu così che per dispetto 
Che qualcuno da su un...tetto 
Tutto a un tratto! da sul tetto...si mise a urlare! 
Guardate l'animale!... 
Guardate l'animaaaleeeeeeee

La combriccola del blasco 
Era poco più di un pugno 
Ma se si stringeva colpiva molto duro 
Fu così che per non fare 
Per non fare troppo male 
Lasciò il bosco per un posto, più sicuro

Magari un po' più buio 
Ma molto più sicuro 
Magari un po' più buio 
Ma molto più sicuuuurohohohohoh

La combriccola del blasco 
Era tutta gente a posto 
Ma qualcuno continuava a dirne male 
Si diceva che quel blasco 
Fosse stato prima un rospo 
Tramutato non so come e anche male 
In uno strano animale!... 
Con delle voglie strane 
Uno strano animale 
Con delle voglie straaaneeeeee

La combriccola del blasco 
Arrivati a questo punto 
Sparì dentro un buco profondo come il mare 
A vedere se quel tale 
Arrivava fin là in fondo 
Arrischiando, per lui stesso? d'affogare
Magari in mezzo al mare 
Per prender l'animale

Vieni già in fondo al mare 
A prender l'animale 
Vieni già in fondo al mare 
Che ti do l'animale

If that isn't funny
Well, watch out, teacher

Oh, oh, when the chamber's empty
She said: "Oh, oh, meet el Presidente."

Dress in flimsy clothing
Use your lipstick line
To cover fear and loathing
With a pink disguise
You never refuse when she lies back

Put a stripe on the union and a star on the jack
She's on the case at dinner time (At dinner time)
She's on the evening news (She's on the evening news)
And if you dare step out of line (Step out of line)

name: "Murder" He Says(Dinah Shore):
Finally found a fella
Almost completely divine
But his vocabulary
Is killin' this romance of mine
We get into an intimate situation
And then begins this Romeo's conversation

He says, "Murder," he says
Ev'ry time we kiss
He says, "Murder," he says
At a time like this
He says, "Murder," he says
Is that the language of love?

He says, "Solid," he says
Takes me in his arms
And says, "Solid," he says
Meanin' all my charms
He says, "Solid," he says
Is that the language of love?

He says, "Chick, chick, you torture me
Zoot! Are we livin'?"
I'm thinkin' o' leavin' him flat
He says, "Dig, dig, the jumps the old
Ticker is givin'"
Now, he can talk plainer than that

He says, "Murder,"' he says
Ev'ry time we kiss
He says, "Murder," he says
Keep it up like this
And that's, "Murder," he says
In that impossible tone
It will bring on nobody's murder but his own

He says, "Jackson," he says
And my name's Marie
He says, "Jackson," he says
'Shoot the snoot to me'
He says, "Jackson," he says
Is that the language of love?

He says, "Woof, woof," he says
When he likes my hat
He says, "Tsk, tsk," he says
What the heck is that?
He says, "Wooh, wooh," he says
Is that the language of love?

He says, "Hep, hep, with helium
Now babe, we're cookin'"
And other expressions to wit
He says, "We're in da groove
And da groove is good lookin'"
He sounds like his uppers don't fit

He says, "Murder"
He says, "Murder"
And the way he says, "Murder" 
In that impossible tone
I've told him over and over and over again
That it'll be nobody else's murder but his own

When'd you get down to my bones?
Where'll I find that wishing stone?
The beads, the records
All the calls, and the drinks alone

A fast distraction,
A strange fall forward-
My lame reaction.

name: #WHERESTHELOVE(Jamie Foxx):
People killin' people dyin'
Children hurtin', I hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preachin'?
Would you turn the other cheek again?
Mama, mama, mama, tell us what the hell is goin' on
Can't we all just get along?
Father, father, father help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me
Questioning
(Where's the love)

Yo what's going on with the world, momma
(Where's the love)
Yo people living like they ain't got no mommas
(Where's the love)
I think they all distracted by the drama and
Attracted to the trauma, mamma
(Where's the love)
I think they don't understand the concept or
The meaning of karma
(Where's the love)

Overseas, yeah they trying to stop terrorism
(Where's the love)
Over here on the streets the police shoot
The people put the bullets in 'em
(Where's the love)
But if you only got love for your own race
(Where's the love)
Then you're gonna leave space for others to discriminate
(Where's the love)

And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate then you're bound to get irate
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how hate works and operates
Man, we gotta set it straight
Take control of your mind and just meditate
And let your soul just gravitate
To the love, so the whole world celebrate it

People killin' people dyin'
Children hurtin', I hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preachin'?
Would you turn the other cheek again?
Mama, mama, mama, tell us what the hell is goin' on
Can't we all just get along?
Father, Father, Father help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning
(Where's the love)

It just ain't the same, always in change
(Where's the love)
New days are strange, is the world insane?
(Where's the love)
Nation droppin' bombs killing our little ones
(Where's the love)
Ongoing suffering as the youth die young
(Where's the love)

Where's the love when a child gets murdered
Or a cop gets knocked down
Black lives not now
Everybody matter to me
All races, y'all don't like what I'm sayin'? Haterade, tall cases
Everybody hate somebody
Guess we all racist
Black Eyed Peas do a song about love and y'all hate this
All these protests with different colored faces
We was all born with a heart
Why we gotta chase it?
And every time I look around

Every time I look up, every time I look down
No one's on a common ground
(Where's the love)
And if you never speak truth then you never know how love sounds
(Where's the love)
And if you never know love then you never know God, wow
(Where's the love)
Where's the love y'all? I don't, I don't know
Where's the truth y'all? I don't know

People killin' people dyin'
Children hurtin', I hear them cryin'
Could you practice what you preach?
Would you turn the other cheek?
Father, Father, Father help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning
(Where's the love)
(Where's the love)

Love is the key
(Where's the love)
Love is the answer
(Where's the love)
Love is the solution
(Where's the love)
(Where's the love)
They don't want us to love
(Where's the love)
Love is powerful
(Where's the love)
(Where's the love)

My mama asked me why I never vote never vote
'Cause police men want me dead and gone (Dead and gone)
That election looking like a joke (Such a joke)
And the weed man still sellin' dope
Somebody gotta give these niggas hope (Please hope)
All he ever wanted was a smoke (My gosh)
Said he can't breathe with his hands in the air
Layin' on the ground died from a choke
(Where's the love)

I feel the weight of the world on my shoulders
As I'm gettin' older y'all people gets colder
Most of us only care about money makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinemas
What happened to the love and the values of humanity?
(Where's the love)
What happened to the love and the fairness and equality?
(Where's the love)
Instead of spreading love we're spreading animosity
(Where's the love)
Lack of understanding leading us away from unity
(Where's the love)

name: 'Disco' la Passione(Chris Rea):
I stand alone
Without a care
Open the door
But no-one's there
The lonely night
My only friend
Love's wrongs are right
I can't defend

What I've become
It haunts me so

I know the pain inside
Is the price you pay to ride
Into the brightest flame
Never the same again

name: 'O Mare E Tu(Andrea Bocelli):
Sentir em nos 
Sentir em nos 
Ulma razao 
Para nao ficarmos sos 
E nesse abraco forte 
Sentir o mar 
Na nossa voz 
Chorar como quem sonha 
Sempre navegar 
Nas velas rubras deste amor 
Ao onge a barca louca perde o norte
 
Amore mio 
Si nun ce stess 'o mare e tu 
Nun ce stesse manch'io 
Amore mio 
L'amore esiste quanno nuje 
Stamme vicino a dio 
Amore 
 
No teu alhar 
Um espelho de agua 
A vida a navegar 
Por entre sonho e a magoa 
Sem um adeus sequer
E namsamente 
Talvez no mar 
Eu veita em espuma encontre 
O sol do teu olhar
Voga ao de leve, meu amor 
Ao longe a barca nua 
A lodo o pano
 
Amore mio 
Si nun ce stess'o mare e tu 
Nun ce stesse manch'io 
Amore mio 
L'amore esiste quanno nuje 
Stamme vicino a dio 
Amore

name: 'Round Midnight(Ella Fitzgerald):
It begins to tell 'round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well till after sundown
Supper time I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad 'round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it too

When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending?
Darlin', I need you; lately I find
You're out of my heart and I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings 'round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing for your returning
Till our love is safe and sound
And old midnight comes around

Feelin' sad really gets bad
'Round, 'round, 'round midnight

Just you alone filled me with ah

You've made my life so glamorous
You can't blame me for feeling amorous

There ain't nothing I can do
Or nothing I can say
That folks don't criticize me

But I'm going to do
Just as I want to anyway
And don't care just what people say

If I should take a notion
To jump into the ocean
Ain't nobody's business if I do

If I go to church on Sunday
Then cabaret all day Monday
Ain't nobody's business if I do

If my man ain't got no money
And I say "Take all of mine, honey"
Ain't nobody's business if I do

If I give him my last nickel
And it leaves me in a pickle
Ain't nobody's business if I do

Well, I'd rather my man would hit me
Than follow him to jump up and quit me
Ain't nobody's business if I do

I swear, I won't call no copper
If I'm beat up by my papa
Ain't nobody's business if I do

Nobody's business
Ain't nobody's business
Nobody's business if I do

Every time I feel alone
I can blame it on you
And I do, oh
You've got me like a loaded gun
Golden sun and sky so blue

But we both know you left me no choice

[Chorus]
(chaque fois que tu ton va)
You just bring me down
(je pretend que tu fais bien)
So I'm counting my tears 'til I get over you

Sometimes I watch the world go by
I wonder what it's like
To wake up every single day
Smile on your face
You never tried
We both know we can't change it
But we both know we'll just have to face it

[Chorus]

If only I could give you up
But would I want to let you off of this soapbox baby?
We both know that we want it
But we both know you left me no choice

Through laughter and through tears.

So, take my heart in sweet surrender,
And tenderly say that I'm,
The one you love and live for,
Till the end of time.

name: 'Twas the Night After Christmas(Jeff Foxworthy):
Twas the night after Christmas and all through the trailer
The beer had gone flat and the pizza was staler
The tube socks hung empty, no candies or toys
I was camped out on my old La-Z-Boy

The kids they weren't talking to me or my wife
The worst Christmas they said they had had in their lives
My wife couldn't argue and neither could I
So I watched TV and my wife, she just cried

When out in the yard the dog started barkin'
I stood up and looked and saw Sheriff Larkin
He yelled, "Roy I am sworn to uphold the laws
And I got a complaint from a feller named Clause"

I said, "Clause, I don't know nobody named Clause
And you ain't takin me in without probable cause"
Then the Sheriff he said, "The man was shot at last night"
I said, "That might've been me, just what's he look like?

The Sheriff replied, "Well he's a jolly old feller, with a big beer gut belly
That shakes when he laughs like a bowl full of jelly
He sports a long beard and a nose like a cherry"
I said, "That sounds like my wife's sister Sherri"

"It's no time for jokes Roy," the Sheriff he said
"The man I'm describing is dressed all in red
I'm here for the truth now, it's time to come clean
Tell me what you done, and tell me what you seen"

Well I started to lie then I thought what the hell
It wouldn't be the first time I spent New Years in jail
I said, "Sheriff it happened last night about ten
I thought that my wife had been drinking again"

When she walked in from works she was white as a ghost
I thought maybe she'd seen one of them UFO's
But she said that a bunch of deer had just flown over her head
And stopped on the roof of our good neighbor Red

Well I ran outside to look and the sight made me shutter
A freezer full of venison standing right on Red's gutter
Well, my hands were a shaking as I grabbed my gun
When outta Red's chimney this feller did run

And slung on his back was this bag overflowin'
I thought he'd stolen Red's stuff while old Red was out bowlin'
So I yelled, "Drop it fat boy, hands in the air"
But he went about his business like he hadn't a care

So I popped off a warning shot over his head
Well he dropped that bag and he jumped in that sled
And as he flew off I heard him extort
"that's assault with intent Roy, I'll see you in court. "I'll tell you what sheriff if you put a subnet"
On me I won't show up ill hold up in the cellar
And you'll never rout me outta there
So why don't you just
Turn car off come
In well watch wrestling eat some
Easter bunny stew and talk about howta catch that tooth fairy
She's been over here about every other night

name: 'Twas the Night Before Christmas(Perry Como):
It was the night before Christmas
When all through the house
Not a creature was stirring
Not even a mouse

The stockings all hung
By the chimney with care
In hopes that St. Nicholas
Soon would be there

The children were nestled
All safe in their beds
While visions of sugarplums
Danced in their heads

And mom in her kerchief
And I in my cap
Had just settled down
For a long winter's nap

When out on the lawn
There arose such a clatter
I sprang from my bed
To see what was the matter

Away to the window
I flew like a flash
Tore open the shutters
And threw up the sash

The moon on the breast
Of the new fallen snow
Gave the lustre of midday
To object below

When what to my wandering eyes
Should appear
But a miniature sleigh
And eight tiny reindeer

With a little ol' driver
So lively and quick
I knew in a moment
It must be St. Nick

More rapid than eagles
His courses they came
As he whistled and shouted
And called them by name

And quot, now dasher
Now dancer
Now prancer
Now vixen

On comet
On cupid
On doner
An' blitzen' and quot

To the top of the porch
To the top of the wall
Now dash away, dash away
Dash away all

As dry leaves
Before the wild hurricane fly
When they meet with an obstacle
Mount to the sky

So, up to the housetop
The courses they flew
With a sleigh full of toys
And St. Nicholas too

And then in a twinkling
I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing
Of each little hoof

As I drew in my head
And was turning around
Down the chimney St. Nicholas
Came with a bound

He was dressed all in fur
From his head to his foot
And his clothes were all tarnished
With ashes and soot

A bundle of toys
He had flung on his back
And he looked like a peddler
Just opening his pack

His eyes how they twinkled
His dimples how merry
His cheeks were like roses
His nose like a cherry

His drawl little mouth
Was drawn up like a bow
And the beard of his chin
Was a white as the snow

The stump of his pipe
He held tight in his teeth
And the smoke it encircled his head
Like a wreath

He had a broad face
And a round little belly
That shook when he laughed
Like a bowl full of jelly

He was chubby and plump
A right jolly old elf
I laughed when I saw him
In spite of myself

A wink of his eye
And a twist of his head
Soon gave me to know
I had nothing to dread

He spoke not a word
But went straight to his work
And filled all the stockings
Then turned with a jerk

An' laying a finger
Along side his nose
An' giving a nod
Up the chimney he rose

He sprang to his sleigh
To his team gave a whistle
An' away they all flew
Like the down of a thistle

But I heard him exclaim
As he drove out of sight
And quot, Happy Christmas to all
And to all a goodnight and quot

Hm

You turned my world around

Is how good we are together
And I never want to see it slip away
I'll never let you go
It's all I know

Hold me 
Love as you rush to me
Is telling me
Let's put our hearts in the hands of fate
Time will tell us
It what we've got was worth the wait
And there's a fire 
That's been burning deep inside of me
And I don't need nobody else 
'Cause now you're here with me
You turned my world around

All I know 
Is it feels like forever
All I know 
Is I love the way it feels
All I see  
Is how good we are together
And I never want to see it slip away
I'll never let you go
Its all I know

I might have never met you
In another time or place
Now I never could forget you
I could never walk away

It's all I know

'Cause there's a place inside my heart
That nobody's touched before
And when I found you 
I found all that I've been searching for
You turned my world around

[Chorus x3]

name: (And She Said) Take Me Now(Janet Jackson):
What you waiting for?
I know you're watching me
Hey boy, come on and take me now

What you waiting for?
I know you're watching me
Hey boy, come on and take me now

Can I talk to you for a minute
You've been looking all night for your shining star
Well baby here I am, so why you waiting?
Step on over, let me show you how bad you are

Just let me take the lead
All you gotta do is let your mind be free
Lets hit the floor and cause a scene
Get real wet if you know what I mean
What you say baby?

(And she said)
Show me how
You got me working, honey

(And she said)
So take me now
Boy you make me feel like I gotta dance

I gotta dance, gotta dance baby, I gotta dance

I feel good to you, you try to hide it
And I can tell by the way you push up close to me
Your body temperature, is arising
Something's going down as far as I can see

Just let me take the lead
All you gotta do is let your mind be free
Lets hit the floor and cause a scene
Get real wet if you know what I mean
What you say baby?
