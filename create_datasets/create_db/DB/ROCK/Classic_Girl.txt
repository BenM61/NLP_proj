In my neighborhood,
When shots go off,
No one bothers. 
A POP, and a reply POP, and no reply

Dinosaurs on the quilt I wore
With a girl. 
Such a classic girl, 
Such a classic girl, 
Such a classic girl

Gives her man great ideas. 
Hears you tell your friends, 
Hey man, listen to my great idea!
It's true I am a villain
When you fall ill, 
that's probably because

Men never can be. 
Not like a girl. 
A classic girl, 
Such a classic girl

They may say, Those were the days,,
But in a way,
You know for us these are the days. 
Yes, for us these are the days

And you know you're my girl! 
Such a classic girl, 
Such a classic girl

Yeah for us these are the days
