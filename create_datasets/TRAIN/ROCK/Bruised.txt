Don't you worry about me, I'm yours to keep now
Don't you worry about me, I will live through this and more
I have no other side
The bruises caught me up shy
The bitter taste of a lie
I can't explain all the love I feel when I'm yours

The bruises caught me up shy
The bitter taste of a lie
I can't explain all the love I feel when I'm yours

Don't you worry about me, I've been used before
Don't you worry about me, I'm the rain and you're the sea
I have no other side
The bruises caught me up shy
The bitter taste of a lie
I can't explain all the love I feel when I'm yours

The bruises caught me up shy
The bitter taste of a lie
I can't explain all the love I feel when I'm yours

The bruises caught me up shy
The bitter taste of a lie
I can't explain all the love I feel when I'm yours
