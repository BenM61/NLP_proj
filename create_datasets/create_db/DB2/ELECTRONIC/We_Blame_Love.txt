It couldn't be clearer
I'll apologise right now
In spectacular language
I think you'll understand somehow
If I need to reach you
We've got to walk a path where love's forgotten

(love) diamond skin and clear blue eyes that never see
(love) every past needs broken time
Remind me how it used to be
(we blame love) heart is beating, mind is thinking
Body's moving
(we blame love) don't say another thing
It's dangerous it's deadly just like...

The secret is out
Beyond belief eternally
Naked and recognised
You see I'm just a boy who can't say...

(love) is the purest energy
In my philosophy
(love) every past needs broken time
Remind me how it used to be

(we blame love) fascination, strange attraction
Chain reaction
(we blame love) for we are wild for truth
It's dangerous it's deadly just like...

It's just a clever trick
I know, bewitching me
But seeing you clouds my eyes
And if it rains then let it rain on me

(love) diamond skin and clear blue eyes that never see
(love) every past needs broken time
Remind me how it used to be

(we blame love) heart is beating, mind is thinking
Body's moving
(we blame love) I haven't seen your face today
It's dangerous it's deadly just like...

(we blame love) fascination, strange attraction
Chain reaction
(we blame love) for we are wild for truth
It's dangerous it's deadly just like...

Love
The saving of your life
A million times a second
The father of invention

Remind me how it used to be

(we blame love) fascination, strange attraction
Chain reaction
(we blame love) oh let it rain on me
It's dangerous it's deadly just like...

She's a real space slipper in an
Atomic graveyard she's got
Personal radar she is
Face to face electronically with
Me. I'm a living specimen
A single wing of a broken bird cries
Love
We're safe here in the past
Don't say another thing
I can't just pretend
The memory has left me
Your cold hand warm against my skin
A misinterpretation of tears
A freaky kind of nature
The world's gone mad - and I have
