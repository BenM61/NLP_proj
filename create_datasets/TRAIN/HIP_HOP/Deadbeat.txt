Row of baddies
Daddy issues
Taking Xanny, shit'll kill you
All my crew
But we always miss you

RIP
You know I miss you

I love them dope boys
Sip on that lean
F*ck 'em all
To the indie iron
Love the gold teeth
Saying "all me"
Didn't know the whole me
Boy, I was a beast

I'ma leave you
I'ma leave you like a deadbeat
I'ma leave you
I'ma leave you like a deadbeat
I'ma leave you like a deadbeat
Dead

None of my crew got a father figure
But all of my crew make a father figure
The bigger the figure
The more that they listen
They listen and figures
They seeing a vision

Young Oprah on the track
Grew up in a trailer singing peppermints
Just like all the money Daddy sent them to the track
Now, I'm talking on this track
Tell you where I'm really at
What that mean
I've been hanging, building
Now I'll never call you back

I'ma leave you
I'ma leave you like a deadbeat
I'ma leave you
I'ma leave you like a deadbeat
I'ma leave you like a deadbeat
Dead

Dead
Dead
Dead
I'ma leave you like a deadbeat
Dead
Dead
Dead
I'ma leave you like a deadbeat

Back at it with my bad bitches
Back at it with my bae, yeah
Back at it with my bad bitches
So I'ma leave you like a deadbeat
Dead
