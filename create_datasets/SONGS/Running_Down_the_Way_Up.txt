Below, the center's in me 
Revolve around 
Derive a meaning 
From my self will 
As I watch the sun highlight your Midas touch 
Conscious light gets through somehow 
Yet I always fail to notice 
Yet I always fail to notice 
I'm always heading for the ground 

Running down the way up 

The visible effect runs through my blood 
As I watch the sun highlight your Midas touch 
Conscious light gets through somehow 
I always fail to notice 
I'm heading for the ground 

Has desire found a shady avenue? 
(Standing up below with me) 
Has desire found a shady avenue? 
(Standing up below with me) 
And I always fail to notice 
Yet I always fail to notice 

Always running down the way up 
And you're standing there 
(Running down) 
Always running down the way up 
And you're standing there 
(Running down) 
Always running down the way up 
And you're standing there 
(Running down) 
Always running down the way up 
And you're standing there 
And if we doubt, we can hardly hope to shine 
And the sun could eventually be outshone 

Always running down the way up 
And you're standing there 
(Running down) 
Always running down the way up 
And you're standing there 
(Running down) 
Always running down the way up 
And you're standing there 
(Running down) 
Always running down the way up 
And you're standing there 

(the way up) 

And conscious light gets through somehow 
Yet I fail to notice 
That I'm heading for the ground 

Running down the way up 

Always running down the way up 
And you're standing there 

(the way up)
