The muffin man is seated at the table
In the laboratory of the utility muffin Research kitchen.
Reaching for an oversized chrome spoon,
He gathers an Intimate quantity of dried muffin
Remnants and brushing his scapular aside,
Procceds to dump these inside of his shirt...
He turns to us and speaks:

"Some people like cupcakes better.
I for one care less for them!"

Arrogantly twisting the sterile canvas 
Snoot of a fully charged icing anointment utensil,
He 'poot's forths a quarter-ounce green rosette,
- oh ah yuk, yuk... let's try that again...! -
He 'poots' forth a quarter-ounce green rosette
Near the summit of a dense,
But radiant muffin of his own design.
Later he says:

"Some people... some people like cupcakes
Exclusively, while myself, I say,
There is naught nor ought there be nothing 
So exalted on the face of god's grey
Earth as that prince of foods... the muffin!"

Girl you thought he was a man,
But he was a muffin,
He hung around till you found,
That he didn't know nuthin',

Girl you thought he was a man,
But he only was a-puffin',
No cries is heard in the night,
As a result of him stuffin',
