I'm totally confused by you
I'm totally confused by you

Ten foot man
Makin' my lunch
You'll never understand
I want you so much

And I never never want it
And I never never want it
And I never never want it
And I never never want it

I'm totally confused by you
I'm totally confused by you

Screamin' in my face
Whisper in my ear
Put me in a suitcase
With the can of beer

And I never never want it
And I never never want it
And I never never want it
And I never never want it
