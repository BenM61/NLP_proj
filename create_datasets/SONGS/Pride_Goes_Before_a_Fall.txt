Might as well admit it you don't really love me
You've been acting funny for so long
It hurts to think that you think you're above me
But it hurts more to admit that I've been wrong

Need a bottle and a table I can find those
Maybe they will help speed up time's crazy crawl
Might as well go around and join the winos ain't it funny how pride goes before a fall
Yes pride goes before a fall I've got a feeling

That I'm gonna seek much more than them all
When we first met I lived way above the city
Ain't it funny how pride goes before a fall
Pour the wine dim the lights and play the jukebox

Dance with every Sue and Betty that's around
Take her out and try your luck that's what's expected
What's the difference it can't bring your honour down
You are now a full fledged member of the rat race

Forget everything that's decent have a ball
What's the difference if you die in this old bad place
Ain't it funny how pride goes before a fall
(What's the difference if you die in this old bad place)

Ain't it funny how pride goes before a fall
