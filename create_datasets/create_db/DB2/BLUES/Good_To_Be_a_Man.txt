It's good to be a man these days
Don't have no conscious about my evil ways
Don't ever feel bad for the awful things I say
It's good to be a man these days

To be a man would be serene
Drinking beer till I get mean
Chewing tobacco, kissing girls like life's a dream
To be a man would be serene

And I bet it gets tiring
Always having to be right
Well I'd love to be a cheating man
To fill those lonely nights

To be a man would be just fine
My only worry would be my receding hair line
I only give love that's on my own time
To be a man would be just fine

To be a man would be damn good
I'd do dumb things cause I should
Getting stuck in a ditch like my woman knew I would
To be a man would be damn good

It's good to be a man these days
It's good to be a man these days 
It's good to be a man these days 
It's good to be a man these days
