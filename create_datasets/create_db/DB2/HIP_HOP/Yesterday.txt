Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it seems as though they're here to stay
Oh I believe in yesterday

Suddenly, I'm not half the man I use to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh yesterday came suddenly

Why she had to go, I don't know
She wouldn't say, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong now I long for yesterday

Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh I believe in yesterday

I believe in yesterday
Why she had to go I don't know
She would not say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh I believe in yesterday
I believe in yesterday
Was so far away
Oh yesterday was far away
And I know I can't turn back
'Cause yesterday's gone
