Whenever I feel afraid, I hold my head erect
And whistle a happy tune so no one will suspect I'm afraid
While shivering in my shoes, I strike a careless pose
And whistle a happy tune and no one ever knows I'm afraid
The result of this deception is very strange to tell,
For when I fool the people I fear, I fool myself as well
I whistle a happy tune, and every single time,
The happiness in the tune convinces me that I'm not afraid
Make believe you're brave, and the trick will take you far,
You may as brave as you make believe you are
(whistle)
You may as brave as you make believe you are
The result of this deception is very strange to tell,
For when I fool the people I fear, I fool myself as well
I whistle a happy tune, and every single time,
The happiness in the tune convinces me that I'm not afraid
Make believe you're brave, and the trick will take you far,
You may as brave as you make believe you are
(whistle)
You may as brave as you make believe you are
