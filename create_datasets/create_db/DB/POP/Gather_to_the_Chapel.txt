Your photo all over the altar
Your friends dressed in black
It's the first time I've seen you in ages
Hold on, my old time bomb

Everyone gather to the chapel, to the chapel
Everyone gather to the chapel, to the chapel
Everyone loved you, yes everyone
Everyone gather to the chapel, to the chapel

I walk through the park where we hung out
Saw signs long ago
Try hard not to argue the obvious
Hold on, my long time partner

Everyone gather to the chapel, to the chapel
Everyone gather to the chapel, to the chapel
Everyone loved you, yes everyone
Everyone gather to the chapel, to the chapel

You left us in the dark to cry
Why
Everyone gather to the chapel, to the chapel
Everyone gather to the chapel, to the chapel
Everyone loved you, yes everyone
Everyone gather to the chapel, to the chapel
