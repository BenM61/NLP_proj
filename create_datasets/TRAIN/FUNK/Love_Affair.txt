Well, I just finish this letter and
I hope it finds you in good health, in love, so

Hello my love, I'm feeling fine, how are you?
Every minute seems eternal but I'll stay true
What I'm going through over you, thinking of you

Then just a week you've been gone, miss you dearly
True love, they say is healing with you near me
What I'm going through over you

I can't wait to hold you, see morning in your eyes
Can't wait to love you in loveless paradise
So I send you love by name, sealed with a kiss
Love, let it be the blame

Love affair
Love affair
Girl, I love you
I love you

(Incomprehensible), play the part, we grew stronger
We will always win its lovely hunger
What I'm going through over you, thinking of you

I hope your trip was easy, trouble free
So hurry, hold my angel onto me
What I'm going through over you

I can't wait to hold you, see morning in your eyes
Can't wait to love you in loveless paradise
So I send my love by name, sealed with a kiss, baby
Love, let it be the blame

Love affair
Love affair
Girl, I love you
I love you

You and me, forever angel
You and me, love affair
You and me together forever
Love dreams
