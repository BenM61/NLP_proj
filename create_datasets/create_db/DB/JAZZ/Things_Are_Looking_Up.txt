If I should suddenly start to sing,
Or stand on my head, or anything,
Don't think that I've lost my senses,
It's just that my happiness finally commences!

The long, long ages of dull despair
Are turning into thin air,
And it seems that suddenly I've
Become the happiest man alive.

Things are looking up.
I've been looking the landscape over,
And it's covered with four-leaf clovers.
Oh, things are looking up
Since love looked up at me.

Bitter was my cup,
But no more will I be the mourner,
For I've certainly turned the corner.
Oh, things are looking up,
Since love looked up at me

See the sunbeams?
Every one beams
Just because of you.
Love's in session
And my depression
Is unmistakably through

Things are looking up,
It's a great little world we live in.
Oh, I'm as happy as a pup
Since love looked up at me.
