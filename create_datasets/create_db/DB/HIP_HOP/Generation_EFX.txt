Biggidee back from vacation 
Here to rock the whole nation 
Diggie Das EPMD invation 
Down diffa don  down diffa do  wiggidee one two 
Til we do  wiggidee rock the Fubu 
The official  launch the missile 
Blow the whistle at the art official 
Miggidee mix sure to South Central 
Forget you  like amnesia  biggidee 'bove the reefa 
Cheap  but Das came to please ya 
Take the Bever, now we back son, tougher action 
Zoom Das, zoom Das, satisfaction 
Biggidee back pop popular, hip hoppin' 'em 
The Hit Squad, Def Squad still rockin' 'em 

It's everytime we rock a bomb, we get ya mind open 

The mic's blazin', smokin', he was chokin' 
We don't remove walls, boom Docks, plus the sua 
We bring it to ya, we nightmare like Freddy Krueger 
So call me drama, trauma, slash comma, no one to bomba 
E-tracks like ?, from Def Jam 
The East West check my streetbreath, no weak steps 
Or rest with the ?, check my repetoir 
Mangin' on the reservoir, I'm eatin' caviar 
Ey yo I'm really try to do this far 
EPMD and Das Efx cold blazin' it, no face in it 
Got the whole world chasin' it, the scream show up 
Never rock you like my boa, the ill flow up 
Came back cause we knowed ya, another go round 
Grab the mic, put the flow down, you court mo' 
G minus 7, we 'bout to bring now 

[Chorus: x2] 
Represent my, generation! 
Here we go, all we want to do is flow 
All we know is get the dough 

Diggidee yes yes yo, to the beat yo 
No matter what the game, before you walk you got to crawl 
Long term plannin', I make ya bounce like a Mars, line affects candy 
And let the music play like zany 
And feeds your eyes and what you never tought you see again 
Diggidee Das and nigga the EPMD again 
Ask the mildest skill, we built to puff trees and with ya now Hit 
Squad, Kansas 
The Diggidee suck D's, all my niggaz sqeeze, jiggaz get hot, we freeze 
Niggaz in the street keep figgaz, can't f*ck with these niggaz 
Show stop us, we off the baileys and the ruckus 
Dread not a rasta, I'll be back Asta 

What the deal is son, ain't this some shit? 
Caps frontin' for I even come out this bitch 
You forget who we are? Recognize, we spark the Benz 
Then split the game to the kids 
Now you want to act like my crew, never happen 
I've payed the way for rappin', last era 
You can say what you want, I sit back and front 
The money, the jewels, the hoe, clothes, YOU KNOW 
Friends and fools can tell ya so about the lyrical, spiritual 
More it's the miracle, fly individual, EPMD and Das Efx might checkin' it 

Side checkin' it! 

[Chorus: x2]
