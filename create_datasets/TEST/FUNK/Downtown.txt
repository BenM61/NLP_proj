Word got around that a nigga got shot
Heard a nigga drew down' and he bucked so his ass got popped
We was on my block trying to move these rocks
Trying to stack this cash on the low, gotta duck these cops
We was off third and polock chilling in the back of the tracks
Niggas got packs, trying to get them racks
X5 I was riding in the back with the brother's' round kicking in the gat in my lap
17 had no dreams, drinking four loco's, Sprite and codeine
First class I was so lean, said f*ck high-school, so I left Reed

No one told me life would be this way!
I swear nobody told me
Guess this is the game we chose to play
Crazy how it's always been the same!
People dying every day, that ain't nothing new
When you from downtown, downtown!
Out here tryna make a way
I won't let these niggas take me down-down, down!

Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em

Phone just rang heard a nigga got got
He was over in the East, last thing that he heard six shots
He ain't gettin' no love from the cops, nobody got caught
Real talk when I heard who it was, heart damn near stopped
Somebody done killed my brother, now I gotta get back
Let em know cause a nigga gotta feel that!
Sitting shotgun with the shot gun
When you hear the shots come, nigga don't run!
Already bad, it can only get worse
Hand full of steel cause the shit still hurts
Cut so deep when they put him in the hearse
Never saw 25, had to put him in the dirt

No one told me life would be this way!
I swear nobody told me
Guess this is the game we chose to play
Crazy how it's always been the same!
People dying every day, that ain't nothing new
When you from downtown, downtown!
Out here tryna make a way
I won't let these niggas take me down-down, down!

Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em

Once upon a time down town in a nine (9th ward)
Where they don't mind dying
Sworn to a life of crime, was a youngin' that only stood 5'5
Big money on his mind, clothes ain't wrinkled while his hands on his iron.
Shot six times right in front of my mom
Kind of 32, man, I'm lucky to survive
On that Pac juice real niggas don't die!
Bitch, I'm from A-town, slang crack on the same set
Blood stains there from a homie with his head cracked
O'Gs like A' wacks they'll be doing this shit way back since A track.
And we yell where the gang at
You can get fame there from the way you're going to bang that
Shoot for the head watch how you aim that
Price on your head and we gonna take that
It's about to go down, you ain't about this then you better go now
Sun going down, keep it going down!
Everybody lay down ski mask down!
All you gonna see is my eyes and my frown
Last thing you hear is my gun going pow
It happens every day round my way
This ain't nothing new you grew up downtown

People dying every day, that ain't nothing new
When you from downtown, downtown!
I'm just trying to make a way,
I won't let these niggas take me down-down, down!

Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
