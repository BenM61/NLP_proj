These days I find
I'm wasting my time
On all the little things
That shouldn't concern me

Weighing my heart
With such confused emotion
Letting anxiousness in
Where peace should prevail

It's just my humanity
Getting the better of me
It's just my humanity
Getting the better, getting the better of me

I've been working on it
Just trying and working on it
Knowing the soul to be lighter
If I could just shed this weight

Or just carry this weight
Without objection
So weight become lightness
And light becomes weightless

It's just my humanity
Getting the better of me
It's just my humanity
Getting the better, getting the better of me

I'm lifting
The lid off
Eventually
Holding my head up
And clarity
Where once there was proud

I know this place
And smile inside

Ooooh it's just my humanity
Getting the better of me
It's just my humanity
Getting the better, getting the better of me
It's just my humanity
Getting the better, getting the better of me

Getting the better, getting the better (getting the better), getting the better of me
It's just my humanity
Getting the better, getting the better of me
