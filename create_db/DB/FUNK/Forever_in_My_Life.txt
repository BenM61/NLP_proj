There comes a time in every man's life 
When he gets tired of fooling around 
Juggling hearts in a three ring circus 
Some day it will drive a body down to the ground

I never imagined that love would rain on me 
And make me want to settle down

Baby it's true
I think I do and I just want to tell you that 
I want to with you and baby if you do too
Oh, forever, forever

Baby I want you forever 
I want to keep you for the rest of my life
All that's wrong in my world you can make right
You are my savior, you are my light
Forever I want you in my life (la-da-da-da-da-da-da)
 
La-da-da-da-da-da
(Every man's journey) there comes a road in every man's journey (don't be afraid)
That he is afraid to walk on his own (I'm at that road)
I'm here to tell you that I'm at that road 
And I'd rather walk it with you than walk it alone 

Ho, ho, you are my hero, you are my future
When I am with you I have no past
Oh baby my one and only desire 
Is find some way in this doggone world to make this feeling last

Oh baby it's true I know I do and I just want to tell you 
That I want to with you, yeah and baby if you do too, oh

Forever, forever I want you baby, baby forever
I want to keep you for the rest of my life (you are my savior, you are my light)
All that's wrong in my world you can make right (forever I want you in my life)
You are my savior you are my light, forever I want you in my life (la-da-da-da-da-da)

Forever I want you in my life (la-da-da-da-da-da)
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da
I want you in my life
