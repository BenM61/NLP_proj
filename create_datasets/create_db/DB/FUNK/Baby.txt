Baby, slow down
Baby, slow down
Seems you're moving too fast for me
Baby, slow down
Seems you're moving too fast for me
Seem to be movin' a little too fast for me

Baby, slow down
I'm not gonna hurt you
I understand you never been here before
Someone has used you, making you so scared
Allow me to make it better, oh

[Chorus]
Baby, slow down
Seems you're moving too fast for me
Baby, slow down
Seems you're moving too fast for me
Seem to be movin' a little too fast for me

Baby stop runnin'
Please let me catch you
You're goin' through too many changes
But don't be scared to trust a stranger
I will assure you, there is no danger

[Chorus: x2]

What your friends say is fine
It don't mean a thing
When your heart beats next to mine
Take your time, baby slow it down
Cause we got forever

[Chorus: x2]

Break it down, break it down
Uh uh

Baby
Seems you're moving too fast
(Seems you're moving too fast)
Seems you're movin' too fast baby
Seems you're movin'
Seem to be movin a little to fast for me

[Repeats]
Seems you're movin' (Slow down)
Too fast for me
Seems you're movin'
Seem to be movin' a little too fast for me
