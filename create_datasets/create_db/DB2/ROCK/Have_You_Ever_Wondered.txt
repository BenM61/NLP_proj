Have you ever wondered what you would do
If the world was sweet and kindly exactly like you
Would you be afraid
Of what you got
Would you try to own a tree
Well you cannot

Tell me the fruit is yours grown off a tree
Tell me you grew and don't you see
You didn't grow it you're not the sun or the rain
And if you went away it would grow again

Sometimes I wonder
What it is I see
Is it the world around us
Baby or is it me
I lie awake wondering what went wrong
The world was ours for a song
