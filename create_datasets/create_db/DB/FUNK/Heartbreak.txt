I gotta respond, the money keep calling me
You know it be calling me

Now I can't prove my love

His love good, but your love's the best
And it only gets better so let's not forget

We at the Pablo show in the Kardashian row
With the Kardashians sipping the Kardashian show
We at the Pablo show, minks down to the floor
Got six bad bitches in the back of the row
We at the Pablo show
We at the Pablo show
The vibe is back

Now I can't prove my love
Heartbreak 101
At least stay here in my arms until the song's done
They say nothing lasts forever, but forever's always wrong
Now we're in that moment where you wanna do anything but go home
Na na na na
