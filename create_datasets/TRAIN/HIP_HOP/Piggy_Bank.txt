Clickity clank, clickity clank, the money goes into my piggy bank
Clickity clank, clickity clank, the money goes into my piggy bank

I'll get at you, my knife cut your skin
I'll get at you, blow shots at you man
I'll get at you, Tupac don't pretend
I'll get at you, I'll put that to an end

That damn shit is old, don't be screaming get at me dog
Have you running for your life when I'm at your bar
I get to waiving that semi like it's legal
A lil' nigga hurt his arm letting off that eagle
You know me, black on black Bentley, big ol' black 9
I'll clap yo monkey ass, your black on black crime
Big ol' chrome rims gleam, you know why I shine
C'mon man, you know how I shine
I'm in the hood, in a drop, Teflon vinyl top
Got a hundred guns a hundred clips, why I don't hear no shots?
That fat nigga thought "Lean Back" was "In Da Club"
My shit sold 11 mill, his shit was a dud
Jada don't f*ck with me if you want to eat
'Cause I'll do your little ass like Jay did Mobb Deep
Yea homie, in New York niggas like your vocals
But that's only New York dog, your ass is local

Clickity clank, clickity clank, the money goes into my piggy bank
Clickity clank, clickity clank, the money goes into my piggy bank

Yea, yea yea get more money, more money
Yea, yea yea get more money, more money
Yea, yea yea get more money, more money
Yea, yea yea get more money, more money

Banks' shit, sells, Buck's shit, sells
Game's shit, sells, I'm rich as, hell
Shyne poppin' off his mouth from a cell
He don't want it with me, he in PC
I could have a nigga run up on him with a shank
For just a few pennies out my piggy bank
Yayo bring the condoms, I'm in Room 203
Freak bitch look like Kim before the surgery
It's an emergency, when Michael Jackson see
Looked at a picture and says she looks like me
Kelis said her milkshake bring all the boys to the yard
Then Nas went, and tattooed the bitch on his arm
I mean like way out in Cali niggas know you, cuz
First thing they say about you is you's a sucker for love
This is chess not checkers, these are warning shots
After your next move I'll give you what I got

Clickity clank, clickity clank, the money goes into my piggy bank
Clickity clank, clickity clank, the money goes into my piggy bank

Yea, yea yea get more money, more money
Yea, yea yea get more money, more money
Yea, yea yea get more money, more money
Yea, yea yea get more money, more money

I'll get at you, I'll punch out your grill
I'll get at you, let off that blue steel
I'll get at you, nigga I'm for real
I'll get at you, get yo ass killed

Yea! Yea, y'all niggas gotta do something now man,
All that shoot 'em up shit y'all been talking,
You gotta do something baby! I mean,
I mean c'mon man everybody's listening
Nigga everybody listening
I know you ain't gonna just let 50 do you like that,
I mean damn rep yo hood nigga
Nigga you hard right? Pop off
Yayo get Marks and them niggas on the phone,
Tell them niggas I said grip up.
Niggas got a green light on these monkeys
