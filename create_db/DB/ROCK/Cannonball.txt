Check check check
One two

Spitting in a wishing well
Blown to hell crash
I'm the last splash

I know you little libertine
I know you're a real coocoo

Want you coocoo cannonball
Want you coocoo cannonball
In the shade, in the shade
In the shade, in the shade

I know you little libertine
I know you're a cannonball

I'll be your whatever you want
The bong in this reggae song

In the shade, in the shade
Want you coocoo cannonball
Want you coocoo cannonball

Spitting in a wishing well
Blown to hell
Crash
I'm the last splash

I'll be your whatever you want
The bong in this reggae song

Want you coocoo cannonball
Want you coocoo cannonball
In the shade, in the shade
In the shade, in the shade
