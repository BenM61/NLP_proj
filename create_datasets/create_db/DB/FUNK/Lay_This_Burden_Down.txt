I know I'm headed in the wrong direction
'Couse I'm weak from the lack of a passion
I've been afraid to acusing my darling
'Couse I didn't wanna lose my babe
I've been known about you other love a long time
Given you a chance to make up your mind

But
Tear stains on my pillowcase
Tells me not to hesitate
I've got lay this burden down

It's grip on my heart, I've got to shake it
Hang around another boy, I've got to make it
I've got to get away so I won't be save
The things that make me weaker and fall deeper
I've made up my mind to make a change
My whole life, to rearrange

'Couse
Tear stains on my pillowcase
Tells me not to hesitate
I've got lay this burden down
