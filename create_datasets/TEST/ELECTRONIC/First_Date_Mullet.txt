We should have started the first day we met
Now you're sleeping by my
Side yeah by my side
Oh, I can't stand it
Why 

I guess we were dancing the same way
In this empty classroom,
Waste to the time of life
Oh, I can't ?

I feel like a homeless kid when you're away
Pull on my old flashy shoes to feel OK.

We should this started the first day we met, now you're sleeping by my
Side, yeah, by my side
Oh, I can't stand it

I feel like a homeless kid when you're away
Put on my old flashy shoes to feel OK.

I feel like a homeless kid when you're away, pull on my old flashy shoes to feel OK
I feel like a homeless kid when you're away
Now I'm grown up, anything that you might stay
