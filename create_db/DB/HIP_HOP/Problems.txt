If lovin' me is wrong, I don't wanna be right then, bitch you hatin'
I'm never wrong, one time thought I was wrong, bitch I was only mistaken
I live all alone, little house, telephone, talk to you later
I'm never home, one time I thought I was home it was only the matrix

Off button
Pause button
Stop button
Lock button
Belly button
Big old tittiess, she pop buttons
Head butting
Versace button down unbuttoned to the top button
Percosets that's my buttons
Hit the pop button
Psychopath
Blunt big
Big as Mama June off the diet plan
Smoking science lab
I should have tattoo that say "I'm not like my dad"
Jesus Christ, amen
My hand psychic's hand
She see righteous plans
I see business plans, then I lose my mind and my attention span
She see empty hands like, ooh lordy
Smelling like Cool Water
Just got the new Cartier
The Rollie was too salty
That's rich nigga problems, avoid it
My little bitch body a trophy
Naked pics, five in the morning
Sunglasses smile emoji
Pull up on the opps, surprise party
Better get up and stand up like Bob Marley
That is your homie he died for ya
Check your home screen that's god calling (brr, hello?)
Making an impact my nigga
We not just black, nigga
We rich and black, nigga
And all them bitches they been after niggas
They run away then they come live with black nigga
Amen, feeling like Our Father
Should I get off my high horse?
To get on my flying horses
That's rich nigga problems, avoid it
My lil' bitch body'll solve it
And when you say timber please will you whisper 
My nigga I'm quietly falling

If lovin' me is wrong, I don't wanna be right then, bitch you hatin'
I'm never wrong, one time thought I was wrong, bitch I was only mistaken
I live all alone, little house, telephone, talk to you later
I'm never home, one time I thought I was home it was only the matrix
Rich nigga, rich nigga, rich nigga, rich nigga 
That's rich nigga problems, avoid it
Rich nigga problems, avoid it
That's rich nigga problems, avoid it
That's rich nigga problems, avoid it
Rich nigga, rich nigga, rich nigga, rich nigga 
If lovin' me is wrong, I don't wanna be right then, bitch you hatin'
I'm never wrong, one time thought I was wrong, bitch I was only mistaken
I live all alone, little house, telephone, talk to you later
I'm never home, one time I thought I was home it was only the matrix

Rest in peace
I rest in peace and harmony
I don't talk, I speak
After I pray, I preach
I don't play I cheat, after I stay, I leave
Then f*ck in the robe, get the fork and eat
Turn some piggy bank into some hog head cheese
But you doing nothing 
Well they say nothin' ain't never worth nothin' but it's always free

My hand psychic's hand
She see righteous plans, I see power plans
She take my hands put 'em in her pants
Do the happy dance then I wipe my hands
Feeling like Our Father
Should I get off my high horse?
To get on my flying horses
That's rich nigga problems, avoid it
That's rich nigga problems, avoid it
Rich nigga problems, avoid it

Rich nigga, rich nigga
