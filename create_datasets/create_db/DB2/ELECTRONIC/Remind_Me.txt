Keeps reminding me
Keeps reminding me
Keeps reminding me
That it's too soon to forget you
Keeps reminding me
Keeps reminding me
Keeps reminding me
That it's too soon to forget you

I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment
'Cause I'm just out of reach of your fingers
I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment
'Cause I'm just out of reach of your fingertips

(Keeps reminding)
Keeps reminding me

Keeps reminding me
Keeps reminding me
Keeps reminding me
That it's too soon to forget you

I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment

I know
It's too soon to forget you
