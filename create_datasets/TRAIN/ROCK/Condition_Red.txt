Something evil
something malicious
is burning up the ancient's world
may our brothers stay alive
and may freedom survive

We're riding on our wings
to the sky
galactical war
just one heartbeat away
screaming out the battlecry

There is a force, a power within
within the immortal soul
bright as the sun
stronger than all
the power is in control
until the end we will defend
our brothers and their very land
moving straight ahead
Condition Red

Calls of distress
brothers, count on us
we're standing back to back
do not surrender, do not give in
we're ready to attack

We're riding on our wings 
to the sky
we're coming for your rescue
Atlantis must live
it shall never die

There is a force
...
Condition Red

We're riding on our wings
...

There is a force
...
Condition Red
