Music has charms they say
But in some people's hands
It becomes a savage beast
Can't they control it
Why don't they hold it back

You see my friend and me
Don't have an easy day
And at night we dance not fight
And we need the energy
If not the sympathy

But i'm brutalized by bass
And terrorized by treble
I'm open to change my mood but
I always get caught in the middle

And i get tired of dj's
Why's it always what he plays
I'm gonna push right through
I'm gonna tell him too
Tell him to
Play us
Play us a slow song

It's late - i'm winding down
Am i the only one
To want a strong and silent sound
To pick me up and undress me
Lay me down and caress me

I feel you touch my hand
And whisper in my ear
Ask me how i'm feeling now
And i want to get near you
But i can't even hear you

But this is a fine romance
If we have to be so demanding
We need just one more dance to
Leave here with an understanding

And i get tired of dj's
Why's it always what he plays
I'm gonna push right through
I'm gonna tell him too
Tell him to
Play us
Play us a slow song
