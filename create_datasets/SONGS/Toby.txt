Oh, oh, oh, I remember when we were kids
We shared all the hurt and tears
No matter what the weather (What the weather, what the weather)
We were always together

Then we grew up and time went on
We became separated
When I went off to school
My sweet Toby waited

I went off to school
My sweet Toby waited
Was a sad day
When Toby went away

Was a sad day
When Toby went away
Sad day
Toby went away

Sad day
Toby went away
I came home from Spring vacation
Expected to find my Toby waiting

Called her on her private phone
She didn't answer, something was wrong
I ran all the way to her house
Rang her bell

Her mother answered and told me
To come and sit a spell
I sat down to try to be prepared
For what she?d say

And what she said brought tears to my eyes
I couldn't push away
Toby left on a cloudy
Rainy day

She went to sing with angels
Toby's gone away
It was a sad day
Oh... ho... Toby went away

It was a sad day
When Toby went away
It was a sad day
Oh...oh...when Toby went away

It was a sad day
When Toby went away
Was a sad day
When Toby went away

Was a sad day
When Toby went away
