In your appointment book
you'll see you and I have a date
Let me refresh your memory;
darling you can't be late.
Don't forget, dinner at eight,

Two gardenias at your plate !
Under the table our hands will meet!

We should be able to be discreet
Lights are dim, moonlight above,
That's how people fall in love!

Just tell your mother you might be late
Don't forget, dinner at eight.
