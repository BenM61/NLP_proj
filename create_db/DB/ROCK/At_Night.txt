Sunk deep in the night 
I sink in the night 
Standing alone underneath the sky 
I feel the chill of ice 
On my face 
I watch the hours go by 
The hours go by 
You sleep 
Sleep in a safe bed 
Curled and protected 
Protected from sight 
Under a safe roof 
Deep in your house 
Unaware of the changes at night 

At night 
I hear the darkness breathe 
I sense the quiet despair 
Listen to the silence 
At night 
Someone has to be there 
Someone has to be there 

Someone must be there
