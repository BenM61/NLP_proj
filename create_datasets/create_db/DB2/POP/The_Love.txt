This is the love, something you can feel but you can't define
Can't get enough, and I don't wanna leave what we can't rewind
This is the love, something you can feel but you can't define
Can't get enough, and I don't wanna leave what we can't rewind

Yeah, ah-ye-aye-e-yeah, yeah, ah-ye-aye-e-yeah
Yeah, ah-ye-aye-e-yeah, baby, baby
Yeah, ah-ye-aye-e-yeah, yeah, ah-ye-aye-e-yeah
Yeah, ah-ye-aye-e-yeah, baby, baby

I'm so close to take me far away
I don't know, we better feel this again
All eyes closed, and make my heart awake
I just know that you're one hell of a love

Oh-woah-oh, oh-woah-oh, shadows on the ceilin'
Oh-woah-oh, oh-woah-oh, can't ignore it

This is the love, something you can feel but you can't define
Can't get enough, and I don't wanna leave what we can't rewind
This is the love, something you can feel but you can't define
Can't get enough, and I don't wanna leave what we can't rewind

Yeah, ah-ye-aye-e-yeah, yeah, ah-ye-aye-e-yeah
Yeah, ah-ye-aye-e-yeah, baby, baby
Yeah, ah-ye-aye-e-yeah, yeah, ah-ye-aye-e-yeah
Yeah, ah-ye-aye-e-yeah, baby, baby

I don't want to waste another day
Off my toes, don't think I never wanna land
I feel you in every single way
I just know that you're one hell of a love

Oh-woah-oh, oh-woah-oh, shadows on the ceilin'
Oh-woah-oh, oh-woah-oh, can't ignore it

Oh when you're holding me
I feel something, and it feels so good
Oh when you're holding me
You give me something no one ever could
Oh when you're holding me
You give me something that it feels so good
Oh when you're holding me
You give me something no one ever could

This is the love, something you can feel but you can't define
Can't get enough, and I don't wanna leave what we can't rewind
This is the love, something you can feel but you can't define
Can't get enough, and I don't wanna leave what we can't rewind
