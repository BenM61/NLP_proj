I've come to rely on you -- nobody else will do;
I'm helpless when we're apart.
You've got it through your head I love you,
Now get it through your heart.
I've come to depend on you,
Wait 'til the end with you.
Our love was right from the start.
You've got it through your head I love you,
Now get it through your heart.
No more doubt. Permanence. Inevitably you.
You can bet I depend on you to come through.
There's so much to do.
