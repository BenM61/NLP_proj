One day I know
We'll find a place of hope
Just hold on to me
Just hold on to me

Walk tight, one line
You're wanted this time
There's no one to blame
Just hold on to me

(Come on) And I'm right on time
(My love) And the birds keep singing
And you're right on line
And the bells keep ringing
(Come on) And the battle is won
(My love) And the planes keep winging
And I'm right on time
One day they'll be a place for us (And the girl keeps singing)

I walk and I wade
Through full lands and lonely
I stumble, I stumble
With you I wait
To be born again
With love comes the day
Just hold on to me

(Come on) And I'm right on time
(My love) And the birds keep singing
And you're right on line
One day they'll be a place for us (And the bells keep ringing)
(Come on) And the battle is won
(My love) And the planes keep winging
And I'm right on time
One day they'll be a place for us (And the girl keeps singing)

Now is the time
To follow through
To read the signs
Now the message sent
Let's bring it to it's final end

(Come on) And I'm right on time
(My love) And the birds keep singing
And you're right on line
One day they'll be a place for us (And the bells keep ringing)
(Come on) And the battle is won
(My love) And the planes keep winging
And I'm right on time
One day they'll be a place for us (And the girl keeps singing)

(Come on) And I'm right on time
(My love) And the birds keep singing
And you're right on line
One day they'll be a place for us (And the bells keep ringing)
(Come on) And the battle is won
(My love) And the planes keep winging
And I'm right on time
One day they'll be a place for us (And the girl keeps singing)

(Come on) One 
(My love) day
I (One day they'll be a place for us)
Know
(Come on) They'll be
(My love) A place
Called (One day they'll be a place for us)
