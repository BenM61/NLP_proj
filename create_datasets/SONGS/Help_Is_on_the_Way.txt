So you want to love me
But you don't know why
You've got a problem up ahead
That's in sight
Love to meet your uncle
Only as I was saying
I have a relative myself the same type

Call yourself a man
I said, why not if it's true
I said, you call yourself a taxi and fly
And like a bird she flew out of the window
Leaving me a box of milk tray
A note upon it to say
If nothing's alright it's okay
'Cause help is on the way

Sorry to disturb you
At this awful hour
But I was wondering
If you have the time

Supposed to meet a woman here
At half past eight
And now you're telling me
It's already nine
Man you should have seen it
As the boat overturned
There was a cry out
From a hand or a leg
And like a stone she went
Down to the bottom
Leaving us above in dismay
Despite the captain who'd say
If nothing's alright it's okay
'Cause help is on the way

I got a letter
It came as a note
It said, I'm sorry
I haven't spoke
It was written out in Braille
So I knew that it felt good
Right from the start, solo part 

I tried to reach you
But you weren't at home
I left a message
Right after the tone It said, sorry I'm not in
If you'd care to call again
I'll get back to you, back to you
So you want to love me
But you don't know why
You've got a bee up in your bonnet

That's fine
Nothing like a buzz going around
Your head
To clear the cobwebs from the state
Of your mind
Well, you won't believe this
But believe me

It's true
I had this woman
In the palm of my hand
When like a madman
She leap out the window Leaving me a box of milk tray
A note upon it to say,
If nothing's alright it's okay
'Cause help is on the way.
