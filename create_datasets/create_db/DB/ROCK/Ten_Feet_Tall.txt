Happy I'm floating 
Around on my feet now 
You make me go dizzy 
I'm weak at the knees, yes 
I feel like I'm walking 
Round ten feet tall 
I feel like I'm walking 
Round ten feet tall 

Well you say I'm faking 
And I say don't worry 
The way that I bubble 
There's something in the make, yes
I feel like I'm walking 
Round ten feet tall 
I feel like I'm walking 
Round ten feet tall 

Right, the chemistry is right 
This boy has reached his height 
This feeling just goes on and on, and on and on 
From strength to strength 
I'm ten feet long 

I feel like I'm walking 
Round ten feet tall
I feel like I'm walking 
Round ten feet tall 

I feel like I'm walking 
Round ten feet tall
I feel like I'm walking 
Round ten feet tall 

Right, the chemistry is right 
This boy has reached his height 
This feeling just goes on and on, and on and on 
From strength to strength 
I'm ten feet long 

Happy I'm floating 
Around on my feet now 
You make me go dizzy 
I'm weak at the knees, yes 
I feel
I feel
I feel
I feel

I feel 
Ten feet tall
I feel 
Ten feet tall
I feel 
Ten feet tall
I feel 
Ten feet tall
I feel like I'm walking 
Round ten feet tall 
I feel like I'm walking 
Round ten feet tall 
I feel like I'm walking 
Round ten feet tall 
I feel like I'm walking 
Round ten feet tall 
I feel like I'm walking 
Round ten feet tall 
I feel like I'm walking 
Round ten feet tall 
I feel like I'm walking 
Round ten feet tall
I feel like I'm walking 
Round ten feet tall 
I feel like I'm walking 
Round ten feet tall
