I'm thinking about when I was a sailor
Spent my time on the open seas
When we'd stay off the coast of Santa Barbara

I'd secretly steal ashore
The natives were waiting for
The boy with the lazy soul
To sing with the sailor

Vahevala, homeless sailor
Vahevala, homeward sail away
Vahevala, homeless sailor
Vahevala, homeward sail away
Every evening I'd be gone
Back on board by break of dawn

I'm thinking about the nights in Jamaica
Pretty girls dancin' here and there
Stole a keg and now I'm drunk as a sailor

The captain he don't know
Where Billy he done go
Singing with native girls
The songs of a sailor

Vahevala, homeless sailor
Vahevala, homeward sail away
Vahevala, homeless sailor
Vahevala, homeward sail away
Every single, single way
Gotta be back on board by break of day

Every night in Jamaica
I'd sing with the lady
And drink with the men till the morning appear

Healthy sunshine
Is fresh on my face
As the songs of the night puts
The ring in my ear

Vahevala, homeless sailor
Vahevala, homeward sail away
Vahevala, homeless sailor
Vahevala, homeward sail away
Every single, single way
Gotta be back on board by break of

Vahevala, homeless sailor
Vahevala, homeward sail away
Vahevala, homeless sailor
Vahevala, homeward sail away
