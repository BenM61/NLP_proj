These days 
Some days I couldn't get up couldn't get down I'm bored of everything
Somehow a little black cloud would rain over me would rain over me
Someone was making me mad good turned bad and I'd lose everything

To get you back just to get you back but...
These days, the world's all right, the sun shines bright, i'm kicking out the bad dreams
These days, I don't think twice, I walk on ice, and I'm positively somewhere
These days go on, long after you've gone

These days go on, long after you've gone
These days go on and on... 
I'm out of the fire and into the swimming pool sometimes
I'd drown my tears but the same old fears come back

Someone's been making me ill I bet you're still
A 2, 3, 4 letter word yes, you heard the pretty little bird's fly home, cause 
These days, the sun kicks in, the good guys win I'm illegal in the back seat
These days I'm safe and sound not dragged down you want to know the reason?

These days, the world's all right, the sun shines bright, I'm kicking out the bad dreams
These days, I don't think twice, I walk on ice, I'm positively somewhere
These days go on, long after you've gone
These days go on, long after you've gone

These days go on and on... 
Thank-you for not being here I feel better when you're not
Sleeping in my head tossing and turning an' messing up the sheets
The love we made was incomplete like the shoes on your feet

Same stuff I've heard it before that philosophy starting to bore me
Now you won't have to, smile and ignore me 
These days the karmas right the sun shines bright I'm kicking out the bad dreams
These days I don't think twice I walk on light I'm positively somewhere. 

These days go on, long after you've gone
These days go on, long after you've gone
These days go on and on...
