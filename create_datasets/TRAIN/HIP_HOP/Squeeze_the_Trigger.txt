Squeeze the trigger
  
Rampage on stage,my crews in a rage
Searched my posse,found the Uzi but missed the 12 gauge
Maniac,I'm a rhyme brainiac,livin' on the edge of a razor
Remember that
Cold rollin' thick as a shake,I'm rockin' hard as a quake
I can't live on bread and water or lobster and steak
My mino's a riot gun,there ain't none bigger
About to unload the ammo,"E" squeeze the trigger

They say I'm violent,they should watch their T.V.
They say I'm brutal,they should check their P.D.
You made me,now your kids rave me
I rap about the life that the city streets gave me
Murder,intrigue,somebody must bleed
Miami Vice is small time,L.A's the big league
From the rollin' 60's  to the nickerson "G"
Pueblos,grape street,this is what I see
The jungle,the 30's,the V.N.G.
Life in L.A. ain't no cup of ter
  
Squeeze the trigger
  
I've been dogged out by cops,shackled and socked
Paid my dues to the streets,took my hard knocks
Disrespected by snobs,damn near trampled by mobs
Persecuted by  squares workin' nine to five jobs
Like a panther I prowl ,like a lion I growl
Learn to see behind my back like the head of an owl
I'm the voice of the youth,the prophet of truth
What I speak is really  though some 
May say ruthless tactics are takin' by me to awaken
People  to life but I feel no fakin'
No jivin',no lyin',no frontin',no playin'
Say exactly what's up,understand what I'm sayin'
Ban me,try it,you might cause a riot
What the radio won't play,the underground will supply it
I'm a MC pirate that's loud not quiet
Radical as they make'em,make a rule I'll defy it
Critics may say I'm wise,some may call my words lies
I've lived more in one day than they will in their lives
But most do respect the words I inject
Kick credit for realism and the truth I project
Because I could bust rhymes for fun,or cut MC's like a knife
But the topic I love is the drama of life
So don't diss me don't dare,I feel you should care
You may think I'm soft but you're just unaware
Of the wrath of the Ice enraged  prepare
For a true nighmare
  
Squeeze the trigger
  
Cops hate kids,kids hate cops,cops kill kid's with warnin' shouts
What is crime and what in not?what is justice?I think I forgot
We buy weapons to keep us strong
Reagan sends guns where they don't belong
The controversy is thick and the drag is strong
But no matter  the lies we all know who's wrong
Homeless sleep on the city streets
Waitin' to die with nothin' to eat
While rich politicians soak their feet
In the pools at their ten million buck retreats
People hate people for color of face
No one had a choice in the race we were placed
A brother in queens was beaten and chased
Murdered cold in the streets, a goodamn disgrace
Just because of his race,his life went to waste
And no one went to jail when the court heard the case
Justice or corruption?it's all interlaced
How can you swallow this?I can't stand the taste

Squeeze the trigger
  
I get paid for illin',cold makin' a killin'
My pockets keep fillin',I got dollars to the ceilin'
Got a safe in my floor,car got bullet proof doors
Every time I rock the mic I leave you wishin' for more
Because my raps ain't bull,got cold stupid pull
You want to eat my rhymes like candy,till your mind's over full
But most MC's today ain't got nothin' to say
"A" to the mother fuckin' "K"
  
Squeeze the trigger
