I'm the man who came to dinner
Said I wasn't stopping long
I brought a present wrapped in misery
And a bottle of sad songs
You still said
Come on in
Make yourself at home
Would you like a drink
Let me take your coat

I stand well back in the corner
With a sneer on my face
I've got the weight of the world on my shoulders
Ready to fall on this place

And I felt like one of the family
And I could be whoever I want to be

I took you down to the sea
And let you swim in deep blue water
Sunk your suspicions but then
You couldn't get back to the shore

Come on in
Make yourself at home
Would you like a drink
Let me take your coat
