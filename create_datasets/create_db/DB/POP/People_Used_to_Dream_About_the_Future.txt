Drinking our coffee
It's a quarter to three
No one in this place
Just us and our mistakes
You in the corner
That stupid smile
On your face
Tell me is there a way to replace
All the dreams
That didn't come true
Once we were happy

Once we were people
Who used to dream about the future
Once we were people
With stars in our eyes

Do you remember when I was your
Alice blue gown'
And you were the handsome young
Prince in his crown
Now the rain hits the roof
And your realize
That even your youth has let you down
Oh don't go cry in your beer
Cause it all ends in tears
Remember when we were happy

Once we were people
Who used to dream about the future
Yeah, once we were people
With stars in our eyes

Once we were people
Who used to dream about the future

But where did it all go
Where did it all go
Where did it all go

When did we stop taking pictures
And when did you lose all your fight
And where did you sign
Give up and resign
I never gave up on you
No, I never gave up on you 

Once we were people
Who used to dream about the future
Once we were people
With stars in our eyes

Once we were people
Once we were people
