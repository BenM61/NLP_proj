Three weeks down, but you're on the mend
You swear that you're free from my passenger seat
As we drive through the night, 'til it starts again
You blame it on me 'cause you're three pills deep

I tell myself I love the silence
But maybe I just wanna hear the sound of the sirens
I tell myself I love the silence
But maybe I just wanna hear the sound of the sirens
Here comes the sound of the sirens
Here comes the sound of the sirens
Here comes the sound of the sirens

Get down
Get down

Here comes the sound of the sirens
Here comes the sound of the sirens
Here comes the sound of the sirens
Here comes the sound of the sirens
Here comes the sound of the sirens
Here comes the sound of the sirens
Here comes the sound of the sirens

Get down
Get down
