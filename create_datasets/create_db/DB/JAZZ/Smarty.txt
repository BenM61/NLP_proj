I can teach you a thing or two

Smarty, don't you know you should hold me tight
Can't you tell when you're making it right
Smarty, yes!

Oo, you think you know ev'ry star up above
Hmmm, that's all you know about
Still, you're in need of a few lessons
Baby, in love, I ain't tellin' ya nothin' wrong

Smarty, can't you see if you had a heart
Ha, ha, you could learn to be twice as smart
Smarty, come here!

(Speaking: I told ya I'd tickle ya. Ha, ha, ha! Yeah, you know it all'
Smarty. Ha, ha. Yes, I mean it. Yes, I do.)

You could learn to be twice as smart
