Senza fine
Let it always be senza fine
There's no end to our love
Our hopes, our dreams, our sighs
No end at all, no sad goodbyes
No fears, no tears, no love that dies
It's senza fine
Senza fine
Let it always be senza fine
Never-ending

The sunlit days, the moonlit nights
The sea, the sand, the starry heights
Are yours and mine forever more
All we are and all we know
Is love and love alone, so
We'll go floating far above
In never-ending timeless love

(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Let it always be senza fine)
Never-ending
The sunlit days, the moonlit nights
The sea, the sand, the starry heights
Are yours and mine forever more
Let it always be senza fine
Never-ending it's senza fine
