This time, your story had better be good
Or I may leave you, like I know I should
You say you've missed me
While I've been away
Where d'you go, and who with?
That's what I'd like to know

You have the nerve to run out like you do
You don't deserve all the love I give you

Fool am I
What a poor little fool am I
Oh why can't I strong enough, long enough
To say that we're through
Fool am I
Just a poor little fool am I
But I can't get it understood, you're no good
What can I do, I can't stop loving you

Tell me you love me
Take me and show me
Make me forgive you again

Fool am I
Just a poor little fool am I
But I can't get it understood, you're no good
What can I do, I can't stop loving you

Oh, tell me you love me
Take me and show me
Make me forgive you again

Fool am I
What a poor little fool am I
Oh why can't I strong enough, long enough
To say that we're through
Fool am I
Just a poor little fool am I
But I can't get it understood, you're no good
What can I do, I can't stop loving you
