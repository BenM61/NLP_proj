Yeah, yeah

Man said he's better than me, that's funny
They're not serious, them man are funny
They said grime was dead, I couldn't stop laughing
Man, I found that shit so funny
You don't rate Boy Better Know? That's funny
Man can't come around me and move funny
Start shutting down some of your favourite MCs
And see if you still find that shit funny

Oh shit, look who the f*ck is back
It's Mr. Love Make Duppy On Track
Man can't come and act up in my zone
Make a man drive home with your pride in your lap
2000 and BBK, it's a wrap
Round of applause flow, man'll just clap
If I can't ball out with my dargs, it's dead
I wanna say that I had fun when I look back
Hold on, wait, let me kill 'em with a likkle flow quickly
Lyrically, dem man ain't fucking with me
Man said he don't rate my team out here
That's funny, I can smell hate in the air
Man'll climb up to the top of the stair
We make the gyal dem stop and stare
They be like "'llow me fam, it's not fair"
And it's mad cause I heard man say

That he's better than me, that's funny
They're not serious, them man are funny
They said grime was dead, I couldn't stop laughing
Man, I found that shit so funny

Right now, manaman's calling it on
My life, I put it all in a song
The gyal dem know I don't play in the bed
I be mashing up gyal like Rico Strong
Forget the hype, if it's on then it's on
45 will leave your headtop gone
Dem man over there say they don't like Frisco
Thought that I cared? Trust me, you're wrong
I'm a fully grown man, I ain't no teen
This ain't an act, this ain't no scene
If a man wanna try keep up with fuckery
Leave your face all over your windscreen
Hand on my heart, no word of a lie
I am the best and I ain't gotta try
Told man already long time in my ad-lib
Diss me and get S-K-double-Y

You think this is funny?
(Hahahahaha) well, Mr. Funny Pants
Is this how you get your sick kicks?
In a cosmic sort of way, yes
