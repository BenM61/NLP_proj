I got a gun in my hand and 
I feel like a man 
I'm the pope of my generation 
I got to push myself 
Over your goddamn walls 
I don't listen to your condemnation 

Can't you see the 
Is the only cause of everything 
That you wish to stop 
And bring to an end 
But it only makes me hate you more 

Careful what you wish for 
It can only bring you down 
keep your spirit on the ground 
Emptiness the only sound 

I know what it takes to break you down 
And I'll kill everything that made you 
(I know what it takes to break you down) 

Take everything you tried to teach me 
It don't add up to a pile of shit 
All the methods you use 
As you tried to reach me 
They don't matter a single bit 

I'm alright inside 
I'm just trying to hide 
From all the propaganda 
You want to choke me with 

keep your face away 
keep your hands away 
Don't want your fingers 
In and out of my life 

I know what it takes to break you down 
(I know what it takes to break you down) 
And I'll kill everything that made you 
(I know what it takes to break you down) 
I know what it takes to break you down 
And I'll kill everything that made you
