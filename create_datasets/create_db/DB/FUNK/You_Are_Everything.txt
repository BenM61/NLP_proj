Today I saw somebody
Who looked just like you
She walked like you do
I thought it was you

As she turned the corner
I called out your name
I felt so ashamed
When it wasn't you, wasn't you, oh, oh

You are everything and everything is you
Oh, oh you are everything and everything is you
Oh, oh, you are everything and everything is you

How can I forget
When each face that I see
Brings back memories
Of being with you

I just can't go on living life as I do
Comparing each girl to you
Knowing they just won't do
They're not you

You are everything and everything is you
Oh, oh you are everything and everything is you
Oh, oh you are everything and everything is you

You are everything and everything is you
Oh, oh you are everything and everything is you
Oh, oh you are everything and everything is you
Oh, oh you are everything and everything is you
