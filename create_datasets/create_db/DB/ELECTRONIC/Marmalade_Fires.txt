We throw our loupes, our little phone
Our lovely shorts, oh marmalade fires

We throw our folds, our pots and pans
Our dirty planks, oh marmalade fires

We throw our wardrobe, cleanse out
Marmalade fires

We throw our house, our round blue skies
Our pretty hills, oh marmalade fires

We throw our wardrobe, cleanse out
Marmalade fires

We throw our bowls, our friendly tools
Assist us here, oh marmalade fires

We throw our wardrobe, cleanse out
Marmalade fires

We throw our wardrobe, cleanse out
Marmalade fires

We throw our wardrobe, cleanse out
Marmalade fires
