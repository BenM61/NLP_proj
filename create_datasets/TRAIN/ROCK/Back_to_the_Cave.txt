Oh, let's get back to the cave
No-one ever told us we had time to waste
Oh, let's get back to the cave for a little while
Ah, yeah, for a little while

Life on the outside, life on the edge
Pushin' all the buttons of love and drivin' in the wedge
Somebody's takin' from you time and time and time again
Can't believe it's not the way you want it to be

Oh, let's get back to the cave
No-one ever told us we had time to waste
Oh, let's get back to the cave for a little while
Ah, yeah, for a little while

Somebody's lookin' for you, somewhere you've seen a face
Somehow it leaves you feelin' lost and out of place
Too many wasted nights and way too many darker days
There's nothin' left to make you burn
 And nothin' left to make you wanna stay

I'm lookin' deep inside you, down where you were before
And when I find you I'll be wild and knockin' down your door
I'll drag you screamin' from this endless and angry scene
You can believe it's just the way you want it to be

Oh, let's get back to the cave
No-one ever told us we had time to waste
Oh, let's get back to the cave for a little while
Ah, yeah, for a little while

For a little while
