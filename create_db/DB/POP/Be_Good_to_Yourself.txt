Just say goodbye
Touch me deep inside
Baby, I hope it's not a farewell
You can count on me
When it's a friend you need
All the same
I hope it all goes well

Now be good to yourself
Everyday and every night
Pick yourself a girl 
Who can begin, to treat you right

Tell the truth to one another
Till your dying day
May the sun, shine down your way

You know the times we had
Been far from bad
And I hope we come together
Once again
But until that time
We just say goodbye
I'll remember you till the very end

Be good to yourself
Everyday and every night
Pick yourself a girl 
Who can begin, to treat you right

Tell the truth to one another
Till your dying day
May the sun, shine down your way

Now be good to yourself
Everyday and every night
Pick yourself a girl 
Who can begin, to treat you right

Tell the truth to one another
Till your dying day
May the sun, shine down your way

Be good to yourself
Everyday and every night
Pick yourself a girl 
Who can begin, to treat you right

Love one another
Till your dying day
May the sun, shine down your way

Let it shine
Oohâ?¦
