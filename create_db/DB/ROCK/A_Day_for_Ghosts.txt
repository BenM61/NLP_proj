The livelong day there's a voice in my cry
Growing like fire, (it brings) scorn to my smile
Time lengthens the night, and shortens the day
The ghosts I host don't seem to go away

I've got my reasons
To burn the world
Reasons all my own
A stitch by which I'm attacked
To this world of bone 

I've got my reasons
To burn the world
Reasons all my own
A stitch by which I'm attacked
To this world of bone 

A day for ghosts 
A day for ghosts 
A day for ghosts 
A day for ghosts 

Laws dissolve to reveal wonder
As they open up to pull me under
And I will put my terms to the test
To put the ghost to rest

I've got my reasons
To burn the world
Reasons all my own
A stitch by which I'm attacked
To this world of bone 

I've got my reasons
To burn the world
Reasons all my own
A stitch by which I'm attacked
To this world of bone
