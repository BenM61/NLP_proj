I wanna go there, I wanna climb
Now I don't know about no law, I don't see no crime
Ain't no reason, ain't no rest
I wanna get down to the woman and get undressed

And I can't stand it, I can't stand it
I can't wait to see them walls falling down

So tell me Jesus, why they run
Is it by the weight of the woman, the weight of the gun?
Got fifty minutes now and I just don't care
I'm gonna take this off already when I get there

And I can't stand it, I can't stand it
I can't wait to see them walls falling down
And I can't stand it, I can't stand it
I can't wait to see them walls falling down

No where tomorrow, a Sunday rhyme
You know all good things come in their due time
Put 'The Ball Peen Hammer', 'Right through' That Door'
And I don't pretend to understand no more

I can't stand it and I can't stand it
I can't wait to see them walls falling down
I can't stand it, I can't stand it
I can't wait to see them walls falling down
