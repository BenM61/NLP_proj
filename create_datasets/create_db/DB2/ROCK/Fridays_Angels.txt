Your heroes stare with glossy smiles
(Friday's Angels)
They always had that special style
(Friday's Angels)

Standing naked dressings at trial
(Friday's Angels)
You'd give anything to be there for a while
(Friday's Angels)

You're made up, played up and feeling great
Made up, played up and feeling great
Made up, played up and feeling great
But the mirror knows you're a proper state

You paint a face that's toppled kings
(Friday's Angels)
Dressed in the drag of a killer thing
(Friday's Angels)

Loaded, tough to prove you're alive
(Friday's Angels)
It's a hard, hard world but you'll survive
(Friday's Angels)

You're made up, played up and feeling great
Made up, played up and feeling great
Made up, played up and feeling great
But the mirror knows
Yeah, the mirror knows you're a proper state

Mum and dad think you're a maniac
To walk the streets dressed up like that
When you go out you won't be back
You'll risk the vampires on a Friday night

And you don't care, you know you're right
And you don't care, you know you're right
And you don't care, you know you're right
And you don't care, you know you're right
