There's a bookstore in town where no one reads
And those who remember will disappear
I hate to see them getting old
But they're better dead than read

I've just discovered something new
America called and put cables on us
Now it's crazy like Disneyland
The return of the soft machine
The return of the soft machine

Take a look what's going on
The entertainment has begun
Driving in a golden car
Bigger than America

Everybody can be a fool
You can't see it but you know it's coming
The cars are flying and the people dying
Now we're back on the wild side again

Africa screams hot, hard and mean
In Europe the crimes are in the streets
So don't cry, baby killer, daddy's gone a-hunting
And you know he'll be back again
The return of the soft machine
And you know he'll be back again

Tell the truth and damn the lies
Crushed by the fortune's famous eyes
Driving in a golden car
Bigger than America

Loadin' up an' havin' fun
The magic circle is the magic gun
Shooting for a golden star
Bigger than America

Loadin' up an' havin' fun
The magic circle is the magic gun
Shooting for a golden star
Bigger than America

Loadin' up an' havin' fun
The magic circle is the magic gun
Shooting for a golden star
Bigger than America

Loadin' up an' havin' fun
The magic circle is the magic gun
Shooting for a golden star
Bigger than America

Loadin' up an' havin' fun
The magic circle is the magic gun
Shooting for a golden star
Bigger than America

Loadin' up an' havin' fun
The magic circle is the magic gun
Shooting for a golden star
Bigger than America
