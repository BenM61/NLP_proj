Faced with a challenge of finding right and wrong
In a brand new world that recognizes none
It's hard for me to believe in all my travels
I'm the only one
The only one

Using food for thought and thought for food
All I have is my attitude, the hour glass
And my ever-changing mood

Faced with a challenge of doing all the novel talk
Wondering how to pay for the things my mouth has bought

Wanting to say the right things whenever I talk
I changed the way I stood and the way I walked

Lord help me find my way
So that I may go forward
And lead the way

Want to lose the negative but all I lose is time
There's a constant battle going on
A chained heart and mind who's winning

Faced with a challenge of knowing right from wrong
Having no preference or allegiance to either one
