I'm the textbook definition of a rebel
I see the crowd moving left and I've got go right
I'm always in some trouble
To me life ain't fun unless you're in a good fight

So the more you're good to me
The more I try to get you to leave

All my life I've made excuses
Pushing you away, saying that you're not for me
All my life I ran from Cupid
I tried everything
In the end it was you
In the end, in the end it was you

All I wanna do is have a good time
Let the beat go through me and just take me away
You've been trying to get with me for a while
And I've been telling you to save that for another day

So the more you're good to me
The more I try to get you to leave

All my life I've made excuses
Pushing you away, saying that you're not for me
All my life I ran from Cupid
I tried everything
In the end it was you
In the end, in the end it was you

No no no
I never would've thought
You'd be the one
That I'd be with in the end

I never would've dreamed
That you and me
Were be together in the end
Were be together in the end

All my life I've made excuses
Pushing you away, saying that you're not for me
All my life I ran from Cupid
I tried everything
In the end it was you
In the end, in the end it was you
