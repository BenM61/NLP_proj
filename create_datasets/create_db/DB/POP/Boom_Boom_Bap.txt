The boom boom bap, the tap a tap tap
Well, that's the beat of my life
A weak heart drop, oh, poppa don't stop
Bittersweet about life

You know that barroom belles, well, they're calling
You know their perfume smells like blood
If looks could kill singing dollar, dollar bill
Well, that's the beat of my life

A Zigaboo kick, a Jimmy Chank lick
Well, that's the beat of my heart
A come again cut, I'll be telling you what
That's the betterest part

You know the barroom boys, well, they've fallen
And juice joint Jane got high
If looks could kill singing dollar, dollar bill
On the street of my heart

To the beat, to the beat, to the beat
Play it over and over again
Play it over and over again, let me know, let me know, let me know
I am yours and I'm ready to go

The yes, yes y'all was the siren call
To come around to my life
I said big beat drum, hear it kitty come, come
That's the sound of my life

The Brewski Point was calling
That got bellywash blood in my heart
The boom boom rap, the tap a tap tap
And that's only the start

I'll wait till December, baby
I'll wait till my hands stay still
And then in December, baby
I'm in for the cure or kill

Hard times sucker MC's
Jays Game, thirty days
Wake up Hollis Crew
Rock Box it's like that

I love you still, I always will
