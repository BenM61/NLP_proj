Woke up in the middle of the night cold sweating
Ass stinging no breath legs clinging to the bedside

Hard pressed just to get a little rest every night
Same shit can't remember last time that I slept right

This situation's gotten out of control
With all this stress and confrontation I just might overload
My problems follow me to sleep at night won't let me go
The more I hide the more they thrive deep down inside of my soul
Listen

Got burnt by women poor dirts? In Venice
Landlords and tenants, got served by creditors

We have a deep passion
We can't keep dwelling on problems

Close relations past friendships don't last
No benefits plan, wrote a letter to my senator

We have a deep passion
We can't keep dwelling on problems

This situation's gotten out of control (hey he hey)
With all this stress and confrontation I just might overload (hey he hey)
My problems follow me to sleep at night won't let me go (hey he hey)
The more I hide the more they thrive deep down inside of my soul (hey he hey)
Singing

These bad dreams
These bad dreams
These bad dreams
These bad dreams 

Shit now I lay me down to sleep
Please god let it end once again let me live life

We have a deep passion
We can't keep dwelling on problems

'Cause I can't do another long dance with a ghost
See my head wanna come around half past midnight

We have a deep passion
We can't keep dwelling on problems

This situation's gotten out of control (hey he hey)
With all this stress and confrontation I just might overload (hey he hey)
My problems follow me to sleep at night won't let me
