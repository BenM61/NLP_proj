I'll never let you walk 
Away without a word to say 
Tell me your heart, pull it all out 
I'll try to understand 

Cause this is not what you really need 
And this is not what you really want 
This is not the way it's supposed to go 
Tell me Baby no one will really know 

There's nowhere to run, there's nowhere to hide 
You got to trust in me 
There's nowhere to run, there's nowhere to hide 
You got to trust in me 

Don't feel ashamed to call my name 
Whenever you need a friend 
I will be there to pick you up 
When you're tumbling down 

Cause this is not what you really need 
And this is not what you really want 
This is not the way it's supposed to go 
Tell me Baby no one will really know
