Walked into town on silver spurs that jingle too
A song that I had only sung for just a few
She saw my silver spurs and said lets pass some time
And I will give to you summer wine
Oh, summer wine

(Gry)
Strawberry, cherries, and an angle kissin spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I shall give to you summer wine
Oh, summer win

Alexander Hacke
My eyes grew heavy and my lips they would not speak
I tried to get up but I could find my feet
She reassured me with an unfamiliar line
And when she gave to me more summer wine
Oh, summer wine

(Gry)
Strawberry, cherries, and an angle kissin spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I shall give to you summer wine
Oh, summer wine

Alexander Hacke
When I woke up the sun was shinning in my eyes
My silver spurs were gone, my head felt twice it size
She took my silver spurs-the dollar and the dime
And left me cravein for summer wine
Oh, summer wine

(Gry)
Strawberry, cherries, and an angle kissin spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I shall give to you summer wine
Oh, summer wine
