Did we give away too much or was it right?
I just wanna go back home and hold you tight
I can't face another crowd and feel this way
Oh no, oh no

I'm falling into every little trap that I can find
Reading too much into every single sign
I can't face you with the others all around
Oh no, oh no
I need some time to breathe
I can't fix what's wrong

Well the world I see is only two lanes wide
From this midnight van to Georgia that we ride
And the toll booths become markers of the time
Oh no, oh no

We come and go so fast
Looking for what lasts
