There's a voice in my head
That I probably should have trusted
From the start, oh, from the start

I've finally flipped out
And I'm hiring a detective
To find out where I've been
Where I've been

There's a voice in my head
That I probably should have trusted
From the start, oh, from the start

I've finally flipped out
And I'm hiring a detective
To find out where I've been
Where I've been

I'm here, I've been hoping you'd find me
I'm here, I've been waiting, waiting for you
I'm here, I've been hoping you'd find me
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm here, I've been hoping you'd find me
I'm here, I've been waiting, waiting for you
I'm here, I've been hoping you'd find me
Oh, oh, oh, oh

On the Lam, on the Lam
On the Lam, on the Lam
