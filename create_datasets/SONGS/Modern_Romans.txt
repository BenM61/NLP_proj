Modern Romans, false gods
Colonial maneuvers, the writings on the wall
Maybe a solution working on a clue
Now we know for certain, now we know for sure

Modern Romans, lies on parade
Instruction to the masses, protect us they say
Looking for answers, working it through
Now we know for certain, now we know for sure

Your judgment is demanding, you push beyond the need
World domination, runaway greed
Maybe, just maybe, maybe its true
Now we know for certain, now we know for sure

Tired of your judgments, your demands
Forgiveness is beyond you, you will never understand
You love the nightlife, stepping with crowd
Do you know desperation, have you ever cried out loud

Total repetition
Total repetition
Total repetition

Modern Romans, false gods
Colonial maneuvers, pagan sword
Maybe there's an answer, looking for a clue
Now we know for certain, now we know for sure
