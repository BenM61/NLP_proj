Sex
Sex is perverted and sick
Come with me
Share the magic
Live the dream
Let's go down to groovy street

And catch the scene
We'll lose ourselves
Get our kicks
Embrace the beat
Forget what's real
And burn out on a love so sweet
Fever's got me walking blind

I cannot see
I've lost my mind
I like to watch the way you walk
I live to hear the words you talk
I'd love to know the things you do
When no one's there to spy on you
I want to crawl inside your head
To kiss your mind and lips of red
I dig the things you do to me
You've lit the fire to set me free

Oh baby
Underneath hot white light
Give a scream
Take us up into the sky
And sets us free
We'll lose ourselves
Get our kicks
Embrace the beat
Forget what's real

And burn out on a love so sweet
Take all you need and leave the rest
Now follow me to take the best
