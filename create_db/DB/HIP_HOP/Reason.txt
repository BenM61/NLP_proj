Reason look at her 
(Reason look at her) 
And tell 'er what to do 
(What to do) 
So she can come back to life (so she can come back to life) 
And won't feel sad no more (and won't feel sad no more) 

She feels lost in her darkness 
She feels bad in her darkness 

(Give her the reason,
Just give her the reason to hold on 
Give her the reason 
Just give her the reason to hold on) 

Reason come back to her (reason come back to her) 
Please tell her where to go (where to go) 
So she can find a place 
Where she won't feel bad no more (she won't feel bad no more) 

She feels lost in her darkness 
She feels bad in her darkness 

(Give her the reason 
Just give her the reason to hold on 
Give her the reason 
Just give her the reason to hold on) 

In the end she should know 
That she is drowning in sorrow, all alone 
So let's hope she'll change her faith 
And make all this sadness stop 

(Ooh) she feels lost (in her darkness) 
She feels bad (in her darkness) 

Give her the reason 
Just give her the reason to hold on 
(Give her the reason 
Just give her the reason to hold on)

Let her touch us, try that again
She's trying to fly, like another one
Another one
Oh, another one
Oh, another one
