Shall we go out looking for big mushrooms on the silver plate?
Shall we go out looking for brown mushrooms more than five inches across? 
Maybe we can find them very soon.
Maybe we can find them at the Italian restaurant. 

Shall we go out looking for big mushrooms piled high on the plate?
Shall we go out looking for brown mushrooms like an open umbrella? 

Maybe we can find them under the moon.
Maybe we can find them at the Italian restaurant. 

In fifteen minutes
They'll become appetizers,
They'll be cut into pieces,
To be mushroom spaghetti.
