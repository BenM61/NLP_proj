My brother, where are you now?
Little sister, did I let you down?
My lover, must I remain your clown?
I got up here angel
I can't get me down

And I tell you what it would take
Just to get me back to believing
You'd be down on your bended knees
Begging to be my bride once more
And I tell you what it would take
Just to stop this old heart from grieving
You'd be giving me everything
Four on the floor

Sweet La Brea over angel hair
(Well you cooled on me) darling don't let's go there
Well Atlanta with your eyes so bright
I climbed up here angel but it don't feel right

And I tell you what it would take
Just to get me back to believing
You'd be down on your bended knees
Begging to be my bride once more
And I tell you what it would take
Just to stop this old heart from grieving
You'd be giving me everything
Four on the floor
