We be the untraditional, metaphorically medicinal
Tunafishypoo decibel peaks be my ritual
One condition though
I'm layin' law like the municipal
Lyrics habitual, wit' puffin' buddha
Get your crew and I'm-a do the opposite of peace
And go to war, so go prepare your boys for floor show
Eatin' every morsel
I'm your corporal, rather resourceful
Rippin' rappers from their dome-piece to their torso
No remorse for imitators
My crew be innovators
Paying homage as well as returnin' favors
Learnin' flavors from the path-pavers
But now Ozomatli be makin' new hits from past data

Super Bowl Sundae
This is Super Bowl Sundae
Super Bowl Sundae
This is Super Bowl Sundae

I'm Chali 2nafish
Ain't no twist in my posture
Lickin' shots 'cause a brotha gots to get my propers
Shrimp and lobsters on my dock like a mobster
Givin' shouts in states to sustain my stature
Altered chemically, ain't no gimmick behind
The way that I'm designin' my rhyme
Line for line, you'll find in your neighborhood
There's a flavor flood
Whether you're a ghetto star
Or if your name is mud
We speak the truth rather courageously 
And I act rather contagiously
When the stage is free
The rage in me is contained
Now they got me, Chali 2nafish and Ozomatli
