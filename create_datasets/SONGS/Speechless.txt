Speechless
Tragic, completely.
When the one you love keeps running games with your heart.
I feel the static inside me, 
Should I stay, should I go I don't know where to start.
Oh no

Cause babe you and I don't you know we've got Something that's beautiful 
(beautiful) 
And yes you're the one even though that I know
Its illogical 
Cause baby... 

You've got something over me right now its all a mystery, this thing taking over you see 
No matter what I do I'm speechless over you
It don't make any sense at all, but I'm here to always take the fall.
Baby here's the proof no matter what I do I'm speechless over you.

I panic should I let go? 
Cause life ain't as easy as a simple ABC.
I had it, baby you know, 
You've been steering that wheel to some where I can't see 
(I can't see)

Cause babe you and I don't you know we've got something incredible 
And yes your the one even though that I know its illogical.
Cause baby... 
You've got something over me right now its all a mystery, this thing taking over you see 
No matter what I do I'm speechless over you
It don't make any sense at all, but I'm here to always take the fall.
Baby here's the proof no matter what I do I'm speechless over you.

Why can't you give your heart away 
(give your heart away)
What can I do to make you stay 
(to make you stay)
Cause when I try to walk away 
(try to walk away)
Something tells me...
