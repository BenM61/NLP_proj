Feeling through a maze of opportunities,
Some passed away and gone.
The past left no future until the winds of change, change us all.

You call me on the telephone,
Tell me what a fool feels like.
You've been pushed before,
Now push back with all of your might.

You should seek what you haven't known,
See how it goes for a world of good.
Face the sunrise, stare the rest down.

You call me on the telephone,
Tell me what a fool feels like.
You've been pushed before,
Now push back with all of your might.

Someday I'll feel the same way that you do,
Someday you'll feel a different way too.

You call me on the telephone,
Tell me what a fool feels like.
You've been pushed before,
Now push back with all of your might.
