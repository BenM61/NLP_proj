I will bid farewell, sever the ties. is this what I am?
Is this all that's left?
Turn from deceit, the love of self is death, deliverance is given to you
I will bid farewell sever the ties
Now your heart beats back with deception, you have been forsaken
Leave behind (i will) all reminders of you
I will bid farewell to all lies, I will bid farewell sever the ties
Searching always searching, hoping for a change, I will never be satisfied, I will never be
I will never be satisfied, I will now bid farewell
I will bid farewell to all lies, I will bid farewell sever the ties
