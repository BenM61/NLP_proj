(I need air)

Electrify my body
And you're making me feel like I'm so electric
Everything you do is making me blow-blow-blow
Don't know what to do about it
Can't seem not to live without it
All I wanna do is just know-know-know
You suffocate my mind
And now my atmosphere is crowded
And you being here is making me blow-blow-blow
You penetrate my space
And now I'm looking outta place
And you're making it hard for me, I need air

I breathe air 
I breathe air 
I breathe air 
I breathe air 

Kaleidoscope of colors that you bring to me
You're freaking out my energy
I'm losing and you're making me low-low-low
Don't know what to do about it, you and I can't live without it
All I wanna do is just go-go-go
You smother my emotions
Now I'm driving in your ocean
And I'm running and I'm feeling like I don't care
Penetrate my space
And now you're looking outta place
'Cause you're making this hard for me, I need air

I breathe air
I breathe air 
And you're taking my air
I breathe air 
I breathe air 

Making my body so erotic
It's making my body so erotic

I breathe air 
I breathe air 

You penetrate my space
And now I'm looking outta place
And you're making it hard for me, I need air

I breathe air (I breathe air)
I breathe air
Yeah, 
I breathe air
Can you feel it, yeah
I breathe air
And you're taking my air

Yeah, 
Air
And you're taking my air
Yeah, 
(I need air)

And you're taking my air
