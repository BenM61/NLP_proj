My turn to love you
I got to do, got to do
My turn to love you
Got to do, got to do, got to do

My turn to love you
I got to do, got to do 
My turn to love you
Got to do, got to do, got to do

If I didn't love ya
Would I tell you 'bout the future? 
And if I didn't love ya
Would I even seem to care?

Turn out the lights, turn out the lights, turn out the lights
And we can talk about it sometime
Turn out the lights, turn out the lights, turn out the lights
This is not the place or time

My turn to love you
I got to do, got to do
My turn to love you, you
Got to do, got to do, got to do

My turn to love you
I got to do, got to do
My turn to love you
Got to do, got to do, got to do

My turn to love you
I got to do, got to do
My turn to love you
Got to do, got to do, got to do

When you said you loved me
Did I even seem to flinch?
Toothful that you gave me  
And you didn't feel the pinch?

Turn out the lights, turn out the lights, turn out the lights
Now don't you tell me 'bout your boyfriend
Turn out the lights, turn out the lights, turn out the lights
'Cause he can't love you 'til the end like I can

My turn to love you
I got to do, got to do
My turn to love you
Got to do, got to do, got to do

Turn out the lights, turn out the lights, turn out the lights
And we can talk about it sometime
Turn out the lights, turn out the lights, turn out the lights
This is not the place or time

Turn out the lights, turn out the lights, turn out the lights
