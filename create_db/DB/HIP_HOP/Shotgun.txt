What you're gonna do when you're sitting all alone
In your empty ass home with the mother fucker sawed-off
Pop off the rock ship, pop pop pop off the rock ship

My nose is running like me from the police
It's been three weeks and I ain't got no sleep
Now I'm chillin' where the players and the hoes be
With two broke ass hands trying to roll weed
All because I pop pop p-pop off the rock ship
You might maybe know a lot of things, baby, not this
And I'll do it all again for you, watch this
As I limp my ass back to the cockpit

Now start it up, let the engine roar 
All the people in the mosh pit scream for more
Yeah, they scream for more, (yeah) so light it up
'Cause the way we live our lives seems right to us
Let me tell you people what you need to know
You gotta plant a lot of seeds for your weed to grow
You've also gotta know when you need to run
You hear that, that's the sound of a shotgun

[Repeat: x4]
Everybody jumps from the sound of a shotgun
In my neighborhood, everybody got one

What you're gonna do when you're sitting all alone
In your empty ass home with the mother fucker sawed-off
Pop off the rock ship, pop pop pop off the rock ship

Woke up in the morning in the county jail
And I can't remember yesterday that well
Hell I, can't remember when I slept that well
I told this girl I been fucking to get my belt
'Cause I pop pop p-pop off the rock ship
You probably heard it all before, baby, not this
Here's the shout to you ladies with the hot tits
Courtesy of Limp Bizkit on some rock shit

Now here we go, start it up
Should I remind you mother fuckers, I don't give a f*ck
(Hell no) I never have, (hell yeah) I never will
And I will always understand how the haters feel
Let me tell you people what you need to know
You gotta plant a lot of seeds for your weed to grow
You've also gotta know when you need to run
You hear that, that's the sound of a shotgun

Everybody jumps from the sound of a shotgun
In my neighborhood, everybody got one

Everybody's got one

Pop off the rock ship
Pop pop p-pop off the rock ship

Pop off the rock ship
Pop pop p-pop off the rock ship
