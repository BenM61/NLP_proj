Oh, oh, oh,
Yeah yeah yeah
Hey

If loving you is easy,
Playing by the rules,
But you said love taste so much better when its cruel
To you everything was just a game,
Yeah you played me good,
But I want you, I want you, I want you,
So much more than I should,
Yes I do.

I've got my hands up so take your aim,
Yeah I'm ready,
There's nothing that we can't go through,
Oh it hit me like a steal freight train,
When you left me,
And nothing ever hurt like you,
Nothing ever hurt like you.

I was naive and wide eyed,
But you made me see,
That you don't get to taste the honey,
Without the sting of a bee,
No you don't.

Yes you stung me good,
Oh yeah you dug in deep,
But ill take, ill take it, ill take it
Till I'm down on my knees.

I've got my hands up so take your aim,
Yeah I'm ready,
There's nothing that we can't go through,
Walk a thousand miles on broken glass,
It wont stop me,
From making my way back to you,
Its not real till you feel the pain,
And nothing ever hurt like you,
Nothing ever hurt like you.

Oh everything was just a game,
Yeah you played me good,
But I want you, I want you, I want you,
I want you, I want you.

I've got my hands up so take your aim,
Yeah I'm ready,
There's nothing that we can't go through,
Walk a thousand miles on broken glass,
It wont stop me,
From making my way back to you,
Its not real till you feel the pain,
And nothing ever hurt like you,
Nothing ever hurt like you.
