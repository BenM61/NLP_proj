It keeps raining and raining 
Tears from my eyes 
Since you gone 
All I do is cry 
Won't somebody help me?
Somebody help me?
Can't you see 
That my baby done left me?
She left me reeling and rocking 
Walking the floor 
She left a note last night 
She won't be back no more 

It keeps raining and raining 
Tears from my eyes 
Since you gone 
All I do is cry 
Won't somebody help me?
Somebody help me?
Can't you see 
That my baby done left me 
She left me reeling and rocking 
Walking the floor 
She left a note last night 
She won't be back no more
