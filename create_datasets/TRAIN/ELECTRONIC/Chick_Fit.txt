Boy I can't stand your heat 
Got me lying awake 
I haven't eaten all week 
Got me obsessing all day 
Oh what you done to me 
Can't stop calling your name 
Check me I'm acting all weird 

(Bridge) 
All my girls say boy I'm totally gone 
Acting crazy I don't know what I'm on 
It's not easy tryin' to put on a front 
Baby I'm speechless I don't know what you've done 

Boy whenever you call my stomach's in bits 
I can't focus at all you got me twisted 
I live for that talk when you call me your chick 
Just so all the girls know I gotcha for keeps 
My coolness is blown I need my fix 
In a matter of days I'm not myself 
I'm all over the place I get a chick fit 
When I hear your name I totally flip 

Boy you're too hot for me 
Can't stop melting away 
When I see you I can't speak 
Switching when I see your face 
Acting like I'm a teen 
Waiting outside your place 
Boy this is really not me 

(Bridge)

Boy whenever you call my stomach's in bits 
I can't focus at all you got me twisted 
I live for that talk when you call me your chick 
Just so all the girls know I gotcha for keeps 
My coolness is blown I need my fix 
In a matter of days I'm not myself 
I'm all over the place I get a chick fit 
When I hear your name I totally flip 

Completely lost my mind 
Somethings taken over me 
Boy you're one of a kind 
Just how a man's supposed to be 
Acting like I'm a teen 
Calling you every day 
Boy this is really not me 

(Bridge) 

Boy whenever you call my stomach's in bits 
I can't focus at all you got me twisted 
I live for that talk when you call me your chick 
Just so all the girls know I gotcha for keeps 
My coolness is blown I need my fix 
In a matter of days I'm not myself 
I'm all over the place I get a chick fit 
When I hear your name I totally flip
