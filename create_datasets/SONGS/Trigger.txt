Have we lost the spark or a guide?
What's the latest on the screen?
Can't be too late to turn around
I need all the help from you

I need to find
Something to blame for a long lost time

I am running from something that I don't know
I am searching for something, which way to go?
I am trying to separate what's real
I'm running in a wheel

Is it dark or is it bright?
What's the latest on the screen?
Please tell me my name
I haven't checked it today

I am running from something that I don't know

From green to red our days pass by
Waiting for a sign to tell us why
Are we dancing all alone?

Collect some stars to shine for you
And start today 'cause there's only a few
A sign of times my friend

My friend, avoid infinity
Are you for real?

Just scratch the surface
And you will find
Something to blame for a long lost time
