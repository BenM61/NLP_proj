Don't give me you tired act
After you've been running around
The time you spend with me you shouldn't be
Coming down(coming down)
Don't give me you're attitude(attitude)
Saying what you will and will not do(do)
Baby we need compromise if were gonna make it through

Push you're self a lil more boy
For me you gotta try a lil harder
I'm doing this for the love of you
Show me you're always gonna be there
No matter what your always gonna be there
Here's what you gotta do

I want to see you back flip,cartwheel,
Don't be cutting corners on me
Gotta give me all that you've got
I need to see it to believe it
I want to see ya back flip for real
Show me that you really do feel
Every thing you say that you do
I need to see it to believe

Don't give me no baggage cash
I've got plenty on my own
Bring me all your good stuff
Baby leave the rest at home

You've gotta realize a fee
Want to hear all that you believe
But if it ain't about being faithful
Then it ain't impressing me

Push you're self a lil more boy
For me you gotta try a lil harder
I'm doing this for the love of you
Show me you're always gonna be there
No matter what your always gonna be there
Here's what you gotta do

I want to see you back flip,cartwheel,
Don't be cutting corners on me
Gotta give me all that you've got
I need to see it to believe it
I want to see ya back flip for real
Show me that you really do feel
Every thing you say that you do
I need to see it to believe it

I want to be with you
There nothing I wouldn't do

I want to see ya back flip for real
Show me that you really do feel
Every thing you say that you do
I need to see it to believe it

I want to see ya back flip for real
Show me that you really do feel
Every thing you say that you do
I need to see it to believe it
