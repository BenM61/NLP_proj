We're sittin' pretty, have you heard?
I gotta tell you that's a little absurd
Some things are too fast for me to fight
I'll jump the cliff and hit the other side

Oh, these hazy days, on my mind
Oh, these hazy days, on my mind

We're sittin' pretty, have you heard?
I thought I'd tell you that's a little absurd
The open lies you gotta smile
When you dine with the man holding dollar signs

Oh, these lady days, on my mind
Oh, these lady days, on my mind

We're sittin' pretty in the world
And then I notice another girl
Some things are too fast for me to fight
I'll jump the cliff and hit the other side

Oh, these dazy days, on my mind
Oh, these dazy days, on my mind
