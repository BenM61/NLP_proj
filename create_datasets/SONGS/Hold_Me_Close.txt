He takes directions from the way the wind blows
He's attracted by the way that she steps on
He keeps looking and she knows

Never used to get the 7.30
He's got a job and has to be in early, oh
But suddenly there's this girl and he thinks

Hold me close
And I?ll never ever think about letting you go
Hold me close
'Cause I never ever wanna be without you
Never ever wanna be without you, oh

Makes a letter from a piece of paper
Asking whether she would meet him later on
He'd be a fool to let this go

He folds it up, it goes back in his pocket
He wished he had it but he hasn't got it, no
He?ll never know if she thinks

Hold me close
And I?ll never ever think about letting you go
Hold me close
'Cause I never ever wanna be without you
Never ever wanna be without you

All over the world there's people
So close to meeting people
But don't have the nerve to risk a no
So they sleep alone

Oh I'll never ever have anyone to hold them close
They let it go
But I never ever wanna be without you
Never ever wanna be without you

Hold me close
And I?ll never ever think about letting you go
Hold me close
'Cause I never ever wanna be without you
Never ever wanna be without you
