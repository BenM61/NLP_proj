Trusting in our machine
We head for oblivion

Raising the first alarm 
Red light, red light 
This is a warning sound 
Red light, red light 

There's a haze coming down 
Upon us 
Every tribe for themselves 
United in chaos 

Raising the first alarm 
Red light, red light 
This is a warning sound 
Red light, red light 
Invading force alert 
Sirens wailing 
Air raiders in the sky 
Circling 

(Raising the first alarm
This is the warning sound
Raising the first alarm
This is the warning sound)

Now the power's out 
All that I can see 
Is the gleaming white 
Of your retina 
Light the path for me 
Blaze the trail again 
Lead the exodus 
Back inside the cage 

Raising the last alarm 
Red light, red light 
This is a warning sound 
Red light, red light 
Invading force alert 
Sirens wailing 
Air raiders in the sky 
Circling
