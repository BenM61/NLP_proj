My life's a tree, the leaves the songs
A useless love masquerade
It's only me carried along
Elusive ways

There's so much love to give
But stuck within a million mazes
What is the use of chasing the wind
Gathering dreams, nobody believes in

The answer is to be found
Totally life unbound
Until the sounds die down
Then after the last encore
We'll play on forever more

We've only met between the lines
Between the words on a page
All what's been said beyond the rhymes
Hides in a haze
