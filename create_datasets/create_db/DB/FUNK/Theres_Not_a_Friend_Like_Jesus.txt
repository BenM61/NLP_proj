There's not a friend like the lowly Jesus,
No, not one! No, not one!
No one can heal our soul diseases,
No, not one! No, not one!
Jesus knows all about my troubles,
He will shurely guide us 'till the day, the day is done; oh
Lord,
There's not a friend, Lord, yes, like the lowly, Lord, the
lowely Jesus,
No, not one! No, not one!
Jesus knows all about my troubles,
He will shurely guide us until my day on earth is done;
Oh, there's - there's not a friend, yes, like the lowly, Lord,
the lowely Jesus,
No, not one! No, not one!
