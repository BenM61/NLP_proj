Never knew I could feel like this
Like I've never seen the sky before
Want to vanish inside your

Every day I love you more and more
Listen to my heart
Can you hear it sing?
Telling me to give you everything

Season may change, winter to spring
But I love you until the end of time
Come what may, come what may
I will love you until my dying day

Suddenly the world seems such a perfect place
Suddenly it loses me with such a perfect face
Suddenly my life doesn't see such a waste
All revolves around you

And there is no mountain too high
No river too wide
Sing out this song
I will be there by your side

Strong clouds may gather, storms may
But I love you, I love you till the end of time
Come what may, come what may
I will love you until my dying day
