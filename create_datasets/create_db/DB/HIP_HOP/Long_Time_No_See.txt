As I slept, I had a dream of you
Havin' fun, like we used to do
You were laughing from something I said
What a feelin' going through my head
Then we embraced, as our lips entwined
Something that we did time to time
Suddenly as I picked you up
You were gone, and then I woke up

Long time no see
Long time no hear
Do I think about you
You're not here
Outta sight, outta mind
It just ain't right
'Cause I think about you
Every night

Shall we go right back to sleep
So you can enter
Back into my dreams
To have a chance
To finish what we started
Before I woke up
Baby, your love departed
See nothin' happen, 'cause you did not return
To give my body that ol' love I yearn, baby
Shall I move on
Reality in sight
'Cause it's over and we both have lives

Long time no see
Long time no hear
Do I think about you
You're not here
Outta sight, outta mind
It just ain't right
'Cause I think about you
Every night

Can't get you out of my night
Can't get you out of my night
Can't get you out of my mind
Gotta get you back in my life
Gotta get you back in my life
Gotta get you back in my life
Can't get you out of my mind
Baby

Long time no see
Long time no hear
Do I think about you
You're not here
Outta sight, outta mind
It just ain't right
'Cause I think about you
Every night
