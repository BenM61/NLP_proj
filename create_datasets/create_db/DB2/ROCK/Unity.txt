There's a war going down between my brothers tonight 
I don't want no war going down tonight 

Civilization ha I call it as I see it 
I call it bullshit you know I still cannot believe it 
Our evolution now has gone the way of hate 
A world evolved resolved in this stupid fate 

Stop this... war!

All so different yeah I say were all the same 
All caught you know in the division game 
Self destruction fast impending like a bullet 
No one can stop it once its fired no one can control it 

A final word, wait it's not a call to action 
We ain't no sect, no this ain't no fucking faction 
Unity, unity you've heard it all before
This time its not exclusive we want to stop a war 

Unity as one stand together
Unity evolutions gonna come
