Arthur lying down dreaming a dream
Woke up to realise life wasn't as it seems
Four walls a bed and a wonderful view
But he's feeling lonely without the rest of his crew

The prison's going down

Arthur wide awake feels misunderstood
What did he do to upset the neighbourhood?
Just being free as a bird
After all that's what they said they loved
When will it be explained to him when he gets above?

The prison's going down

Arthur's thinking 'bout the past
All of those crazy times loving very fast
What does the future hold will he get out soon?
Is there someone out there
Who'll phone him this afternoon?

The prison's going down
