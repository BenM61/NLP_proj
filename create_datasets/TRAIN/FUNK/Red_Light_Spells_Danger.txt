Red light spells danger,
Can't hold out much longer
'Cause red light means warning,
Can't hold out I'm burning

No, no, no,
You took my heart and turned me on
And now the danger sign is on
Never thought the day would come
When I would feel alone without you

And now I'm like a child again
Calling out his mama's name
You got me on a ball and chain
Doin' things that I don't want to

I can't stop running to you,
Feel love coming through you
Girl, with you beside me,
Hold on heaven guide me

Red light spells danger,
Can't hold out much longer
'Cause red light means warning,
Can't hold out I'm burning

Red light spells danger,
Can't hold out much longer
'Cause red light means warning,
Can't hold out I'm burning

I had my fun, I played around
Without a love to tie me down
I always used to kiss and run,
I never wanted love to catch me

I thought I had a heart of stone
But now I'm in the danger zone
I can feel the heat is on,
Soon the flames are gonna catch me

I can't stop running to you,
Feel love coming through you
Girl, with you beside me,
Hold on heaven guide me

Red light spells danger,
Can't hold out much longer
'Cause red light means warning,
Can't hold out I'm burning

Red light spells danger,
Can't hold out much longer
'Cause red light means warning,
Can't hold out I'm burning
