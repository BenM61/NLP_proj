Never before had i felt so safe
I'd open my eyes to see you laying there
So insecure i felt just like a fake
How could anybody really care?

Care for me, Care to see
I dont like you knowing where i started

There was a time
I was a lonely highway
One of the lights they passed like ghosts
You came up close and stayed
There was a time
You always had the answers
Your words spun like dancers
And with my pride, i pushed your words away

Regardless of where i was and what i said
Look where this front of mine has led me to
Now i can see just how far you have gone
I understand you would have taken me with you

And you knew, all along
You were in the right and i was wrong

There was a time
I was a lonely highway
One of the lights they passed like ghosts
You came up close and stayed
There was a time
You always had the answers
Your words spun like dancers
And with my pride, i pushed your words away

The past has such a hold on me
You were the only love, that set me free
So where do i belong now
If i could go back there and do it all again

There was a time
I was a lonely highway
One of the lights they passed like ghosts
You came up close and stayed
There was a time
You always had the answers
Your words spun like dancers
And with my pride, i pushed your words away

Pushed your words away

You always had the answers
If i could go back there and do it all again...
