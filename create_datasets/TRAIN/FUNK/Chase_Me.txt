How can you just sit and be cool
The music's growin' and it's makin' me move
Come on and get up (Well, hey, hey)
Come on and get up

How can you just stay in your seat
The music's callin', so get up on your feet
Come on get up (Oh, whoa, well)
Come on and get up

Chase me
Chase me, honey, alright
You can chase me
Chase me through the night

Come on and chase me
Chase me, honey, alright
You can chase me
Chase me through the night

Can't funk it tomorrow
So funk it tonight
If you gonna do it, yeah

I'm checkin' my meter
And there's nothing sweeter
So put on your dancin', joggin' shoes
I assure you, you just can't lose, you got to

Chase me

Groovin' with people
They're treatin' me right
Shakin' the ceiling, yeah
On a dancin' night

Look at my mama
She's been out all night
Chasin' my daddy, yeah
In the sweet moonlight, you got to

Chase me

You can chase me
Chase me through the night

Chase me through the night
