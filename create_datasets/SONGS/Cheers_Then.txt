Cheers then here's two old friends 
We thought we'd never say goodbye 
But those good times came to an end 
And its not worth another try 
Familiar place familiar face 
But feeling's not the same 
Try to relive what we once did 
Its just a silly game 

Cheers then here's two old friends 
We thought we'd never say goodbye 
But those good times came to an end 
And its not worth another try 
One of the crowd 
It felt so safe 
I never felt alone 
Together everyday and night 
When you and me were young 

Ooh ooh ooh... 
Cheers then here's two old friends 
We thought we'd never say goodbye 
But those good times came to an end 
And its not worth another try 
Time that lapsed a bond collapsed 
We never planned for that 
You felt betrayed I let you down 
You're better on your own 

Ooh ooh ooh... 
Cheers then, it had to end 
Cheers then, another try 
Cheers then, here's two old friends 
Cheers then, we're saying goodbye 
Cheers then, we're saying goodbye 
Cheers then...
