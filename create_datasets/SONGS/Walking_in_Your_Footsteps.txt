It's where I'm coming from
It's where you're going
In a dark tunnel, blindfolded
It's where you leave your home
And I follow the steps into your future 
Like I know what's coming 

I follow you like a stray 
And your back says I'm looking
Never mind what's ahead 
Just don't stop 
No don't stop
Because I'm walking in your footsteps
Covering your tracks down river
I'm walking in your footsteps
Turning dust into diamonds 

This road is not your own, it's been covered
It's been chartered so many times 
Every single line every warning sign is warn down and forgotten
I follow you like a stray 
And your back says I'm looking
Never mind what's ahead 
Just don't stop 
No don't stop

Because I'm walking in your footsteps
Covering your tracks down river
I'm walking in your footsteps
Turning dust into diamonds 
Turnin' the dust into diamonds
Turnin' turnin' 

So never mind what's ahead 
Just don't stop 
No don't stop
Because I'm walking in your footsteps
Covering your tracks down river
I'm walking in your footsteps
Turning dust into diamonds 

Oh I'm walking in your footsteps
Every single one
Turning dust into diamonds
Turning dust into diamonds
