When the night is over
When the moonlight's gone
When seductive rhythms
Of the storm die down
When the white wild horses
Are laying down to rest
When your mind is sober
And I'm getting dressed

Will you still kiss my neck?
My dear, my dear
Will you dance when I ask?
My dear, my dear
Will you walk out ahead?
My dear, my dear, my dear
Or will you stay in bed?

When the house is crowded
When you've got no space
When the baby's crying
When I've pulled my ace

Will you still kiss my neck?
My dear, my dear
Will you dance when I ask?
My dear, my dear
Will you walk out ahead?
My dear, my dear, my dear
Or will you stay in bed?

When my white face withers
When my skin turns gray
When the drama's over
Then will you still stay?

Will you still kiss my neck?
My dear, my dear
Will you dance when I ask?
My dear, my dear
Will you walk out ahead?
My dear, my dear, my dear
Or will you stay in bed?

Will you stay in bed?
Will you stay in bed?
Will you stay in bed
