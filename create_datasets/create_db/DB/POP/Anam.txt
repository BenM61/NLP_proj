When will I see
An end to destruction and woe
And how will I see
No division in my life
There comes a time to make amends
Never too late to try again
To save our soul when will I see an end
To the famine and war
And when will I say
There's no solution no more
There comes a time to make amends
Never too late to try again
To save our soul
All that I see
Is soul destroying, greed
When will I say
There's a solution to meet
There comes a time to make amends
Never too late to try again
To save our soul
