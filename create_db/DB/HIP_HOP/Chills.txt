Her smile
Can make a grown man blush like his very first crush
This girl, she drives me wild, yeah
So loud
You can hear my heart beat through my chest when we touch
Like thunder through the clouds

Every night, every day
Playing through my head, babe
Like a broken record, stuck on replay
I think about you like 25, hey, hey, hey, hey

Had me feeling like a kid again
Always talking about you to my friends
That's how I know it's real, you give me chills (oh, oh, oh)

Baby, up and down my spine
Everyday you're looking more and more fine
I put that on a mill, you give me chills
(You give me chills)

Ooh, chills, ooh, chills, ooh
You give me chills

Like snow
I can melt so fast when I'm holding you close
The things that love can do, no
Can't help
Girl, I get so tongue-tied and my feet get tangled
I'm tripping over you

Every night, every day
Playing through my head, babe
Like a broken record, stuck on replay
I think about you like 25, hey, hey, hey, hey

Had me feeling like a kid again
Always talking about you to my friends
That's how I know it's real, you give me chills (oh, oh, oh)

Baby, up and down my spine
Everyday you're looking more and more fine
I put that on a mill, you give me chills
(You give me chills)

C is for the child that you bring out in me
H 'cause I'm happy when you riding next to me
I, I, I make my head spin dizzy
L times two, girl I double love you
S 'cause it feels so real, you give me chills

Always talking about you to my friends
That's how I know it's real, you give me chills

Baby, up and down my spine (my spine)
Everyday you're looking more and more fine (more fine)
I put that on a mill, you give me chills
(Chills, you give me chills)

Ooh, chills, ooh, chills, ooh
You give me chills

Oh, you know you got me actin' like a kid again
Oh I was talking about you to my friends
It's real, you give me chills
