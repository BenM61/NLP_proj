I wanted you so
Wanted you to hold me tight
Take my love and treat me right

I needed your love so
But you're just the hurtin' kind
Nearly drove me out of my mind

Your hurtin' kinda love
Your hurtin' kinda love, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It left me crying

I'd never been blue
I never had to cry all day
Tryin' to wash the hurt away
But then I fell for you
Giving you the love I had
Just to have you treat me so bad

Your hurtin' kinda love
Your hurtin' kinda love, oh, oh, oh, oh
It left me crying

So, now you're with another love
It just may be your lover
Could be the one to do what you have
Done to me, yeah

I want you to know
Even though you broke my heart
I can make a brand new start
I'm so glad to see you go
You will bring me no more pain
I will never cry again

Your hurtin' kinda love
Your hurtin' kinda love, oh, oh
It's over, baby, yeah

Your hurtin' kinda love
Your hurtin' kinda love
Come on baby, take this hurt off me, yeah
Come on baby, take this hurt off me, yeah
Come on baby, take this hurt off me
