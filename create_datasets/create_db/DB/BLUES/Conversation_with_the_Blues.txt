Oh blues, I want to have a little talk with you
Yeah now blues, I want to have a little talk with you
Ah you done cause me to lose my woman, ah blues I guess you're through

Oh blues, Big Bill wants to talk to you
Oh blues, Big Bill wants to talk to you
Now I believe you've been drinkin' moonshine, blues cause you don't care what yo udo

Now looka here blues, I want to talk to you
You been makin' me drinkin', gamblin', and stay out all night too
Now you got me to the place, I don't care what I do
Yeah now blues, I want to have a little talk with you
Now I believe you've been drinkin' moonshine, blues cause you don't care what you do

Yeah now blues, why don't you give poor Bill a break?
Yeah now blues, why don't you give poor Bill a break?
Now why don't try to help me to live, instead of tryin' to break my neck?
