Modern art 
Makes me 
Want to rock out 
Want to rock out 
Want to rock out 
Want to rock out 

So I'm in the Tate 
And I'm looking at Hockney 
And wow!
There's something about that blue 
Amazes me when I step outside 
Oh I'm losing my time
Sweet Jesus, my heart
Is beating faster and faster
I'm palpating
I'm sweating 
I just can't help myself 
I just can't help myself 

Modern art 
Makes me 
Want to rock out 
Want to rock out 
Want to rock out 
Want to rock out 

So I'm in the Pompidou 
That's in Paris 
And the French
They are far more laid back about their art galleries 
There's little children running around 
I see a piece by Matisse 
There's my window of opportunity
I take four steps back 
I bow my head down
And I run at it! 

Modern art 
Makes me 
Want to rock out 
Want to rock out 
Want to rock out 
Want to rock out
