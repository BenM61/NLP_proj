Hit that jive Jack
Put it in your pocket till I get back
Going downtown to see a man
And I ain't got time to shake your hand

Hit that jive Jack
Put it in your pocket till I get back
Time and time waits for no man
And I ain't got time to shake your hand

Standing on a corner
All full of jive
But you know that you're my boy
So I'm forced to give you five
Shadde yadda

Hit that jive Jack
Put it in your pocket till I get back
Going downtown to see a man
And I ain't got time to shake your hand
