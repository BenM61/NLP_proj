Feel the pressure,
Ready to explode,
Its a crazy feeling,
I just need to know,
Let the music take you,
Where you want to go,
Feels like a fire in my soul

'Cause I'm going outta my head & I need to know do you feel the same way
'Cause I'm going outta my head & I need to know is it making you crazy
And I fall to my knees and I'm holding on begging you to stay
'Cause I'm going outta my head & I need to know do you feel the same way

'Cause I'm going outta my head,
'Cause I'm going outta my head,
'Cause I'm going outta my,
'Cause I'm going outta my,
I'm going I'm going

Feel the pressure,
Ready to explode,
Its a crazy feeling,
I just need to know,
Let the music take you,
Where you want to go,
Feels like a fire in my soul

'Cause I'm going outta my head & I need to know do you feel the same way
'Cause I'm going outta my head & I need to know is it making you crazy
And I fall to my knees and I'm holding on begging you to stay
'Cause I'm going outta my head & I need to know do you feel the same way

Do you, do you feel the same way

'Cause I'm going outta my head & I need to know do you feel the same way
