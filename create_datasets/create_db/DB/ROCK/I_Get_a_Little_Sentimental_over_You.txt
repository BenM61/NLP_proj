Honey, though I think about you day and night
I gotta say I'm still alright
But when I'm here without you by the soft fire glow
I hear the golden oldies on the radio
Well I can't hide the moment when
The mood inside me changes 

Then I get a little sentimental when they play
That old love song we sang back then
I hold back the tears until the music's through
Then I get a little sentimental over you

Like a fool I find those old love letters
And I read every line (I read every line)
Oh I know you would laugh
But I was born the sentimental k-i-ind

Honey, there's a hundred crazy things I do
To keep myself from missing you
But when I sit alone and watch the late night show
And someone in the movie says I love you so
Well I can't hide the feeling when
The mood inside me changes

Then I get a little sentimental when they say
The same old words we said back then
So I hold back the tears until the movie's through
Then I get a little sentimental over you

La-la-la-la-la-la, La-la-la-lah-lah-lah...

I got a funny feelin' that there'll come a day
That you will change your mind and come home to say
Then you and I will close the door
And by the fireside like before

We'll get a little sentimental when they play
The same old songs we sang back then
Oh when you hold me tight and say you want me too
I'll get a little sentimental over you
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'll get a little sentimental over you
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'll get a little sentimental over you (fade)
