Six am day after Christmas 
I throw some clothes on in the dark 
The smell of cold 
Car seat is freezing 
The world is sleeping 
I am numb 

Up the stairs to her apartment 
She is balled up on the couch 
Her mom and dad went down to Charlotte 
They're not home to find us out 

And we drive 
Now that I have found someone 
I'm feeling more alone 
Than I ever have before 
She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly
They call her name at seven thirty  
I pace around the parking lot 
Then I walk down to buy her flowers 
And sell some gifts that I got

Can't you see 
It's not me you're dying for 
Now she's feeling more alone 
Then she ever has before 
She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly 
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere 
She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly 

As weeks went by 
It showed that she was not fine 
They told me son it's time to tell the truth 
She broke down and I broke down 
'Cause I was tired of lying 
Driving home to her apartment 
For the moment we're alone 
She's alone 
I'm alone 
Now I know it

She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly 
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere 
She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly
