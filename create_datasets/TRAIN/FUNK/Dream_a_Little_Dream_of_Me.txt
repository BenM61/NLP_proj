Stars shining bright above you,
Night breezes seem to whisper, "I love you",
Birds singing in the sycamore tree,
"Dream a little dream of me".

Just say 'goodnight' and kiss me,
Oh, hold me tight and tell me you miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be,
Dream a little dream of me.

Stars fading, but I linger on, dear,
Still craving your kiss;
I'm longing to linger 'til dawn, my dear,
Just saying this:

Sweet dreams 'til sunbeams find you,
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you,
But in your dreams whatever they be,
Dream a little dream of me.

Say "nightie-night" and kiss me,
Oh, hold me tight and tell me you miss me;
While I'm alone and blue as can be,
Dream a little dream of me.

Dream a little dream of you and me.
