The teenage heart
Is an unguarded dart
We’re trying hard
To make something of what we are
Dying trapped between
The main blanket and new sheet
We’ll never amount
To anything

Come on, come on
(Come on, come on)
Be just like me
Come on, come on
(Come on, come on)
Be a no body
Come on, come on
(Come on, come on)
Be just like me
Come on, come on
(Come on, come on)
Be a no body

You ring, you ring a bell to show
You’re bleeding
I watched, I saw your mind fall,
Out of your head
Weekends and cheap thrills,
Risk it all for an inch of fun,
We’ll never amount
To anything

Come on, come on
(Come on, come on)
Be just like me
Come on, come on
(Come on, come on)
Be a no body
Come on, come on
(Come on, come on)
Be just like me
Come on, come on
(Come on, come on)
Be a no body
Be a no body

Come on, come on
(Come on, come on)
Be just like me
Come on, come on
(Come on, come on)
Be a no body
Come on, come on
(Come on, come on)
Be just like me
Come on, come on
(Come on, come on)
Be a no body
Be a no body

Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Be a no body
Come on, come on
Be just like me
Come on, come on
Be a no body
