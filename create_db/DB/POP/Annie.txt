Annie, don't run away
Where I can't find you, the game has gone too far
Talking, a lot of talk
Playing telephone, twenty city blocks
Annie, they have the dossier
The investigation's already underway
And I tried Justine, she said to give you a ring
And I try to sleep but all I can hear's the beep

Answering, answering machine
Answering, answering machine
Just your answering, answering machine
(Won't you come and find me?)
Answering, answering machine
(Annie, won't you come and find me?)

Hey man, this is Ric
Uh, Callie just called me and she said that she saw Annie acting in a dirty movie

Highway Madonna, evasion is her trade
There was no other, now a shadow at her place
With the brush you left, I comb the alleyways
I don't miss a beat, the tableau stays in place
Annie, I was closing in
But I smeared the number walking in the rain
The girl down the hall, she said to give you a call
And I try to sleep but all I can hear's the beep

From your answering, answering machine
Answering, answering machine
Just your answering, answering machine
Answering, answering machine

Answering, answering machine (Won't you come and find me?)
Answering, answering machine (Annie, won't you come and find me?)
Just your answering, answering machine (Won't you come and find me?)
Answering, answering machine (Annie, won't you come and find me?)
