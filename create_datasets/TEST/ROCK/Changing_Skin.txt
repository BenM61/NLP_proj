I close my eyes, and let the demons in
To clear my mind from the things that I have seen
On my knees, Father, please leave the crowd
And let me out

I lost my way so many times before
That I forgot just what I'm living for
I'm in the dark, light's so hard to find
So now I'm leaving it all behind, I'm changing skin

My angry tears like raindrops in the dust
I realized there's no one you can trust
Shot in the back sinking in the night
That's how I'm leaving it all behind, I'm changing skin
