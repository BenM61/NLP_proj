Mornin!

Living on the ceiling
Under your floor
Outside your back door
Upstairs in the bedroom
Underneath the sink
Anywhere you care to think

Here Cum Germs!
Here Cum Germs!

They live on your dog
They live off your cat
In your house
Or in your council flat

Here Cum Germs!
Here Cum Germs!

Some are pink
Some are blue
Some are green
Green as the peas in a pod

Night is night
Day is day
Night is night
Day is day

Peace and love is a silly thing
Peace and love is a silly thing
Peace and love is a silly thing
Peace and love is a silly thing
Peace and love is a - silly thing

Here Cum Germs!
Here Cum Germs!
Here Cum Germs!
Here Cum Germs!
Through your door

Upstairs in the attic
In the arm of your coat
In the drink slipping down
The back of your throat

Coming through the window
Coming through the door
Living underneath the floor
Underneath the sink
They're underneath the sink
Now what do you think
Living under my sink

Here Cum - Germs!
