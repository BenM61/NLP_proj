The moonlight, The music and you
Lover, I'm yearning for you
Would you give me a sign?

After dark will you be mine?
After dark your light will shine
Love is such a wonderful vine,
It's high upon to me, one of a kind

After dark you're gonna be mine
After dark your light will shine
Moonlight and you, baby, the music is you

The night is falling
Now and the moonlight is shining near
Baby, you and me

After dark we'll dream again
After dark there'll be no end
Through this magic wonderland
Fall in love with me again

After dark my dreams come true
After dark I'll be with you
Moonlight and you, baby The music is you

Can't you feel me burning
How I long for you

After dark we'll feel desire
After dark we'll feel the fire
Moonlight and you, baby The music is you

After dark,
Don't you know you can touch me
And you'll see

After dark,
Baby, we'll be together
Just the moonlight and you

You're gonna be all mine
Let it shine on through Moonlight and you

After dark, touch me and you
Take me through this magic wonderland, the music and you
