Go down to wait all night
She's bound to run him out
Invested enough in it anyhow
To each his own
The garden is sorting out
She curls her lips on a bar
I don't know if you're dead or not
If you're anyone

Come on and get the minimum
Before you open up your eyes
This army has so many hands
To analyze
Come on and get your overdose
Collected at the borderline
They want it up in your hair

'Cause they know, and so do I
The high road is hard to find
A detour in your new life
Tell all of your friends goodbye

The dawn to end all nights
That's all we hoped it was
A break from the warfare in your house
To each his own
The soldier is bailing out
And curled his lips on a bar
And I don't know if the dead can talk
To anyone

Come on and get the minimum
Before you open up your eyes
This army has so many hands
Are you one of us?
Come on and get your overdose
Collected at the borderline
They want to get up in your hair

Cause they know, and so do I
The high road is hard to find
A detour in your new life
Tell all of your friends goodbye

It's too late to change your mind
You let laws be your guide

It's too late to change your mind
You let laws be your guide

It's too late to change your mind
You let laws be your guide

It's too late to change your mind
You let laws be your guide
