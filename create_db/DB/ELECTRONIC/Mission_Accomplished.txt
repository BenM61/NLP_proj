Are you ready
Oh my spirit
Oh my lonely
Conceil it for me

In other words flip flop
They said that I get dropped

Big time, I'm on my way
I'm making it, big time
Big time, I'm on my way
I'm making it, big time 

Big time, I'm on my way
I'm making it, big time
Big time, I'm on my way
I'm making it, big time 

Oh my lonely
Conceil it for me
? I'm still feeling ?
? You won't mix it ?
Brand new retro
I won't let go

Are you ready
? I'm still feeling ?
? You won't mix it ?
Are you ready
? All my skin is ?
? I'm still feeling ?
? You won't mix it ?

Are you ready X2
Big time, I'm on my way
I'm making it, big time
Big time, I'm on my way
I'm making it, big time

Big time, I'm on my way
I'm making it, big time
Big time, I'm on my way
I'm making it, big time ...
