Got to get you into my life, into my life
Got to get you into my life, into my life
Got to get you into my life, into my life
Got to get you into my life, into my life
Got to get you into my life, into my life

I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe
I could see another sign there
Oo, then I suddenly see you
Oo, and did I tell you I need you
Ev'ry single day of my life

You didn't run, you didn't lie
You knewI wanna to hold you
And had you gone you knew in time
We'd meet again for I had told you
Oh, you were meant to be near me
Oh, I really want for you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day

Got to get you into my life
Got to get you in, got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life
Got to get you in, got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life

Ooo, then I suddenly see you
Ooo, and did I tell you that I need you
Every single day of my life

Got to get you into my life
Got to get you in, got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life

Got to get you in, got to get you in
Got to get you in, got to get you in
Into my life
Got to get you into my life
Got to get you in, got to get you in
Got to get you in, got to get you in
Into my life
Got to get you into my life
Got to get you in, got to get you in
