Oh, my Adeline, ooh
Down in Tasmania
Where the devil's jaws are far too weak
To tear you away

Ooh, I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well

Oh, my Adeline
I watch your morning swim again
Oh, cold from the blue sky
Strokes from passing mopeds
My sweet Adeline

Ooh, I wish you well (my Adeline)
I wish you well
I wish you well (my Adeline)
I wish you well

And the auld triangle went jingle jangle
On the Royal Canal
My Adeline was swimming
Sweet Adeline was singing
To the tune of Royal Canal

Swim
Swim on
Swim on
Swim on
Swim
Swim on
Swim on
Swim on

And the auld triangle went jingle jangle
On the Royal Canal
My Adeline was swimming
Sweet Adeline was singing
To the tune of Royal Canal

I wish her well
I wish her well
I wish her well
I wish her well
I wish her well
