Everybody wants to laugh
Ah, but nobody wants to cry
I say everybody wants to laugh
But nobody wants to cry

Everybody wants to go to heaven
But nobody wants to die

Everybody want to hear the truth
But yet, everybody wants to tell a lie
I say everybody wants to hear the truth
But still they all want to tell a lie

Oh everybody wants to go to heaven
But nobody wants to die

Everybody want to know the reason
Without even askin' why
Oh, everybody want to know the reason
Oh, without even askin' why

You know everybody want to go to heaven
But nobody wants to die
