Let's go play in the water
You can borrow my Rolling Stones t-shirt
Happy drunk in the afternoon
Don't take it off

Sun is beating us harder
Whatchu do with my Rolling Stones t-shirt
It was vintage '69
You took it off

Now the temperature's hotter
Everybody is losing their t-shirt
Nobody is fine as you
You get me off

Don't get wet like the others
Not in my Rolling Stones t-shirt
It was see-through anyway
But you took it off

Let's go play in the water
You can borrow my Rolling Stones t-shirt
Happy drunk in the afternoon
Don't take it off

Sun is beating us harder
Whatchu do with my Rolling Stones t-shirt
It was vintage '69
You took it off
