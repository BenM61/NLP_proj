(c. bonnacci, s. fox, m. shreeve)

I wake up, I wake up
What does it mean to dream
Is it staying alive or to fall or rise
So take it to the limit and lets dream on, dream on

I wake up, to find you
To find you next to me
I reach out, yeah
You're there like a vision of ecstasy

But when I wake up
I realise, I'm holding on to a dream
(don't you know it's just a)
You're just a dream to me
(you're just a dream to me)
A part inside of me
(a part inside of me)

You're just a part of a dream in me
You're a dream in me
I feel cold
As your, as your shadow moves away
I feel heat
Heat now

I need you
I really need you here to stay

You're just a dream to me
(you're just a dream to me)
A part inside of me
(a part inside of me)

You're just a dream
You're just a part of a dream in me
You're a dream in me
You're a dream in me
You're a dream in me
You're a dream in me
You're a dream in me

It's so nice to dream
But then again
Your dreams are not always reality
It seems we're always searching
Searching for that real dream
Dream, dream...
