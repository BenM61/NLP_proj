I stayed in last night 
I wasn't feeling all right 
I knew it couldn't last 
I started thinking of you 

And I wished we could be dancing in the dark 
(Really slow) 
Oh, it's good to know 
Tomorrow, you are coming home 

(I won't be so alone) 
I feel heaven in you 
Don't you know 
I feel heaven in you 

Oh, it's true 
I can't let go 
I miss you, oh you know 
Sitting alone 

With the TV on 
I fell asleep 
I was hoping you'd call 
And I dreamed we could be dancing in the dark 

(Really slow) 
Oh, it's good to know 
Tomorrow, you are coming home 
(I won't be so alone) 

I feel heaven in you 
Don't you know 
I feel heaven in you 
Oh, it's true 

I can't let go 
I miss you, oh you know 
Angel interceptor 
Apollo 21 

Uri Gagarin 
Flew into the sun 
The angels in heaven 
Look down where he lay 

Oh tomorrow you are coming home 
I feel heaven in you 
Don't you know 
I feel heaven in you 

Oh it's true 
I can't let go 
I miss you, oh you know
