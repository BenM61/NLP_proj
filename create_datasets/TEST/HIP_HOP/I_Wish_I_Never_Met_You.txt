They say it's insane when
You think somebody is gonna change when
They won't
I'm getting tired of this recital
Is it really worth figthing for
Young lovers seems care free
These bags have gotten heavy again
I think is time to brake the pattern
Blame it on return the silence

A lonely road to nowhere
That's all we are

I wish I never met you
You done me so wrong
I wish I could forget you
It's been way too long
It's been sixteen hours and three long years
Been trying wipe these memories and dry these tears
I wish I never met you
That's how much I regret you

Contempt is in silence
You offer no violence to me
You have me feinding like a crackhead
I squeeze you out just like a black head
Nobody's gonna save you
And I know better than to blame you alone
I lay there and take the lashes
But now I leave you with the ashes

A lonely road to nowhere
That's all we are

I wish I never met you
You done me so wrong
I wish I could forget you
It's been way too long
It's been sixteen hours and three long years
Been trying wipe these memories and dry these tears
I wish I never met you
That's how much I regret you

And now the flames just a flicker
Down to the wick now tell me
Who's gonna kill it
It burns until you snub it out
I wanna rub you out
The love's gonna trick you
F*ck with your ticker
Pull you down like a brick that's tied to you
Pulling you down
Watch me drown

It's been sixteen hours and three long years
Been trying wipe these memories and dry these tears
I wish I never met you
That's how much I regret you

It's been sixteen hours and three long years
Been trying wipe these memories and dry these tears
I wish I never met you
That's how much I regret you
