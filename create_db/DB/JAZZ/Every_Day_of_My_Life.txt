Every day of my life you'll be near to me
For the romance we knew is a mess, you're still dear to me
With each breath I take, I just lie awake
Every thought of you stays my heart
The memories will never part
Every day of my life I live just for you

And I'll always remember
The thrill when our love was new
While a spark may burn
I'm just hoping some day you'll return
And I'll wait dear every day of my life
I'll wait for you dear every day of my life
