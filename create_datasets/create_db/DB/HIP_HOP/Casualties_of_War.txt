Casualties of War! 

Casualties of war; as I approach the barricade 
Where's the enemy? Who do I invade? 
Bullets of Teflon  bulletproof vest rip 
Tear ya outta ya frame with a bag full of clips 
Cause I got a family that waits for my return 
To get back home is my main concern 
I'ma get back to New York in one piece 
but I'm bent in the sand that is hot as the city streets 
Sky lights up like fireworks blind me 
Bullets, whistlin over my head remind me... 
President Bush said attack 
Flashback to Nam, I might not make it back 
Missile hits the area, screams wake me up 
from a war of dreams, heat up the M-16 
Basic training, trained for torture 
Take no prisoners, and I just caught ya 
Addicted to murder, send more bodybags 
They can't identify em, leave the nametags 
I get a rush when I see blood, dead bodies on the floor 
CASUALTIES OF WAR! (4X) 

Day divides the night and night divides the day 
It's all hard work and no play 
More than combat, it's far beyond that 
Cause I got a kill or be killed kind of attack 
Area's mapped out, there'll be no, Stratego 
Me and my platoon make a boom wherever we go 
But what are we here for? Who's on the other side of the wall? 
Somebody give the President a call 
But I hear warfare scream through the air 
Back to the battlegrounds, it's war they declare 
A Desert Storm: let's see who reigns supreme 
Something like Monopoly: a government scheme 
Go to the Army, be all you can be 
Another dead soldier? Hell no, not me 
So I start letting off ammunition in every direction 
Allah is my only protection 
But wait a minute, Saddam Hussein prays the same 
and this is Asia, from where I came 
I'm on the wrong side, so change the target 
Shooting at the general; and where's the sergeant? 
Blame it on John Hardy Hawkins for bringing me to America 
Now it's mass hysteria 
I get a rush when I see blood, dead bodies on the floor 
CASUALTIES OF WAR! (4X) 

The war is over, for now at least 
Just because they lost it don't mean it's peace 
It's a long way home, it's a lot to think about 
Whole generation, left in doubt 
Innocent families killed in the midst 
It'll be more dead people after this 
So I'm glad to be alive and walkin 
Half of my platoon came home in coffins 
Except the general, buried in the Storm 
in bits and pieces no need to look for em 
I played it slick and got away with it 
Rigged it up so they would think they did it 
Now I'm home on reserves and you can bet 
when THEY call, I'm going AWOL 
Cause it ain't no way I'm going back to war 
when I don't know who or what I'm fighting for 
So I wait for terrorists to attack 
Every time a truck backfires I fire back 
I look for shelter when a plane is over me 
Remember Pearl Harbor? New York could be over, G 
Kamikaze, strapped with bombs 
No peace in the East, they want revenge for Saddam 
Did I hear gunshots, or thunder? 
No time to wonder, somebody's going under 
Put on my fatigues and my camoflouge 
Take control, cause I'm in charge 
When I snapped out of it, it was blood, dead bodies on the floor
