When skies are cloudy and gray
They're only gray for a day
So wrap your troubles in dreams
And dream your troubles away

Until that sunshine peeps through
There's only one thing to do
Just wrap your troubles in dreams
And dream your troubles away

Your castles may tumble
That's fate after all
Life's really funny that way
No use to grumble
Just smile as they fall
Weren't you king for a day? Say

Just remember that sunshine
Always follows the rain
So wrap your troubles in dreams
And dream your troubles away
