Waiting around since last night sitting in your garden chair
When you decide to come home I suppose I'll still be there
Everything comes to the man waits for everything to come
But what can he do when the thing he wants the most
He's farthest from

Yes I guess I see your point, patience growing thin
How can you respect a man who needs you more than you need him

Baroquen spirits do you love me
Baroquen spirits I can't say
Baroquen spirits do you love me
Baroquen spirits I can't say

Give me your love or let go but don't play with my affairs
Kiss me goodbye or hello but don't take lightly what we share

Yes I guess I see your point, patience growing thin
How can you respect a man who needs you more than you need him

Baroquen spirits do you love me
Baroquen spirits I can't say
Baroquen spirits do you love me
Baroquen spirits I can't say
What will I do if you tell me that you love me not at all
I'll charter a ship to the edge of the world and sail off
