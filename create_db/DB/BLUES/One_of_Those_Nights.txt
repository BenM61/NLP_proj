Come here, baby
Let me wrap you around my fingers
I want you so much
And love's just a touch away
So touch me, baby
And you'll feel a man on fire
Just hold on to me
'cause it's gonna be one of those nights
Oh one of those nights
When love has us right in its hands
Oh here in the dark
What you do to my heart
Woman, your wonder don't end
And it's one of those nights
One of those nights again
Darling, I know
I know this ain't no time for talking
But you know I've just got to tell you
I just have to tell you
How I feel right now
And I want to say, baby, you're something
And I'm wrapped around your finger
I want you again
'cause I'm so far into one of those nights
Oh one of those nights
When love has us right in its hands
Oh here in the dark
What you do to my heart
Woman, your wonder don't end
And it's one of those nights
One of those nights again
