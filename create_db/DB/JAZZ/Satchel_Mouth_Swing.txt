Old Satchel's in the groove
Old Satchel's in the mood
It's Satchel time to swing
Better hurry up; it's satchel's time to say

When Satchel's feelin' high
Just kiss your cares goodbye
Old Satchel Mouth is lookin' right at you
Look at him smile: he's never blue
Rhythm don't mean a thing
When Satchel Mouth starts to swing
