Children, are you ready?
There's gonna be a meeting over yonder
Children, are you ready?
There's gonna be a meeting over yonder

All the boys and the girls' gonna be there
Young and old, weak and strong's gonna be there
So children, are you ready?
For the meeting over yonder

Get my coat, got to go
To the meeting over yonder
I've got to learn what I don't know
At the meeting over yonder

At the talkin', I'm sure all will agree
The best thing for you, you and me
Is go to the meeting over yonder
Go to the meeting over yonder
Keep on pushin' now

Children, are you ready?
There's gonna be a meeting over yonder
Children, are you ready?
For the meeting over yonder

All the boys and the girls' gonna be there
Young and old, weak and strong's gonna be there
So children, are you ready?
For the meeting over yonder

There's gonna be a meeting over yonder
For the meeting over yonder
For the meeting over yonder
For the meeting over yonder
For the meeting over yonder
