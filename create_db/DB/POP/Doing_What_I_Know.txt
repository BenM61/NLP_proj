[Chorus: x2]
Sometimes I think I don't know what I'm doing,
But I always end up doing what I know,

And It's amazing when you think of it,
How many people smoke,
Despite the risks that are involved,
There's really very little hope,
Without them we just couldn't cope,
Couldn't cope, neither could we
Sometimes I think I don't know what I'm doing,
But I always end up doing what I know,
Doing what I know, doing what I know

[Chorus: x2]

Have you ever wondered,
What would happen in a third world war,
No sooner would it have begun,
Than it would be all over,
Just look over your shoulder, your shoulder,
It's above your knees

[Chorus]

And what I know, may not I know be a great deal
But what I know nobody can take,
Nobody can take, nobody can take away from me,
No, no, no, away from me, no, no, no
I do what I know, doing what I know

[Chorus]

Away we go doing what I know
