Snoop Dogg, Snoop Dogg

Helicopter in the sky, airplane in the clouds
Boats in the ocean, cars travel the ground
I watch from the balcony, this is a busy town
I kinda like Miami, I might lock it down

My girl with me, she cook better than Mr. Chows
Told her I order somethin', baby just dial zero for room service
She looked up and smiled
I was just stuck in the hood

Look at me now
Opened up my safe and put the chain around my neck
Then I locked my watch, bling blaow, pinky ring and bracelet
Kinda loud, I got a lotta jewels, 'cause I got a lotta style

Before I got here, my homie was on trial
Walked in the court, the jurors was like, wow
Hollered at Shaq, they was playin' some clowns
Went to the game, can't blend in with the crowd

Won a couple grand when Shaquille got fouled
Bet you he make these an easy then thou
The best of both worlds is a kilo and a pound
In case I gotta bang I'm totin' the 40 cal

You got a system in your truck? Let it bang
I could see your butt from the front, let it bang
You gang bang then it's all the same thing
We can bang it on out, we can bang it out

I dare y'all to violate, we can bang it out
Ice grillin' in my face, we can bang it out
Tryna stick me for my papes, we can bang it out
We can bang it on out, we can bang it on out

What it is? What it was?
Who you wit? Is you wit us?
'Cause we love to bang and swing and live it up
I get low and roll a tree wit a foe

Break bread or fake dead, that's the slogan, li'l homie
Why you da boss? See I been chosin', li'l homie
And I been doin this the old fashioned way
Stickin', movin', on these suckas just like Cassius Clay

Make it rain? Naw boo, I'm tryna stash my cash away
Knockin' down trap doors and turnin' out rap whores
Sellin' out rap tours on your favorite television show
Goin' hard on 'em though

East coast let loose, my nephew, Papoose, he got the juice
So watch the Impala as it swing by and be on the lookout
For them boys with them gang signs, that's us and you can trust
We gon' bust Big Snoop and Papoose bang, bang in your truck

You got a system in your truck? Let it bang
I could see your butt from the front, let it bang
You gang bang then it's all the same thing
We can bang it on out, we can bang it out

I dare y'all to violate, we can bang it out
Ice grillin' in my face, we can bang it out
Tryna stick me for my papes, we can bang it out
We can bang it on out, we can bang it on out

My style similar to hell, hotter than high temperatures
World wide finisher, the US, I'm the lyrical president
The UK king, wild sinister
They love me in Canada, they call me the prime minister

Said I'd lose my life on the corner
But I'm in Miami on the balcony, overlookin' the water
Give my credit card to my daughter
Tell her to swipe it like Swiper from Dora The Explorer

And I just bought her the ice that don't melt
I give her what she want, she spoiled like old milk
They'll say the block slow if you ain't really smart chill
Cop from another connect, give you the raw deal

Flip your money twice then come for some more crills
Dudes will flip on you, the game ill
Since they like flippin' on me man, I cop that long steel
Hit him in his side and make him do a cartwheel

You got a system in your truck? Let it bang
I could see your butt from the front, let it bang
You gang bang then it's all the same thing
We can bang it on out, we can bang it out

I dare y'all to violate, we can bang it out
Ice grillin' in my face, we can bang it out
Tryna stick me for my papes, we can bang it out
We can bang it on out, we can bang it on out

You got a system in your truck? Let it bang
I could see your butt from the front, let it bang
You gang bang then it's all the same thing
We can bang it on out, we can bang it out

I dare y'all to violate, we can bang it out
Ice grillin' in my face, we can bang it out
Tryna stick me for my papes, we can bang it out
We can bang it on out, we can bang it on out
