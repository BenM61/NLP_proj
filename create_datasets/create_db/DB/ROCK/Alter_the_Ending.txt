I know that yesterday is gone and it won't come back to me
But I miss it after all it never really lasts as long as we'd meant for it to be
There'll be twists and turns to pull at us and tear into the seams
But I'll meet you where we started once again, cause I miss you

Maybe we were right to carry on, to carry on
Even when they said we'd be undone
Take it as a sign we can still go on, we still belong
Even when the worst is yet to come

We're only waiting on the sun to clear away the haze
Cause we can't see where we've gone from where we started
Where we strayed and where we're meant to be
There'll be ash and dust to bury us but I will keep you clean
And I'll meet you where we started once again

Maybe we were right to carry on, to carry on
Even when they said we'd be undone
Take it as a sign we can still go on, we still belong
Even when the worst is yet to come

And when tomorrow comes and we've shown everyone
What they can never take away

Maybe we were right to carry on, to carry on
Even when they said we'd be undone
Take it as a sign we can still go on, we still belong
Even when the best is yet to come

And when tomorrow comes and we've shown everyone
What they can never take away
