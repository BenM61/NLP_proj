Sugar sugar kandy pop
Push it down and pull it up
Sugar sugar kandy pop
Just don't let the music stop

You've got the brains, I've got no brawn
You wanna stop, I keep it on
You've got the brains, or so you say
Maybe you'll see things in another way

I've got better things to do
Than hang around with you and you
I've got better places to be
You know the only one is me

Sugar sugar...

Oh, oh, oh, kandy pop
Oh, oh, oh, kandy pop
Oh, oh, oh, kandy pop
Oh, oh, oh, kandy pop

Sugar sugar...

You've got the pain but I don't want to know
And you can keep on trying to put me off
By saying you've got the brains or so you say
Maybe you'll see things in another way

I've got better things...

Sugar sugar...
