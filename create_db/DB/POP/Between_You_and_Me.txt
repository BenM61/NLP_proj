Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, now
 
From where I stand today I see 
Just how slow we are to learn 
Things are not how they should be 
Between you and me 
I look at you you look at me 
And they are differences indeed 
But we must open up our minds 
To see the similarities 

[Chorus: ] 
Heal divisions between you and me 
Span the distance between you and me 
Building bridges between you and me 
Share the vision between you and me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,yeah, yeah,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, now
 
I thought my innocence was why 
I longed for peace and so I'd start 
To scorn simplicity and I 
Opened my mind and closed my heart 
What is the color of my hurt 
A shade for pain is hard to find 
Who knows the status of my soul 
Measures the merit of my mind
 
[Chorus: ]

As life and death conflict and need 
Feature in all reality 
More than a common ground I see 
One race that is humanity 
And though the future's overcast 
Still I am hoping anyhow 
We've got to look beyond the past 
It is the time for healing now
