When you are ready, I will surrender
Take me and do as you will
Have what you want, your way's always the best way, ah huh
I have succumbed to this passive sensation
Peacefully falling away
I am a zombie your wish will command me
Laugh as I fall to my knees

Bring it back
Sing it back
Bring it back
Sing it back to me

Bring it back
Sing it back
Bring it back
Sing it back to me

Can I control this empty delusion?
Lost in the fire below
And you come running your eyes will be open, woo

And when you come back, I'll be as you want me
Only so eager to please
My little song will keep you beside me
Thinking your name as I sing

Bring it back
Sing it back
Bring it back
Sing it back to me

Bring it back
Sing it back
Bring it back
Sing it back to me

Bring it back
Sing it back
Bring it back
Sing it back to me

Bring it back
Sing it back
Bring it back
Sing it back to me

Come, come, come to my sweet melody
Come, come, come to my sweet melody
Come, come, come to my sweet melody
Come, come, come to my sweet melody

Sing it back to me
A sweet melody
Yeah, oh

Bring it back
Sing it back
Bring it back
Sing it back to me (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Bring it back
Sing it back
Bring it back
Sing it back to me, oh

Bring it back
Sing it back
Bring it back
Sing it back to me (yeah, yeah)

Bring it back
Sing it back
Bring it back
Sing it back to me, yeah
