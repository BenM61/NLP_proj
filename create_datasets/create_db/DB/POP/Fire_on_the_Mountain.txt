Fire on the mountain
Through the freeze
Save yourself
There's evil
In the garden
But you don't see it
I can tell

How do you sleep while
The city's burning
Where do you go when you can't go home
How do you drink when
There's blood in the water
Where do you turn when
The world moves on
When the world moves on, on

Fire on the mountain
You can feel it
Against your skin
You're standing
By the river
Let the river
Take you in

How do you sleep while
The city's burning
Where do you go when you can't go home
How do you drink when
There's blood in the water
Where do you turn when
The world moves on
When the world moves on
When the world moves on, on yeah

[Repeat: x2]
Hell, I see smoke out on the horizon
Mama, get your baby, take
Her down to the water
I view the wind like a promise broken
I see the future but
It's getting farther

How do you sleep while
The city's burning
Where do you go when you can't go home
How do you drink when
There's blood in the water
Where do you turn when
The world moves on
When the world moves on, hey
When the world moves on 
When the world moves on 
When the world moves on 
Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah world moves on
That world moves on, yeah
