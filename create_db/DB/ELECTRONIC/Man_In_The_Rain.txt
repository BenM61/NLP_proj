You're the one who's nearly breaking my heart.
Had your chance, you just threw it all away.
Living in a world that you could never be a part of
And never time to walk away.

You can't stay, no, you can't stay.
You're no loser, there's still time to ride that train
And you must be on your way tonight.
Think anew right through, you're a man in the rain.

What's the use in hanging round these walls.
Lamps are burning, but nobody's at home.
There's a new day dawning as a cold rain falls
And now's the time to walk alone.

You can't stay, no, you can't stay.
You're no loser, there's still time to ride that train
And you must be on your way tonight.
Think anew right through, you're a man in the rain.

How's it feel when there's time to remember?
Branches bare, like the trees in November.

Had it all, threw it all away.
Now's the time to walk away.

You can't stay, no, you can't stay.
You're no loser, there's still time to ride that train
And you must be on your way tonight.
Think anew right through, you're a man in the rain.

How's it feel when there's time to remember?
Branches bare, like the trees in November.
