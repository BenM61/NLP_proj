Pushing through the market square
So many mothers sighing
News had just come over
We had five years left to cry in

News guy wept and told us
Earth she was really dying
Cried so much his face was wet
Well, I knew he wasn't lying

I heard telephones, opera house, favorite melodies
I saw boys and toys, electric irons, TVs
My brain felt like a warehouse it had no room to spare
I had to cram so many things to store everything in there

And all the fat, skinny people
And all the tall, short people
And all the nobody people
And all the somebody people
Christ, I never thought I'd need so many people

Girl my age went off her head
She hit some tiny children
And if the black hadn't pulled her off
Then I think I know she would have killed them

I saw a soldier with a broken arm
Staring to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
And a queer well he threw up at the sight of that

I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlor
Drinking milk shakes cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine
I don't think you knew you were in this song

And it was cold and it rained so I felt like an actor
And I thought of ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face, your ace, the way that you talk
Well, I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk

We got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
Five years, my brain hurts a lot
We got five years, that's all we've got

Five years, that's all we've got
Five years
Five years
Five years

Five years
Five years
Five years
Five years

Five years
Five years
Five years
Five years

Five years
Five years
Five years
Five years

Five years
