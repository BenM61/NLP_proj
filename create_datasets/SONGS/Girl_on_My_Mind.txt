She's the girl on my mind
She's pretty and so fine
She'll love me any time, any way
She does everything to please
She's got everything I need
She always tries to be my sunny day

Lovin' could be a place for me
The angel face I see
When I come home from work, worn and tired
She makes me feel brand new
When she loves me like she always loves to love me
Ooh, ooh

She's the girl on my mind
She's pretty and so fine
She'll love me any time, any way
She does everything to please
She got everything I need
She always tries to be my sunny day

And there's no prettier sight to see
Than when she comes to me
Wrapped up in a towel
All wet and warm
And she looks at me that way
And I can tell the way she's smilin' what she's thinking
Ooh, ooh

She's the girl on my mind
She's pretty and so fine
She'll love me any time, any way
She does everything to please
She got everything I need
She always tries to be my sunny day

She's the girl on my mind
She's pretty and so fine
She'll love me any time, any way
She does everything to please
She got everything
