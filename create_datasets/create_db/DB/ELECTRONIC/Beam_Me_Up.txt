Tonight we'll run away 
Speeding faster than a midnight train 
Somewhere to such a place 
Where the stars come out to light your face 
We'll leave behind a world in darkness 
Go where no one's broken hearted 
Take off without a trace 
Neon angels, up, up and away 

Diamond clouds 
I think we're getting closer 
Don't stop now 
Off the ground 
Higher than a supernova 
Don't look down
Don't look down
Don't look down
Don't look down

Beam me up
Beam me up
Beam me up
Beam me up

Diamond clouds 
I think we're getting closer 
Don't stop now 
Off the ground 
Higher than a supernova 
Don't look down
Don't look down

After we kissed the sun 
We can burn our names into the sky 
Feel my electric touch 
Taste my supersonic lullaby 

Diamond clouds 
I think we're getting closer 
Don't stop now 
Off the ground 
Higher than a supernova 
Don't look down
Don't look down
Don't look down
Don't look down

Beam me up
Beam me up
Beam me up
Beam me up

Diamond clouds 
I think we're getting closer 
Don't stop now 
Off the ground 
Higher than a supernova 
Don't look down
Don't look down

Don't look down
