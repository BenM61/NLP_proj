Damn
Whoo!
Profyle
Hmm, kick the
Come on

I love the way you walk (walk)
want to hear you talk
Something 'bout your thighs
Made a nigga rise
The way you wear you hair
Ain't a woman here that compares
I'm feelin' what you do
So let me do it with you

[Chorus:]
Make a nigga say damn
Damn, damn, damn, ooh
Make a nigga say oh damn
Got damn, hot damn

[Chorus:]

Jump into my six
I'mma drop these chips
Let's get up on this room
You're about to meet your doom
Now when you raise up out this bed
You might find yourself kinda bowleg
Now don't get mad at me
Cause I penetrated rather deeply

[Chorus:](2x)

By the time that we are through
Screaming the words girl ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh damn, oh damn
By the time that we are through
Screaming the words girl ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh damn, oh damn

Now that we are through
Gotta a question for you
Tell me was it good
Was it hmm-hmm good to you
Lying there in the bare
Girl you need to beware
I'll hop back in that bed
And from the back I pull your hair

[Chorus:] till end
