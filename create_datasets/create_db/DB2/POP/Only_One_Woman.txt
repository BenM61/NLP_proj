Ten little Indians standing around
I bet there are many but how would I know
As she was only one woman
Only one woman

And I've got a picture
Of the woman I love
Who sees my lonely face, who sees my shame
Nobody in my place, can tell me her name

'Cause she was only one woman
Only one woman
And I've got a picture
Of the woman I love

Ten little Indians, now there are none
I bet there are many, but her love still goes on
She was only one woman
Only one woman

And I've got a picture
Of the woman I love
Only one woman
Only one woman

And I've got a picture
Of the woman I love
Only one woman
Only one woman.

And I've got a picture
Of the woman I love. Only one woman
Only one woman
And I've got a picture
Of the woman I love
