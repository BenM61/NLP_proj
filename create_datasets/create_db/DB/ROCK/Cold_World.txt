There's a war going on outside no man is safe from
You can run but you can't hide forever
From the fact that we're all gonna die alone
No one's looking out for you
Every man for himself
You have your friends by your side
But in the end are they gonna be there for you?

Love, hate, kings, queens
You die alone in a cold world
Greed, lust, envy, trust
You get crushed in a cold world
Drugs, money, power, sex
What'd you expect in a cold world
Fight, f*ck, coke, dust
All fucked up in a cold world
