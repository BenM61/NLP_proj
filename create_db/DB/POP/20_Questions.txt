Be as I can be, I'll never be as bad as you
You use your words like they're weapons
And shoot to kill, that's half the thrill
And I never aim at you
You forgot to mention all the times that you were drunk
You drove your car across the border
Upon the hill, I payed the bill
I never told a soul
Somebody was sitting on the kitchen counter
When I got back home I found you
I don't know her name
But I will ask you twenty questions
Till you fall apart and answer me
You always give yourself away
Somehow I always know

I take these pills to make you nicer, nicer
Without them you are such a nightmare, a nightmare
I would stay at home, you'll be on the road
Ah-ah-ah-aah, is it me or you?
I take these pills to make you nicer, nicer

Sometimes I would follow you around a Friday night
To see you talk to other people
You look so free, you look at ease
You never do with me
Called you from across the street
I saw you, you were staring at the screen
As it kept ringing for a minute
Then I listened to your voicemail
Bet you wouldn't do the same to her
You would've picked up instantly
She would've made you smile

I take these pills to make you nicer, nicer
Without them you are such a nightmare, a nightmare
I would stay at home, you'll be on the road
Ah-ah-ah-aah, is it me or you?
I take these pills to make you nicer, nicer

Is it me or you?
Is it me or you?
Is it me or you?
Is it me or
No, it's you

I take these pills to make you nicer, nicer
Without them you are such a nightmare, a nightmare
I would stay at home, you'll be on the road
Ah-ah-ah-aah, is it me or you?
I take these pills to make you nicer, nicer
