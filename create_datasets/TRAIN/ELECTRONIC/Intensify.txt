You're looking for perfection
This leaves me outside
All I am
All you are to me is beauty
Let me inside
Stop wasting time
Intensify
Intensify

I can't bare your rejection
It makes me cold down to my bones
Even in my soul I believe in you
I'm not a liar
I speak my mind
Intensify
Intensify
Intensify
Intensify

Will we gonna be ok?
Will we gonna be alright?
Will we gonna be ok?
We'll be alright
Intensify
Intensify
Intensify
Intensify
