You've given me things that mean a lot
A love I could endure
You've given me a home, a family
Made me feel secure

Yet all that you give
There's a question that needs an answer
How can you give your love to another
Come home and face me the morning after

How do you feel (How do you feel)
The morning after (How do you feel)
After you've given your love to someone new

Tell me now, how do you feel (How do you feel)
The morning after (How do you feel)
I lay here all night long waiting on you

I know, I know, I know
You must be dying inside
If you tell me, you'll be confessing
So you can't apologize

Ooh, it hurts me so
To know that I'm the one to suffer
To know that I must be second best
When the best has gone to another

How do you feel (How do you feel)
The morning after (How do you feel)
After you've given your love to someone new

Tell me now, how do you feel (How do you feel)
The morning after (How do you feel)
After I lay here all night long waiting on you

Did she make you wanna cry the morning after
After you've given your love to someone new

Tell me now, how do you feel the morning after
After I lay here all night long waiting on you

Oh, baby, how do you feel the morning after
After I lay here all night long waiting on you
