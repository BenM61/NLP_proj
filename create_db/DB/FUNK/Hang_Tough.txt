Even the masters miss
Sometimes...baby
So don't be so hard on yourself

Even the best get beat
Sometimes...baby
That's just the way the story goes

Even the highs get low
Sometimes...baby
That's just the nature of the game

When on the way to up
There's downs...baby
Until you reach the glory road

(You got to) Hang tough...never give up
Hang tough...never give up
(You got to) Hang tough...never give up
Hang tough...never give up

Even the experts miss
Sometimes...baby
And they're supposed to call the shots

Everything seems to fall short
At times...baby
And when it rains it really pours

Even the darkest cloud
On high...baby
Don't mean there's darkness in your heart

Even the champs go down
Sometimes...baby
To fall don't mean
To fall apart
