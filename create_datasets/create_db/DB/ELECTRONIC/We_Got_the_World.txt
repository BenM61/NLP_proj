They say you're a freak when we're having fun
Say you must be high when we're spreading love
But we're just living life and we never stop
We got the world
We got the wo-wo-wo-wo-wo

We can live fast, fly young
Everyday we celebrate just like we want
Only you and I, DWI
We found a way to live the dream until we die

Just come into my arms
I will get you love drunk
We'll be burning ground
Us against the world tonight

They say you're a freak when we're having fun
Say you must be high when we're spreading love
But we're just living life and we never stop
We got the world
We got the wo-wo-wo-wo-wo

Black shades, bright nights
Back to back we'll do this 'til the end of time
You and I live, don't learn
Everyday we fight it out then let it burn

Just come into my arms
I will get you love drunk
We'll be burning ground
Us against the world tonight

They say you're a freak when we're having fun
Say you must be high when we're spreading love
But we're just living life and we never stop
We got the world
We got the wo-wo-wo-wo-wo

They say you're a freak when we're having fun
Say you must be high when we're spreading love
But we're just living life and we never stop
We got the world
We got the world
We got the world
