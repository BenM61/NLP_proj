The party is ending at 2 a.m.
So whatever you must do
Do it now!

Ching-ching, gettin' paid over here
Ching-ching, gettin' paid over here
(This is)
Thirsty, baby bring it over here
(A Missy Exclusive)
Thirsty, baby bring it over here

See my money maker, feel my money maker
(Crazy baby)
See my money maker, feel my money maker
(Serious man)

M-I-S-E, Missy be a freak
Sex so good I can freak you in my sleep
Ice on my sleeve I can make a room freeze
Pockets more bigger than a stripper booty cheeks

Dudes weak when they look at my physique
French on my feet cost a buck fifty
I don't swing from a pole, Missy swing from a tree
I'm Muhammad Ali 'cause I can sting like a bee

Whatchu know about that? So cute and fat
Let him hit it once and watch the dude come back
Cause the back so stacked it's like sittin' on a jack
Missy be the mack, that's a true fact

Ching-ching, gettin' paid over here
Ching-ching, gettin' paid over here
Thirsty, baby bring it over here
Thirsty, baby bring it over here
(Whatchu know about that?)

See my money maker, feel my money maker
See my money maker, feel my money maker

(I like this!)

Big things pop, little things stop
If you talk a lot in your mouth you get socked
Miss don't flop 'cause I only get the props
House on the water, Aston Martin in the lot

Look at my watch, cost a whole lot
So iced out you can't see it tick-tock
Yeah, I'm so hot and I can't be topped
Artists drop down like Michael Jackson socks

Got the game locked, make your body rock
If Missy ain't on it then ya song don't knock
You might get mopped like a floor so don't walk
You don't need to spit unless you live what you talk
(Let's go!)

Ching-ching, gettin' paid over here
Ching-ching, gettin' paid over here
Thirsty, baby bring it over here
Thirsty, baby bring it over here
(Whatchu know about that?)

See my money maker, feel my money maker
See my money maker, feel my money maker

Missy switch it up, do ya damn thang
Just like a chain, groupies wanna hang
Talk that slang, gon' head and let it bang
Make the hair stand like the hair on Don King

Boom, boom, shing, I shine like bling, bling
Call me a queen, mean chicks stay in ya lane
My flow so mean, if you know what I mean
So fresh and clean, you can call me Irish Spring

Whatchu know about that? Talk like ex-lax
If ya game wack then you ain't sayin' jack
Just like that, ya, ya, to get axed
Cause I got more hits than you can get out of a bat

Ching-ching, gettin' paid over here
Ching-ching, gettin' paid over here
(Crazy)
Thirsty, baby bring it over here
Thirsty, baby bring it over here
(New Missy baby)

See my money maker, feel my money maker
See my money maker, feel my money maker

This is serious man
Whatchu know about that?

Whatchu know about that?
Now whatchu know about that?
