When our kisses fly like oak leaves 
Caught in a gust of wind 
My heart beats fast, a clickty-clack 
Like a train goin' round a bend 

I call that lovin' up a storm! 
I said that's lovin up a storm! 
Well its good for you honey 
It won't do you no harm 

Ah when a we get with it darlin' 
All I can hear is a sigh 
Something touches you deep in your heart 
Like it's lightin' from the sky 

I call that lovin' up a storm! 
Whoaa Lovin Up a storm! 
Well its good for you baby 
It won't do you no harm 

When we're embracing darlin' 
I get wild as a hurricane 
Ah when we kiss Great Balls of Fire! 
Ice-water's running through my veins 

I call that lovin' up a storm! 
Ohhh lovin up a storm! 
Well its good for you baby 
It won't do you no harm 

Well its good for you baby 
It won't do you no harm 
Oh... It's good for you baby 
It won't do you no harm
