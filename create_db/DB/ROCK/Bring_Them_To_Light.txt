He's large and ugly giant monster, 
Headless on my back
This urgent haste in my head
Materialized in this dark hole world
No one can help me there
I know this pain has gone too far
The fear is now so loud

Kill a child I'm trying to protect myself
Against your old controlled hate
Pollution of mind filled all the space and destroyed my light
At least mine were never allowed

The hardest thing for me is
Facing the fear I live
No one can help me now it's under my heart

I'll come to know the living
My demons are inside
I'll bring them all to light

I wanted to hate, I wanted to die
I wanted to see you sacrificed
I had to deal with the fear you gave me
But you fucking never tried to help me
I was jealous and I was scared
Nobody ever replaced my pain
To say I'm not evil, to tell I'm not bad
Too late, I'm lost in human nature

Leave me be
Set me free
Leave me be
Set me free

The hardest thing for me is
Facing the fear I live
No one can help me now it's under my heart

I'll come to know the living
My demons are inside
I'll bring them all to light

Unexpected yet expected
Emerged from dark I come to life

You know me, you fear me
Always me knocking at your door, always around
Insulted, disrespected,
Return to the dark into this life

You know me, you fear me,
You know me, you fear me,
You know me, you fear me
You know me, you fear me 
You fear me
You fear me

The hardest thing for me is
Facing the fear I live
No one can help me now it's under my heart
I'll come to know the living
My demons are inside
I'll bring them all to light
