Over and over and over I try
To get you off my mind
But I can't win the fight
There's a feelin' I know
When I'm losing in love
It's the feelin' I get when I can't get enough
Something about you babe
Makes me feel the way I do
Know that I love you babe
So ya treat me like a fool
Wanna tell me babe
How I fit into your plan
Don't ya deceive me baby
I'm just trying to be your man 'cause
Oh nobody ever made me feel this way
And oh I think and dream about you everyday
And oh if I could only get you out of my mind
Oh but every time I try to run away
Over and over and over I try
To get you off my mind
But I can't win the fight
There's a feelin' I know
When I'm losing in love
It's the feelin' I get when I can't get enough
(Something about you baby)
Something about you baby
Changed the way I look at need
Is it obsession baby
Or just curiosity
Takin' advantage baby
Of my sensitivity
Do what you wanna babe
Just give back my sanity
Oh no other loves affected me before
Girl you change the rules but I come back for more
I'm a player in this game I'll never win
This addictive love's about to do me in
Over and over and over I try
To get you off my mind
But I can't win the fight
There's a feelin' I know
When I'm losing in love
It's the feelin' I get when I can't get enough
(Something about you baby)
Over and over and over I try
To get you off my mind
But I can't win the fight
There's something about you baby
When I think about you baby
There's no doubt about it baby
I know it's suicide to stay
But baby everytime I try to run away
Oh it's just something about you baby
Over and over and over I try
To get you off my mind
But I can't win the fight
There's a feelin' I know
When I'm losing in love
It's the feelin' I get when I can't get enough
Something about you babe
Something about you baby
Something about you babe
Something about you
Over and over and over I try
To get you off my mind
But I can't win the fight
There's a feelin' I know
When I'm losing in love
It's the feelin' I get when I can't get enough
