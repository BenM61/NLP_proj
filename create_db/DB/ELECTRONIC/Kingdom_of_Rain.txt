Tell me what you're thinking baby
Your heart's beating faster than mine
And I know something's going on in your life
Your life (your life)

You were the girl I wanted to cry with
You were the girl I wanted to die with

And you were the boy who turned into the man
Broke my heart and let go of my hand

Our bed is empty
The fire is out
And all the love we've got to give
Has all spurted out
There's no more blood
And no more pain
In our kingdom of rain

You think you know about life
You think you know about love
But when you put your hands inside me
It doesn't even feel like I'm being touched
And you were the boy I wanted to cry with
You were the boy I wanted to die with
You move further from my side, year by year
While still making love, dutifully sincere

But as silent as the car lights
That move across this room
As cold as our bodies
Silhouetted by the moon
And I would lie awake and wonder
"Is it just me? Or is this the way that love is supposed to be?"

Tell me what you told him baby
My heart's beating out of time with my mind
And I know something's going wrong in our lives

I just wanted somebody to caress
This damsel in distress
I just wanted somebody to undress
This damsel in distress
I just wanted somebody to bless
This damsel in distress
I just wanted somebody to possess
This young girl

Our bed is empty
The fire is out
And all the love we've got to give
Has all spurted out
There's no more blood
And no more pain
In our kingdom of rain
