Why you want to play around with my heart
You make me feel like you care
Why you want to play around with my heart
My love was there i thought that you cared

Until that day you turned and walked away
Your love was special to me
My heart has fallen apart and i know
That you're the one to blame
You said the love would never change
Then you go out and play

Why you want to play around with my heart
You make me feel like you care
Why you want to play around with my heart
My love was there i thought that you cared

I never knew that you could put me through
All the pain tha i feel, yeah
Saying sorry won't make it right
'Cause it will never be the same you're the one to blame
Tell me why

Tell me why you're living a lie
You never really loved me, baby
And now my heart is falling apart
You should have told me from the start
That you would break my heart, baby

Why you want to play around with my heart
You make me feel like you care
Why you want to play around with my heart
My love was there i thought that you cared
