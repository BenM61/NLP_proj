It's Christmas time
And its magic is here
It's Christmas time
And its wonders up here

The scent of time
Feels the Christmas seen in
While the church bell chimes
And there's joy everywhere

Some precious gifts
Like the little ones eyes
God' just bless it, lift
Sings the weary and wild

This Christmas time
Keep it's magic right here
Within your heart
Everyday of the year

Some precious gifts
Like the little ones eyes
God just bless it, lift
Sings the weary and wild

This Christmas time
Keep it's magic right here
Within your heart
Everyday of the yea
