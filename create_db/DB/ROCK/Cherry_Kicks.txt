Weve been apart for so long
I thought you were for ever gone
But now youve come back to me
I don't care about where youve been
I don't care about anything
My baby has come back to me
And it's just like cherry kicks 
Aaaahaaa
Just like cherry kicks
Aaaahaaa
Weve been apart for so long
Thought you were for ever gone
But now youve come back to me
Aaaaaaahaaaaaaa
Aaaaahaaaa
Its just like cherry kicks!
Aaaahaaa
Just like cherry kicks!
Aaaahaaa
Just like cherry kicks
Aaaahaaa
Just like cherry kicks
Aaaahaaa
Don't care about where youve been
I don't care about anything
My baby has come back to me
And it's just like cherry kicks
Aaaahaaa
Just like cherry kicks
Aaaahaaa
Just like cherry kicks
Aaaahaaa
Just like cherry kicks
Aaaahaaa
Aaaahaaa
Aaaahaaa
Aaaahaaa
