The other woman
The other woman

I turn away, know you're lying
Hear you call her name, find myself crying
It's so absurd, I tell myself
He hasn't changed
Always wants somebody else, another game
Always thinking of himself
Another day andother year another name

I'll be how the other woman is
I'll be just who I am
I'm composing, my goodbye love
Find myself, and losing no more time
Be how I know I can
I'm supposing, you know why love

They flatter you, you send flowers
Say you'll be right home, they you're gone, hours
It's so absurd, the same old song
Why should he change?
So secure, cause he has me to fall back on
Who's to blame the other woman
No he'll stay the same until he finds me gone

Will you send roses?

I have to say it feels so strange
So out of place
Insecure I see the flowers rearranged
How I changed, the other woman
And I'll stay the same, continue to be strong

So absurd I have to say
Your roses came today
(You) sing the same old song
You only want me now because I've gone

Yes I've gone
I've gone
I've gone
I've gone
I've gone
