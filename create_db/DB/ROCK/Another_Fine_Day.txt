To bad you got a chip on your shoulder
Your broken but hey
Its never too late
Try to run
Your just another year older
Still ready to fight
Look who's on your side

Woke up
Can't find your direction
Another fine day
Woke up
Can't find your direction
Another fine day

You put one foot in front of the other
And drift through the maze
Of golden haze
[unknown] birds darting out in anger
[unknown] out across the plains

Woke up
Can't find your direction
Another fine day
Woke up
Can't find your direction
Another fine day

Don't drowned your self in sorrow
You had a fall from grace

Another fine day
Another fine day
Another fine day
Another fine day

Woke up
Can't find your direction
Another fine day
Another fine day
