Rock a bye baby
You're the sweetest child
And when the wind blows
I will hold you tight
How can I talk to you about the shape of love
[Chorus]
You better watch out
There's bombers in the sky
Bombers in the sky
You better run for your life
Kiss your wife goodbye
Cause you know it's time to die
There are bombers in the sky
Ring a ring a roses
Floating on the sea
Sing your song for sixpence
But don't ask me to believe
No don't talk to me about the shape of love
[Chorus]
You better watch out
Cause there's bombers in the sky
Bombers in the sky
You better run for your life
Kiss your child goodbye
You know it's time to die
There are bombers in the sky
Dirty politicians
with Coca-Cola smiles
Tiny little babies
Are weaned on their lies
So don't talk to me about the shape of love
[Chorus]
You better watch out
There are bombers in the sky
Bombers in the sky
You better run for your life
Kiss your babe goodbye
Cause now you know it's time to die
Bombers in the sky
[Chorus]
