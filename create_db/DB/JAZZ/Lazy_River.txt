Up a lazy river by the old mill run
The lazy, lazy river in the noon day sun
Linger in the shade of a kind old tree
Throw away your troubles
Dream a dream with me

Up a lazy river where the robin's song
Awakes the bright new morning
Where we can move along
Blue skies up above, everyone's in love
Up a lazy river, how happy you could be
Up a lazy river-er with me

Up a lazy river by the old mill run
The lazy, lazy river in the noon day sun
Linger in the shade of a kind old tree
Throw away your troubles
Dream a dream with me

Up a lazy river where the robin's song
Awakes the bright new mornin' 
Where we can move along
Blue skies up above, everyone's in love
Up a lazy river, how happy you could be
Up a lazy river-er with me

Woh, up a lazy river by the o-old mill run
The lazy, lazy river in the non day sun
Linger in the shade of a kind old tree
Throw away your-our troubles
Dream a dream with me

Up a lazy river where the robin's song
Awakes the bright new morning
Where we can move along
Blue skies up above, everyone's in love
Up a lazy river, how happy you could be
Up a lazy river-er with me
Up a lazy river  with me
