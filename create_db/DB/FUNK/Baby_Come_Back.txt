I was a fool to let you go 
Let you walk right out my door 
It was a bad mistake I made
And i regret it to this day
If I had a second chance
Girl i promise I'd make it last
So tonight I erase my pride 
If you let me back inside

Baby come back 
Baby come back to me
I don't want to be free
Baby come back to me
Baby come back
Baby come back 
Baby come back to me
I don't want to be free
Baby come back to me
Baby come back

Over and over I try to forget you
But it seems too hard
My feelings for you I can't disregard
You're not my baby anymore baby
All I want is to bring your love back baby
It's not about sex baby
You're the best lady
Please have baby
Forever my lady

Baby come back 
Baby come back to me
I don't want to be free
Baby come back to me
Baby come back
Baby come back 
Baby come back to me
I don't want to be free
Baby come back to me
Baby come back

Baby come back 
Baby come back to me
I don't want to be free
Baby come back to me
Baby come back
Baby come back 
Baby come back to me
I don't want to be free
Baby come back to me
Baby come back
