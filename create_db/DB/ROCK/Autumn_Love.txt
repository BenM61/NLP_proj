No more lighthouses to deceive me
Just leave me floating on the open ocean
And let the moonlight take me anywhere on a tidal flow
And if I capsize it's alright
'Cause I've been feeling too invincible
I need to know depths deeper than the deepest of connections

Oh oh oh 
This autumn love 
Oh oh oh 
Is not enough

If there's no beacon tonight to guide me
I'll finally break the shackles of direction
And let the headlights lead me anywhere they wanna go
I feel at home now out on a bough
In the lattice of the backbone
Where the highways are holding in the pieces of our broken hearts

Oh oh oh 
This autumn love 
Oh oh oh 
Is not enough

Oh oh oh 
This autumn love 
Oh oh oh 
Is not enough

Oh oh oh 
This autumn love 
Oh oh oh 
Is not enough

Oh oh oh 
This autumn love 
Oh oh oh 
Is not enough
Is not enough
Is not enough
Is not enough
Is not enough
