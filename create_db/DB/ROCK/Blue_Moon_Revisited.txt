La, la, la
La, la, la
La, la, la

I only want to say
That if there is a way
I want my baby back with me
'Cause he's my true love my only one don't you see?

And on that fateful day
Perhaps in the new sun of May
My baby walks back into my arms
I'll keep him beside me forever from harm

You see I was afraid
To let my baby astray
I kept him too tightly by my side
And then one sad day he went away and he died

Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for

I only want to say
That if there is a way
I want my baby back with me
'Cause he's my true love my only one don't you see?
