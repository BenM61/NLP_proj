Pick and choose
The things you wear
Feel free to look around, with no obligation
Times have changed
So break new ground
Feel free and take your time take a little
Extra time, more time with no obligations

Clothes, in Vogue, are all the rage
But don't expect too much, they can't perform miracles
Head to toe
Disguised again, it's heavy when they say
We don't perform miracles, no we don't perform miracles

Ooh to be ah jetsetter
Be ah head start
Ooh to be ah, to be ah
Look at me, ooh in something new
Ooh to be ah

Cool glossy mags, reveal the facts
With a little bit of goo, it's usually in the who's who
Place your bets, predict the favourite party of the day
You'll find it in the who's who, who's there
You'll find them in the who's who

Ooh to be ah jetsetter
Be ah head start
Ooh to be ah, to be ah
Look at me, ooh in something new
Ooh to be ah
