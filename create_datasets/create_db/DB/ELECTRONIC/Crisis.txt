Crisis, crisis you can't get away
Crisis, crisis you can't get away
Crisis, crisis I need you on my side
'Cause there's a crisis
And you can't get away

Crisis, crisis you can't get away
Crisis, crisis you can't get away
Crisis, crisis, I need you on my side
'Cause there's a crisis
And you can't get away

Crisis, crisis you can't get away
Crisis, crisis you can't get away
Crisis, crisis I need you on my side
'Cause there's a crisis
And you can't get away

Make an appointment to the next dawn
Take a ? and saw
The watcher and the tower
Waiting hour by hour

There's a bridge in the security
A disturbance in tranquility
The watcher and the tower
Waiting hour by hour

The watcher and the tower
Waiting hour by hour
The watcher and the tower
Waiting hour by hour

The watcher and the tower
Waiting hour by hour
