Shut up
I'm so sick of them deadlines
I cannot stand why them maniacs are in them headlines
And even though I don't' know ya

Through my lyrics I'll show ya
The sanity's over
'Cause people say I'm bugged out
It's my business, stay the f*ck out

All I know is that the beat goes on and on (beat goes on)
And will be the same, 'til the day I'm gone

Nobody loves me, nobody cares
Nobody loves me, nobody owes me a thing
Nobody loves me, nobody cares
Nobody loves me, maybe I'll go eat worms

I'm so sick of the world now
It's all those people attacking my identity
Now the enemy's running at the mouth again
Saddle up when you step into the south, my friend

You're the big one, you're the good one
I'm the bad one, that's so sad son
'Cause I'm running no where
You see the black sheep everywhere

You need to drop that guard
Man, it ain't that hard

Nobody loves me, nobody cares
Nobody loves me, nobody owes me a thing
Nobody loves me, nobody cares
Nobody loves me, maybe I'll go eat worms

Now what's the matter with this
Someone's sure to find me
No exceptions for this (no exceptions)
So many time I fall through

No one has ever warned me
Life seems so meaningless
When ??? your inner strength
Ohh, I'm such a piece of shit

Oh, you're so perfect
Oh, you're so perfect

Oh, you're so much better than me
So much better than me
You suck!
Nobody loves me, nobody cares
Nobody loves me, maybe I'll go eat worms
