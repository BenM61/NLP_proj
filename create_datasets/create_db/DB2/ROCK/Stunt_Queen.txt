Oh, Kurosawa, let's be clear, I am not your mate
I did not come to kick it, I came here to collect
So tell me something other than the money's been spent
Better stop talking
Oh, Kurosawa, let's be clear, I know all the tricks
But I did not come to gas you through, I came to get rich
So, if you want to test me, you will pick up a stitch
Better stop talking

I've got friends in high places
I know what you don't know
Been round the block a while
In my time, I've pulled a stunt or two

Kurosawa, let's be clear, I am no local
See, I am not the one for your shenanigans
And if you want to try me, I will give you the most
Better stop talking

All these you think they've changed the game
Running round my ends in their SUVs
Talking grease out the side of they neck
No one likes a grass
I don't give a f*ck about Cindy Lou
If you get your mans, I'll get mine too
And I'll show you what this old-timer can do

I've got friends in high places
I know what you don't know
Been round the block a while
In my time, I've pulled a stunt or two

All these you think they've changed the game
Prancing round my ends in Huaraches and fades
A few more reps on chest day, son
If you wanna contend
See, I don't give a f*ck about the Old Bill
If you ring the filth, I'll bring my goons
I'll show you what this old-timer can do

I've got friends in high places
I know what you don't know
Been round the block a while
In my time, I've pulled a stunt or two
