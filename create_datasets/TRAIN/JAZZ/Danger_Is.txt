Comin' nearer, it's in the air
Gettin' clearer, it's everywhere
Hidden worries seem to grow
Uneasy feelings wherever I go
Danger is (3x)
Danger is (3x)
We're driftin' further from the things we love
Sendin' prayers to the heaven above, bove, bove
Shades of menace becomin' real
Troubles comin', I can feel
Danger is (3x)
Da Gefahr...
