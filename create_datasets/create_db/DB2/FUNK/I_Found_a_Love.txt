I found a love, I found a love
I found a love that I need, ohh, yeah
I found a kiss, I just want to tell you that I can't resist
I found a love that I need, ohh, yeah
And I wanna call her now

Wait a minute, there's one thing I wanna say right here
The way the woman walk, she set my little soul on fire
The way she talk, she my heart desire
And, oh, if you leave me, I figured I would die
If sometime I would call her in the midnight hour
Don't leave me baby
