Close your eyes and leave all your fears behind (it's alright)
Close your eyes and follow me until the end

So if you're hopeless
We can pick up the pieces
And if you're broken
I can carry the pain
Are you with me?
Watching the flames rise high (yeah)

Sing this with me
I break down the walls
I want it all
I won't stop until I burn this to the ground
Scream and shout
Till the lights go out
I won't stop until I burn this to the ground
We won't take this
You can't break us
We won't stop until the world is in our hands
I break down the walls
I want it all!
I won't stop until I burn this to the ground

Don't let go
We carry our torches high (always burning)
Come too far
To throw it all away
So are you with me?
Watching the flames rise high (yeah)

Sing this with me
I break down the walls
I want it all
I won't stop until I burn this to the ground
Scream and shout
Till the lights go out
I won't stop until I burn this to the ground
We won't take this
You can't break us
We won't stop until the world is in our hands
I break down the walls
I want it all
I won't stop until I burn this to the ground

I like the mess
I watch you fall to the ground
As the embers rise
And the smoke fills the air

I break down the walls
I want it all
I won't stop until I burn this to the ground
Scream and shout
Till the lights go out
I won't stop until I burn this to the ground
We won't take this
You won't break us
We won't stop until the world is in our hands
I break down the walls
I want it all
I won't stop until I burn this to the ground
