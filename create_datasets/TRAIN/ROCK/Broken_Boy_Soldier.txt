I'm pulling my questions from my shelf
I'm asking forgiveness
I'm asking about it by myself
And I want you to know this
And I want you to know this

You're rifling through a bunch of toys
That were handed down to me
Just take all the ones you want and then
Give the rest to my family

I'm going back to school today
But I'm dropping myself off
I'm throwing the childhood scenes away
I'm through ripping myself off
I'm done ripping myself off

Well I'm child and man and child again
The toy broken boy soldier

I'm child and man and child again
The boy never gets older
The boy never gets older
The boy never gets older
The boy never gets older
The boy never gets older
Never gets older

The boy broken toy soldier
The boy
The boy...
