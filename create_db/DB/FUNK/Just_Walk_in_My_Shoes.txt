Walk in my shoes
This hurt inside is too much for me
Just walk in my shoes
Youll see I want the love that used to be

Try on my heartache
Go ahead and try it on for size
Just walk in my shoes
Then youll see through someone elses eyes

What youve done to me
I fell apart when you walked out
(I just couldnt get myself together anymore)
(Cause I need, I need the love that we had) Oh, baby
(We had to fall)

Well, why dont you walk, walk, walk in my shoes (Walk in my shoes)
And youll wear a smile that isnt real
Just walk in my shoes
And youll know how broken up I feel

Try out each new day
Wear the cloak of loneliness I know
Just walk in my shoes
Or do you since you let me go

(Walk in my shoes) Keep on walking, walk on
(Walk in my shoes) Walk on

Darling, I fell apart
Baby, baby, baby, when you walked out
(I just couldnt get myself together anymore)
(Cause I need, I need the love that we had) Whoa, oh, baby
(We had to fall)

Well, why dont you walk, walk, walk in my shoes (Walk in my shoes)
And I pray that youll remember when
And if the shoe fits
Wont you say you want my love again

(Walk in my shoes) Keep on walking, walk on
(Walk in my shoes)
