Days like this are sweet
I'm talking in my sleep
I think you're goin soft
I know its stiff for me
And Saturdays are short
I'm walkin with my dog
A lie's a canyon size

Break up home there's nothing bound and left 
Longer that I love
Break up home there's nothing wrong with me 
I'm driving in the sun
It's a hell of a way down south
Bring me back my love

And in your home 
And Saturdays are short
I'm walking with my dog
A lie's a canyon size
Break up home there's nothing on the knife 
And days like this are sweet
I'm walking in my sleep
It's a place where I belong
I banged a million drums
Someday I'll go back home
You'll it up and go 
I like it in my head
And caught up in your love
