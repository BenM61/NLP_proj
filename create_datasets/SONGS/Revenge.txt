You keep looking at me while you dance in another's arms
And you pretend to be so enchanted with all his charms
Revenge, revenge, is that all you want?
Well, you've had your revenge; now come back to my arms

You keep telling your friends only heartaches I gave to you
And you hope in the end that my heart will be crying, too
Revenge, revenge, is that all you want?
Well, you've had your revenge; now come back to my arms

Maybe you want me to get down on my knees to you
Well, I'll do it gladly, darling, if that's what pleases you

Ya got to tell me now; you'll get all of a brand-new start
For you've had your delight with just tearing my heart apart
Revenge, revenge, is that all you want?
Well, you've had your revenge; now come on back to my arms

Revenge, revenge, is that all you want?
Well, you've had your revenge; now come back to my arms

I wait in revenge, revenge
Now is that all you want?
Now you've had your revenge; now come back to my arms

Revenge, that's all you want
Well, you've had your revenge
Come on to my arms
