Don't stop even for the right thing
Doesn't matter what I say?

My whole world was by that river
Flowin' north to meet the sea each day
I don't want to move away

You look at me and ya say "what's wrong boy?"
What else do you want me to say?

I don't want to leave tomorrow
I been and gone but I belong here now
Your big world can wait another day, ooh yeah

Brighter days where did they go, go, go, go, go, go
(Lord I'll never see) brighter days where did they go, ooh yeah
Brighter days where did they go, go, go, go, go, go
(Lord I'll never see) brighter days, yeah yeah

I am hopeful for where I'm goin'
But I belong in the South

That was where I was born a po' boy
Livin' life like there's no end in sight
Even so I've done without

Brighter days where did they go, go, go, go, go, go
(Lord I'll never see) brighter days where did they go
Brighter days where did they go, go, go, go, go, go
(Lord I'll never see) brighter days where did they go?

Brighter days where did they go, go, go, go, go, go
(Lord I'll never see) brighter days where did they go go, boy you about to hit the bottom
Brighter days where did they go, go, go, go, go, go (Lord me said have mercy)

And I see you 'bout to hit the bottom
