Oh, the black-eyed boys
They motor-cycled into town
The people cried, it's the black-eyed gang
All in white, a super bang
Oh, the black-eyed boys
They laid a rockin' rhythm down
You feel the time starts to come alive
Ev'rytime the black-eyed boys arrive

Well now the leader of the band, he was the drummer
He did a rhythm like a big tattoo
And you can see he put all his heart and soul in
The lead guitar, he's set astride and roared
And in behind there was a bass boy, too
They pretty soon had the hole town rock and rollin'
Ev'rybody

Oh, the black-eyed boys
They had 'em dancin' in the street
They rocked along from the mornin' light
On and on into the night
And oh, the black-eyed boys
They kept the people on their feet
Cryin' oh, let it never end
Wanna hear the black eyed-boys again

Oh, the black-eyed boys
Layin' down a rockin' noise
Oh, the heart right black-eyed boys

Oh, the black-eyed boys
They had 'em dancin' in the street
They rocked along from the mornin' light
On and on into the night
And oh, the black-eyed boys
They kept the people on their feet
Cryin' oh, let it never end
Wanna hear the black-eyed boys again

Oh, the black-eyed boys
Oh, the black-eyed boys
Rock and rollin' - rock and rollin' - rock and rollin'
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
