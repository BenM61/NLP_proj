I be the last nigga 
The quick to bust your ass niggas
Do anything in this world to get the cash niggas
I might even get mad and even slash niggas
Rob them and get away in a car and crash niggas
What!'s the world gonna do when I drop the smash nigga
Iron all in your face don't make me pull the trigga
Another reason for me to have to poor my own swigga
Thought I was posing for word up but a fed took my picture
Surgeon general I represent the underneath
The ask for shit beef
The worlds greatest fucking thief 
Brick layer hardcore smash your front teeth
Wilding it straight giving their mother mad grief
Rob a nigga strip him down leave him in his briefs
Do so much dirt the priest asked me to turn another leaf
Made the priest flip change his whole belief
Started wildin' in the club with them niggas starting beef
Act fool
