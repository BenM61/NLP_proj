So when the saints go marching in
They won't be singing for your sins
They just hope to Hell you've learned something
Living and breathing

Everybody dies with a debt
No silence, watching death is how we live
Take it or leave it
Don't waste your breath
I clear my mind, deny real life, define "here"
Without borders, possessions or enemies

Everybody dies with a debt
We all die for a life that we fear we will only forget
Or confess to a God that we know we only hear in ourselves

Bottle it up, let your problems distill
Forget your dreams or fulfill them
Leave no trace, waste away
It's time for change

So when the saints go marching in
They won't be singing for your sins
They just hope to Hell you've learned something
Living and breathing

Four walls in this prison
But I can still see the river
Four walls in this prison
Lies to poison your decisions in life, take note

(Now you tell me why you're living a lie)
Don't ignore it, now you know
I saved my soul
I sold it to the open road

I found hope in the wreckage of progress
Trophies shattered and stained
("Do what you're told")
There's a mold to be broken
A light burning over your name

(And I saved my soul)
But I never said I wasn't the culprit
Never said I wasn't deceived
(I saved my soul)
Just trying to rewrite the wrongs
That were written on me
(I saved my soul)

Everybody dies with a debt
We all die for a life that we fear we will only forget
(I saved my soul)
Or confess to a God that we know we only hear in ourselves

So when the saints go marching in
They won't be singing for your sins
They just hope to Hell you've learned something
Living and breathing
