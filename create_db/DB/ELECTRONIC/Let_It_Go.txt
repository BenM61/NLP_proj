Maybe I got a little something for you
Maybe you got something on me
Maybe I got a little something for you
It's doused in gasoline

Let it go down easy - let it
Let it go
Black river of lust and violence
Best not to think about that

My mind's dancing on diamonds
My heart and soul's collapsed
Can't think about nothing baby
Take it all by degrees

And I got this river rolling
Thing rolls right over me
Black river of lust and violence
Best not to think about that

My mind's dancing on diamonds
My heart and soul's collapsed
Can't think about nothing baby
Take it all by degrees

And I got this river rolling
Thing rolls right over me
