Small fry, sittin' by the pool room
Small fry, should be in the school room
My, my, put down that cigarette
You ain't a-grown up high and mighty yet

Small fry, dancin' for a penny
Small fry, countin' up how many
My, my, just listen here to me
You ain't the biggest catfish in the sea

You practice peckin' all day long to some old radio song
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes
You better listen to your Maw and someday practice the law
And then you'll be a real success

Small fry, you kissed the neighbor's daughter
Small fry, should stay in shallow water
Seems I should take you 'cross my knee
You ain't the biggest catfish in the sea

You've got your feet all soakin' wet
You'll be the death of me yet
Oh my, oh my, small fry
