I'm too foggy today
To know what you're sayin'
Your lips are moving so fast
And I just keep praying
For them to slow down
So I can make some sense
Of the words that are pouring out
Of your crooked spout

Last night was a record to be broken
It broke all over the kitchen floor
Oh no, don't you go
I'm coming back with a rag
To wipe away the haze from the days
We've forgotten all about

So be my somebody tonight
Be the one who'll hold me tight
Honey, please, please
'Cause I've been so all alone
And no one will pick up the phone
So honey, please stay

I held your head up, do you remember?
When you wanted to make a blanket outta me
Oh, and I can't lie, I been keeping score
And it's your turn to wring me out
And lay me down to dry

So be my somebody tonight
Be the one who'll hold me tight
Honey, please, please
'Cause I've been so all alone
And no one will pick up the phone
So honey, please stay
Honey, please stay
Honey, please stay
