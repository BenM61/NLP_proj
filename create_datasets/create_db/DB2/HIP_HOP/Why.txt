The whole song and the Journeys tough
Doesn't mean that I'm gonna give up 
I've given all that I had to you
Nothing left to loose
The whole song and the Journeys tough
Doesn't mean that I'm gonna give up 
This is all I ask from you

I wanna know why
Can you tell me why
Oh how far do I have to go
Before you put me in the know
I need to know why
Can you tell me why
Promise I'm gonna be working so hard
You stand there breaking my heart

Tell me how far
I don't understand, no

I wanna know why
Can you tell me why
Oh how far do I have to go
Before you put me in the know
I need to know why (The whole song and the Journeys tough)
Can you tell me why
(Doesn't mean that I'm gonna give up)Promise I'm gonna be working so hard
You stand there breaking my heart

Oh its been tough
I don't wanna let it go
And I'm not giving up on you
(You should know)

I wanted to be loved by you
Coz no matter how I try
I don't wanna let it go
Before you put me in the know

I need to know why
Can you tell me why
Promise I'm gonna be working so hard
You stand there breaking my heart
I need to know why (oh)
Can you tell me why (oh)
Why you not there with me
I wanna know why (oh)
Can you tell me why (oh)
Oh Why you not there with me
Why (oh) why (oh) why (oh)
Oh why you not there with me
Why (oh) why (oh)
Why (oh) you not there with me
