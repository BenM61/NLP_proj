Would you listen, would you listen
There's a baby crying down in Bethlehem
Would you listen, would you listen
To the voice of hope that's ringing through the land
People listen, listen
But still don't understand

Would you listen, would you listen
There's a great man preaching sending out His word
Would you listen, would you listen
To the truth He speaks and still He is not heard
Would you listen, would you listen
To a great man preaching turn your head around
People listen, listen
But still don't understand

[Chorus:]
But don't you know His love will shine down on you
Oh and yes His peace will come in and rescue
Don't you know His blood will cleanse you and save you
If you will open up your ears and open up
Your heart and listen

Would you listen, would you listen
There's a hammer ringing, ringing through the land
Would you listen, would you listen
To a cruel, cruel message
Crucify the man
People listen, listen
'Cause His blood is falling in the sand

When the baby cried we closed our ears to wisdom
When the word was preached we closed our minds to love
And when the hammer rang we closed our hearts to Jesus
Now will you listen, listen, listen

Open up your ears, open your heart
Open up your mind and open up your soul
Open up your heart, yeah, open up your heart and listen
