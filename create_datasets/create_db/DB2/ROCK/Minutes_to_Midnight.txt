Hah-hah-hah-hah-hah
Well you can write to me your truth and happenin's inside
Or sell me a world that I don't need, then hitch a ride
The driver laughs, we chase behind, tryin' to match his pace
You change our heads and you make our beds
It's a hopeless race

You're gettin' it all your way, you can't tell wrong from right
And right now you've got to pay
'Cause right now it's minutes to midnight

Well you can tell me all about politics and kings
Or the price of cars and whisky jars and a million other things
But it seems to me my friend, a lot of lines are left unsaid
When the speaker has the only key to get inside his head

You're gettin' it all your way, you can't tell wrong from right
But right now you've got to pay
'Cause right now, it's minutes to midnight, yeah, ah yeah

No use in getting uptight, no use in startin' a fight
It's up to you now to make it alright
Your clocks readin' minutes to midnight
You're speakin' too late

Take my money, spend my life and do my thinkin' for me
Negotiate and sell my time, till we come down from the tree
You just stand with a book in your hand, walkin' my high wire
And lead our way for all who pay, from fryin' pan to fire

You're gettin' it all you're way, you can't tell wrong from right
And right now you've got to pay
'Cause right now, it's minutes to midnight, yeah
It's gettin' too late

No use in gettin' uptight, no use in startin' a fight
It's up to you now to make it alright
Your clock's reading minutes to midnight

No use in gettin' uptight, no use in startin' a fight
