Kidnap me just for one night.
The earth will pass by if the ransom is right.
Don't worry I won't cause you any harm,
My only weapon is my charm.
Because I got no past I got no time to waste.
I am the goodness of your own good taste.
Hold me there, hold me so tight.
Kidnap me I won't put up a fight.
Because...

You and me, a love rendezvous somewhere in paradise.
You and me, a love rendezvous of lovers outta sight.

Patti sang horses, Stevie got uptight,
But I'm tellin' you everything is alright.
I'll make the drop I'll honour the deal.
We'll be love banditos, it'll feel so real.
You name the place, I'll make the time.
Just come along, it'll be so sublime.
I wanna feel good deep in your arms.
I wanna bathe in your own sweet charm.
Because...

You and me, a love rendezvous somewhere in paradise.
You and me, a love rendezvous. 2 hearts meet outta sight.
