Cast all your fears aside
And say you will, say you will be mine
And stay with me until the end of time
And help me, help me grind this mill of life
Please, say you will, say you will be mine 
And times and customs may change
And life may get dizzy
My heart is deep in the country
But I live for the city
Chasing those green fields
That lie just over the hill
Isn't it time that I rested
Time to stand still 

I need a lover surely as I need a friend
Someone whose laughter I'll lean on
To tie our lives together 

Cast all your fears aside
And say you will, say you will be mine
And love me, until the end of time
And help me, help me grind this mill of life
And say you will, say you will 

We're on a ship out to sea
And it's stormy weather
Why don't you promise to me
Devotion forever
The hillsides are yellow and green
And the olives still bloom
We will make passionate love
By electrical moons 

I need a lover surely as I need a friend
Someone whose laughter I'll lean on
To tie our lives together 

Cast all your fears aside
And say you will, say you will be mine
And stay with me until the end of time
And help me, help me grind this mill of life
And say you will, say you will 

Cast all your fears aside
Say you will
Cast all your fears aside
Say you will
You make my heart come alive
Say you will
Help me, help me, help me
Help me grind this mill
Grind this mill of life
Say you will
Say you will be mine
Say you will
Say you will be mine
