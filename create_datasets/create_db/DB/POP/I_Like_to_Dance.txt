Click clack shimmer 'n shine
Everybody's in a line now
Dressed up to the nines now baby

Silver, shiny, sexy, it's love and
The music's playing so loud
Disco balls and big crowds baby

Her eyes, they tell me what I need to know
Your touch tells me where I need to go
My lead will make you wanna get so close

Well I like to dance
So if you do just get on the floor
Forget the romance
This is what music was created for
So find someone hot
And if you're not it doesn't matter
Baby, take what you got
And just go dancing you'll feel better

I like to dance
I like to (dance, dance, dance, dance)

Lovesick electric sex thoughts
Are flying all around me
He said, she said "let's leave" baby

Fashion lives alive in her dress
And our eyes'll never leave her
The song creates a fever baby

Her eyes, they tell me what I need to know
Your touch tells me where I need to go
My lead will make you wanna get so close

Well I like to dance
So if you do just get on the floor
Forget the romance
This is what music was created for
So find someone hot
And if you're not it doesn't matter
Baby, take what you got
And just go dancing you'll feel better

Lovesick, lovesick, electric
