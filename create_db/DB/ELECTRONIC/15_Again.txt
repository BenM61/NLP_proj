Just keep it on the fast lane
Daddy ain't got time
Brothers in TV land
Life twenty years too far
We're all looking for something
Someone to care about
We're all working for nothing
Missing every sunrise
Lost sense of surprise
And sentimental walkabout
Takes all away from me
But leave me youth and extasy
Hook
Summer on the run
15 again
15 again
Lost sense of surprise
And sentimental walkabout
Takes all away from me
But leave me youth and extasy

Cold winters long gone man
No more space on my drive
I'm back in neverland woman
Innocense on my flag
Reminisence only give life to happy ends
Everyday I can be
Whoever I pretend
Lost sense of surprise
And sentimental walkabout
Takes all away from me
But leave me youth and extasy
Hook
Summer on the run
15 again
15 again
Lost sense of surprise
And sentimental walkabout
Takes all away from me
But leave me youth and extasy
