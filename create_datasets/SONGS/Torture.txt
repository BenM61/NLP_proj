Love me like you said you could
Love me 'til I'm numb
Love me like you said you could
Call me and I'll run

Right now. I want you
Right now. I want you

It's more than torture
When you're on your knees
It's more than torture
When you choose to tease

Love me like your favourite sweet
Your just desserts and more
Cover me in cheesecake mix
Swallow me up whole

Right now. I want you
Right now. I want you
