"Rated XXX" 

For the ladies one hundred and ninety five pounds of beef 
Chinky eyes curly hair and gold teeth 
Swingin' with this here stud you need practice 
I'm leaving floods of blood on your mattress 
I'll leave you holdin' your swollen backside and rollin' 
Fillin' all three holes just like bowlin' 
Don't ask me what the price is 
But it's more than your battery-operated devices, 
And I come fully equipped, 
With a temperature adjustment to heat up the tip, 
For demonstrations, watch me slam her, 
You'll notice the sound of steady poundin', 
Like a jackhammer once on it, ya can't cop out, 
I'm poundin' ya down until your eyeballs pop out, 
I'm not your ordinary player, 
Because you'll leave in a wheelchair, dear, after I lay ya, 
Get a grip on your headboard and hold on to it, 
Or get sent right through it, 
Bite your nipples when I lick 'em, 
Not gentle when I stick 'em, huh, 
I'll leave 'em lookin' like a rape victim, 
Any girl who steps to it, 
Ends up gettin' their stomach pumped like Rod Stewart, 
I do a damn good job, 
That's why 
Chicks are on my dick like a human shish kebab 

Only nineteen and over permitted, 
No matter how much young girls want to be with it, 
You ain't ready for the bed, 
You still got a pussy like Isaac Hayes' head, 
Come back in five years, 
When ya grow some hairs and when ya started drinkin' beers, 
I'm hittin' hookaz by the dozen, 
Makin' ya wetter 'cause I f*ck better than your husband, 
Givin' ya girl back spasms, 
'Cause G Rap has 'em orgasm after orgasm, 
Change the sheets? Ya must be kiddin', 
Ya gotta change the whole box spring, 
I ain't bullshittin', you get hit with hysteria, 
'Cause I'ma bury a big one inside your private area, 
All hell is in your tush, 
When cool G. Rap push pushes inside this bush, 
Anotha homegirl flinches, 
But I got inches for all you lil' wenches, 
The letter G is better when it comes to the letter X, 
An' I'ma talk like sex

Some say that I'm nasty plus, 
Hookaz are mad because they can't outlast me, 
Girl, you ain't too small, 
Cause I turn your crystal to one size fits all, 
So if you're still confused when I'm screwin', 
Let me explain to you exactly what I'm doin', 
Exploring your body like a biologist, 
Inventin' new ways just like a scientist, 
Taggin' my name on your buns just like a printist, 
While I'm hurtin' your ass just like a dentist, 
You're so wild I feel like I'm a zoologist, 
Stretchin' your shit more than a gynecologist, 
I'm gonna twist your ass to death, miss, 
And when you piss, you'll see more stars than an astrologist, 
G Rap is hot blooded, freakin' horny, 
Far from corny, come and jump on me, 
I'm not small and all, I won't break down a stall, 
I drive the ass up the wall, 
Nuts and everything are well in shape, 
The only thing missin' on my dick is a cape, 
Let's get togetha, honey, ya never know what's next, 
And I'ma talk like sex,

Big girls try to squash me, 
But I think with my dick, honey, so come and brainwash me, 
Hit the sack cause I ain't jokin', 
Cause when I start pumpin' shit up, I leave it smokin', 
So ya betta hold on tight all right, 
Cause my dick is a brown stick of dynamite, 
A stick, a trick, and it kills her, 
I'm probably related to Long Dong Silver, 
But it gets gooder and gooder, 
Every time I grab a hooka and I put her on my frankfurter, 
Kiss your breasts to your navel and then I skip, 
Cause the only thing I'm lickin' is your ass with a whip, 
And it's a real freaky scene, 
I'm hittin' girls with their heads in a guillotine, 
Why certainly I'm squirtin', 
Bust your nut and get up and wipe my dick on your curtain, 
Pushin' your head to the pillow, 
And givin' more pleasure than a double-headed dildo, 
A big ass gives me a hard-on, 
But I f*ck bitches with titties like Dolly Parton, 
Time or place doesn't matter to me, sweety, 
I'll f*ck you on the "A" train while I write graffiti, 
In a restaurant, takin' you straight to heaven, 
In a cab or the back of 7-11, 
Whether you're white and the music you like is rock, 
You can come and get some hip-hop cock, 
Consider this dick on your clitoris, 
But never try to flex, 'cause I'ma talk like sex.
