Everything I touch turns, inter-regular.
She's been speaking that way since the day I've dated her
Our species will believe anything,
Even Tabula Rasa, Could have become the king.
It's so easy to manipulate, take a seat I'll demonstrate
Now you've learned too listen, think, and respond
It only took a few, adults to wave from this one.
You're entitled to things that don't exist.

You won't be able to tell the difference between your stories and pornographic memories
I can't believe, I found dirty, pictures of you in the multiverse.

Everything in this world, is run by your computer
Everything in this world, is run by your computer

Ohhh
Yeah let's rock

Let it show, let it show

It's shutting down, it's shutting down
Are you ready to understand how
To feel alive again?
We're not who you think, you know(It's shutting down)
(It's shutting down)
Take a look before him (it's shutting down)
Nothing's real when you realize that

It's shutting down, it's shutting down
Are you ready to understand how
To feel alive again?
We're not who you think, you know(It's shutting down)
(It's shutting down)
Take a look before him (it's shutting down...)
Nothing's real when you realize that
