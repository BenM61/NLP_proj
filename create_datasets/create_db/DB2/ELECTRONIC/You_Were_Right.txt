And you
Were right to bide your time
And not buy into my misery
Well the good things are never free
Do the colours of the rainbow
Look the same to everyone

An' I
Was rushing round in circles
For a reason to believe
Wipe the slime from off your sleeve
You could follow me for weeks
And I'm not going anywhere

Sometimes it's hard to love someone
Until the day that they are gone

An' I
Just had a dream the other night
I was married to the queen
And Madonna lived next door
I think she took a shine to me
And the kids were all grown up
But I had to turn her down
'Cause I was still in love with you

I'm turning Madonna down
I'm calling it my best move
I'll get her tickets for what she needs

I
Remember doing nothing
On the night, Sinatra died
And the night, Jeff Buckley died
And the night, Kurt Cobain died
And the night, John Lennon died
I remember I stayed up
To watch the news with everyone

And that was a lot of nights
And that was a lot of lives
Who lost the tickets to what they need

An' I
Was busy finding answers while
You just got on with real life
Always hoped you'd be my wife
But I never found the time
For the question to arrive
I just disguised it in a song

And songs
Are never quite the answer
Just a soundtrack to a life
That is over all too soon
Helps to turn the days to night
While I was wrong and you were right

And this was a lesson learned
I'm happy to be your fool
And get your tickets to what you need

I'm turning the lights down low
I'm ready to make my move
I'll get you tickets to what you need
