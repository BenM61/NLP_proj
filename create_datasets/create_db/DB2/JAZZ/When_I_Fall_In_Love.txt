When I fall in love
It will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love

In a restless world
Like this is
Love is ended before it's begun
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

When I give my heart
It will be completely
Or I'll never give my heart

And the moment I can feel that
You feel that way too
Is when I'll fall in love
With you

And the moment I can feel that
You feel that way too
Is when I fall in love with you
