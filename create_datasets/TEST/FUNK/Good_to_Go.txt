I gotta thank the Lord above for giving me all your juicy love
And ain't no question when I mention love is strong
You smell like a Caribbean breeze 
So baby forever will you be down for whatever brings us pleasure every time 
'Cause I don't need no one else to bring me love
I want to have fun underneath the sun
So tell me one more time
That you will be mine 
Love needs love to grow 
So are you good to go?

Are you good to go?
Baby you made me
Are you good to go?
Baby don't fade me
Are you good to go?
Special is how we be 
Are you good to go?

I want you to marry me
I want to be first inside your love
So give me the reasons on the one
The reasons for why my love so special to your heart
So go on and tell me what you feel 
'Cause I gotta know girl what the deal is
Lovin' is special don't you settle on no one
'Cause girl you look so good like I knew you would
So if you want in baby let?s begin
I don't need no cure 
Girl I'll hold the door
'Cause I just need to know
Are you good to go?

Are you good to go?
Baby you made me
Are you good to go?
Baby don't fade me
Are you good to go?
Special is how we be 
Are you good to go?
Are ya good, are ya good baby? (Rep.)
