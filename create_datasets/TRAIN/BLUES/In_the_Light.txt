And if you feel that you can't go on 
And your will's sinkin' low 
Just believe and you can't go wrong 
In the light you will find the road (You will find the road) 

Hey, oh, did you ever believe that I could leave you 
Standing out in the cold 
Hey, babe, I know how it feels 'cause I have slipped through 
To the very depths of my soul, yeah 
Oh, baby, I just want to show you what I'd give you 
It is from every bend in the road 
Now listen to me 
Oh, whoa-whoa, as I was and really would be for you, too, honey 
As you would for me, oh, I would share your load 
Let me share your load, ooh, let me share, share your load 

And if you feel that you can't go on 
In the light you will find the road 

Hey, oh, though the winds of change may blow around you 
But that will always be so 
Wow-wow, wow-wow, when love is pain it can devour you 
If you are never alone 
I would share your load, I would share your load 
Baby, let me, oh, let me 

In the light 
Everybody needs the light 
In the light, in the light, in the light 

Light, light, light, in the light 
Light, light, light, in the light, oh, yeah 
Light, light, light, in the light
