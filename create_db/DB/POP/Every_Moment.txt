I remember riding in the back seat
Of my daddy's Chevrolet car
Mama's laughed, Daddy told stories
We never seamed to get far

I will always cherished
All those days gone by
I thank God for the good times
Every moment of my life

Everybody wants to be remembered
of something good, or kindness they shown
I want to help this world to find the answer
No one ever has to walk alone
When my time is over
I'll be satisfied
I thank God for the good times
Every moment of my life
Every day of my life

I don't wanna go back
And try to relive my life
I just want to say thank you
For all those good times of my life

I will always cherished
All those days gone by
I thank God for the good times
Every moment, every moment of my life
Every day of my life
Every day of my life
Every day of my life
