Stirring at water's edge
Cold froth on my twig
My mind in whirls
Wanders around desire

May I, can I, or have I too often craving miracles
May I, can I, or have I too often now craving miracles
Craving miracles

No one imagines
The light shock I need
And I'll never know
From whose hands deeply humbled
Dangerous gift
As such to mine come

May I, should I, or have I too often craving miracles
May I, can I, or have I too often craving miracles
Craving miracles

My romantic gene is dominant
And it hungers for union
Universal intimacy
All embracing

May I, should I, or have I too often craving miracles
May I, can I, or have I too often craving miracles
Craved

Waves irregularly striking
Wind stern in my face
Thunderstorm come
Scrape those barnacles
Off me

May I, may I or should I too often now crave miracles
May I or should I or have I too often

All my body parts are one
As lightning hits my spine
Sparkling
Prime runs through me
Revive my wish
I am inviolable

May I, can I or have I too often
May I, can I, should I or have I too often craving miracles
