In time baby, I'll get you off my mind
Little by little, watch my love slow down
But, oh yeah, you know what it means to be alone
Today you're laughing pretty baby, tomorrow you could be crying

You live for today, you leave tomorrow on it's own
We got a little child, we should try and make it a home
But, oh yeah, you know what it means to be alone
Today you're laughing pretty baby, tomorrow you could be crying

There's an old saying, every dog has it's day
The good dogs the one in the back fades away
But, oh yeah, you know what it means to be alone
Today you're laughing pretty baby, tomorrow you could be crying
