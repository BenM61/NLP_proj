There's a river in my mind and it won't stop running just for you
But there's a thousand forest fires between us and I can't get through
There's a race you got me running and I pray before the sun is down
I can't keep holding on

You know this love is taking over me
I tried so hard, I tried to breathe
I tried to carry on

Heartbreaker, I cannot be
It's so over, so sad indeed
Heartbreaker, so over

Now I know when hearts are broken
That with time they heal, so they say
But this heart of me I'm choking just to breathe
Another kiss, I pray

And there's a race you got me running
And I stumbled, I carry on I'm left my dive behind
You know this love has taken over me
I tried so hard, I tried to breathe
I tried to carry on

Heartbreaker, I cannot be
So over, so sad indeed

Sign on the dotted line if that is what is what it takes to set me free
And then I'll turn around and tear it up
If that is what I need to do, I will, oh yes I will
