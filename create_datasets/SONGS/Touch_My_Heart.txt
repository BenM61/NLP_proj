Touch my heart; feel the hurt, the pain, and misery
Then tell me again what love can do for me

If you lived in my world awhile
You'd soon forget how to smile
In my world there's a million ways to cry
If you had my eyes you could see
How woman changed my destiny
I'm a man who can't live and yet can't die

See these hands of mine and how they shake
All because I can't break
The habit of remembering yesterday
Another love couldn't help this ache
I know I'd make the same mistakes
Her memory's always standing in my way

Touch my heart; feel the hurt--it's destroying me
I've tried, but can't seem to shake her memory
Touch my heart; feel the hurt, the pain, and misery
Then tell me again what love can do for me
