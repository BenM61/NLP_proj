Some days are harder than others
Mountains we climb to get things done
Trying to make sense of the way I'm feeling
Looking for sanctuary, but finding none

You're in my head
You're in my heart
Too busy to stop
Too late to start
I don't want to hear you crying
But I have to say goodbye

Maybe you won't listen
But I really need you to
And maybe you don't hear
When I get to talk to you

I know that you need me
More than I need you
But don't ask
So much of me
It's what you always do

You're looking for water in a well you've run dry
You're looking for water in a well you've run dry

Some people are stronger than others
One smile can make some people cry
Hiding away won't make it easier
Taking your hand but I'm asking why

You're in my head
You're in my heart
Too busy to stop
Too late to start
I don't want to hear you crying
But I have to say goodbye

Maybe you won't listen
But I really need you to
And maybe you don't hear
When I get to talk to you

I know that you need me
More than I need you
But don't ask
So much of me
It's what you always do

You're looking for water in a well you've run dry
You're looking for water in a well you've run dry

Don't you ever listen?
I really need you to
You're in my head,
You're in my heart

Maybe you won't listen
When I really need you to
And maybe you don't hear
When I get to talk to you

I know that you need me
More than I need you
But don't ask
So much of me
It's what you always do

You're looking for water in a well you've run dry
You're looking for water in a well you've run dry
You're looking for water in a well you've run dry
You're looking for water in a well you've run dry
