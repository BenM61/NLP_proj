Ow yeah, yeah

In the beginning it was just like a dream,
I remember every word you whispered so sweet.
Your tender kisses and the love that we made,
Oh, you got me on my knees, I was never afraid.

You promised me the world,
Said I was your only girl.

(baby, baby)
I've been told a million lies,
I've been left alone with a broken heart,
But I still believe in love.
I've been hurt a thousand times, I've been crying all my tears in the dark,
But I still believe in love.

I believe in. love. ooh ooh ooh oh
I believe in. love. (in love, in love) ooh ooh ooh oh

I have been looking for somebody who's right,
Need a man who'll be there for more than one night.
I have been looking for the love of my life,
When you think you found someone,
You live on a lie.

Oh, you promised me the world (yes you did)
Said I was your only girl.

(baby, baby)
I've been told a million lies,
I've been left alone with a broken heart,
But I still believe in love.
I've been hurt a thousand times,
I've been crying all my tears in the dark,
But I still believe in love.

I believe in. love. ooh ooh ooh oh.
I believe in. love.(yes I do) ooh ooh ooh oh.

I've never lost my faith in love,
I've never lost my hope for a good life.
There's gotta be someone for me,
Somebody who can give me everything I need.

A million lies
With a broken heart, yeah

I believe in. love.(believe in love, believe in love, believe in love, I believe in love)
Ooh ooh ooh oh
I believe in. love.ooh ooh ooh oh.

Do you believe in love?
I still believe in love.
Mmm,
Do you, do you, do you, do you,
Do you believe in love, I still believe in love (believe in love)

Alright
