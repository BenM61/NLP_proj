I want my friends to think I'm awesome,
Awesome, Awesome Yeah!
I want this world to think I care,
I don't care at all!

For you I wear this mask,
At home I tear it off!
'Cause I don't need it,
I don't need it at all!

I'm a wannabe, I'm a wannabe angel!
I'm a wannabe, I'm a wannabe angel!

I want my fans to think I'm so punk rock
So punk rock and roll!
And all you hipsters say I'm gay,
Well I'm not gay at all!

For you I wear this mask,
At home I tear it off!
'Cause I don't need it,
No, I don't need it at all!

I'm a wannabe, I'm a wannabe angel!
I'm a wannabe, I'm a wannabe angel!

Do you want to be dead?
Do oh yes I am, yes I am!

You'll probably end up in Heaven,
And I'll be burning in Hell.
You'll probably end up in Heaven,
And I'll be burning in Hell.

I'm a wannabe, I'm a wannabe angel!
Come on, everybody, come on!
I'm a wannabe, I'm a wannabe angel!

Do you want to be dead?
Do oh yes I am, yes I am!

I'm a wannabe, I'm a wannabe angel!
I'm a wannabe, I'm a wannabe angel!
