Looks like I'll spend another night with the boys
I tried, I called on the phone, but you weren't home again
I guess that you've made some other plans
So I'll just get out the cards
And round up a couple of hands
Looks like I'll spend another night with the boys
I know you are out on the town
You're runnin' around again
And if they ask me, if somebody ask me why I'm not with you oh yeah
I guess I'll have to confess
That I've been wondering too
Why must I be denied the thrill of your kiss
What did I do to you to be treated like this
Why must I spend another night with the boys
Although their good company
I'd much rather be with you
Why can't you tell me, why can't you tell me baby what I've done wrong
And let me spend all my nights with you
Where I belong
