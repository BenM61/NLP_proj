Winding down from a busy week
Gonna tie down all those loose ends
Make sure everything is complete
Monday I just reminisce
Tuesday I long for his kiss
Wednesday I start counting down
Thursday no more friends around
This weekend
I'll be making love to my man
This weekend
I'll be making love to my man
I sure love that man
Love that man with all of my heart
Though my week is just beginning
I can't wait for the weekend to start
Monday I just reminisce
Tuesday I long for his kiss
Wednesday I start counting down
Thursday no more friends around
This weekend
I'll be making love to my man
This weekend
I'll be making love to my man
There's no one else in the whole wide world
Who gives me love like he does, forever I'm his girl
So warm and kind,
He satisfies my desire
That's why he's mine all mine
He lights my fire
And when the weekend comes
We're gonna have some fun
Now you can understand
Just why I make these plans
Not to have nobody else around
If it ain't my big poppa
I ain't down
Monday I just reminisce
Tuesday I long for his kiss
Wednesday I start counting down
Thursday no more friends around
This weekend
I'll be making love to my man
This weekend
I'll be making love to my man
