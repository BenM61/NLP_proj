What you got goin' on 
Behind those eyes closed, holdin' on 
I don't want another day to break 
Take our, steal our night away 
Warm shadow 
Warm shadow 
Won't you cast yourself on me 
What you got in store for me 
Keep those eyes closed, next to me 

I don't want another day to break 
Take our, steal our night away 
Warm shadow 
Warm shadow 
Won't you cast yourself on me 
Warm shadow 
Warm shadow 
Won't you cast yourself on me 

Won't you stop breakin' in 
Red sky, red light, awakenin' 
I don't want another day to break 
Take our, steal our night away 
Take our, steal our night away 
Take our, steal our night away 
Take our, steal our night away 
Take our, steal our night away
