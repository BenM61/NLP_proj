You're a hum hum hum hum hum humdinger
Want to cling cling cling cling clinga clinga
When we ling ling ling ling linger linger
Evert time we kiss goodnight
You're a hum hum hum hum hum humdinger
How my heart sings zing zing zinga zinga
How it ting ting ting ting tinga tinga
When you hug and squeeze me tight
I could call you sugar
Or even turtle dove
But that funny word humdinger
Seems to fit you like a glove
You're a hum hum hum hum humdinger
Gotta ring ring ring ring for your finger
Oh the bells will ring ring ring ring a ringa
Will you marry me tonight
The things you say
Are so inviting
Her lips on mine
Are so exciting
I never knew
What I've been missing
So stay right here
And keep on kissing
I could call you sugar
Or even turtle dove
But that funny word humdinger
Seems to fit you like a glove
You're a hum hum hum hum humdinger
Gotta ring ring ring ring for your finger
Oh the bells will ring ring ring ring a ringa
Will you marry me tonight
