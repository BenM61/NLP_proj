I take disasters in my stride
I dared upset me
Oooo Oooo Oooo
And those that need me on
Are sorry that they met me


But what will I do without you?
What will I, what will I
Do without you...
Ohh, but what will I do without you?
What will I, what will I
Do without you...do without you

If time and tide in life
perspires to defeat me
Oooo Oooo Oooo
I smile and carry on...
I will never let them beat me


But what will I do without you?
What will I, what will I
Do without you...
Ohh, but what will I do without you?
What will I, what will I
Do without you...do without you

And if my seven senses won, that one should leave me
Oooo Oooo Oooo
And smile in the darkness...
I would be alright, believe me


But what will I do without you?
What will I, what will I
Do without you...
Ohh, but what will I do without you?
What will I, what will I
Do without you...do without you

If that dark angle raises bony hands to clutch me
Oooo Oooo Oooo
I would not be a sting
If he decides to touch me


But what will I do without you?
What will I, what will I
Do without you...
Ohh, but what will I do without you?
What will I, what will I
Do without you...do without you
