The club is alive with the sound of music
Who's that girl in the spotlight oo coz she turns me on
Bring it back back baby baby like that

Came to the club not lookin' for love
Out with my boys just havin' some fun
Baby then I saw you
All of that disappeared

Standing by the bar just enjoying the view
Shorties all around but I'm focused on you
Bodies in the way but
I just wanna make it clear

You could be the DJ
I could be the dance floor
You could get up on me
(On me, On me)
You could be the DJ
I could be the dance floor
You could get up on me
(On me, On me)

The club is alive with the sound of music
Who's that girl in the spotlight oo coz she turns me on
1234
The club is alive with the sound of music
If it's you in the spotlight oo girl you turn me on

Bring it back back baby baby like that
Bring it back back baby baby like that

Girl when you move it's a private show
Got me wondering how low you can go
Girl you the fire come and put that heat on me

Don't tell your friends that you're leaving now
Just push your way out through the crowd
Meet me in the corner where nobody else can see

You could be the DJ
I could be the dancefloor
You could get up on me
(On me, On me)
You could be the DJ
I could be the dancefloor
You could get up on me
(On me, On me)

The club is alive with the sound of music
Who's that girl in the spotlight oo coz she turns me on
1234
The club is alive with the sound of music
If it's you in the spotlight oo girl you turn me on

Bring it back back baby baby like that
Bring it back back baby baby like that

You could be the DJ
I could be the dancefloor
You could get up on me
You could be the DJ
I could be the dancefloor
You could get up on me

The club is alive with the sound of music
Who's that girl in the spotlight oo coz she turns me on
1234
The club is alive with the sound of music
If it's you in the spotlight oo girl you turn me on

Bring it back back baby baby like that
Bring it back back baby baby like that
