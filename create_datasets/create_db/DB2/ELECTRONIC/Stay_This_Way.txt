Living with you in my life
Is like feeling the whole worlds on my side
Putting a smile in the place
Where a tear used to run down my face
Feeling the sun on my head
Where a cloud used to follow instead
Singing a song in my heart
In a place where all my troubles depart

If our dreams are falling down to the ground
Let them fly
Let the rain keep falling down
Cause baby I'm high
Now it will fly now that were together oh ho
Love is so high stay this way forever

I know that well stay together
Our love will be here forever
I hope that well stay together
