Slowly shifting, gently drifting 
In your arms, I'm quietly breathing 
Silent dreaming, thinking, yearning 
Hoping for a better journey 
Understanding what I'm planning 
You're so blind, you flounder drowning 

Moving closer, floating over 
Sinking into seas of color 
Feeling lighter, darker, brighter 
Consciousness begins to falter 
Holding you I start to wonder 
Pull you out or drag you under

Breathe deeper .... daydreamer
