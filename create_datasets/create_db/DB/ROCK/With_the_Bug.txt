Well down through the ages woman's had a time
Tryin' to get her man to walk the chalk line
To keep him on a string with a kiss and a hug
But there's never been a man who wasn't bitten by the bug

Yeah, rockin' and rollin' with the bug
Rollin' and strollin' with the bug
Itchin' and twitchin', singin' and swingin'
Yeah, with the bug

Well, Delilah loved Sammy, but he wouldn't stay home
Always runnin' and leavin' Dee home
She set out to find Sammy late one night
Found him down at the sand dune rockin' it right

He was rockin' and rollin' with the bug
Rollin' and strollin' with the bug
Itchin' and twitchin', singin' and swingin'
Yeah, with the bug

Well, Helen of Troy, a cool smile on her face
She sported the face that launched a thousand ships
But she couldn't control the wiggle in her hips
She lost her fame and fortune, just one flip

Well, rockin' and rollin' with the bug
Rollin' and strollin' with the bug
Itchin' and twitchin', singin' and swingin'
Yeah, with the bug

Well now Josephine, she had trouble from the start
She couldn't keep her eye on little Bonoparte
Every single time that Josie looked around
She found her Bony runnin' round and round

He was rockin' and rollin' with the bug
Rollin' and strollin' with the bug
Itchin' and twitchin', singin' and swingin'
Yeah, with the bug

Well now, are modern times the same as history?
Even in the twentieth century
And our future now, well, it's plain to see
If we don't look out, the bug will get you and me

We'll be rockin' and rollin' with the bug
Rollin' and strollin' with the bug
Itchin' and twitchin', singin' and swingin'
Yeah, with the bug
Yeah, with the bug

With the bug
With the bug
With the bug
With the bug
With the bug
