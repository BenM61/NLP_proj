Come to my aid you're sweet as everything
Come to my aid I'd give you anything
I feel so betrayed by the people I love
Come to my aid it's you I'm thinking of

Prouder than wild
Sad enough to sing
Come to my aid and care for social living

Why are we liable to die for survival?
Why is our nation divided?
Come to my aid...

In the poverty stakes see just what it means
When welfare decimates you'd better care
About your fellow people

Why are we liable to die for survival?
Why is our nation divided?
Come to my aid...

Come on board
