once upon a time not so long ago
this boy he took to the stage
he wandered around like a travelling show
but one thngfilled him with rage
while singing the song that thawed his heart
people would walk to the bar
the lights would go down
the music would start
he couldnt get very far

until one night...

CHORUS
kick off the beat and bring on the bass
everyone turn and look at my face 
'coz' all i want
is the best of order, baby
my life is up if your life is down
wouldn't you like to rock this town 
'coz' all i want
is the best of order, baby

now standing all alone
looking through the smoke
this kid he started to grin
he's tryin to compete
with bingo and jokes
there's no use tryin' to win

until one night...

kick on the beat and bring on the bass
everyone turn and look at my face 
'coz' all i want
is the best of order, baby
my life is up when your life is down
wouldn't you like to rock this town
'coz' all i want
is the best of order , baby

kick on the beat and bring on the bass
everyone turn and look at my face 
'coz' all i want
is the best of order, baby
my life is up when your life is down
wouldn't you like to rock this town
'coz' all i want
is the best of order , baby

you never even know what your missing
why doncha pay attention and listen?
someones tryin ta' blow your mind away!
why don't you turn around and I'm hoping 
two people in the front will start groping
someones tryin' ta' blow your mind away!

kick on the beat and bring on the bass
everyone turn and look at my face 
'coz' all i want
is the best of order, baby
my life is up when your life is down
wouldn't you like to rock this town
'coz' all i want
is the best of order , baby

kick on the beat and bring on the bass
everyone turn and look at my face 
'coz' all i want
is the best of order, baby
my life is up when your life is down
wouldn't you like to rock this town
'coz' all i want
is the best of order , baby

everyone turn and look at my face 
'coz' all i want
is the best of order, baby
my life is up when your life is down
wouldn't you like to rock this town
'coz' all i want
is the best of order , baby
