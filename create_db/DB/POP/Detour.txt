Detour, there's a muddy road ahead, detour
Paid no mind to what it said
Detour, oh these bitter things I find,
Should have read
That detour sign

Headed down life's crooked road, lots of things I never knowed
Because of me not knowin', I now pine
Trouble got in the trail, spent the next 5 years in jail
Should have read (should have read) that detour sign

Should have read
That detour sign

When I got right to the place where it said "About Face"
I thought that all my worries were behind
But the farther I go, more sorrow I know
Should have read (should have read)

When I got stuck in the mud all my hopes dropped with a thud
I guess that my heart strings are made of twine
Have no willpower to get from the hole that I'm in yet
