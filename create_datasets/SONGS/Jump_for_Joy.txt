I want to scream 
I want to jump for joy and I want everyone to know 
I want to scream 
I want to jump for joy, I gotta let the whole world know 

Jump for joy 
Jump for joy 
Jump for joy 
Jump for joy 

Everybody jump jump 
Jump for joy 
Everybody jump jump 
Everybody jump jump 

Jump for joy 
I want to jump for joy; J-O-Y 
'Cause Cupid shot your arrow in the sky 
You know the feeling, jumping and screaming 

Here comes the angels, marked by demons 
You must be dreaming, your heart is steaming 
Forget the pain and start believing 
Peace and love surrounding Earth 

Respect to my mum who gave me birth 
Butterfies are moving fast 
Is this the last love, the look of last 
Heavier as ever, rhymes are quite clever 

Respect to the world it's time for whatever 
Stimulate the feeling that you got inside 
Hold me down so we can take a ride 
Hoaw my month for you to enjoy 

Wave your hands in the air and jump for joy 

Jump for joy 
Jump for joy 
Jump for joy 
Jump for joy 
Jump for joy 

I want to jump for joy, jump for joy 
Everybody jump jump 
Everybody jump jump 
Jump for joy 

Everybody jump jump 
Jump for joy 
Jump for joy 
Jump for joy
