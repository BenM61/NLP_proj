Wonderin' who I would be
If you were sleeping next to me
Would this room feel alive?

Empty walls are closing in
Feel your breath dance on my skin
Shut the doors in my mind

You never know
What you might find
When you fly like life
Like life is blind

I don't know what tomorrow brings
But I'm not gonna wait and let it break me
All I know is that I can't breathe
So I'll go where the wind decides to take me

Wonderin' what I would say
If I permit myself to change
Let you live in my eyes

I'll do my best to not behave
Fearlessly I'll be afraid
Never walk a straight line

You never know
What you might find
When you fly like life
Like life is blind

I don't know what tomorrow brings
But I'm not gonna wait and let it break me
All I know is that I can't breathe
So I'll go where the wind decides to take me

I don't know what tomorrow brings
But I'm not gonna sleep and let it wake me
All I know is that I can see
So I'll go where the wind decides to take me

I don't know, I don't know
Just let go, let go

It's time to let it go, it's time to let it go
It's time to let go
It's time to let it go, it's time to let it go
It's time to let go

You never know
What you might find
Until you spread your wings
And fly

I don't know what tomorrow brings
But I'm not gonna wait and let it break me
All I know is that I can't breathe
So I'll go where the wind decides to take me

I don't know what tomorrow brings
But I'm not gonna sleep and let it wake me
All I know is that I can see
So I'll go where the wind decides to take me

I don't know, I don't know
Just let go
