Since you left, I've been holding onto a memory
Since you walked out that door, yeah
And you said I changed and you're so damn sick of me
You're not mine anymore, 2 3 4

Woah, woah
She said you need to let me go
Woah, woah
She said I'd die for you, you're like my drug but I can't get high off you
You're not mine anymore

Ayy, I still remember what you wore on the first night
Still remember how that black dress had your curves right
Still remember smokin' just to calm my nerves
'Til you had to leave and grabbed your purse, I grabbed first
Uh, it's no words, yeah, it's just her
Body against mine, makeup on my shirt
Lipstick on my neck, whiskey on my breath
Takin' pictures in the moment so we don't forget, yeah

Woah, woah
She said you need to let me go
Woah, woah
She said I'd die for you, you're like my drug but I can't get high off you
You're not mine anymore

And I can't be myself without you
I am not well
Okay, I said that before but
I need you now, yeah

Woah, woah
She said you need to let me go
Woah, woah
She said I'd die for you, you're like my drug but I can't get high off you
You're not mine anymore

Since you left, I've been holding onto a memory
Since you walked out that door
And you said I changed and you're so damn sick of me
You're not mine anymore

Woah, woah
She said you need to let me go
Woah, woah
She said I'd die for you, you're like my drug but I can't get high off you
You're not mine anymore
