My life is swinging
My life is endless
It is endlessly falling down from heaven
And you will be washed to my shore

So light, so bright
Your face is shining above me
Heavy rainfalls and fragile guidance inside me
Roses, oh I beg you to blind me with love

Come down, feed me with stars that you've stolen from heaven
Waste me, kill me with one single glance into my eyes
Roses, oh I beg you to blind me with love

My life is swinging
My life is endless
It is endlessly falling down from heaven
And you will be washed to my shore
Believe in goldmines
Believe in crying
Fear in your sweet hair reminds me of the silent days
I don't fear death
There's no place for me

Heal my soul
Be my raincoat, Roses

Although I'm swinging
My life is over
It is over
