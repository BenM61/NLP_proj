It's a beautiful mornin', ahhh
I think I'll go outside a while
An jus' smile

Just take in some clean fresh air, boy
Ain't no sense in stayin' inside
If the weather's fine an' you got the time
It's your chance to wake up and plan another brand new day
Either way
It's a beautiful mornin', ahhh
Each bird keeps singin' his own song

So long
I've got to be on my way, now
Ain't no fun just hangin' around
I've got to cover ground, you couldn't keep me down
It just ain't no good if the sun shines
When you're still inside
Shouldn't hide, still inside, shouldn't hide
Ahhhh... oh (Shouldn't hide) ah, ah, oh...

(Do, do, waaa)
(Do, do, waaa)

There will be children with robins and flowers
Sunshine caresses each new waking hour
Seems to me that the people keep seeing
More and more each day, gotta say, lead the way
It's OK, Wednesday, Thursday, it's OK
(Ahhh) Monday, Wednesday, Friday, weekday, ah, ah, ohhh

(Do, do, waaa)

Ah, ah, oh, oh (Do, do, Aaaa)
Wooo oh, oh, oh, Ah wo, do, waa
Ohhh... oh, oh, oh
