How does it feel in your eyes it's like I'm free
how can I need when I'm feeling incomplete
lost in your eyes, melt by a smile
it's when I wanna feel,
feels like hope to me, to me, to me..

In your lies I am caught
in your lies I am caught
in your lies I am caught
in your eyes I am caught

Just let it rain, the ..on me
take me away to a place I'm feeling free
lost in your eyes, melt by a smile
it's when I wanna feel, I wanna feel
feels like hope to me

In your lies I am caught
in your lies I am caught
in your lies I am caught
in your eyes I am caught
