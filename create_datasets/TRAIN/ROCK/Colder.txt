Come along with the whispering cold and fall
They left you nothing more to seek from here
So roll the feast in flames unforgettable
Take a bow to end, reload your remorse
Every line is thorn bite through your eyes

Still remains the everlasting hope for a bitter war
If it has made you colder turning your life for justice
They have learned to obey
Broken the rules I followed, burning for name so hollow
I will learn to obey

Among the weak and heartless I can breath the air veiled just like them

Still remains the everlasting hope for a bitter war
If it has made you colder turning your life for justice
They have learned to obey

If it has made you colder
They have learned to obey
Broken the rules I followed
I will learn to obey
