When you were mine, I loved you so much
I got a thrill from your every touch
You went away with somebody else
Now all I can say to comfort myself

Is that my girl has gone and said goodbye
Don't you cry, hold your head up high
Don't give up, give love one more try
There's a right girl for every guy

Although your love wasn't right for me
Good for another it will, maybe
Some girls were just made for some guys
Now I've got to make myself realize

That my girl has gone and said goodbye
But don't you cry, hold your head up high
Don't give up, give love one more try
There's a right girl for every guy

Now all I can say to comfort myself
Is that my girl has gone and said goodbye
Don't you cry, hold your head up high
Don't give up, give love one more try
There's a right girl for every guy
