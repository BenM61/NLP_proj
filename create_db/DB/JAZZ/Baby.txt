Baby runnin' everywhere,
Baby runnin' here & there,
Baby lookin' what we do,
Baby watchin' want to do it too.

Baby listenin' what we say,
Baby walkin', talkin' want to play,
Playin', growin', you an me to be,
Have you thought of what you're makin' baby up to be.

Mama treat your baby tenderly,
Papa bounce your baby on your knee,
Tell you baby stories, play your baby games,
Teach your baby, sharin' makin' love your aim.

What we gonna leave our babies when we leave this place,
How we gonna help our babies take our place,
'cause baby lookin' what we do,
Baby watchin' want to do it too.
