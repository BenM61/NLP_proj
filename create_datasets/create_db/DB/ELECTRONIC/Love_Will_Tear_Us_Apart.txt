When routine bites hard
and ambitions are low
And resentment rides high
But emotions won't grow
And we're changing our ways
taking different roads

And love
Love will tear us apart again
love
Love will tear us apart again

Why is the bedroom so cold
Turn away on your side
Is my timing that flawed
and respect run so dry
Yet there's still this appeal
That we've kept through all our lives

And love
Love will tear us apart again
And love
Love will tear us apart again

Resentment rides high
But emotions won't grow
And we're changing our ways
taking different roads

Do you cry out in your sleep
All my failings exposed
And there's a taste in my mouth
as desperation takes hold
Yet it's something so pure
I just can't function no more

And love
Love will tear us apart again
And love
Love will tear us apart again
Love
Love will tear us apart again
And love
Love will tear us apart again
