You've been lyin', been untrue
Now they call me Little Boy Blue
Someday, baby, you're gonna find
Nobody in the world's gonna give you lovin' as sweet as mine

You've been sneakin', doin' me dirt
Now they call me Little Boy Hurt
Someday, baby, you're gonna find
Nobody in the world's gonna give you lovin' as sweet as mine

Little Boy Blue, that's my name
Little Boy Sad, you're to blame

You've been cheatin', been untrue
Now they call me Little Boy Blue
Someday, baby, you're gonna find
Nobody in the world's gonna give you lovin' as sweet as mine

Nobody in the world's gonna give you lovin' as sweet as mine
