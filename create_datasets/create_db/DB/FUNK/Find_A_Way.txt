This ain't no game, no trophy win
No contest rules to box you in girl
You're more then that to me
You're the Michelle to my dreams

No rush, no stress, why worry fear
I'll chill won't push, no pressure here
There's nothing wrong with waiting
For something so amazing girl

I gotta find a way to win your
Find a way to win your
Find a way to win your heart
Find a way to win your
Find a way to win your
Find a way to win your trust
Find a way to win your
Find a way to win your
Find a way to win your love
No matter how long it takes
I gotta find a way

Your lips, your face, your feet, your hair
The way you speak intelligent
And baby girl I'm listening
You got my full attention

Your style, your grace, your elegance
You must have been made by his hands
A natural beauty
I'm hoping that you choose me

I gotta find a way to win your
Find a way to win your
Find a way to win your heart
Find a way to win your
Find a way to win your
Find a way to win your trust
Find a way to win your
Find a way to win your
Find a way to win your love

I know money can't buy you
So I would never try to buy my way into your heart
If you let me play my part
Love can be reborn

I know you've been torn and scorned
Baby it's been so long
Love has been so obsolete
Opposition made you weak
But I'm here, I'm here

I gotta find a way to win your
Find a way to win your
Find a way to win your heart
Find a way to win your
Find a way to win your
Find a way to win your trust
Find a way to win your
Find a way to win your
Find a way to win your love
No matter how long it takes
I gotta find a way
No matter how long it takes
I gotta find a way
