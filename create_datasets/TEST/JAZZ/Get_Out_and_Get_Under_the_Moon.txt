Whadda you do in the evening
When you don't know what to do?
Read a book?
Play a game?
Every night it's just the same!

Whadda you say if I tell you
How to keep from feeling blue?
My advice is good to take,
And it's easier to do!

When you're all alone, any old night,
And you're feeling mighty blue,
Pick up your hat,
Close up your flat,
Get out, get under the moon.

Underneath the bright silvery light,
You'll be feeling better soon!
Pick up your hat,
Close up your flat,
Get out, get under the moon.

Ba-da-da-da-da-da,
Look, look, look at those stars above,
Ah look, look, look at those sweeties love!
Oh boy, give me a night in June,
I mean it!

When you're all alone, any old night,
And you're feeling out of tune,
Pick up your hat,
Close up your flat,
Get out, get under the moon.

When you make a date, any old night,
You're gonna meet your sweetie soon?  (are yuh, huh?)
Well then pick up your hat,
Close up that flat,
Get out, get under the moon.

Underneath that bright silvery light,
You'll be feelin' better soon!
Pick up your hat,
Close up your flat,
Get out, get under the moon.

Ba-da-da-da-da-da,
Walk, walk, kiss me then
Walk again,
And talk, talk, kiss and then
Talk again,
Oh boy, sweethearts are all in tune,
I mean it!

When it's raining out,
Oh stay in your flat,
But on a lovely night in June,
Pick up your hat,
Close up your flat,
Get out, get under the moon.
