I used to sit right down and imagine
What it would be like
To have your loving arms around me
On a starry night

Oh but, I got tired of dreaming
'Cause dreaming is nothing to do
I got tired of dreaming
About you

My guns are loaded
You're in my sights
I'm gonna love you tonight

My guns are loaded
They're pointing at your heart
All I need is your loving
And a full time place in your heart

All I need is your loving
And a full time place in your heart

I used to sit right down and imagine
What it would be like
To have you lying there beside me
All through the night

Oh but, I got tired of dreaming
'Cause dreaming is nothing to do
And I got tired of dreaming
About you

My guns are loaded
You're in my sights
I'm gonna love you tonight

My guns are loaded
They're pointing at your heart
All I need is your loving
And a full time place in your heart

All I need is your loving
And a full time place in your heart

My guns are loaded
You're in my sights
I'm gonna love you tonight

My guns are loaded
They're pointing at your heart
All I need is your loving
And a full time place in your heart

All I need is your loving
And a full time place in your heart

My guns are loaded
You're in my sights
