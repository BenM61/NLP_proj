Comes the light
Comes the flame
Comes the child who is

Come the sword
Come the flame
Come the end of bliss's reign

Come the dawn
Come the day
Wake the softest soul up

Come the fire
Come the change
Lick the rose of Venus' shame

Come the night
Come the death
Down the path out of

Seven
Seven
Seven is my name
Seven come
And seven go
And seven
Still remain, yea

Seven
Seven
Seven is my name
Seven on the grandest scale
And seven
Still remain, yea, remain

And the light
And the flame
Take the path on

And the night
And the day
Fall upon the knees of

And the child
In the flames
Cast out of Eden

Seven
Seven
Seven is my name
Seven come
And seven go
And seven
Still remain, yea

Seven
Seven
Seven is my name
Seven on the grandest scale
And seven
Still remain, yea, yea

Seven on
Seven on
Seven on
Remain, yea
