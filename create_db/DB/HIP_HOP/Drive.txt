His feet are dirty
And his face, his face is long
And while he's peeking out
Through his hair he hides the pain
Till that Lennon song comes along
He'll turn it off and say can you drive?

Jimmy, we need to borrow this for a minute
'Cause we need to escape

Now there's so many things that
He's gonna do in 5 lifetimes
Hell I could do 'em all
Yeah and while he's rolling his own smokes
He says to me he's buying a new ride today
A classic deal the boss will give
He said the same thing two weeks ago

You've seen that sweaty jet rag
Feeling come over him, and I've
Seen that boy nod into a dream a time or two
And on his way out his glazed stare
Will make you stop and wonder
Hey William is that the last time
I'm gonna look at you?

But the next day phone will ring
And it will be him
Can you drive?
Jimmy, what would you say
what would you do
Oh should I pray?
Or do you think that this blind mind
Would listen to me, anyway
