Get it up
Get ready for a real good time
I'm gonna try to blow your mind
Can't you see?
You and me
It sounds so nasty
Get it up
Let your hair hang down
We could fool around
Don't you know?
I want you so
Make me happy

Get it up
There's nothin' wrong
We're freakin' all night long
Me and you
We need a groove
It feels good, do it
Get it up
Leave your cares behind
Let me try to find
Find the spot
That gets you hot
Let me do ya

What time is it?

Get it up, get it up, get it up, get it up
Get it up, get it up, get it up, get it up
Get it up, get it up, get it up, get it up
Get it up, get it up, get it up, get it up

Get it up
Get ready for a real good time
I'm gonna try to blow your mind
Can't you see?
You and me
It sounds so nasty
Get it up
Let your body drip
Let me take you on a trip
Can't you see?
You're killin' me
You're so freaky

Get it up
Get it up (uh huh)
Get it up (oh, oh, oh)
Get it up (oh, oh, oh)
Get it up (no)
Get it up

Oh

Get it up, get it up, get it up, get it up

Oh oh ohhhhh, ohhhhh
Oh oh ohhhhh, ohhhhh
Oh oh ohhhhh, ohhhhh
Oh oh ohhhhh, ohhhhh
Oh oh ohhhhh, ohhhhh
Oh oh ohhhhh, ohhhhh
Oh oh ohhhhh, ohhhhh
Oh oh ohhhhh, ohhhhh

Get it up! Get it up!
I'll work you all night
Get it up! Get it up!
I'll work you all night
Get it up! Get it up!
I'll work you all night
Get it up! Get it up!
I'll work you all night

Get it up! Get it up! All night!
Get it up! Get it up! All night!

You want it harder?
You know I love it nasty
