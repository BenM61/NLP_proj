Listen to me now my heart is screamin' out

And I deserve all you got babe

So if you're gonna hold me
Baby don't let go of me
Give me all you got I want everything

Misery loves a little company
Don't feed until them lies, Want you by my side
Why is it so hard to trust me?
Let go of your fears girl, promise I'll be here girl

Won't ever leave you lonely

Before I will do something
Seen a little sunshine seen a little rain
My heart's been through some pain
And I don't wanna go back to the little game
So I'm letting you know up-front
If you plan on being the one, listen to my instructions
Cause I'ma teach you how to (Love you like love you like)
Under the bills, brand new wheels (Love me like love me like)
Fresh new hair-cut baby I need you to (Love you like love you like)
New turn kicks bikes under risk (Love me like love me like)

Love me babe love me babe wherever you are
