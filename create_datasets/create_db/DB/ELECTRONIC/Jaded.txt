Your words give you away
Be careful how you say my name
Step back, refrain
Be honest when you save some face
'Cause you're fading
Don't mistake me for a fool
The game you play has changed

Take a look at yourself and the stories you tell
Does the truth weigh on your mind?
Tell me what did it cost when the moment was lost
Is this how you survive?

Why, oh why do you have to lie?
What are you afraid of?
We know what you're made of
Now your time has passed you by
You've already made it
There's no need to chase it
So get up, so get up and save it
'Cause enough is enough, you're jaded
Your golden years left you behind
You cannot replace them
Face it or you'll waste them
You cannot replace them
Face it or you'll waste them
You cannot replace them

The gospel that you preach
Is poisonous beyond belief
But still, you'll reach
Be careful of the truth
My speak is amazing
When it's there in black and white for all to see
We sow and you reap

So take a look at yourself and the stories you tell
Does the truth weigh on your mind?
Tell me what did it cost when the moment was lost
Is this how you survive?

Why, oh why do you have to lie?
What are you afraid of?
We know what you're made of
Now your time has passed you by
You've already made it
There's no need to chase it
So get up, so get up and save it
'Cause enough is enough, you're jaded
Your golden years left you behind
You cannot replace them
Face it or you'll waste them
You cannot replace them
Face it or you'll waste them
So get up, so get up and save it
'Cause enough is enough
You're jaded
Your golden years left you behind
You cannot replace them
Face it or you'll waste them
You cannot replace them
Face it or you'll waste them
You cannot replace them
