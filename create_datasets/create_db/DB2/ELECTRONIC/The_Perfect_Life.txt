Oh, we close our eyes
The perfect life
Life is all we need

You open up when you had me in your hands
Slipping far away, with the world at your command
You sing me to sleep, and they you hit me away
It's a perfect life, a perfect life

I only want to be here when you're by my side
Oh I believe now, I'll love you 'til I die
You will sing me to sleep, you will hit me awake
in the perfect life, the perfect life

Oh, we close our eyes
The perfect life
Life is all we need

Oh, we close our eyes
The perfect life
Life is all we need

Little mickey steps everywhere
Knives in his pockets and bullets in his hair,
He has nothing to live for, nothing else to say
He's locking out the doors
To keep the older wolves away

Spoons and foil are all he needs.
A bed and some china
A lighter and some speed
It will sing you to sleep, it will hit you awake
In the perfect life, a perfect life.

Oh, we close our eyes
The perfect life
Life is all we need

Oh, we close our eyes
The perfect life
Life is all we need

Oh, we close our eyes
The perfect life
Life is all we need

Oh, we close our eyes
The perfect life
Life is all we need

The perfect life
The perfect life
The perfect life
The perfect life
The perfect life
All we need
