If you wouldn't mind, I would like it blew
If you wouldn't mind, I would like to lose               
If you wouldn't care, I would like to leave 
If you wouldn't mind, I would like to breath

Is there another reason for your stain                    
Could you believe who we knew stress or strain     
Here is another word that rhymes with shame

You could do anything
