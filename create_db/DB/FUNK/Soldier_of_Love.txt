Lay down your arms of love 
And surrender to me
Lay down your arms of love
And love me peacefully, yeah

Use your arms for loving me
Baby that's the way it's got to be

There ain't no reason for you to be bad 
For you're the woman and I love you so

So forget the other boys, cause my love is real
Come off your battlefield

Lay down your arms of love
And love me peacefully
Lay down your arms of love 
And love me tenderly, yeah

Use your arms for hold me tight
Baby I don't want to fight no more 

The weapons you're using 
Are hurting me bad
And someday you're going to see
Cause my love for you baby
Is the truest you've ever had
A soldier of love is hard to be

Lay down your arms of love 
And love me peacefully
Lay down your arms of love 
And surrender to me, yeah

Use your arms for squeezing
And please the one that you want to hold
Soldier of love

Baby lay down your arms
Soldier of love
Baby lay down your arms
