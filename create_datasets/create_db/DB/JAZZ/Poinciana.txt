Poinciana, your branches speak to me of love
Pale moon is casting shadows from above
Poinciana, somehow I feel the jungle heat
Within me, there grows a rhythmic, savage beat

Love is everywhere, it's magic perfume fills the air
To and fro you sway, my heart's in time, I've learned to care

Poinciana, from now until the dawning day
Our love will live forever and a day, Poinciana
Poinciana, from now until the dawning day
Our love will live forever and a day

Blow tropic wind, sing a song through the tree
Tree sigh to me, soon my love I will see
Blow tropic wind, sing a song through the tree
Tree sigh to me, soon my love
