I want you to want me, 
For all that I am I,
Hope that you will try to understand
Do you feel the same?
Do you feel the same? 

(Do ya, do ya baby)

I want you to want me for all that I am
And i'll never leave you behind
I want you to be by my side you're always on my mind
Baby am I the only?

We've got to stop this game
Tell me do you feel the same?

I want you to want me, 
For all that I am I,
Hope that you will try to understand
Do you feel the same?
Do you feel the same?

Now take a good look what you see is for real
You know I've got nothing to hide
The way that I am is the way that I feel for you now
Baby am I the only?

We've got to stop this game
Tell me: do you feel the same??

I want you to want me, 
For all that I am I,
Hope that you will try to understand
Do you feel the same?
Do you feel the same?

Everybody knows that I need you
There ain't nothing in the world I wouldn't do
Please understand
This is what I am

I want you to want me, 
For all that I am I,
Hope that you will try to understand
Do you feel the same?
Do you feel the same?

Everybody knows that I need you
There ain't nothing in the world I wouldn't do 
Tell me now
Baby am I the only baby

I want you to want me, 
For all that I am I,
Hope that you will try to understand
Do you feel the same?
Do you feel the same?
