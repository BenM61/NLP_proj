Few drops left of my hope
I bleed in the name of faith
Decisions I've made, decisions of fools
Why am I bleeding for you

Missing the one who gave me nothing
The one who dreamed my dreams away

Why am I bleeding in my, bleeding on my soul
Why am I bleeding for you

Flaming pride in your eyes
Out of the ashes I'll build mine
Reason and feelings will never meet in me
Why am I bleeding for you

I couldn't live life like you could
I'm still the one misunderstood
I couldn't be the dream,
The lonely heart to seal your scheme
I couldn't live the life you love
