You've never come close to seeing what I've always had to face.
Image blatant and obvious
What's there more to assess?
Never looking beyond the frontal

All your present fears.
I hope to never be caught again by the visions too clear.
Erase it.
Deface it.
Conceal it.

Just take it for the face value
Concealment, nonetheless.
Just take it for the face value
You never know what you may get.
A wise man carried on about what you see is what you get.

I've peeled off covers,
Revealing what I want to forget.
Why not go base yourself on simple visages.
Scarring the complexion or scratching the surface.
