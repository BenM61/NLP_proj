I got a taste for waste and a taste and a blood
Murder I heard her when she screamed the "Drop!"
Cause her son caught the slug.
Relate this to no choice
And listen to this straight-up man before they ban the voice
While I ride to the rhythm of a pop
Remember the first nigga that run is the first to get shot
Whoever said that what I say and betray is negativity
Need to come kick it in the city with me
And find the black and crack and fact
And take that shit back cuz they don't wanna f*ck with that
There's too many niggas they're tryin' to calm
If motherfuckers could get it, nobody would've f*ck with it
Appetite for destruction,
For him to get a bit more shit he gotta commit,
Murder in the first degree, a man slaughter
Takin' the life of his wife and young daughter
A whole city of bitches they look sucked up
And the niggas is killin' it's straight fucked up
Whoever sayin' what I'm sayings for greed
Then I ain't even what they're tryin' to feed my appetite for destruction

You guys know who I'm talkin' to

That Appetite is tremendous
So I'm gonna spin this
Try for some violence because they ax me to end this
Some trouble that I caught cause I was noisy
A nigga tried to take advantage because I'm the kamikaze
He took de swing from my hand, thought I was faded
Start runnin' for the door but the fucker never made it
The sound of the 9 went bang!
And all over the wall was his motherfucking brain
Cause I'm a nigga you can't sleep on
So set the alarm, 'cause I hit like a motherfuckin' bomb
I do damage with a 9 in my hand
But the average nigga that don't know me don't understand
I'm from the streets so therefore
You know I don't care for
A sucker that ain't down with the real niggas the niggas the niggas yo
And that's the way this shit gotta go, and even so
But any time that the 9 wanna leave
I got a .38 hidden up the sleeve
And it's ready to go to war cause that's what it's here for
I shoot down a million niggas and shoot one more
And that's a million and one
That couldn't hang with the appetite
Cause they wasn't rappin' right
So I had to destroy whoever was standin' in my presence
For fuckin' up da essence appetite for destruction

"They put a hurtin' on your ass, man, you know, they realy degrade you,
White folks don't believe that shit, don't believe that cops degrade you,
Oh come on, those people, those people was resistin' arrest"

Check it out y'all, in the house y'all
So I can show and flow and let the people know
So won't you ease on down to the yellow brick road to Compton
But first let me tell you somethin',
I possess the 10 commandments of the Hip Hop Thugster,
Known as a thief and murderer
First one,
Alibi a nigga with an attitude
Gotta get respected, break your mothafuckin' neck
Second one,
Always gotta f*ck outta wedlock
I like it when the pussy goes snap crackle and pop
Number three,
I'm a gangsta fanatic
I smoke any fools tryin' to cause some static
Number four,
Here's what's in store
A crazy-ass nigga that remains hard core
Fifth one,
My killings just begun
I pulled out my gun, now they keep me on the run
Step six,
It's kinda tricky,
Can't forget that I'm mothafuckin' chickenshit
To the ones who tries to play the E,
By the time you reach Seven you'll be 6 feet deep
Number eight,
Make no mistake,
Move real sneaky and you're bound to catch yo' pray
Ninth one,
I gotta be raw, f*ck any brain-washing man made law
Last but not least, I must be real,
Number ten, is my appetite to kill
