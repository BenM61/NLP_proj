A long, long time ago I had a dream
Somehow things work out much different than they seem
All the things that I tried to find, givin' me no peace of mind
So now I leave it all as memories behind

My time come at last
My day is coming fast
My love is gonna last
When it comes, I feel a whole lot better

No love within your mind if nothing is said
No love within your heart if you don't really care
There's something deep inside
That you can never hide
And though you shine you'll find it can't be denied

Your time will come at last
Your day is coming fast
Your love is gonna last
When it comes, you'll feel a whole lot better

Just let yourself run free
Be what you wanna be
And when we finally meet
I know you're gonna see

Our time will come at last
Our day is coming fast
Our love is gonna last
And when it comes, we?ll feel a whole lot better

When it comes, now, when it comes
When it comes, now, now, when it comes
Now, when it comes, now, when it comes
Right, when it comes, now, when it comes
