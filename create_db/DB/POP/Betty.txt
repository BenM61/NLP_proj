You got a quick snap-lock on your cold, cold heart
You got your Y.S.L. kicks and a red birthmark
In the shape of Canada
That you try to keep a secret

You got a quick clack walk and a cold hard stare
And if your eyes could talk they'd say they just don't care
Before they wander off
To hide inside their sockets

You've got your scars and you've got your birthmarks
You've got Toronto hiding on your hip, honey
You've got your secrets
You've got your regrets
Darling, we all do

You got a fool-proof plan for a lonely life
You won't be no one's daughter and no drunk man's wife
If a wife at all
It's a silly institution
Or so you keep insisting

You've got your scars and you've got your birthmarks
You've got Toronto hiding on your hip, honey
You've got your secrets
You've got your regrets
Darling, we all do

You're cool coy, 'bout to stroll, very hip
It's you that's hidden by the expectations
We want to see you, won't you show us where to start?
You're talking trash with your red liquor lips
It's you that tickle in the conversation
Sweet Betty, won't you show us who you are?

You've got your scars and you've got your birthmarks
You've got Toronto hiding on your hip, honey
You've got your secrets
You've got your regrets
Darling, we all do

You've got a quick snap-lock on your cold, cold heart
