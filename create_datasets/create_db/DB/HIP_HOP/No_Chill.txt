No chill

I told Sonny warm the beat up, shit is freezin', he ain't got no chill
I ain't got none either, keep a flow right off the heater
To my team I'm Derek Jeter, I got hits, I'm in the field
With a halo on my deal, I signed to Hov, I'm lightskin Jesus
Hallelujah, hallelujah, you do you, more power to ya
I'mma test drive that xDrive, pussy wetter, just got baptized
I'm a franchise, you a fraction, niggas broke, can't pay attention
I got drive, she tryin' to screwdrive, guess I got to do it drill
Ay, we've been up since Friday, gettin' drunk and poppin' seal
Magic stick all on that ass, bitch, I'm David Copperfield
You a fan, don't it blow you that this shit just hot as hell
I'm with Skrillex and we chillin', but we still ain't got no chill

No chill, no chill, no chill, no chill, for real
No chill, no chill, no chill, no chill, for real
Hallelujah, hallelujah, I was born ready
But my shooters got shooters, they was born ready
Practice, what the f*ck is practice?
What the f*ck is practice?
Hallelujah, hallelujah, yeah
But my shooters got shooters, they was born ready

On the phone with 'Ye, he on the plane
He say, "What's up, nigga?"
I don't know, not these f*ck-niggas
Oh yeah, we was up, nigga
Got the new Beamer on razor blades
Stephen Curry on CP3
You fucked up, won't make the plays
F*ck with us, they make your grave
Niggas talk a lot of shit, but they don't say enough
Problems as deep as my pockets is, my Uzi weigh a ton
I'm a Hyde Park hooligan, you goofy, that's just where I'm from
Choppin' shit like the Karate Kid, not Will and Jada's son
I got SAVEMONEY, they with me now, so go and get you some
Plus my bands old enough, I could f*ck with my older sister's friend
Now my niggas try to clown me when I told 'em they was probably
Same niggas talkin' shit, lookin' shitty, get the bounty

No chill, no chill, no chill, no chill, for real
No chill, no chill, no chill, no chill, for real
Hallelujah, hallelujah, I was born ready
But my shooters got shooters, they was born ready
Practice, what the f*ck is practice?
What the f*ck is practice?
Hallelujah, hallelujah, yeah
But my shooters got shooters, they was born ready

No chill, no chill, no chill, no chill, for real
I was born ready (for real)
I was born ready
Don't you know that we for real?
Don't you know that we for real?
Nigga, for real
For real
Nigga, for real
For real
Nigga, for real
