The chimes of time ring out the news,
another day is through.
Someone slipped and fell, was that someone you?
You may have longed for added strength,
your courage to renew.
Do not be disheartened, for I have news for you:
It is no secret, what God can do.
What He's done for others, He'll do for you.
With arms wide open, He'll pardon you.
It is no secret, what God can do!
There is no night, for in His light, you'll never walk alone.
Always feel at home, where ever you may roam.
There is no power can conquer you, while God is on your
side.
Just take Him at his Promise. Don't run away and hide.
