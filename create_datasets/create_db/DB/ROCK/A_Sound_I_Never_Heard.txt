I'm kicking down the road
I got a top hat on
With my head in overload
I heard a radio song

There was something in the air
I think I know it well
Watchin' everybody stare
You know I never tell
You knocked me to the floor
With a sound I never heard (2x)

I was walking down the street
Saw you sneakin' out your house
Know who you're gonna meet
In the criminal hour

Saw you slip right through the door
You whispered just a word
Then you knocked me to the floor
With a sound I've never heard
