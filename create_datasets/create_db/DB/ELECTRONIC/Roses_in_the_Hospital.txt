Roses in the hospital,
Try to pull my fingernails out,
Roses in the hospital,
I want to cling to something soft,
Roses in the hospital,
Progressing like a constant war,
Roses in the hospital,
There's no one to feel ashamed for,

All we wanted was a home,
Now we are so strung out we wanna own,
Like a leaf in the autumn breeze,
Like a flood in January,
We don't want your fucking love,

Roses in the hospital,
Stub cigarettes out on my arm,
Roses in the hospital,
Want to feel something of value,
Roses in the hospital,
Nothing really makes me happy,
Roses in the hospital,
Heroin is just too trendy,

All we wanted was a home,
Now we are so strung out we wanna own,
Like a leaf in the autumn breeze,
Like a flood in January,
We don't want your fucking love,

Roses in the hospital,
This century achieved so much,
Roses in the hospital,
To make a voice no voice at all,
Roses in the hospital,
Flowers cannot express the loss,
Roses in the hospital,
Torn reflections of burnt out trash,
Of burnt out trash,

Forever ever delayed,
Forever ever delayed,
Forever,
Forever,

Forever ever delayed,
Indepencence is a game,
Forever ever delayed,
Credibility, I'm yawning,
Forever,
Forever,
(Rudi Rudi Rudi Rudi Rudi Rudi Rudi Rudi gonna fail)

Forever ever delayed,
Forever delayed,
Forever,
Forever,

Forever delayed,
The west scratches onto my skin,
Forever delayed,
Contagious like a sun tan,
We never felt any sun, any sun,
Rudi Rudi Rudi gonna fail,
