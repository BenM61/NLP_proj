If misery is your best friend
And has gotten so you can't pretend
Your tears, your tears keep givin' you away
But you're prayin' for, for a better day

Tell me why should I
Go through these changes?
But they don't dig the urgency
That this is an emergency

So make it heard, deliver the word, yeah
So make it heard, deliver the word, yeah
So make it heard, deliver the word, yeah, yeah
So make it heard, deliver the word

Tell me why should I
Tell me why, why should I
Go through these changes?
But they don't dig the urgency
That this is an emergency

So make it heard, deliver the word, yeah
So make it heard, deliver the word, yeah
So make it heard, deliver the word, yeah, yeah
So make it heard, deliver, deliver, deliver
Deliver the word, yeah

When that feelin' gets to you, yeah, yeah
And that feelin' you ain't had
In a long, long, long, long time, yeah, yeah
And it's good for your mind

It's like a baby with a brand new
New, new, new, new toy
It makes you scream, scream full of joy
It makes you say, la la, la
