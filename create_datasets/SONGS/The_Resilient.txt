An assembly of atoms so tight, spectrum of colors so bright 
We break the limits, we've felt the ground 
Now we touch the sky 
Unbreakable, an assembly of atoms so tight  
Unbreakable, trembling energy, with fire and light  

You may bend us, but will not break us 
Resistant, persistent 
You cannot end us, you will not take us
We are the resilient  

They try to break us down, but we stand strong 
We take the fall, we take the impact 
They'll never break us down, now we stand strong 
Absorb the force, we bounce right back 

War 

We were built for destruction, the facts don't lie
We were built for destruction 
Drop us from the highest heights just to watch us fall 
Climbing 'til the day we die 
If we fall down we bounce right back again 
We were built for destruction, the facts don't lie

We were built for destruction  

They try to break us down, but we stand strong 
We take the fall, we take the impact 
They'll never break us down, now we stand strong 
Absorb the force, we bounce right back  

We were built for destruction  

They try to break us down, but we stand strong 
They'll never break us down, now we stand strong  

They try to break us down, but we stand strong 
We take the fall, we take the impact 
They'll never break us down, now we stand strong 
Absorb the force, we bounce right back
