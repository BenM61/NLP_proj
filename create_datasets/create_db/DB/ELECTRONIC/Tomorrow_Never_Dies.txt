Darling I'm killed
I'm in a puddle on the floor
Waiting for you to return
Oh what a thrill
Fascinations galore
How you tease, how you leave me to burn

It's so deadly my dear
The power of having you near
Until that day
Until the world falls away
Until you say there'll be no more goodbyes
I see it in your eyes
Tomorrow never dies

Darlin' you've won
It's no fun
Martinis, girls, and guns
It's murder on our love affair
But you bet your life
Every night
While you're chasing the morning light
You're not the only spy out there

It's so deadly my dear
The power of wanting you near
Until that day
Until the world falls away
Until you say there'll be no more goodbyes
I see it in your eyes
Tomorrow never dies

Until that day
Until the world falls away
Until you say there'll be no nore goodbyes
I see it in your eyes

Until that day
Until that day
Until that day
