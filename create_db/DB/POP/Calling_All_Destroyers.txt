Walking wild at midnight 
Breathing like a panther 
Holding hands with my love 
Dancing like a master 
Calling all destroyers 
Calling all destroyers yeah 

Shadow beach Burgandy 
Get you high as lightning 
Driving in your Porsche coupe 
Don`t marry Fanny Frightning 

Mixing with the moon maids 
Melting down her rainbow 
King Kong, bang a gong 
All around your boudoir
