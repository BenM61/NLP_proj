If you wanted a star that shines so brightly
To match the stardust in your eyes
Darling, I would chase that bright star nightly
And try to steal it from the skies

'Cause I'd give sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey
Your perfect kiss thrills me so
Sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey
I'll never ever let you go

If you needed a dream to keep you smiling
I'd tell the sandman you were blue
And I'd ask him to keep that sand piling
Until your dreams would all come true

'Cause I'd give sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey
Your perfect kiss thrills me so
Sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey
I'll never ever let you go

If you wanted a love to last forever
Then I would send my love your way
And my love won't only last forever
But forever and a day

'Cause I'd give sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey
Your perfect kiss thrills me so
Sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey
I'll never ever let you go
