'Cause I want my ass...
Shit, one more time?

Well it's 2012, think we're going to hell (you must be upgraded)
Put me under your acid spell (you must be upgraded)
Because I want my mind to be completely toast (you must be upgraded)
When the tides destroy the whole West Coast (you must be upgraded)
Because I want my ass to be jumping, too (you must be upgraded)
Oh, my, my and a boo, hoo, hoo

(You must be upgraded, you must be upgraded)
(You must be upgraded, you must be upgraded)

So with the world ablaze, I'm in an acid haze (you must be upgraded)
And though the end is near, I have no fear (you must be upgraded)
So the deal for me is not the same (you must be upgraded)
I'm having fun, while you're having pain

2012, the morning to the New Year's light
Just save yourself, oh I'll meet you on the other side
Is this the ending, they could have called the fall of man?
Is this the ending, or are we gonna start again?
Are we gonna start again? Are we gonna start again?
Are we gonna start again? Are we gonna start again?
Are we gonna start again? Are we gonna start again?
Are we gonna start again? Are we gonna start

(You must be upgraded) Oh, my, my and a boo, hoo, hoo
(You must be upgraded) Oh, my, my and a boo, hoo, hoo
(You must be upgraded) Oh, my, my and a boo, hoo, hoo
(You must be upgraded)
