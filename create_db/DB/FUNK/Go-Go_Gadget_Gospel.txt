I'm well on my way 
I'm almost everything 
And this is my day 
Make me wanna sing 

I'm free, look at me 
And all and everything 
I'm allowed to see 
Free, come and see 
Na na na na na na na 

Shapeless, formless 
Heart is enormous 
I've born this, I've worn this 
No never what the norm is 
Come here this is fearless 
Contrast in color 
Wisdom's a woman 
Listen and love her 

Hook: 
I'm free, look at me 
Freedom in hi-fidelity 
Free, come and see 
Na na na na na na na 

What are you waiting on 
I want action, passion, smiling 
Laughing, yielding, feeling 
Helping, healing 
Introduce your neighbour 
To your savior 

I'm free, look at me 
Freedom in hi-fidelity 
Free 
Na na na na na na na
