I have walked
A thousand miles
I have worked
As fast as I can
And I have raised
A precious child
To be a man

But I would never
Turn my back
On your love

And I have gone
Up and down
Yeah I have wandered
From place to place
And I have raised my weary hand
To my face

But I would never
Turn my back
On your love

Is there anybody there who knows me?
Is there any body there who knows now?
That I will be home soon

And I would never
Turn my back
On your love

When the sun is going down
And there are colours
Against the sky
I have seen my home town
In your eyes

But I would never
Turn my back
Yeah I have learned
To face the fact
No I would never
Turn my back
On your love

Hey yeah yeah
Hey yeah yeah

I would never
Turn my back
On your love
