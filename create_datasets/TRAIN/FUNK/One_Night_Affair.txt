Oh I'll never let you under my skin
Baby, I just could not stand, um, hum
To be hurt again

Um, hum, ooh wee, baby, ooh, hoo, listen lady
He'll wine and dine you, take you anywhere you wanna go
Oh, but when the night is over
Hey, you just may not see me no more

All I want is a one night affair that won't hurt nobody
One night affair
Hey, I'll hit 'n' run, you son of a gun
But I'll hit 'n' run, but it could be fun, I said

I don't wanna love nobody
Don't wanna take me a while
Girl, you just may not be ready
To go steady for the rest of your life

So for that reason, a one night affair
It'll be alright, a one night affair, let's start tonight
Hit 'n' run, aha son of a gun
I gonna hit 'n' run, yes, I mean it, yes, I mean it

Cause you see I've been a lonely man
And I want you to understand
That I'll never let you under my skin
Cause I don't want to be hurt again

Oh no, baby
(Hit 'n' run)
Um, hum
(Son of a gun)

I couldn't stand it, baby
(Hit 'n' run)
No, no, no, no, now

A one night affair, sounds in a hurry
A one night affair but you don't have to worry
I'll hit and run, I'll be a son of a gun
And I know you have been lonely too

That's why you will understand
Why a broken heart is so harder to mend
But one of these day, I'll be alright
If you just let me love you tonight

And though it may sound a little temporary
Sometimes, baby, it's so necessary

A one night affair, I declare
One night affair
Hey, just hit 'n' run, I'll be a son of a gun
Said I'll hit 'n' run, yes I will, yes I will, baby

One night affair won't hurt nobody
A one night affair

Baby
(Hit 'n' run)
Won't you be mine
(Son of a gun)

For just a little while
(Hit 'n' run)
Hey, won't you be mine
Won't you hold me

One night affair
Oh, baby
