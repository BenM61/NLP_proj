She's flying in the face of fashion now
Seems to have a will of her own
She's flying in the face of fashion, yeah
Seems to have it all chromed
The time was going, so frequently 
She said if I try harder again
She's flying in the face of fashion now
Sells the world annually to a friend

She's singin' world shut your mouth, shut your mouth
Put your head back in the clouds and shut your mouth
World shut your mouth, shut your mouth
Put your head back in the clouds and shut your mouth

She always used to live so secretly
I'd be seen in the avenue sound
And taking on the role of the four winds now
Having tea there out in the crowd
She's flying in the face of fashion, yeah
Seems to have a will of her own
In lieu of what you're saying so frequently
She seems to have it all adds up

She's singin' world shut your mouth, shut your mouth
Put your head back in the clouds and shut your mouth
World shut your mouth, shut your mouth
Put your head back in the clouds and shut your mouth

World shut your mouth, shut your mouth
Put your head back in the clouds and shut your mouth
World shut your mouth, shut your mouth
Put your head back in the clouds and shut your mouth

World shut your mouth, shut your mouth
Put your head back in the clouds and shut your mouth
World shut your mouth, shut your mouth
Put your head back in the clouds and shut your mouth
World shut your mouth, shut your mouth
Put your head back in the clouds and shut your mouth
World shut your mouth, shut your mouth
Put your head back in the clouds and shut your mouth
