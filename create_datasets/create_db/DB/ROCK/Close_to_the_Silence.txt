Lately I've been so slow to answer
I've been choosing my words carefully
Give me some time and a clear head
And I'll tell you everything I've seen
I'll tell you everything

I've got a lifetime of things to say
So softly spoken from within
So listen, close to the silence
You will find peace again

Suddenly every thing's so far away
In my ear there's a whisper among the cries
So I try to see past the illusion
But the world gets into my eyes

I've got a lifetime of things to say
So softly spoken from within
So listen, close to the silence
There are voices on the wind
So listen close to the silence
You will find peace again

Then through the noise I heard you say
You'll find your way
So see me now a wandering child
Searching for peace 'cause

I've got a lifetime of things to say
So softly spoken from within
So listen, close to the silence
There are voices on the wind
So listen close to the silence
You will find peace again
