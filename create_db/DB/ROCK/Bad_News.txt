Baby, you ain't a man
Cause my heart's carried in your hand
Any fool can see
I love my misery
Bad news
It's born in my blood
Bad news

Some live to undo
Some live to be undone
My gray is growing dark
I feed on my own heart
Bad news
It's born in my blood
Bad news

Mama, tell me what is wrong
That every time I sing this song
You know I find you on my mind
Bad news

Whispers of what you've done
Crazy I bought a gun
My fingers to your window
Whiskey's on my clothes
I'm bad news
It's born in my blood
Bad news
Bad news
