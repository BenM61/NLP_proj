Many years has passed and a day 
Still we walk, in the path 
That leads, to the light 
Shining down, on this great beyond 

Thoughts ignite us, let love unite us 
Then turn your face to the wind 
And taste his love within 

You'll find a friend - everlasting love 
You can depend, everytime you smile 
You bless a child 
Our spirit perpetuates 
Our spirit meditates love and faith 

We must make our brother see 
That the light is he 
Shining on you and me 
And the land he gave 

Roads we must pave 
Looking through each others eyes 
Humanity will rise 
In love 

And our spirit will 
Be at one with thee
