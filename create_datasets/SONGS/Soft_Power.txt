Broken glass is luxury;
Friendly fires are alchemy;
Daylight is the enemy;
Witching hour, soft power

We're not sleeping at the wheel.
The wheel is turning the machine
That kills for us.

Close your eyes, so you're not seen
In Valentine's daydream.

We're not sleeping at the wheel
The wheel is turning the machine
That kills for us.

The hourglass of the forests
Setting fire to the tourists

We're not sleeping at the wheel
The wheel is turning the machine
That kills for us.

Broken glass is luxury;
Friendly fires are alchemy;
Daylight is the enemy;
Witching hour, soft power.
