A cigarette that bares a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
and still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumblin' words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you

You came, you saw, you conquered me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be

The winds of march that made my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer
Oh, how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things remind me of you

how strange, how sweet to find you still
these things are dear to me
they seem to bring you near to me
the sound of smoldering weaves the way to steamers
two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

Oh, how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things remind me of you
