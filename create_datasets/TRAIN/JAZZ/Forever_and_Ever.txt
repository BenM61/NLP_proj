Forever and ever
My heart will be true
Sweetheart, forever
I'll wait for you

We both made a promise
That we'd never part
Let's seal it with a kiss
Forever my Sweetheart

Let bygones be bygones forever
We'll fall in love once again
So, let's tell the world of our new love divine
Forever and ever you'll be mine
