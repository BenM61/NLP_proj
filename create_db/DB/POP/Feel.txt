What you want, what you got 
Live your life in a crawl space
I'll help you out but you don't want a chance at a better life
You said you never took a ride and now you wanna play
Well, it's a big, big city let me show you around some time
Oh, some time

And now you crossed that line
You can't come back
Tell me how does it feel now
It's too late too much to forget about
Can't stop now
How does it feel now
I'm only asking because I wanna know
How...you...wanna...feel

Well, I'm a wreck
I'm a mess
I'm a spot on the pavement
I'm a number on your wall
I make you so tired
And I don't think I like this game no more
It goes around and round and round 
I'll tell you one more time
Yeah, one more time

And now you crossed that line
You can't come back
Tell me how does it feel now
It's too late too much to forget about
Can't stop now
How does it feel now
I'm only asking because I wanna know
How...you...wanna...feel

How you wanna feel

And now you crossed that line
You can't come back
Tell me how does it feel now
It's too late too much to forget about
Can't stop now
How does it feel now
I'm only asking because I wanna know
How...you...wanna...feel

How...you...wanna...feel
How...you...wanna...feel
