How can I 
Believe that my 
Heart would find 
Someone like you 
You see 
The real me 
No in between's 
I had no where to hide 
You took away the walls around me 
Made me feel safe to share my truth 

I see the heaven's open 
A heart that once was broken 
Is holding nothing back 
Now that I found you 
You hold me like a prayer 
You touch me everywhere 
A life time just ain't enough to love you true 
Now that I found you 
Now that I found you 

You believe 
Were meant to be 
Our chemistry 
We'll last forever 
And throught the years 
We've seen some tears 
We'll conquer fears 
Together we will grow old 
When I'm lookin in your eyes they tell me 
I'll no longer have to feel alone 

I see the heaven's open 
A heart that once was broken 
Is holding nothing back 
Now that I found you 
You hold me like a prayer 
You touch me everywhere 
A life time just ain't enough to love you true 
Now that I found you 
Now that I found you 

You you see me 
The real me 
You believe in me 

I see the heaven's open 
A heart that once was broken 
Is holding nothing back 
Now that I found you 
You hold me like a prayer 
You touch me everywhere 
A life time just ain't enough 

I see the heaven's open 
A heart that once was broken 
Is holding nothing back 
Now that I found you 
You hold me like a prayer 
You touch me everywhere 
A life time just ain't enough to love you true 
Now that I found you 
Now that I found you
