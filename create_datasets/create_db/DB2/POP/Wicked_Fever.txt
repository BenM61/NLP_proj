Wicked fever
Fire love into my arms
Running deeper 
oh my fear wont touch the ground

Looking for reasons underneath my bed
And I will follow you and I will follow

hey my shivering mind, feed me til I wake up
And oh my shimmering sun coming in the air tonight
I go broader, I swam in the light
So high on my night
it's coming in the air tonight
it's coming in the air tonight
it's coming in the air tonight

Wait to find out
the feelings rising in my veins
wicked fever
got me burning til the end

Looking for reasons underneath my bed
And I will follow you and I will follow

hey my shivering mind, feed me til I wake up
And oh my shimmering sun coming in the air tonight
I go broader, I swam in the light
So high on my night
it's coming in the air tonight
it's coming in the air tonight
it's coming in the air tonight

Looking for reasons underneath my bed
And I will follow you and I will follow

hey my shivering mind, feed me til I wake up
And oh my shimmering sun coming in the air tonight
I go broader, I swam in the light
So high on my night
it's coming in the air tonight
it's coming in the air tonight
it's coming in the air tonight
