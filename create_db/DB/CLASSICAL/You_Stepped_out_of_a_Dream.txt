You stepped out of a dream
You are too wonderful to be what you seem!
Could there be eyes like yours, could there be lips like yours
Could there be smiles like yours, honest and truly?
You stepped out of a cloud
I want to take you away, away from the crowd
And have you all to myself, alone and apart out of a dream, safe in my heart
