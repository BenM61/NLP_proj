I don't know what I'll do to you
I find myself at the East river 
Waiting to meet with you
And late at night 
I keep dreaming of you
We're makin' love on the sofa
That belongs to you
We fly higher than kites
When we're face to face
Searching for time alone
In this here vital place
And we don't know who we are 
Or why we met
But it's strangely good
In some sort of freakish way

The things we'll do will make you feel like a woman
Falling in love with a man she doesn't even know
The words we'll say will send your mind on a journey
Looking for self understanding of the things we've done

Catch your breath
Your heart beats too fast
You feel my presence in your arms will not last
Although, I have an urge
I must kiss your hand
The fresh sent of this woman's fragrance 
Lays deep in my hand
So we slit our wrists
And we join our blood
To symbolize some type of crazy oath
Sometimes it feels so wrong 
But it could be good enough
To sacrifice our freedom
For each other's hearts

The things we'll do will make you feel like a woman
Falling in love with a man she doesn't even know
The words we'll say will send your mind on a journey
Looking for self understanding of the things we've done

Like a woman
Falling in love with a man she doesn't even know
Who
Come along

I said the things we do will make you feel like a woman
Falling in love with a man she doesn't even know
The words we'll say will send your mind on a journey
Looking for self understanding of the things we've done
The things that we do will make you feel like a woman
Falling in love with a man she doesn't even know
(She don't even know that man but she falls in love)
The words we'll say will send your mind on a journey
('Cause she loves him)
Looking for self understanding of the things we've done
(But she don't even know his name)
