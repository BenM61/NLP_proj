No one is restricted, no one is tied down
But the Greece of old collapsed 'cause
No one liked their girls
We won't have that problem, I'm doing my part
No one asked me but I'll still answer la-la-la-la-la-la

I like girls, I like girls
I like girls, I like girls

I sweat in the daytime, I don't sweat much at night
No one asked me but I still answer "I like girls, I like girls"
All those who are with me, let's all raise our hands high
When they ask you, you'll surely answer la-la-la-la-la-la
I like girls, I like girls
I like girls, I like girls

Day of wedding preparation, you must decide
Has your choice been made?

Yes, I like girls
I like girls
