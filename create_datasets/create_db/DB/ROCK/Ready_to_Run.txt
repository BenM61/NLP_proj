When the train rolls by
I'm gonna be ready this time
When the boy gets that look in his eye
I'm gonna be ready this time
When my momma says I look good in white
I'm gonna be ready this time

Oh yeah
Ready, ready, ready, ready, ready to run
All I'm ready to do is have some fun
What's all this talk about love

I feel the wind blow through my hair
I'm gonna be ready this time
I'll buy a ticket to anywhere
I'm gonna be ready this time
You see it feels like I'm starting to care
And I'm going to be ready this time

Oh yeah
Ready, ready, ready, ready, ready to run
All I'm ready to do is have some fun
What's all this talk about love

I'm ready to run
I'm ready to run

Oh
Ready, ready, ready, ready, ready to run
All I'm ready to do is have some fun
What's all this talk about love
I'm ready to run
I'm ready to run
I'm ready to run
I'm ready to run, ready to run,
Ready to run, yeah I'm ready to run, I'm ready
Whoa I'm ready to run, I'm ready, ready to run
(I'm ready) I'm ready to run
I'm ready
