I look into your eyes and fall away 
You make me feel I don't exist 
Time can make a better place for us 
But you make me feel lonely when I'm not 

I can not help the way I feel for you 
As I fall into your arms 
I can be someone who needs you 
How i tried... How i tried... 

I can not help the way I feel for you 
As I fall into your arms 
I can be someone who needs you 
How i tried... How i tried... 

I can not help the way I feel for you 
As I fall into your arms 
I can be someone who needs you 
How i tried... How i tried...
