Oh
Hey hey
Hey
La la la
He, friend for all my life
I would not deny
Like brothers in my mind. She, treasure of his heart
There upon his arm
Eyes of midnight stars
I've been tempted by forbidden love before
But why must she be everythin
That I've been praying for
Now this burning in my heart will I ignore
When I know that she'll be knocking at my door

Hey
Why you messing with my feelings
Why you follow me
I can read the signs you're giving
Why you follow me
Turn away from your desire
Why you follow me

Don't be playing with this fire
Why you follow me
Now she's dancing in the night
Her body is the moonlight
Too much for me to fight
Now I'm lost within her arms

Careless with my heart
I'm weakened by her charms
He has looked me in my eyes a million times
But now I turn away for I'm afraid
Of what he'll find
She's the precious love
for whom his heart beats for
But now she's always knocking at my door

Hey
Why you messing with my feelings
Why you follow me
I can read the signs you're giving
Why you follow me
Turn away from your desire
Why you follow me
