I got home late on a Saturday night
And I knew right away something wasn't right
I knew she was gone

She took all I had but, left a hole in my heart
Should've known it would go bad, right from the start
What did I do wrong?

I can't understand why she would leave me this way
With nothing to say
Then I found the note on the door
It said good-bye and she don't want me no more

[Chorus]
"Bye bye baby, bye bye....", She said in her letter
And that was all she wrote
Guess this is goodbye, guess this is forever
And that was all she wrote

I called on the phone, but she wasn't there
Should've know all along that she just didn't care
Why did she have to go?

Now I look at her picture and I wonder why
She left me this way...-Why did she say goodbye?
I guess I'll never know

I can't understand why she would leave me this way
With nothing to say
I remember the note on the door
It said good-bye and she don't want me no more

[Chorus]
