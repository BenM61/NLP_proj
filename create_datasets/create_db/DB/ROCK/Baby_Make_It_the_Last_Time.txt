Baby make it the last time, don't walk out on me.
Baby make it the last time, you let me down, you know I need you.

Each time you go, and leave me here cryin', 
You walk on my dreams and time owes me dyin'.
Baby make it the last time, don't walk out on me.
Baby make it the last time, you let me down, you know I need you.

What would I be, in a world without you close to me.
I couldn't go on, you're still so much a part of me
Baby make it the last time, don't walk out on me.
Baby make it the last time, you let me down, you know I need you.

Tomorrow is another day, I'll be a new man.
I'll be the man you need today, can't you understand, can't you understand.

Don't turn away, I'm begging you, you gotta stay.
Each eye's full of tears, won't help me through the love-lost years.
Baby make it the last time, don't walk out on me.
Baby make it the last time, you let me down, you know I need you.
Baby make it the last time, don't walk out on me.
Baby make it the last time, you let me down, you know I need you.
