I don't usually go all in, babe
But you're a hum that I had to play
And you took me all the way
Make me lose more than I could win, babe
And I really need to let you know

I'm not above love, I just ran out of it
I'm not above love, so it's not like I don't care
And I know you're thinking the worst of me
But I hope one day you'll see
I'm not above love, I just ran out of it

You keep robbing my heart like a bank
And I only got myself to blame
You keep robbing my heart like a bank
No thank you, no thank you

I'm not gonna call you in
'Cause you're taking everything
You keep robbing my heart like a bank
No thank you, no thank you

I don't usually overdose
But you're a drug that I had to take
Another fix, I couldn't wait
Now the edge is far too close
So I really need to let you know

You keep robbing my heart like a bank
And I only got myself to blame
You keep robbing my heart like a bank
No thank you, no thank you
I'm not gonna call you in
'Cause you're taking everything
You keep robbing my heart like a bank
No thank you

You took me to a place so far from here
You took me to another atmosphere
But I got so high, I couldn't breathe
And I've been holding, holding, holding, holding, holding, holding

I'm not above love, I just ran out of it
I'm not above love, so it's not like I don't care
And I know you're thinking the worst of me
But I hope one day you'll see
I'm not above love, I just ran out of it

You keep robbing my heart like a bank
And I only got myself to blame
You keep robbing my heart like a bank
No thank you, no thank you

I'm not gonna call you in
'Cause you're taking everything
You keep robbing my heart like a bank
No thank you, no thank you
