[Scarface]
I'm sick of you hoes tryin to run mine 
I'm comin with a good line 
Runnin after one time 
I got a grudge against you blue suits 
Black suits white suits and state troops 
That's the way you made us 
Sent a brother to the penenitentiary is how you play us 
Lock us up for the summer 
Took the brother's name away and passed us as a number 
Just because you legally pack a gack man 
Doesn't necessarily mean you have to point it at the black man 
Especially you black cops 
You let your gacks pop 
Because them honkies got you brainwashed 
Now we come to new dealings 
F*ck all the dumb shit, the line of work is cap peeling 
I'm cuttin shit short 
Ain't no fillin out reports 
Cause you ain't makin it to court 
I'm lettin freedom ring 
From the hole in my glock, for fuckin off Rodney King 
It ain't shit that you can ask us 
And since justice is blind, I'm gone buy the bitch some glasses 
Wake the f*ck up chumps 
I'm comin after your ass 
Crooked officer 

[Chorus]
Mr. Officer, crooked officer 
I want to put your ass in a coffin sir 
Cause you done fucked with niggas like myself for too long 
It's time to grab my motherfuckin shit and get it on 

[Bushwick]
Oh Mr. Officer, crooked officer what's happening 
You beat another black man's ass and now you high tapping friend 
Do I have to move to River Oaks 
And bleach my fuckin skin so I can look like these white folks 
Just to get some assistance 
Because the brutality in my neighborhood is gettin persistent 
Cause you want to harass me yeah 
And if I talk back you want to bust my black ass G 
Just like Rodney King 
But if you try that shit with me, its gonna be a different scene 
Try to pull me over on a dark road 
But I'll be damned if I don't grab my nine and unload 
Until every blue shirt turns red 
You heard what I said 
I want all you crooked motherfuckers dead 
So you better start pickin out your coffin sir 
Cause I'm comin after your ass 

[Chorus]

[Big Mike]
Momma called me up the pther day I got a warrant 
Punk ass laws want to know where the gun went 
Say I shot a nigga the other night at a party 
Lying out they ass I was at home drinkin 40s 
Coolin with my niggas playin dominoes in the kitchen 
A big black nigga did the killin and I'm fittin the description 
And you know they think all black niggas look alike 
So now they got the flashlight lookin for Big Mike 
Jackin niggas up tryin to capture me 
Coppers want to gaffle me 
Tryin to put bullets into the back of me 
Time and time again I told them I didn't do it 
And they knew it 
But they still pursued it 
So them motherfuckers blew 
So now I'm about to grab my shit 
And put them son of a bitches six feet under 
Cause I'm sick of runnin from you motherfuckers 
Turnin tables cause I'm able I ain't fallin victim 
Time to play a game, see the police watch me stick them 
Cause I ain't runnin from the p-o-l-I-c-e never 
Motherfuckin t-I-m-e of day 
They'll have to g-you-t a me 
Off the s-e-t 
And my h double o d 
Fuckin around with the B-I-G 
You'll be in a g-r-a-v-e
