Let there be you, let there be me
Let there be oysters under the sea
Let there be wind and occasional rain
Chilli con carne and sparkling champagne

Let there be birds to sing in the trees
Someone to bless me, whenever I sneeze
Let there be cuckoos, a lark and a dove
But first of all please, let there be love

Let there be cuckoos, a lark and a dove
But first of all please, let there be love
Umm, love, ooh, love, let there be love
