Tonight there's gonna be a whole lot of smoke in the air
Blow it high for the ones who ain't here
Seems like every day we putting one six feet underground
So bless
What goes up must come down

Now my buzz is gone, and I need to re-up on reality
Can't let me see them weak I need to pause on it
Is there any possibility that everyone feels like me

Ashtrays and heartbreaks
I lost some, and since when
So put 'em high, and tell 'em this
You can't aim, but you never missed
Ashtrays and heartbreaks
I lost some, and since when
So raise a glass to the memories and set em' free
And fill up all the ashtrays
Fill up all the ashtrays

Tomorrow when you wake up and realise life ain't fair
Throw it back and make the whole world disappear
You never miss what you had, then it's gone
That is why, something will always go wrong

Now my buzz is gone, and I need to re-up on reality
Can't let me see them weak I need to pause on it
Is there any possibility that everyone feels like me

Ashtrays and heartbreaks
I lost some, and since when
So put 'em high, and tell 'em this
You can't aim, but you never missed
Ashtrays and heartbreaks
I lost some, and since when
So raise a glass to the memories and set em' free
And fill up all the ashtrays
Fill up all the ashtrays

Now my buzz is gone, and I need to re-up on reality
Can't let me see them weak I need to pause on it
Is there any possibility that everyone feels like me

Ashtrays and heartbreaks
I lost some, and since when
So put 'em high, and tell 'em this
You can't aim, but you never missed
Ashtrays and heartbreaks
I lost some, and since when
So raise a glass to the memories and set em' free
And fill up all the ashtrays
Fill up all the ashtrays
