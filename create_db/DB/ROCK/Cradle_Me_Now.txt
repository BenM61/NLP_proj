Passage through time
Leave this place time to erase
My link to myself
Leads me astray 
The whole world in my way
Out of my body, out of my mind
Out of luck and out of time

Sift through the remains 
Enter this cage-disengage
Once it was easy
My best foot forward
As I trip through the same daily non-existing life I call hell

Bloodless, pale
Another empty shell 
Captured mind details
As I loath myself
Can't you see, can't you tell
Safely assumed, I'm not well
Cradle me now, teach me how
Teach me how, cradle me now

Make life not your victim
Resume your identity but don't overload
Seek the riches
Hungry for change, I've got to explore
Hidden recesses, lost in my mind
Trapped forever doing time

Bloodless, pale
Another empty shell 
Captured mind details
As I loath myself
Can't you see, can't you tell
Safely assumed, I'm not well
Cradle me now, teach me how
Teach me how, cradle me now

Bloodless, pale
Another empty shell 
Captured mind details
As I loath myself
Can't you see, can't you tell
Safely assumed, I'm not well
Cradle me now, teach me how
Teach me how, cradle me now

Bloodless, pale
Another empty shell 
Captured mind details
As I loath myself
Can't you see, can't you tell
Safely assumed, I'm not well
Cradle me now, teach me how
Teach me how, cradle me now
