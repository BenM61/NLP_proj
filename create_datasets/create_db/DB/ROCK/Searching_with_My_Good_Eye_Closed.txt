This is my good eye
Do you hear a cow?
A rooster says
Here is a pig
The devil says

Painted blue across my eyes
And tied the linen on
And I'm on my way
Looking for the paradigm
So I can pass it off
Is it on my side, on my side

Is to the sky, is to the sky, is to the sky now
Searching for the ground with my good eye closed

If I took you for a ride, would you take it wrong?
Or would you make it right, make it right?
Looking for a pedestal that I can put you on
And be on my way, on my way

Is to the sky, is to the sky, is to the sky now
Searching for a ground with my good eye closed

With my good eye closed 

Stop you're trying to bruise my mind
I can do it on my own
Stop you're trying to kill my time
It's been my death since I was born
I don't remember half the time if I'm hiding or I'm lost
But I'm on my way, on my way

(Is it to the sky?)
(I'm on my way) to the sky
(I'm on my way) to the sky
(I'm on my way) to the sky
(I'm on my way) to the sky
I'm on my way (to the sky)
To the sky
To the sky
On my way
On my way
Is it to the sky?
Is it to the sky
