Ready, set, go, man, go
I got a girl that I love so

I'm ready
Ready, ready teddy, I'm ready
Ready, ready teddy, I'm ready
Ready, ready teddy, I'm ready-ready-ready to rock 'n' roll

Going to the corner, pick up my sweetie pie
She's my rock 'n' roll baby, she's the apple of my eye

I'm ready
Ready, ready teddy, I'm ready
Ready, ready teddy, I'm ready
Ready, ready teddy, I'm ready-ready-ready to rock 'n' roll

All the flat-top cats and the dungaree dolls
Are headed for the gym to the sock-hop ball
The joint is really jumpin', the cats are going wild
The music really sends me, I dig that crazy style

I'm ready
Ready, ready teddy, I'm ready, woo
Ready, ready teddy, I'm ready
Ready, ready teddy, I'm ready-ready-ready to rock 'n' roll

Going to the corner, pick up my sweetie pie
She's my rock 'n' roll baby, she's the apple of my eye

I'm ready
Ready, ready teddy, I'm ready
Ready, ready teddy, I'm ready
Ready, ready teddy, I'm ready-ready-ready to rock 'n' roll

All the flat top cats and the dungaree dolls
Are headed for the gym to the sock-hop ball
The joint is really jumpin', the cats are going wild
The music really sends me, I dig that crazy style

I'm ready
Ready, ready teddy, I'm ready
Ready, ready teddy, I'm ready
Ready, ready teddy, I'm ready-ready-ready to rock 'n' roll

Gonna kick off my shoes, roll up my faded jeans
Grab my rock 'n' roll baby, pour on the steam
I shuffle to the left, I shuffle to the right
Gonna rock 'n' roll to the early, early night

I'm ready
Ready, ready teddy, I'm ready
Ready, ready teddy, I'm ready
Ready, ready teddy, I'm ready-ready-ready to rock 'n' roll
