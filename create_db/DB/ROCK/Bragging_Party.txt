From the valley of the missing
High lonesome, no pity boy
Bragging party just beginning
All the tales, mythic noise
No cotton, no chloroform
Don't throw me off the dorm
You know what I mean
Fur is flying, I'm on your team

Here are hills, dales, and depths
You are what I need, to hear
So fill the air, with memorized breaths memorized breaths

From the valley of the missing
T-T-Tammy's stoned on dope
No kids, no dogs, no fucking daughters
Just my business loop 
I don't know a thing about it
Crazy dipper thanks a lot
You ride with Rome in your sleep
I'm up but the last one-off

Here are hills, dales and depths
You are what I need, to hear
So fill the air, with memorized breaths memorized breaths

From the valley of the missing
High lonesome
Bragging party just beginning 
Mythic, mythic, mythic men
