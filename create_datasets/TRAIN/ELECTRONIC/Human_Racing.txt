closing in on empty spaces
winners laugh too soon
a paper world with paper faces
beneath a paper moon

there's a man, a real pacesetter
coming after me
and after him there's someone better and
after him there's me

he'll offer you a cigarette
he'll offer you a light
but he hasn't finished with you yet
on another long, knife night

so look behind you
there's the man you're chasing
look behind you
let's go human racing
human racing
let's go racing now

open arms and open purses
open season's here
fill your heads with clever verses
and then they disappear

silent vows in secret places
they'll get you somehow
'cause you never win in human races
so who's the loser now

look behind you
there's the man you're casing
look behind you
let's go human racing
human racing
let's go racing now
