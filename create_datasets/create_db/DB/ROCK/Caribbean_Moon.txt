A rum-lime honey sing a magical tune 
Found her underneath the Caribbean Moon 
Wind is blowin' in the coconut tree 
Blowin' the moonlight over you and me 

Hey Caribbean moon yellow yellow 
Caribbean moon yellow yellow 
Caribbean moon yellow yellow 
Caribbean moon shine all night

Calypso singer singin' in the sun 
Sing about the rivers of Babylon
Rasta music, Caribbean sea
Come on everybody sing the tune with me

Hey Caribbean moon yellow yellow 
Caribbean moon yellow yellow 
Caribbean moon yellow yellow 
Caribbean moon shine all night

When I sing this song it makes me feel so glad
It was very musical, the love we had 
Oh Martha, Martha let me sing to you 
The song about the moon and the big bamboo
