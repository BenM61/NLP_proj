Red light--black lace
It's gonna blow up right in your face
You take the heat, you pay the price
Keep on fingering the merchandise

Squeeze slow, steady all the way
Breathe slowly while you're taking your aim
It's now or never, it's in your sights
Oh--is it safe to say

Do yourself a favor--I'm like a bullet in the chamber
Why don't you do us both a favor, I'm like a bullet in the chamber

I'm cold steel--hot lead
I'm getting in way over my head
I'm wound up--I'm ready to go
Your attitiude tells me what I need to know
So you, you say you like it rough
And you tell me that you want it that way
Do you really think you're tough enough?
Oh, be careful what you say

Do yourself a favor--I'm like a bullet in the chamber
Why don't you do us both a favor and put a bullet in the chamber

Do yourself a favor--I'm like a bullet in the chamber
Why don't you do us both a favor and put a bullet in the chamber
Do yourself a favor--I'm like a bullet in the chamber
Why don't you do us both a favor and put a bullet in the chamber
