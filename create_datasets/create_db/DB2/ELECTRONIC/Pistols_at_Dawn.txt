Hear the wind calling me to leave this place
Yet here we are standing 'round face to face
This burning sky witness the greatest of love
Now it waits patiently to drop from out blood
The time has come to show improve of the one
When all you thought you knew, it's coming undone
Is that you're reaching and you wanted to run
Stand down or show down baby let's get this done

You're looking at me
Me looking at you
We could've have it all, a world of our own
I never thought we could be pistols at dawn!

I was the emperor and you own the sun
Invincible, I can't believe what we've done
Surely we must be more than love on the run
Dancin' in darkness at the sound of a drum
Can't help to wonder what you thought I would do
Lay down and play dead boy you know that ain't true
This is me reaching and you wanting to run
Stand down or show down baby let's get this done

You're looking at me
Me looking at you
We could've have it all, a world of our own
I never thought we could be pistols at dawn!

I'd rather die tonight
If I have to
What would you ever think that I'd take a bullet for you

I'd rather die tonight
If I have to
What would you ever think that I'd take a bullet for you

You're looking at me
Me looking at you
We could've have it all, a world of our own
I never thought we could be pistols at dawn!

Pistols at dawn!
Pistols at dawn!
