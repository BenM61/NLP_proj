You left me you sent me through 
I'm all alone lost without you what shall I do?
Out of the picture out of the frame 
And now when you see me nothings the same
Your lips are kissing somebody new 
I'm out of the picture out of the view
Smile for I've got nothing to smile for 
But I'd still run a mile for any wish you desire 
Dreams we made have faded
Out of your heart now gone is the flame 
I'm out of the picture out of the frame
Out of the picture out of the frame
Your lips are kissing somebody new
Smile for I've got nothing to smile for 
But I'd still run a mile for any wish you desire
Dreams we made have faded
Out of your heart now gone is the flame 
I'm out of the picture out of the frame
Please come back to me because I don't want to be
Out of the picture
