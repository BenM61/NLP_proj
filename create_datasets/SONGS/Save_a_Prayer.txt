You saw me standing by the wall corner of a main street
And the lights are flashing on your window sill
All alone ain't much fun so you're looking for the thrill
And you know just what it takes and where to go

Don't save a prayer for me now 
Save it til the morning after
No don't say a prayer for me now 
Save it til the morning after

Feel the breeze deep on the inside look you down into the well
If you can you'll see the world in all his fire
Take a chance like all dreamers can't find another way
You don't have to dream it all, just live a day

Don't say a prayer for me now
Save it 'til the morning after
No don't say a prayer for me now
Save it 'til the morning after
Save it 'til the morning after
Save it 'til the morning after

Pretty looking road I try to hold the rising floods that fill my skin
Don't ask me why I'll keep my promise melt the ice
And you wanted to dance so I asked you to dance
But fear is in your soul
Some people call it a one night stand but we can call it paradise

Don't say a prayer for me now
Save it til the morning after
No don't say a prayer for me now
Save it 'til the morning after
Save it 'til the morning after
Save it 'til the morning after
Save it 'til the morning after
Save it 'til the morning after (doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo)
Save a prayer 'til the morning after
Save a prayer 'til the morning after
Save a prayer 'til the morning after
Save a prayer 'til the morning after
Save a prayer 'til the morning after
Save a prayer 'til the morning after
