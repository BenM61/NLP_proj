Never gonna let you go
I'm never gonna let you go

I'm starting with my intuition
I'm starting with my strengths
I'm getting back my old ambitions
Returning once again
My knuckles are so red and raw
From breaking through these walls
Sick of all the others talk
And I left her of my fault

I was a spark in the night but you drown me out
So I'll take the walls inside and I'll burn them down

'Cause I still got a fire in me
I never wanna let it go
I never wanna let it go
I-I-I-I still got a fire in me
I never wanna let it go
I never wanna let it go
I-I-I-I still got a fire in me
I never wanna let it go
I never wanna let it go
I-I-I-I still got a fire in me
I never wanna let it go
I never wanna let it go
I-I-I-I still got a fire in me

I've debt with all my evils
And I'm dealing with them twice
There will never be a sequal
And the curtain will never rise
Although my body has been aching
I held on to the ropes, oh no
I've never left the ring, yeah
And I won't be letting go

'Cause I still got a fire in me
I never wanna let it go
I never wanna let it go
I-I-I-I still got a fire in me
I never wanna let it go
I never wanna let it go
I-I-I-I still got a fire in me
I never wanna let it go
I never wanna let it go
I-I-I-I still got a fire in me
I never wanna let it go
I never wanna let it go
I-I-I-I still got a fire in me

I was a spark in the night but you drown me out
So I'll take the walls I'm inside and I'll burn them down
I was a spark in the night but you drown me out
So I'll take the walls I'm inside and I'll burn them down

'Cause I still got a fire in me
I never wanna let it go
I never wanna let it go
I-I-I-I still got a fire in me
I never wanna let it go
I never wanna let it go
I-I-I-I still got a fire in me
I never wanna let it go
I never wanna let it go
I-I-I-I still got a fire in me
I never wanna let it go
I never wanna let it go
I-I-I-I still got a fire in me
I-I-I-I still got a fire in me
I-I-I-I still got a fire in me
