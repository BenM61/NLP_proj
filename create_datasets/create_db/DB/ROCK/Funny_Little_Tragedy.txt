Life has finally shown you
It's a mean old world
The killer little soldier
Is now a scared little girl

Always had everything
Just handed to you
Always had it your way
I got to hand it to you

And seeing you now
All broken down, I gotta say

It's a funny little tragedy
A funny little tragedy
A funny little tragedy

Your standing on my doorstep
You say you've got nowhere to go
You're all soaking wet
I've never seen you so low

Sorry if I don't fall
For your tricks again
But I seem to recall
The way you did me in

And now your new lover
Has left you high and dry, I gotta say

It's a funny little tragedy
A funny little tragedy
A funny little tragedy

Yeah I dream about this day
Seeing you go down this way
That's all I got to say

Maybe some day
If I see you again
Things will be different
And we can be friends

But for now I believe
You better walk away
The little soldier and me
We go our separate ways

I can watch you walking
Tears running down your face

It's a funny little tragedy
A funny little tragedy
A funny little tragedy

Yeah, I dream about this day
Seeing you down this way
That's all I got to say
