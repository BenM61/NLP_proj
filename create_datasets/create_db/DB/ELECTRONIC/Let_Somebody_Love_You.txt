I am a poet in New York City
You can see your face in my shoes
I'm young and I'm alive, I've got nothing to lose
A dream, a broken lie, a kiss, so much to resist
And then I find you

I am fire, you are water, nothing we can do
I walk into the room and light your fuse

Love is revolution
War and famine too
Feed the hunger in your heart
Let somebody love you
Let somebody love you

Now I'm in the wilderness, somewhere in the heart of Spain
Youth lights it up with a smile saying "Sing it again"
A dream, a broken lie, a kiss, so much to resist
And then I find you

I am fire, you are water, nothing we can do
I walk into the room and light your fuse

Love is revolution
War and famine too
Feed the hunger in your heart
Let somebody love you
Let somebody love you

Live and direct, got a boy or a girl in your hand
Could it be something I did or something you said
Live and direct, got a boy or a girl in your hand
When the two sevens come together
I'm gonna love you forever and ever

I am fire, you are water, nothing we can do

Love is revolution
War and famine too
Feed the hunger in your heart
Let somebody love you

Let somebody love you
(Let somebody love you)

A dream, a lie, a poke or a kiss (let somebody love you)  
So much to resist, yeah (let somebody love you)
Gotta let someone love you (let somebody love you)
Need to let somebody love you (let somebody love you)
