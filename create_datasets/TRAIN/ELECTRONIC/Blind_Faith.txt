Sweet sensation

I am the man with the heavy heart
And I dare not turn the pages
Riding with automatic self destruction
I Is a blind faith, a cruel waste
One bitter taste
So I know I need this sweet sensation

Sweet sensation
The music that we play
Will ease your mind
Will ease your mind

What is a man now to do with his mind
when it's working over time
The best I can do is now dance with the devil
I, keep my self safe
I won't waste this time and space
So I know I need this sweet sensation

Sweet sensation
The music that we play
Will ease your mind
Will ease your mind

I am the man with the heavy heart
I am the man with the heavy heart
Is a blind faith, a cruel waste, one bitter taste
So I know I need this sweet sensation

Sweet sensation
The music that we play
Will ease your mind
Will ease your mind

I am the man with the heavy heart
I am the man with the heavy heart
Is a blind faith, a cruel waste, one bitter taste
So I know I need this sweet sensation
