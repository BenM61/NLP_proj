(Chris Youlden) Chrysalis Music Ltd.
Ain't got time for doubts or fears
Ain't got time for shallow tears
Ain't got time to bare my soul
Because I still got a hard way to go

Said that you got a losing hand
Ain't no point in you raising sand
Ain't got time to bare your soul
Because I still got a hard way to go

And it's a crying shame
That you can't lay the blame
On anybody else but yourself

Wish that you had my sympathy
You ain't got no hold on me
And my heart is getting cold
And I still got a hard way to go

And it's a crying shame
That you can't lay the blame
On anybody else but yourself

And I still got a hard way to go
