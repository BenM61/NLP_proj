I see you coming down
Your life is flashing before ya
I see you coming round
You're talking over and over
You know I tried to please ya
You're under anesthesia
I see you coming down

Too bad there's nothing left over
I don't know what you mean
You're talking over and over
You know I tried to please ya
You're under anesthesia
You know I tried to please ya
You're under anesthesia

I see you waking up
And now the day is upon ya
The party's over now
You're talking over and over
You know I tried to please ya
You're under anesthesia
