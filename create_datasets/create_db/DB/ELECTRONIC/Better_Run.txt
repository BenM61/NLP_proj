Once upon a time there lived a girl 
She knew what she wanted from the world 
In the brown eyes they could see 
The fire that burned like summer heat 
Nothing but trouble, so they thought 
They just watched her from afar 
If they looked close, the flame was a tear 
That they had seen a girl so fierce 

You better run, you better run 
You don't know what you're in for 
You don't know,you don't know 
What you're in for 
You better run you better run 'cause 
You don't know what you're in for 

Once upon a time there lived a boy 
He would only play with real life toys 
One hand here and one hand there 
No attachments this man wears 
A smile so sweet it's hard to see 
That there's no fruit growing in his tree 
Once a fool, he learned long ago 
It's better to burn than to feel that cold 

You better run, you better run 
You don't know what you're in for 
You don't know,you don't know 
What you're in for 
You better run you better run 'cause 
You don't know what you're in for  

Play with fire and you will get burned 
Play with fire and you will get burned
Will get burned 
Will-get-burned! 
Burned, burned, burned, burned 
Burned, burned, burned, burned 

You better run you better run 
You don't know what you're in for 
You don't know, you don't know 
What you're in for 
You better run, you better run 'cause 
You don't know what you're for
