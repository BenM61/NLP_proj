You wanna go play, right away
Well I'm fine with that
We smoke and drink all day, baby
And I'm faded like
I can't remember your name, right away, what I'm tryna say
I got that game changed, I got that game changed

I got that game changed and you want it
You've been looking at me strange like you falling
Deep into my gaze, brainwashing
Brainwashing, this is your warning

I'm 'bout to tell you dirty, dirty little secret
I'ma keep it daddy, daddy, can you keep it?
Don't say nothing that you know you gonna regret
Put your hands up in the air
It's a stick up, stick up

I'm a bandit, I'm a bandit, I'm a bandit, I'm a bandit
I'ma throw it, throw it, throw it, throw it, throw it, throw it, throw it up
You can't stand it
Yeah I'm a bandit

This club going cra-azy, like a maniac
Gold in my champagne, I don't care
Where my gangstas at?
Put 'em in the air, one time
Live your life no matter what they say, I do this everyday
I want the money, f*ck the fame

Game changed and you want it
You've been looking at me strange like you falling
Deep into my gaze, brainwashing
Brainwashing, this is your warning

I'm 'bout to tell you dirty, dirty little secret
I'ma keep it daddy, daddy, can you keep it?
Don't say nothing that you know you gonna regret
Put your hands up in the air
It's a stick up, stick up

I'm a bandit, I'm a bandit, I'm a bandit, I'm a bandit
Ima throw it, throw it, throw it, throw it, throw it, throw it, throw it up
You can't stand it 
Yeah I'm a bandit

Ooh, you've been looking for the wrong one baby
Oh yeah, and I know what to do to make you go crazy
Oh yeah, you've been looking for the wrong one baby
Oh yeah, I know what to do to make you go crazy (craz-eee)

'Bout to tell you dirty, dirty little secret
Ima keep it daddy, daddy, can you keep it?
Don't say nothing that you know you gonna regret
Put your hands up in the air
It's a stick up, stick up

I'm a bandit, I'm a bandit, I'm a bandit, I'm a bandit
I'ma throw it, throw it, throw it, throw it, throw it, throw it, throw it up
You can't stand it 
Yeah I'm a bandit
