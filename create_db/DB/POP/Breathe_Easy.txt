Cruel to the eye
I see the way he makes you smile
Cruel to the eye
Watching him hold what used to be mine

Why did I lie?
What did I walk away to find
Oh, why, oh why

I can't breathe easy
Can't sleep at night
'Til you're by my side
No I can't breathe easy
I can't dream yet another dream
Without you lying next to me
There's no air

Curse me inside
For every word that caused you to cry
Curse me inside

I won't forget, no I won't baby
I don't know why (don't know why)
I left the one I was looking to find

Oh, why, oh why, why

I can't breathe easy
Can't sleep at night
'Til you're by my side
No I can't breathe easy
I can't dream yet another dream
Without you lying next to me
There's no air

Out of my mind
Nothing makes sense anymore
I want you back in my life

That's all I'm breathing for

Oh tell me why

Oh won't you tell me why

I can't dream yet another dream
Without you lying by my side
There's no air

I can't breathe easy
Can't sleep at night

'Til you're by my side

'Cause I can't breathe easy

I can't dream yet another dream
Without you lying next to me
There's no air

There's no air.
