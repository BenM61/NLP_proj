You must be a special lady (Billy, you sing the first verse) 
(Come on, Herb, sing, sing it, man)
And a very exciting girl (Al, bring that bass out, man) 
(Hey man, I'll bring it out a little bit more)
You gotta be a special lady (Let's get down once more, come on)
'Cause you got me sittin' on top of the world
Sittin' on top of the world
 
Somehow I knew it would be you
To change my gray skies to blue
It was strange when you called my name
Ever since that day I haven't been the same, ooh
 
Before I met you, my sun didn't want to shine
Then all the warmth suddenly slipped up from behind
Pop (Pop) went the reason in my mind
 
You must be a special lady
And a very exciting girl (Ooh, so exciting)
You gotta be a special lady (What a lady)
'Cause you got me sittin' on top of the world
Sittin' on top of the world
 
I was like a song so out of key
Then you came and gave my soul a melody
For instance, you're pullin' me through
I always lost but now I win with you
 
Before I met you, my sun didn't want to shine
Then all the warmth suddenly slipped up from behind
Pop (Pop) went the reason in my mind
 
You must be a special lady (I got a lady)
And a very exciting girl (So exciting, woo)
You gotta be a special lady
'Cause you got me sittin' on top of the world
Sittin' on top of the world
