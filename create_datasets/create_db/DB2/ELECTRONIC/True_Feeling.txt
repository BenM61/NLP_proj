It's cold out, take my coat now
I wore just for you
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

I feel you in my bones now
Feel you through and through
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

It might get hard when you're growing older
But I'll be here and I'll be your shoulder
I can see it now
I can see it now

And oh my God, hope it never changes
I'll spend my life trying to recreate this
But I don't know how
No I don't know how

It's me and you, ooh
A true feeling, it's a true feeling
It's me and you, ooh
A true feeling, it's a true feeling

Go wild, let your hair down
What you got to lose?
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

We both need fixing
But they can't fix what's true
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Oh my God, hope it never changes
I spend my life tryna recreate this
But I don't know how, no I don't know how

It's me and you, ooh
A true feeling, it's a true feeling
It's me and you, ooh
A true feeling, it's a true feeling

And I still remember that night in September
Ooh, it's a true feeling, true feeling
