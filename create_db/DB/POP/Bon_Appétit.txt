'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon a, bon appétit, baby
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon a, bon appétit, baby

Looks like you've been starving
You've got those hungry eyes
You could use some sugar
'Cause your levels ain't right
I'm a five-star Michelin
A Kobe flown in
You want what I'm cooking, boy

Let me take you
Under candle light
We can wine and dine
A table for two
And it's okay
If you take your time
Eat with your hands, fine
I'm on the menu

Hope you've got some room
For the world's best cherry pie
Gonna hit that sweet tooth, boy

Sweet potato pie (sweet)
It'll change your mind (change)
Got you running back for seconds (running)
Every single night (hey)

I'm the one they say can change your life (Takeoff)
No waterfall, she drippin' wet, you like my ice? (Blast)
Said she want a Migo night, I ask her, "What's the price?" (Hold on)
If she do right, told her get whatever you like (Offset)

I grab her legs and now divide, aight
Make her do a donut when she ride, aight
Looking at the eyes of a dime, make you blind
In her spine and I'm on some diamonds change the climate

Sweet tooth (sweet), no tooth fairy (no)
Whipped cream (whip), no dairy (yeah)
She got her hot light on, screaming, "I'm ready" (hot)
But no horses, no carriage

(Go ahead)
'Cause I'm all that you want, boy (all that you want)
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon a, bon appétit, baby (eat it up, eat it up, eat it up)
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon a, bon appétit, baby (bon appétit)

Under candle light
Bon appétit, baby
