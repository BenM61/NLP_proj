Hello, hello
You put love in my hand
I know, I know it's made of lead
Hello, hello
Science came, a kingdom reigned
Below, below my Charlemagne
And the river always flows, so if you go I will know
By the way, my Charlemagne

Hello, hello
Mars, tried, hide, cried, died
Inside the snow in the winter
Hello, hello
The doctors knew, prescribe me you
Below, below the amber sky
And the river always flows, so if you go I will know
By the way, my Charlemagne
And the river always flows tears of gold
Left me cold do you feel the same my Charlemagne? 

My Charlemagne, my Charlemagne
My Charlemagne, my Charlemagne
Don't go
If only I could show you
Don't go
If only I could show you
Don't go
If only I could show you
Don't go
If only I could show you
And the river always flows
So if you go, I will know
By the way, my Charlemagne 
And the river always flows tears of gold
Left me cold do you feel the same my Charlemagne? 
Charlemagne
