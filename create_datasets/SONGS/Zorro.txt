Sound of hoof beats
Zorro, Zorro, 
Zorro, Zorro, 
Zorro, Zorro
sound of blade going through the air
sound of hoof beats again

Out of the night when the full moon is bright
Comes a horseman known as Zorro
He's already gave his mark of Z with his blade
A Z that stands for Zorro

Zorro, Zorro, Zorro
The fox of cunning and creed
Zorro, Zorro, Zorro
He makes the sign of the Z

Zorro, Zorro, 
Zorro, Zorro, 
Zorro, Zorro

He is alive let the wicked take fright
When they catch the sight of Zorro
He's a friend of the weak and the poor and the meek
This very unique Senor Zorro

Zorro, Zorro, Zorro
The fox of cunning and creed
Zorro, Zorro, Zorro
He makes the sign of the Z

Zorro, Zorro, 
Zorro, Zorro, 
Zorro, Zorro
sound of hoof beats
