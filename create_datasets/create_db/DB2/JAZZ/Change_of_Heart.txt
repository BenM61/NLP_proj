If the sky can change from cloudy to butterfly weather
And the ocean's roar becomes a lullaby
Why can't you why can't you love me
Have a change of heart and be my apple pie

Oh a leopard can't change his spots
And oil and water can't mix
But I have recently heard an old dog learned new tricks

If the icy winds that blast us in December
Can in April bring blossoms to the vine
Why can't you why can't you love me
Have a change of heart and be my valentine

Why can't you why can't you love me
Have a change of heart and be my apple pie
Oh a leopard can't change his spots
And oil and water can't mix
But I have recently heard an old dog learned new tricks

If the icy winds that blast us in December
Can in April bring blossoms to the vine
Why can't you why can't you love me
Have a change of heart and say that you'll be mine
Have a change of heart and say that you'll be mine
Have a change of heart and say that you'll be mine
