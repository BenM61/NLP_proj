Go, you don't have to feel alone,
Time, does not have to be on your side,
When you know home is not very far away

All we need is time
All we need is bah bah

How do you know, how do you sleep at night
I'm not very far, not very far from here,
If I was there, if I was there you'd see

All we need is time
All we need is bah bah
How do you know?
