From the album best of donovan ii

Oh, I dwelt in the north in the green country,
Far-a-mere, far from here;
And dream of the girl with the sunshine eyes
Sundaily, Sundaily;
And I take to my rest at the end of day,
Whilst o'erhead the pretty stars do play.

And I dream along,
And I make a song
About everything that I've known and felt;
And it makes the sadness melt.
Then I wake up in the funny old kind of day,
The rain has gone away,
Watching the children sing and play
In the garden and the roadway.
Up comes a little one singin' a song
About a friend she knows called Rosie.
Off to the green wood you must go,
To bring (h)er a one fine posie.
All of a sudden the night is empty,
You're sad as a butterfly.

Oh I dwelt in the north in the green country,
Far-a-mere, far-a-mere;
And I dwelt with my pride and my songs and things
Wearily, wearily;
And I dream of the girl with the sunshine eyes
Sundaily, wherever she may be.

And I dream along,
And I make a song
About everything that I've known and felt;
And it makes the sadness melt.
Then I wake up in the funny old kind of day,
The rain has gone away
Watching the little ones sing and play
In the garden and the roadway.
Up comes a little one singin' a song
About a friend she knows called Rosie.
Off to the green wood you must go, to bring (h)er a one fine posie.
All of a sudden the night is empty, you're sad as a butterfly.

Oh, I dwelt in the north in the green country,
Far-a-mere, wearily;
And I dream of the girl with the sunshine eyes
Sundaily, wherever she may be.

And I dream along,
And I make a song
About everything that I've known and felt,
And it makes the sadness melt.
