We are in love with you, my heart and I
And we are always true, my heart and I
When you are far away, each smile's a tear
But it's a lovely day when you are near
Maybe that love is blind when passion rules
And that my heart and I are just two fools
And yet, my darling, if you ever say goodbye
I know we both should die, my heart and I

Once in a lifetime a love dream comes true
Just once in a lifetime or never
I met my fate on the day I met you
The moment you kissed me I knew
Strange fascination seems to fill and hold me
Fateful temptation such as no one ever told me
Everything I would endure for you
Come what may, oh, I'll keep smiling through
My heart is yours, so you just take it
It's only asking you not to break it

We are in love with you, my heart and I
And we are always true, my heart and I
When you are far away, each smile's a tear
But it's a lovely day when you are near
Maybe that love is blind when passion rules
And that my heart and I are just two fools
And yet, my darling, if you ever say goodbye
I know we both should die, my heart and I
