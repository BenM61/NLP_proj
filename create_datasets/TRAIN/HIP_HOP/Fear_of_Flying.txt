Yeah  yeah 
Yeah  yeah  yeah 

I got a fear of flying on a plane 
'Cause we got no say on how it ends up 
Well in my mind love's the very same way 
That's why I never give my heart to no one 

I never take a chance 
On a love that lifts me off the ground 
Oh yeah (oh yeah) 
I came to Earth found things 
But I want to spread my wings somehow  somehow 

I've got a fear of flying high 
But I'm prepare to spread my wings 
And it's all in my mind 
Love defies all gravity 

Voices in the wind 
I can hear them welcome me to fly 
Think I'm flying now, flying now, flying now 

Listen 
I've been in love but I fell to fast 
I found myself in turbulent skies 
I felt the hurt when I crashed and burned 
Then I found myself with tears in my eyes 

But when you look at me 
Something says it's gonna be alright, alright 
And all my fears I'll face 
'Cause I think I'm gonna take this flight, oh 

I've got a fear of flying high 
But I'm prepare to spread my wings 
And it's all in my mind 
Love defies all gravity 

Voices in the wind 
I can hear them welcome me to fly 
Think I'm flying now, flying now, flying now 

Ooh suddenly, suddenly 
The other clouds is calling me 
And you're love to me is like therapy 
For my soul, so I'm ready to soar 

Fear of flying high 
Spread my wings 
And it's all in my mind 
Love defies all gravity 

Voices in the wind 
I can hear them welcome me 
Think I'm flying now, flying now, flying now 

Think I'm flying 
Think I'm, think I'm... 

Think I'm flying 
Think I'm, think I'm... 

Fear of flying high 
It's all in my mind 
Voices in the wind 
Think I'm flying now, flying now, flying now 

Fear of flying high 
It's all in my mind 
Voices in the wind 
Think I'm flying now, flying now, flying now
