Dear Robin 
Hope you dont mind me writing, its just that theres more than one thing I 
need to ask you. If youre so anti-fashion, why not wear flares, instead of 
dressing down all the same. Its just that looking like that I can express 
my dissatisfaction. 

Dear Robin 
Let me explain, though youd never see in a million years. Keep quoting 
Cabaret, Berlin, Burroughs, J.G. Ballard, Duchamp, Beauvoir, Kerouac, 
Kierkegaard, Michael Rennie. I dont believe you really like Frank Sinatra. 

Dear Robin 
Youre always so happy, how the hell do you get your inspiration? Youre 
like a dumb patriot. If youre supposed to be so angry, why dont you fight 
and let me benefit from your right? Dont you know the only way to change 
things is to shoot men who arrange things, Dear Robin 
I would explain but youd never see in a million years. Well, youve made 
your rules, but we dont know that game, perhaps Id listen to your records 
but your logics far too lame and Id only waste three valuable minutes of 
my life with your insincerity. 

You see Robin, Im just searching for the young soul rebels, and I cant 
find them anywhere. Where have you hidden them? 

Maybe you should welcome the new soul vision.
