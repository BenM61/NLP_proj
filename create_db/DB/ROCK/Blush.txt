All I want from you is everything
I ever wanted for just one night
And all I care for is for you
To leave me alone
When the morn comes
Take everything we had away from you
And you away from me

[Chorus]
I can't keep you
I can't hold you tight
I can't love you
See, despite my hurtful ways
I can still make you blush

Tremble lips speak
Sound screams
Lover's death
It's time you leave

And all I want from you is all I took

[Chorus x2]
