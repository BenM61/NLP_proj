People hide your eyes
Everything's recording
And one day you're recalling
The writing on the wall is everything's recorded
Looking through my grey lens
I wonder where this clear is
I try to find what I've already found

And I was going through every single moment
Right down to tying my shoelaces
To the first time we said grace
And how we flew together
And how can you knew me better
Than anyone, than anyone?

Because everything's recorded
And nothing is distorted
Deep beneath the surface
Do you know what your worth is?
Beause everything's recorded
And nothing is distorted
Deep beneath the surface
Your apathy is worthless

There's a circuitry of mine
Recording all the time
And right before your time
I feel pleasure realign

'Cause nothing is distorted
You were beautiful just as you are
You were beautiful just as you are
'Cause nothing is distorted
You were beautiful just as you are
You were beautiful just as you are

Because everything's recorded
And nothing is distorted
Deep beneath the surface
Do you know what your worth is?
Because everything's recorded
And nothing is distorted
Deep beneath the surface
Your apathy is, your apathy is worthless
No, no, no

And how you knew me better
Than anyone, than anyone
And how you knew me better
Than anyone, than anyone

I don't have to worry
There'll come a time when I'm in love with you
There'll be a time when you seek the glory
And everything before me
