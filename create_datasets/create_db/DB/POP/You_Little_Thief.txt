You little thief
You let me love you
You saw me stumbling
You watched me fall
You left me broken 
Shattered and bleeding
But there's no hard feelings 
There no feelings at all

You little thief
You little savage
You little beauty 
You little whore
You've taken everything
I had to believe in
Now there's nothing 
To believe in at all

So tell me how does it feel 
To make a grown man wanna die
Does it make you uneasy
Does it every cross your mind

You little dream
You little nightmare
You little nothing
You little girl

You left me broken

There's no hard feelings

Cos when I needed you
You watched me fall
