On the talk back show
On the radio
At the local bar
In the hot traffic 
By the red tail lights

Everybody's down on their knees
Listen like thieves
But who needs that
When it's all in your hands

And we take it down
To the end of town
Where they have control
But they're losing touch
When the lights go out

Everybody's down on their knees
Listen like thieves
But who needs that 
It's all in your hands

Everybody's down on their knees
Listen like thieves
For the end results
But who needs that
When you've got it 
All in your hands
It's all in your hands

It's all in your hands

You are all you need
You are all you need
And that is everything
So don't hesitate
There's no time to waste
You just do it for yourself

I said, everybody's down on their knees
Listen like thieves
But who needs that
When it's all in your hands

You got it all, you got it all
It's all in your hands
You got it all, you got it all

I said, everybody's down on their knees
Listen like thieves
But who needs that
When it's all in your hands
