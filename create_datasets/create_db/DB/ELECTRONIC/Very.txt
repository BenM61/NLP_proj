You would never make it
Inside, oh inside
Love you won't be alone
Inside, oh inside

Pain
It's cold out there
So come inside
So come inside

Pain
It's warm in here
So come inside
So come inside

How we will make it
Just you, you and me
Soon we'll take it
Just you, you and me

Pain
It's cold out there
So come inside
So come inside

Pain
Yeah
Pain
Yeah

Pain
It's cold out there
So come inside
So come inside

Pain
It's cold out there
So come inside
So come inside

Pain
It's warm in here
So come inside
So come inside

Pain 
It's cold out there
So come inside
So come inside
