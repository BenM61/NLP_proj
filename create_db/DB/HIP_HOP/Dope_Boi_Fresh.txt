Yea! A-town nigga
A nigga dope Boi fresh in dis polo and guess
Or the guccI and louie shawty ain't nuthin less
I keep a piece on my side and some beat in my ride
The window up when its hot or when its cold outside
The AC blow snowballs drive a bitch up the wall
With them plush leather guts steady grippin the butt
The paint just drip on the street michael jordan on my feet
With a big booty freak to make the pimpin complete
I go and pick up big floaty he twistin a swisher slowly
Bend the corner ain't no hatin and all the hoes no me
These hoes star struck cause we spendin dem big bucks
Dis chevy got they attention and fuckin dem hoes up

[Chorus: x2]
Dope Boi fresh, dope Boi dope Boi dope Boi (4x)

Ever slang blow all day at da corner sto'
Serve til ya bar get low go and get some mo
Nigga trap til da yay get sold, plain and simple ho
Give a damn if it snows, nigga I don dime day old
Now five days old wit a big bank roll
Hit da club and pull six stank hoes

Wit da rod livers khakis Kangols and polos
Dese other monkey niggaz tacky like hobos
Dope Boi fresh or should I say razor sharp
Catch me in action the definition of pimpin' hard

Swooped up them old Bo Jacksons, sky blue on dem hoes

Jumpin' out brand new dem tennis shoes white white

And a size number seven in dem Ben Hill Heights
