I'm not ashamed of winning
But it wasn't that way in the beginning
It was this way
It was kiss me
Come kick me and diss me
I had to give it up
Now it's a way different feeling
You took my soul I had to steer it back
Now it's this way
Now it's with me
No mistake just listen
I had to give up

All of this pain you had given
It's just a reminder of livin'
It was crazy, had a baby
He's amazin', he saved me
And this time it's just us
You raised up, I can say that
I was too young, I'll never get that back

Now it's this way
Now it's flipped babe
I'm happy, just listen
I had to give it up

I was super cool
But now I'm super strong
I had nothing to loose
But I was super wrong
It was the circumstance
I got the power from
I was super tough
But now I'm super strong
Super strong

I'm a braveheart
I'm a braveheart
I'm a braveheart
So come and play my purple heart
Come and play my purple heart
Come and play my purple heart
I didn't run

I was super cool
But now I'm super strong
I had nothing to loose
But I was super wrong
It was the circumstance
I got the power from
I was super tough
But now I'm super strong
Super strong

I was super cool
But now I'm super strong
I had nothing to loose
But I was super wrong
It was the circumstance
I got the power from
I was super tough
But now I'm super strong
Super strong
