How can I get you to notice that I want you
My heart's on fire with desire 'cause I love you
There's no time for waiting, begging, I would tell you
So there's no doubt, I'll spell it, come give it to me
Give it

Come give your love to me
Come give your love to me
Come give your love to me
Come give your love to me

You've turned the spark of my love into a raging flame
And now I need to convince you to feel the same
So don't you stay over there talkin' 'bout the way I feel
'Cause, baby, talk is cheap, actions speaks louder than words

Come give your love to me
Come give your love to me
Come give your love to me
Come give your love to me

Hey baby love, just don't make me wait
For you, I'm so weak
You know I'll do anything it takes, so I beg you please
