Have you seen my hands
Just look at 'em shake
And the song just keeps on repeating
And the song just keeps on repeating
Drop the needle again
And I dance with your ghost
Oh, but that ain't the way
I can't move on and I can't stay the same

And all my friends say

Hey hey, turn the record over
Hey hey, and I'll see you on the flip side
There you go, turn the key and engine over
Let 'er go, let somebody else lay at her feet

But have you seen my heart
Have you seen how it bleeds
And the nights are so long, baby
Out here in the deep
The tick, ticking of hours, lonely
I hear the alarm
I used to hear when she would sleep in my arms

But better sense says

Hey hey, turn the record over
Hey hey, and I'll see you on the flip side
There you go, turn the key and engine over
Let 'er go, let somebody else lay at her feet

And all my friends say
Hey hey, turn the record over
Hey hey, and I'll see you on the flip side
There you go, turn the key and engine over
Let 'er go, let somebody else lay at her feet

Where you used to be
Where you used to be
Where you used to be here with me
