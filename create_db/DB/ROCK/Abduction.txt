I wake in sweat 
you've come to steal my life away 
some strange electric glow 
of artificial day 
the power breakers closed 
the grid of darkness falls 
shining gleaming black as night 
burning all the light 

whattya want from me 
i sense your mastery 
there's something you won't ever find 
so have your way with me 
this prisoner is never free 
rip me up leave me behind 

are you the truth to sit in judgement on my sins 
evil (laser?) gadgets come to penetrate my skin 
the hanging judge is (open?) 
and I'm damned before his eyes 
another (gender?) system failed 
and many more have tried 

chorus 

solo 

"masterplan moment" 

and so the story goes 
i dreamt this long ago 
highways hidden in the sand 
reveal the troops i know 
they took my worthless heart 
and spat it through their eyes 
Abduction means the end for me 
a million years of misery 

chorus 
so have your way with me 
this soldier's lost victory 
rip me up...
