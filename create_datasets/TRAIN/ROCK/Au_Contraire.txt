David Bowie came to town
Flying overhead
"Don't you dig my chops?" he cried
This is what they said 

Au contraire, Dave
Quite the opposite, in fact
As it happens, au contraire
Au contraire, mon frare 

Franklin Delano Roosevelt
Knew not what to do
"This tie clashes with my hat," he cried
"Don't you think that's true?" 

Au contraire, Delano
Hate to rain on your parade
I need to tell you au contraire
Au contraire, mon frare 

Jodie Foster held two pair
Bach had three of a kind
Gandhi said, "With my full house,
I will blow your mind!" 

Au contraire, Mahatma
Hate to contradict you, but
As it happens, au contraire
Au contraire, yes au contraire 

And au contraire, you square
Wash that notion from your hair
If you're still there, I must declare
That au contraire, mon tras
Bon frae 

Right on!
