How do I feel for thee?
You smell of great disease
'Cause we're young
Fell in from the stars

When your skin is dead
On a pile of your head
Now then, I look so smart

Stove burn on my hands
Show them to my friends
Make you participate, okay
Eyes roll back around
When skulls hit the ground
Visions to procreate

Heaven should interfere
I'm coming from your tears
When they wander into their cage
So their arms and thighs
And their holy covered eyes
Just yet, will never age

Stove burn on my hands
Show them to my friends
Make you participate, okay
Eyes roll back around
When skulls hit the ground
Visions to procreate

Stove burn on my hands
Show them to my friends
Make you participate, okay
Eyes roll back around
When skulls hit the ground
Visions to procreate

Stove burn on my hands
Show them to my friends
Make you participate, okay
Eyes roll back around
When skulls hit the ground
Visions to procreate

Stove burn on my hands
Show them to my friends
Make you participate, okay
Make you participate, okay
