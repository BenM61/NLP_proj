I am wrecked. I am overblown.
I am also fed up with the common cold.
But I just need to say goodbye
To all the metaphors and lies
That have taken me years to come up with.

Say it's true. Say you like me.
(I like you.)
Just for the night, for me, it's been eternity...

And as I gently sip this drink,
I think about my lack of future,
And of all the places I could learn to fall in love.

I know I shouldn't waste my time,
I should have been better designed,
Therefore, some things still break.

I am wrecked. I am overblown.
I am also fed up with the fucking common cold!
When I just want to feel alive for the first time in my life,
I just want to feel attractive today.
