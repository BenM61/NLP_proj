Everybody's here with me 
(We) got no camera to see 
Don't think I'm all in this world 
The camera won't let me roll
And the verdict doesn't love our soul 
The digital won't let me go 

Yeah yeah yeah 
I'll pay (yeah yeah yeah) 
When tomorrow 
Tomorrow comes today 

Stereo I want it on 
It's taken me far too long 
Don't think I'm all in this world 
I don't think I'll be here too long 
I don't think I'll be here too long 
I don't think I'll be here too long 

Yeah yeah yeah 
I'll pay 
When tomorrow 
Tomorrow comes today
