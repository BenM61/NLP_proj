Sunday night and we're still in bed
Had the best night I've ever had
And I'm next to you
There's nothing I'd rather do
That same old song, going 'round my head
My feet hurt, I've never danced so bad
I'm falling for you 
When I hear you humming that tune
I can't take my eyes off you, off you

Baby, you are flawless when you're on the floor
You stole my heart, you must be some kind of criminal
Girl, you break the law, it makes me want you more
You got me feeling something different I know I'm yours
Know I'm yours

Hmm hmm

Too shy to talk to you at seventeen
Older now, you're no longer a dream
And you're next to me
There's no place I'd rather be
Oh, 'cause we'll be dancing when we're sixtyfour
Our kids don't call us much anymore
And it'll be you and me
Still feeling young, wild, and free
You make me feel young, wild, and free

Baby, you are flawless when you're on the floor
You stole my heart, you must be some kind of criminal
Girl, you break the law, it makes me want you more
You got me feeling something different I know I'm yours
Know I'm yours

Know I'm yours, know I'm yours
Know I'm yours, know I'm yours
Know I'm yours, know I'm yours
I know I'm yours
Know I'm yours, know I'm yours

You must be some kind of criminal (I know I'm yours)
You must be some kind of criminal (baby you're flawless)
You must be some kind of criminal (oh when' you're on the floor, you)
You stole my heart

Baby, you are flawless when you're on the floor
You stole my heart, you must be some kind of criminal (when you're on the floor)
Girl, you break the law, it makes me want you more
You got me feeling something different I know I'm yours
Know I'm yours (you stole my heart)

Know I'm yours, know I'm yours
Know I'm yours, know I'm yours (you must be)
You must be some kind of criminal (know I'm yours, know I'm yours)
You must be some kind of criminal (know I'm yours, know I'm yours)

Sunday night and we're still in bed
Had the best night I've ever had
And I'm next to you
There's nothing I'd rather do
