Aw shucks, hush your mouth, baby you knockin' me out
I said, shucks, a-hush your mouth, baby you knockin' me out
You my kind a woman, you know what it's all about

When ya say, the sweet things, they ring all in my head
Yeah, when ya say, the sweet thing, they ring all in my head
You've got me on the run, an' honey I can't leave you

Hush hush, shut your mouth, baby you knockin' me out
Oh, hush hush, shut your mouth, baby you knockin' me out
All the good in me, you know you bringin' it out, oh
