When all is said and done
I'll always be your son
But all is not forgiven
Well I'm on my knees pleading
Just 'cause I'm grown you think I don't need
Much more than what you've ever given me

So when we gonna get together
Seems there's no time for me
You act like you got forever
You've got time, but you ain't got time for me
You said you've got time
But you ain't got time for me

Now that you've gone and tossed
The bottle away now will ya
Start a new life with the new wife
Well she'll never be my mother
I suppose that you know you oughta
Remember the ones you left behind

So when we gonna get together
Seems there's no time for me
You act like you got forever
You've got time, but you ain't got time for me
You said you've got time
But you ain't got time for me

You're just letting it slip away now
You act like things are fine
I know you think you've been born again
But this time

You're leaving your son behind
This time
This time
This time
