You can lie to yourself, You can lie to the world
You can lie to the one you call your girl
You can humble yourself to the hearts that you stole
Wondering who's gonna love you when you grow old

With a fistful of courage and a heart full of rage 
I realized I'd locked myself in a cage
I'll be the one standing there with the watery eyes
I'll be the fool in the mirror asking me "why?"

Asking "Why?"

When I got to the end of my dirty rainbow
And I found that there was no pot of gold
Well I'd learned that I was empty and not quite as strong
For I'd robbed my heart and cheated my soul

Look for the one with the watery eyes 
I'll be the fool in the mirror asking me "why?"
Cursing the lovers in a warm, tender embrace
Scoffing at the world and the whole human race

You can run, you can hide
You can feed your foolish pride
You can use and abuse
In the end, you'll always lose at the game

You can run, you can hide
You can feed your foolish pride
With the hearts that you stole
And the empty pot of gold
And the lovers warm embrace
And the whole damn human race

You can use, and abuse
In the end you'll always lose at the game

For I cheated myself at solitaire
