Part 1 

The sun is going down 
Day slowly fades 
Another week has gone 
Slipped away 

Tension's flowing out from you 
Like from a spring 
You free your mind , you free your soul 
The calm sinks in 

You got to let your body talk 

Part 2 

Grab your phone, call some friends 
Ask if they are free to go out 
The whole night 

Step in the shower, have a light dinner 
Dress yourself a way in which you'll feel all right 
Not too tight 

Down in the subway, you watch the people there 
Heading toward the spot where they'll find a rest 
Or romance 

You jump off the train, you cross a traffic jam 
You pass through the club doors where the music is living 
The people are flying, the DJ's ripping 
You got to let your body talk
