I want to tell about my baby, speak of her with pride
She go out of the way to make me satisfied
She's my baby, she's my baby, well, that's true
Well, I can't call her sugar, sugar never was so sweet

Well, I ain't no surprised, she serve me in the bed
She manicure my nails, scratch dandruff from my head
She's my baby, she's my baby, what a treat
Well, I can't call her sugar, sugar never was so sweet

And if I say what I want, that's the way it gonna be
She fell over backwards, you know that pleases me
She's my baby, she's my baby, don't you see?
Well, I can't call her sugar, sugar never was so sweet
