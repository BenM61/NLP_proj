Gotta get you out of my mind
Gotta get you into my life

I know that you're down
But the way you're watchin' me
You're takin' words away and I can hardly speak
There's just room for two in my fantasy
So baby lose your crew and come away with me

Turn down the lights and light up the party
I got the ride and you got the naughty
Leave your boys and your girls tonight
Come home to me ASAP
Turn down the lights and light up the party
I got the time and you got the body
Leave your boys and your girls tonight
Come home to me ASAP

Tonight's the night and it's only just begun
All the boys and girls that want to f*ck tonight
Gotta turn the naughty on 
Gotta turn the naughty on 

I like what you say by the way you rock your shows
And the way you wear your smile 
Got me really diggin' you
Oh this bump and grind makes everyone afraid
Let's get out of sight
Baby run away with me

Turn down the lights and light up the party
I got the ride and you got the naughty
Leave your boys and your girls tonight
Come home to me ASAP
Turn down the lights and light up the party
I got the time and you got the body
Leave your boys and your girls tonight
Come home to me ASAP

Tonight's the night and it's only just begun
All the boys and girls that want to f*ck tonight
Gotta turn the naughty on 
Gotta turn the naughty on

Gotta get you out of my mind
Gotta get you out of my head
Gotta get you into my life
Gotta get you in my bed
Gotta get you in my bed

Turn down the lights and light up the party
I got the ride and you got the naughty
Leave your boys and your girls tonight
Come home to me ASAP

Tonight's the night and it's only just begun
All the boys and girls that want to f*ck tonight
Gotta turn the naughty on 
Gotta turn the naughty on

Tonight's the night and it's only just begun
All the boys and girls that want to f*ck tonight
Gotta turn the naughty on 
Gotta turn the naughty on
