I love Christmas in the snow
But Christmas in the sand don't end
I tell you that's where it's at

Hawaiian Tropic on my skin
A candy cane of peppermint, a hint
Of cocoa on my lips

It could've been the sun
It could've been the sea
It could've been my childhood fantasy

I saw Santa in his bathing suit
Tried to catch a wave, but he tried to soon
He laughed so hard that he could barely breathe
And washed up next to me

He said that you look naughty
But I'm sure you're nice
He was soaking wet but he cracked a smile
With a present in his hand
He said it's Christmas in the sand

I must have had too much to drink
'Cause Rudolph's nose was shining green, I think
He was playing reindeer games on me
Santa only called him once
But you should've seen him run so fast
They were gone in a dash

It could've been the sun
It could've been the sea
It could've been my childhood fantasy

I saw Santa in his bathing suit
Tried to catch a wave, but he tried to soon
He laughed so hard that he could barely breathe
And washed up next to me

He said that you look naughty
But I'm sure you're nice
He was soaking wet but he cracked a smile
With a present in his hand
He said it's Christmas in the sand

Christmas in the sand, whoa
Christmas in the sand, whoa
Christmas in the sand, whoa
Christmas in the sand, whoa

Don't need your winter coat
Don't need your winter hat
Just grab the one you love
And say you're never coming back

If you see Santa in his bathing suit
Tried to catch a wave, but he tried to soon
He laughed so hard that he could barely breathe
It's what he did to me

He said that you look naughty
But I'm sure you're nice
He was soaking wet but he cracked a smile
With a present in his hand
He said it's Christmas in the sand

Christmas in the sand, whoa
Christmas in the sand, whoa
Christmas in the sand, whoa
I love Christmas in the sand
