Thou shall not cry!

Last fire will rise, behind those eyes
Black house will rock, blind boys don't lie
Immortal fear, that voice so clear
Through broken walls, that scream I hear

Cry little sister (thou shall not fall)
Come, come to your brother (thou shall not die)
Unchain me sister (thou shall not fear)
Love is with you brother (thou shall not kill)

Blue masquerade, strangers look up
When will they learn, this loneliness
Temptation heat, beats like a drum
Deep in your veins, I will not lie

Cry little sister (thou shall not fall)
Come, come to your brother (thou shall not die)
Unchain me sister (thou shall not fear)
Love is with you brother (thou shall not kill)

(Last fire, come to me
Cry, little sister, cry for me)

My Shangri-la
I cant forget
Why you were mine
I need you now

Cry little sister (thou shall not fall)
Come, come to your brother (thou shall not die)
Unchain me sister (thou shall not fear)
Love is with you brother (thou shall not kill)
