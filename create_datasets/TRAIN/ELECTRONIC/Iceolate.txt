Burning from the inside 
Working on the ground 
Iceolate the problem 
Don't let life bring you down 
Seeing through the eyes of evil 
Confusion takes a hold 
Ignorance the sign of times 
The lessons to be learned 
Fight back 
Bring down the fear 
No control 
All systems clear 
Fight back 
Bring down the fear 
No control 
All systems clear 
masked killers rule the street 
Victims all the same 
Authorized by society 
Misrule rules the world 
Here for certain ? 
pain will be a trend 
Indifference to the difference 
They'll never end 
Bringing down the enemy 
You've got to break those chains 
You've got to fear our soul 
Systems got to change 
Fight back 
Bring down the fear 
No control 
All systems clear 
Fight back 
Bring down the fear 
Iceolate, iceolate 
Your bodies (?) will stain the world 
Stricken with grief 
Inferior conscience violates 
Mutilates the mind 
Fight back 
Bring down the fear 
No control 
All systems clear 
Fight back 
Bring down the fear 
No control 
All systems clear 
masked killers rule the street 
Victims all the same 
Authorized by society 
Misrule rules the world 
Here for certain ? 
pain will be a trend 
Indifference to the difference 
They'll never end 
Bringing down the enemy 
You've got to break those chains 
You've got to fear our soul 
Systems got to change 
Fight back 
Bring down the fear 
No control 
All systems clear 
Fight back 
Bring down the fear 
Iceolate, iceolate 
Your bodies (?) will stain the world 
Stricken with grief 
Inferior conscience violates 
Mutilates the mind 
Fight back 
Bring down the fear 
No control 
All systems clear 
Iceolate, iceolate 
Iceolate, iceolate 
"to ya"
