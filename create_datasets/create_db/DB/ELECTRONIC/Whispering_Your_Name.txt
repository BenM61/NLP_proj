When she said that you were through
I thought that there was 
Nothing that I could do
Just because she ran right here
Doesn't mean I interfered
Now I'm wondering 
If we can feel the same

'Cause she keeps whispering your name
She keeps on whispering your name
Like she's just waiting

She once told me how she felt
Didn't just want me 
To hear it from someone else
There were unknowns she couldn't know
But she hoped you two would grow
And when you didn't 
She was brought to me in pain

And she keeps whispering your name
She keeps on whispering your name
Like she's just waiting
If it's just a little fling
A simple thing
I'll try not to pretend
If it's just for jealousy
She's using me
That might be hard to mend
Oh what else can I do
But try to give her 
More than she got from you
And when she wakes up suddenly
And she says your name to me
I'll just hope it's force of habit 
And not need

'Cause she keeps whispering your name
She keeps on whispering your name
Like she's just waiting
Oh tell me what is fair
When nothing's wrong and
She just stares
Like she's just waiting
