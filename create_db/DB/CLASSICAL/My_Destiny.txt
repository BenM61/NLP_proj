My destiny 
Your smile is my destiny
And I must be what you want me to be

My future lies
Beyond the stars in your eyes
When you are near life is sheer ecstasy

Take my arms 
For you alone can make my arms
A heavenly cathedral
By sharing my embrace
My warm embrace

My destiny 
Your kiss is my destiny
And I'm content never more to be free
Your lips control 
My very heart and my soul
And I am chained 
To my destiny
