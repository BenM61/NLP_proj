What your mother don't know, she won't mind
Her good advice was a waste of time
You wanna live fast, cutting it fine
Make hay while the sun shines

No one there to say, you're wrong or right
You've waited a lifetime
Burning all your bridges tonight

This is the wild life
It's the wild life
Wild life
This is the wild life

No stone left unturned
Jump in the fire you're gonna get burned
You might lose your way
When you come out to play the wild life

I may be too young but I've seen and done
Everything that they say is fun
I gotta find out for myself
In the end there's no one else

Every time I try to win I lose
I'm tired of waiting
Now I'm gonna make my own rules

This is the wild life
It's the wild life
Wild life
This is the wild life

No stone left unturned
Jump in the fire you're gonna get burned
You might lose your way
When you come out to play the wild life

No one there to say you're wrong or right
You've waited a lifetime
Burning all your bridges tonight

This is the wild life
It's the wild life
Wild life
This is the wild life

No stone left unturned
Jump in the fire you're gonna get burned
You might lose your way
When you come out to play the wild life
