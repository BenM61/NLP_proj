In the school of this present day kids 
Are informed to look out for Aids,
But no one says, not a single word, 
'bout a change of lifestyles and ways,
Listen prophets of this modern day, 
Maybe sometime you could be wrong,
'Cause what you preach, someone else must reap 
This generation next to come,
Learn protection, break out of line,
Save the action for the holy time,
Call it old fashioned, 
But it's more like timeless information,
But we can't just educate all things away.

Staying away,
Save your life all the way,
It's not true; you will not be alone,
Dare to say no,
Peer pressure must go,
Stay alive in the "I'm waiting" zone.

Staying away,
Save your life all the way,
It's not true; you will not be alone,
Dare to say no,
Peer pressure must go,
Stay alive in the "I'm waiting" zone,
Staying away,
Save your life all the way,
It's not true; you will not be alone,
Dare to say no,
Peer pressure must go,
Stay alive in the "I'm waiting" zone.

Staying away,
Save your life all the way,
It's not true; you will not be alone,
Dare to say no,
Peer pressure must go,
Stay alive in the "I'm waiting" zone, yeah, yeah.
