K-I-S-S-I-N-G

(Ah) Uh huh uh huh baby
(Ah) Uh huh uh huh baby
(Ah) Uh huh uh huh baby (Woo)

I want to, I want to, I want to, I want to
I need a, I need a, I need a, I need a

A lover, a lover, a lover, a lover
A lover, a lover, a lover, a loverboy for me

Is it the glitter on her breast
Or the gloss on her lips
Hickeys on the chest
Or the toss of the hips
I'm lost in the mix
So I floss in the sea
Turning out the hits
That only exist in your dreams

It's the mo' maker
Dough chaser
Now get it right, would ya heart breaker
I keep it tight
But I'm no faker
Can laugh now
But you'll cry later

I think I like you in ya freak clothes
Freak those in my specialized peep shows
And then I'll make ya
Touch ya knees to ya elbows
Toes, girl from the street of Melrose

It's clear to see I like it when we smoke that
Choke that, I'll freak that (No doubt)
You kind of got me like
In a freeze when you roll out
You got itchy balls from where I blow that

I got myself a lover
Who loves what I like
When he invites me over
I come every time
Oh my sugar daddy
Takes me for a ride
Whatever way we're going
I expect to leave on time

He's all mine
And his loving makes me high
Like a taste of ecstasy
All I need is him to be my loverboy

Loverboy, come on and love me
Give me more
Touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long (Baby all night long)
Loverboy come on and take me
Only you know how to make me
Shudder with anticipation
All night long (All night long)

I got myself a lover
And he's so sublime
It's quite a bit of heaven
To feel him inside
So come on sugar daddy
Take me for a ride
Whatever way we're going
I expect to leave on time

I get weak
And his candy's just so sweet
When he caressed my whole body
All I need is him to be my loverboy

Loverboy, come on and love me
Give me more
Touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long (I enjoy the way you rock me)
Loverboy come on and take me
Only you know how to make me
Shudder with anticipation
All night long

Well I'm kind of innocent
A vision of love
You adore me
Even though my image is thug

What I see in you
Is for my eyes only to see
I bring out the freak in you
Up and down on me
I'm your lovergirl

Me your loverboy
But when we roam alone
We come touch toys
Making noise we can't avoid

The way I throw that
Can't pop, backdrop, stopwatch, Brat-tat
Get ya more rock
Hard up
All of the things that you wanna do to me
If you wanna, we can get obscene
My cream and you're ding-a-ling mingle
Bother me not
When the sensation come out

I'll make you scream
Uh huh uh huh baby
Feel me
When I pump the pump lady
Behind me we can be close like family
You're so sweet you taste like all types of candy
Starburst to jellybeans

Banana split my dairy queen
Butterfinger my tangerines
Chickens only taste my
Loverboy in they dreams
All my ladies
Let me hear you scream
Hate on me
As much as you want to
You can't do
What the f*ck I do
Bitches be emulating me daily (daily)
Hate on me
As much as you want to
You can't be
Who the f*ck I be
Bitches be imitating me lately (Loverboy)

Loverboy, come on and love me
Give me more (Give it to me)
Touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long (Strawberry)
Loverboy come on and take me (Raspberry)
Only you know how to make me (All those good things)
Shudder with anticipation (Diamonds and gumdrops)
All night long (That's what you seem to me)

Loverboy, come on and love me (Oh)
Give me more
Touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long (Let's get this started now)
Loverboy come on and take me (Let's get this started now)
Only you know how to make me
Shudder with anticipation (Strawberry)
All night long (Raspberry)
