Those happy hours I spend with you
That lovely afterglow
Most of all I miss you so

Your sweet caresses, each rendezvous
Your voice so soft and low
Most of all I miss you so

You once filled my heart with no regrets - no tears
Now you find my heart filled to the top with tears

I'll always love you and want you too
How much you'll never know
Most of all I miss you so

I'll always love yo and want you too
How much you'll never know
Most of all I miss you so
Thank you
