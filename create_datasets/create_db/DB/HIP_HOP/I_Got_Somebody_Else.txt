I got somebody
I got some
I got somebody
I got some
I got somebody
I got some
I got somebody, I
Was a fool to let you in
After all the things you did to me
I wasn't happy, oh
You held me open like you did
Didn't see the things I shoulda seen
Now you remind me
1 - I used to cry every night
You weren't here
Shoulda been by my side
And now it's time I'm saying that I
Am making it clear
You should be saying bye bye
'cause I
2 - I got somebody else
The one I've waited for
He gives me loving, all that I wish for
I got somebody else
Someone who's really sure
I'm so in love
He's all that I wish for
You still hang out with your friends
Fool around and then pretend to be
Thinking about me, oh
But now I got somebody new
Who doesn't treat me like you used to do
And now he's my baby boo
Repeat 1
Repeat 2
You did me wrong
When I moved on
I was free to find someone who loved me
I made up my mind
To leave you behind
Now I got somebody else
Repeat 2
I've got somebody else
I've got somebody else
I've got somebody else
I've got somebody else
I
The one I've waited for
Someone I've waited for
Got somebody, I
I
The one I've waited for
The one I've waited for
Got somebody, I
I
The one I've waited for
Someone I've waited for
Got somebody, I
