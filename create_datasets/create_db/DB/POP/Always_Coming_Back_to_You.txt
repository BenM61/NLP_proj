What was it like when we were young
Sleeping in each others arms
Walking in each others dreams
Was it only yesterday
I've forgotten anyway

What was it like to hear your name
Where's the girl that I once knew
Running home through winter parks
Arm in Arm and heart in heart
Now like children in the dark
We hold hands and watch the rain

When you kissed my eyes awake
Running mornings crowded streets
Just to find we've missed our bus
But we'd laugh , kiss, what the hell

When you'd burst in from the rain
Clasp my head between your hands,
Kiss away the darkest day
Always there to understand.
You could make me proud again

Now I go aimlessly at night
Sleep with faces I don't know 
Always coming back to you
And the shadows of this room

I must search you eyes again
Just to find that they are dead

Always coming back to you
