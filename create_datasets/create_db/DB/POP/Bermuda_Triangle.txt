We decide to get away 
And have some fun 
Book a room and catch a flight 
For two weeks in the sun 
She says, "Hawaii's too expensive." 
I say, "Barbados isn't bad." 
She says, "I'd love to see Bermuda." 
And I say, "Woman, are you mad!" 

Bermuda Triangle It makes people disappear 
Bermuda Triangle Don't go too near 
But she Doesn't see my angle 
And she thinks I'm being dumb 
So Bermuda Triangle 
Here we come! 

Lying with my woman on The island sand 
I look up and see her with 
A stranger, hand in hand 
I see her sitting on his blanket 
I see them going for a swim 
And when I run to find my woman 
I find her running after him! 

Bermuda Triangle 
Makes my woman disappear 
Bermuda TriangleDon't go too near 
Looking At it from my angle 
Do you see why I'm so sad 
Bermuda Triangle Very bad! 

Lying lost and lonely on 
The island sand, 
When a lovely stranger says 
Hello and takes my hand 
And soon she's sitting on my blanket 
And then we're going for a swim 
When I say, "what about your boyfriend?" 
She turns and waves goodbye to him! 

Bermuda Triangle It makes people disappear 
Bermuda Triangle Don't go to near 
But look At it from my angle 
And you'll see what I'm so glad 
Now Bermuda Triangle Not so bad!
