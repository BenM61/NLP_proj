C'mon
Hey, if you really wanna move
Hey, hey, you got to get movin'
Hey, if you really wanna move
Hey, hey, you got to get movin'

Yeah, on your mark, get set, here we go
Time to make your future unfold
And put aside what's killing your growth
You know what's best for ya so let's go

Holla back if you really feel me
Holla back now if you are with me
No time to waste the clock is tickin'
Enough wishin' the walls out of commission

Ain't no superstition
No need to make your own prediction
Your destiny is in your possession
How bad you want it is the question

If you really wanna move you got to get movin'
Got to get movin'
Nothin' left to do except to just do it
Got to just do it

If you want it want it go and go and get it, get it
You don't have to wait anymore
I can hear him calling, step through the door
Where anything is possible, oh, oh

We're on a mission
A mission to bring you what you're missing
No superstition, this vision has intuition

I get irate take the whole cake
When you hate, I levitate then
Migrate to a mind state
When he appropriates a new faith

Hey, we came just to change the whole game
And we aim to maintain that one name that
You've heard whispered among listeners, hit nerves
Be-be-burn like perm fixtures
Sisters and gentleman alike, there's a brand new dance tonight
Now get it hype

If you really wanna move you got to get movin'
Got to get movin'
Nothin' left to do except to just do it
Got to just do it

If you want it, want it go and go and get it, get it
You don't have to wait anymore
I can hear him calling, step through the door

We're going live on the mic tonight in the studio
Speaking truth and life into your stereo
We're going live on the mic tonight in the studio
Speaking truth and life into your stereo

Hey, if you really wanna move
Hey, hey, you got to get movin'
Hey, if you really wanna move
Hey, hey, you got to get movin'

If you want it, want it go and go and get it, get it
You don't have to wait anymore
(You don't have to wait anymore, it's all yours for sure)
Take a step through the door
(Let your faith walk it out now, walk it out now)

You don't have to wait anymore
(You don't have to wait anymore, it's all yours for sure)
It's time to take a step through the door
(Let your faith walk it out now, walk it out now)

Holla back if you really feel me
