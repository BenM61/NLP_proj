Oh
Yeah
Oh oh

You complete me
Like air and water boy
I need thee
And when I'm in your arms I feel free
Fallen
My heads up in the clouds in love

I'm proud
To you say it loud
Like an accident it happened
Out of nowhere
It just happened
And I ain't mad at all
Because I've

[Chorus: x1]
Fallen
Head over heels
I've fallen
In love with you
I've fallen
And I can't get up
Don't wanna get up
Because of love (Because of love)

Baby
To let you get away is crazy (Let you get away)
So I'm doing what it takes 
To make you pledge your love to me
You see cause I'm tryin' to be a lady
For ever and ever baby
The picture wouldn't be the same
If you weren't standing next to me
Can't you see I'm fallen

[Chorus x1]
Fallen
Head over heels
I've fallen (I'm fallen)
In love with you
I've fallen (Oh)
And I can't get up
Don't wanna get up
Because of love (Because of love)

You compliment me
Not an accessory
You're necessary
You never could speak bad words against me
Your bare with me
Security
Are you here with me

Your my happiness
My joy (Joy)
And all because of you boy
I look forward to the time
I spend with you
Whatever it is we do

Cause I'm fallen for you boy
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Fallen
I've fallen for you
Fallen
Head over heels for you
So in love with you
Fallen
Love, oh
For you

Touch me (Touch me)
Hold me (Hold me)
Love me (Love me)
Kiss me
In love with you
Talk to me (Talk to me)
Caress me (Oh)
Play with me
Don't wanna get up
It's gonna be
Your my everything

[Chorus x3]
Fallen
Head over heels (To let you get away is crazy)
I've fallen
In love with you
I've fallen
And I can't get up (I won't get up)
Don't wanna get up (Don't wanna get up)
Because of love

And I can't get up (And I can't get up)
Don't wanna get up (Don't wanna get up)
Because of love
