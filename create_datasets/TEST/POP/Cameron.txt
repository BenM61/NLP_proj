Cameron's in drag, makes his father mad
Since he was a little boy he always felt more comfortable in lipstick
People call him fag, teachers turn their backs
Off the bus he runs and runs to get home before anyone can catch him

These days the world is full of aliens
The world is full of aliens
But you are a real, live human
Aren't you, Cameron?

Powder and a brush can cover any cuts
And quickly running cotton under cold water rinses out the blood marks
Cameron, you're a star
A light where there is dark
And you're a hundred times a woman
A hundred times the man that they are

These days the world is full of aliens
The world is full of aliens, but you are a human
A real, live human
Aren't you, Cameron?

You're not an alien
You're not an alien
You're not an alien
Cameron

You're not an alien
You're not an alien
You're not an alien
Cameron

Cameron's in drag, makes his father mad

These days the world is full of aliens
The world is full of aliens, but you are a human
You're not an alien
You are a real, live human
Aren't you, Cameron?
