I wrote a love song in sixteen bars
It says it all, it tells the truth.
This is my love song in sixteen bars
To tell the world that I'm really gone on you

I love you like the ocean loves the shore
Like flowers love the sun but even more
I love you like the heavens love the planets and the stars
There I've said it all in sixteen bars.

This is my love song in sixteen bars
To tell the world that I'm really gone on you

I promise you a thousand violins
A symphony of love that never ends
I promise you you'll always hear the sound of sweet guitars
There I've said it all in sixteen bars.

I wrote a love song in sixteen bars
It says it all, it tells the truth.
This is my love song in sixteen bars
To tell the world that I'm really gone on you
