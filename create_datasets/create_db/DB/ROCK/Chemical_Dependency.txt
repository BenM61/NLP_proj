[Solo: Rick]

Destruction is my goal
Care for no one at all
Death calls
I've killed before
And you won't be my last
That's for sure
Life of pain and I'm to blame
Broken families
Shattered dreams
All because of me
Can't you see
Blinded by the white
You can't see the light
Not tonight
Life of pain and I'm to blame
And now
I've got you hooked
Take another look
At yourself
Lost your home and pride
You can't win the fight
You're not too bright
Life of pain and I'm to blame
And you put to shame

[Chorus:]
Running scared no where to turn
I've got you now your going to burn
You've watched your life pass you by
The life you lead is one big lie

[Solo: Chris]
[Repeat verse]
