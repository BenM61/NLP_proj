You say, it's not so easy
You say, this life will tear us apart
Let's make some nights being easy
Pretend that it's a start

You say, you're lookin' for sweet lies
You say, tonight there's alot we can do
You got to learn to let go
Before it's killing you
Before it's killing you

You want the perfect moment
Make it last 'til the moment is gone
So much to run away from
You're not the only one

Hot light, spotlight, sweet lies, show time
Hot light, spotlight, sweet lies, show time
