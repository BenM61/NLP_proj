[Speak]
Cheri Dennis
J-O-C
I Love you Cheri

[Yung Joc]
Mama Mi amor I adore
Let Joc give you the world & more
Purchase the blue's it you's of course
Or we could vacate somewhere off shore
Or we could stay home tonight
Tops & pop we gonna get it right
Dim them lights be my snack in the middle of the night aight

[Verse 1]
See you at the corner
Corner of my eye
When you walking by
I get an appetite
Wanna take your picture
Wont u strike a pose
Turning them to up
Just wanna let u know

[Hook]
I think you're sexy
Baby wont u let me
Paint the perfect picture of us
Its so electric (yeah)
Something classic
Make it everlastin'
Its gonna be incredible
Priceless
It cant be sold

[Chorus]
Come & see the Portrait of Love (love, love, love)
This ain't the Mona Lisa
No Michaelangelo Picture
Come & see the Portrait of Love (love, love, love)
This ain't no history sculpture
Just a love getting closer (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
No need to be scared
Its not unusual to want somebody
More than physically
Oh no
You gotta play it fare
I promise that I'll be the only one
To blow your mind and get you there

[Hook]

[Chorus x2]

[Bridge]
The color of love
Is it red?
Or is it blue?
The creation of love
Beautiful and simply true (You you you)

[Gorilla Zoe]
Aight time 2 go
Wit a young O.G baby that be Zoe
U ain't gotta tell what ya man don't know
Lookin' at me baby wit ya eyes on gold
Spittin' no game I can see u chose
A young lil' playa
Chevrolet on 4's
Came by lost Cheri we both know
So we'll have a couple of drinks & some good convo
Yea

[Chorus]

No need to be scared
Its not unusual to want somebody
More than physically
Oh no
You gotta play fair
Oh so there
