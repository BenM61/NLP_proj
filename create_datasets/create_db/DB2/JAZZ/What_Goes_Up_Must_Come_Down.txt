You leave me alone, you don't even phone
You're carefree as a bird in the sky
But what goes up must come down
And, Baby, you've been flying too high

It's all over town, you're chasing around
But I'm not gonna sit home and cry
Remember what goes up must come down
And, Baby, you've been flying too high

You ought to get your walkin' papers
But now it's too late
Because I know you too well
When you're through cuttin' capers
You break down my gate
To ring my front door bell

So go have your fling, and don't miss a thing
I'll see you down to earth by and by
Remember what goes up must come down
And, Baby, you've been flying too high
