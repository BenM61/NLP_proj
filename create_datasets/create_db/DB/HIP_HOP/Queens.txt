turn off your swag
and check your vain
from your lengths to your tense
get down
but whatever you do
hey don't funk with my groove
whatever you do
don't funk with my groove
whatever you do
don't funk with my groove
whatever you do
don't funk with my groove
whatever you do
shake your cyber in your pocket
shake your cyber in your pocket
don't funk with my groove
whatever you do
shake your cyber in your pocket
shake your cyber in your pocket
don't funk with my groove
whatever you do
if this so good
like i knew it would
and if i could
i tell you what you should do
let me tell you what you should do
you .. make the flag .. in the world
it's kind of wag
move your groove..
to keep your soul and ..
whatever you do
hey don't funk with my groove
whatever you do
don't funk with my groove
whatever you do
don't funk with my groove
whatever you do
don't funk with my groove
whatever you do
turn off the swag
and check your..
turn off the swag
and check your..
turn off the swag
and check your..
turn off the swag
and check your..
sweat in your ..
the musicians
swept in your..physicians
