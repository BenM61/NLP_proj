It's just what all young lovers do
It's just what all young lovers do

I noticed you
You stood out like a sore thumb
The most
Beautiful sore thumb I'd ever seen
I took you out
And showed you a good time
We danced all night
And I waited till the time was right when
I was almost sick on you
Echo echo of mine

Do you recall
The night that we first met
And how I burnt your dress
With my cigarette
I don't know why
But I played this game
For you
I'm guessing it's just what all young lovers do

You say
That it's never wrong never right
Never wrong never right
Echo echo of mine

Never wrong never right
Never wrong never right
Never wrong never right
Never wrong never right
Never wrong never right
Never wrong never right
Never wrong never right
Never wrong never right

So echo on
Echo on
Echo on
Echo

It's just what all young lovers do
It's just what all young lovers do
It's just what all young lovers do
