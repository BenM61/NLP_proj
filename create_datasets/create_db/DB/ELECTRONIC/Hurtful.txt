I used to laugh it off
I used to look the other way
I used to save them troubles for another day
I kept my fingers crossed
I used to never take the blame
I'd pull a sunshine story in a pouring rain
The more I had to change I'd just stay the same

(The same, the same, I stayed the same)

You don't know what you got till you're missing it a lot
I had to go throw it away
I was wrong from the start from the bottom of my heart I apologize
What I did to you was hurtful
What I'm going through is hurtful

I used to buy my time
I used to beat around the bush
I'd rather give my ego another push
I used to be a fool
It was a foolish game I played
And it's a fool's faith coming mistakes I made
Once I had it right it was all too late

(Too late, too late, too little too late)

You don't know what you got until you're missing it a lot
I had to go throw it away
I was wrong from the start from the bottom of my heart I apologize
What I did to you was hurtful
What I'm going through is hurtful
What I'm going through is hurtful
It is hurtful
It's hurtful

Oh what I did to you
(What I did to you)

What I did to you was hurtful
What I'm going through is hurtful

I was wrong from the start from the bottom of my heart I apologize
What I did to you was hurtful
And what I'm going through is hurtful
