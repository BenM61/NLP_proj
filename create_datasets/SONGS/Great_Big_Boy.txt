I was 29 and it absolutely stank
I made a lot of friends and hung out at the bank
I bought a silly house on some very silly land
If anybody asked, I said this is who I am

Happy, contented, stuffed with dollar bills
I stood like a taxidermist's elk upon a hill

Suddenly I'm stupid and the world's too big for me
I hang my head and mumble my face between my knees
I find a little cave with a sign that says for rent
It looked a lot better than my place ever did

I found a way to live there so I am no-one's fool
When I look up I grin, when I look down I drool

I was 29 and it absolutely stank
I made a lot of friends and hung out at the bank
I bought a silly house on some very silly land
If anybody asked, I said this is who I am

I stood like a taxidermist's elk upon a hill
