Everyone played a different role

Baby they were born to be sold
They were born to be sold
They were born to be sold

Now all I know is all I see
And what I am I choose to be
I don't need no one to bleed for me
I'm gonna make my own history

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Here comes the news
Here comes the news
Baby, here comes the news, alright

I was born to be sold
All you hot shot, big buck
Sweet talking, side walking
Foot tapping, tail wagging
Back stabbing, money grabbing
Slaves of gold
I'm telling you, I don't need to be told
I cross my heart, rock my soul

Baby I was born to be sold
I was born to be sold
I was born to be sold
I was born to be sold
