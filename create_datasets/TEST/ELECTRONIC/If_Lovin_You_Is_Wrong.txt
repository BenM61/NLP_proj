Watch me ride:
I'm a sexual animal, eat you like a cannibal,
Crammed full of energy,
I'm inflammable,
Yeah, I finish my beer
So come here and get nice while I lick your ear,
Put your legs over there and kinda swing on the chair,
I swear you look wicked with your panties in your hair,
Eyes half closed,
Cute little nose,
And like a pound of self-raising I just rose and rose,
Stepped out of my clothes started doing the right thing,
I was pumping and she was biting,
Yeah, lightning flashed and thunder roared,
The girl had her finger on my keyboard,
Oh lord, this is gonna last all night,
If lovin' you is wrong I don't want to be right.
If lovin' you is wrong, I don't want to be right.
If I come first well that's the worse scenario,
I push you harder than Sanchez Vicario,
I mean it, 20th Century Fox on the screening,
One take like an earthquake make the bed brake,
We be famous worldwide overnight
And get tired of magazine articles we're forced to write.
I take a delight in making the bed springs sing all night,
If lovin' you is wrong I don't want to be right.
If lovin' you is wrong, I don't want to be right.
I give a massage,
Skin supercharge,
Imagination on turbo situation large,
Sometimes you handle me kinda course,
Like a horse, the bed a wrecked
To keep from flying.
I got my teeth in her neck...
If lovin' you is wrong, I don't want to be right.
If lovin' you is wrong, I don't want to be right.
If lovin' you is wrong, I don't want to be right.
If lovin' you is wrong, I don't want to be right.
If lovin' you is wrong, I don't want to be right.
If lovin' you is wrong, I don't want to be right.
