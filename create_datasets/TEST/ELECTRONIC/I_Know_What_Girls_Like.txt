Peep the scripts
Scope honey from the whips
Jumped out like yo!
Who the f*ck you with
Flash the jewels cause that's the rule
Damn I like a girl who spend a little cash for her shoes
Face natural, Can I get at you?
Saw a spot on the body look nice with a tattoo
With my name, but didn't want to jump the gun
I Didn't Know how many niggas was humping hon
I said I never seen a face like yours before
And I been around some cute whores before
That either me or my boys tore it up before
So I'm hoping you different
Let you push the 6
And give you a different life and
Baby if it's right jump on it in the morning
And ride it 'til the night
Want to buy you I'll jewelery when it hits the light
Bitches will momentarily lose they sight
She said

I know what boys like
I know what they want
I know what boys like, boys like
I know what boys like
I know what they want
I know what boys like, boys like me

So I'M a cutie with a booty like OW!
Deeper than the MOW!
Earrings Shine like,
I'm a real bitch so you know I do real things
Only real bitches live like queens, get it?
Safety deposit in the walk-in closet
Marvel fortress with matching Rolls Royce's
In the driveway from Monday to Friday
I be the richest, shitting on these bitches
While chickens cluck giving up the butt
I blaze the cut with the daddy raw buff
You can call me a slut
Who gives a f*ck
That's fine nigga shit
I'm a good with mine
I can tell by your shoes you know what I want
F*ck a prenup give me half up front
My sex be the best so we split these CARS
You can stop saying mine
And start saying ours

I know what girls like
I know what they want
They want to sex me
They think I'm sexy
I know what girls like, girls like me

I know what boys like
I know what they want
They want to sex me
They think I'm sexy
I know what boys like, boys like me

Got the bomb place, fireplace John Blaze
Victoria Secret lingerie
Ice like Don King
The price was like 8 digits a long way, shit
Got the beachfront view
V 1 2
Cop you one cop me one too
On the place, jet ski's parked by the lake
No neighbors, make all the noise you want to make
Invite your friends over
LET THEM make their way through
The Benz's and the Rovers before they reach the door
Vacay, away, a week or more
First class to and fro, freaking off
Got the Hamptons locked
Champagne popped
Cruise around the world 'til the damn thing stop
Cop rembrandt, handle, pay the lot
Can't complain, we balling, true or not?

I know what girls like
I know what they want
I know what girls like, girls like
I know what girls like
I know what they want
I know what girls like, girls like me
I know what girls like
I know what they want
I know what girls like, girls like
I know what girls like
I know what they want
I know what girls like, girls like me
