Sitting alone on a bench with you 
Mirrored above in the sky 
Wondering if you will say goodnight 
Leave me a grave and goodbye 

Night sky hangs in blackness 
Night threads, patterns weaving 
Somebody going tells you where I need me 
Casting gardens of shadow 
The lights flash, someone is driving 
Heat exchange, car on a highway going my way 

Sitting alone on a bench with you 
Talking 'bout your life and mine 
I find and bet you just don't like snakes 
They are just no friend of mine 

You've seen it all but you're foregoing 
You passed it by but you're not knowing 
You've heard it all before, you're going home 
You've seen them dying, now they're all alone 

Sitting alone on a bench with you 
Dipping my eyes in the stream 
Breath of your lips chases shadows away 
Clearing the mist from a tree 

Sitting alone on a bench with you 
Just as you get up to leave 
Holding my breath as I touch your hand 
Then with the brush of your sleeve 

Later in the morning 
Just as dawn starts snoring 

Sitting alone on an empty bench 
Mirrored above in the sky
