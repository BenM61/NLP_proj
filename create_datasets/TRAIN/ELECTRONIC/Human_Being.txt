She got me on a Monday
That's what I like to see
Got me on a Tuesday
That's what it's meant to be
Put me on a Wednesday
I would want to say
Married on a Thursday
Make another way
Swore me on Friday
She's gonna break your neck
Saturday comes around
She offed me on the deck
I thought I'd make it Sunday
But I didn't see it coming
And the stormies started humming
And my friends they started running

I only want to count the days
To say we made another day
Daytime seems to last so long
And that's for screaming live alone
Some piece of mind for the girl inside
Some little piece for the man who hides
Some piece of mind for the girl inside
Some little piece for the man who hides
We might just break can you hear us trying
We might just break can you see us crying
We might just break can you hear us trying
We might just break can you see us crying

I find it very hard
To say what I see
What's going through her mind
When she's looking the me
If all the things I've said right now
For both of us came true
Nobody would look for me
When I disappear in you
And it's never very clear just who's in control
It's all so beautiful what's the point of it all

I only want to count the days
To say we made another day
Daytime seems to last so long
And that's for screaming live alone
Some piece of mind for the girl inside
Some little piece for the man who hides
Some piece of mind for the girl inside
Some little piece for the man who hides
We might just break can you hear us trying
We might just break can you see us crying
We might just break can you hear us trying
We might just break can you see us crying
We might just break can you hear us trying
We might just break can you hear us trying
We might just break can you hear us trying
We might just break can you hear us trying
We might just break can you hear us trying
We might just break can you hear us trying
We might just break can you hear us trying
We might just break can you see us crying
