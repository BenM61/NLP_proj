Young people
Welcome to the... heaven... ... and ministry tonight
Won't you please turn in your hymnals to page 333
Sister Mildred, we're gonna play free at last
Free at last, thank God almighty 

Free at last, free at last
I thank God I'm free at last
Free at last, free at last
I thank God I'm free at last 

[Have you heard?]
[Listen carefully]
[I can't stop] 

(chorus 1)
Free, free, I'm free at last
Thank God Almighty I'm free at last
Free, free, I'm free at last
Thank God Almighty I'm free 

(chorus 2)
Cause I'm free, free at last
And I'm free, from my past, and I'm free
Free from sin, and I'm free
And I ain't going back again 

Shackles had me down but He gave me a new sound
So reclaim my name from the lost and found
Ya see, something's got me jumpin'
And I think it's the way
That He can take a hard man
And turn him into soft clay
Out of the darkness, the Father has sparked this
The spirit's alive while the flesh is a carcass
If you're seriously curious about my past
Well I once was lost but I'm free at last! 

(repeat choruses 1 and 2) 

Oppression was in session and my life was the term
But when I heard about the Word I was willing to learn
About a flavor I could savor and a brighter tomorrow
Cause this could never be endeavored by a wish on a star
The Father first receives us, the Truth then frees us
Forgiven, now I'm living like a man full of Jesus
It was hell until I fell upon my knees and prayed
But now the yoke that I was totin' has been taken away 

(repeat chorus 1) 

Cause I'm free, free at last, free
From my past, free from sin, and I'm free
And down on my knees when my life passed me by
And I ain't, no I ain't going back again 

F are to the E E
L A to the S T
Out of the darkness, the Father has sparked this
The spirit's alive while the flesh is a carcass
If you're seriously curious about my past
Well I was once lost but I'm free at last 

I'm here to tell you what he did for me and
I'm here to tell you that he set me free and
I know that He can do the same for you, too
He did it, I'm wit it, so come and get it
Be free at last! 

(repeat chorus 1 x2) 

When all of God's children: black men and white men,
Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics
Will be able to join hands and
Sing in the words of the old negro spiritual... 

(repeat chorus 1) 

Cause I'm free, free at last, cause I'm free
I'm free, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free
Down on my knees when my life passed me by
And I ain't, no I ain't going back again 
Thank God I'm free 

Free at last, free at last
Thank God almighty we are free at last!
