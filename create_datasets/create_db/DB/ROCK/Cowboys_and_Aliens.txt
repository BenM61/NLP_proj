Whirring, see the weird ship landing
Come to take us home with them
To a world of love
Do you want to come with us?

Fetch no net of safety
No armour no defences
We won't fight, we'll swish by
Stirring blood to rage

Gather the bruised and imperfected
The cursed and the rejected
We'll take them to our ship
We'll fly away from here
We'll take away our finery
Leave this place to rust.

The angles are bleeding
As they watch the thin-lipped shaking
Lost their nerve, we've gone too far
Yes we had to rage so hard

Gather the bruised and imperfected
The cursed and the rejected
We'll take them to our ship
We'll fly away from here

We're taking all our culture
Leave them all to rust
We're leaving ugly dust.
