My Decision your decision 
There's no common ground 
I'm sick and tired myself 
Don't wake me up Don't wave bye bye 

Don't jump inside my head this time 
I want to get through this day ah ah 
Slinging all those words around 
Drives my smile right to the ground 

I want to give it away 
You make it good but you make me 
Crazy  crazy  crazy  crazy  crazy 
Want to slap the world and slam it down 

Look at all the million people in the middle 
Of a golden steeple I am amazed 
Well it might be wrong but it may be right 
Look at us just passing time 

Don't let your love fall on down 
On my umbrella 
I'll say don't let your love fall on down 
On my umbrella yeah
Dig it! 

Running through a built in maze 
Ending up at the starting place 
I left behind ah ah 
Stop and try to catch my breath 
While I'm looking for my next step 
I slip away I slip away
You make it good 
But you make me 
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy 
Want to stop the world and slam it down 

Don't let your love fall on down on my umbrella 

I'll say You'll say. You'll throw it all away 
No! No! Go! No! I'm like a child 
And I'm lost for the first time you say 
Don't let your love fall down on my umbrella yeah
