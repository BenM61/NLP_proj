Go

You know it's hard

You know it's my gun

There's a killer on the street
She's moving from house to house
There's a murder over there
He's bleedin' from heart to mouth

One time where you're hiding's when she met ya
Two times she knows you won't forget her
Three times do anything to f*ck her
Last time ya dead before the morning

One time
Two times
