Eve and Adam's only child
Body that goes on for miles
Heaven only knows that real
Can be better than the fantasy
And her eyes shouldn't have
Blurred my vision I know that she, she

Was a beauty queen
And if you are gonna cry, don't cry for me
'cause from here on the ground
The truth I have found
Is we all fall down
Yes, we all fall down

Sidney told me something once
When he came and sat down next to me
He said, "Beware of the beautiful ones
Because they never let you rest in peace"
But her eyes shouldn't have blurred my vision
I know that she, oh, she

Was a beauty queen
And if you are gonna cry, don't cry for me
'cause from here on the ground
The truth I have found
Is we all fall down
Yes, we all fall down

Taken in, by the sweetest sin
Milk and honey tasting skin
'S why she always wins

She's a beauty queen
And if you were gonna cry, don't cry for me
'cause from here on the ground
The truth I have found

Is we all fall down
Yes, we all fall down
Yes, we all fall down
We can all fall down
