Gonna make you
Gonna make you
Gonna make you
All mine

Gonna love you
Gonna love you
Gonna love you
All the time

I want you more and more each day
And love to hear the things you say
I love to see the things you do
You turn me on, when I'm with you
I'm with you
I'm with you
I'm with you

Gonna make you
Gonna make you
Gonna make you
All mine

Oh no, baby

Gonna make you
Gonna make you
Gonna make you
All mine
Alright
