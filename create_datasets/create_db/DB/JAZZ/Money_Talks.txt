I don't care about your dreams of peace
I don't care about your please lord please
I don't care about your africa
I don't care about your ancestors

'Cause money talks and I'm listening to the sound
Money talks and it's the only sound that counts

I don't care about your truth to tell
I don't care about your heaven - hell
I don't care about your rock and roll
I don't care about your blues, jazz or soul

'Cause money talks and I'm listening to the sound
Money talks and it's the only sound that counts

Money talks and I'm listening to the sound
Money talks and it's the only sound that makes the world go round

I used to be like you, faithful and true
I used to lend my helping hand to my fellow man
Than one day it all broke up
That's the day when I woke up

I don't care about your other man
I don't care about your master plan
I don't care about your free the land
All I care is cash in hand

'Cause money talks and I'm listening

Money talks
Money talks
Money talks
