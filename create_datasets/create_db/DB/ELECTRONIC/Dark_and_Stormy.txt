When you're feeling dark and stormy
Lemme sing this song for you
In your room a forest grew
Walk through and lift your blues

Ah-ooh Ah-ooh
Ah-ooh I'd be for you
I say Ah-ooh Ah-ooh
Ah-ooh I'd be for you I'd be for you

I feel it spread out before me
Feel i could make you want me
When you hear me howlin boo
In your room a forest grew

Ah-ooh Ah-ooh
Ah-ooh I'd brake for you
I say Ah-ooh Ah-ooh
Ah-ooh I'd brake for you I'd brake for you

Well there's a look in her eye
Can I say, can I say, can I say

We made our own love
Nobody helps us
We'll make our own luck
Outrun the sadness
We made our own love
Nobody helped us
We'll make our own luck
Outrun the sadness

If you're feelings aren't a story
And your lamplight's ray is dim
I can offer you this organ
And a song we all must sing

Ah-ooh Ah-ooh
Ah-ooh I'd be for you
I say Ah-ooh Ah-ooh
Ah-ooh I'd be for you I'd be for you

We made our own love
Nobody helps us
We'll make our own luck
Outrun the sadness
We made our own love
Nobody helped us
We'll make our own luck
Outrun the sadness

We're not the same, but we're in time
Is there something on my back
Take a look, I'd like to see
Are we living with disease
