Arthur was born just a plain simple man
In a plain simple working class position
Though the world was hard and it's ways were set
He was young and he had so much ambition

All the way he was overtaken
By the people who make the big decisions
But he tried and he tried for a better life
And a way to improve his own condition

If only life were easy it would be such fun
Things would be more equal and be plenty for everyone
Arthur the world's gone and passed you by

Don't you know it, don't you know it
You can cry, cry all night but it won't make it right
Don't you know it, don't you know it

Arthur we know and we sympathize
Don't you know it, don't you know it
Arthur we like you and want to help you
Somebody loves you don't you know it

How is your life and your Shangri-La
And your long lost land of Hallelujah
And your hope and glory has passed you by
Can't you see what the world is doing to ya

And now we see your children
Sailing off in the setting sun
To a new horizon
Where there's plenty for everyone

Arthur, could be that the world was wrong
Don't you know it, don't you know it
Arthur, could be you were right all along
Don't you know it, I hope you know it

Now we know and we sympathize
We'd like to help you and understand you
Don't you know it, don't you know it
Somebody loves you, don't you know it
Don't you know it, don't you know it

Arthur the world's gone and passed you by
Don't you know it, don't you know it
You can cry, cry all night
But it won't make it right

Don't you know it, don't you know it
(Don't you know it, don't you know it)
