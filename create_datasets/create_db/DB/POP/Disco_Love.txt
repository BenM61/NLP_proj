Once my life was just a lonely room
With no one to take away my gloom
Waiting for someone to come and fill my life with love

Oh, sweet love 
And set my heart on fire, fire
Burning at the flame of love 
Higher, higher than the stars above
I need someone to drive me wilder, wilder than a
Raging  storm
Ooh, I need somebody to burn me at the flame of love 

Every cloud must have a silver lining
You came along my knight in armor shining
All my life I've been knocking at doors
Now I'm so glad that door that opened was yours
You set my heart on fire, fire
Burning at the flame of love 
Oh, you take me higher, higher than the stars above
You drive me, drive me, wilder, wilder than a
Raging storm 
Ohh pretty baby, I'm burning at the flame of love
Ohh pretty baby, I'm burning, burning with love
Ooh pretty baby, I'm burning at the flame of love 
Ooh pretty baby, I'm burning, burning with love
