If you from the BKs you flays nigga

VERSE ONE:
[Geechie Suede]
Now here we are star apport a sarsparilla
In the Don Ezetti on the Veric Express
We got the imperic and vino just for the keeper
And yes he be the Cheeba
And yes I be the Suede
So gimme zigga zigga
And we can get with Kiki
The seventh heaven cloud is for my coofie and Daichiki
So you see me on the upper
But it's always the Loer
We make it Hollywood 'cause diamond cooks is takin' over

[Sonny Cheeba]
And yes yes you to the BN
Scores like 10 on my IQ test
Stay live with Divine so I'm so funky fresh
I rocks to the east I flows to the west
Does Max Julien number one draft pick?
A finger to the wrist here we go for the Knicks
It's like that super phat catch a heart attack
Then smoke the Shooby Dooby with the black nostaljack

CHORUS 2x

VERSE TWO:
[Sonny Cheeba]
No not she I know it can't be
Hair so sweet how sweet can they be?
I rock around the clock then I end up on your block
I give the cat a smack to the rhythm tick tock
But who he? You know it only be the Sonny Chee
And who that? The king in Aerofin Geechie Suede
I ride up on a wave and pursue their gameplays
By Zemiah Jackson be there like she stole something, brah

[Geechie Suede]
Yo, she call me Portier
She had the Oreano stashed in the Hathaway
So know wew hipsiano to the Barry Cotto Height
And now we got the fuzz flash and crazy fucking lights
The diamond life is trife
But we can get this rotto so get riler with the glamour
We meet them in Aruba get the goods down in Savannah
You know it can't be them so it's got to be Loer
And we make it Hollywood 'cause diamond cooks is takin' over

CHORUS 2x

VERSE THREE:
[Geechie Suede]
One for the money two is for the Ebeneezer
We used to stick these cats for all they masses and they pieces
An we do it on our leisure
I keep away we seize her
I used to rock a bubblegoose wild child into the fever
Now we in the Estee Lauder
And Nina rich in sage
The microphone kimono with tequilla for my tempest
I said it once before and I'm sayin it all over
We make it Hollywood 'cause diamond cooks is takin' over

[Soony Cheeba]
Drop cats from BX on the one and the two
We sippin on the booze with the little big league shoe
Somebody pulled a heist but they just don't know who
I wonder how we do heist the juice how we do
I'm in the airy lye with a little bit of ooh
I do swing my flings but I practise kung fu
Now this here be the end so we will be seeimg you
Nigga come on
Nigga come on

CHORUS 3x

I get fly (you get fly) heads collect
BKs you flays south QB (you get fly)
Camp Lo in the mafi (you get fly)
Always move like that one time for y'all (you get fly)
Get fly
Get fly
The rhythm is all over you
The rhythm is all over you
The rhythm is all over you
The rhythm is all over you
