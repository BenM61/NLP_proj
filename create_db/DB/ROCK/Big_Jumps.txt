I walked all morning to lift my heart,
'Cause the world keeps dancing with the paper man.
I love you never talk in dreams,
But now it's here your happiness is real.

Oh make some big jumps, big jumps,
You're afraid to break some bones.
Come on make some big jumps, big jumps,
Life is yours alone.
You hold your head up, your head up high, like you think I do.

Sometimes I feel so confused,
I'm under the illusion that I have to choose.
I love you always know the way,
The way back home always is the same.

Oh make some big jumps, big jumps,
You're afraid to break some bones.
Come on make some big jumps, big jumps,
Life is yours alone.
You hold your head up, your head up high, like you think I do.

Tick-tock, this clockwork will stop,
You're the key for winding up my heart.
Brick-brack, if you don't wind me up,
The sky will lie upon me like a passed-out drunk.

Without you I would never rise again.
Without you I would never rise.

Hey there sunshine lift my heart,
I know life is long but it goes so fast.
I love you never feeling old,
You never bought the rubbish that they sold.

Oh make some big jumps, big jumps,
You're afraid to break some bones.
Come on make some big jumps, big jumps,
Life is yours alone.
You hold your head up, your head up high, like you think I do.

Oh make some big jumps, big jumps,
You're afraid to break some bones.
Come on make some big jumps, big jumps,
Life is yours alone.
You hold your head up, your head up high, like you think I do.
