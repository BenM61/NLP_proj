If I could believe
If I only could see another way
I would sail away

On ship with things 
From which to gaze
Across the waves 

But I'm without you
Through the heartland

We can be brave again
Stand up you fool
Forevermore - forevermore

If I only could see
If I did not deceive your shelter
I would build bridges with a care
We could kiss forever there

But I'm without you ...
Get on get up off the floor
Here it comes now 
Here it comes again
