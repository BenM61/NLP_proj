She moved in next door to me
And she showed me her world
What a neighbor, thanks for the favor
She's a very sexy girl

She's a sexy girl, sexy girl, sexy girl
She's a very sexy girl
She's a sexy girl, sexy girl, sexy girl
She's a very sexy girl

I got a feeling I can't go wrong
'Cause every time I see her
It's like hearing my favorite song
She's already down the steps,
She's way down the block
But my heart keeps beating faster,
And it just won't stop

She's a sexy girl, sexy girl, sexy girl
She's a very sexy girl
She's a sexy girl, sexy girl, sexy girl
She's a very sexy girl

I love to take her walkin'
And when we started talkin'
I'd tell her she's the finest I've ever seen
She'd look into my eyes,
But then I realize
I'm holding on to a dream

She's a sexy girl, sexy girl, sexy girl
She's a very sexy girl
She's a sexy girl, sexy girl, sexy girl
She's a very sexy girl

Stop any man walking down the street
Ask him what kind of girl he'd like to meet
There's not one thing in the whole wide world
He'd rather see than a sexy girl

She's a sexy girl, sexy girl, sexy girl
She's a very sexy girl
She's a sexy girl, sexy girl, sexy girl
She's a very sexy girl
