Saw the fire 
Saw you laughing at the crowd 
You were happy 
I was glad 

Drew your picture 
Drew your picture in the sand 
Felt your heart beat 
In my hand 

Felt the wind roar 
On the seashore 
I heard a voice calling calling 
In the half light 

Saw a strange light 
Up in the sky falling falling 

Just a picture 
Just a picture on the beach 
You were always 
Out of reach 

Saw the fire 
Saw the flames light up the sky 
Saw your picture 
Floating by 

Feel the wind roar 
On the seashore 
I heard a voice calling calling 
In the half light 

I saw a strange light 
Up in the sky falling falling
