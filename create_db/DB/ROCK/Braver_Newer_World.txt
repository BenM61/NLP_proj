Tell me now that you know how
To greet the dawn each day.
Fearless and unfettered, stand
Before the sun and pray.
There's no controversy
Let silence judge your plea
For justice or for mercy.
They both will set you free.

It's a braver, newer world you've found,
Rolling 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round
It's a braver, newer world you've found.
Show me know that you know how
To play the winning game.
Laughing 'til the sky stands still
With neither praise nor blame.
There's still time for heaven,
Though we're already there.
The daily bread will leaven
All hope, all pain, all care.

It's a braver, newer world you've found,
Rolling 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round.
It's a braver, newer world you've found.

Teach me now that you know how
To learn the learner's art.
Open with the master's myth
And play with all your heart.
Listen to your singing,
Love will be your voice.
The gift that you are bringing
Is all for all, your choice.

It's a braver, newer world you've found,
Rolling 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round.
It's a braver, newer world you've found.
