I am on a journey to discover what it's like
To be free of all my demons, to be free of all my demons

Contents on the counter, knocked out of their place
A late eighties biker bar, just doing its thing
The drugs from all our parents stuck inside our veins
I traded you for Vicodin, just doing my thing
I used to be a lawyer, now I just talk a lot
I'm the King of Allentown, this parking lot

I am on a journey, to discover what it's like
To be free of all my demons, to be free of all my demons
While it don't effect me, not like it used to
I am on a journey, to discover what it's like
To be free
