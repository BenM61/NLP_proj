The light, it flickers
Your light, traveling down so deep
Illumination

I have been cold, I have been blind
You have come to change my mind
I can put my faith in you

The light, it blisters
Your light, coming down so bright
Transformation
Turn it up, give me some room to grow
Turn it up, give me that sense to know

I have been cold, I have been blind
You were sent to change my mind
I can put my faith in you

For something ordinary
It's so extraordinary
I trust, I put my faith in you
In you
In you, in you
In you, in you

The light, it glitters
Your light, when I stand this close
It's almost blinding
Turn it up, give me some room to grow
Turn it up, give me the sense to know

I have been changed, I have become
I have flamed under the sun
I'm the reflection of you

For something ordinary
It's so extraordinary
I trust, I put my faith in you
In you
In you, in you
In you, in you
In you, you, you

For something ordinary
It's so extraordinary
I just, I put my faith in you
In you
In you, in you
In you, you, you

It flickers
It blisters
It glitters

In you, in you
In you, you, you
You are
