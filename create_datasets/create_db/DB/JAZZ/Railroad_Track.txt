Well everybody come along with me
I'll take you to a place you never did seen
You gotta rhythm with the two left feet
And a big man's band on a rolling street yeah, aw yeah

He's got a rhythm and it's all you need
So everybody come and rock your thing
Take you down to the early days 
When the champagne flow like a river stream yeah

Yeah 'cause I'ma go down on a railroad track 
And I ain't going back and no I ain't coming back
'Cause I'ma leaving town and I ain't coming back no more

So everybody come along with me
Go down the river and wash your feet
To where the people live a life that's sweet
And a place that's ripe with the jungle heat yeah

Yeah well I'ma go down on a railroad track 
And I ain't going back an' no I coming back
'Cause I'ma leaving town and I ain't coming back no more

Yeah 'cause I'ma go down on a railroad track 
And I ain't going back and no I ain't coming back
'Cause I'ma leaving town and I ain't coming back no more
