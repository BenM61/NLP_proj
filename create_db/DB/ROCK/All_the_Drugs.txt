The devil's driving my car tonight
And he's drunk
He's pissed, he's mad
I don't care which of you
He fucks up

I play with fire and
The matches they're
Cutting my hand

They can try
To shut me up
They never will
They never will again

With all the drugs
With all the drugs
With all the drugs in the world
You can't shut up that girl

And no one
Obliterate the truth
Cause there's no lie
That I could beat in you

With all the drugs
With all the drugs
But there's all the drugs in the world
But there's all the drugs in the world

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, yeah

With all, all of my money
With all, all of my love
With all, all of my money
Doesn't feel as good
As the drugs

With all the drugs in the world
You can't shut up that girl
With all the drugs in the world
With all the drugs in the world

Gonna make you every inch of you
Baby, I'll burn to chill the lights
You'll never ever ever f*ck like me
So baby why, why do you even try?
Oh yeah

Generation it has slipped away
Oh baby leave no trace of it behind
Steal the power of the powerful man
And baby leave here with me
Leave here tonight
