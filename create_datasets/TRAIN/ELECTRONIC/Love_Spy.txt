Day by day and night by night I'm sitting by the phone.
I am the famous love spy
Call me when you're alone.
Love spy
Love spy
He is so strong as all the world can see
He is a man
Oh
As all the boys wish they could be.
Love spy
Love spy
He is so strong as all the word can see
He is a man
Oh
As all the boys wish they could be
Yeah
The boys wish they could be.
I quickly jump into my car and leave some dust behind
I rush through New York City
I am the daring kind.
Love spy
Love spy
. . .
I'll keep away the gangsters
There's nothing they can do
And if you need protection I'll stay the whole night through.
Love spy
Love spy
. . .
Love spy
Love spy
