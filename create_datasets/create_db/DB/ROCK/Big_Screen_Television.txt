Big screen television
Say no more
Switch it on and I'll see you in hell
We got the good seats
Just look at the smiles on our faces
Right now (x2)
We are the luckiest people in the whole wide world
Whole wide world (x2)
Big screen tv
In a glass house
Wanna lay down next to you and sleep
But are you dreaming?
Are you dreaming? (x3)
Look at you tracing circles in the grass
Getting bigger and bigger and over and out
We're almost ready to leave
To follow the weather and go where the colour goes
Send a message to the birds that sing in the trees
Always awake before me and always louder than tv
