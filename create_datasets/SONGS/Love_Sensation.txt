Don't go changing, rearranging
Don't go changing, rearranging
Hold on to a love sensation
If you ever go away
That would be my darkest day

We've been drawn together by love's chemistry
I was born to be by your side sure as the river meets the sea
We've only known each other for a little while, but you're my destiny

I would move all heaven and earth just to set you free
In lover's liberty, inject the chemistry
That's gonna move you, never gonna loose you

Don't go changing, rearranging
Hold on to a love sensation
If you ever go away
That would be my darkest day

Lately I've been seeing a little doubt in your eyes
You used to call me everyday to say the things to keep me satisfied

I would move all heaven and earth just to set you free
In lover's liberty, inject the chemistry
That's gonna move you, never gonna loose you

Don't go changing, rearranging
Hold on to a love sensation
If you ever go away
That would be my darkest day
Don't go changing, rearranging
Hold on to a love sensation
That's a power energy that only flows from you to me

I would move all heaven and earth just to set you free
In lover's liberty, inject the chemistry
That's gonna move you, never gonna loose you

Don't go changing, rearranging
Hold on to a love sensation
If you ever go away
That would be my darkest day
Don't go changing, rearranging
Hold on to a love sensation
That's a power energy that only flows from you to me
Don't go changing, rearranging
Hold on to a love sensation
If you ever go away
That would be my darkest day
