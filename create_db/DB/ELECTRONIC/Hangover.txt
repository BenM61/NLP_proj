I got a hangover, whoa! I've been drinking too much for sure
I got a hangover, whoa! I got an empty cup pour me some more

So I can go until they close up, eh
And I can drink until I'm tore up, eh
And I don't ever ever want to grow up, eh
I wanna keep it going, keep keep, keep it going (going)

I got a little bit trashed last night, night
I got a little bit wasted, yeah yeah
I got a little bit mashed last night, night
I got a little sh' faceded, yeah yeah

Oh oh oh oh oh, I'm on the roof
Oh oh oh oh oh, if you don't know
Oh oh oh oh oh, well now you know

I got a hangover, whoa! I've been drinking too much for sure
I got a hangover, whoa! I got an empty cup pour me some more

So I can go until they close up, eh
And I can drink until I'm tore up, eh
And I don't ever ever want to grow up, eh
I wanna keep it going, keep keep, keep it going, come on!

Drink up, cause a party ain't a party 'til you ride all threw it.
End up on the floor, can't remember you clueless.
Officer like what the hell is you doin'
Stopping it, trouble it, you know you know what? come again
Give me (gimme) Henn, give me (gimme) gin, give me (gimme) champagne bubbles til' the end
What happens after that, if you inspired til I'm ten
Like oh my homie Taio, we can all sip again again and again
Wasted so what, irrelevant we're kicked to the head, who's selling it
I got the hangover , that's my medicine
Don't mean like I said, I'm too intelligent
A little jack can't hurt this veteran
I show up but I never throw up, so let the drinks go up, pour up

I got a hangover, whoa! I've been drinking too much for sure
I got a hangover, whoa! I got an empty cup pour me some more

So I can go until they close up, eh
And I can drink until I'm tore up, eh
And I don't ever ever want to grow up, eh
I wanna keep it going, keep keep, keep it going, come on!

I got a hangover, whoa! I've been drinking too much for sure
I got a hangover, whoa! I got an empty cup pour me some more

So I can go until they close up, eh
And I can drink until I'm tore up, eh
And I don't ever ever want to grow up, eh
I wanna keep it going, keep keep, keep it going, come on!
