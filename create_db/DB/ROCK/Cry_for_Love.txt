Status seekers, I never cared
Once I found out they never dared
To seize the world and shake it upside down
And every stinking bum should wear a crown

Sayin' I cry for love
Till all the plates are broken
Cry for love
Until my eyes are soakin', yeah
Cry for love
On every salmon morning, yeah I
Cry for love
'Cause imitation's boring, cry for love
Cry for love, cry for love

Bad tv that insults me freely
Still, I know what I'm dyin' to see
In searching for a meaningful embrace
Sometimes my self-respect took second place

And I cried for love
I did what my heart told me
Cried for love
Can't stand it when they scold me, yeah I
Cried for love
On every salmon morning, yeah I
Cry for love
'Cause imitation's boring, cry for love
Cry for love, cry for love, cry for love

Surfers ride for love and wipe out when it hits 'em
Soldiers kill for love and nobody admits it
If you're cryin' for love, well, that's ok don't sweat it
If you're cryin' for love then there's still a chance you'll get it, cry for love
Cry for love, cry for love
Cry for love
