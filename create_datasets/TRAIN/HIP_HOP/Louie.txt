Ah OK Bro

One thing bout me, yeah I got swag
The way I count it up and throw it in my Louie bag
It's in my Louie bag, yea its in my Louie bag
It's in my Louie bag, yea its in my Louie bag

(Blood Raw)
One thing bout raw, raw got swag
Raw hit the mall and I don't pop tags
Raw stay clean, raw stay fresh
You know those must be 87's in them jeans (i guess)
I Bought 'em in Miami ship 'em hoes up to Duval
Must of had 20 chicken-heads up in that u-haul
I move so smooth, cause them jack boys back track
Half a quarter mill in the brown Louie nap-sack

One thing bout me, yeah I got swag
The way I count it up and throw it in my Louie bag
It's in my Louie bag, yea its in my Louie bag
It's in my Louie bag, yea its in my Louie bag

Now these sant pata, cost me a lot of
Pasta spaghetti's you can send 'em we ready!
Same color as huaraches, countin' the karate
Make the doors spin around and round house somebody
Shoes by Louie, sippin' on Louie
Look I cant even lie all my bitches know I'm Louie
One thing about young, young swag with it
The only nigga in the drought with a 19 ticket, lets get it

One thing bout me, yeah I got swag
The way I count it up and throw it in my Louie bag
It's in my Louie bag, yea its in my Louie bag
It's in my Louie bag, yea its in my Louie bag
