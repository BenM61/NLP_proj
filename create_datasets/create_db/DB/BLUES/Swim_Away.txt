I've forgotten why I'm living 
Shoulda tied a string around my finger 
And I've forgotten what the point is 
What to do, don't know ooh 

Daylight crashes on my window 
Is it really time to get up again? 
I have only started dreamin' 
And I don't think I can get outa bed 

There's a sweet man I am lovin' 
But I just can't, I just can't make it right 
And when I wake up in the mornin' 
I am blinded and I just can't stand the light 

I've forgotten why I'm livin' 
Shoulda tied a string around my finger 
And it's about time to be leavin' 
But I don't know, I don't know where to go
