With your glitter bandanna and your Sammy Hagar T-shirt, you're every trucker's dream. 
And heaven is ridin' around with the T-tops out, B.T.O. and ole Jim Beam. 
It's 2 a.m., the bars all closed, but the night's not over yet. Wastin' time with racist remarks, coffee and cigarettes.

Gonna hang out, gonna hang out
Hangin' out at the Cadillac Inn
Gonna hang out, gonna hang out
Hangin' out at the Cadillac Inn

I remember you back in high school, you were such a sight, 
Then I saw you at the Ted Nugent show, you got kicked out for starting a fight.
Puttin' lids on at the Ragu plant keeps you busy 9 to 5
Braggin read loud with your chainsaw voice about your boyfriend's engine size.
