Get me outta here
Cuz my eyes are burning
From these silly tears
That you brought when you show me you don?t really care
And you never loved me, someone get me outta this place
Right now

It's so amazing how you have so many faces
And you are not that person I thought that
I had fell so deep in love with

You changed up your makeup your DNA
I can?t recognize you?re a stranger to me
I feel so betrayed what a waste of my heart and me

Get me outta here
Cuz my eyes are burning
From these silly tears
That you brought when you show me you don?t really care
And you never loved me, someone get me outta this place
Right now

My body's trembling it's so damn hard
To kick this feeling, your heart is so cold and now I'm freezing
Wish you could feel the pain, maybe I will arrange it
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

You changed up your makeup your DNA
I can?t recognize, you?re a stranger to me
I feel so betrayed, what a waste of my heart and me

Get me outta here
Cuz my eyes are burning
From these silly tears
That you brought when you show me you don't really care
And you never loved me, someone get me outta this place

I thought that we were forever
I guess I misunderstood
My fault for thinking you loved me
Or in thinking you ever could
Get me out of here right now
Get me out of here right now

Get me outta here
Cuz my eyes are burning
From these silly tears
That you brought when you show me you don't really care
And you never loved me, someone get me outta this place

Get me outta here
Cuz my eyes are burning
From these silly tears
That you brought when you show me you don't really care
(You don't really care)
And you never loved me, someone get me outta this place

1,2,3,4
Right now, right now, right now
Someone get me outta this place
Get me outta here
