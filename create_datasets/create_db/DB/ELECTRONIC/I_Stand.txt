I stand ! I'm not about to lose !
I'm turning into something new
I just stand against your bible
Don't believe that's what we choose
I know you think you're unbreakable
It seems that you de-fine the rules
I wanna escape but I'm unable
We got to Stand ! We got nothing to lose
All I share
Might be there
But I'll change my ways
I just stand against your idol
And I don't need your point of view
I will fight for my survival

I don't believe you teach the truth !
Something's calling me from inside
Says I shouldn't put my trust in you
And I can see what you're trying to do
And I will Stand ! You're not so hard to lose
All I share
Might be there
But I'll change my way
I've got a feeling that makes me rise
And I will fight to see the lies
I know I'm gonna be standing on my own
But I don't fear my life alone NO !
I don't fear my life alone.
