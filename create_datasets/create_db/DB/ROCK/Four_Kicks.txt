Huff men don't take no nonsense
He's here to rectify
He's got his black belt buckle
And the red mans fire in his eyes

You with your switchblade posse
I'll get my guns from the south
We'll take to the yard like a cock fight
For kicks, who's struttin' now?

This party's overrated
But there ain't shit else to do
She's a lovin' on the boy from the city
I'll be lovin' him under my shoe

You with your switchblade posse
I'll get my guns from the south
We'll take to the yard like a cock fight
For kicks, who's struttin' now?
