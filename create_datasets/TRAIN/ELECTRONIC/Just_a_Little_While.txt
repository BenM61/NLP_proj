Baby I like it when it feels this good
You always seem to make me smile
Can't nobody do what you do
When you love me just a little while

I, I know you got somewhere to go
And I've got somewhere to be right now
We can wait all day long
If you want to get a little while

I don't want to be a distraction to you
No no no 
So maybe I'll just lay around
Play by myself
Or touch in all my favorite fruit

Can't stop thinkin' bout the things we do
Or how it feels makin' love to you
I'm ready to get it baby
If you've got it to dish out
Just love me for a little while

I want to make it like a dream for you
Turn every fantasy into the truth
Ya know, 
I'll take it anywhere 
That you want to go right now
Just love me for a little while

I, I like sleeping in your clothes
The smell makes it all come down
When I think about me and you
Sometimes I get a little wild

Baby, I know we did it all night long
And I didn't want to burn you out
Cause you know how much I like to
Do it in the morning, it's another while

I don't know if you have other things to do
No no no
So maybe I'll just lay around, play by myself
Or touch in all my favorite fruit

Can't stop thinkin' bout the things we do
Or how it feels makin' love to you
I'm ready to get it baby
If you've got it to dish out
Just love me for a little while

I want to make it like a dream for you
Turn every fantasy into the truth
Ya know, 
I'll take it anywhere 
That you want to go right now
Just love me for a little while

My passion flows like a river has no end
I want to know everything
Ya let me do to you
(Tell me what you like baby)
(You want to play with my strawberries)
(Sometimes when I think about me and you, 
I get real wild)

Can't stop thinkin' bout the things we do
Or how it feels makin' love to you
I'm ready to get it baby
If you've got it to dish out
Just love me for a little while

I want to make it like a dream for you
Turn every fantasy into the truth
Ya know, 
I'll take it anywhere 
That you want to go right now
Just love me for a little while

Just love me 
Just love me for a little while
I'll take you anywhere
Just love me for a little while
Just love me for a little while
Tell me everything you'll let me do to you
Just love me for a little while
