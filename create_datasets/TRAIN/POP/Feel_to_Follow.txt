How was I to ever,
Believe it?
It's never too late,
Until it's too late,
And I've been stranded,
And I need something.

Now I can see it,
And I can feel it,
I believe it.
Ever since I,
Can remember,
It's been as nothing.

Until I almost,
Feel to follow.

Feel to follow.

How will I ever,
Get a breather,
When it's over?
I've seen it in another,
Someone stronger,
Couldn't leave it.

Until I almost,
Feel To Follow

Feel to follow
