She said she likes my watch
But she wants Steve's AP
And she stay up all hours watching Q.V.C.
She said she loves my songs
She bought my mp3
And so I put her number in my bold B.B.

I got a black B.M.
She got a white T.T.
She wanna' see whats hiding in my CK briefs
I tell her, wear suspenders
And some PVC
And the I'll film it all up on my J.V.C.

Scene one
Everybody get in your positions
Pay attention, and listen
We're tryna get this all in one take
So let's try make that happen
Take one
Action

She pulls for F.H.M.
She like my black L.V.
We spilling Lpr up on my A.P.C.
I'm in my P.R.P.
Ass in my Nike SBs
Raving with S.H.M. London to N.Y.C.

I got my visa and my visa
A diva and her dealer,
Bitch I'm up on the guest list
With the Swedish house mafia
You can find me on a table
Full of vodka and tequila
Surrounded by some bunnies and
It ain't fucking Easter

I'll wake up in the morning with a
Mild case of amnesia
With a girl that like a girl
Like Lindsay Lohan and Queen Latifa
If you, love balling then
Boy I must be FIFA and that's standard
Procedure from Miami to Ibiza

Yeah
From Miami to Ibiza
Yeah
From Miami to Ibiza
