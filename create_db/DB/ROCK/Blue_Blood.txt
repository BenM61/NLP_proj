You've got the blood on your hands, I think it's my own.
We can go down to the streets and follow the shores.
Of all the people, we could be two.
Then I bite my nails to the quick, run back home.

You've got blue blood on your hands, I know it's my own.
You came at me in the midnight to show me my soul.
Of all the people, I hoped it'd be you.
To come and free me, take me away.
To show me my home.
Where I was born.
Where I belong.

You've got blue blood on your hands, I want you to know.
I hoped you'd come and take me away, back to my home.
Of all the people, it had to be you.
Then I bite my nails to the quick, run back home.

You showed me.
Where to go.
To my home.
To my home.
So take me.
Through the roads.
That you know.
To my home.

You've got blue blood on your hands, I know it's my own.
You came at me in the midnight to show me my soul.

You showed me.
Where to go.
To my home.
To my home.
So take me.
Through the roads.
That you know.
To my home.

Come with me accept it, affect it, protect it.
Come with me accept it, so now you know.
Come with me accept it, effect it, protect it.
Come with me accept it, so now you know.

You showed me.
Where to go.
To my home.
To my home.
So take me.
Through the roads.
That you know.
Where you know.
Where you know.
To my home.
So take me.
Through the roads.
That you know.
Where you know.
You showed me.
Where to go.
To my home.

(Come with me accept it, affect it, protect it.
Come with me accept it, so now you know).
(Come with me accept it, effect it, protect it.
Come with me accept it, so now you know).

You've got blue blood on your hands, I know it's my own.
We can go down to the streets and follow the shores.
Of all the people, I hoped it'd be you.
You showed me my way back home.
To where I was born.
Where I belong.
Where I belong.
