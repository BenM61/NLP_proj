It's always something isn't it, always something,
Never the one thing that you'd grown use to
So you rush to find that influence that will bridge the divide,
Nobody left you a guide your protection's down, you're open wide

Never mind, never mind, never mind
Don't they say that's always the way
You better learn to play, that's always the way

Hapless custodian of what's too lovely to describe,
You better find someplace to hid,
What's too precious to mention
No you don't know what to do with all that painful stuff you feel,
Sometimes forgotten but all to real,
When what's concealed become revealed

Never mind, never mind, never mind
Don't they say that's always the way
You better learn to pray, that's always the way
 
You never did learn to sit before,
And simply know the score,
Know the undertone,
Or to lay, or to lay, or to lay me down by the still waters

Broken yet luminous
Like a thousand shards of light,
Or more numerous than the stars at night,
Waiting for some mystic union,
Oh yes it's holy work, but is it too hard a road to hoe?
A prize, or a scary place to go?
To be discovered, or remained unknown

Never mind, never mind, never mind
Don't they say that's always the way
Never mind, never mind, never mind
Don't they say that's always the way
You better learn to pray
