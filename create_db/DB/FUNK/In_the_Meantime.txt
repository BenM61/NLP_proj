You say 'Replay, run it back and forth'
But I'm nothing like the girl you knew before
I told you I'd be fine on my own
And I can't promise to stay
But the words I meant to say were 'I need you'
And I want to make it right
If not for life, just for tonight

In the meantime
We'll look out for the signs
Hold your heart close to mine
And for right now we'll just be
Watch and see

Round and round and upside down again
Nowadays he seems a different man
He told me he was making other plans
And couldn't promise to stay
But what he really meant to say was 'I love you'
And he wants to make it right
If not for life, just for tonight

In the meantime
We'll look out for the signs
Hold your heart close to mine
And for right now we'll just be
Watch and see

Light on the window says we should be going
One more glance and we'll be on our way
Light on the window says we should get going
One more dance and we'll be on our way
Light on the window says we should be going
Come down, sit now, let's talk about our love
