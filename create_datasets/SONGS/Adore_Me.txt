Bobbie's running naked through the woods again
And no one told her this was just a trick
Bobbie's running naked through the woods again
Or else we said your mother will get sick

You know you're here just to adore me,yeah
Don't you know you're here just to adore me
Yeah

Bobbie's running naked through the woods again
Or else we said your mother will be dead
Bobbie's running naked through the woods again
So scared of all the good things that she said

Knock knock knock knock knock knocking
Knock knock knock knock knock shocking

Bobbie's running barefoot over firewood
She says it's all about being alive
Bobbie's running barefoot over firewood
She tends to know the minute to arrive

You were here before me
Your job to adore me
I'm here for a reason
You're just for the season
You can be my master
To avoid disaster
I will bring my needle just in case
