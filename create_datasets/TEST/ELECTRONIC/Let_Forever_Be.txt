And how does it feel like to wake up in the sun,
And how does it feel like to shine on everyone,
How does it feel like to let forever be,
And how does it feel like to spend a little lifetime
Sitting in the gutter screaming symphony 

How does it feel like to sail in on the breeze,
And how does it feel like to spend a little lifetime
Sitting in the gutter screaming symphony 

And how does it feel like to make it happening,
And how does it feel like to breath with everything,
And how does it feel like to let forever be,
And how does it feel like to spend a little lifetime
Sitting in the gutter screaming symphony 

And how does it feel like to to be a Christian being
And how does it feel like to spend a little lifetime
Sitting in the gutter screaming symphony
