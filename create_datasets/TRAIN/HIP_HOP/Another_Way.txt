Early in the mornin' 'round 3 a.m.
Lyin' with a girl named Kim
With a glass of gin, sippin' on it
'Bout to hit the skins, now I'm all in
Telephone ring, was a girl named Jane
From around the way
How could I forget, down in my car
"Is it time to quit," runnin' through my head
I ain't tryin' to run around no more
Sick and tired of losin' track of score
Every time I turn around
The same old game another day
Thinkin' I just want to settle down
Tired of livin' foul, it's over now
Said to myself
"There's got to be another way"
Later in the day, next day
This was a girl named Trace
Drinkin' ???, spreadin' her legs
Drinkin' ???, callin' my name
Telephone rings she said that
It was a friend on the other end
Sound masculine, couldn't believe
How could I pretend, didn't hurt me
Finally I can see
There's another life for me
I don't want to live this way
I feel it's time I made a change
I believe I can be (Ho...ho...ho...)
A better man and I don't need
Every woman in the world
I gotta find myself a girl
I ain't tryin' to run around no more
Sick and tired of losin' track of score
Every time I turn around
The same old game another day
Thinkin' I just want to settle down (Mmm, hmm)
Tired of livin' foul, it's over now
Said to myself
"There's got to be another way" (Gotta be another way)
I ain't tryin' to run around no more
Sick and tired of losin' track of score (Mmm, I really believe)
Every time I turn around
The same old game another day
Thinkin' I just want to settle down (The same old game)
Tired of livin' foul, it's over now (Same old game)
Said to myself
"There's got to be another way" (I believe there's got to be another way
for me)
Got to be another way
Got to be another way, yeah...yeah...yeah...uh-huh, yeah
Mmm, hmm, oh, yeah
There's got to be another way
Another way, another way
I ain't tryin' to run around no more (Oh)
Sick and tired of losin' track of score
Every time I turn around (Every time I turn around)
The same old game another day (I see the same old thing)
Thinkin' I just want to settle down
Tired of livin' foul, it's over now (People playin' the same old game)
Said to myself (And I don't need it anymore)
"There's got to be another way" (I need to find another way)
I ain't tryin' to run around no more (Another way)
Sick and tired of losin' track of score (Another way)
Every time I turn around (Another way)
The same old game another day (No other way)
Thinkin' I just want to settle down (No other way)
Tired of livin' foul, it's over now (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Said to myself
"There's got to be another way"
