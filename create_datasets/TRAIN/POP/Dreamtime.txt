I saw you standing and I felt your rage
like a dark cloud on a crowded stage
You were talking through the smoke in your fantasy
I know you girl I know what to believe 

Maybe things ain't been so good at home
And the people that you love never cared at all
You want to run away don't care where you go
You want to run away that's all you know
Believe it's alright to fantasize
And say the words you think will satisfy me
But you know better than that
'Cause you know what's a lie 

You're living in Dreamtime Baby
It's time to wake up
You're living in Dreamtime Baby
It's time to shape up 

In your dream it's overcast
Rain comes down movin' your way fast
You want to run away don't care where you go
You want to run away that's all you know
Turn a corner then you see a door
Walk on through throw yourself on the floor
When you're looking up it's no surprise
Standing there is a man with Movie Star Eyes
Think he's gonna take care of you
The man with the plan that'll see you through
I say there ain't no way
'Cause I know he's a lie 

You're living in Dreamtime Baby
It's time to wake up
You're living in Dreamtime Baby
It's time to shape up 

I never saw anybody fall apart so fast
Living in Dreamtime you know it ain't gonna last
Never saw anybody think she's so right and be so wrong
Living in Dreamtime
It's hard to carry on
