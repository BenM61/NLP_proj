Take a little time to get to know me 
The night is open don't you feel the same as I 
'Cause I can do everything 
A heartbreak stroll with someone special 
The L.A. lights will never be the same 
Tonight I kill those memories 

Get it all now cause I'm on the prowl 
Come on baby right now 
Get it all straight cause you're whistle bait 
Come on baby right now 
Come on baby right now 

Feel the earth move when you're shaking that thing 
Hard to be around when you got nothing to gain 
I gotta go home and sleep it off
