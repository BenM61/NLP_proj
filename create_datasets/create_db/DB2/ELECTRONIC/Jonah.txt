She's a lady you'll remember
Wrapped in mystery and style
She's just one of love's pretenders
On her heart you can't rely

When she's dressed to kill, have you the strength of will, to turn away
Don't you hunger boy, for she's no toy, or soon you'll pay

Sarah, Sarah, my misfortune never looked so sweet
Just like Jonah, You bring me stormy seas with your deceit.

Now her charm just overwhelms me
Is my heart already sold!
I think of what my father told me
All that glitters is not gold

I'm in a cold, cold sweat and the more I fret, my fever will rise
It's a 'No Go Slow', I must leave this show before I'm her prize.

Sarah, Sarah, my misfortune never looked so sweet
Just like Jonah, you bring me stormy seas with your deceit.

You know I should be wise, I've seen through her disguise
She'll bring me stormy seas just like Jonah
You know I'm hooked on dreams, on all that may have been
She'll bring me stormy seas, just like Jonah.

Sarah, Sarah, my misfortune never looked so sweet
Just like Jonah, you bring me stormy seas with your deceit.

Jonah, Jonah, just like Jonah
Jonah, Jonah, just like Jonah.

Jonah tried to sail away,
Ah, ah, Jonah
Catch that boat to a brighter day, remember Jonah
Don't mock the Lord, don't take his word in vain
For Sarah, judgment day will come again.

Jonah rode those stormy seas, ah, ah, Jonah
For the Lord above he would not please, remember Jonah.

Jonah was swallowed by the whale, ah, ah, Jonah
He was soon to pray when he knew he'd failed.
