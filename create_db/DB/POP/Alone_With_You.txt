The night
Relieves the day
When the night
Relieves the day

You fill my days with laughter
You take away the strain
There's a smile I'd forgotten
But, you've put it there again

No I don't wanna lose you
Never wanna see you cry
I don't wanna lose you child
I'll never say goodbye

All I need is to be with you
Somewhere, somewhere we call home

Now you said that I hurt you
And left you far behind
But you knew I'd come running
I just hope that I'm in time

No I don't wanna lose you
Never wanna see you cry
I don't wanna lose you child
I'll never say goodbye

All I need is to be with you
Somewhere, somewhere we call home

No I don't wanna lose you
Never wanna see you cry
I don't wanna lose you child
I'll never say goodbye

All I need is to be with you
Somewhere, somewhere we call home
