There's a rising on the street tonight,
Every woman, man, and child,
Through the struggle we will all unite,
Watch the cities running wild.

'Cause we've been lied to by the liars,
We've been sold what we can buy
In our hearts there's a fire,
You can see it in our eyes.

We are the revolution, we want it all tonight,
We want to take back what's rightly ours

We are the revolution, we wanna stand and fight
Map of our lives, written in scars
Written in scars

There's a riot on the streets tonight,
There's a reason for the cause
It's up to us to remember,
All the world for coming forth, forth, forth

But I'll be taken by the taker,
A fate that awaits us all,
'Till the day we'll meet our Maker,
We won't be stopped by anyone.

We are the revolution, we want it all tonight,
We want to take back what's rightly ours

We are the revolution, we wanna stand and fight
Map of our lives, written in scars
Written in scars

We are the revolution, we want it all tonight
We want to take back what's rightly ours

We are the revolution, we wanna stand and fight
Map of our lives, written in scars
Written in scars

We are the revolution, we are the revolution, we are the revolution
