I start out you're in a daze and people start younger
In a thousand days and it's getting overexposed
Then someone asks, "How do you sleep at night?"
With the borrowed dreams from a broken past

You keep runnin' away don't matter how fast
or long you always wind up there
Another thousand pileups in the ugly name of morality
Fucking ugly, some creepy guy keeps asking

"How the f*ck do you sleep at night?"
With a frozen dream and a borrowed hope that died
Filth pig, filth pig
I sleep with both eyes open

Filth pig, filth pig
I keep chasing this tail but the tail gets bigger go figure
A thousand... keep the fires and flames alive
So how the f*ck do I dream at night?

With the memories of a borrowed death, the guilty tide
Filth pig, filth pig
He sleeps with both eyes open
Filth pig, filth pig

He sleeps all right because he's a
Filth pig
