Woke up in the evening 
To the sound of screaming 
Through the walls it was bleeding 
All over me 

Untied and weightless 
Unconscious as we cross 
The international dateline 
Let's end it here 

Grown tired of the show-coast
And then as we toast
There are all zeros 
Around here 

Untied and weightless 
Unconscious as we cross 
The international dateline 
Let's end it here 

Let's end it here 
Let's end it here 
Let's leave it here 
Let's leave it here 

Woke up in the evening 
To the sound of screaming 
Through the walls it was bleeding 
All over me 

Untied and weightless 
Unconscious as we cross 
The international dateline 
Let's end it here 

Let's end it here 
Let's end it here 
Let's leave it here 
Let's leave it here
