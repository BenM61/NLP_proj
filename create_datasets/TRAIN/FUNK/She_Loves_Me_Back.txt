I had a lover
Who did not love me back
I did everything that a guy could do
I couldn't do more than that
I felt so helpless
I thought things would never change
Then I saw my girl
Walking down on the avenue one day
I said, I wanna talk to you

I wasn't afraid to cry
Emotion was in my eyes
She took me on a natural high
When I said, I love you girl of mine
And then she said, "I love you back"
She loves me back (yeah yeah, well well)
She loves me back (yeah yeah, well well)
Yeah yeah (Yeah yeah, well well)

I had a lover
Who did not love me back
I bought her candy canes and dolls and flowers
And I took her to coney Island
Now, who could do more than that? 
It was a problem
Until on that fateful day
I saw my girl walking down on the avenue
And she said, "hei, come here, I wanna talk to you"

She wasn't afraid to cry
Emotion was in her eyes
She took me on a natural high
I said, "I love you girl of mine"
And then she said, "I love you back"
She loves me back (yeah yeah, well well)
(Yeah yeah, well well)
(Yeah yeah, well well)
Yeah yeah (yeah yeah, well well)

I don't think our love's gonna lose
There ain't no way
I'm taking my time to convince her
That love's here to stay, hey
Love is here to stay because
She loves me back
(Yeah yeah, well well)
She loves me back (Yeah yeah, well well)
What a pretty little girl (yeah yeah, well well)
What a pretty, what a pretty little girl (yeah yeah, well well)

When I told my girl I love her
She says, "I love you back"
She loves me back (yeah yeah, well well)

I told my girl I love her
She says, "I love you back"
She loves me back (yeah yeah, well well)

(This man is about to)
She wasn't afraid to cry
Emotion was in her eyes
She took me on a natural high
I said, I love you girl of mine
And then she said, "I love you back"
She loves me back (yeah yeah, well well)
She loves me back (yeah yeah, well well)
(Yeah yeah, well well)
Because she loves me back (yeah yeah, well well)

When I say that I love my girl
She says, "I love you back"
(Yeah yeah, well well)

When I tell my girl that I love her
She says, "she loves me back"
(Yeah yeah, well well)

(Yeah yeah, well well)
(Yeah yeah, well well)
(Yeah yeah, well well)
(Yeah yeah, well well)
(Yeah yeah, well well)
(Yeah yeah, well well)
(Yeah yeah, well well)
(Yeah yeah, well well)
