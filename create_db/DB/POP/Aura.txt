We all came back from the war
 I wish somebody would tell me the score
 We raked old Poseidon over the coals
 Shook his shells, shaked his shoals
 Where can a soldier fix himself a drink
 Forget the noise, forget the stink
 And the opium is running pretty low
 'Cause when the pain comes back, I don't want to know
 Across yonder ocean the natives are fierce
 Their ears are filled their teeth are pierced
 But it's not their spears that spill your breath
 They kill their enemies by loving them to death
 We were on some battlefield
 I felt something soft go through my shield
 I felt something warm enter my guts
 I was bleeding bad but there were no cuts
 They captured three of us, took us back to their village
 After a long long time I could decipher their language
 They worshiped Baal, they worshiped the sun
 They worshiped the son of the evil one
 They were more than voracious, they sucked our ambition
 They let me go on one condition
 That was when I came back to my native shore
 I tell you they don't want to play with us anymore
 But a part of me will never be free
 And the part that's free will never be me
 But a thing of love and beauty is in my head
 A message from my enemies, and here's what they said
 They said that love = hate
 And death = fate
 An enemy always = an adorer
 But priest = aura
 And life = time
 And time = space
 And space = sublime
 And human = race
 Oh and woman = man
 And pot = pan
 The fauna ought to equal the flora
 But priest = aura
 And beginning = the end
 The end always = the start
 But straight = bent
 The mind sometimes = the heart
 And you = me
 The land = the sea
 Richer = poorer
 And priest = aura
