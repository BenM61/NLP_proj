There's all kinds of music, everywhere you go
Some folks like it fast, and some like it slow
Some like it hot, some like it blue
Uh some like it old, and some like it new
Now I'm not liking country, and I'm not rappin' rap
You can make a man swing, just say my thing
No, I'm talkin' to dig, my step

(The only thing that turns me on)
Is when I hear a soulful song

I like soul with a capital S
Soul with a capital S
Sweet soul music, that's the best
Soul with a capital S

Music makes you happy, thinking makes you sad
It can do the worst thing to the best you ever had
For entertainment found you if you had to choose
You and me might disagree, 'cause I like rhythm and blues
Now I'm not missin' disco, I'm not saying punk is bunk
I can't settle for heavy metal, 'cause I got to have that funk

(The only thing that turns me on)
Is when I hear a soulful song

I like soul with a capital S
Soul with a capital S
Sweet soul music, that's the best
Soul with a capital S

Oh, there's people who tell you to get in with the times
It doesn't even matter that if your poem rimes
But I'm here to tell you, whatever comes along
There's something that gave up everyone 
And there ain't no right or wrong

Some rock makes you lazy
Highschool leaves you flat
And fusion drives you crazy
That's now funk is where it's at

(The only thing that turns me on)
Is when I hear a soulful song

I like soul with a capital S
Soul with a capital S
Sweet soul music, that's the best
Soul with a capital S

Oh, I like soul with a capital S
Soul with a capital S
Sweet soul music, that's the best
(Soul) with a capital S
(With a capital S)
(With a capital S)
(With a capital S)

Oh, I like soul with a capital S
Don't you know that I like soul (with a capital S)
You gotta give some of that soul (with the capital S)
Yes I like soul
(With the capital S)
(With the capital S)
(With the capital S)
(With the capital S)
(With the capital S)
Yey yeah
Yo old fellas 
Sounds like some of that Oakland music
You know what I talking about?
(Play that funky groove)
????
Play that funky groove
????

(Soul with the capital S)
Oh give some of that Soul
(With the capital S)
Oh I got to have that Soul
(With the capital S)
(With the capital S)
(With the capital S)
(With the capital S)
(With the capital S)
(With the capital S)
(With the capital S)
(With the capital S)
