He never knew my secret
But I for sure knew his
In the arms of nature
So let her take and give

The only thing that makes you grow
Is to dive into the sweet unknown
The only thing that breaks your bones
Is when you don't know where it hurts the most
When you don't know when it hurts

So come and bring my witches home
I still hold the flame
And let the eyes of wisdom roll
I still hold the flame
Dig deep baby, deep baby
There's so much we can't see baby, see baby
It's you and me so dig deep baby, deep baby
So come along because I still hold the flame

For followers of rivers
Darkness of the sin
The voices of latens
Who have nowhere to run

The only thing that makes you grow
Is to dive into the sweet unknown
The only thing that breaks your bones
Is when you don't know where it hurts 

So come and bring my witches home
I still hold the flame
And let the eyes of wisdom roll
I still hold the flame
Dig deep baby, deep baby
There's so much we can't see baby, see baby
It's you and me so dig deep baby, deep baby
So come along because I still hold the flame

Oh, oh
For the believers and the seekers
Oh, oh
For the speaker and the elders
I still hold the flame
I still hold the flame
For the protectors of the mother

So come and bring my witches home
I still hold the flame
And let the eyes of wisdom roll
I still hold the flame
Dig deep baby, deep baby
There's so much we can't see baby, see baby
It's you and me so dig deep baby, deep baby
So come along because I still hold the flame
For the believers and the seekers
