I don't need me a basketball player
All I need is somebody that's down for me
And he don't have to have money
His love is like honey it so sweet to me
He can have anything in this world
But hell sacrifice it all for me
And I made up my mind I'm in love this time
And it feels so real

And I
Know that he won't break my heart
And I
Know that we won't never part
This time
Time for us to settle down
And I
Want to be with him forever

They can say that I am crazy
For making him my baby
But that's how its gone be
See I done been trough many changes
But this one I ant changing
It gone stay the same
I can have anything in this world
But I'll sacrifice it all for him and I made
Up my mind I'm in love this
Time and it feels so real

And I
Know that he won't break my heart
And I
Know that we won't never part
This time
Time for us to settle down
And I
Want to be with him forever

I love you (and all of the things)
You do
(Oh baby please)I need you
(So believe me) I do

I love you (and all of the things)
You do
(Oh baby please)I need you
(So believe me) I do

They don't know how I feel
'Cause I know this is real

And I
Know that he won't break my heart
And I
Know that we won't never part
This time
Time for us to settle down
And I
Want to be with him forever
