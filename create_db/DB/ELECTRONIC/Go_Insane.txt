Two kinds of people in this world
Winners, losers
I lost my power in this world
Because I did not use it 

And I go insane like I always do
And I call your name, she's a lot like you 

Two kinds of trouble in this world
Living, dying
I lost my power in this world
And the rumors are flying 

And I go insane like I always do
And I call your name, she's a lot like you
