When I was a boy
I had a dream
It never came true
But somehow it seems
When I drift away and I know it's so
There's a certain time and place I go
Every heart's got it's moment
Written on it's soul
Just in a minute in it's lifetime
Of a happiness untold

For the smallest grain of sand in time
Your own shadow sets you free
And you turn to your reflection
And your heart cries out
Is it really me?
It's the girl in the sports car nineteen sixty one
And she's sitting in her Lusso
In the early morning sun

For the smallest grain of sand in time
Your own shadow sets you free
And you turn to your reflection
And your heart cries out
Is it really me?
It's the girl in the sports car nineteen sixty one
And she's sitting in her Lusso
In the early morning sun
That girl in the sports car
That girl in the sports car
Girl in the sports car
That girl in the sports car
