You should see the way you walk, the way you cut your hair
You should hear what the neighbors say, the way the neighbors stare
Everyone's got a different story but I got mine the hard way
Why'd I go and give my heart to a heart killer?

Heart killer, heart killer
Heart killer, heart killer
Heart killer

I can't breathe when I hear your name
You're in my veins and you're eating my brains

I saw you dancing in the basement
You were miles away
Part of me wanted it all to burn
And part of me wanted to stay
How could this be meant to be
When what I want is dead to me?
Why'd I gotta go and give my heart to a heart killer?

Heart killer, heart killer
Heart killer, heart killer
Heart killer

I can't breathe when I your hear name
You're in my veins and you're eating my brains
You're a

Heart killer, heart killer
Heart killer, heart killer
Heart killer

I can't breathe when I hear your name
You're in my veins and you're eating my brains
You

Promises only broken
Spitting in my hand
We made a floor
We made a love
Castles made of sand
Baby, you love like a love leaver
Just a touch and it's time to go
Why'd I gotta go and give my heart to a heart killer?

Heart killer, heart killer
Heart killer, heart killer
Heart killer

I can't breathe when I hear your name
You're in my veins and you're eating my brains
You're a

Heart killer, heart killer
Heart killer, heart killer
Heart killer

I can't breathe when I hear your name
You're in my veins and you're eating my brains
You're a

Baby, baby, can you save me?
Save me, baby, dig my grave
You're a

Heart killer, heart killer
Heart killer, heart killer
Heart killer
