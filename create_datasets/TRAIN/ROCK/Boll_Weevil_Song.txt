(Wah-hoo)
A-well, the Boll Weevil and the little black bug
Come from a-Mexico, they say
Came all the way to Texas
Just a-lookin' for a place to stay

Just a-lookin' for a home
Just a-lookin' for a home
(Doo, wop-wop)
 
A-well, the first time that I seen the Boll Weevil
He was a-sittin' on the square
A-well, the next time that I seen him
He had all his family there

Just a-lookin' for a home
Just a-lookin' for a home
(Doo, doo, wop, wop)

Well, the farmer took the Boll Weevil
And he put him on the red hot sand
Well, the Weevil said, "This is a mighty hot
But I'll take it like a man
This will be my home
This will be my home"

Well, the farmer took the Boll Weevil
And he put him on a keg of ice
Well, the Weevil said to the farmer
"This is mighty cool and nice
This will be my home
This will be my home"
(Doo, doo, wop, wop)

Well, if anybody should ask you
Who it was who sang this song?
Say a guitar picker from a Oklahoma city
With a pair of blue jeans on

Just a-lookin' for a home
Just a-lookin' for a home
(Doo-doo-wop-wop)
