I was born in a dump
Mama died and daddy got drunk
Left me here to die or grow
In a middle of Tobacco Road

Grew up in a rusty shack
All I had was hangin' on my back
Only you know how I loathe
This place called Tobacco Road

But it's home the only life
I've ever know
Only you know how I loathe
Tobacco Road
Gonna leave get a job
With the help and the graze from above
Save same money get rich I know
Bring it back to Tobacco Road
Bring dynamite and a crane
Blow it up start all over again
Build to a town be proud to show
Give the name Tobacco Road
