If i was a farmer
Instead of a faker
If i was a realer
and not just some raker
Raking through a memory
that just doesn't belong to me
Just someone I could of been
if only i kept walking...

Have another drink my son
Enjoy another cigarette
'Cause it's time you realised...
you're just an average man...

Alone on a motorway
you catch you're breath
Cat's eyes lead everyway
to lonesomness
Then you learn to hide your fears
and downsize your dreams
Still alive, still sincere
inside the scheme...

If this is darkness here
if this is darkness... coming

Have another drink my son
