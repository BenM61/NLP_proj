Run and hide, it's gonna be bad tonight
'Cause here comes your devil side
It's gonna ruin me
It's almost like, slow motion suicide
Watching your devil side, get between you and me

So tell me what I need to do
To keep myself away from you
To keep myself from going down
All the way down with you

Still I want you, but not for your devil side
Not for your haunted life, just for you
So tell me why I deal with your devil side
I deal with your dangerous mind, but never with you
Who's gonna save you now, who's gonna save you?

I can't lie but I don't miss those times
We were on a high, I thought it would never end
But you and I, we've come from the same long line
Good kids with a devil side, just going around again

So tell me what I need to do
To get myself away from you
To keep myself from going down
All the way down with you
All the way down with you

I want you, but not for your devil side
Not for your haunted life, just for you (just for you)
So tell me why, it's always your devil side
It's always your dangerous mind, it's never you
So who's gonna save you now, who's gonna save you?

So tell me what I need to know
To make you wanna change it all
To keep myself from going down
All the way down with you
All the way down with you

I want you, but not for your devil side
Not for your haunted life, just for you
So tell me why I deal with your devil side
I deal with your dangerous mind, but never with you
Who's gonna save you now, who's gonna save you?
Who's gonna save you now, who's gonna save you?

Who's gonna save you now?
Who's gonna save you now that I'm gone?
