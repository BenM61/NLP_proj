I don't want to hear your love song 
I got on this aeroplane just to fly 
And I know there's life below me 
But all that you can show me 
Is the prairie and the sky 

And I don't want to hear a sad story 
Full of heartbreak and desire 
The last time I felt like this 
I was in the wilderness 
And the canyon was on fire 

And I stood on the mountain 
In the night and I watched it burn 
I watched it burn, I watched it burn 

I would rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham 
I would hold my life in his saving grace 
I would walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham 
If I thought I could see, I could see your face 

Well, you really got me this time 
And the hardest part is knowin' I'll survive 
I've come to listen for the sound 
Of the trucks as they go down 
Out on ninety-five 
And pretend that it's the ocean 
Comin' down to wash me clean, to wash me clean 
Baby, do you know what I mean 

I would rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham 
I would hold my life in his saving grace 
I would walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham 
If I thought I could see, I could see your face 

I would rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham 
I would hold my life in his saving grace 
I would walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham 
If I thought I could see, I could see your face 

I would rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham 
I would hold my life in his saving grace
