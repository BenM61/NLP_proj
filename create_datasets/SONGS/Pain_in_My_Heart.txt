Pain in my heart
Is treating me cold
Where can my baby be?
Lord no one knows

Pain in my heart
Just won't let me sleep
Where can my baby be?
Lord where can she be?

And now the days
Has began to get tough
Said I want you to come back, come back
Come back baby
I had enough, oh

A little pain in my heart
Just won't let me be
Wake up restless nights
Lord, and I can't even sleep

Hmm, yeah
Stop this little pain in my heart

And now the days
Has began to get rough
Said I want you to love me, love me, love me baby
Till I get enough, oh

Pain in my heart
Little pain in my heart
Stop this little pain in my heart
Stop this little pain in my heart

Someone stop this pain
Someone stop this pain, oh
