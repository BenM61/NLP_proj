Free of any made-to-order liabilities 
Thank God I'm free 
Cos it's hard enough for me 
to take care of me, oh-oh

(Why cant you be like Endicott?) 

Cause I'm free 
Freer than a pirate on a frigate out at sea 
Thank God I'm free 
Driftin' all around just like a tumbleweed, oh-oh 

Maybe I need someone 
Someone who isn't undone 
Maybe an older woman 
Will tolerate me 
Maybe that certain someone 
Older and wiser woman 
Maybe the perfect someone 
To satisfy me
