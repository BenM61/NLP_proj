Mmmm, hmmmmmmm.

The night we met
I often remember two strangers meeting for the very first time
Now here we are facing each other
Two lovers holding on to something real
Something so meaningful
If you wanna know how I feel

I feel good (I feel good)
Baby, I feel good all over (baby, I feel good all over)
You and I had what others dream about
We finally worked it out

Say no more
You expression shows it
I see a little sunshine inside of you
Just to be with you, it's so excitin'
Who would have thought it could happen to me, mmmm
It's so secret we're in love
Even a little child can see

I feel good (I feel good)
Baby, I feel good all over (baby, I feel good all over)
You and I had what others dream about

You know I've been many places
I've seen lots of faces
Though I knew just about everything, everything there is to know
Yet you never (never) cease to amaze me
(Cease to amaze me)
The main reason I live is because you made me feel good

(I feel good)
Baby, I feel good all over (baby, I feel good all over)
When I think about all the good things you do, you do to me, baby
(I feel good)
Ooh, oh, oh, oh (I feel good)
Baby, I feel good all-all-all over
(Baby, I feel good all over)
The way you hold me and smile my way
(I feel good)
Ooh, I feel good (I feel good)
You make me, you make me feel so good
(Baby, I feel good all over)
Yeeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I feel so good
Ooh, ooh, yeah.

I feel good (I feel good)
Can't you see I feel good all over
(Can't you see I feel good all over)
I wanna let you know, yeah (let you know)
(I'll let you know I love you so)
I love you so, yeah (I feel good)
Yes, I do (I feel good)
Oh, baby. Oh, honey. Oh, sugar, I feel good all over
(Can't you see I feel good all over)
Sweet
Sweet things you say to me (oh, yeah)
Oh, oh, oh, I love it, love it.

(Can't you see I feel good all over)
You and I, we had what others dream about
We finally worked it out
