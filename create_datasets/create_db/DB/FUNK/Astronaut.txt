Living like an astronaut
Outta space you can see
Hasn't happened how I thought
But at least I see clearly

Out of mind I don't know why
I try to freeze frame as my hands move slow
Out of my mind I don't know why
I try to freeze frame as my mind lets go
Was on my way to love you
I was passing through you let me cruise oh
And I'm thinking of you girl
It's the truth I held on to
And now I float above you
While I'm in the sex I think of you
It's the way I keep it close until the day I
Get home
Get home
Get home
Get home
Get home

Living like an astronaut
Outta space you can hear me
It hasn't hit me how I thought
Separated by infinity
Get out of my mind I don't know why
Try to freeze frame as my hands move slow
Outta my mind I don't know why
Trying to freeze frame as my mind lets go
Was on my way to love you
I was passing through you let me cruise
I'm thinking of you girl
It's the truth I held on to
And now I float above you
While I'm in the sex I think of you
It's the way I keep you close
Until the day I get home

I'm on my way
Don't move so fast
Don't move so fast
I said hold on, I'm on my way home
Don't move so fast
Don't move so fast

Was on my way to love you
I was passing through you let me cruise
I'm thinking of you girl
It's the truth I held onto
And now I float above you
While I'm in the sex it' I think of you
Cause it's the way I keep her close
Until the day I get home
Get home
Get home
Get home
Get home
Get home
Get home
Get home
Get home
Get home
