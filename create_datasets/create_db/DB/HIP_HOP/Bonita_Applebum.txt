Bonita Applebum, hey hon, hey hon
Bonita Applebum, go 'head with yourself
Bonita Applebum, hey hon, hey hon
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on

I said Bonita Applebum, hey hun, hey hun
Bonita Applebum, go 'head with yourself
Bonita Applebum, hey hun, hey hun
Bonita, nita, nita, nita, nita, come on

Bonita Applebum, remember way back woo
When you used to play your knickers and your pigtail do
I used to be all on it like a fly
Back in the days, Bonita was a hit

I flirted and I flirted 'til there was no end
But she kicked the diabolical and said we was friends
Honey, you was funny, but I'm tired of that
It's three years later, I got a new rap

Got a little older, a tidbit wiser
I gained twenty pounds, six inches higher
Speakin' of high, I saw you smoke the hootie mack
Your ex-boyfriend claims he gets the booty back

But I'm here to testify, it'll be a hard try
Slappin' my knees, lettin' out sighs
Wanna keep you slammin' like a hip hop song
Bonita Applebum, gotta put me on

Bonita Applebum, hey hon, hey hon
Bonita Applebum, go 'head with yourself
Bonita Applebum, hey hon, hey hon
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on

I said Bonita Applebum, hey hun, hey hun
Bonita Applebum, go 'head with yourself
Bonita Applebum, hey hun, hey hun
Bonita, nita, nita, nita, nita, come on

I'll never shed a tear, but then again I won't steer
You wrong, I'll steer you strong, for affection steer ya here
I'll take you to a place that's farther than the you know
what do you know, if we go to El Segundo

Your presence should be close, so like on "Buddy", I'll toast
To the ever clever you, to say the least, you're the most
Honey, you're my honey, a yo dip, you're my dip
Treasure and forever, velvet pleasure with Tip

As we glide and move, cushy like a pillow that's soft and smooth
Ricky D said, we got to show and prove
Do it to the music that's the raw butt groove
Intimidate the boy

Cupid, that's his name, pickin' on us suckas
It's his flippin game, but Tip won't fall for that
Instead, I'll get the Natives and we rush to the latest Lamstons store
Get a six pack of hats for

Bonita Applebum, hey hon, hey hon
Bonita Applebum, go 'head with yourself
Bonita Applebum, hey hon, hey hon
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on

I said Bonita Applebum, hey hun, hey hun
Bonita Applebum, go 'head with yourself
Bonita Applebum, hey hun, hey hun
Bonita, nita, nita, nita, nita, come on
