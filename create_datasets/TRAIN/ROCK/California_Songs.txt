Well I got your late night call
You're in the center of it all
You're having a ball
And you're really doing fine
A west coast time
And I believe you

But here's one for the coast
And the people with the most
The pretty pretty folks
The west coast folks

And here we go again Its never gonna end
We're all so sick of California Songs
Yeah, We know you love L.A.
There's nothing left to say
Please no more California Songs 
And F*ck New York too

Yeah your heaven is a lie
Just more shit that I don't buy
And they're heading for the coast
They're moving out in droves
Sending back reports on the radio
With the messages the same
It's gettin' pretty lame
California dreaming's on the radio

And here we go again It's never gonna end
We're all so sick of California Songs
Yeah, We know you love L.A.
But there's nothing left to say
Please no more California Songs
And F*ck New York too
