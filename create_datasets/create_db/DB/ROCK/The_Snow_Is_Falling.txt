Snow is fallin'
Fallin' on the cold, cold ground
Snow is fallin, baby
Fallin' on the cold, cold ground
Gloom and misery
Gloom and misery all around

I used to be so happy 
Now all I do is cry
Well, I used to be so happy 
All I do is cry
Gonna buy myself a coffin
Well, I'm gonna lay right down and die

Well, people, if I die tomorrow
Who's gonna cry for me?
Hey, now, if I'm to die tomorrow
Well, who's gonna cry for me?
Well, I aint got nothin' 
But these blues and misery

Well, I guess you better come on and get me
Ain't got nothin' to lose
Oh, no, just come on and get me
Ain't got nothin' to lose
Well, I don't feel like livin' 
Life ain't nothin' but the blues
