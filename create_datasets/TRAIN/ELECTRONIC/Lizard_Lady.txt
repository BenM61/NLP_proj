What's a woman going to do but throw away her bread
Her feet are feeling funny as she lies beneath the bed
She reminisces of the pungent Adriatic Sea
And then she crawls and counts her cans and twitches like a flea

What she really likes to do is sit upon a pew
And make believe that time has stopped and motionless is new
Planes are stranded in the sky and drains are stopping, too
She alone is laughing under eyelids full of flu

She scurries hurries worries that the wicked will receive
Their candy from a handsome man and coffee from a thief
She gazes at a hourglass and asks it if it cares
And then she wonders if the lizard likes his lettuce rare

"Lizard, yes a lizard, little lizard of the sea
Conspicuously alcoholic, flicks his tongue at me
Release me, release me lizard, blizzard of the bee
Mushed inside a sock you still dare me to die
Dare me to die at home"

"Coating all my lungs with honey, sticky coating running runny
Feet of lizard fly and stop and fly and stop and fly
And flicker tongue is licking out to find me, feel me, hide!
Hide from the tongue"

"The tongue is coming! Cruising! Oozing!
Over land and under ashes, in the sunlight, see it flashes
Find a fly and eat his eye, but don't believe in me.
Don't believe in me, don't believe in me
Don't believe in me, don't believe in me
Don't believe in me"
