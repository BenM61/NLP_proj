I was born in a bass drum
Brought up by a guitar
My mama kept a house of hags
And my daddy dressed in drag

A hot nite in Dallas
Feel the southern wind
A hot nite in Dallas
And the sheets stickin' to my skin

Bodies laid in the gutter

Dark roll the moon
It shines through her gown
As the woman's taking me down

A hot nite in Dallas
Feel the southern wind
A hot nite in Dallas
And the sheets stickin' to my skin

Lay me in a pine box
In a dark desolate place
On a moonlit night
Nail a board above my face

A hot nite in Dallas
Feel the southern wind
A hot nite in Dallas
And the sheets stickin' to my skin
