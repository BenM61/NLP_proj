Last Thursday,
5:30
A shoot in Ladbrook Grove
Hours later
Hey waiter
Could you pour some more of those?

(All for you)
And when I'm all alone
(All for you)
I'm by the microphone
(All for you)
I see your photograph
(All for you)
Don't even want to laugh

Some secret
Must keep it
Hey, I wouldn't know who to tell
Next morning
Fair warning
Ooh, have you got something to sell?

(All for you)
And when I'm all alone
(All for you)
I'm by the microphone
(All for you)
I see your photograph
(All for you)
Don't even want to laugh

Wide awake
The cold cold light of day
Realize my taste
My taste just slips away
I say my taste just slips away

(All for you)
And when I'm all alone
(All for you)
I'm by the microphone
(All for you)
It's all for you
(All for you)
I see your photograph
(All for you)
Don't even want to laugh

Days later
Saw the paper
How did I fall for you?

(All for you)
And when I'm all alone
(All for you)
I'm by the microphone
(All for you)
It's all for you
(All for you)
I see your photograph
(All for you)
Don't even want to laugh

(All for you)
And when I'm all alone
(All for you)
I'm by the microphone
(All for you)
It's all for you
(All for you)
And I see your photograph
(All for you)
(It's all for you)
Don't even want to laugh
