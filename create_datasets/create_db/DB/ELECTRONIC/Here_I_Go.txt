Oh, I can't escape, I'm trapped 
And there is no safe place to go
And I do regret the things I did
But how on Earth could I know? 

Here I go, here I go 
catch me I'm falling deep
Here I go, here I go 
catch me I'm falling falling 

There's no way out, man you try to escape 
Concentrate your mind, 'cause you just might break 
into half, crack down fast 
I keep my face straight, no need to laugh 
I did some right, I did some wrong
I regret these things, hey, but I gotta stay strong 
I feel depressed, now don't you know? 
Catch me, 'cause I'm falling deep down below 

Oh, I can't escape, I'm trapped 
and there is no safe place to go 
And I do regret the things I did 
but how on Earth could I know? 

Here I go, here I go 
catch me I'm falling deep
Here I go, here I go 
catch me I'm falling falling

Now here's the question: any suggestions? 
You play it yourself, but yourself won't listen 
How do you mind feel like stressing
searching for answers, you keep on guessing
You messed it up, you're living low 
How far you'll go, man I don't know 
Come out the dark, I'll bring you in the light 
and leave your problems all behind 

Here I go.here I go, here I go again 

Catch me, 'cause I'm falling deep down below 

Oh, I can't escape, I'm trapped 
and there is no safe place to go 
And I do regret the things I did 
but how on Earth could I know? 

Here I go, here I go 
catch me I'm falling deep
Here I go, here I go 
catch me I'm falling falling
