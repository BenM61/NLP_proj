You are the cool earth
You are the city lights
You are the jewel forever in my sight

And you with the strong heart
You with the trusting words
You shutting your eyes
Slumber in your soft chair

Oh love him
Oh love him
Oh love him
Oh love him

I see you in the mellow sun
In weekday overalls
You with a hint of white and a wave of gold

You walk like blue ice
Tender but tough
You are my morning glory

Oh love him you are the sky my big sky
Oh love him you are the guy my big guy
Oh love him you are the sky my big sky
Oh love him you are the guy my big guy

2 little girls and 2 guys strumming
Howie and Louie start playing the blues
It had to be you, wonderful you
In all of me, baby

Oh

Oh love him you are the sky my big sky
Oh love him you are the guy my big guy
Oh love him you are the sky my big sky
Oh love him you are the guy my big guy

You are the cool earth (yeah yeah)
You are the gentle rain (yeah yeah)
You are the note that remains
You are my big sky

You are the cool earth (yeah yeah)
You are the gentle rain (yeah yeah)
You are the note that remains
You are my, you are my, you are my

You are the sky (sky sky)
You are the sky (sky sky)

You are the cool cool earth
You are the gentle rain
I love him
You are my big sky and my big guy
My big big sky 
Big guy
Big sky
Big guy
Big sky
My big sky
My big guy
