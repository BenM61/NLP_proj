I'm quite sure
That you never knew
All the pain that I've been through
Even this morning
Looked outside my door
For your letter on the floor
Seven long years
Of moving through the streets
Letting people in
But they don't talk to me
They look right through
Just like you (Just like you now)
They look right through
Just like you (Just like you, just like you yeah)

Sun comes up, I'm alone again
With the lights on in my head
Still loves us the wing, from my little room
'Cause I gotta go back soon

Other people's lives, all the long goodbyes
Watching in the mirror with longing in my eyes

They look right through oh oh
Just like you (Just like you now)
They look right through oh
Just like you (Just like you, just like you)
They look right through (They're looking right through me)
Just like you (Just like you babe)
They look right through (I can't believe it)
Just like you (Just like you, just like you)

I can't believe it, no no no
How can you change your mind?
Look right through me all the time
I'm gonna give you every part of me
But you just wanted to be free, yeah

They look right through
They're looking right through me
They look right through
They're looking right through me
They look right through
They're looking right through me

I'm wondering baby
Am I a piece of glass
In your mind?

They look right through
They're looking right through me
They look right through
They're looking right through me
They look right through
They're looking right through me
They look right through
They're looking right through me

I'm wondering baby
I'm wondering baby
I'm wondering baby
I'm wondering baby
I'm wondering baby
I'm wondering baby
I'm wondering baby
Am I a piece of glass
In your mind?

They look right through (Ho ho)
Just like you (Just like you now)
They look right through (Oh)
Just like you (Just like you, just like you)
They look right through (They're looking right through me)
Just like you (Just like you babe)
They look right through (I can't believe it)
Just like you (Just like you, just like you)

They look right through
Just like you
They look right through
Just like you (Oh, well, yeah)
