Come to me
Kill for me
Worship me
Follow everything I do
As you bow before me
I'm the one they told you
Would come again
Let me show you all the signs
To bring about the end

I'll take you down
To a hole where you
Will always be alone
I'll turn you out
On a world that doesn't
Care if you belong

I'll push you off
Of the throne that
You erected for yourself
You will be tossed
On a pile of all the
Filth that you created

I watched you take the power
In your hands and
Throw it all away
I knew you would
Fall down again someday

Come on now
You know I won't hurt you
Come on now
I'm here to protect you
Come on now I'll
Lead you to shelter
Come on now you know

I'll take you down
To a hole where you
Will always be alone
I'll turn you out
On a world that doesn't
Care if you belong

I'll push you off
Of the throne that
You erected for yourself
You will be tossed
On a pile of all the
Filth that you created

I'll take you down
To a hole where you
Will always be alone
I'll turn you out
On a world that doesn't
Care if you belong

I'll push you off
Of the throne that you
Erected for yourself
You will be tossed
On a pile of all the
Filth that you created
