I want to break free, I want to break free
I want to break free from your lies
You're so self-satisfied I don't need you
I've got to break free, God knows
God knows I want to break free

I've fallen in love, 
I've fallen in love for the first time 
(But) this time I know it's for real 
I've fallen in love, God knows God knows I've fallen in love 
It's strange but it's true (hey yeah) 
I can't get over the way you love me like you do 
But I have to be sure, 
When I walk out the door 
Oh, how I want to be free 
Oh, how I want to be free 
Oh, how I want to break free 

But life still goes on
I can't get used to livin' without, Iivin' without, livin without you 
By my side
I don't want to live alone (hey) 
God knows, got to make it on my own 
so baby can't ya see
I've got to break free 
I've got to break free
I want to break free 

I've got to break free from your lies
'Cause you are so self-satisfied 
But life still goes on and on
I got to make it on my own
I got to break free
