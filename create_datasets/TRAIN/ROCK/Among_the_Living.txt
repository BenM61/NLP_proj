Disease! Disease! Spreading the disease. 
With some help from Captain Trips, 
He'll bring the world down to his knees. 
Power, yes Power! He'll show them all his power. 

It pulses through his ice cold blood, 
A whole world to devour! 
Bridge He's seeing, he's calling, his legacy he's spawning. 
He's coming, corrupting, among the living! 

Murder! Murder! Commit cold blooded murder! 
Like Nazis during World War Two, they only follow orders. 
Hatred! Hatred! A crucifix is your bed, 
Once he turns his eye on you, you'll be better off dead! 

I'm the walkin' dude, I can see all the world! 
Twist your minds with fear, I'm the man with the power. 
Among the living, follow me or die! 
Man, fights Man! Divided they can't stand! 

United, they can battle back, and make him force his hand! 
Fear, yes fear! His end is growing near, 
He didn't count on Man's good faith, 
And their will to persevere. 

Follow me or die! 
Fire! Hot fire! Purge the world with fire!! 
Damnation is the price he'll pay, for an evil man's desire! 
Good, versus evil! The stand to vanquish evil! 
Man can only live one way, that place right in the middle. 

Follow me or die! 
Among Among Among Among Among Among 
Among Among Among Among Among Among!
