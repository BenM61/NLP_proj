What can change in the?
I'm a black rat with a cool basement
But back is still hazing in every part
Trapped inside by rats red hound

Why if you knew?
I could have gone wrong
So these mistakes be with you

I did not feel too
Trapped in a basement way too long
Fucked in the cracks and see how it looks
Lookin' for someone

And not being dead from the start

Why if you knew?
It could have gone wrong
So these mistakes be with you

Didn't I wait too long?
Left in a basement way too long
Why if you knew?
It could have gone wrong
So these mistakes be with you
Trapped in a basement way too long
Trapped in a basement way too long

I rock when you cross this love
