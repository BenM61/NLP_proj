Every single night in bed
A black cross says
"Perhaps you're getting better
I'd like to thank you for your efforts
To promote what really matters
Whenever you're about to fall
Remember this, it's not a news flash
Don't pretend to know it all, but go ahead
Call it a cocoon crash

What I really see in you
Is nothing like the things you do
As you are doing them right now
What you would really love to win
To become the air as well as trash
Is to get rid of all your skin
Go ahead, call it a cocoon crash

Call it what you will, call it what you will
Go ahead, call it a cocoon crash"

Suddenly the ego that I used to have
is no bigger than an eyelash
Clearly I remember someone told me
"Hold on tight, here's your cocoon crash
What I really see in you
Is nothing like the things you do
As you are doing them right now
What you would really love to win
To become the air as well as trash
Is to get rid of all your skin
Go ahead, call it a cocoon crash

Call it what you will, call it what you will
Go ahead,..."
