All I need is some sunshine
All I need
All I need is some sunshine
All I need

The siren called beyond the treeline
With another one for the caves
And in the tarn beyond those birches
Is a spirit that I crave

And from the island people watched you
You set that viking ship ablaze
We reached the moon falls icy cauldron
And found the spirit that I crave

All I need is some sunshine
All I need
All I need is some sunshine
All I need

You've fallen barefoot past the treeline
Peeping boned-eyed, birches sway
And a thousand whitefish floating belly up
In the spirit that I crave

And we threw ourselves right into it
Where lay the bodies had been claimed
We dove a third, a fourth, a fifth
Banned to the spirit that I crave

All I need is some sunshine
All I need
All I need is some sunshine
All I need

I found empathy from madness
Deliverance from malaise
My heart is filled with gladness
And you're the only spirit that I crave

All I need is some sunshine
All I need
All I need is some sunshine
All I need
