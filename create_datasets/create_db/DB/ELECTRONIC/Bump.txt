I was working at the club in 1995
Sunday was the night that the gay club came alive 
See, I would carry ice 
And the crowd was just so nice that my phobia drowned
While I was getting down 

[Chorus]
I met the finest girl of my life
That night, at gay night
I met the finest girl of my life
That night, at gay night
Gay night, it's all right, don't be uptight

See, half way through the evening 
I saw this women gleamin' from across the room
She was with some guys
But when they gave me the eyes 
I knew she was just their friend
We went out all weekend

[Chorus: x4]
