The half life of my life is, no life at all
To wit
Success has fit me like a shroud
Oh you fox
What mischief are you up to know

All we had to do
Was take boat number to watch
Now we sleepon the couch
Cats eat out of our mouth
Should have knelt should have never have stayed
Now we've come undone man howdy
We jumped into a canyon
