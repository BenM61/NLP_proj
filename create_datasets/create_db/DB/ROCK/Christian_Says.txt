Christian says everyone's to love him
Christian says just let go
Christian says you can't be happy being this way
Christian says he'll never let you go
Christian says he can't let you, let you run free
'Cause Christian says he needs you so
In this age of frozen freaks
The only highs we get are low
In this age of cold relief
Brings only what a way to go
With money in your pocket
You say wise and always free
But with that money in your pocket
You've got nowhere to go
But baby, baby, baby wants an empire
Baby, baby, baby needs a real thief
'Cause baby, baby, baby wants an empire
Baby, baby, baby wants a real piece
These words hang empty in the air
The only sounds you speak are dumb
And I'm a a vampire
In this age of golden grief
Your own reflection's on the blink
This burning issue won't cease
This burning issue's got to go
'Cause baby, baby, baby wants an empire
Baby, baby, baby needs a real thief
Baby, baby, baby wants an empire
Baby, baby, baby wants a real piece
