Say it with your actions
Saying those words to me
Doesn't mean a thing to me
I don't wanna hear them
Baby you can keep those three
You might as well not even speak

Many different times before
You were almost out the door
Then you'd say it
And I'd forget everything
Well I'm sorry to report
That's not working anymore
Now I need to see if that's really what you mean
No more "I'm sorry"
"I love you"
I need proof
Baby boy it's all in what you do
(no more)I love you
If it's true baby boy
It's all in what you do

Say it with your actions
Say it in the way you touch
And the things that you do for us
I don't wanna be mean
But when it comes to this love
Saying it ain't enough

Many different times before
You were almost out the door
Then you'd say it
And I'd forget everything
Well I'm sorry to report
That's not working anymore
Now I need to see if that's really what you mean
No more "I'm sorry"
"I love you"
I need proof
Baby boy it's all in what you do
(no more)I love you
If it's true baby boy
It's all in what you do

It's in what you
It's it's in what you do
It's in what you
It's all in what you do

No more "I'm sorry"
"I love you"
I need proof
Baby boy it's all in what you do
(no more)I love you
(baby) If it's true baby boy
It's all in what you do

It's in what you
It's it's in what you do
It's in what you
It's all in what you do
