I see you in the morning
You're the color of my rising sky
Freen sky above as my stone behind is a clearing
The opened storm been into
I have found my place of comfort and refuge
I can spend all my time right here by your side

Purple valley all covered in four leaf clovers
And your eyes, everlasting shades of blue
I'd share with you the smell
Sights and sounds of the springtime
Our love will grow with the rains that have fallen

Rolling down hills and climbing
Mountains and crossing oceans
Hand in hand together once again we stand
