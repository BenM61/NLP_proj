You go squeeze in your dress, and go strap on your boots
I'm gonna sharpen my nails and primp up real cute
I'm gonna smoke up a storm and step into the night
I'm getting ready to burn, I'm getting ready to fly

I said a, hey, are you shooting to kill
Hey, would I tell you a lie
We'll be slamming tequilas, popping hydrogen
And lose the coils and the kinks that are wrecking my life

Give me a drink, don't be talking so much, you're a pain in the butt
How can I think when you puke up your guts, I'll be juiced on this stuff

We'll be wired all night
We hit the high life
We'll be wired all night
We hit the high life
Watch me now

You blew a jelly-face Joe, Pedro the pimp
I'm as hard as a brick, hope I never go limp
Is the earthquake shaking, is there gonna be war
Tell the National Guard to mind the grocery store

I said, hey, and I don't give a hoot
Hey, I need some earthly delights
I'll be drowning my sorrows, banging my box
'Til the sirens start singing and I'm ready to fly

Give me a drink, don't be talking so much, you're a pain in the butt
How can I think when you puke up your guts, I'll be juiced on this stuff

We'll be wired all night
We hit the high life
We'll be wired all night
We hit the high life

Give me a drink, don't be talking so much, you're a pain
in the butt
How can I think when you puke up your guts, I'll be juiced
on this stuff
I'll be kicked in the nuts

We'll be wired all night
We hit the high life
We'll be wired all night
We hit the high life
