I just want to talk to you
I won't do you no harm
I just want to know about your different lives,
On this here people farm
I heard some of you got your families, 
Living in cages tall and cold
And some just stay there and dust away,
Past the age of old

Is this true? 
Please let me talk to you
I just want to know about,
The rooms behind your minds
Do I see a vacuum there or am I going blind?
Or is it just remains from vibrations and echoes long ago
Things like love the world and let your fancy flow

Is this true? 
Please let me talk to you, let me talk to you
I have lived here before the days of ice
And of course this is why I'm so concerned
And I come back to find the stars misplaced
And the smell of a world that has burned
The smell of a world that has burned

Well maybe, maybe it's just a change of climate
I can dig it I can dig it baby 
I just want to see

So where do I purchase my ticket
I would just like to have a ringside seat
I want to know about the new mother earth
I want to hear and see everything
I want to hear and see everything
I want to hear and see everything
Yeah
Aw shucks 
If my daddy could see me now
