Come on
I wanna grow my hair, live in Bel Air
Lose my head, keep live snake in my bed
I wanna backstage pass
Drink Bon Jovi's booze for free
I wanna be a star
And buy a hundred guitars
Eat everything I can bite
I wanna feel a little danger
Feel a little stranger
Angel city tonight

I got a buncha boys
We make a lot of noise
Little bit crazy,
Playing with chemical toys
We're such bad ass dudes
Almost can't stand it myself
I wanna get the crabs
In my elegant rags,
Make my mom and daddy uptight
I wanna be an intellectual
Heterosexual, angel city tonight
Come on

I'm gonna live in L. A. drinkin' all day
Lay by the pool
And let the record company pay
Talking to the devil on the batphone all of the time

I'm gonna kick ass
I'm gonna spit broken glass
I'm gonna shoot out all of your lights
I wanna eat dirt,
I'm gonna eat my own shirt
Angel city tonight

Angel city 
Angel city 
The way I'm used is a shame and a pity
Angel city 
Angel city rock'n'roll alright
Angel city 
Angel city 
The women here ain't got no pity
Angel city
Angel city 
Shape up and fly right
