You're doing everything your people said to
I'd hate to be the one to break it to you
It's only sad 'cause it's true
They misled you when they bred you
Somebody said some things they had no right to
Somehow they stuck, then you were known as someone who
Could simply not follow through if he had to
(But you have to, don't you?)

You don't have to be a genius, but it helps to (helps to)
Fools and charlatans, they may get wise
But only cream and bastards rise, and you can see it in their eyes

You followed good advice to the letter
You know your friend?
He's doing so much better than you are ever likely to do
He'll eclipse you and he will not miss you

You don't have to be a genius, but it helps to (helps to)
All the also-rans are real nice guys
But only cream and bastards rise:
People who can buy and sell you
Sharing a joke that they will never tell you
You think you're dialed in
Someone has to win, and you know what that means
It means someone's gotta lose
It's probably you

It's not a race, it's not a competition
And if it were you'd be in no position to
Get them to listen to you if you had to
Not even if your life depended on it

You don't have to be a genius, but it helps to (helps to)
Some are aliens, the rest are spies
But only cream and bastards rise, and you can see it in their eyes
