the changing face of the earth
tides washing away
all kinds of pain
and ever lasting way
with no space to be hurt 
and nothing to say 
not willing to bare some pain
how do we maintain 

when everyone we know 
and every living thing
eventually grows old
but where does it begin
and everyone we know
thinks that we begin
eventually will go
surely it will end
