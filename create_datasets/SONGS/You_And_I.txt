I've never seen the light
That people talk about
You open up my wallet
And dust falls out

That's alright with me
Because the songs that I'll sing
Won't be blue mmm yeah
Honey you and I

No more lonely nights

I'll never make the headlines
Or the evening news
There won't be rags to riches
Story for me oh

But the songs that I sing
Won't be blue
Uh yeah
Honey you and I ooh you and I

No more lonely nights

Take me there
The truth the faith I have in you
Yeah yeah yeah
It's our melody

It's what we do together
My Jesus you open up my heart
You make me laugh
When I'm feelin' down

No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights
