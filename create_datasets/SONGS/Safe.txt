Is this life for livin'?
Oh, ease my mind, ease my mind
Tell me I'm forgiven
Ease my mind, oh, ease my mind

Oh, stay close
Don't go, I gotta know

Or until tomorrow I'll be staring out the window
Thinkin', "Please, keep her safe, keep her safe"
Until tomorrow I'll be watchin' every shadow
Thinkin', "Please, keep her safe, keep her safe"

Oh
Oh
Oh
Keep her safe, keep her safe

Fate placed us together
Oh, tell me why, oh, tell me why
So if you can't face forever
Then tell me lies, oh, tell me lies

Oh, stay close
Don't go, I gotta know

Or until tomorrow I'll be staring out the window
Thinkin', "Please, keep her safe, keep her safe"
Until tomorrow I'll be watchin' every shadow
Thinkin', "Please, keep her safe, keep her safe"

Oh
Oh
Oh
Keep her safe, keep her safe
Oh
Oh
Oh
Keep her safe, keep her safe

Is there a moment, there in love
We ever thought we've got enough?
So stay with us, you're safe with us

Or until tomorrow I'll be staring out the window
Thinkin', "Please, keep her safe, keep her safe"
Until tomorrow I'll be watchin' every shadow
Thinkin', "Please, keep her safe, keep her safe"

Oh
Oh
Oh
Keep her safe, keep her safe
Oh
Oh
Oh
Keep her safe, keep her safe

Until tomorrow I'll be staring out the window
Thinkin', "Please, keep her safe, keep her safe"
