Say, lady, can I ask you why
You're treating me like a step child
With a future not so bright
I thought you said
You would never be that way to me
You said you'd never leave me for the rest of my life

I believe you all the times you said, baby
You're always on my mind
I don't believe you
So save those words you said to me
And I'll be on my way
I've got to say goodbye baby

(Bridge:)
You didn't want my love
That's what starts the pain, baby
You didn't need my love
I think that's your game

Goodbye, goodbye
You'd never be that way to me
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
I've got a love that you will never see, hey

I guess you thought you had me strung out on your love
Simply because you're oh so fine
It takes more than looks to steal my heart away from me
So I'm sorry, baby the joke's on you this time

(Bridge)

You didn't want me love
You didn't want me love
That's what starts the pain
That's what starts the pain
You didn't want me love
You didn't want me love
I think that's your game

Goodbye, goodbye
You'd never be that way to me
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
I've got a love that you will never see, hey

Goodbye, goodbye
I've got to say goodbye
I've got a love that you will never see
Here we go
I'm on a rampage
This is my stage
'Cause I'm the T, to the E, to the V, to the I, to the N
That's where it starts, here we go

Goodbye, goodbye
You'd never be that way to me
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
I've got a love that you will never see, hey

Goodbye, goodbye
