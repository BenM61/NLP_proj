There's a sea of lonely swimming sad
Looking just for an arm to grab
I don't need to understand
I'm just lending you the two that I have

[Chorus]
You might be drifting
And can't find the shore
So hopeless and all alone
The waves are crashing all around you
Just when you've lost the will to live
You see the sun

Can we make a searchlight
From all the bridges that we burn?
Do you see a rescue?
Or a deeper kind of hurt?

Who could love you,
Who could hold you?
I'd swim across the sea
You don't have to be alone
Where the shallow gets so deep

[Chorus]

I am hurt and nearly drown
(Open up your eyes)
I cry for help you turned around
(Open up your eyes)
Farther from the shore
Or you'll be farther from the shore

I am hurt and nearly drown
(You're not alone)
I cry for help you turned around
(I'm not letting go)
Farther from the shore
So you're not farther from the shore

[Chorus]
