A-why did I do it? A-why did I do it?
I asked myself a hundred times and then I start to cry
It's up to my neck now I'm runnin' like a dog
I can't remember how it started, but it's 2 late 2 turn back the clock

I gotta keep on and on and on and on
Oh my hearts prayin' for a heart attack
I'm gonna collapse a but I better not
I'll get a few years for the things I've done

I'll never see the sunrise no more what the hell
I gotta keep on, fighting for my sanity and for family
And for my baby oh for my baby
Bullshit aside yea I knew how to play the game right

But this time I made a mistake and I'm gonna pay the price
I'd rather be payin' to the grim reaper, than the law keeper

I'm runnin' I'm runnin' I'm runnin' out of time
To late to waste time in haste, I fell to my knees to pray for your god 
But your god wasn't there for me
So I prayed to myself for long life and stamina 

I do believe I was startin' to lose my nerve and my mind 
I heard a little voice screamin'
If you do the crime you will send for the time
If you do the crime you must render the time 
If you do the crime you must render the time

Shit I won't bow down to that
A belly of a priest won't have its name on a slip no
I gotta keep on movin' & groovin', I gotta keep on movin' & groovin'
I gotta keep my mind clear 4 the devils and the demons I will not fear
The devils and demons I will not fear

I'm on the run, ten more minutes and I'm gone
I'm on the run, ten more minutes and I'm gone
I'm on the run, ten more minutes and I'm gone
I'm on the run, ten more minutes and I'm gone

I'm on the run, ten more minutes and I'm gone
I'm on the run, ten more minutes and I'm gone
I'm on the run, ten more minutes and I'm gone
I'm on the run, ten more minutes and I'm gone
