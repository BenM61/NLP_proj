Mama's and Papa's, People Like Us
People like us,
So much in love,
People who just trust one another.
Oh, what a dump,
Now it's a palace.
Where a Dixie cup becomes a chalice. 
For people like us (For people like us), 
So much in love (So much in love)

Lassos of love (lassos of love)
Twirling around us (twirling around us)
A magical space in the city that surrounds us. 
Now is the time,
Blow out the candles. 
A nursery rhyme too hot to handle.
For people like us 
So much in love

Oh, what a dump,
Now it's a palace
Where a Dixie cup becomes a chalice 
For people like us, 
So much in, so much in love,
In love

For people like us,
(For people like us) 
For people like us,
(For people like us)
For people like us
