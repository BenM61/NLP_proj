3 AM
Nowhere else to go
It's 3 AM and I miss you so
Couples are departing soon they'll all be gone
Now another day is starting
Still I linger on with

Blue Champagne
Purple shadows and blue champagne
With the echoes that still remain
I keep a blue rendezvous

Bubbles rise
Like a fountain before my eyes
And they suddenly crystallize
To form a vision of you

All the plans we started, all the songs we sang
Each little dream we knew
Seems to overtake me
Like a boomerang
Blue is the sparkle, gone is the tang

It's your refrain,
Keeps returning, as I remain
With all the memories and blue champagne
To toast the dream that was you
I'm bluer than blue champagne
