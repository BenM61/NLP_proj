What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas,
But what if it don't?
What happens in my head stays in my head,
But sometimes it won't.
What if you knew what I was thinking?
Would it make you like "Whoa!"?
I don't wanna risk putting my foot in this
So I keep my mouth closed.

(Chorus)
All you hear is "Uh uh uh uh uh uh"
Gonna button my lips so the truth don't slip
Uh uh uh uh uh uh
Gotta beep out what I really wanna shout
Whoops! Did I say it out loud?
Did you find out? (oow yeah)
I wanna have your babies
You're serious like crazy
I wanna have your babies
I see 'em springing up like daisies.

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Some of my feelings keep escaping
So I make it a joke
Nonchalant I keep on faking
So my heart don't get broke
I'm in a big, big, big, big ocean
In a tiny little boat
I'll only put the idea out there
If I know it's gonna float.

(Chorus)

(Bridge)

'Cause in my head there's a slot machine
And I'm betting you're the one in my hopes and dreams
La la la la la, la la la la la la la
La la la la la, la la, la la...
Trust me it'd scare you
If you knew what was going on in my brain
Trust me it'd scare you
That I picked out the church, or the schools or the names
If you knew it was all about you
Every wish, every candle, every coin in the fountain
Trust me it'd scare you

That's why I go, Uh uh uh uh uh, uh uh
Uhm... yeah

(Chorus x2)

This one, this another, this one, oow...
Babies, babies, babies, babies...
I wanna have your babies
I...
Yeah yeah ha ha and maybe you'll find out...
