Falling around me lay, parts of my life
I'm leaving them all behind
We leave with the night
Living in strange ways
Has cast me aside
I cry in another world now
I must search for all my days gone by

[Chorus:]
Dreamer lead me ever closer
Here is where I belong
Inside my own existence
I have been for so long

Voices that call to me, lay silent to hide
Soon I will hold them close
With words from my eyes
Living in hope of you
Loving you now
You are my waking thoughts
I lay with you in my sleeping hours

[Chorus]
I stand and gaze upon your smile
A deep reflection
Held in my soul as a child
To grow within the warmth of love
Long forgotten
Tears flood your eyes in a moment
Dreamer, I become as one within you
To lose you far away

I stay inside your heaven now
No longer lonely
Once more I'm safe in your arms
To feel your touch
Across my mind
Fills me only full of desire for my being
Dreamer, really all that needs a meaning
To feel us sail away

[Chorus]
