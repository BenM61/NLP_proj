The things I know
The things I know
Never have the same glow
Passing through your rainbow

The things I feel
Never have the same hold
Till I've finally found you

Now you make me feel like choosing love against doubt
Love against doubt

Oh oh oh

'Cause I want to fade out with you
I would fear nothing
I would fear nothing

'Cause I want to fade out with you
I would fear nothing
I would fear nothing

The things I hear 
Never have the same sound 

Till I've finally found you 

Now you make me feel like choosing love against doubt 
Love against doubt 

'Cause I want to fade out with you
I would fear nothing
I would fear nothing

'Cause I want to fade out with you
I would fear nothing
I would fear nothing

Things I know 
Never have the same glow passing through your rainbow 
Never have the same hold 
Till I've finally found you
Till I've finally found you
Things I hear never have the same sound
Things I hear never have the same sound
Till I've finally found you
Till I've finally found you

Cause I want to fade out with you 
I would fear nothing
I would fear nothing

Cause I want to fade out with you 
I would fear nothing
I would fear nothing
