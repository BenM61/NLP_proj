All of me, all of me wants all of you
I know that boys are all the same
They want to be a Casanova
They think that love is just a game
And not worth crying over

But I been thinking about you
Since you've been looking at me
And I've got something to say

I know some girls who run around
Like life is just a movie
But pretty soon they all find out
Things are not worth losing

Though I'm attracted to you
And yes I wanted you too
But I've got something to say

Boy oh Boy
Won't share you with another
All of me wants all of you
Boy oh Boy
Don't want a part time lover
All of me wants all of you

I know you've got some other girls
I think 'bout my reputation
Woh, woh, woh
You've got to stop your running wild
Make love your destination
Woh, woh, woh

Though I'm attracted to you
And yes I wanted you too
But I've got something to say

Boy oh Boy
Won't share you with another
All of me wants all of you
Boy oh Boy
Don't want a part time lover
All of me wants all of you

Boy oh Boy
Won't share you with another
All of me wants all of you
Boy oh Boy
Don't want a part time lover
All of me wants all of you

Boy oh Boy
All of me wants all of you
Boy oh Boy
All of me wants all of you

I know that boys are all the same
They want to be a Casanova
They think that love is just a game
And not worth crying over

But I been thinking about you
Since you've been looking at me
And I've got something to say

Boy oh Boy
Won't share you with another
All of me wants all of you
Boy oh Boy
