You're the one I've been waiting for
Take me down to the sandy shore
Summer love would be good for me
If you would be my summer love.

It's the start of my happiness
And the end of my loneliness
Summer love could be paradise
Or twice as nice, my summer love

The tides roll by and waves of love
Will sweep into your heart
If that's the way it's meant to be
We'll never, never part

By the time that the leaves turn brown
Other loves may come tumbling down
Ours will last through eternity
If you will be my summer love.
