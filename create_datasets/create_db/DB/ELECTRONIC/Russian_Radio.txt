I hear a voice, from ten thousand miles away 
I have no choice, our love was meant to stay 
With or without, it's easy for me, without a doubt 
As I spend my days, searching for ways 
Love is on the go, so is radio 

Russian radio, how will we ever believe you 
Radio, now that we've learned to deceive you 

There is a sound, it's underground 

Moving out for miles around 
There is a sound, it's underground 
Let's move it out boys 

I hear a voice, from one hundred miles away 
Getting so much closer, everyday 
With or without, it's easy for me, without a doubt 
As I spend my days, searching for ways 
Love is on the go, so is radio 

Russian radio, how will we ever believe you 
Radio, now that we've learned to deceive you 

I feel our love, is only a smile away 
Getting so much closer to me everyday 
With or without, it's easy for us, without a doubt 
As we spend our days, searching for ways 
Love is on the go, so is radio
