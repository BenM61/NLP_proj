Oh, well, one bad stud moved in my neighborhood
Oh, well, one bad stud moved in my neighborhood
He's big and man I know he ain't no good

He don't wear no hat and Lord he don't wear no shoes
He don't wear no hat and Lord he don't wear no shoes
He just hangs on the corner singing old country blues

Oh, well, one bad stud, one bad stud
One bad stud, one bad stud
I said, "One, one, one, one, one bad stud"

Oh, if he likes your baby, you can kiss your baby goodbye
Oh, if he likes your baby, you can kiss your baby goodbye
'Cause girls all love him like a schoolboy loves his pie

He loves his whiskey, he loves his rock and rye
Yes, he loves his whiskey, he loves his rock and rye
You know it takes ten bottles to make that fool get high

Oh, well, one bad stud, one bad stud
One bad stud, one bad stud
I said, "One, one, one, one, one bad stud"

Oh, well, he stole ten dollars and they locked that cat in jail
Oh, he stole ten dollars and they locked that cat in jail
He got my baby to come and pay his bail

He's got great big muscles, Lord he looks like a bear
Yes, he's got great big muscles, Lord he looks like a bear
When the cat gets nervous you know I won't be there

Oh, well, one bad stud, one bad stud
One bad stud, one bad stud
I said, "One, one, one, one"
