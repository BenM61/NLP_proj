A penny for my thoughts you say
You want to know what I could be thinking
But as I speak the music starts to play
And the words just somehow slip away

[Chorus]
Read my mind
It will tell you that I love you and
You're all I ever wanted in a man
You'd see how I feel
What my head won't let my heart reveal
If only you could read my mind

One look from you and look at me
I'm trembling like a little girl
I tell myself if I can just believe
Any day now you'll fall in love with me

[Chorus]

Tell me if you feel the same way I do
And tell me that I'm not mistakenly taken with you

You're all I ever wanted in a man
You see, all I need is everything you are to me
If you could somehow read my mind
You would see what I can't seem to say
If only you could, if you would read my mind
Read my mind
