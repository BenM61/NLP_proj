You're such a beautiful freak
I wish there were more just like you
You're not like
All of the others

But that is why I love you
Beautiful freak
Beautiful freak
That is why I love you
Beautiful freak
Beautiful freak

Some people say
You have a problem
But that problem
Lies only with them
Just 'cause you are not like
The others

That is why I love you
Beautiful freak
Beautiful freak
That is why I love you
Beautiful freak
Beautiful freak

Too good for this world
But I hope you will stay
And I'll be there to see
That you don't fade away

You're such a beautiful freak
I bet you are flying inside
Duck down and then go for cover

You know that I
I love you
Beautiful freak
Beautiful freak
Beautiful freak
Beautiful freak
Beautiful freak
Beautiful freak
