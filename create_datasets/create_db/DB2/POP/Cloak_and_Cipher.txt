Ight it leaks through
Makes my day
Know all you love
It lacks soul
And all of the candle may catch
What you can use

I just saw you
Rhythm I tried
It would take you only a while
And to take it suddenly fair it won't do

Why'd you say you what up and went?
Lied to kid you when you said send
Though meanwhile that soft hate
It was true

Never saw you live in that call
Lookin back and write on the wall
Did you think it would beat this heart well
String it through

Loose choir
Unsteady on the stage
What you lovest well remains
Loose choir
Love it well and it will stay

Lose that
I won't redeem another
Lose that
I won't redeem another
Lose that
I won't redeem another
Lean on the need

And I know you never knew quite
How it feels I've opened the night
It's enough that connections aren't when
It was true

I just saw you with him
I tried
It would only take you a while
And to take it suddenly fair
It won't do

Never saw you live in that call
Lookin back and write on the wall
Did you think it would beat this heart well
String it through

Loose choir
Unsteady on the stage
What you lovest well remains
Loose choir
Love it well and it will stay

Lose that
I won't redeem another
Lose that
I won't redeem another
Lose that
I won't redeem another
Lean on the need
