Baby hair with a woman's eyes
I can feel you watching in the night
All alone with me and we're waiting for the sunlight
When I feel cold you warm me
And when I feel I can't go on you come and hold me
It's you
And me forever

Sara Smile, Sara Smile
Won't you smile awhile for me, Sara

If you feel like leaving you know you can go (you know you can go)
Why don't you stay until tomorrow?
If you want to be free, you know, all you've got to do is say so
When you feel cold, I'll warm you
And when you feel you can't go on, I'll come and hold you
It's you
And me forever

Sara smile, Sara smile
Won't you smile a while for me, Sara, oh Sara
Oh, smile
Just smile awhile for me, Sara please
Sara, Sara smile, oh
Smile
Yeah
Smile
Won't you smile a while for me, Sara, oh
Come on
You know that makes me feel
You know how that makes me feel
To see you smile, oh
Sara, Sara, Sara
