Welcome back hang out the flags I'm not bitter
Well hey for you
You stole the show
Back from the cold
Did you miss me?
Bet you stayed in all the time

Remember me?
I used to be something didn't I?
But it's not my time now
I'll be leaving
Stay inside
I hate goodbyes
Don't be bitter now
We could spend a lifetime in a weatherhouse

Where have you been?
What made you leave?
I'm still waiting impatiently
You and I side by side
Always missing
One for rain and one for shine

Remember me?
I used to be something didn't I?
But it's not my time now
I'll be leaving
Stay inside
I hate goodbyes
Don't be bitter now
We could spend a lifetime in a weatherhouse

Don't, it will end in tears and I won't be sorry
Don't, it will end in tears and I won't be sorry
Don't, it will end in tears and I won't be sorry now
Don't, it will end in tears and I won't be sorry
Don't, it will end in tears and I won't be sorry
Don't, it will end in tears and I won't be sorry now
We just crossed a line, we just crossed a line.
