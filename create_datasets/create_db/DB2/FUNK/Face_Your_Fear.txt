You can scream if you want to baby but no one can hear
You can fight through the night but by day light you'll disappear
If there's a way to be ok I'm sorry it's just not clear
While you lay let me say that you're the only one here

By the way
Maybe
Don't worry
It's ok
Just face your fear
Just face your fear

If you're afraid of the grave be brave and just pick up the phone
I know how it gets everyone's sun sets baby you're not alone
If you look away from your day I'd just say so long
And again my good friend I'd recommend to stay strong

By the way
Maybe
Don't worry
It's ok
Just face your fear
Just face your fear

Just be cool cool when it meets you
Don't be breaking up
Just be cool cool when it meets you
Don't be givin' up

By the way
Maybe
Don't worry
Everyday
Just face your fear
Just face your fear

Just be cool cool when it meets you
Don't be giving up
Just be cool cool when it meets you
