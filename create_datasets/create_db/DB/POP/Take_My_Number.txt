Do you mind if I sit down next to you?
Yeah, I remember you from school
You seem to have a good heart
Way back then, you were gonna make it big
But it's divorce, now with a couple kids
That brings you back to these parts

Everybody stumbles
Everybody hits the ground
No use running scared
When those changes come around
Cause you don't know what might
Be waiting for you tonight

You really shouldn't drive
You've had too much to drink
You shouldn't be alone
Where all you're gonna do is think
So take my number
Or I can take you home
We can find a cup of coffee
We can sit all night and talk
There's a diner always open
Just around the block
So take my number
Or I can take you home

All those dreams
That were gonna set us free
What did we ever know at 23
About what we really wanted?
Everybody's got a fire
That's always gonna burn
No way to put it out
All we ever do is learn
And you don't know what might
Be waiting for you tonight

Oh, you really shouldn't drive
You've had too much to drink
You shouldn't be alone
Where all you're gonna do is think
So take my number
Or I can take you home, yeah

We can find a cup of coffee
We can sit all night and talk
There's a diner always open
Just around the block
So take my number
Or I can take you home

Take you home
Take you home
Take you home
I can take you home

Do you mind if I sit down next to you?
Well, I remember you from school
You seem to have a real good heart

Oh, you really shouldn't drive
You've had too much to drink
You shouldn't be alone
Where all you're gonna do is think
So take my number
Or I can take you home

We can find a cup of coffee
We can sit all night and talk
There's a diner always open
Just around the block
So take my number
Or I can take you home
Take my number
Or I can take you home
