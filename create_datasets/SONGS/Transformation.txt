Rust to dust, us to them
Change your mind, change your skin
Life to death, weak to strength
Cash a check, change your sex

Day to night, dark to light
Hard to soft, on to off
Push to shove, hate to love
In and out, it's all about

They're just transformations
Variations, alternations, deviations
You know, Mother Nature rules us all

I move and I go
In time, fast or slow
I move, because
Each time there's some more

Wet to dry, eye to eye
Yin to Yang, pleasure or pain
Good to bad, crazy or sane
You make the rules, then you play the game

Fist to glove, lose or win
You live a life of sin, then you're born again
Trash to art, heart to heart
Big or small, we're all a part

They're just transformations
Variations, alternations, deviations
You know, Mother Nature rules us all
