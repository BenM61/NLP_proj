Even if the lights go out
Even in the summer rain
Even if the sun comes up
Ooh, we keep on dancing, keep on

Even if the lights go out
Even if the rock is long
Even if our heart is broken
Oh, we keep on dancing, keep on dancing

Please tell Rosie
I'm not gonna come back
'Til September 'cause music is my best friend
Once you tell her
To water the flower
I wanna to remember
Music is my best friend

Please tell Rosie
I'm not gonna come back
'Til September 'cause music is my best friend
Once you tell her
To water the flower
I wanna to remember
Music is my best friend

Please tell Rosie, keep on dancing

Even if the lights go out
Even in the summer rain
Even if the sun comes up
Ooh, we keep on dancing, keep on

Even if the lights go out
Even if the rock is long
Even if our heart is broken
Oh, we keep on dancing, keep on dancing

Please tell Rosie
I'm not gonna come back
'Til September 'cause music is my best friend
Once you tell her
To water the flower
I wanna to remember
Music is my best friend

Please tell Rosie
I'm not gonna come back
'Til September 'cause music is my best friend
Once you tell her
To water the flower

'Til September 'cause music is my best friend
Once you tell her
To water the flower
