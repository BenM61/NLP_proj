On a ticket Tokyo return
Colour evening palaces that burn
Some expression leading to the sky
They will wait until you learn to fly
Chorus
Hand held in black and white
Into the northern light
Fly like a silver wing higher
Catching the southern wind
Gliding and other things
Fly like a silver wing higher
Inner visions written on the wall
In graffiti winner takes it all
Take a chance and put your money down
We will race you high above the ground
Repeat chorus
Inner visions written on the wall
In graffiti winner takes it all
Take a chance and put your money down
We will race you high above the ground
Repeat chorus to fade
