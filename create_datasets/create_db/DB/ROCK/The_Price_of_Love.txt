One lonely night, I heard you calling
But it was only the sound of a heartbeat breaking the walls
As time moves on, words say it all
Now I've got only the sound of the silence breaking the fall

Some things will never change
But it might take a miracle to turn you around
Some things will never change
The dreams you kept inside, you find them lying on the ground

Stranded in the night, lonely is the price of love
I would gladly sacrifice, only for the price of love
I would hang my soul to dry, maybe for the price of love
And it cuts you like a knife, the price of love

Behind the light, where dreams are woven
I see you and me in a mirror breaking it down
It's no surprise, we count the pieces
But we can't let go of a fire that's burning us down
 
Some things will never change
But it might take a miracle to start it again
Some things will never change
So hold onto the hope, and we'll fight it till the end

Stranded in the night, lonely is the price of love
I would gladly sacrifice, only for the price of love
I would hang my soul to dry, maybe for the price of love
And it cuts you like a knife, the price of love

When I close my eyes, I can feel you now and then
But I kind of lose the touch
Something in my mind is growing off and on and on again

Stranded in the night, lonely is the price of love
I would gladly sacrifice, only for the price of love
I would hang my soul to dry, maybe for the price of love
And it cuts you like a knife, the price of love
