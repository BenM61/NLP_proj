Crusader, Crusader, please take me with you
The battle lies far to the East
Crusader, Crusader, don't leave me alone
I want to ride out on your Quest

I'm waiting, I'm waiting, to stand by your side
To fight with you over the sea
The're calling, they're calling, I have to be there
The Holy Land has to be free

Fight the good fight
Believe what is right
Crusader, Lord of the Realm
Fight the good fight
With all your might
Crusader, Lord of the Realm

We're marching, we're marching to a land far from home
No-one can say who'll return
For Christendom's sake, we'll take our revenge
On the pagan from out of the East

We Christians are coming, with swords held on high
United by Faith and the cause
The Saracen heathen will soon taste our steel
Our standards will rise 'cross the land

Fight the good fight 
Believe what is right
Crusader, Lord of the Realm
Fight the good fight
With all your might
Crusader, Lord of the Realm

To battle, to battle, the Saracen hordes
We follow the warrior king
Onward, ride onward, into the fight
We carry the sign of the cross

Warlords of England, Knights of the Realm
Spilling their blood in the sand
Crusader, Crusader, the legend is born
The future will honour your deeds

Warlords of England, Knights of the Realm
