Good morning captain
Good morning to you sir, hey, hey, yeah
Do you need another mule skinner
Out on your noon day run? Hey, hey, yeah
Yodel-ay he he, he, he, he he he he he he

I'm a lady mule skinner
Out on old Tennessee way, hey, hey, yeah
I can make any mule listen
No I won't accept your pay, hey, hey, yeah
Yodel-ay he he, he, he, he he he he he he

Hey, hey little waterboy
Won't ya bring that water round, hey, hey, yeah
Well, if you don't like your job
Why you can throw your bucket down
Throw it down, boy, throw it down now
Yodel-ay he he, he, he, he he he he he he
Yodel-ay he he, he, he, he he he he he he

Muleskinner blues
