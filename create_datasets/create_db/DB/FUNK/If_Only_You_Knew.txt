I must have rehearsed my lines
A thousand times
Until I had them memorized
But when I get up the nerve

To tell you the words
Just never seem to
Come out right
Hmmm

If only you knew
How much I do
Do love you
Oh, if only you knew 

How much I do
Do love you
I dream of moments we share
But you're not there

I'm living in a fantasy
'Cause you don't even suspect
Could probably care less
About the changes I've been

Going through
Oh, if only you knew
How much I do
Do love you

Oh, if only you knew
How much I do
Do need you
'Cause you don't even suspect

Could probably care less
About the changes I've been
Going through
If only you knew

How much I do
Do love you
Oh, if only you knew
How much I do

Do need you
Oh, oh if only you knew
How much I do
Do love you

Oh if only you knew
How much I do
I do need you
Oh, if

If
If I love you, yes
You don't know
I said you don't know how much I need you, suga

Oh, I said you don't know
That I love you
And I will show I love you
