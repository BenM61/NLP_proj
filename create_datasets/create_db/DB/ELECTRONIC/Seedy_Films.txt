Sleazy city
Seedy films
Breathing so heavy
Next to my neighbour
Let's get acquainted
Getting to know you
Feeling sleazy
In seedy sin city
Feeling sleazy
In seedy sin city

Sleazy city
Sleepy people
Down in your alleys
Seems that anything goes
Blue films flicker
Hands of a stranger
Getting to know you
And I'm getting to like you

Hey that's fine
Got no time
Meet me on Friday
Down, down, down in blue city
Got no address
Just a telephone number
Phone me tonight
And maybe we can talk dirty
Phone me tonight
And maybe we can talk dirty

Sleazy city
Sleepy people
Down in your alleys
Seems that anything goes
Blue films flicker
Hands of a stranger
Getting to know you
And I'm getting to like you

Hey isn't that you on the screen
Isn't that you on the screen
(No that's not me)

Getting to know you
Getting to like you
Etc...
