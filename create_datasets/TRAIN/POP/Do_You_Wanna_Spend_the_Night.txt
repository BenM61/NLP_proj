We got the whole night to ourselves soft music to play
First look and I fell in love
You just blew me away
Your eyes tell me everything
True expressions don't lie
This moment in time is ours, but it's passing us by

Do you wanna stay, do you wanna spend the night
Do you wanna just make love
Or do you wanna spend the night

You make me fell easy
Easy such a nice style
Tonight is that magic time
That comes once in a while

Do you wanna stay, do you wanna spend the night
Do you wanna just make love
Or do you wanna spend the night

Do you wanna stay, do you wanna spend the night
Do you wanna just make love
Or do you wanna spend the night

Do you wanna stay, do you wanna spend the night
Do you wanna just make love
Or do you wanna spend the night
