My life was brought into a nightmare, dark shadows surrounded me
Five times the pain of torture is buried deep within me
It makes me shiver down my spine to even think of it

Talk to me, what is the reason
I'm finished, answer me
Completely blinded by agony

Save me from my tears

Save me, falling down, angels of clarity (I am dead by anxiety)
Save me, frozen inside, angels of clarity (I am dead by anxiety)

I'm going insane, it feels like I am lost, the panic, the fear
The mind tricks are haunting me, is this my destiny

Talk to me, what is the reason
I'm finished, answer me
Completely blinded by agony

Save me from my tears

Save me, falling down, angels of clarity (I am dead by anxiety)
Save me, frozen inside, angels of clarity (I am dead by anxiety)

Leaving all tears behind (angels of clarity, show me the way)
Leaving my past behind (I'm about to fade away, show me the way, angels of
Clarity)

Save me from my tears

Save me, falling down, angels of clarity (I am dead by anxiety)
Save me, frozen inside, angels of clarity (I am dead by anxiety)

Save me, falling down, angels of clarity (I am dead by anxiety)
Save me, frozen inside, angels of clarity (I am dead by anxiety)
