Stay with me baby, stick around me sometimes 
Stay with me baby, stick around me sometimes 
You know the only one to ease my worried mind 

I get your kindling mama and a brick of coal 
I get your kindling mama and a pinch of coal 
You got the nerve to tell that you don't want to know 

Stay with me baby, stick around me sometimes 
Stay with me baby, stick around me sometimes 
You know the only one to ease my worried mind 

Stay with me baby, stick around me sometimes 
Stay with me baby, stick around me sometimes 
You know the only one to ease my worried mind
