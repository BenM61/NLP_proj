Close your eyes
For the night is falling
Fear no dark
For it's warm and safe
And looks familiar
As it comes approaching
Come with me
And I will take you

A world beyond your sleep
Beyond what's real
An in safety hidden sphere
Away from our daily reality
Truth lies out there 
Truth lies out there 

As the innocent
Lay their heads down
As the night chants it's
Luring call
Cross the borders of
Sense and foresight
Come with me
And I will take you
You don't have to be afraid

A tear is only water
A sigh is only air
Whenever you feel haunted
The truth lies out there 
The truth lies out there 

A world beyond your sleep
Beyond what's real
An in safety hidden sphere
Away from our daily reality
Truth lies out there 
Truth lies out there
