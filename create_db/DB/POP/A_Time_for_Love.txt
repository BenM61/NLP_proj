A time for summer skies
For hummingbirds and butterflies
For tender words that harmonize with love

A time for climbing hills
For leaning out of window sills
Admiring the daffodils above

A time for holding hands together
A time for rainbow-colored weather
A time of make believe that we've been dreaming of

As time goes drifting by
The willow bends and so do I
But all my friends, whatever sky above

I've known a time for spring, a time for fall
But best of all, a time for love
