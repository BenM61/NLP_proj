Eat, sleep and crap
For to prey on your needs
Down a dark street
In backwater leeds
I seen yer comin'
Come in, lads!
You seen the ad? 
Too bad, bad, bad

What you get
Is what you see
It's a trickledown theory
And it's coming to me
Life's a whip-round
And I've got the whip
It's a sinking ship
Drip, drip, drip

Drip, drip, drip goes the water

Take me in
Throw me out
Put me up
Let me down

Dark, satanic
Run-of-the-mill
Sing us a song
And I'll send you the bill
My nicotine grip
My smokin' gun
It's how I get my fun
Better run, run, run

Your olfactory nerves
All up the spout
You can't smell a rat
When your nose is out
Rent-to-kill
By any other name
Kiss an old flame
Shame, shame, shame

Drip, drip, drip goes the water

Take me in
Throw me out
Put me up
Let me down
