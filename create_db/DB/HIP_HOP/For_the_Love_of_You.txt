A man in my shoes runs a light
And all the papers lied tonight
But falling over you
Is the news of the day
Angels fall like rain
And love is all of heaven away

Inside you the time moves
And she don't fade
The ghost in you
She don't fade
Inside you the time moves
And she don't fade

A race is on I'm on your side
And hearing you my engines die
I'm in a mood for you
For running away
Stars come down in you
And love, you can't give it away

Inside you the time moves
And she don't fade
The ghost in you
She don't fade
Inside you the time moves
And she don't fade

Don't you go
It makes no sense
When all your talking supermen
Just take away the time
And get in the way
Ain't it just like rain
And love is only heaven away

Inside you the time moves
And she don't fade
The ghost in you
She don't fade
Inside you the time moves
And she don't fade
