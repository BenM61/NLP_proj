See what am I supposed to say
To hope that maybe one day you'll stay

'Cause when my heart beats all time
I'm hoping one day you'll be mine
Well maybe today day you'll see

I'm crowed and conversatin'
And if you get to deep you'll be left waitin'
Hopeless like you missed the last train
But I promise there's so much left to gain
My hearts cold it'll warm to you
My minds on overtime but it'll stop for you
My eyes were wandering but they got stuck on you
Shit, there's something special 'bout you
Yeah, there's something special 'bout you

You see I'm sure you heard it all before
Like it's all you and nothing more
Your're so much more than a new face so kiddy shit
How 'bout a game of kiss chase?
Now listen it's just to options but I don't mind either
It's yes or yes, yes or yes, yes or yes, yes or yes

'Cause when my heart beats all time
I'm hoping one day you'll be mine
Well maybe today day you'll see
Shit, there's something special 'bout you

'Cause when my heart beats all the time
I'm hoping one day you'll be mine
Maybe today
Maybe today
