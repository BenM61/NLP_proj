Before you I was a church
Without a nickel or a prayer
Before you I was a soul
Without a lighter, held up in the air

Don't know if I ever could thank you
Near enough for the love since we met
For every sunrise and sunset

We light up the night
The spark, it will rise
It's more than enough
To steal the dark from the skies

We light up the night
We're forever young
You know true stars shine brighter than warm
We light up the night

Light up, light up the night
Light up, light up the night
Light up, light up the night
Light up, light up

Before you I was apart
With no glitter on the floor
Before you I was less calm
With no hope
Kissin' me out the door

You're a dream I was always dreaming
Can't believe I'm finally awake
Holding you 'til the day break

We light up the night
The spark, it will rise
It's more than enough
To steal the dark from the skies

We light up the night
We're forever young
You know true stars shine brighter than warm
We light up the night

Light up, light up the night
Light up, light up the night
Light up, light up the night
Light up, light up

We light up the night
The spark, it will rise
It's more than enough
To steal the dark from the skies

We light up the night
We're forever young
You know true stars shine brighter than warm
We light up the night
