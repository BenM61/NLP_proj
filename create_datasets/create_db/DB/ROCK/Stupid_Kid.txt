There are things that used to make me smile
One of them was you for just a little while
You left me for dead so far away
I replaced you with fear and shame
You'll be happy on the day I
Die

There are things that used to make me laugh
But now they're deeply buried in the past
I left them there so far away
Replaced my humor with my pain
I'll be happy on the day it
Dies

Remember when I said I love you, well
Forget it, I take it back
I was just a stupid kid back then
I take back every word that I said

There are things that used to make you cry
One of them was me for just a little while
Why is it that you had to say
Goodbye in your special way?
You slashed the tires on my
Car

Remember when I said I love you, well
Forget it, I take it back
I was just a stupid kid back then
I take back every word that I said

Remember when I said I love you, well
Forget it, I take it back
I was just a stupid kid back then
I take back every word that I said
