I hope it's not too late for me 
Been driving too fast along this road 
Will I survive this if I pray for hope, I hope, whoa
Sometimes it's hard to put the gun down
It's heading back there every single hour
The demons remain I know oh oh oh

This is not a song about love,
'Cause I'm happy alone
Won't sing about, don't know nothin' about love
'Cause I'm happy alone
Won't sing about, won't sing about love,
Won't sing about, don't know nothin' about love
Won't sing about, don't know nothin' about love

So happy alone
I'm happy alone, ooo
I'm happy alone

Won't sing about, won't sing about love,
Won't sing about, don't know nothin' about love
Won't sing about, don't know nothin' about love

How's it gonna end, this story,
It really doesn't matter where it goes,
How more can I take it before I blow, explode, oh
Looks like the stars keep falling
And the mountains they're so big today
The demons remain I know

This is not a song about love,
'Cause I'm happy alone
'Cause I'm happy alone, yeah
How happy alone
How happy alone

Won't sing about, won't sing about love,
Won't sing about, don't know nothin' about love
Won't sing about, don't know nothin' about love

I no longer fear the pain
Control's taken right out my head*
Just listen to the words
This is not about love

No nothing round here ever changes
I'm still on my own in the world 
I can't sing about love

This is not a song about love,
'Cause I'm happy alone

Won't sing about, won't sing about love,
Won't sing about, don't know nothin' about love
Won't sing about, don't know nothin' about love

'Cause I'm happy alone

Won't sing about, won't sing about love,
Won't sing about, don't know nothin' about love
Won't sing about, don't know nothin' about love

So happy alone, nothing about love, this is my love

So happy alone
Won't sing about, won't sing about love,
Won't sing about, don't know nothin' about love
Won't sing about, don't know nothin' about love, love

Won't sing about, won't sing about love,
Won't sing about, don't know nothin' about love
Won't sing about, don't know nothin' about love
