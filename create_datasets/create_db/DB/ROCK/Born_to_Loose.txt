That's the way it goes
The city is so cold
And I'm, I'm so sold
That's why I know

I said hit it!
Born to lose
Born to lose
Born to lose
Baby I'm born to lose

Nothing to do
I've nothing to say
Only one thing that I want
It's the only way

I said hit it!
Born to lose
I said hit it!
Born to lose
I said hit it!
Born to lose
Baby I'm born to lose
Baby I'm born to lose

Living in a jungle
It ain't so hard
Living in the city
It'll eat out, eat out your heart

I said hit it!
Born to lose
I said hit it!
Born to lose
I said hit it!
Born to lose
Baby I'm born to lose
Baby I'm born to lose
Baby I'm born to

I said hit it!
Born to lose
I said hit it!
Born to lose
I said hit it!
Born to lose
Baby I'm born to lose
Baby I'm born to lose
