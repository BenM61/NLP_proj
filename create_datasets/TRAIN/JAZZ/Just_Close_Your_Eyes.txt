Let me take you to Capri
And we'll sail to Neapoli
Oh, what lovely sights we'll see
Just close your eyes

Picture us in London town
While the rain is drifting down
See the diamonds of the crown
Just close your eyes

Imagine tropic waters gleamin'
Though we're only dreamin'
When you're in love it makes you feel
Each dream you dream is real

We can watch the sun in Rome
Sparkling on a palace dome
While we're holding hands at home
Just close your eyes

Though we're only dreamin'
When you're in love it makes you feel
Each dream you dream is real

We can watch the sun in Rome
Sparkling on a palace dome
While we're holding hands at home
Just close your eyes
