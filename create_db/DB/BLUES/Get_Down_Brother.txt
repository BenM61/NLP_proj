Now listen here, brother
You may can't understand
I might would ke'p a woman
But I will never ke'p a man

So, please get down, big boy
Man, you big enough to walk
And when I tell you 'bout a job
Hoo, Lord, you say you don't want no talk

You said you'd never work
As long as you was free
So, brother because I'm workin' 
Why you pick on me?

So, please get down, big boy
Man, you big enough to walk
And when I tell you 'bout a job
Hoo, Lord, you say you don't want no talk

'Play it one time'

You'll come by my house
With a great long lie
You can say-a, 'Hello, friends
I'm just passin' by'

You come to stay a day
And you stayed a week
And when my wife
Asked you to do her a favor
You pretend you were 'sleep

So, please get down big boy
Man, you big enough to walk

And when I tell you 'bout a job
Hoo, Lord, you say you don't want no talk.

Um-um-um!
