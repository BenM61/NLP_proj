I got a date tonight with such a sweet little innocent thing
I'll sweep 'er off her feet before she knows what's a-happening
I'm gonna hand her (ooh) my "sweet-talkin'" line
I know it kills her (shriek!) every time
She's gonna love me from the start
And then I'm gonna break her heart

'Cause if you're not a gentleman, you're gonna hear from me
Oh, yes I will 
Yes, I will 
Oh, yes I will, yes I will, yes I will!!

I'm just a big bad wolf, I know tonight I'll be looking' so good
She'll be a helpless child just like a-Little Red Riding' Hood
I'm gonna charm her (mmm!) right into a trance
I know she'll never (wow!) stand a chance
She's gonna love me from the start
And then I'm gonna break her heart

'Cause if you're not a gentleman, you're gonna hear from me

Oh, yes I will 
Yes, I will 
Yes I will, yes I will, yes I will!!

But I'm a lover!!!

Man, my reputation!!
