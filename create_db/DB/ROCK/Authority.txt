Monday yawning, school's so boring
Or go to work like a jerk and end up snoring
Tuesday's mail never fails
Collection agency wants me in jail
Wednesday's rules got me ignoring, deploring, all my tensions roaring
Thursday same shit different day
But these motherfucking rules will never ever go away

F*ck the rules 

Friday night gonna be out of sight
If you're 21 they say drinking might be fun
On Saturday, Bible says seventh day
The day of rest so have it your way
Go for a ride, keep it under 55
Respect the badge, don't drink and drive
On Sunday gotta survive these fascist fools
Take your freedom back from the bullshit rules

Call me paranoid call me what you will 
I got a fucking feeling something big is going down

F*ck the rules 

Call me paranoid call me what you will 
I got a fucking feeling something big is going down

F*ck the rules
