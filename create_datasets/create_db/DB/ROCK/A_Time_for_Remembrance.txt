It's a time for remembrance
Time to recall the things
I couldn't think of yesterday
Now my eyes bear no resemblance
To the eyes that used to rise
At every word you'd say
But I can't hide the memory of you away
Today or any other day
It's a time for remembrance
And I'll open my eyes

Now the chime in the steeple
Reminding me of summer sights
And nights that wouldn't end
Even unfamiliar people 
Walking by, they sigh
And know I've lost my only friend

I used to tell myself
Just dust in your eye
They couldn't be tears
You know, you don't cry
It's a time for remembrance
Time to cry
And, I'll cry

No I can't hide the memory of you away
Today or any other day
It's a time for remembrance
A time to cry
And, I'll cry
And, I'll cry
I'll cry
