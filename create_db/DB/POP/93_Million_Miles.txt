93 million miles from the sun
People get ready, get ready
'Cause here it comes it's a light
A beautiful light
Over the horizon in to your eyes

Oh, my, my
How beautiful
Oh my beautiful mother
She told me

Son in life you're gonna go far
If you do it right
You'll love where you are
Just know that wherever you go
You can always come home

240 thousand miles from the moon
You've come a long way to belong here
To share this view of the night
A glorious night
Over the horizon is another bright sky

Oh, my, my
How beautiful
Oh my irrefutable father
He told me

Son sometimes it may seem dark
But the absence of the light is a necessary part
Just know, that you're never alone
You can always come back home

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
You can always come backback

Every road is a slippery slope
There is always a hand that you can hold on to
Looking deeper through the telescope
You can see that your homes inside of you

Just know, that wherever you go
No you're never alone
You will always get back home

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh

93 million miles from the sun
People get ready, get ready
'Cause here it comes it's a light
A beautiful light
Over the horizon in to our eyes
