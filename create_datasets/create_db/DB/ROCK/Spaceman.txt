It started with a low light
Next thing I knew they ripped me from my bed
And then they took my blood type
It left a strange impression in my head
You know that I was hoping
That I could leave this star-crossed world behind
But when they cut me open,
I guess that changed my mind
And you know I might
Have just flown too far from the floor this time
'Cause they calling me by my name
And the zipping white light beams
Disregards the bombs and satellites

That was the turning point
That was one lonely night

The star maker says, it ain't so bad
The dream maker's going make you mad
The spaceman says, everybody look down
It's all in your mind

Well now I'm back at home, and
I'm looking forward to this life I live
You know its gonna haunt me
So hesitation to this life I give
You think you might cross over
You're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
You better look it over
Before you make that leap

And you know I'm fine
But I hear those voices at night sometimes
They justify my claim
And the public don't dwell my transmission
Cause it wasn't televised

But, it was the turning point
Oh what a lonely night

The star maker says, it ain't so bad
The dream maker's going make you mad
The spaceman says, everybody look down
It's all in your mind

The star maker says, it ain't so bad
The dream maker's going make you mad
The spaceman says, everybody look down
It's all in your mind

My global position systems are vocally addressed
They say the Nile used to run from east to west
They say the Nile used to run, from east to west

And you know I'm fine
But I hear those voices at night
Sometimes

The star maker says, it ain't so bad
The dream maker's going make you mad
The spaceman says, everybody look down
It's all in your mind

The star maker says, it ain't so bad
The dream maker's going make you mad
The spaceman says, everybody look down
It's all in your mind

It's all in my mind
It's all in my mind
