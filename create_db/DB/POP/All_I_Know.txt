I bruise you
You bruise me
We both bruise too easily
Too easily to let it show
I love you and that's all I know

All my plans
Have fallen through
All my plans depend on you
Depend on you to help them grow
I love you and that's all I know

When the singer's gone
Let the song go on

But the ending always comes at last
Endings always come too fast
They come too fast
But they pass too slow
I love you and that's all I know

When the singer's gone
Let the song go on
It's a fine line between the darkness and the dawn
They say in the darkest night, there's a light beyond

But the ending always comes at last
Endings always come too fast
They come too fast
But they pass too slow
I love you and that's all I know

That's all I know
That's all I know
