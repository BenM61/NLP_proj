You've got it easy but you've got the nerve to make a face
Although I'm struggling you can tell because I keep the page
We're out together but I feel you're pushing me aside
Lend me a hand sometimes, the thought won't even cross your mind 

You need to take a good look at yourself 
'Cause I'm about to close our jar
If you need a servant girl find someone else
Time to step up 

'Cause if I go 
I'd be taking more with me 
Than you would care to lose
Time is up, step it up 
Or you see me walk away
Just so you know 
Nothing you can do can make me turn around again 
Time is up, step it up 
Or you see me walk away

If we're together why you're pushing me away? 
You're taking chances boy, we're getting closer to the day
You need to take a good look at yourself 
'Cause I'm about to close our jar 
If you need a servant girl find someone else
It's time to step up 

'Cause if I go 
I'd be taking more with me 
Than you would care to lose
Time is up, step it up 
Or you see me walk away
Just so you know 
Nothing you can do can make me turn around again 
Time is up, step it up 
Or you see me walk away

'Cause if I go 
I'd be taking more with me than you would care to lose
Time is up, step it up 
Or you see me walk away
Just so you know 
Nothing you can do can make me turn around again 
Time is up, step it up 
Or you see me walk away
