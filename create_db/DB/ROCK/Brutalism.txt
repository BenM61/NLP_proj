Baby, right now you must know
That this love is brutal
Beyond physical
Supernatural
And full irrational
I'm not stranger at taking risks
I've bet my life on one kiss
I know this is dangerous
We're delirious
But oh this is glorious

When I'm alone at night and the TV is on
I grab your t-shirt and put it over my face
I put my hand on my chest so it feels like you're here
And I'd fly 10,000 miles just to kiss you again

Brutalism
Brutalism
Our love is heavy and hard
Desire might be the thing that tears us apart

And when my heart is tired and I can't take any more
I just remember your eyes in the corridor
Your eyes in the corridor

When I'm alone at night and the TV is on
I grab your t-shirt and put it over my face
I put my hand on my chest so it feels like you're here
And I'd fly 10,000 miles just to kiss you again

Brutalism
Brutalism
Our love is heavy and hard
Desire might be the thing that tears us apart

Brutalism
