I'm the ice man baby, I sell the coldest stuff in town
I'm the ice man baby, yes I sell the coldest stuff in town
Anytime you get hot baby, call up your ice man and I'll cool you down

Every man's got a woman, and every boy's got a chick
Every man's got a woman, oo-hoo and every boy's got a chick
But you don't have to worry about no ice man, cause your ice man always have his pick

You owe me for fifty pounds, yes and you claim you ain't got no dough
Listen to me baby
You owe me for fifty pounds, and you come around here tellin' you ain't got no dough
Well if you pay me some of my money, I ain't gonna put in your box no more

I sell ice to all the women
To all the finest chicks in town
Won't their husbands be real softy
When they find out what the ice man puttin' down
I'm the ice man baby, yes I sell the coldest stuff in town
And won't their husbands be real softy, 
Huh, when they find out what the ice man puttin' down
And I sell the coldest stuff in town!
