I know You're messing with me
Doing things I can't believe
And I like it
Yeah I like it

You take imperfect away
Leave all that's good in place
And it's all right
Yeah it's all right

How You take an ordinary life
And fill it till it's full of light
Because of Your love
And I know you see straight through me
And I trust what you are doing
'Till I'm shining like a diamond

I was only a stone
Cast out and all alone
When you found me
Yeah you found me

I know that in your eyes I'm treasure
Just like a prize
And I'ts so sweet
Yeah It's so sweet

Oh, let me shine
Like a diamond
In your eyes
I know
