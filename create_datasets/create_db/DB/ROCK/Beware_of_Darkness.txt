Close your eyes deep in the 13th dark night
I send out a prayer to you
Close your eyes you can see the 13th Bleeding light
I send out prayer to you

Eyes that shine from deep inside
Never fade away
Eyes that shine from in my mind that's into your heart
And now that it's shining through the way

And you can see anymore
That's into my heart
Don't let it stop never fade away
I can feel you anymore
