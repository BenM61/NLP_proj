Call me baby, we can get hot
Come and get my love girl on the wo

Stay at mine, sounds fine
Say your gonna feel me, baby that can thrill me

But you can pick up the phone, and you can dial
And when you're feeling lonely, I can see you right through
And if you tell me that you want it
Then I can make love on the line with you [Rocky B]
