When I walk in your shoes
I understand a man confused
There must have been but I don't care
I feel the way your soul does there

Darling they empathize
Looking through your bloodshot eyes
And I know you you're so frustrated
Above we all become what we once hated
Be slight nobody can be that wise

I can't help you if you won't help yourself
No I can't help you if you don't help yourself
You can only get so much from someone yeah
You can get so much from me
I can't help you if you won't help yourself

You've got the degree in philosophy
So you think you're cleverer than me
('Cause you so smart)
But I'm not just some drama queen

(Drama queen)
'Cause it's where you're at not where you've been
So what do you expect from me
(What do you want)

To hold your head above the sea
(Keep you high and dry)
And carry you even though you're bigger
'Cause don't you know you crush my tiny figure

And anyway we're still so young
(Yeah I'm so young)
And this isn't yet the day

I can't help you if you won't help yourself
No I can't help you if you don't help yourself
(You won't help yourself)
You can only get so much from someone yeah
I can't help you if you won't help yourself

You might be twenty-five but in my mind
I see you at sixteen years oh most of the time
And I'm, I'm just a child and you're full grown
And no I'm nothing like I've ever known yeah
You are like nothing that I ever knew
