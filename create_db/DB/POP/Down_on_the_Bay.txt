Ah, sweet little lady
Used to drive me crazy
Had to stick around to play

Down on the bay, that's where I stay
The clouds are gray, down on the bay

And I'm getting so excited
Every time you start to play

Down on the bay, that's where I stay
The clouds are gray, down on the bay
But that's my home
I can't leave my woman alone

Down on the bay, that's where I stay
Down on the bay, that's where I stay

Down on the bay, that's where I stay

Down on the bay, I said, that's where I stay
Down on the bay, that's where I stay

Down on the bay, that's where I stay
Down on the bay, that's where I stay
Down on the bay, alright, that's where I stay

Down on the bay and that's where I
I said, down on the, that's where I
Down on the
