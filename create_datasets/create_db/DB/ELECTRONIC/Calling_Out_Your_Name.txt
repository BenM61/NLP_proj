Feeling Free
U and Me
It me brings me hope again
And brings the love to everything
Water falls fire calls
Bring me home again
And bring the last to everything

Like the Stars shoaring
And dragonflies gloring
Feel your presence in the rain
Mmm... thru the fire dancing
Flies of dragons pass me
Leading me to you

Calling out ur name (x5)

Like the wind blowing in the distance
I'm in da silent trees the voices sets me free
Like the stars... showin me da path I have to take
To you... 

Calling out ur name (x6)
