No need to be afraid
But to yourself be true
You don't have to shy away
From the beauty that is me and you

A love so pure a love so rare
And baby now we've found it
I'm giving you my soul to share
So stand up and be counted

We could spend a lifetime
Never find a love so find
Accept it baby there ain't any other way

Face up to the truth inside baby
Don't be afraid of the truth inside

Nothing more, nothing less
Baby this is right
I'm right here waiting, just say yes
And come on up to paradise

We could spend a lifetime
Never find a love so fine
Accept it baby there ain't any other way

Face up to the truth inside baby
Don't be afraid of the truth inside
