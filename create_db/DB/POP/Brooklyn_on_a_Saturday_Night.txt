Some they come for the dance
And some they come for the fight
Either way take your chance
In Brooklyn on a Saturday night

Yeah, that's how they happened to meet
When they met, it was right
Fell right in with the beat
In Brooklyn on a Saturday night

He had nothing much planned
She was there with a man
But when he saw her,
He couldn't ignore her

The whole thing just got out of hand
On Saturday night
It happened out in
Brooklyn on a Saturday night

Saturday night, yeah
Talkin' 'bout
Brooklyn on a Saturday night
Saturday night, yeah

Oh, she meant to be good
And oh, he tried to do right
But things got misunderstood
In Brooklyn on a Saturday night

He ended up having some words
With that punk
Who brought her there first
She came between them,

A sharp blade was seen
And she ended face down in the dirt
On Saturday night
It happened out

In Brooklyn on a Saturday night
Saturday night, yeah
Talkin' bout
Brooklyn on a Saturday night

Saturday night, yeah
Yeah, some they come for the dance
And some they come for the fight
Either way take your chance

In Brooklyn on a Saturday night
No
Oh No
Saturday night

Happened out in
Brooklyn on a Saturday night
Saturday night
Talkin' bout

Brooklyn on a Saturday night
Saturday night, yeah
