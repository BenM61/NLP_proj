Two time loser
Two times I'm a loser
Two time loser
All because I tried to play the game

Once I had me a sweet girl
Oh boy, what a neat little girl
I didn't know how much she really cared for me
So now I what real trouble can be

I played around with one of her friends
I didn't know just what I was gettin' into
I acted a fool and told her friend I dug her
And I came on like the world's sweetest lover

Now I'm a two time loser
Two times I'm a loser
Two time loser
All because I tried to play the game
As I want to lose you, baby

Once I got you back I'll never let you go again
I've made a mistake for the very last time now
My baby, please, give me some kind of sign
I want to know if you will ever love me again
Now baby, I want to be more than your friend

Other fellows can play the fool
This time, darling, I'm gonna keep my cool
'Cause two times I'm a loser
Two times I'm a loser, baby
Two times
