You can sleep forever, but still you will be tired
You can stay as cold as stone, but still you won't find peace
With you I feel I'm the meek leading the blind
With you I feel I'm just spending wasting time

I've been waiting
I'm still waiting
I've been waiting
I've been waiting
I've been waiting
I'm still waiting
I'm with you (with you)
It's always one step too far
One step too far

You can walk too far but still you won't be found
You can look down on the world but still you won't find love
You won't find love

Only with mellow
Are you thin enough to slide through
Don't let nothin' ride you
If the sun or the moon would give way to doubt
They would immediately go out
Only one swallow doesn't make a summer
But you gotta start somewhere (maxi's bit)

I've been waiting
I'm still waiting
I've been waiting
I've been waiting
I've been waiting
I'm still waiting
I'm with you (with you)
It's always one step too far
One step too far

I've been waiting
I'm still waiting
I've been waiting
I've been waiting
I've been waiting
I'm still waiting
I'm with you (with you)
It's always one step too far
One step too far
