Tender Falls The Rain
Tender falls the rain 
As I speak your name 
And what it means to me
Tender falls the tears 
As I think of all the years
And all the joy we shared

Leaving me this way
there's just no more words to say
Except I love you baby
I still love you baby

I guess I couldn't see 
Just what you mean to me
Until the rain began

Tender falls the light 
As I hold our pillow tight
In place of you dear
Gently calms the pain
As I call out your name
He no longer hears
No longer hears

Leaving me this way
there's just no more words to say
Except I'm sorry baby
I'm so so sorry baby
I guess I couldn't see 
Just what you mean to me 
Until the rain began

Leaving me this way 
there's just no more words to say
Except I love you baby
I still love you baby

Deep inside I know 
This love vould grow and grow
Forever more

Tender falls the rain
Tender falls the rain
