It's five A.M. and I'm on the radio
I'm supposed to call you, but I don't know what to say at all
And there's this girl, she wants me to take her home
She don't really love me though, I'm just on the radio

And I'm not gonna tell you that I'm over it
'Cause I think about it every night I'm not sober, and
I know I keep these feelings to myself
Like I don't need nobody else
But you're not the only one on my mind

If I'm being honest
If I'm being honest
You said I should be honest
So I'm being honest

It's six A.M., I'm so far away from you
I don't wanna let you down, what am I supposed to do?
It's been three weeks at least, now, since I've been gone
And I don't even like the road, I'm just on the radio

And I'm not gonna tell you that I'm over it
'Cause I think about it every night I'm not sober, and
I know I keep these feelings to myself
Like I don't need nobody else
But you're not the only one on my mind

If I'm being honest
If I'm being honest
You said I should be honest
So I'm being honest

And I'm not gonna tell you that I'm over it
'Cause I think about it every night I'm not sober, and
I know I keep these feelings to myself
Like I don't need nobody else
But you're not the only one on my mind

If I'm being honest
If I'm being honest
You said I should be honest
So I'm being honest

If I'm being honest
