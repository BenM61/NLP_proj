One night in heaven. One night in heaven.
One night in heaven. One night in heaven.
One night in heaven. One night in heaven.
One night in heaven. One night in heaven.

Sometimes I get to thinking, while you are far away,
just how much I miss you and how time it ticks away.
So sad when we are fighting, too much tension too much hate.
Sometimes I need reminding, before it gets too late.
Just one moment in my day. 
Take me up to a place so far in your heavenly space.

One night (one night), one night in heaven. When you touch me
You take me up high with the clouds in the sky.
One night (one night), one night in heaven. When you kiss me
You light up my life, make me feel so alive.

While people create problems, lie cheat in vain,
Come lay with me in my bed and wash away the pain.
Take me on a journey let the pleasure start.
Take me on a journey that leads straight to your heart.
Just one look I can see in your face,
You're my love satellite in orbit with you.
Such a beautiful place.

One night (one night), one night in heaven. When you touch me
You take me up high with the clouds in the sky.
One night (one night), one night in heaven. When you kiss me
You light up my life, make me feel so alive.

Just give me one night. Just give me one night. 
Just give me one night. Just give me one night.
Ooh I'm in heaven baby. Ooh I'm in heaven baby. 
Ooh I'm in heaven baby. Ooh I'm in heaven baby. 

One night (one night), one night in heaven. When you touch me
You take me up high with the clouds in the sky.
One night (one night), one night in heaven. When you kiss me
You light up my life, make me feel so alive.
