You didn't care, you went and broke my heart
I'll get you back, you know it's gonna start
You gave me pain, look what you've done to me
When I get through you'll be sorry you met me

You'll wish you were never born
Blackmail, blackmail
I'll make you pay for the life that you tore
Blackmail, blackmail

You put it to me and now we'll play my game
I'll wrap you up and you'll go insane
It took so long and I waited my turn
You pay your debt, I'm gonna make you burn, you know

You'll wish you were never born
Blackmail, blackmail
I'll make you pay for the life that you tore
Blackmail, blackmail

I know about you and I'm gonna tell
The way I planned, you're gonna go through hell
You listen to what I'm about to say
Or you won't live to see the light of day, you know

You'll wish you were never born
Blackmail, blackmail
I'll make you pay for the life that you tore
Blackmail, blackmail

One more time, blackmail, blackmail
