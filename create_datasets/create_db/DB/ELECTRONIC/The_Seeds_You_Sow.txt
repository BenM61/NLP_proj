Oh, there was a time when I was caught up in you
It was a question of time
I was hooked on the line but I was dragging you, too
All I wanted was mine

All I know if I was to do it again
I wouldn't believe that I was harming you
But I really should go, 
I should just leave you alone
I should just leave you alone 

These are the seeds you sow
These are the seeds you sow 

Oh, it seems like the clocks, 
They don't know when to stop
It's just a matter of time
I wasn't ready to choose, 
No, there's nothing for you
All I wanted was mine

All I know if I was to do it again
I wouldn't believe that I was harming you
Well, I really should go, 
I should just leave you alone
I should just leave you alone 

These are the seeds you sow
These are the seeds you sow 
These are the seeds you sow

I should just leave you alone
I should just leave you alone
These are the seeds you sow

And I watched your heart break
And there is nothing above you
Now that I am awake
I would say anything
Saying all those words, 
They were never enough
I would say anything
Just to tell you I was here rough

Oh, these are the seeds you sow
These are the seeds you sow 
These are the seeds you sow

I should just leave you alone
I should just leave you alone
These are the seeds you sow

Oh, there was a time when I was caught up in you
