On a wagon bound for market,
There's a calf with a mournful eye
High above him there's a swallow 
Winging swiftly through the sky

How the winds are laughing
They laugh with all their might
Laugh and laugh the whole day through 
And half of the summer's night
Donna Donna Donna Donna Donna Donna Donna Don
Donna Donna Donna Donna Donna Donna Donna Don

Stop complaining said the farmer
Who told you a calf to be 
Why don't you have wings to fly with
Like the swallow so proud and free

How the winds are laughing
They laugh with all their might
Laugh and laugh the whole day through 
And half of the summer's night
Donna Donna Donna Donna Donna Donna Donna Don
Donna Donna Donna Donna Donna Donna Donna Don

Calves are easily bound and slaughtered
Never knowing the reason why 
Those who love and cherish freedom
Like the swallow will learn to fly

How the winds are laughing
They laugh with all their might
Laugh and laugh the whole day through 
And half of the summer's night
Donna Donna Donna Donna Donna Donna Donna Don
Donna Donna Donna Donna Donna Donna Donna Don
