Run up if you will get yo ass whipped blue black
My nigga my nerve, fresh out the curb
Jelly jammin' preserve, nothin' but mossin' my word
And a mossberg pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
What eva' my nigga 'cause young niggas still dyin'
Hollin' bout huh, nigga what, huh, giv a f*ck nigga what
Full of that weed, lick it like a popsicle, a slanted and a janted
Have a nigga named young bleed party on, in the jungle,
Where the murder million mumble for months and dayz
Trippin' off these blunts we blaze, hellin' for high
And tellin' em' why, I'm a neva say die, see it my eyes
And niggas say I fly like a eagle, see no evil
And ain't no sequel to this here, this year I'm bailin' in tha doe
Super natural, wit ends, ya'll niggas don't here me though
But see how they runnin' everythang on tha cool
But they know I'm fittin' to act a fool in this muthafucka

These niggas they'll take you, hustlin' is a habit
Young bread cabbage, popcorn and grits nigga tryin' to get a rabbit

Painted to ride in, niggas flip change in tha game 'cause we soldiers
Eyes of a red 'cause a nigga blowin' doujah
Tired of black shoe strangs, tight on tha reeboks
Grab yo ski mask, dkny, I mean a plastic glock
Hoes bounce that ass, niggas get dealt wit
Keep yo enemy tight, nigga neva thank quick
Over some liquir to tha homies I own, r.i.p. to every fuckin' rapper

Fo' a dollar bill

Please mama may I, go out and be a playa, sippin' on hennesy
A million bitches want me, my nigga passed tha herb, I took a token,
I'm stayin' true, 'cause what eva' he down wit I'm down wit it too
So don't get full of that alcohol in tha club and thank you bad
