3 hearts in a tangle, wheels start to turn
Someone meets someone, & someone gets burned
One loves the money, two loves the show
Three's always ready, you can't say no

3 hearts in a tangle
Someone's in the dark
You stay together, can't live apart
3 hearts in a tangle
I can't tell a lie
3 hearts in a tangle, nobody's right...

Two hearts in a tangle, now somebody's sad
There's always a back door if you want to be bad
Yeah 3 hearts in a tangle, the third time around
Somebody gets restless, I'm doin' it now

3 hearts in a tangle
The knot is tied
I'm caught in the middle

Two hearts in tangle, one of them's you
Fingers are pointing, now who is the fool
Yeah one is out playin', & one waits at home
No one gets even, you're all left alone

3 hearts in a tangle
Such a hard thing to fight
Somebody's suspicious, yeah
Where did you spend the night?
3 hearts in a tangle
I can't tell a lie
3 hearts in a tangle, nobody's right...
