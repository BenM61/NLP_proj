Am I the snake inside your garden
The sugar in your tea
The knock upon your back door
The twist that turns your key
Am I the sweat you feel on your head
The shadow on your face
The tune inside your head that put you here in the first place
Well I don't want to be
I don't want to be
I don't want to be your sweet temptation
I don't want to be your new sensation
It's just a delicate distraction
With just a hint of satisfaction
Look me in the eye and let me know
If you can't love me that let me go
Let me go
Let me go

Do you try to stay suspended
In your deepest fantasy
After night has ended
The scent of mystery
The power of suggestion
Tangles up your soul
A neutral state between love and hate
Is bound to take its toll
Well I don't think you know
I don't think you know
I don't think you know about the screaming
You don't understand the meaning
You could trade it in for laughter
To keep your happy ever after
Look me in the eye and let me know
If you can't love me then let me go
Let me go
Let me go

Baby in your ivory tower
Do you sleep tight dream fight
Baby does it wet your appetite
Maybe in your darkest hour
Am I the keeper of your beast
Well I don't want to be
I don't want to be
So let me go
Let me go
