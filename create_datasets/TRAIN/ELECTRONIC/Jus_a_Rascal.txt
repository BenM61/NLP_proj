Yo London stand up tall

Stress on the brain, complain too the fool
Stress on the brain complain too the max
I'm gonna search for big money stacks, top tens and platinum whacks
Ain't got no need for a chain of a chaks
I'm a rude boi I ain't gotta relax
I got this game in my head like dax

Got this game in my hand, be cool
I'll stop a bull, make a boi relax
I'll take teeth for the money and jaks
We make money off album tracks
Come on I'll face it, lets all face facts
You may be some handsome chaps
What's that, but I'm invisible to all
Foolish fakish cats, Roll Deep will have some of that

Jus another brain complain to the max
Jus another brain complain to the low
Gotta get money, got get a lot of ho
No less than a G for the show
ain't got no buff or I'll hang dudes who think I hang wit the low
I get round all ways in a go, I get round all ways in a rush
I won't eva hush, drinking beer make my lot lush
When I come to the crotch with crush, never chat shit, talk shit get flushed
I talk tough 'cause life's been rough
gritty, shitty life ain't been to pretty far from buff
so I'm off to the elegant stuff
