Huddled in this acid nation, 
With apprehension, 
You are expected 
To gulp down hindrance 

Huddled in this acid nation, 
With apprehension, 
You are expected 
To gulp down hindrance

This is a celebration of, 
Spirit and of mind.
When your body's resignation, 
Is heard you can't ignore

This is an acid nation.
We will persevere.
This is an acid nation.
We will persevere.

Feel the rays beat down! 
Feel the rays beat down! 

Next time you open your eyes, 
Be thankful the world, 
Never wears a disguise, 
Here's the sun to reveal

This is an acid nation, 
We will persevere.
This is an acid nation, 
We will persevere.

Feel the rays beat down! 
Feel the rays beat down! 

And anyway who cares?
The sun is out

So
Stare at the sun.
Stare at the sun.

This is everything I ever wanted.
This is everything I ever wanted.
This is everything I ever wanted.

This feeling's all I need.
