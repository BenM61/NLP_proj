Used to be that 
I believed in something
Used to be that
I believed in love
It's been a long time
Since I had that feeling
I could love someone
I could trust someone
I said I never let nobody
Near my heart again, darlin'
I said I never let nobody in

But if you asked me to
I just might change my mind
And let you in my life forever
If you asked me to
I just might give my heart
And stay here in your arms forever
If you asked me to
If you asked me to

Somehow ever since 
I been around you
Can't go back to being
On my own
Can't help feeling, darling
Since I found you
That I found my home
That I'm finally home
I said I never let nobody
Get to close to me, darling
I said I needed
Needed to be free

But if you asked me to
I just might change my mind
And let you in my life forever
If you asked me to
I just might give my heart
And stay here in your arms forever
If you asked me to
If you asked me to

Ask me to and I will give my world
To you baby
I need you now
Ask me to and I'll do anything
For you baby
For you baby
I'll let you in my life forever
All you gotta do is ask me to
And I'll give you my world
I'll give you my heart
I'll give you anything
Just ask me, baby
Oh, I'll do anything you want me to 
Just ask me, yes
All you gotta do is ask me to
If you asked me to
I'll change my mind
