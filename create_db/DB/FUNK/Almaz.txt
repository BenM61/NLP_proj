She only smiles, he only tells her
That she's the flowers the wind and spring
In all her splendor, sweetly surrendering
The love that Innocence brings

Almaz, pure and simple,
born in a world where love survives
Now men will want her, cause life don't haunt her
Almaz, you lucky, lucky thing
Now I watch closely, and I watch wholely
I can't imagine love so rare
She's young and tender, but will life bend her 
I look around is she everywhere

He throws her kisses, she shares his wishes
I'm sure he's king without a doubt
With love so captive, so solely captive
I ask if I could play the part
