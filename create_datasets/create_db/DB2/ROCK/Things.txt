Elsewhere in the temple the llamas are gearing up
To assault a tiger mountain when the sun comes up

We sat around whispering in the candle light
Missing a game plan for the night
Learning about the difference between north and south
Keep a gun in your pocket and your tongue in your mouth

You'd be doing it (doing the thing)
Doing it (doing the thing)
Doing it (doing the thing)
The thing you'd do in Denver when you're dead

A month is a Saturday, Wednesday is a week
I saw the way you looked at her Charlie Brown good grief
She pulled you into the shadows and taught you how to love
Patted you on the head and gave you a shove

And you were doing it (doing the thing)
Doing it (doing the thing)
Doing it (doing the thing)
The thing you do in Denver when you're dead

The sexual exuberance of a concubine checks my carburetor one more time
With the passion of a thorough-bread and the sensitivity of a moose
I rarely make a move unless I've got some proof

That I'll be doing it (doing the thing)
Doing it (doing the thing)
Doing it (doing the thing)
The thing you do in Denver when you're dead

You live in Paris, I live in France
Things are expensive when you live first class
I learnt Latin, you learnt Greek
When you've got a minute let's meet in Crete

We'll be doing it (doing the thing)
Doing it (doing the thing)
Doing it (doing the thing)
The thing you do in Denver when you're dead

Doing it in Denver when you're dead
