I know a girl laying down
She's sleeping weeks at a time
And when she wakes up she watches TV
Counting cracks in the ceiling

No, I don't know what she's thinking
So I give up waiting for someone, waiting
Talking to someone, staring

I never come around
I never come around
I left her fifteen years behind
Girl's laying down
Never come around

So much for girl staying
In afraid of being needed
And seen she watches
The world on a screen

She's distant
And God knows I tried to leave her
'Cause she's got a constant fever
I let it slip my mind

I never come around
I never come around
I left her fifteen years behind

I know a girl laying down
No, I never wasted my time
We have something in common
She's as different as I am
