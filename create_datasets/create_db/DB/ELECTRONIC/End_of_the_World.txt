I said it was just a Monday
But it was the Tuesday
It was every single week day
You took me out your arms
Yeah you took me out your arms
I said it was just a Wednesday
But it was the Thursday
It even went through to Sunday
You took away the past
Yeah you took away our past

I won't try to lie
You can tell by my face
There's a reason why
I won't try to lie
Is there any way out for me this time
I won't try to lie
You can tell by my face
There's a reason why
I won't try to lie
There isn't any way out for me this time

Tonight is the end of the world, the end of the world
The end of the world for me and you
It's the end of the world, the end of the world
I am gonna be crash and burned
You are gonna be crash and burned
We are just gonna have to learn, we are just gonna have to learn
It's the end of the world, it's the end of the world

You said it was just a one kiss
How could you be so heartless?
But it was more than just a friendship
I took you out my arms
Yeah I took you out my arms
You said it was just a one time
You thought that it would be fine
But you never even realized
I took away the past
Yeah I took away our past

I won't try to lie
You can tell by my face
There's a reason why
I won't try to lie
Is there any way out for me this time
I won't try to lie
You can tell by my face
There's a reason why
I won't try to lie
There isn't any way out for me this time

Tonight is the end of the world, the end of the world
The end of the world for me and you
It's the end of the world, the end of the world
I am gonna be crash and burned
You are gonna be crash and burned
We are just gonna have to learn, we are just gonna have to learn
It's the end of the world, it's the end of the world

It's the end of the world, the end of the world
The end of the world for me and you
It's the end of the world, the end of the world
I am gonna be crash and burned
You are gonna be crash and burned
We are just gonna have to learn, we are just gonna have to learn
It's the end of the world, it's the end of the world

This is the end of the world
This is the end of the world
This is the end of the world
This is the end of the world
This is the end of the world
This is the end of the world
This is the end of the world
This is the end of the world

You said it was just a one kiss
How could you be so heartless?
But it was more than just a friendship
I took you out my arms
Yeah I took you out my arms
