Ooh, I was a lonely cloud
I was a leaf that had to fall to the ground
I was a coloured red by the oceanic time
I went down, down so sublime-sublime

Can they explain why it hurts in our brains?
(With my landslide companion)
Why we all yearn for some biblical disaster?
(Rocks and Bones!)
Me and the cannibal's volountary prey
(A cannibal)
Ain't looking for a friend, we are looking for a Master
(Or anyone who can)

Deliver us from free will
Deliver us from free will
Deliver us and free our minds from thought

Deliver us from free will
Deliver us from free will
Deliver us and free our minds from thought
Deliver us now!

Ooh, I was a Jabba the Hut slut
Cut to the next frame, do it again
I was a B-flat conqueror, cat to comb
With all the no-no-no of nursery bones

Say can you see who will sleep well at night
(Are you sleeping?)
In a world that's a-flame and is changing much faster
(A-changing, a-changing)
Give us a reason to fall to the ground
(A miracle!)
Or give us the drugs so we all can get plastered forever
Forever!

Deliver us from free will
Deliver us from free will
Deliver us and free our minds from thought

Deliver us from free will
Deliver us from free will
Don't wanna know what tomorrow will bring
I need a thing I can hold on and cling to forever... Forever!

Deliver us from free will
Deliver us from free will
Deliver us and free our minds from thought

Deliver us from free will
Deliver us from free will
Deliver us and free our minds from thought
Oh, deliver us now!
