When the day is over 
And the work is done 
Well it's a different story 
As the darkness comes around 
I tried to let you know 
You're going the wrong way 

And the streets you thought 
Would all be paved with gold 
But when the wind cuts through 
You'd even try to sell your soul 
Everywhere you go 
It's the long way 

Now you're no longer 
Just the boy next door 
When they were falling in love 
With that clean cut smile 
Change of style 
Just for a little while 
 
Whatcha doing, hey whatcha doing 
Walking through danger 
Can't see the wrong or the right 
Whatcha doing, tell me whatcha doing 
Can't be a stranger 
Must be a trick of the night 

Well its a laugh a minute 
And you can't decide 
Between the burning question 
And the fortune in his eyes 
You never let it show 
Or take it the wrong way 

Sometimes you wonder 
What you came here for 
Oh, they could tear you apart 
With those bare faced lies 
Can't disguise 
All the hurt you're feeling inside 

Whatcha doing, hey whatcha doing 
Walking through danger 
Can't see the wrong or the right 
Whatcha doing, tell me whatcha doing 
Can't be a stranger 
Must be a trick of the night 

Whatcha doing, hey whatcha doing 
Walking through danger 
Can't see the wrong or the right 
Whatcha doing, tell me whatcha doing 
Can't be a stranger 
Must be a trick of the night 

Of the night, of the night 
Must be a trick of the night 

When the day is over 
And the work is done 
Well it's a different story 
As the darkness comes around 

And the streets you thought 
Would all be paved with gold 
But when the wind cuts through 
You'd even try to sell your soul
