There will never be another love for you and me

Real love where do you come from
Real love lead the way
Real love where do you come from
Real love stay with me
Stay with me.

I need you baby, like the birds need to sing
I want you always, I cherish everything.

You do for me, babe you set me free
It's you and me, for eternity.

When your arms surround me
And you smother me in your sweet love
We let tender kisses looses on one another.
We're not living in the shadow of someone we could be
There's no pretending, when we're together all there is

Is honesty, babe you set me free
It's you and me, for eternity.
I need you baby, and I know you need me too
We were meant to be togehter 
There's something special in the

Things that we do, it's me and you 
We're stuck like glue, 'cause this love is true
