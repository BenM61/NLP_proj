Please be careful is never careful
Till it hears the gun
She will always pay the bills
For the having big fun
He talks so well, what can you do,
It's pretty plain he means it too
I don't want to sell you lines,
I only mean to do you right
But I'm a simple slave of appetite,
I'm a poor slave of appetite

Hunger howls, hungers red,
Hungers stays till it's fed
Then it some h-h-how fades,
Then it somehow leaves your sight
Depending on it's appetite,
Depending on your appetite

So if you take - Then put back good
If you steal - be Robin Hood
If your eyes are wanting all you see
Then I think I'll name you after me
I think I'll call you appetite

Here she is with two small problems
And the best part of the blame
Wishes she could call him heartache
But it's not a boy's name

If you grow up to be, just like him, just like me
You're fighting for exclusive rights,
For honeymoons each sleepless night
In which case I'll call you appetite
Yes I think I'll call you appetite

So if you take - Then put back good
If you steal - be Robin Hood
If your eyes are wanting all you see
Then I think I'll name you after me
I think I'll call you appetite

So if you take - Then put back good
If you steal - be Robin Hood
If your eyes are wanting all you see
Then I think I'll name you after me
I think I'll call you appetite

Then I think I'll name you after me
I think I'll call you appetite
