See I've been thinkin' it over
It's all just a little too much
See I've got this four leaf clover
It's gotta bring a little luck
Yeah, uh huh (it's got the best of me)
Yeah, uh huh

So I let go of all of the big deals
I let go of the bitter dream
You see the girl in the pretty white picture
Is never what it ever seems
yeah, uh huh 
yeah, uh huh

My mind is always racin' 
And my body's on overload
She got my hear in the middle 
In the middle of a feelin'
I got no place to go
Yeah, uh huh

See i've been thinking it over
It's all just a little too much
See I got a four leaf clover
It's gotta bring a little luck

I'm runnin' 
But I got nowhere to be
And I'm alright 

I'm runnin'
It's got the best of me
And it's alright

See i've been thinking it over
It's all just a little too much
See i've got this four leaf cloer
It's gotta bring a little luck (oh yeah)
