I feel like walking, because my poor hearts breaking
You told me once I know, but loves a thing that can go
Vanish in the night, its gone by morning's light
It drifted in one day - but I'm hoping it will
Stay - in my arms always, never go away
I'll make this moment last and put time in the past
Where time alone can stop - stop me thinking

Walking the night - I'm wondering if I'm gonna see you again
You left me standing by wracked with wondering
Why I feel so insecure, yes a mad thing I know
but I can't help myself, shake this feeling off
Lets start getting back - to where we started

From the difference that I felt - I thought I knew myself
I thought I knew so well - now time alone will tell
If we can make time stop - and keep this feeling
