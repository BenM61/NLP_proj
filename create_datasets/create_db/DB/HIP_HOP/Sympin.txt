Baby let me tell you about how I feel 
This urge is seizing me, controlling it's unreal 
Ooh, ahh baby, I want to let you know 
You got me yearning, so baby let me show 
Ooh, I want you baby, gotta let you know I need ya here with me 
This ain't the right way, gotta find another way to earn your love 
Just give me a clue cause you know... 

[Chorus:]
Sympin' ain't easy, get on your hands and knees and lift your eyebrows 
Sympin' ain't easy, and if you want to get it, then you gotta be willing 
To cry and beg and plead on your knees 

Pardon my expression (You're excused) 
But the feeling I have is so strong 
I guess you know this isn't easy to do 
I keep trying and trying to give my love to you 
Ooh, I want you baby, gotta let you know I need ya here with me 
This ain't the right way, gotta find another way to earn your love 
Just give me a clue cause you know... 

[Chorus]
