Come on, Check it out, ya'll
(Come on, come on!) 

Check it out, the tribal dance 
Feel the force, this is your chance 
To get control and do the tribal dance 

People started dancing a long time ago 
The bass was fast, but then again it was slow
Soul, house, rhythm and blues 
It doesn't matter what music you choose
Strike up a dance, is your chance 
To come with me and do the tribal dance 
You've got to move it with a temperature
Into the rhythm that the fire burns
So get into it-- get into the trance
This is the rhythm of the tribal dance, the tribal dance

It started with a tribe who discovered the vibe
Who moved to the rhythm just the way they liked
You hear the treble, you hear the bass
The are-a-why, yeah is on the case
Feel the fire, feel the flame
Do your thing now, don't be ashamed
I have to go now, no offense
I've hooked you up into the tribal dance

Get into it 
Get into it
Get into the trance
You've got to do the tribal dance

Check it out (come on!) 
Take your chance! 
Check it out (come on!) 
Take your chance! 
Check it out (come on!) 
Take your chance! 

Tribal dance! Tribal dance, tribal dance! 
Yeah! Oh! Tribal dance! Tribal dance! 
You've got to move it with a temperature, 
Into the rhythm that the fire burns! 

So get into it, get into the trance
This is the rhythm of the tribal dance, the tribal dance
