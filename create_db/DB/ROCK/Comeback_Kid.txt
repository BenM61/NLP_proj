King Pin on a cutback
King Pin on a cutback
With sunken eyes

Big cheese in a bedsit
Big cheese in a bedsit
And shit the sky

Slick move you said you wanna try me
You should've left it just where you found it
I see you creeping, thinking what it could be
You'll have to trust me, just don't believe me

Reap what you sow
Comeback Kid
Says hello

Here, here we stand
Side by side
Don't let go (of my hand)

Sasquatch in a bin bag
Sasquatch in a bin bag
It's no suprise

Nosebleed in a pound shop
Nosebleed in a pound shop
Spitting flies

Slick move you said you wanna try me
You should've left it just where you found it
My single life about to hypnotise you
Now here it comes, I just wanna hold you

Reap what you sow
Comeback Kid
Says hello

Here, here we stand
Side by side
Don't let go (of my hand)

Back when you know you shoulda sent to do it on a mission
You were the only one who said you'd stay if you could have it
I guess you want it, guess you want it, guess you want it
I guess you want it, guess you want it, guess you want it
I still don't know if you do want it, do you want it, do you?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it, do you?

Reap what you sow
Comeback Kid
Says hello

And here, here we stand
Side by side
Don't let go

Reap what you sow
Comeback Kid
Says hello

And here, here we stand
Side by side
Don't let go
