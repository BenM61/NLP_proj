Give me a potion to make me love you
Give me a potion to make me care
Give me a potion to make me love you
Make it a double, make it a double

Below the ocean, I make my bed down there
Below the ocean, I got to live somewhere
Maybe the graveyard, and maybe I don't care

Why can't love be blind?
Instead of just a blind man crying
Why can't love be, why can't love be blind?

Thanks for the potion to make me love you
Thanks for the potion to make me care
Your charms are working on me
Your charms are working hard
Your charms are working on me
Your charms are working hard

Thanks for the potion to make me love you
Make it a double, make it a double
