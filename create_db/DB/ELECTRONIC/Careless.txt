I don't care what you say 
You mean nothing to me 
I don't care what you say, I don't care what you do 
You mean nothing to me 
And I say it 'cause I'm not afraid 
I don't care what you say, I don't care what you do 
You mean nothing to me, I got nothing to prove 

I don't care, I don't care
What you say, what you say 
What you say, I don't care

Lose all control 
When you're not here 
The air is so cold 
Where you appear 
Don't care what you say 
Don't care what you do 
'Cause in my own way 
I got nothing to prove 

I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care what you say
