You came into my life
When I was lost and all alone
With no one to call my own
You made me feel alive again

I've been in love before
And you're more than just a friend
I never thought that I would love again
But my heart is burnin' for you

Your love is full of fire
Burnin', only you I desire
Your love is full of fire
Can't stop this raging fire, hot

Filled with so much love
And lots of understanding
Oh, this passion is everlasting
Without you there could be no me

The warmth of your embrace
It really set my soul aflame
Girl, we're passed the point of playin' games
It's just a spark that will burn forever

Your love is full of fire, got me burnin'
Burnin', only you I desire
Your love is full of fire
Can't stop this raging fire

You got me wanting, got me wanting
Got me wanting you, baby
You got me wanting, got me wanting you, forever

You got me wanting, got me wanting
Got me wanting you, baby
You got me wanting, you got me, got me

Got me full of fire
Got me full of fire
Got me full of fire
Got me full of fire

Baby, your love is full of fire
My love is burnin', burnin'
Burnin' only you I desire

Your love is full of fire
You know I can't stop
Can't stop this raging fire

Your love is what it takes
To make me forget past mistakes
If I had known that you'd be comin' my way
You would have spared me so much heartache

Girl, I'm glad you realize
That from now until the end of time
I'm gonna claim you to be mine
We got a love that lasts forever, you and I together, baby

Your love is full of fire, got me burnin'
Burnin', only you I desire
Your love is full of fire
Can't stop this raging fire

You got me wanting, got me wanting
Got me wanting you, baby
You got me wanting, got me wanting you, forever

You got me wanting, got me wanting
Got me wanting you, baby
You got me wanting, got me

Got me burnin' with desire, full of fire
Boy, you're full of fire, fire
Got me, temperature is higher, full of fire
Can't stop this raging fire

Your love is full of fire, got me burnin'
Burnin', only you I desire
Your love is full of fire
I can't stop

No need in denyin'
Ain't no way of hidin'
Your love, your love

Burnin' with desire
Love is full of fire
Our love, our love

Your love is full of fire
Burnin'
Your love is full of fire
Can't stop

Got me full of fire
Got me full of fire

Your love is full of fire
Burnin'
Your love is full of fire
Can't stop
