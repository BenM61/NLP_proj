You've seen him
In the undirected light of street dreams
Doing nothing
Standing, like to seem casual
With a resemblance to people held by fear
Lit by fire and disrepair
The blue millionaire

Don't listen and keep asking
Only stories reach this far
No one's left and no one's coming
And I will disappear far away from you
The American wind and the blue millionaire

Blue millionaire
Blue millionaire

There is no such thing as the wrong man
Blue as the dusk that ended my day and shut off the light and air
I wish I could tell you
How he put them in cages
Found you where you slept
Got me down with something else than bruises
Tied me to a blue chair
Lit by fire and disrepair
The blue millionaire

Blue millionaire
Blue millionaire
Blue millionaire
Blue millionaire

Seen him drinking gin from pale blue bottles
Drowning in shadow
Shadows moving in
Forever imagine
Imagine it's him
Nearby the window
With dreams broken in

I don't laugh anymore or smile
I am lost in the body, the passion of time
He is screening my dreams and everything that's mine
Don't stay in this mirror other hands have left me in
You don't blow away as I do
It will be the same again
Turn and point away from here
Steal what you cannot win
From the blue millionaire

Blue millionaire
Blue millionaire
Blue millionaire
Blue millionaire

Blue millionaire
Blue millionaire
Blue millionaire
