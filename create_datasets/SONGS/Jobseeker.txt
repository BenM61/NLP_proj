Jobseeker!

Can of Strongbow, I'm a mess
Desperately clutching onto a leaflet on depression
Supplied to me by the NHS
Is anyone's guess how I got here?
Anyone's guess how I go?
I suck on a roll-up - pull your jeans up -
F*** off, I'm going home

So Mr. Williamson, what have you done to find gainful employment
Since your last signing on date?
F*** all
I've been sat around the house wanking,
And I want to know why you don't serve coffee here
My signing on time is supposed to be ten past eleven
It's now twelve o'clock
And some of you smelly bastards need executing

Mr. Williamson your employment history looks quite impressive
I'm looking at three managerial positions you previously held with quite
Reputable companies, isn't this something you'd like to go back to?
Nah, I'd just end up robbing the f***ing place,
You've got a till full of twenties staring at you all day,
I'm hardly going to bank it???
