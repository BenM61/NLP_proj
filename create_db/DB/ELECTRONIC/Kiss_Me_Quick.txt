Kiss me quick
Hot and right
No confusion
Paradise
Never panic
We're alone
Kiss me quick
There's the phone

Lips that taste of cigarettes and California wine
Lips that taste of fancy food, you drive me out of my mind
I really wish you'd kiss me one more time

Kiss me quick
Melt the ice
College ideas
High school eyes
Paramedic
Dressed in white
Kiss me quick
Save my life

Lips that taste of foreign words and complimentary lies
Lips that make a nervous wreck of any normal guy
I really wish you'd kiss me one more time

Kiss me quick
Wake me up
Caffeine kisses
Not enough
Jungle fever
Insect bites
Weird religions
Pagan rites

Lips that taste of cigarettes and California wine
Lips that taste of fancy food, you drive me out of my mind
I really wish you'd kiss me one more time
