Son she said
Have I got a little story for you
What you thought was your daddy
Was nothin' but a fool

While you were sittin'
Home alone at age thirteen
Your real father was dyin'
Sorry you didn't see him
But I'm glad we talked,

Oh I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey, hey, I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey I, oh, I'm still alive

Oh she walks slowly
Across a young man's room
She said I'm ready, for you
I can't remember anything
To this very day
'Cept the look, yeah the look
Oh, you know where

Now I can't see, I just stare
I, I, I'm still alive
Yeah, yeah I, oh, I'm still alive
Yeah, yeah I, oh, I'm still alive
Yeah, yeah I, oh, I'm still alive

Is something wrong
She said
Of course there is
You're still alive
She said
Oh do I deserve to be?
And is that the question? Oh
And if so, if so
Who answers?
Who answers?

I, I, I'm still alive
Yeah, yeah I, oh, I'm still alive
I'm still alive

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
