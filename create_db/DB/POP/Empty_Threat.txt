Tore a line in the sun
Like there's nothing to regret and nothing to prove
Set my sights high enough
So I see the turning tides are parting for you

Taking back an empty threat
More than you could ever know
Take it back with no regrets
I was better off when I was on your side
And I was holding on

To try and not forget
Hoping that you'd never know
Take it back with no regrets
I was better off when I was on your side
And I was holding on

No more times second guessed
Like there's nothing to forget and nothing to lose
Hold my ground long enough
Till I see the turning tides are coming from you

Taking back an empty threat
More than you could ever know
Take it back with no regrets
I was better off when I was on your side
And I was holding on

To try and not forget
Hoping that you'd never know
Take it back with no regrets
I was better off when I was on your side

If we wanna stay here, can we see the waves?
They're spilling over us, filling our insides
In the rising water, in the rising tides
They're spilling over me, filling my insides
If we wanna stay here, can we see the waves?
They're spilling over us, filling our insides
In the rising water, in the rising tides
We wait for the fall
(I gotta tell you)

Maybe the water's high
(I gotta tell you)
But I can see the difference
Maybe the water's high
(I gotta tell you)
But I can see the difference (I gotta tell you)
Maybe the water's high
(I gotta tell you)
But I can see the difference (I gotta tell you)
Maybe the water's high
(I gotta tell you)
But I know that this is different

Taking back an empty threat
More than you could ever know
Take it back with no regrets
I was better off when I was on your side
And I was holding on

To try and not forget
Hoping that you'd never know
Take it back with no regrets
I was better off when I was on your side
And I was holding on
