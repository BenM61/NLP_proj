I've spent a lifetime running after you
But listen woman, everything must change
It's time you found yourself some other fool you can blame
You had me figured as the spineless one
Who'd be there waiting when you'd had your fun
But now's the time I feel I should be cool
What a shame, what a shame

Who gets the love that we no longer share?
Who gets to hold you close when I'm not there?
Whose heart is filling up, I'm asking you
Who gets the love?

So many times you said I made you cry
That's not the truth it's just an alibi
And I'm not planning to be number two, won't play your game.
I've often wondered after love has gone
Where do we find the strength to carry on?
And where's that someone that our love supplies
And what's their name? What a shame.

Who gets the love that we no longer share?
Who gets to hold you close when I'm not there?
Whose heart is filling up, I'm asking you
Who gets the love?

Before we give in are we really sure
We're giving love that we don't need no more?
There ain't a chance that we might get together again, oh no

Who gets the love that we no longer share?
Who gets to hold you close when I'm not there?
Whose heart is filling up, I'm asking you
Who gets the love?

Who gets the love that we no longer share?
Who gets to hold you close when I'm not there?
Whose heart is filling up, I'm asking you
Who gets the love?
