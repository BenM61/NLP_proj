It's time, time to do
Something drastic, something new
Right here and right now
We need to find a way, somehow

It's about reaching out, closing up the distance
Instead of hate, celebrate all the ways we're different
I am optimistic, yes, I do believe
We have the power to make this world a better place

But if it's ever gonna change
We gotta come together, me and you
In a mo-oh, woah oh, moment of truth
If it's ever gonna change
We gotta come together, me and you
In a mo-oh, woah oh, moment of truth

Na, na-na-na-na-na
Na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na
Yeah-yo oh, woah-oh, woah-oh-oh
Na, na-na-na-na-na
Na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na
Yeah-yo oh, woah-oh, woah-oh-oh

It's been way too long
We've been singing that same old song
It worked in a certain light
Not really wrong but never quite right

But with a heart and with a dream, and the winds are changing
It's not as hard as it seems if we just embrace it
It's not unrealistic, it's all within my reach
It's up to us to make this world a better place

But if it's ever gonna change
We gotta come together, me and you
In a mo-oh, woah oh, moment of truth
If it's ever gonna change
We gotta come together, me and you
In a mo-oh, woah oh, moment of truth

Na, na-na-na-na-na
Na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na
Yeah-yo oh, woah-oh, woah-oh-oh
Na, na-na-na-na-na
Na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na
Yeah-yo oh, woah-oh, woah-oh-oh

But if it's ever gonna change
We gotta come together, me and you
In a mo-oh, woah oh, moment of truth
If it's ever gonna change
We gotta come together, me and you
In a mo-oh, woah oh, moment of truth

Na, na-na-na-na-na
Na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na
Yeah-yo oh, woah-oh, woah-oh-oh
Na, na-na-na-na-na
Na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na
Yeah-yo oh, woah-oh, woah-oh-oh

Na, na-na-na-na-na
Na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na
Yeah-yo oh, woah-oh, woah-oh-oh
Na, na-na-na-na-na
Na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na
Yeah-yo oh, woah-oh, woah-oh-oh
