Well, there's a brand new place I've founda
Where people go from miles arounda
They come from ev'rywhere and if you drop in there
You might see anyone in towna
 
Going to a go-go
Going to a go-go
Don't you want to go
(a-one more time, yeah!)
I'm going to a go-go
 
Going to a go-go
Going to a go-go
Don't you want to go
(a-one more time, yeah!)
