'Cause I'll be table dancing
This is your chance
To be with me and you will see
Up on the table dancing
That's where romance is
If you're with me
Say
Whoa oah oah oah oah
(DJ DJ)

Oh-oh-ah-oh-oh-ah-ah-ah-ah
Oh-oh-ah-oh-oh-ah-ah-ah-ah

Thank you DJ for playing my song
Put that shit on replay all night long
Hey bartender better move those bottles
Better clear those tables
Cause they 'bout to be filled with models

(DJ DJ)
Put that sh*t on
(replay replay)
Spin it all night long
(DJ DJ)
Put that sh*t on
(replay replay)
Spin it all night long

'Cause I'll be table dancing
This is your chance
To be with me and you will see
Up on the table dancing
That's where romance is
If your with me
Say

Whoa oah oah oah oah - oh
Whoa oah oh woah oah - oh
Whoa oah oah oah oah - oh
Whoa oah oh woah oah - oh

Come on closer into my world
Show you all the reasons why I'm your favorite girl
Be-be-beside me don't let me fall
Just hold me close and don't let go until last call
