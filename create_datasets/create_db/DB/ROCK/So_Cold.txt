Crowded streets all cleared away
One by one
Hollow heroes separate
As they run

You're so cold
Keep your hand in mine
Wise men wonder while
Strong men die

Show me how it ends
It's alright
Show me how defenseless
You really are
Satisfied and empty inside
That's alright
Let's give this another try

If you find your family
Don't you cry
In this land of make believe
Dead and dry

You're so cold
But you feel alive
Lay your hands on me
One last time

Show me how it ends
It's alright
Show me how defenseless
You really are
Satisfied and empty inside
That's alright
Let's give this another try

Show me how it ends
It's alright
Show me how defenseless
You really are
Satisfied and empty inside
That's alright
Let's give this another try

It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
