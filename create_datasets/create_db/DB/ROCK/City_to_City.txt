Now the night train is waitin' to take me away
And I'm still feelin' guilty cause you're wanting me to stay
Well I know, how I know, it's harder on you
But you said it yourself, there's nothing else we could do.
When the wheels start turnin', takin' me through the night
Out there in the darkness, there's a star shinin' bright
And it makes me feel better just to see it up there
I hope you're thinkin' about it, hope you know I still care.
So goodnight, yeah goodnight
Goodnight train is gonna carry me home
So goodnight, yeah goodnight
Goodnight train is gonna carry me home.
Now I know you've been waiting, but I'll be seeing you soon
Meanwhile I just lay here staring at the moon
And a light made of silver, through my window it creeps
And the train keeps on rollin', and it just rocks me to sleep.
So goodnight, yeah goodnight
Goodnight train is gonna carry me home
So goodnight, yeah goodnight
Goodnight train is gonna carry me home
So goodnight, yeah goodnight
Goodnight train is gonna carry me home.
So goodnight, yeah goodnight
Goodnight train is gonna carry me home.
Now from city to city, it's four hundred miles
And I'm bound to wake up every once in a while
And it's then that I call out to some higher power
And then I'll go back to sleep cause I'll be home in an hour.
So goodnight (goodnight), yeah goodnight (goodnight)
Goodnight train is gonna carry me home (goodnight)
So goodnight (goodnight), yeah goodnight (goodnight)
Goodnight train is gonna carry me home (goodnight)
So goodnight (goodnight), yeah goodnight (goodnight)
Goodnight train is gonna carry me home (goodnight)
So goodnight (goodnight), yeah goodnight (goodnight)
Goodnight train is gonna carry me home (goodnight)
(fade)
I'm going home (ooooh) tonight
