Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Last night you breathed the deepest sigh
Turned away with those cold cool eyes
You said won't you give me space to breathe
And my tears gave you confidence to leave 

Now you say I'm just to much for you
There are things you'll never know
If you lie and cheat so easily
You'd better go, go, go, go, yeah 

All I know is how I feel
And my heart was always yours to steal
But you take and never give to me
Your kisses are charity

Your kisses are charity, yeah 
Yesterday you were my brightest star
But even when you're near I don't know where you are
I was wrong to show my weaker side

Now it's much too late to cry, cry, cry 
I was blind to put my trust in you
If you leave me, I'll fall apart
Did you plan to make a fool out of me

From the start, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
All I know is how I feel
And my heart was always yours to steal
But you take and never give to me

Your kisses are charity
Your kisses are charity, yeah, yeah 

Now you say, I'm too much for you
There are things you'll never know

If you lie and cheat so easily
You'd better go, go, go, go, yeah 
All I know is how I feel
And my heart was always yours to steal

But you take and never give to me
Your kisses are charity
(All I know) all I know is how I feel
(And my heart) and my heart was always yours to steal
(But you take) yeah you never give to me 
Your kisses are charity
Your kisses are charity, yeah, yeah
Your kisses are charity
