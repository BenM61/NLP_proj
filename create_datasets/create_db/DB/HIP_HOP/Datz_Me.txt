I'm talkin' dirty, wit' bout 80 thousand in my mouth
I'm stompin' through this bitch, movin' 'em in, and shippin' 'em out
Breath smell like hennessey, my clothes smell like weed
Atl & tennessee, I'm right up the street
In the club where the thugs be, it be hard to breathe
Sean paul said we gon' bust they head before we leave
I brought so good wit me, and I got my hood wit me
Cadillac'n all through college park, I'm talkin bout wood grippin'
Dirty south, they bullshittin', you can't ride on them down here
Niggaz can damn well fit inside their rims round here
And our hoes drop it down to the ground like they supposed to
Or f*ck a nigga whole crew, anytime we roll through
Young buck and youngbloodz, we came here to show you
Just how to start a fight and what that grey goose and dro'll do
Snatch me a ho or two, niggaz know howe we do it
Ain't nothin' change, you know the game, it's gunit!

Totin' guns, rollin' blunts, gettin' crunk that's me
Switchin' lanes, grippin' grains, got them thangs that's me
Swervin lac's, servin x, countin' stacks that's me
Cook it up and bring it back, that's a fact that's me

Stay fresh, white tees, sharp crease that's me
In the chevy grippin' grain, drippin' paint that's me
In the club, 'bout drunk, stay crunk that's me
Represent the atown, best believe that's me

Now on the realer, I'm a hell of a nigga
Like when I was down in that 'cedes dealer came out a winner
I'm a big bank flipper, purple syrup sipper
Stuntin' ass nigga, cost my thunder for some spinners
Don't you see the chain and watch, bitch, we chillin' like December
Finna change the weather when I stick it out the window
And I don't want no sack, mayn, don't give me that ever
And if the price the lo'lo', then gon' give me two mo'
Give me twolo, when I ride out with two hoes
One dark skin, one light skin, wit two though
Let the top down and let them hoes hair blow
Fired up some dro, this like ridin on two fo's wit' two hoes

Stay fresh, white tees, sharp crease that's me
In the chevy grippin' grain, drippin' paint that's me
In the club, 'bout drunk, stay crunk that's me
Represent the atown, best believe that's me

Stay slizzard on patron, herringbone that's me
In the club tippin' strippers, sippin' goose that's me
Ridin' clean, blowin' good on that dro that's me
Dirty south, straight country, 105 that's me

[jbo]
See I can tell by the way they look me in the eye
That he's a ho, and she's a bitch, and often many try
But like a soldier, I'mma rid til' I fuckin' die
Swerve on the buster, run up and put one in the sky
And if you ain't comprehendin' what I'm sayin' to ya
It's 105, youngbloodz, and I ain't playin' wit'hca
Now watch me break 'em down, back 'em up, and ship 'em out
Even steady, comin', breakin bread, what I'm talkin' bout
Cause what you didn't know, is how I get so many hoes
How I keep it pimpin' never, sippin' cause I'm all pro
And yeah, I see you like the way we do it big
Pull up in the old schools, blowin, hoppin' out the whip

Stay slizzard on patron, herringbone that's me
In the club tippin' strippers, sippin' goose that's me
Ridin' clean, blowin' good on that dro that's me
Dirty south, straight country, 105 that's me

Totin' guns, rollin' blunts, gettin' crunk that's me
Switchin' lanes, grippin' grains, got them thangs that's me
Swervin lac's, servin x, countin' stacks that's me
Cook it up and bring it back, that's a fact that's me

Stay fresh, white tees, sharp crease that's me
In the chevy grippin' grain, drippin' paint that's me
In the club, 'bout drunk, stay crunk that's me
Represent the atown, best believe that's me
