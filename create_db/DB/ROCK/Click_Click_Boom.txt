C'mon c'mon, c'mon c'mon
On those Saturdays when kids go out and play,
Yo I was up in my room I let the stereo blaze,
Wasn't faded, not jaded
Just a kid with a pad and pen and a big imagination.
All this, I seek,
I find I push the envelope to the line,
Make it, break it, take it
Until I'm overrated.

Click, click boom.
I'm coming down on the stereo,
Hear me on the radio,
Click, click boom.
I'm coming down with the new style and you know it's buck wild.
Click, click boom
I'm on the radio station touring round the nation,
Leaving the scene in devastation.

I can see it in my mind,
I can see it in their eyes.
It's close enough to touch it now,
But far away enough to die.

What the hell is wrong with me?
My mom and dad weren't perfect,
But still you don't hear no cryin' ass bitchin' from me,
Like there seems to be on everybody's CD
So just sit back and relax and let me have your head for a minute,
I can show you something in it,
That has yet to be presented,
Oh yeah!

Click, click boom.
I'm coming down on the stereo,
Hear me on the radio,
Click, click boom.
I'm coming down with the new style and you know it's buck wild.
Click, click boom
I'm on the radio station touring round the nation,
Leaving the scene in devastation.

Why have I clouded up my mind,
Why's my mother always right,
And will I make it to the end?
Or will I crawl away and die?

Click, click, boom.
Click, click boom.
Click, click boom.
Click, click boom.

On those Saturday when kids go out and play yo I was up in my room
I let the stereo blaze on Saturdays
When kids go out and play, I was up in my room
I let the stereo blaze
It's all inside of me
It's all inside of me
It's all inside of me
It's all inside of my head.
It's all inside of me
It's coming over me.
It's all inside of me
It's all inside my head, yeah!
Click, click boom
I'm coming down on the stereo hear me on the radio.
Click click boom
I'm comin' down with the new style you know it's buck wild.
Everybody, everybody come on (C'mon, c'mon)
Everybody come on (C'mon, c'mon)
Click click boom
C'mon, c'mon, everybody c'mon, click click boom
Click click boom!
