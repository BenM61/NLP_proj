Eighteen yellow roses came today
 Eighteen yellow roses in a pretty bouquet
 When the boy came to the door
 I didn't know what to say
 But eighteen yellow roses came today
 I opened up the card to see what it said
 I couldn't believe my eyes
 When I had read
 Though you belong to another I love you anyway
 Yes eighteen yellow roses came today
 I never doubted your love for a minute
 I always thought that you would be true
 But now this box and the flowers in it
 I guess there's nothin' left for me to do
 But ask to meet the boy that's done this thing
 And find out if he's got plans to buy you a ring
 'Cause eighteen yellow roses will wilt and die one day
 But a father's love will never fade away
 Will never fade away
