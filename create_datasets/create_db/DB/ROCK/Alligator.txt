Sensitive
It's true
Alligator tears cried over you
Over you, over you
Over you, over you

Run around on me
I'd sooner die without
Run around on me
I'll die without

Relentless
Yes, it's true
My motor mouth
It runs over you
Over you, over you
Over you, over you

Run around on me
I'd sooner die without
Run around on me
I'll die without

Over you, over you
Over you, over you
Over you, over you
Over you, over you

Run around on me
I'd sooner die without
Run around on me
I'll die without

No hissy fits, mind my manners
I won't make a scene

Oh, over you
Over you, over you
Over you
Over you, over you

Run around on me
I'd sooner die without
Run around on me
I'll die without

Rattled yes, it's true
Alligator tears spilled over you

Run around on me
I'd sooner die without
Run around on me
I'll die without you
Run around on me
I'd sooner die without
Run around on me
I'll die without

Over you, over you
Over you
Over you, over you
Over you, over you
Over you, over you
Over you
Over you, over you
Over you
Over you, over you
