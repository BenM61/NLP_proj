I don't know what they're telling you
But I know we can turn it around
I know I've hurt you, and I've not been true
But I know I can turn it around

A song of desperation, but I'm not letting go
I'll be with you in the hour, I'll be with you
They said we were too young, to keep our love so strong
You said you want devotion, look no further

I don't know what they're telling you
But I know we can turn it around
I know I've hurt you, and I've not been true
But I know I can turn it around

A song of desperation, but I'm not letting go
I'll be with you in the hour, I'll be with you
They said we were too young, to keep our love so strong
You said you want devotion, look no further

Keep our love so
Keep our love so 
Keep our love so 
Keep our love so 
Keep our love so 
Keep our love so 
Keep our love so 
Keep our love so 
Keep our love so 
Keep our love so 
Keep our love so 
Keep our love so 

It's inside
It's all around you
I'm going to put these arms
All around you
