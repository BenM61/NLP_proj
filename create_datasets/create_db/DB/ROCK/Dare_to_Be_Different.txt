From the album donovan

Dare to be different - learn to be lonely
Dare to be different - learn to be lonely
If you don't want to, do what the rest do
Dare to be different
If you think you've got it - why don't you flaunt it
If you think you've got it - why don't you flaunt it
If you don't want to, do what the rest do
Dare to be different
Dare to be different - Dare to be different
Dare to be different - Dare to be different
If you don't want to, do what the rest do
Dare to be different
If you don't like it - Why don't you bike it
If you don't like it - Why don't you bike it
If you can't stand it - be like a bandit
Dare to be different
