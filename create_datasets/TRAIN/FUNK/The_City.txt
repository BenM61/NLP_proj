Well, I slept last night in the open
Down by a redwood tree
Yes, I slept last night in the open
Just to let, just to let, just to let my soul free
I don't want to know, I don't want to go
I don't want to go back into the city
It's just a long long long lonely taxi ride
Going nowhere
Well, I slept last night in the open
(It gets so hot in the city)
Down by a redwood tree
(It gets so hot in the city)
Yes, I slept last night in the open
Just to let, just to let, just to let my soul free
I don't want to know, I don't want to go
I don't want to go back into the city
It's just a long long long lonely taxi ride
Going nowhere
