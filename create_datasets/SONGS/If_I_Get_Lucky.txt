When I fall down hard I don't break, I just bruise, 
I get the call to give or take, if I chose, 
And I keep runnin' night and day if I can't find the truth, 
Anyway it's all the same 'til someone cuts me loose. 

But if I get lucky, maybe life will be a cruise, 
If I get lucky maybe I can lose these lonesome blues, yeah 
If I get lucky, babe, if I get lucky, babe. 

I build a wall to hide behind, keepin' low, 
I need a hole to crawl inside when things get slow, 
But I believe the danger line begins with you alone, 
Someday baby you might find that its me who's coming home. 

But if I get lucky, maybe life will be a cruise, 
If I get lucky maybe I can lose these lonesome blues, yeah 
If I get lucky, babe, if I get lucky, get lucky. 

Well it easy to say some things never change, 
So why should they change for me ? 
Though I never tried I can't be denied, 
I set all your horses free.
