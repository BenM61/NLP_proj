Well he used to be a tailor
Sew those suits so fine
And he never heard of failure
And he never tasted wine
And he used to be a leader
When he had someone to lead
And he used to be a father
When he had some mouths to feed
When he had some mouths to feed

And they say it never rains in L.A. county
But it gets cold enough to wish you had a few
And he laughs tonight and say's "I finally found me
A room with a view - how about you?"

He was living in a castle
That he built with his own hands
Out of newspaper and cardboard
He was living off the land
He was living off the land
He was living of the land

And they say it never rains in L.A. county ...
