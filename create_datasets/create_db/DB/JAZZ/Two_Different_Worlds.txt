Nothing matters if I am yours and you are mine.
Two different words,
We live in two different worlds
For we've been told,
That a love like ours
Could never be.

So far apart,
They say we're so far apart
And that we haven't
The right to change our destiny.

When will they learn,
That a heart doesn't draw a line.
Nothing matters if I am yours and you are mine.

Two different worlds
We live in two different worlds
But we will show them as we walk together in the sun,
That our two different worlds are one.

When will they learn,
That a heart doesn't draw a line.
Nothing matters if I am yours and you are mine.

Two different worlds
We live in two different worlds
But we will show them as we walk together in the sun,
That our two different worlds are one.
