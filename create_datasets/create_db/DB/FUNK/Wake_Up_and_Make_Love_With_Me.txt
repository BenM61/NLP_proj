You I come awake
With the gift for womankind
I'm still alseep
But the gift don't seem to mind
Rise on this occasion
Halfway up my back
Sliding down my body
Touching my behind

If I look so self-possessed
Oh please disturb my rest
It's lovely when I'm sleeping
But wide awake is best

Wake up and make love with me
Wake up and make love
Wake up and make love with me
I don't wanna make you
I'll let the fancy take you
And you'll wake up and make love

I come awake
In a horny morning mood
And we'll have a proper wriggle
In the naughty, naked nude
Roll against my body
Ooh, get me where you want me
What happens next is private
It's also very rude

I'll go and get the post
And make some tea and toast
You have another sleep luv
It's me that needs it most

Wake up and make love with me
Wake up and make love
Wake up and make love with me
I don't wanna make you
I'll let the fancy take you
And you'll wake up and make love

Wake up and make love with me
Wake up and make love
Wake up and make love with me
Wake up and make love
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
