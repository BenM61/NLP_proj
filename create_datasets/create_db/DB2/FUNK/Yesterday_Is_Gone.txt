I don't even want to talk about it
It's just one of those things
Trouble and more heartache, is all it will bring
So let's think of our future, and leave bygones alone
And talk about tomorrow, yesterday is gone

I know just how you feel baby (I know, I know)
But it's all said and done
You said yourself there was nothing (I know, I know)
Love can't overcome (Oh)
So let's think of our future, and leave bygones alone
And talk about tomorrow (Oh)
Yesterday is gone (Yesterday is gone)

(I just can't forget the past) (Although it's been so long)
All I really want to do, is just love you from now on
(I just can't forget the past) (What should we do from now on)
Baby let me tell you, we should think of tomorrow
Yesterday is gone (Yesterday is gone)

Now there's some lies to what you say
Although I'll admit some things are true
But what does that got to do with
You loving me and my loving you
So let's think of our future (Do do's)
And leave bygones alone (Do do's)
And talk about tomorrow (Oh)
Yesterday is gone (Yesterday is gone)
