Sukkafish and die tonight
I'm falling before you
I'm falling before you

And you will cry, yeah
Read a note of suicide
I'm falling before you
I'm falling before you

I ain't ever seen
This valley before
You know I would
I ain't ever

I might lie, yeah
Sukkafish and die tonight
I'm falling before you
I'm falling before you

And you will cry, yeah
Read a note of suicide
I'm falling before you
I'm falling before you

I ain't ever seen
This mountain before
You know I would
I ain't ever

I might lie, yeah
Sukkafish and die tonight
I'm falling before you
