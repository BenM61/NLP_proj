Fell in love, and everything that I wanted
What a life for me
Now a thing don't mean a thing, since we've parted
Meant the world to me
And though my heart's still beatin', when will I breathe again
And when will someone wake me from, this awful dream I'm in

If you could see the way I live my life
If you could see the way I cry at night
If you could understand the reasons why
That I'm loving you still
If you could hear me when I call your name
You gotta know I'll never ever love again
'Cause I'm loving you still

I had someone watch over me, my protector
Kept me safe and warm
I had someone makin' love to me, I thought forever
Forever now is gone...
So I spend my days pretending, I spend my nights alone
I've never missed somebody so, I've never loved so strong

If you could see the way I live my life
If you could see the way I cry at night
If you could understand the reasons why
That I'm loving you still
If you could hear me when I call your name
You gotta know I'll never ever love again
'Cause I'm loving you still

And now that you have gone away
Lord knows that I must pray
That we will meet again
But until then

If you could see the way I live my life
If you could see the way I cry at night
If you could understand the reasons why
That I'm loving you still
If you could hear me when I call your name
You gotta know I'll never ever love again
'Cause I'm loving you still
