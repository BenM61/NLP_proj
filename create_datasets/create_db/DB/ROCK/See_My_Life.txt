Oh you rush to and fro to attain, though you dwell upon the shore of history.
The voice you should have heard in is the letter of the Word.
Come with me dear friends and you'll see.
See my life, as it was yesterday. 
See my life, as it was today.
Take my hand and I will show you. 
Within the moment lies the mystery.

Oh you seek here and yon in your quest, and arrive at the hour of regret
Come fly without distress to the shelter of the nest
Close your eyes, your ears, and forget.
Forget life, as it was yesterday. 
Forget life, as it was today.
Take my hand and I will show you. 
Within the moment lies the mystery.

Come, behold him. Standing there within.
The Garden of Ridvan, come join the caravan.
I'm sure you'll understand.

Oh you rush to and fro to attain, though you dwell upon the shore of history.
The voice you should have heard in is the letter of the Word.
Come with me dear friends and you'll see.
See my life, as it was yesterday. 
See my life, as it was today.
Take my hand and I will show you. 
Within the moment lies the mystery.
See my life, as it was yesterday. 
See my life, as it was today, hey hey hey.
Won't you come and come and see my life, my life, my life.
