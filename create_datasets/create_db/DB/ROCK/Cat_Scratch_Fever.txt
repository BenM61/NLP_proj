Well I don't know where they come from
But they sure do come
I hope they comin' for me
And I don't know how they do it but they sure do it good
I hope they doin' it for free

They give me cat scratch fever
Cat scratch fever

The first time that I got it 
I was just ten years old
I got it from some kitty next door
I went and see the Dr. and he gave me the cure
I think I got it some more

They give me cat scratch fever
Cat scratch fever

I got a bad cat scratch fever
Cat scratch fever

It's nothin' dangerous I feel no pain
I've got to ch-ch-change
You know you got it when you're going insane
It makes a grown man cryin' cryin'
Won't you make my bed

I make the pussy purr with the stroke of my hand
They know they gettin' it from me
They know just where to go
When they need their lovin' man
They know I do it for free

I give 'em cat scratch fever
Cat scratch fever
They got it bad scratch fever
Cat scratch fever

Cat scratch fever
Cat scratch fever
Cat scratch fever

Cat scratch fever
Cat scratch fever
Cat scratch fever
