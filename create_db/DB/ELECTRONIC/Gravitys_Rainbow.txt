Come on with me through ruined lipglock
Across Tangian deserts, we'll flock
Madcap Medusa, flank my foghorn
We'll change four seasons with our first born

All ships of sense on hyper ocean
All kites of chaos, still in motion
My culture vulture, such a dab hand
I'll steal you from the year 4000

Come with me, come with me, we'll travel to infinity
Come with me, come with me, we'll travel to infinity
I'll always be there, oh, oh, my future love
I'll always be there for you, my future love

Your tears leave trails of [Incomprehensible]
Autonoma, the [Incomprehensible]
Most crippled lines that I can't get to
You'd slip through time but I won't let you

Come with me, come with me, we'll travel to infinity
Come with me, come with me, we'll travel to infinity
I'll always be there, oh, oh, my future love
I'll always be there for you, my future love

Come with me, come with me, we'll travel to infinity
Come with me, come with me, we'll travel to infinity
I'll always be there, oh, oh, my future love
I'll always be there for you, my future love

Come with me, come with me, we'll travel to infinity
Come with me, come with me, we'll travel to infinity
I'll always be there, oh, oh, my future love
I'll always be there for you, my future love

Come with me, come with me, we'll travel to infinity
Come with me, come with me, we'll travel to infinity
I'll always be there, oh, oh, my future love
I'll always be there for you, my future love
