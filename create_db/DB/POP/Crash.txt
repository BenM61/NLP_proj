Here you go way too fast 
Don't slow down, you're gonna crash 
You should watch, watch your step 
Don't look out, you gonna break your neck

So shut, shut your mouth 
Cause I'm not listening anyhow 
I've had enough, enough of you 
Enough to last a lifetime through 

So what do you want of me 
Got no words of sympathy 
And if I go around with you 
You know that I'll get messed up too with you 
(with you)

Na na-na na-na na na-na na-na ah 
Slow down, you're gonna crash 
Na na-na na-na na na-na na-na ah

So here you go way too fast 
Don't slow down, you're gonna crash 
You don't know what's been going down 
You've been running all over town 

So shut, shut your mouth 
Cause I'm not listening anyhow 
I've had enough, enough of you 
Enough to last a lifetime through 

So what do you want of me 
Got no cure for misery 
And if I go around with you 
You know that I'll get messed up too with you 
With you, with you

Na na-na na-na na na-na na-na ah 
Slow down, you're gonna crash 
Na na-na na-na na na-na na-na ah 
Slow down, you're gonna crash
Na na-na na-na na na-na na-na ah
Slow down, you're gonna crash
Na na-na na-na na na-na na-na ah
Slow down, you're gonna crash
Na na-na na-na na na-na na-na ah
Na na-na na-na na na-na na-na ah 
Slow down, you're gonna crash
