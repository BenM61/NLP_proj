Here we go
Power tripping your luck is switched
Oh, so now it's funny
When it's your turn is to laugh
You go poke the running joke!

Scoring points with God
Get no perfect marks
But your grades keep falling
How you treat the weak is
Your true nature calling

Porn chick calls herself a therapist
Call it what it is...
For all the money in the world
We'll go to war you backward hero's

Come to rescue you
Just to lien on you
With interests soaring
How you treat the weak is
Your true nature calling

Please believe
We still live and breathe
Through native tongue
And poetry
All those years we believed, yeah

Scoring points with God
Get no perfect marks
But your grades keep falling
How you treat the weak is
Your true nature calling
