As we were young
We believed in wonder
The shadows of our unfeigned souls
We were so much stronger

A sweet life, unrestrained and wild
A sweet life, glad to be a child
A sweet life, we had no price to pay
A sweet life, day by day

As we were young
We ran through the fields
We let things take their course
Had nothing to conceal

As we were young
We could move mountains
Our childlike heart and soul
Were our strength's fountain

A sweet life, unrestrained and wild
A sweet life, glad to be a child
A sweet life, we had no price to pay
A sweet life, day by day

A sweet life
