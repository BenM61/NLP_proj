See the smoke when the sun shines
We will forever be faded under gold skies
Captivated in your cold eyes
We will forever be faded under gold skies
See the smoke when the sun shines
We will forever be faded under gold skies
Captivated in your cold eyes
We will forever be faded under gold skies

Coming up, cut me down, look at all the stuff we found
Touch the sun, feel me now, we will live forever
Coming up, cut me down, look at all the stuff we found
Touch the sun, feel me now, we will live forever
Coming up, cut me down, look at all the stuff we found
Touch the sun, feel me now, we will live forever
Coming up, cut me down, look at all the stuff we found
Touch the sun, feel me now, we will live forever

Coming up, coming up, coming up, coming up
Coming up, coming up, coming up, coming up
Coming up, coming up, coming up, coming up
(Coming up) We will forever be faded under gold skies

Coming up, cut me down, look at all the stuff we found
Touch the sun, feel me now, we will live forever
Coming up, cut me down, look at all the stuff we found
Touch the sun, feel me now, we will live forever
Coming up, cut me down, look at all the stuff we found
Touch the sun, feel me now, we will live forever

Touch the sun, feel me now, we will live forever

Coming up, coming up, coming up, coming up
Coming up, coming up, coming up, coming up
Coming up, coming up, coming up, coming up
We will forever be faded under gold skies

We will forever be faded under gold skies
