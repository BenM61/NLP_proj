Come on down, come on down 
You'll never get to heaven
When you wear a frown 
There's more to life than a TV gameshow
Where money wraps itself around your half Yeah

I'm gonna write your name in the book of angels
Laughing moment, curse the rising moon
When the whole world shatter
It's what you got inside that matters(Angel)
So spread your wings and fly away

From terror, fear and dismay(Angel)
It's much too late to say and cry 
Forget the past just walk on

There's a party going on in Atomic City
Some are dancing but none are sitting pretty
There's a party going on in Atomic City
Some are slaves but none are sitting pretty

We've got no ozone 
We got radiation 
See the air pollution
From the power station 

There's a party going on in Atomic City
Some are dancing but none are sitting pretty
La luna es hermosa ... yeah 
La luna es hermosa ... yeah
Thank your lucky stars 
We're not on Jupiter or Mars
Thank your lucky stars 
We're not on Jupiter or Mars

Come on down, come on down
You'll never get to heaven if you wear a frown
Win a holiday a gameshow 
Wrap tinsel around your halo
Beat the system before it beats you 
Beat the system with your point of view
Beat the system, it's the only way
Beat the system or there'll be hell to pay

Thank your lucky stars 
Your father's castrated
Your mother's sedated 
Your brother's on the run
Sister's running round with everyone

I'm gonna write your name in the book of angels
Laughing moment curse the rising moon
Someday life's a mean machine
You step right through the TV screen(Angel)
Let's put the world to right 
Don't give up the fight(Angel)

If time stood still on my windowsill 
I'd squash it like a fly(Angel)
We've got no ozone
