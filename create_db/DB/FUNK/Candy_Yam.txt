Who lifts me up when I'm down? 
Who's the one always around? 
Candy Yam, I wanna thank you ma'am 
Oh yeah, oh yeah 

When my days are dark as night 
Who pulls the chain from the night? 
Holy cow, I wanna thank you, child 
Oh yeah, oh yeah 

I don't know what I would do without you 
I wouldn't even try 
If anything would ever come between us 
I would surely die, yeah 

Who always thinks of me first? 
Who's gonna meet me in church? 
Holy cow, I wanna thank you, child 
Oh yeah, oh yeah 

Who gives me right when I'm wrong? 
Who will I love from now on? 
Candy Yam, I wanna thank you ma'am 
Oh yeah, oh yeah
