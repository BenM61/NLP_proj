Aw baby

The way you shake it,
I can't believe it,
I ain't never seen an a** like that,
The way you move it,
You make my pee pee go,
Da-doing doing doing,
I don't believe it
It's almost too good to be true,
I ain't never seen an a** like that,
The way you move it,
You make my pee pee go
Da-doing doing doing

The way she moves she's like a belly dancer
She's shakin' that a** to that new Nelly jams, I
Think someone's at the door
But I don't think I'm a answer
Police saying "freeze" da-doing doing doing,
What do you mean freeze?
Please, I'm a human being, I have needs
I'm not done, not 'til I'm finished peeing
I am not resisting arrest
I am agreeing Mr. Officer,
I'm already on my knees,
I can't get on the ground any further
It's impossible for me
And do not treat me like a murderer,
I just like to pee, pee, pee
Yes, I make R and B I sing song It goes
Ring-a-chong, a-ching-chong-chong-chong-ching
Sike, I joke I joke I kidd I kidd
If I offend I'm sorry,
Please, please forgive
For I am Triumph the puppet dog
I am a mere puppet
I can get away with anything I say and
You will love it

The way you shake it,
I can't believe it,
I ain't never seen an a** like that,
The way you move it,
You make my pee pee go,
Da-doing doing doing,
I don't believe it
It's almost too good to be true,
I ain't never seen an a** like that,
The way you move it,
You make my pee pee go
Da-doing doing doing
The way you shake it,
I can't believe it,
I ain't never seen an a** like that,
The way you move it,
You make my pee pee go,
Da-doing doing doing,
Jessica Simpson,
Looks so-so tempting,
Nick I ain't never seen an a** like that,
Every time I see that show on MTV my pee pee goes
Da-doing doing doing

Mary-Kate and Ashley used to be so wholesome,
Now they're getting older they're starting
To grow bum-bums
I go to the movies and sit down with my popcorn
Police saying "freeze" da-doing doing doing
What do you mean freeze?
Jeez I just got my seat I have ticket look,
I put it away my zipper's zipped
Please do not remove me from this
Movie theater please
I did not even get to see, Mary-Kate shower scene
I didn't mean to be obscene or
Make a great big scene
And don't treat me like I'm Peewee Herman
This movie's P-G
Mr. Officer I demand to see my attorney,
I will simply plead innocent
Cop a plea and be free, free, yes, free
Right back on the streets,
What do you mean my lawyer's with Michael
He's too busy?
I am Triumph,
Britney Spears has shoulders like a man
And I can say that and you'll laugh
Cause there's a puppet on my hand (Ha ha)

The way you shake it,
I can't believe it,
I ain't never seen an a** like that,
The way you move it,
You make my pee pee go,
Da-doing doing doing,
I don't believe it
It's almost too good to be true,
I ain't never seen an a** like that,
The way you move it,
You make my pee pee go
Da-doing doing doing

The way she moves she dances like a go-go,
In the video she sings
"Get out you bozo"
I need a new boyfriend hi my name is JoJo
Police saying "freeze" da-doing doing doing
What do you mean freeze?
My computers will be seized
And my keys, to my ranch
I just baked cookies, Mr. Officer,
Lookie, take a whiff of these,
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this,
Nobody is safe from me, no not even me
I don't even know if I can say the word pee pee
Pee, On the radio, but I think I did,
Janet, is that a breast?
I think I just saw a tit!
Sike, I joke I joke I kidd I kidd
I don't think my joke is working
I must flee quick
Get to the chopper, everybody get out
I am not Triumph, I am Arnold get down!

The way you shake it,
I can't believe it,
I ain't never seen an a** like that,
The way you move it,
You make my pee pee go,
Da-doing doing doing,
I don't believe it
It's almost too good to be true,
I ain't never seen an a** like that,
The way you move it,
You make my pee pee go
Da-doing doing doing

What the f*** is wrong wit chu?  (Ha ha ha)
