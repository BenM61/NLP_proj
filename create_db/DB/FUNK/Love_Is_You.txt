You never tell me, no, when you know I'm going to ask
But like a woman in your way you show
That you're always willing, share the same feeling

Love is you
(I thank you)
Love is you
(I thank you)
Oh, I know that love is you now
(Precious love)

When you smile I know everything about you, Lord
And when you touch me and whisper real softly
You say you're ready, then call me sweet daddy

Love is you
(I thank you)
Love is you
(I thank you)
Oh, I know that love is you, yeah
(Precious love)

You make the world go round
You lift me up when I'm falling down
You make me need you, oh, you must be magic
'Cause you're always willing, share the same good feeling

Love is you
(I thank you)
Love is you
(I thank you)
Oh, I know that love is you, oh yeah
(My old precious love)

You're good, love
(I thank you)
You're good, love
(I thank you)
Oh, I know it's you
(My old precious love)
You know I'm not gonna work in my life

'Cause love is you
(I thank you)
Love is you
(I thank you)
Love is you
(My old precious love)
