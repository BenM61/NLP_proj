I've lived a little
I've loved a lot
I lost myself to you

We tied our dreams up
In a lover's knot
But none of them came true

My solid ground soon
Turned to quicksand
The warm winds turned to frost

Where does love go
When it has no plan
When everything is lost

The only thing that I forgot
Was that we walk alone
I'm learning how to stand again
A steady hand again

I'm gonna be ok
I'm gonna be just fine
I'm gonna be alright now

Alright now

I'm gonna make the grade (make the grade)
I'm gonna take my time (take my time)
I'm gonna be alright now (gonna be alright now)

Alright now

I'm gonna be ok
I'm gonna be just fine
I'm gonna be alright now

Alright now

I'm gonna make the grade (make the grade)
I'm gonna take my time (take my time)
I'm gonna be alright now (gonna be alright now)

Alright now
Alright now

Alright now
Alright now

Alright now

You said you loved me bigger
Than the universe the sun and all the stars
You said that there was nothing that we couldn't overcome
And yet we fell apart

We fell apart
