Ooh ooh ooh

If I had to paint a picture
To show the world how true love can really be
I would use the brightest colors
To create a vision of harmony
It would be a reality
Cause its only what's inside of my heart
You would see I've always loved you right from the very start

Tell me what is the color of love?
What do you see?
Is it warm is it tender when you think of me
I see the color of love when I'm thinking of you
As a picture perfect painting of love forever true

The colors of the rainbow turn grey whenever you're so far away
It changes like the seasons
You're the reason it happens that way
What you see are colors of emotion
Reflecting what I feel deep inside
Now I'd like to take a look at emotions that you hide

Tell me what is the color of love?
What do you see?
Is it warm is it tender when you think of me
I see the color of love when I'm thinking of you
As a picture perfect painting of love forever true

And oh though many may try to keep us apart
Oh the colors that I see in you will shine a light to see us through
No matter what the world will do I'll always love you
Ooh ooh ooh

Oh what is the color of love oh tell me tell me
Oh I want to know I want to know - when I'm thinking of you
As a picture perfect paining of love forever true
