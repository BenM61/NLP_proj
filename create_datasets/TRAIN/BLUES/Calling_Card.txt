Well, the rain ain't fussy about where it lands, 
It'll find you hiding no matter where you stand. 
It's gonna rain brother, and it's gonna rain hard, 
When the blues comes calling with it's calling card.  
It ain't too funny when you'd rather die, 
Ain't no pleasure when that girl don't reply. 
To your love sick letter that you wrote in tears, 
About feeling so bad for a million years. 

Watch out brother, be alert, 
But whatever you do, don't show that hurt, 
Don't show that hurt, show that hurt. 

I've been subjected, I've been so distressed, 
Come back baby, to clean up this mess, 
Clean up this mess.  

It ain't so funny when you'd rather die, 
Ain't no pleasure when that girl don't reply. 
To your lovesick letter that you wrote in tears, 
About feeling so bad for a million years. 

Yeah, the rain ain't fussy about where it falls, 
It rains on one like it rains on all. 
But when it falls brother, it's gonna rain hard, 
When the blues comes calling with it's calling card. 

Watch out brother, be alert, 
Whatever you do, don't show that hurt, 
Don't show that hurt.
