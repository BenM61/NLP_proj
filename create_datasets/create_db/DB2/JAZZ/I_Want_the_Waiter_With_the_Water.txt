I want the waiter with the water
I want the waiter with the water for my daughter
I want the waiter with the water for my daughter
'Cause my daughter has an order for some water on the tray

He's got a menu that'll send you
He's got a menu that'll send you and befriend you
He's got a menu that'll send you and befriend you
Maybe lend you if you help me find the waiter with the tray

While my daughter was having lunch one day
She caught the waiter's eye
He took one look at her, then ran away
Now she's bothered by her thirst unless I find that guy

I want the waiter with the water
I want the waiter with the water for my daughter
Don't want the butcher or the baker or the candlestick maker
Want the waiter with the water on the tray

(She wants the waiter with the water
She wants the waiter with the water for her daughter)
Don't want the butcher or the baker or the candlestick maker
Want the waiter with the water on the tray
