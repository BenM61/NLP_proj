We leave home, expecting to find a bluebird,
Hoping every cloud will be silver lined,
But we all return,
And as we live we learn
That we left our happiness behind.

The bird with feathers of blue
Is waiting for you,
Back in your own back yard.
You'll see your castle in Spain
Through your window pane,
Back in your own back yard.

Now you can go to the east,
Go to the west,
Bit some day you'll come,
Weary at heart, back where you started from.

You'll find your happiness lies
Right under your eyes,
Back in your own back yard.

The bird with feathers of blue
Is waiting for you,
Back in your own back yard.
You'll see your castle in Spain
Through your window pane,
Back in your own back yard.

Now you can fly to the east,
Fly to the west,
Bit some day you'll come,
Weary at heart, back where you started from.

You'll find your happiness lies
Right under your eyes,
Back in your, your own back yard.
