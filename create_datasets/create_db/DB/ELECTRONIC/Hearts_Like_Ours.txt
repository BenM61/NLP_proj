Borders and horizon lines
We're alone but side by side
We're yet to dream
We're yet to dream
Nothing here is what it seems
Ah ah ha
Ah ah ha

There's an animal inside
There's a fear that won't subside
Of all the things I'll never do
Will I ever follow through?

There's an animal inside
There's an animal inside

Half awake and almost dead
Keeping empty beds elsewhere
We're yet to bleed
We're yet to bleed
All the time and energy

Ah ah ah
In silence
Ah ah ah
In silence

Could we try to reinvent
Feed the head with common sense
Through the streets and avenues
Climbing up the walls with you
Climbing up the walls with you
Climbing up the walls with you

Half awake and almost dead
Keeping empty beds elsewhere
We're yet to bleed
We're yet to bleed
All the time and energy

Ah ah ah
In silence
Ah ah ah
In silence

Leave this place behind, in silence
And the weight we find inside us

Lead me to the edge of night
'Till the dawn
The end of time
'Till the fire blazing light
Shines again within our eyes

Half awake and almost dead
Keeping empty beds elsewhere
We're yet to bleed
We're yet to bleed
All the time and energy

Half awake and almost dead
Keeping empty beds elsewhere
We're yet to bleed
We're yet to bleed
All the time and energy
