I've got money in my pocket 
I like the color of my hair 
I've got a friend who loves me 
Got a house, I've got a car 
I've got a good mother 
And her voice is what keeps me here 

Feet on ground 
Heart in hand 
Facing forward 
Be yourself 
I've never wanted anything 
No I've, no I've, I've never wanted anything 
So bad, so bad 

Cardboard masks of all the people 
I've been 
Thrown out with all the rusted, tangled 
Dented God Damned miseries 
You could say I'm hard to hold 
But if you knew me you'd know 
I've got a good father 
And his strength is what makes me cry 

Feet on ground 
Heart in hand 
Facing forward 
Be yourself 
I've never wanted anything 
No I've, no I've, I've never 
Wanted anything so bad
So bad 

I've got money in my pocket 
I like the color of my hair 
I've got a friend who loves me 
Got a house, I've got a car 
I've got a good mother 
And her voice is what keeps me here 

Feet on ground 
Heart in hand 
Facing forward 
Be yourself 

Heart in hand 
Feet on ground 
Facing forward 
Be yourself 
Just be yourself 
Just be yourself 

Feet on ground 
Heart in hand 
Feet on ground 
Heart in hand
