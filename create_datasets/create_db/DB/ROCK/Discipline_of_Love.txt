You naughty girl: so sharp and dry
Don't fill yourself with foolish pride
You wanted me to notice you
But when I came, you cut me

Why did you do it?
Why did you go and spoil the fun?
Why did you do it?
You need the discipline of love some discipline

You wild child
How sweet you smile
Your crystal ball it's broken
Why did you do it?

Why did you go and spoil the fun?
Why did you do it?
You need the discipline of love some discipline
Take notice now: my turn to talk
The gate of love it's narrow
