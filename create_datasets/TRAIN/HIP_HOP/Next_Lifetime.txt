How can I want you for myself
When I'm already someones girl?

First time that I saw you boy
It was a warm and sunny day
All I know is I wanted you
I really hoped you looked my way
When you smiled at me
So warm and sweet
I could not stay
You make me feel like a itty-bitty girl
What do you do to me

Now what am I supposed to do
When I want you in my world
How can I want you for myself
When I'm already someones girl?

I guess I'll see you next lifetime
No hard feelings
I guess I'll see you next lifetime
I'm gonna be there

Your energy, feels so damn good to me
It picks me up don't want to come down
You got me spinning all around
Yeah
You need to know
I've got that somebody
You're beautiful
But it ain't that kind-a party nowww

Now what am I supposed to do

Well I guess I'll see you next lifetime
Baby we'll be butterflies
I guess I'll see you next lifetime
That sounds so divine

I guess I'll see you next lifetime
I guess I will now
I guess I'll see you next lifetime
Wait, wait a little while

See it ain't nothing wrong with dreaming
Boy don't get me wrong
'Cause every time (every time)  I see you (every single time)
I know just how strong (every single time)
That my love is for my baby
But emotions just don't lie
Well I know I'm a lot of woman
But not enough to divide the pie

Now what am I supposed to do
When I want you in my world
How can I want you for myself
When I'm already someones girl?

I guess I'll see you next lifetime
You know I want to stay around

I'm so confused now

Already
I'm going to be there
I guess I'll see you next lifetime
I'm going to look for you

Now what am I supposed to do
When I want you in my world

When I'm already someones girl?

I guess I'll see you next lifetime
Oh
Oh baby
I'm gonna be there
I'm gonna be there
