My sister and I remember still 
A tulip garden by an old Dutch mill, 
And the home that was all our own until 
But we don't talk about that. 
My sister and I recall once more 
The fishing schooners pulling into shore, 
And the dog-cart we drove in days before 
But we don't talk about that. 

We're learning to forget the fear 
That came from a troubled sky. 
We're almost happy over here, 
But sometimes we wake at night and cry. 
My sister and I recall the day 
We said goodbye, then we sailed away. 
And we think of our friends that had to stay, 
But we don't talk about that.
