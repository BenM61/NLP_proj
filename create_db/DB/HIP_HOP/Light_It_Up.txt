Ole Buddah, coming atcha life
Direct with the biggest fattest joint
Coming in with indo flavors
From Buddha, comin atcha like this in '95

It's Friday morning, where the weed at
Let me dip into my pocket for my fat weed sack
Cause I wanna get high like a plane in the sky
With the indo cloud in my brain

Where the f*ck are my Zig Zags and my lighter
so I can roll it and set it on fire
Damn, I wish I had scissors cause the shit is so sticky
that it's getting on my fuckin' fingers

But it's smokeable, double tokable,
I got the one-hitter and the Bombay shit that?s tokable
I wanna do a joint venture
Let me make sure there ain't no lump in the goddamn center
The impregnated-looking joint, f*ck it, I can smoke it and still get faded

Roll it up, light it up, smoke it up, inhale exhale
Roll it up, light it up, smoke it up, inhale exhale
Roll it up, light it up, smoke it up, inhale exhale
Roll it up, light it up, smoke it up, inhale exhale
(I'm the freaka, the one who freaks the funk)
(I'm the freaka, the one who freaks the funk)
(I'm the freaka, the one who freaks the funk)
(I'm the freaka, the one who freaks the funk)

East Coast hittin' that blunt West Coast hittin' that honey-dipped marijuana joint
And I want another hit
Roll it up, light it up, smoke it up, I wanna stimulate my mind so I toke it up
Can I get a hit, can I get a woooo

Gimme that fat bag of weed and the broom
So I can get faded, elevated, smoked the joint down with my bro's and I ate it
I stand true to the yesca (mota) as I keep runnin' from the chota
Gimme that weed fool and ya Zig Zags puto, don't be holdin' out on the big bag

Roll it up, light it up, smoke it up, inhale exhale
Roll it up, light it up, smoke it up, inhale exhale
Roll it up, light it up, smoke it up, inhale exhale
Roll it up, light it up, smoke it up, inhale exhale
(I'm the freaka, the one who freaks the funk)
(I'm the freaka, the one who freaks the funk)
(I'm the freaka, the one who freaks the funk)
