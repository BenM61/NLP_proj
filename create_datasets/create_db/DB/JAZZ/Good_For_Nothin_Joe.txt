It's gonna rain any minute
There's not a star in sight
Things are mighty slow
I guess, I'll close up shop
And go home to Joe

I know he won't be glad to see me
Without a penny to the good
But I'm not carin' much what happens
I did the best I could
He's just good-for-nothin' Joe

But, oh, I love him so
Guess, I'd die if good-for-nothin' Joe
Ever tried to leave me flat
Oh yes, I'm certain of that

Folks I know can't understand
Why I must have that man
Lord, he sends me like nobody can
Ain't a woman just like that?

I wouldn't mind doin' what I'm doin'
I'd beat these streets till my feet were sore
But when it's slow and I go home to him
Instead of sympathy, he's just as mean as can be

Still there's nothin' I can do
Because I love him so
I'd be good for nothin' too, I know
Without good-for-nothin' Joe

I'd be good for nothin' too, I know
Without good-for-nothin' Joe
I'm goin' home to Joe
