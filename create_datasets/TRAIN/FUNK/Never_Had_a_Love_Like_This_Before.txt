Oh, you sure
You sure have got me, girl

At last I'm past the fantasy
Into my reality, oh yes, you are
More than just the love talkin'
Hey girl, we've got it workin', workin', workin'

Never had a love like this before
Oh, I never had a love like this before
Never had a love like this before
Oh, I never had a love

I'm so glad that I was patient
Lord, sent me your heavenly creation, oh yes, he did
You're all I needed, needed, yeah
Oh, but it's all I conceded

Never had a love like this before
Oh, I never had a love like this before
Never had a love like this before
Oh, I never had a love

Love's in your tender touch
Cause everyday askin' for too much
Oh, I'm in love with what you doin'
Never get tired, I'ma watchin' you

Never had a love like this before
Oh, I never had a love like this before
Never had a love like this before
Oh, I never had a love

I've been in a lotta situation
But never like this before, oh no
There's been so much, so much anticipation
(?) and everybody needs it

Everybody's lookin' for a good situation
Uptown, downtown, all around the world
Lookin' for the right girl
Hopin' an' prayin', oh, some never find it

Right boy or the right girl
Looking for the right boy, looking for the right girl
Hear what the fellas are sayin'
Never, never ever, ever, ever, never had a love like this before

Never, never, no, no
Never, never ever, ever, ever
Ever had a love like this before
Do you hear what fellas are sayin'?

Never had a love like this before
Oh, I never had a love like this before
Never had a love like this before
Oh, I never had a love

Never had a love like this before
Oh, I never had a love like this before
Never had a love like this before
Oh, I never had a love

Never had a love like this before
Oh, I never had a love like this before
Never had a love like this before
Oh, I never had a love
