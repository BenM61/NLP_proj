I'm feelin' happy
So highly evolved
My time's a riddle that'll never be solved
Dreamin' for somethin'
Reachin' for somethin'
Just waitin' for the sun to carry me in

If you feel low
You can buy love
From a pay phone
I don't feel low

My brother Bill
He work for the market
Life is an arrow now and he is the target
Dreamin' for somethin'
Reachin' for somethin'
Just waitin' for the sun to carry me in

If you feel low
You can buy blow
From a pay phone
I don't feel low

Highly Evolved
Highly Evolved
Highly Evolved
Highly Evolved

I don't feel low

Highly Evolved
