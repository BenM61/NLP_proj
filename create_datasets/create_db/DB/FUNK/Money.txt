I get a little worried when you focus on my money
Money, money, money, money
All the kissin' and the huggin' actin' like you're my best buddy
Buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy
Better not say it loud
Dippin' around, walkin' on eggshells
With my money
Money, money, money, money
I may just buy me a dress cause I invest 
Stackin my pennies when things get stormy
Stormy, stormy, stormy stormy
Can't wait, can't wait
To roll with me to the bank
But I wait, yes I wait
I think I'll go out on a date

You think that I'm your momma
Now you just actin' crazy
Crazy, crazy crazy crazy 
You better go find you a job
You better stop actin' lazy
Lazy, lazy lazy lazy

I'm lovin' it makin' it move
'Cause I feel proud that I'm a independent lady
Lady lady lady lady
I may just buy me a dress cause I invest

Stackin' my pennies when things get stormy 
Stormy, stormy stormy stormy 
Can't wait, Can't wait
To roll with me to the bank
But I wait, Yes I wait
I think I'll go out on a date

Money, yes I love you (l love you)
Money, (yes), yes I need you (I need you) 
I'm lovin' it makin it move
'Cause I feel proud that I'm a independent lady
Lady lady lady lady
I may just buy me a dress cause I invest
Stackin' my pennies when things get stormy 
Stormy, stormy stormy stormy 
Can't wait, can't wait
To roll with me to the bank
But I wait, yes I wait
I think I'll go out on a date
Can't wait, Can't wait
To roll with me to the bank
But I wait, yes I wait
I think I'll go out on a date
