Baby I want you by my side to be forever
Without you I can never face the stormy weather
Am I living this paradise for someone to say it's wrong
Am I burning this love too bright when you don't hold on so long

Oh am I living a lie am I too hung up on you

Baby be the bitter end live without you
I get lonely to pass the time and doubt never on you
Am I living this paradise for someone to say it's wrong
Am I burning this love too bright when you don't hold on so long

Oh am I living a lie am I too hung up on you

Am I wasting my time am I loosing my mind yeah
I can't hold on so long I don't wanna be wrong again

Am I living this paradise for someone to say it's wrong
Am I burning this love too bright when you don't hold on so long
Oh am I living a lie am I too hung up on you
Oh am I living a lie am I too hung up on you
Oh am I living a lie am I too hung up on you
