For a while, to love was all we could do
We were young and we knew, and our eyes were alive
Deep inside we knew our love was true
For a while we paid no mind to the past
We knew love would last
Every night somethin' right 
Would invite us to begin the dance
Somethin' happened along the way
What used to be happy was sad
Somethin' happened along the way 
And yesterday was all we had

Oh, after the love has gone
How could you lead me one
And not let me stay around?
Oh, after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?
 
For a while to love each other
With all we would ever need
Love was strong for so long
Never knew that what was wrong
Baby, wasn't right
We tried to find what we had 
Til sadness was all we shared
We were scared this affair 
Would lead our love into
Somethin' happened along the way
Yesterday  was all we had
Somethin' happened along the way
What used to be happy is sad
Somethin' happened along the way
What used to be was all we had

Oh, after the love has gone
How could you lead me on
And not let me stay around?
Oh, oh, after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?

Oh, oh, after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found
Oh, oh, after the love has gone
