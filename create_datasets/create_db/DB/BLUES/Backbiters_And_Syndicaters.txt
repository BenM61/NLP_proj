Back biters and syndicators
Standing all around the door
Back biters and syndicators
Standing all around the door

An' it wished 'bout ev'ryday
Hopin' I'd go way to stay 
Ooo-ooo-wee, ooo
Almost ruin my happy home
Ooo-wee-ooo
Almost ruin my happy home

I be glad when the day come
You leave these syndicators alone
I can't understand, little girl
That they don't mean you no good
I can't understand, little girl
That you don't know they don't mean you no good
You'll find these kind-a people
In any neighborhood

Back biters and syndicators
Can't you see 'em standin' 'round the do'?
Back biters and the syndicator
Can't you see 'em standin' 'round the do'?
I'm gonna move on down the line
I don't have to be bothered no mo'
