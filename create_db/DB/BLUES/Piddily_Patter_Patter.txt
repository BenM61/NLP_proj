My heart goes Piddily Patter, Patter
Piddily Patter, Patter
Every time I look at you
Don't I know a what's the matter, matter
What's the matter 'bout Piddily Patter Boo Boo

My eyes go Flippedy Flatter, Flatter
Flippedy Flatter, Flatter
Every time I see you smile
My heart goes Piddily Patter, Patter
Piddily Patter, Patter
Piddily Patter all the while

I guess it's cause you're lovely
I guess it's cause you're sweet
I guess it's cause you're the prettiest little girl
My eyes will ever meet

I wish I had a Penny
For every Pitter Pat
I'd have so many Pennies, Baby
That I wouldn't know where they was at

My heart goes Piddily Patter, Patter
Piddily Patter, Patter
Every time I think of you
Don't I know a what's the matter, matter
What's the matter but I think it's cause I love you

Believe me when I tell you
Believe me when I say
My heart has felt some funny little things
But I never felt this way

When you broke off and leave me
I don't feel nothing then
When you're near I swear my Dear
The same thing starts again

My heart goes Piddily Patter, Patter
Piddily Patter, Patter
Every time I look at you
Don't I know a what's the matter, matter
What's the matter but I think it's cause I love you

Piddily Patter, Patter'
