I'm a little used to calling outside your name
I won't see you tonight so I can keep from going insane
But I don't know enough
I get some kinda lazy day
Hey now

I've been fabulous through to fight my town a name
I'll be stooped tomorrow if I don't leave as them both the same
But i don't know enough
I get some kinda lazy day
Hey now

Cause it's hard for me to lose, in my life I've found only time will tell how to figure out
How we can, baby, how we can do a one night stand

Yeah

And it's hard for me to lose in my life,
I've found outside your skin right near the fire
How we can baby, how we can change and feel alright

I'm a little used to wondering outside the rain
You can leave me tomorrow if it suits you just the same
But I don't know enough
I need someone who leaves the day
Hey, yeah

Cause it's hard for me to lose, in my life
I've found only time will tell how to figure out
How we can, baby, how we can do a one night stand

Yeah

And its hard for me to lose in my life,
I've found outside your skin right near the fire
How we can baby, how we can change and feel alright

Cause it's hard for me to lose, in my life
I've found only time will tell how to figure out
How we can, baby, how we can do a one night stand

Yeah

And it's hard for me to lose in my life,
I've found outside your skin right near the fire
How we can baby, how we can change and feel alright

Cause it's hard for me to lose, in my life
I've found only time will tell how to figure out
How we can, baby, how we can do a one night stand

Yeah

And it's hard for me to lose in my life,
I've found outside your skin right near the fire
How we can baby, how we can change and feel alright
