Well, I came upon a child of god
He was walking along the road
And I asked him, "where are you going?"
And this he told me

I'm going on down to Yasgur's Farm
I'm gonna join in a rock and roll band
I got to get back to the land
And set my soul free

We are stardust
We are golden
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden

Though can I walk beside you?
I have come here to lose the smog
And I feel to be a cog in something turning

Now maybe it is just the time of year
Or maybe it's the time of man
And I don't know who I am
But life is for learning

We are stardust
We are golden
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden

We are stardust
We are golden
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden

By the time we got to Woodstock
We were half a million strong
And everywhere there was song and celebration

And I dreamed I saw the bombers
Riding shotgun in the sky
Turning into butterflies
Above our nation

We are stardust
We are golden
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden, alright 
Oh back to the garden oh now
Gonna back, going back, gonna back to the garden
