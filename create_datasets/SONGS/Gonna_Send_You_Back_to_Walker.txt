You had nothin' when I met you, baby
But look what you got now
Sometimes I wonder, did I make a mistake
When I brought you to the South?

Gonna send you back to Walker
Girl, that's where you belong
Since you been got in the big city
Well, you been startin' treatin' me wrong

Your mama and your daddy done told me, baby
Not to bring you to the South
I brought you to the city
And the bright lights knocked you out

I'm gonna send you back to Walker
Girl, that's where you belong, I know
Since you been got in the big city
Well, you been startin' treatin' me wrong

Your mama and your daddy done told me, baby
Not to bring you to the South
I brought you from the city
And the bright lights knocked you out

I'm gonna send you back to Walker
Girl, that's where you belong, I know, baby
Since you been got in the big city
Well, you been startin' treatin' me wrong

I know you been treatin' me wrong
Ah, so long
I'm gonna send you back where you belong
All right, all right
Put you down
Send you back home
Goodbye
