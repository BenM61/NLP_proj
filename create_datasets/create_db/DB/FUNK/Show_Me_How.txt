I'm just a young girl
Dying to learn the ways of love
Just to please you
You're the only someone I love
Come on and teach me

There are so many things
That I, I just don't know
But I, I love you, love you, love you so
So the things I don't know
Show me how

I don't wanna lose
Someone sweet just like you
For you make me feel like a queen
I wanna make you feel like a king
Show me how

You know I want you
How bad I need you
I want to kiss you right now

If I don't move you
Wanna try to soothe you
And darling, please show me how

There are so many things
That I, I just don't know, oh
But I, I love you, love you, love you so
So the things I don't know
Show me how

Show me, show me, show me
Show me how
Show me, show me, show me
Show me how

Show me, show me, show me
Show me how
Show me, show me, show me
Show me how

Show me, show me, show me
Show me how
Show me, show me, show me
Show me how
