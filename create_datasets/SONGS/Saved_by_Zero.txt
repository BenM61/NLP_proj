Maybe someday, saved by zero
I'll be more together
Stretched by fewer thoughts that leave me
Chasing after my dreams, disown me, loaded with danger
 
So maybe I'll win (saved by zero)
Maybe I'll win (saved by zero)
Holding onto words that teach me
I will conquer space around me
 
So maybe I'll win (saved by zero)
Maybe I'll win (saved by zero)
Maybe I'll win (saved by zero)
Maybe I'll win (saved by zero)

(Saved by zero, saved by zero)

So maybe I'll win (saved by zero)
Maybe I'll win (saved by zero)
Maybe I'll win (saved by zero)
Who needs to win (saved by zero)

Saved by, saved by, save-saved by zero
Saved by, saved by, save-saved by zero
Saved by, saved by, save-saved by zero (saved by zero)
Saved by, saved by, save-saved by zero
Saved by, saved by, save-saved by zero
Saved by zero (saved by, saved by, save-saved by zero)
