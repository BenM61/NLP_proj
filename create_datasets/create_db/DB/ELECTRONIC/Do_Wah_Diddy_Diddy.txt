[Chorus:]
There she was just a - walking down the street
Singin' doh wah diddy diddy dam diddy doh
Snapping her fingers and shuffling to the beat
Singin' doh wah diddy diddy dam diddy doh

Doin' the do
She looks good
She looks fine
And she nearly blew my mind

Doh wah diddy dam diddy doo
Check out the groove
And the beat is gonna move you
Shake it shake it shake it
Until you get crazy
But just don't fake it
So you want me to shake it
So I'll take it grab the mic
And I sure won't fake it
Me and my boy smooth t
We get down
With the beat
It's the doh wah diddy sound
Let this beat just spin you around
Get up and stand up and move
To this sound
Let this rhythm control
Your feet it's the factory of fun
You need
Unique styles is what we're bringing you
'Cause we can blow up
Why'll I came to do
A brand new style for
The dance floor
'Cause I got more you
Want more

Get your booties on
The floor get down what
You're waiting for?
Wave your hands from here to there
To the rhythm up
Yes in the air all the ladies
Scream all the fellows ho
'Cause I got the flow and I'm about to go
So I pass to smooth t
'Cause he's got the flow

Pump it pump it up the speaker
Let the bass hit you
Straight and deeper
Can you stand can you stand the power? 
After this all you'll need is a shower 
So pass me the soap
And let me wash stuff up 'g'
The doh wah diddy dance
Is made for you and me
So party people just get on up
'Cause our second has come
With a brand new cut
