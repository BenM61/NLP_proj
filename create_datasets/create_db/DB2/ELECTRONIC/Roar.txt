Someone's always telling me I'm no good 
Well I don't care what you say 
Someone's always giving me a hard time 
Well I live day to day 
Someone's always putting me in my place 
Like I don't know where I am 
So I'll just sit here in the corner without any direction 

Maybe it's all it's all in my head 
I think that it's something something you said 
I understand some things will never change (Never Change) 
Never change 

Someone's always kicking me to the curb 
Well it's grinding up my face 
Someone's always pushing me to the side 
Like I'm standing in the way 
Someone's always getting up in my face 
L:ike I don't know who I am 
So once again I'm in the corner without any direction 

Maybe it's all it's all in my head 
I think that it's something something you said 
Understand some things will never change (Never change, Never change) 
Somebody's always out to get me 
Somebody's always trying to kill me 
Understand some things will never change (Never change, Never change) 

Why did you have to go and change? 
Couldn't you just have stayed the same? 
Why did you have to go insane? 
Understand some things don't change 
Never change 
No they don't  No they don't  Don't change 

Maybe it's all it's all in my head 
I think that it's something something you said 
Understand some things will never change 
Somebody's always out to get me 
Somebody's always trying to kill me 
Understand some things will never change 

Why did you have to go and change? 
Couldn't you just have stayed the same? 
Why did you have to go insane? 
Understand some things don't change 
Why did you have to go and change? 
Couldn't you just have stayed the same? 
Why did you have to go insane? 
Understand some things don't change 

Some things will never change 
Some things never change 
Some things never change 
Never change
