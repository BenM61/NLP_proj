Tell the taxi driver pull up over there
Sprint down the street and we don't pay the fare
Onto the district line, force open the door
There's loadsa seats free but we cotch on the floor

Last night we both died a death
Just flowed til no cider left
Jumped out the wrong side of bed
Now another night of wrong lies ahead, ha
To be a kid again, Nancy and Sid again
Need medicine, cut out the middle men
Run free, only way to get rid of them
Never gonna catch us

We're on the run
And I'm about to lose it
Shes like a gun
And she ain't afraid to use it

We'll catch our very last train
Light our very last flames
And we'll knock it all back and forget our names
Cos its our last night
And its one last fight
We're the last ones
The last ones standing

Go tell the waitress, we'll have 2 rum and cokes
Ask for the bill and then we'll split when she goes
Out the fire exit wearing some strangers coat
We'll sing it out til we're sore in the throat

This ain't child's play like pass the parcel or
Build a castle, just a couple of rascals who
Go harder, live faster
Fight til the end like Jason's Argonauts
Cos life's a carnival
There's no reason, motives marginal
Don't care if we're cold and starvin'
We'll still be laughin' when

We're on the run
And I'm about to lose it
Shes like a gun
And she ain't afraid to use it

We'll catch our very last train
Light our very last flames
And we'll knock it all back and forget our names
Cos its our last night
And its one last fight
We're the last ones
The last ones standing

We're on the run

We'll catch our very last train
Light our very last flames
And we'll knock it all back and forget our names
Cos its our last night
And its one last fight
We're the last ones
The last ones standing
