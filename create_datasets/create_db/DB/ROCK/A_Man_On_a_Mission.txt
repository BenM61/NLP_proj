Less talk, more action with no distractions
I am all conditioned, thoroughbred
Go for the action with no distractions, yeah

You give every inch, flesh, blood and bone
And it's all wrapped up in a tight little bundle
Got an open mind, do anything

Ow, uh

No distractions, I got no distractions
