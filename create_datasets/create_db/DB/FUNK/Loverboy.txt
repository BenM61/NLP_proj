I don't know what you've got but it plays with my emotions
I want you so much
Darling I want to hold you near
Want to whisper sweet and tender in your ear
Can't stand the thought of you with somebody else
Got to have your love got to have it all to myself
I say yeah yeah yeah yeah

Want to be your lover lover
Want to be your lover lover lover boy
Lover lover
Want to be your lover lover lover boy

Too far gone it's hard to stop
Baby you're my dream in motion and I won't give up
Teasing me with your fire
My finger's on the trigger
Your the one I desire
'Cause I have this feeling feeling from nobody else
Got to have your tenderness all to myself
I say yeah yeah yeah yeah

Want to be your lover lover
Want to be your lover lover lover boy
Lover lover, yeah

And I want you really but the thing is there's nothing I can say
To stop you darling from running running away
Won't you stay stay stay yeh

I want to be your love

Gotta have your love
