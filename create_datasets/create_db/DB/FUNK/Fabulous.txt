Young cat got back, did a little bid
Now he hard, he buff,  he tough, doo rag and Timbs
Kinda hard to get a job back out on the block
Charge that to the game
Young girl she grew up in a rush
Had it bad, no dad, she don't know who to trust
Every man she ever loved only want to crush
Charge that to the game
But it's all gravy, hey baby
Shots get popped, the cops shut down the party
Jeans sag low, blow smoke out of Dutches
We've got love for y'all but y'all don't love us
So we swerve in the Suburban switchin' lanes
Spend up all our dough on them chrome and thangs
Name our kids some funny names
Don't hate on us, we're fabulous
Prepaid cellies for local calls
Lil' don and divas up at the mall
Rockin' cornrow twist, that's how we roll
But don't hate on us, we're fabulous

They met, he said how she was a dime
So naive that she believed every single line
17, first time slipped up, 'bout to have a child
Charge that to the game
Was just us and mom, single family home
She did the best she could, did it all her own
Met a man but he won't raise a child that's not his own
Oh, no, oh, no, no
But it's all gravy, hey baby
Shots get popped, the cops shut down the party
Jeans sag low, blow smoke out of Dutches
We've got love for y'all but y'all don't love us
So we swerve in the Suburban switchin' lanes
Spend up all our dough on them chrome and thangs
Name our kids some funny names
Don't hate on us, we're fabulous
Pre-pay cellulars for local calls
Lil dons and divas up at the malls
Rockin' cornrow twist, that's how we roll
But don't hate on us, we're fabulous
With all that we've got
And no matter whatever together we'll weather the storm
And meanwhile with all we got it might get rough, but
It's alright

'Cause U-N-I-T-Y is all we need
To get are-E-S-P-E-C-T
And never G-I-V-E U-P
And keep your H-E-A-D U-P
And never G-I-V-E U-P
And keep your H-E-A-D U-P
And never G-I-V-E U-P
And keep your H-E-A-D U-P
And never G-I-V-E U-P
And keep your H-E-A-D U-P
And never G-I-V-E U-P
And keep your H-E-A-D U-P
