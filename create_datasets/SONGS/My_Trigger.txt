I saw you licking a dollar bill
I'm in the graveyard if looks could kill
But murder ain't your thing, you just shoot to thrill
But if you did, put you in my will, will

Baby let's forget the  money, forget the  money
Where you're winning
Baby we could chase the sun, you got me gunning
Pull my trigger

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

They say your body is full of sin
But they can't see the world that we're in
Your body is the portal where peace begins
I give you more, we can take a spin, spin

Baby let's forget the  money, forget the  money
Where you're winning
Baby we could chase the sun, you got me gunning
Pull my trigger

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh

I got paid and all my dreams came
True, true, true
Now we're waiting in my car for you
You, you

I saw you licking a dollar bill
I'm in the graveyard if looks could kill
But murder ain't your thing, you just shoot to thrill
But if you did, put you in my will, will

Baby let's forget the  money, forget the  money
Where you're winning
Baby we could chase the sun, you got me gunning
Pull my trigger
Baby let's forget the  money, forget the  money
Where you're winning
Baby we could chase the sun, you got me gunning
Pull my trigger

Oh oh oh, oh ohoh
Oh, oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
