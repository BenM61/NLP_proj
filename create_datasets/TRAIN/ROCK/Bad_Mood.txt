Better to be ready if you rattle my cage,
Oh I should loosen up some, baby I know.
But I get angrier with age,
Better to be ready if you rattle my cage.

Oh you look disappointed in me,
Oh am I not as thoughtful as you thought I'd be?
Yeah I know I'm always giving you the third degree,
But you look disappointed in me.

Now I'm in a bad, bad mood; a bad, bad mood.
I'm in a bad, bad mood; a bad, bad mood.

We'll rate, generate, generate some more,
So what you singing about summer for?
Forgive me if I'm onto one,
And I'll afford it but I suspect,
That retrospect to your perception,
You're looking in the wrong direction.
As I'm sure you'll come through,
I'm in a pretty awful mood.

Better to be ready if you rattle my cage,
And I know I'm always putting it on you.
But I get angrier with age,
Better to be ready if you rattle my cage.

Now I'm in a bad, bad mood; a bad, bad mood.
I'm in a bad, bad mood; a bad, bad mood.

I'm in a bad, bad mood; a bad, bad mood.
