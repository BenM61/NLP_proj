Children with candyfloss 
And prizes of goldfish 
Young men kill tin ducks 
In sharp shooter poses 
The laughter of the lovers 
On the rickety stairs 
The rumble of the diesel 
And the sounds of the fair 
 
An old gypsy lady 
In soft Spanish whispers 
Took my hands in hers 
And told me their secrets 
Your heart is a fire 
And his love is an ember 
You must forget 
What you'll always remember
 
Superstitious nonsense 
Just a fairground attraction 
I walked through the neons 
In search of distraction 
But the tears in my eyes 
Knew the truth in my heart 
She'd only confirmed 
What I knew at the start 
 
Oh-ah-ah-ah 
Ah-ah-ah 
Ah-ah-ah
