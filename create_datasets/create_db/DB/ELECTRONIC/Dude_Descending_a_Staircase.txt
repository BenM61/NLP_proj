We got a party right here
Bacardi or beer
Whatever is your choice
It's fun for the girls and boys
Tell your girl to come here
It's the Nuts World Premiere
Exclusive don't overdose and abuse it
This music is like ecstasy
I got the recipe, the remedy
Please don't cock block like a referee
Blast off into space
Who's in the place to be?
The world's famous Beatnuts and the Four Forty
Let's go

New York, New York is what the people in the clubs say
Beatnuts they get it packed like the subway
Keep movin' no standin' around
All the ladies put your coats and your bags on the ground
Let's go have a drink baby see what you feel
It's Apollo and tonight we're gonna party for real
C'mon fine woman won't you back that thing up
There's a party in my pants baby pop that thing up

You know and I know and you know and I know
It's Juju and psycho, it's Juju and psycho
And you know and I know and you know and I know
We party we bullshit we party we bullshit

What you say?
'Cause it sounded like 'more champagne'
And there's plenty more from where that came
Get your mind right enjoy life in the limelight
I'm imported unstoppable and I rhyme tight
Guarantee you we're gonna rock the show
Get the money and the girls and we have to go
Apollo Four Four O you gotta know
Ha ha! We're gonna blow

Work it out mama let me see your fatty shake
Let me smack it up like patty cake
This is the jump off
So don't try to jump the gun
And jump the broom
Try to block my jump shot
Stick to the jump rope
Reign of the tech
Smell the gunsmoke, don't choke
I like cities with bitties with titties like Britney's
That smoke out like hippies
Get drunk and striptease
And never turnin' down the quickies
Hit me

New York, New York is what the people in the clubs say
Beatnuts they get it packed like the subway
Keep movin' no standin' around
All the ladies put your coats and your bags on the ground
Let's go have a drink baby see what you feel
It's Apollo and tonight we're gonna party for real
