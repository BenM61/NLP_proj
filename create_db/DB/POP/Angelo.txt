Long ago, 
High on a mountain in Mexico
Lived a young shepherd boy, Angelo
Who met a young girl and he loved her so

Rich was she,
Came from a very high family,
Angelo knew it could never be,
They ran away to their destiny

Running away together
Running away forever
Angelo 
Running away from danger
Hiding from every stranger
Angelo
They knew it wasn't wrong
They found a love so strong
They took their lives at night
And in the morning light
They found them on the sand
They saw them lying there, hand-in-hand
