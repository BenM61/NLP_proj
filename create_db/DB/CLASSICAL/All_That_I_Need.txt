you're crying night and day 
you wonder how you ever lost your way 
nothing matters, you must survive 
you heart is slowly dying and so you cry 

(chorus)
all that i need is love 
from the moment i wake 
let me feel your embrace 
all that i need is love 
hold me closer each day, every step of the way 

like flowers need the rain to live 
a bright beginning lord, the greatest gift you give 
you changed my, life forever 
lover of my life, i realize 

when the morning comes and the sun rises to the sky 
all my troubles will be over and the way made easy 
until then all i need is to know you'll always hear me 
when i call out your name, call out your name
