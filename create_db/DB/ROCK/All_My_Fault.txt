I guess we've had our fun but it seems our fun is over now and that's alright, it's alright 
Time for me to move along and, after all is said and done I'll be alright, and it's alright 
Tell me something that's sure to break my heart
Cause everything's my fault 
And I know I deserve to be alone 
Cause everything's my fault, 
Here we go again unsuccessful
To make amends but that's all right and it's all right 
I've tried as hard as I can but I can't can't seem to understand
 oh it's all right and it's all right 
Tell me something that's sure to break my heart 
Cause everything's my fault 
And I know I deserve to be alone cause everything's my fault 
I guess it's over now your honesty has all run out but that's alright and it's alright 
I just can't seem to see how the hell you can make believe that it's alright and it's alright 
Tell me something that's sure to break my heart 
Cause everything's my fault 
And I know I deserve to be alone cause everything's my fault 
And everything's my fault 
And everything's my fault 
And everything's my fault 
And everything's my fault
