Hey
Money, money
Money on my mind
Money, money
Money on your mind
To the boats we're all criminals here
And that big wall is the new frontier

Well, DonaldTrumpMakesMeWannaSmokeCrack
Go to Canada and never come back
Where you gone
Betty Friedan?
Where you gone
Gore Vidal, hey?

Money, money
Money on my mind
Money, money
Money on your mind
To the boats we're all immigrants here
And that big wall is the new frontier

Hold up, hold up
Let me off
Hold up, hold up
This train won't stop
Hold up, hold up
Let me off
To ya'll , this train won't stop

Middle finger in the air
If you're feeling like I
Middle finger in the air
If you're feeling like I do
Feeling like I do
If you're feeling like I do
Feeling like I do

Money, money
Money on my mind
Money, money
Money on your mind
To the boats
We're all immigrants here
And that big wall is the new frontier

I said, DonaldTrumpMakesMeWannaSmokeCrack (hey)
Go to Canada and never come back (hey)
Where you gone
Betty Friedan? (hey)
Where you gone
Gore Vidal?

Middle finger in the air
If you're feeling like I
Middle finger in the air
If you're feeling like I do
Feeling like I do
If you're feeling like I do
Feeling like I do
