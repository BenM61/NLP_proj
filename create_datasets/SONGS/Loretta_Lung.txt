The crickets cry tonight 
Here comes your girl 
The showers fall tonight 
It's a rainy world 

The shivers on the spine 
Could be what we had in mind 
Remember all the times we said 
We could be we should be in love 

On a windy porch tonight 
Here comes your girl 
Beneath the dull porch light 
Your thoughts will curl 
Past the women and the men 
To where the story ends 
The voice from up above says 
We could be we should be in love 

My disgusting habits end 
It's a crazy world 
Neither real nor pretend 
And there's your girl

My eyes fall from my head 
With all the pages read 
And I'm so glad you said 
We could be we should be in love
