Because, because I'm weary of this melody
Because, because I want to get up off my knees
Because, because I'm tired of chasing you around
Because, because I'm lying prostate on the ground

And when I'm tired I am so very tired
And when it's done it's like I've killed someone

Because, because I'm sick of all the bones you throw
Because, because there's nothing from the seed you sow
Because, because I can't remember why I'm here
Because, because it's all become so crystal clear

And when I'm tired I am so very tired
And when it's done it's like I've killed someone

Because, because, because, because
Because, because, because, because
Because, because, because, because
Because, because, because, because

And when I'm tired I am so very tired
And when it's done it's like I've killed someone

Because, because I'm weary of this melody
Because, because I want to get up off my knees
Because, because I'm tired of chasing you around
Because, because I'm lying prostate on the ground

Because, because I'm sick of all the bones you throw
Because, because there's nothing from the seed you sow
Because, because I can't remember why I'm here
Because, because it's all become so crystal clear

Because, because, because, because
Because, because, because, because
