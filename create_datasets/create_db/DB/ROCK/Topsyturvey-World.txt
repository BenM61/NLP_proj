If the butterfly courted the bee
And the owl the porcupine
If churches were built in the sea
And the three times one was nine

Then the world would be Upside-Down, yes
The world would be Upside-Down
What a topsyturvey world this would be
The world would be Upside-Down, yeah
The world would be Upside-Down

If the pony rode his master
And if buttercups ate the cows
If the cat had the dire disaster
To be worried by the mouse

Then the world would be Upside-Down, yes
The world would be Upside-Down
What a topsy turvy world this would be
The world would be Upside-Down, yeah
The world would be Upside-Down
The world would be Upside-Down, yeah
The world would be Upside-Down

If mama sold the baby
To a gypsy for half a crown
If a gentleman was a lady
Then the world would be Upside-Down

And the world would be Upside-Down, yes
The world would be Upside-Down
What a topsyturvey world this would be
The world would be Upside-Down, yeah
The world would be Upside-Down
The world would be Upside-Down, yeah
The world would be Upside-Down

And if any or all of these wonders
Should ever come about
I consider them blunders, no
I should be Inside-Out
Yeah I should be Inside-Out

The world would be Upside-Down, yeah
The world would be Upside-Down
The world would be Upside-Down, yeah
The world would be Upside-Down

The world would be Upside-Down, yeah
The world would be Upside-Down
The world would be Upside-Down, yeah
The world would be Upside-Down

Just imagine
The owl and the porcupine
Churches were built in the sea

If the butterfly courted the bee
The owl and the porcupine
If churches were built in the sea
The three times one was nine

Just imagine
Three times one was nine

If the butterfly courted the bee
The owl and the porcupine
If churches were built in the sea
The three times one was nine

If the pony rode his master
Then the world would be Upside-Down
Upside-Down
I mean really Upside-Down
