I want a full-time job makin' love to you
I'll do anything you want me to

But if you have no plan to use a full-time man
A part-time job will do

I want a full-time job bein' close to you
Makin' all your dreams come true

But if your heart don't throb about a full-time job
A part-time job will do

You wouldn't, you wouldn't have to pay me
A nickel or a dime

As long as you would let me (DORIS: Do what?)
Give myself a little bit of crazy overtime

I want a full-time job holdin' hands with you
I think you'd kinda like it too

Don't want a part-time job, I want a full-time job
But a part-time job will do

I want a full-time job makin' love to you

I'll do anything you want me to

But if you have no plan to use a full-time man

A part-time job will do

I want a full-time job bein' close to you

Makin' all your dreams come true

But if your heart don't throb about a full-time job

A part-time job will do

You wouldn't, you wouldn't have to pay me
A nickel or a dime

But baby, if you'd let me, then I know you won't forget me
And it isn't any crime to have a gratis overtime

I want a full-time job holdin' hands with you
I think you'd kinda like it too

Don't need a part-time job, I want a full-time job
But a part-time job will do

There wouldn't be no point in livin'
And I know we'll be forgivin'
It's a full-time job with you
