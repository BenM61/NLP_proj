Sometimes, I feel you
Looking for the devil in me.
Like I'm a dying dog and
I'm begging for your bones.
I swear I feel you looking
For the devil in me.
So won't you close your eyes, 
When I'm lying in your heart.

Sometimes, I feel you
Looking for the devil in me.
Like I'm a dying dog
And I'm beggin' for your bones.
I swear I feel you
Looking for the devil in me.
So won't you close your eyes, 
When I'm lying in your heart.

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, 
La, la, la, la, la, la, 
La, la, la, la, la, la, 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, 
La, la, la, la, la, la, 
La, la, la, la, la, la, 
La, la, la, la, la, la, La, la, 
La, la, la, la, la, la, 
La, la, la, la, la, la, 

Ohh Sometimes, I feel you
Looking for the devil in me.
Like I'm a dying dog
I'm on my knees for your bones.
I swear I feel you
Looking for the devil in me.
Oh so won't you close your eyes, 
When I'm lying in your heart.
