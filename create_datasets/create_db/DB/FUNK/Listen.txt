Listen to the money while it talks,
Makes you feel used up and small.
You're caught between its hands.
Why did you try at all?

I listened and remembered what he said-
"What's good for me is good for you.
Be careful what you wish for-
It might come true."

That sometimes, at night,
When you're alone inside your bed,
You think about the things that have been said.
That sometimes your life begins to go

In directions you don't like.
You can't resist the flow.
If you listen then you might.
Then you might.

Listen once and listen good,
What's lost is never coming back.
The people that you trust
Are the people you should watch.

Ohh and sometimes, at night,
When you're alone inside your bed,
You think about the things that have been said.
That sometimes your life begins to go

In directions you don't know.
Never knew what you would find.
If you listen then you might.

Listen and remember what he said-
"What's good for me is good for you.
Be careful what you wish for-
It might come true."

That sometimes, at night,
When you're alone inside your bed,
You think about the things that have been said.
That sometimes your life begins to go

In directions you don't like.
You can't resist the flow.
If you listen then you might.
Then you might.
