Baby you've been gone a while
I need you here to make me smile
Baby come back
To the sugar shack
Still got your number
It's on the wall
Starting to wonder when you'll call
You know where I'm at
In the sugar shack

It ain't the same without you here
I ain't ashamed of my salty tears
Down by the water, out in the woods
You make it better
You make it good

This ain't no shelter
This ain't no home
No kinda place to be alone
Baby come back
To the sugar shack
I don't know how long
I can keep holding on and on and on
Oh oh

She got you thinking you're safe with her
She ain't as tasty as my sugar
I want you back
At the sugar shack
You got me crawling across the floor
You got me wanting more and more
And more
In my sugar shack

It ain't the same without you here
I ain't ashamed of my salty tears
Down by the water out in the woods
You make it better
You make it good

Su-su-su-su
Su-su oh sugar sugar

This ain't no shelter
This ain't no home
No kinda place to be alone
Baby come back
To the sugar shack
Baby come back
To the sugar shack
Baby come back
Oh oh
To the sugar shack
