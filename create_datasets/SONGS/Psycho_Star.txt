Looking out my window
There's no doubt about it
We don't belong in this world
Be better off without us

Madness and destruction
Maybe that is just who we are
The universe is mostly made of nothing
Isn't it so beautifully bizarre
That here we are

Watching the wind blow
Watching the wind blow
Watching the rain so hard
Watching the fire getting higher
On this strange little star

We were always dreaming
Of castles in the sky
Dreaming of another planet
How could we be so blind?

Chaos and confusion
Maybe that is really all we are
The universe is probably an illusion
But isn't it so beautifully bizarre
That here we are

Watching the wind blow
Watching the wind blow
Watching the rain so hard
Watching the fire getting higher
On this strange little star

Chaos and confusion
Is that really all that we are
The universe is probably an illusion
But isn't it so beautifully bizarre
That here we are

Watching the wind blow
Watching the wind blow
Watching the rain so hard
Watching the fire getting higher
On this strange little star
