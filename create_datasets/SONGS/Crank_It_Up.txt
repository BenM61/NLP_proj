Crank it up, crank it up
Crank it up, crank it up
Crank it up, crank it up
Crank it up, crank it up

We're gonna tear it down, 
We're gonna turn it out, 
We're gonna show you what
This boogie woogie's all about

We're gonna rock the room, 
We're gonna light up the joint
We're gonna have ourselves a party
If you get the point

The boys and me, we got a standing bet
Now we're gonna see just how hot you can get
If this is funk town, we gotta get down
If this is funk town, we gotta get down

Crank it up, crank it up
Crank it up, crank it up
Tight, tight, tighter, crank it up
Crank it up, crank it up

Ain't gonna make no rules
Tellin' right from wrong
Ain't gonna tell your stories
'Bout me when I'm gone

But while I'm still around, 
I'm gonna play my song
Whoever wants to follow me
Can come along

We're gonna have a good time and let it out, 
We're gonna live it up 'cause that's what life is all about
If this is funk town, we gotta get down

If this is funk town, we gotta get down

Crank it up, crank it up
Crank it up, crank it up
Yeah, yeah, crank it up
Crank it up, crank it up

Well it's another time, 
It's just another day, 
But the nights are always nasty
When we start to play

'Cause if there's just one thing
That we can really do, 
Is to belt this boogie
Til the night is through

We're gonna tear it down, we're gonna turn it out, 
Til the whole damn world knows what it's all about
If this is funk town, we gotta get down
If this is funk town, we gotta get down, yeah
If this is funk town, we gotta get down
If this is funk town, we gotta get down

Crank it up, crank it up, whoo! 
Crank it up, crank it up, 
Cr-cr-cr-cr-cr-cr-cr-cr-crank it up, alright now
Crank it up, crank it up, once

Crank it up, crank it up, 
Crank it up, crank it up, we're gonna crank it up, 
Crank it up, crank it up, 
Crank it up, crank it up, crank it up
