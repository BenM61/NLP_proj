Don't sell me no pipe dreams
I wanna live with you through everything
Don't sell me no pipe dreams
I wanna live in a kaleidoscope
Don't sell me no pipe dreams
Wanna be the one to spin the wheel

I know that we can only give
When we have hope
I don't wanna live
Without any goals
Can't protect me from nothing
Can't save me from the truth
You can't even save me from you

So don't sell me no pipe dreams
I wanna feel the good and bad in everything
Even when it hurts, even when it hurts

I know that we can only give
When we got a little hope
But I don't like the burden
Of living with these ghosts
Yes, I will hold my head high
When I walk in your parade
But I will always check my gait
I will always watch my gait

Pipe dreams, pipe dreams
Pipe dreams, pipe dreams
If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on
If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on
If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on, walk on, walk on
If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on
If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on
If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on, walk on, walk on
If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on
If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on
If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on, walk on, walk on
If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on
If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on
If I can't really know you, I'd rather walk on, walk on, walk on
