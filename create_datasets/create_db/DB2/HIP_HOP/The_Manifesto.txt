Hey, lick the tip, why dont'cha

In 1983, a team of crack draw enthusiasts created a master plan.
A design for a way of livin' so revolutionary, so groundbreaking,
That its very concept posed a threat to the fabric of society.

A threat even greater than that of having a stiffy whilst standing
In the middle of a Glyn Williams' coach full of nuns.

Posed a threat to the UK authorities who in turn drove its founder
Members under ground.

Now, for the first time in world 'istory, these shadowy figures of
Chaos reveal, the Manifesto
