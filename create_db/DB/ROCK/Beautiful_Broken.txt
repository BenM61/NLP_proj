She's a big star
And she's burning bright
Losing her religion each and every night
She's the real thing
And she'll tell you so
And lots of other things you don't want to know
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Such a drama queen
A hot mess
Underneath her temper, underneath her dress
Like a raw flame, she got a secret mind
Getting your attention each and every time
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Beautiful broken
Beautiful broken

Na-na-na-na-na, yeah-yeah
Yeah
She's beautiful and broken
Just like you and me
Just like you and me, oh

Such a naughty girl
Throws her body down
Screaming for her daddy but he's not around
Absolution, just a shot away
She don't know she gotta pay to play
(Oh, oh, oh)
Beautiful broken
Beautiful broken
Beautiful broken
Beautiful broken
She's broken
Oh, beautiful broken
Beautiful broken
