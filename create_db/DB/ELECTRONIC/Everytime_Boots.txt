I'll take my time here, there's no reason to rush
I'd even let the cattle ride away--I wouldn't blink an eye
No I wouldn't blink an eye

He walks by me painting a freeway to go far
But I ride his motorcycle round and round him twenty times
I go nowhere twenty times

Oh, every time I do put on boots
I feel the charge like I've a good thing to run to
But I only hear the rattlesnake winds
They blow dust and I'm helpless to fight back

Can you bring me
A fresher perspective please?
Should I be a prouder conqueror
Just bathing in the light?

Oh true it's brighter than
Sky we left years ago
I'll take a photograph and pass it by my eyes
Everytime
I decamp so wearily

Oh, every time I do put on boots
I feel the charge like I've a good thing to run to
But I only hear the rattlesnake winds
They blow dust and I'm helpless to fight back
