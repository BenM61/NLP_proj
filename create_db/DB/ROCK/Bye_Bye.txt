Red velvet loveseat from olden times
There's nobody on it but me
Everyone's cryin they're caught up in games
Me I'm as happy as I've ever been 

So, bye bye my big blue marble
Bye bye my spatial spectral
Bye bye all buddhi sahdfah'd 

Red velvet animals swim in black tea
There's nobody up here but me
And every mistake I make comes back to haunt me
Still I'm as happy as I've ever been 

So bye bye my big blue marble
Bye bye my spatial spectral
Bye bye all buddhi sahdfah'd
Bye bye 

Bye bye my big blue marble
Bye bye my spatial spectral
Bye bye all buddhi sahdfah'd
Bye bye 

Bye bye my big blue marble
Bye bye my spatial spectral
Bye bye all buddhi sahdfah'd
