Join our group and you will find
Harmony and peace of mind
Make you better
We're here to welcome you

We're all on a journey to
Finding the real inner you
Make you better (make you better)
We're here to welcome you

Time stops to whir
You've lost life

[Chorus]
Happiness
How did you get to be
Happiness
How did you get to find
Love, real love
Love, love, love

Footing in the magic world
Donate all your money we'll
Make it better (make it better)
We're here to welcome you

We can see a troubled soul
Give us all your money we'll
Make it better (make it better)
We're here to welcome you

Time stops to whir
You've lost life

[Chorus]

We'll be swimming in the sea
Of wisdom and serenity
Make you better

[Chorus:Repeat x4]
