Some days every word gets in our way
You don't make sense of what I say
And every answer begs another question why
I didn't want to

Maybe I could have changed the way it was
I could have made much more of us
And if I failed perhaps it wasn't just because
I didn't want to

Don't take it as a sign
The stars were out of line
But heaven knows
Whoever I was then
She won't be back again so let her go
But you I wouldn't change
I wouldn't change
I wouldn't change you if I could
It's understood
They got hardboard I got solid wood

Somehow if I am wont to take my time
If I dig in where I should mine
It doesn't build a case for your friends to decide
I didn't want you
Don't take it on yourself
