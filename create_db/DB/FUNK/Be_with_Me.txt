Yo
Look I know we've been,
been friends for a minute
but I think it's time we trust the situation

I know how you feel
you know how I feel
I just wanna put it out there.
(oh baby)(I need you oooh)
I gotta say you're a hell of a woman
Like a new drop in the summer
Pull me over the weather when I'm under,
Did u know, you do that for me
And I wonder sometimes why,
You be taking your time I

I know it's goin' be right
Girl I put that on my life

You be giving me the coldest shoulder
Cause you don't want your emotions taking over
Instead you talking about you Looking for a soldier

Are you trying say you don't see that in me
I know that were friends,
but taking it there wont mess it up
Please just trust in me
Girl I got you cant you see?
(Ohhhh Ohhh)
Baby girl it's killing me
Why you trying to act like you don't
Like you don't see what I see
(You Should Be With)
You Should Be With Me

Fix your heart up,
Before you give it to someone (Ohh)

Someone who don't deserve it,
who's going to hurt it baby

(You Should Be With Me)

Like a scene from my favorite movie
Hard to control myself when you're next to me
If it's against the law to love then sue me
Girl this whole thing got me in disbelief
I know it takes time
To build something that's worth while, But
Just in case you didn't hear me
I'mma say it again more clearly
(I need ya)
Like a bed need some covers
(I need ya)
Baby we need each other

(I need ya)
Like a comedian needs a joke

(I need ya)
Baby I need you the most

(baby)
My heart's beating

Can't you hear it
If I'm the music
You're my lyrics
(oooh)

Baby girl it's killing me (girl it's killing me)
Why you trying to act like you don't (why you trying to act like)
Like you don't see what I see (oooh)

(You Should Be With)
You Should Be With Me

Fix your heart up, (hey)
Before you give it to someone (someone)

Someone who don't deserve it,
who's going to hurt it baby

(You Should Be With Me)
I know you're looking out for you
(but you got ta understand)

That I'm lookin out for us too
(Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh)

So baby you should just give me your heart

And I swear I won't tear it apart
(Nooo)
(ooohh)
Baby girl it's killing me
Why you trying to act like you don't
Like you don't see (like you don't see) what I see (Ohh Ohh Ohh)

(You should be with)
You should be with me
Fix your heart up (baby fix your heart up, before you do with it what you want to),
Before you give it to someone

Someone who's going to hurt it,
who's going to hurt it baby
(I just want to tell you)

(You should be with me)
Baby girl it's killing me (ahaaah)
Why you trying to act like you don't
Like you don't see what I see

Fix your heart up, (oh)
Before you give it to someone

Someone who's going to hurt it,

Why you trying to act like you don't
Like you don't see what I see

Before you give it to someone

Someone who's going to hurt it,
who's going to hurt it baby
