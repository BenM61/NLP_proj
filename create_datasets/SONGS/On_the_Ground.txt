When you see a man, let him be what he's gotta be
'Cause one time is all that he needs
I know for all, is you got to believe in love

Sky above water, they're always the same

Sons and daughters, they're always the same

Always the same

And I never found you on the ground
And I never made a sound
'Cause you were much too busy being free

No time to be with me

And I never found you on the ground
And I never made a sound
'Cause you were much too busy being free
No time to be with me

Hold on to posture and strangers
Hold on to posture and pride
