Love on a mountain top (love on a mountain top)
So high that we won't ever stop (high that we won't ever stop)
Making love on a mountain (do do do do do stop)
Drinking love from a fountain (do do do do do)

Oooh-a-who yeah
You know your daddy's funny he don't go for me
He warned you honey, that our love can't be
I'm from the other side of the mountain girl
But you don't care
And tonight you'll steal away and meet me up there

And we make love on a mountain top (love on a mountain top)
So high that we won't ever stop (high that we won't ever stop)
Making love on a mountain (do do do do do stop)
Drinking love from a fountain (do do do do do)

Your loving this poor boy like I'm some kind of king
When you know I'll never have a doggone thing
But high up on the mountain girl you'll find so much
It's worth a million dollars just to have your touch

And we make love on a mountain top (love on a mountain top)
So high that we won't ever stop (high that we won't ever stop)
Making love on a mountain (do do do do do stop)
Drinking love from a fountain (do do do do do)

Love on mountain top
Love on mountain top

And we make love on a mountain top (love on a mountain top)
So high that we won't ever stop (high that we won't ever stop)
Making love on a mountain (do do do do do stop)
Drinking love from a fountain (do do do do do)
