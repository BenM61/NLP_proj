Dressed only in clothes
From her head to her toes
This is the way
The talking part goes

S-E-X-X-Y
More than enough
Around the clock with nobody else
S-E-X-X-Y

There she is
Standing on the bed
Cookie in one hand, wig on her head
S-E-X-X-Y

X because it's extra baby
why because it's extra baby
Unnoticed by few
Very very few
And that includes you

Look inside your mind
Look inside your eye
Secret agent spy, come to see why
S-E-X-X-Y

One finger nail
Across your back
Baby's first gold tooth initials inscribed
S-E-X-X-Y

X because it's extra baby
why because it's extra baby
You gotta understand
She wants to be your man
She's got another plan
