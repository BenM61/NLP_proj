Did it occur to you
Somebody here's got feelings too
Or did you think that I
Could easily accept the things you do
I guess you didn't even wonder why

Look at me now, you said
A life like this will drive me mad
But did you have to leave
You never thought of me, I bet
But I don't care no more, I'm even feeling free

Working my way back to the world, working with might
and mains
So if you'll ever be in need of me, I'll be out of
range
Of all the dreams we built on jealousy
Just an empty shell remains
And though there's still a lot you're owing me
You can keep the change

Wish you were here tonight
I'm lonely and dissatisfied
Your absence really hurts
Feels like I'm about to lose my pride
It's a pain I can't put into words

I'd better stay away
Before your eyes lead me astray
To throw me back again
To where I used to spend my precious days
Not to be alone was all I thought of then

Working my way back to the world, working with might
and mains
So by the time you'll be in need of me, I'll be out of
range
Of all the dreams we built on jealousy
Just an empty shell remains

And though there's still a lot you're owing me
You can keep the change
