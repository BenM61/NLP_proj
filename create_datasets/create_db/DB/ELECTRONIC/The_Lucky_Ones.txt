We are the lucky ones
And whatever comes
We are the lucky ones
Oh, yeah

We are the lucky ones
And whatever comes
We are the lucky ones

Ooh, ooh-hoo
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh(we are, we are, we are)
Ooh, ooh-hoo 
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh (we are, we are, we are)

Ooh, ooh-hoo (I really love you)
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh (we are, we are, we are)

Ooh, ooh-hoo (I really love you)
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh (we are, we are, we are)

When your world is crumbling down
I can make it better
When your lost, need to be found
I will look forever

For you
For you
For you

We are the lucky ones
And whatever comes
We are the lucky ones

Ooh-hoo, yeah
We are the lucky ones
And whatever comes
We are the lucky ones

When your world is crumbling down
When your lost, need to be found
I will look forever

Just keep me close, there is no storm we can not weather
However how high, however low, I will face forever

For you, for you
For you, for you

We are the lucky ones
And whatever comes
We are the lucky ones

Ooh-ooh, yeah
We are the lucky ones
And whatever comes
We are the lucky ones

Ooh, ooh-ooh (I really love you)
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh (we are, we are, we are)
Ooh, ooh-oho (I really love you)
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh (we are, we are, we are)

Ooh, ooh-ooh (I really love you)
Ooh (we are, we are, we are)

Ooh, ooh-ooh (we are the lucky ones)
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh (we are, we are, we are)
