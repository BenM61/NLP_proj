Livin' with my back against the wall
Nowhere but for
Ward to fall
Well I close my eyes, 
Somebody catch my breath
Oh my lord 
Let's get on board
The rides gonna scare me to death

I don't want to leave before my time is done
Don't want to stick around when my race is run
I don't want to go before they call my dance
Don't want to die asking for another chance

Come help me poor Richard
And won't you help me raise the glass
Here's to me and here's to you
May your dreams all come to pass
Cruel trick of time, 
Is played in the wink of an eye
Well heaven's above you don't need no shove
The years go sailing bye, oh

I don't want to leave before my time is done
Don't want to stick around when my race is run
I don't want to go before they call my dance
Don't want to die asking for another chance

Another game of chance
A lifetime come and gone
I guess it's up to me
If I don't want to say another man's song
I want to say what grandma said, 
Lying on her dying bed
I ain't been cheated, no mistreated, 
And I don't have to say that yet, oh

I don't want to leave before my time is done
Don't want to stick around when my race is run
I don't want to go before they call my dance
Don't want to die asking for another chance

Another chance
No not another chance
No no another chance
