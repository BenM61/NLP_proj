Hemlock five caught me out there later on
It's the girl I told the man, but he swore he'd prove me wrong
Not seeing as I saw it as I gazed at the skyline
Someone dropped me a dime, someone took the time

I'm not a man with a grasp on reality
Kerouac is whack but I'm down with Dostoevsky
Sugar's got my back plus Beretta .380's
One of which I dropped as the man tried to bait me.

Come on, find yourself.
Its you, its always been you, its always been in you.
Now don't get it messed up, they got me all dressed up.
To feed me to the fishes, I use my mojo for the loco

I know the soft machine and its goings ons and I'll be
Damned if the man's gonna spill me
You want to see me go wild and crazy, I'm sorry man but your
Threats don't phase me. You covered the ground but you're

Lazy. Come on contest me.
Come on, find yourself.
It's you, it's always been you, it's always been in you
