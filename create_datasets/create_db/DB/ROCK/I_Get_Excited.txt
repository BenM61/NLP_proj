Well, you admit you like the game
But you're not gonna play
You just ignore what your body is tryin' to say
I got the feelin' that you're playin'
And we're both gonna win
And I think this angel is about to sin

I get excited
Just thinkin' what you might be like
I get excited
There's heaven in your eyes tonight
The fire's ignited down below
It's burning bright
Oh baby, stay, we got all night, all night
Baby please, I can't please
If I'm on my knees tonight

No baby, you don't look that nervous
When you bite your lip
You keep 'em open when we kiss
You're a hypocrite
You got my body dancin' tangos
In three four time
This angel's gonna spread her wings tonight

I get excited
Just thinkin' what you might be like
I get excited
There's heaven in your eyes tonight
The fire's ignited down below
It's burning bright
Oh baby, stay, we got all night, all night
We got all night, all night
Baby please, I can't please
If I'm on my knees tonight
Tonight, tonight

Baby, I can feel your heart beat
Can't you feel the heat
Baby's got the cold feet, fire below
Oh baby stay we got
Oh baby stay we got

All night, all night
We got, all night, all night
Baby please, I can't please
If I'm on my knees
All night, all night,
We've got, all night, all night
Baby please, I can't please
If I'm on my knees
Tonight, tonight
