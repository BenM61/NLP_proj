So Maybe I am Bound By Fate
A Problematic Scarring Induced By Hate
It Never Seems To All Pan Out
Is That What All This Teaching Is Needed To Scout
You Seemed To Have A Bad Effect
Your Rules And Contradictions I would Neglect
Though Not My Fault You Made Me Feel
Like My Own Education wasn't Truly Real

Then You Came Right In Tearing Out My Soul
How Could All This Loss Be Your Only Goal
I'm Left Standing Here Desperate In The Cold
Since You Took Your Life Mine Has not Been Whole

So There I Stood A Scolded Child
The Reasons Never Questioned My Pains Been Filed
Inside This Place That Makes Me Feel
I learned Life Is Unfair And That Is Very Real

Then You Came Right In Tearing Out My Soul
How Could All This Loss Be Your Only Goal
I'm Left Standing Here Desperate In The Cold
Since You Took Your Life Mine Has not Been Whole

While You Try To Overcome The Lesson
Makeing The most Of Those Questions That Just
Keeps Me Guessing
I'm Looking Longer, Harder, Further Than I Ever Have
Solitude Breaking Me Down You Always Seemed Glad
To Put Me down And Stick Me In That little Pit
Personal Growth As A child That Mattered Not A Bit
Then I Became The Person That You Hated Most
Disrespecting The Father, Son, And Holy Ghost
A Small Example Of What The Things You've Done To Me
Have Changed In My Life And Changed The Things
I'll Never Be
I'll Never Be

Then You Came Right In Tearing Out My Soul
How Could All This Loss Be Your Only Goal
I'm Left Standing Here Desperate In The Cold
Since You Took Your Life Mine Has not Been Whole
