I've seen it with my own eyes
How we're gettin' otherwise
Without the luxury of leavin' (leavin')
The touch and feeling of free is
Un-tangible technically
Something you've got to believe in (believe in)
Connect the cause and effect
One foot in front of the next
This is the start of a journey.
And my mind is already gone
And though there are other unknowns
Somehow this doesn't concern me.

And you can stand right there if you want
But I'm going on
And I'm prepared to go it alone
I'm going on
To a place in the sun that's nice and warm
I'm going on
And I'm sure they'll have a place for you too  oh oh oh 

Anyone that needs what they want, and doesn't want what they need
I want nothing to do with
And to do what I want
And to do what I please
Is first of my to-do list
But every once in a while I think about her smile
One of the few things I do miss
But baby I've to go
Baby I've got to know
Baby I've got to prove it

And I'll see you when you get there
But I'm going on
And I'm prepared to go it alone
I'm going on
May my love lift you up to the place you belong
I'm going on
And I promise I'll be waiting for you oh oh oh
