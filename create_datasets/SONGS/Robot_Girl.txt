Robot girl, robot girl
Robot girl, robot girl
Robot girl, robot girl
Robot girl, robot girl

TV screen faces aren't pretty it's true
But she will do anything I tell her to
Her conversation's not what you'd call clever
But she can't contradict me, oh no never

Robot girl, robot girl
Move your arms a few degrees north
Robot girl, robot girl
Now gently back and forth
Robot girl, robot girl
You know just what to scratch
Robot girl, robot girl
We're such a perfect match
I'm in a whirl, you're my robot girl
I'm in a whirl, you're my robot girl, uh-oh

Programmed for love, she can be quite tender
See how I'm kind, nothing offends her
She vacuums the carpet and doesn't complain
She'll walk the dog in the pouring rain

Robot girl, robot girl
Move your arms a few degrees north
Robot girl, robot girl
Now gently back and forth
Robot girl, robot girl
You know just what to scratch
Robot girl, robot girl
We're such a perfect match
You are my world, you're my robot girl
You are my world, you're my robot girl

Don't have to worry about diamonds and furs
There's no confusion about what's mine and what's hers
When she fixes her limbs on my backside I just shudder
She goes through my blood like a hot knife through butter

Robot girl, robot girl
Move your arms a few degrees north
Robot girl, robot girl
Now gently back and forth
Robot girl, robot girl
Oh, you know just what to scratch
Robot girl, robot girl
We're such a perfect match
You are my world, you're my robot girl
I'm in a whirl, you're my robot girl 
You are my world, you're my robot girl
I'm in a whirl, you're my robot girl
