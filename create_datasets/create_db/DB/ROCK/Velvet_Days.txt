Velvet Days you make your little way
Pouring rain make that face
You make my little day
I laugh till my heart drops down deep
You break your little freak
We break don't we break don't we 

Blush and knock your knees
That's your girl breathing
I laugh till my heart stops
Hold your shark skin thing
That's your boy breathing
I laugh till my heart stops 

Blush and breathe
I laugh till I can't see
Down deep you break you little creep
I laugh 

Listen blush and breathe
That's you soul kissing 
I Laugh
