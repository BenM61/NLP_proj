Want me to love you in moderation
Do I look moderate to you?
Sip it slowly and pay attention
I just have to see it through
You got me looking for validation
Passion's new
Want me to love you in moderation
Well, who do you think you're talking to?

Then bow your head in the house of God
And little girl, who do you think you are?
You think you need it, you think you want love
You wouldn't want it if you knew what it was
Moderation
Moderation
Moderation (Ooh)

I've never made it with moderation
No, I've never understood
All the feeling was all or nothing
And I took everything I could
Can't hold it back, I can't take the tension
Oh, I'm trying to be good
Want me to love you in moderation
Well don't you know, I wish I could

Then bow your head in the house of God
And little girl, who do you think you are?
You think you need it, you think you want love
You wouldn't want it if you knew what it was

Girl, you better learn (I just can't win)
How to hold it in (Can't hold it in)
And girl, you better learn (I just can't win)
And I just can't win (Can't hold it in)
'Cause I don't see the worth (I just can't win)
I don't see the worth
And I'm still try'na figure out if it
Always, always, always has to hurt
(Ahh, ahh, ahh)

You want love
