Weather is in style
To keep the hope
We tread these waters make our waves yes we do,
Peaceful shall proceed
Every symbol week,
Come let's bring light
To the night of day

Weather is in style
To keep the hope
We tread these waters make our waves yes we do,
Peaceful shall proceed
Every symbol week,
Come let's bring light
To the night of day

There comes a time and some will know
A time when true-borns wield their soul
Can you depend on friends to help when you're in need?
Have they got problems of their own?
Look all the silver seasoning shown
Something's are best a left alone
