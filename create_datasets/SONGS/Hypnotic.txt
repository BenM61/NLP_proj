I wanna be on the front line, knotted up suit ties
Talking like a headstrong mamma
Got a picture in your wallet
Making me a habit, wearing your vintage t-shirt
Tied ribbons on your top hat
Telling me I'm all that, just like the girls from your hometown
Sweet blooded and up-stranded, see
If I can stand it, shrinking in the shallow water

Magnetic everything about you
You really got me, now

You took to me so well
Hypnotic taking over me
Make me feel like someone else
You got me talking in my sleep
I don't wanna come back down
I don't wanna touch the ground
Pacific Ocean, dug so deep
Hypnotic taking over me

White threads on my laces, stuck on the hinges
Swinging the door to the backyard
Cut splinters, walk a tightrope
Spun like a bandage touch on the outer surface
Bright eyes of the solstice wherever your mind is headed
For a freight train city
Locked up till you're moonlit
Brushing my hair back, feeling your lips on my cold neck

Magnetic everything about you
You really got me, now

You took to me so well
Hypnotic taking over me
Make me feel like someone else
You got me talking in my sleep
I don't wanna come back down
I don't wanna touch the ground
Pacific Ocean, dug so deep
Hypnotic taking over me
Hypnotic taking over me

You took to me so well
Hypnotic taking over me
Make me feel like someone else
You got me talking in my sleep
I don't wanna come back down
I don't wanna touch the ground
Pacific Ocean, dug so deep
Hypnotic taking over me

Hypnotic taking over me
Hypnotic taking over me
