Open up your door
I can't see your face no more
Love is so hard to find
And even harder to define

Oh, open up your door
Cos we've time to give
And I'm feeling it so much more
Open up the door
Open up your door

Open up the door
I can't hear your voice no more
I just want to make you smile
Maybe stay with you awhile

Oh, open up your door
Cos we've time to give
And my feelings aren't so obscure
Open up the door
Open up your door

So open up the door
Cos we've time to give
And I'm feeling it so much more
Open up your door
Oh, open up your door

Love is so hard to find
And even harder to define

Oh, open up your door
And I've never been so sure
Oh, open up your door
Open up your door
