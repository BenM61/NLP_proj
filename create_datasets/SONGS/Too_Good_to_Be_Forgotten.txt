Too good to be forgotten
Too good to be forgotten.
Benny was a boy I met while walking home one day

He made me forget my marbles

He said he had another game to play.
One thing led to another
Now what more can T sar?
Just one of the reasons why I got him by my side today.

He was too good to be forgotten
Now what more can I say?
Too good to be forgotten
No
I'll never let him get away.
One in a million people
Shout it from the highest steeple.
He's just one of the few
Got my mind

Got my life wrapped up in love!

Well
His hair was shiny
Long and black

It smelled so sweet and bright

I thought of him and dreamed of him all night affer
Night.

I love the ground he walks on
The very air he breathes

I ain't never gonna leave him 'cause I am as happy as
I can be.

He's just too good to be forgotten

Now what more can I say

He was too good to be forgotten
Now what more can I say?
Too good to be forgotten
No
I'Il never let him get away.
He was too good to be forgotten
Now what more can I say?
Too good to be forgotten
No
I'll never let him get away.
He was too good to be forgotten
Now what more can I say?
Fifty million'reasons why I'll never let him get away.
He was too good to be forgotten
Now what more can I say?
Too good to be forgotten
No
I'll never let him get away.
