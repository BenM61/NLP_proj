Tiny children on their own, they learn so fast
How to make new friends, how to play their new games

I remember a man he had shiny hair
Always hanging around when you went away

Little eight year old, she knows too many secrets
Much too young to understand what it means

I remember a woman with silver hair
And the smell and the taste of the bed we shared

And that's how I behaved
Every time that you went away
And now, though I'm older nothing's changed
(playing the same games)

And I knew every day
Came a chance that you'd leave me
So I found what I could to take your place

Told me not to cry
Said that I'd survive
As he waved goodbye

And I want to try
Not to make you cry
Want us to survive
Never say goodbye

But that's how I behave when you go away
Because though I'm older nothing's changed
(Playing the same games)

And I know every day
There's a chance that you'll leave me
So I find what I can to take your place
