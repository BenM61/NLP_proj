Baby, why you gotta act so shy?
You drive me crazy
When you look into my eyes

Well, you don't know my name
And I ain't gonna tell you 'cause it's not my game
I've got you in the palm of my hand
Oh baby I could be your mystery man

Baby, I ain't trying to fill you with doubt
But I'm lazy
So you just gotta figure me out

Well, you don't know my name
And I ain't gonna tell you 'cause it's not my game
I've got you in the palm of my hand
Oh baby I could be your mystery man

Baby, I ain't trying to fill you with doubt
But I'm lazy
So you just gotta figure me out

Well, you don't know my name
And I ain't gonna tell you 'cause it's not my game
I've got you in the palm of my hand
Oh baby I could be your mystery man

Well, you don't know my name
And I ain't gonna tell you 'cause it's not my game
I've got you in the palm of my hand
Oh baby I could be your mystery man
Yes I could be your mystery man
Oh baby I could be your mystery man
Yes I could be your mystery man
