This should go on forever
It should never, ever end
If it's wrong to really love you
I'll forever live in sin

This should go on forever
Let me stay in your arms
Just to gaze into your eyes, dear
And to capture all your charms

If it's sin to really love you
Then a sinner I will be
If it's wrong to hug and kiss you
Oh, my soul will never be free

This should go on forever
It should never, ever end
If it's wrong to really love you
I'll forever live in sin

If it's sin to really love you
Then a sinner I will be
If it's wrong to hug and kiss you
Oh, my soul will never be free

This should go on forever
It should never, ever end
If it's wrong to really love you
I'll forever live in sin
