I don't know why they mad at me
They can't catch me but still they after me
When we deal face to face, is a tragedy
You ask why i got my gun they might blast at me
Real niggaz, real shit, reality
Who gives a f*ck if you niggaz is mad at me
F*ck around with Warren G its a tragedy
Real niggaz, real shit, reality

Warren G top dog
Patrollin the beach
Niggaz say they as hard as bitch
But they're as soft as a peach
Claimin the G of all G's
Please
I come blowin through like the breeze
Sittin on threes
Post it
Coastin mashing down Pacfic Coastin
The bomb chrome rims black on black Yukon
With nuts hangin' from the city
Where the bangers is being banging
it don't seem like shit is changing
I holla'd at the homey the other day
G'ded up at the park sippin alisah
One of the homeys took a beaten
So now we spend at being a gang
of checking at the meetin like cycles repeatin
It's just another sunset fall in sea
I can here the homeys in the past callin me
And you know what i discovered
What they keep saying
Keep your mind on your money
muthafuckers and shake busters

Chorus

Have you ever sold millions
But yet you niggaz persist to talk shit
Get of my dick
You never catch me slipping
Rollin with the heat
Slap the clip in
I never thought the world would started trippin
My life is a trip, though
Hit the crip though
Blow the whistle
They think i banged
So i packed a pistol
Warren to tha G is a G
I don't f*ck with you nigga
So don't f*ck with me
Let's ride to the east side
Slide like a fo
I packs a fo-fo
When i'm steppin out doors
To the bang to the buggy
If i speak then i spoke
Warren G do it every time to you Locc
Get the party beat like blaze and smoke
The east side and the beach
West side of the coast
You know the niggaz that i ride with
Hogs, attack dogs
the same niggaz i'm down to die with muthafucka

Chours

Who's the man
I've been from London to Japan
Stomp land to land
To the Egyptian sands
You can't check me
Dis-respect me
Or mop me up
With the base bumpin' out my truck
And all these police trying to lock me up
Money rules the world
And I made the loot
So don't make me shoot
'cause trying to mash
Will get you done every time
I ain't trying to hurt nobody
But i'm down for mine

Chorus
