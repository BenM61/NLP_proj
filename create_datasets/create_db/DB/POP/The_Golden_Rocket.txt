Board!
From old Montana down to Alabam' 
I've been before and I'll travel again
You trifling women can't keep a good man down
You've dealt the cards but you missed the play
So hit the road and be on your way
Gonna board the Golden Rocket and leave this town

I was a good engine a-runnin on time
But baby I'm switchin' to another line
So honey, never hang your single out for me
I'm tired of running on the same old track
Bought a one way ticket and I won't be back
This Golden Rocket is gonna roll my blues away

Hear that lonesome whistle blow
That's your cue and by now you know
That I've got another true love waitin' in Tennessee
This midnight special is burning the rails
So woman don't try to follow my trail
This Golden Rocket is gonna roll my blues away

Hear her thunder on through the night
This Golden Rocket is a-doin' me right
That sunny old southland sure is a part of me
Now from your call-board erase my name
Your fire done went out you done lost your flame
And this Golden Rocket is a-rollin' my blues away

That old conductor he seemed to know 
You've done me wrong I was feeling low 
For he yelled aloud we're over that Dixon Line
The Brakeman started singin' a song 
Said 'You're worried now, but it won't be long'
'This Golden Rocket is leavin' your blues behind'

Then the Porter yelled with his southern drawl, 
'Let's rise and shine.  Good mornin' you all'
And I sprang to my feet to greet the newborn day
When I kissed my baby in the station door
That whistle blew like it never before
On the Golden Rocket that rolled my blues away
