In twenty years from now
I want to be nowhere
I live life day by day
Just sitting in the same chair

If it wasn't for you
I'd have taken root
You gave me a brand new meaning
An extra season
And all of this
From a girl who's

Scared of the spiders
And she's scared of the dark
She's scared of the bogeymen in 
The park
But if anybody comes near me
I know she'll cut their balls off

They wrote a book about her
It's taken the place of the
Holy Bible
I'd send her to the stars
But the universe couldn't handle that ego

If it wasn't for you
I'd have taken root
You gave me a brand new meaning
An extra season
And all of this
From a girl who's

Scared of the spiders
And she's scared of the dark
She's scared of the bogeymen in 
The park
But if anybody comes near me
I know she'll cut their balls off

Scared of the spiders
And she's scared of the dark
She's scared of the bogeymen in 
The park
But if anybody comes near me
I know she'll cut their
If anybody comes near me
I know she'll cut their
If anybody comes near me
I know she'll cut their balls off
