Someone really loves you
Guess who
Guess who
Open your heart
Oh, then surely you'll see
Oh, that someone who really cares is me
Someone will wait eternally
Someone who'll want your love
Oh so desperately
Open your heart
Oh, the surely you'll see
Oh, that the someone who really cares
Who really cares is me
