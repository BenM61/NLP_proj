I saw you messin' around
We were down, the times were rough
But was the light that you found
On the other side enough?

What did I do so wrong?
You lied and led me on
Was I your hit and run?
Left for dead and now you're gone

Oh we were comin' around
You threw me back down
You had my trust in your hands
You gave it up again

We were comin' around
So far from dealin' with all these little games

Holdin' in so much you could drown
When you knew that times were tough
But I've had enough with you down
With your hands facing up

What did I do so wrong?
You lied and led me on
Was I your hit and run?
Left for dead and now you're gone

Oh we were comin' around
You threw me back down
You had my trust in your hands
You gave it up again

We were comin' around
So far from dealin' with all these little games

With all these little games

I feel you far, too far away
Would you need to, need to stay

I'm feeling far away (So far from seeing)
Why would you even stay? (You're so deceiving)
I'm feeling far away (So far from seeing)
Why would you even stay?

Oh we were comin' around
You threw me back down
You had my trust in your hands
You gave it up again

We were comin' around
So far from dealin' with all these little games

Oh we were comin' around
You threw me back down
You had my trust in your hands
You gave it up again

We were comin' around
So far from dealin' with all these little games

With all these little games
