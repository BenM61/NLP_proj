All I ask from anyone
Is that they ask nothing from me
Stared so long at the future
That I'm blind to reality
Come a time will watch our lives
Slip into the sea
All I ask from anyone
Is that they ask nothing from me

Dreams fly by like a thousand railroad trains
Egos steadfast like mountains in our brains
Those of us who let go will be swallowed
Left here to die

Do not look to the sky
It will not rain for you
Do not look to strangers
They won't help you through
Only chance you got
When you hear those war dogs bark
Is to be one up on your brother
Like a blind man in the dark

Face to face we will meet again
But never eye to eye
Meanwhile, in your mania
Your four wings touch the sky
Fly too high the wax will melt
And you'll fall down to your knees
All I ask from you my friend
Is that you ask nothing from me

Dreams fly by like a thousand railroad trains
Egos steadfast like mountains in our brains
Those of us who let go will be swallowed
Left here to die
Do not look to the sky
It will not rain for you
Do not look to strangers
They won't help you through
Only chance you got
When you hear those war dogs bark
Is to be one up on your brother
Like a blind man in the dark

Do not look to the sky
It will not rain for you
Do not look to strangers
They won't help you through
Only chance you got
When you hear those war dogs bark
Is to be one up on your brother
Like a blind man
Blind man in the dark
Blind man in the dark
