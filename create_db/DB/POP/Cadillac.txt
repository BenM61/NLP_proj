My baby drove up in a brand new Cadillac
My baby drove up in a brand new Cadillac
but she ain't never, ever coming back

Baby, baby, baby please
Can't you see I'm on my bended knees
Your heart's so cold it's gonna freeze

My baby drove up in a brand new, brand new Cadillac
My baby drove up in a brand new Cadillac
but she ain't never, ever coming back

Yea, Cadillac
Woah Cadillac
Yea Cadillac
Ooh Cadillac
Yea Cadilac
Ooh CADILLAC
