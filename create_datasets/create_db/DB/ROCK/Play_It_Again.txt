And on the other side of town
There fell a silence of a past and a distant sound.
And in a city underground
There came a hush, do we know what's going down?
Can we ever hear the same
Haunting songs that makes us play it again. 

And again, we'll play it again,
Play it again, play it again.
Play it again, play it again.
I want to hear that song again. 

Whatever happened to the band
Who strike the chords for a theme that has no end?
And if we had the chance, but then
What will we play?
Will we play it again?
And again, and again, and again - play it again. 

Play it again, play it again,
We want to hear that song again.
Play it again, play it again,
We want to hear that song again! 

And again, oh, play it again,
We want to hear that song again.
Play it again, play it again,
We want to hear that song again! 

Whatever happened to the band
Who strikes the chords that makes us
Play it again and again and again. 

Play it again and again and again,
Play it again, play it again,
Play it again, play it again,
I want to hear that song again. 

And again, play it again
Play it again, play it again,
Play it again, play it again,
And again and again.
