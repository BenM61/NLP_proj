I guess it finally got to me
I guess it finally got to me

I was content to be alone 
If I was tempted, I'd be strong 
I had them hot and cold before 
What made you think you offer more 

And then you touched me 
Lifted me higher 
Set my soul on fire 
Turned me about and I couldn't get out 

I guess it finally got to me
I guess it finally got to me 

I was selfish in my heart 
I admit it from the start 
It wasn't gonna be easy like the rest 
Thought maybe I couldn't stand the test 
 
And then you touched me 
Lifted me higher 
Set my soul on fire 
Turned me about and I couldn't get out 
And I had to shout I guess it finally got to me 
I guess it finally got to me 

I guess it finally got to me
I guess it finally got to me

And then you touched me 
Lifted me higher 
Set my soul on fire 
Turned me about and I couldn't get out 
And I had to shout I guess it finally got to me 
I guess it finally got to me
