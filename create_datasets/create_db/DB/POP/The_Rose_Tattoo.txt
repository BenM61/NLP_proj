He wore the rose tattoo,
To prove his love was true . . .
But hearts can lie, so why deny,
That roses fade and love can die . . .

She'll wait her whole life through,
Like fools an' dreamer's do . . .
She'll go on caring for one who's wearing,
The rose . . . the rose tattoo . . .

She'll wait her whole life through,
Like fools an' dreamer's do . . .
She'll go on caring for one who's wearing,
The rose . . . the rose tattoo . . .
