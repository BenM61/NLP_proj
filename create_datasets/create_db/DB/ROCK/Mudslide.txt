There's a mudslide, 
Slippin' down to cover the hillside
And you can bet it's gunna seep into your house
In through your eyes 
And out your dirty little mouth

There's a mudslide
A monoeyed browntied bonified mudslide
And what s the odds that you're enjoying one right now?
From the comfort of your favourite easy couch

And the man said:
How'm I gunna get my liscence clean
How'm I gunna get my
How'm I gunna get my
How'm I gunna get my liscence clean
How'm I gunna get my
How'm I gunna get my

The scum's gunna keep on risin'
It swallows up the sun shining new horizon
And everywhere you look
It's the same disguises
The lunatics it seems,  from the whole asylum
