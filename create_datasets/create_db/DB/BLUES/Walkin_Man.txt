You say jump, I say how high
Exactly you want me to jump to
And you say walk, I will walk
To the end of the line and back to you

My name is Steve and I'm your walking man
Yes, I am

You say boy, do you really love me?
Well, I ain't got much words to say
Let me write my answer
Down in the sand by the waves

My name is Steve and I'm your riding man
Yes, I am
My name is Steve and I'm your walking man
Yes, I am

If you want me to stay
I'll stash my sleeping roll under your bed
That says more than anything
In my life I ever said

My name is Steve and I'm your staying man
Yes, I am
My name is Steve and I'm your riding man
Yes, I am
My name is Steve and I'm your walking man
Yes, I am
