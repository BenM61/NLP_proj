Silent night! holy night!
All is calm, all is bright,
Round yon virgin mother and child,
Holy infant so tender and mild,
Sleep in heavenly peace [Repeat: x2]

Silent night! holy night!

Shepherds quake at the sight,
Glories stream from heaven afar,
Heavenly hosts sing alleluia!
Christ the savior is born [Repeat: x2]

Silent night! holy night!

Son of god, love's pure light;
Radiant beams from thy holy face,
With the dawn of redeeming grace,
Jesus, lord at thy birth [Repeat: x3]
