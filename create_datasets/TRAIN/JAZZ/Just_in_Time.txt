Just in time
I found you just in time
Before you came my time
Was running low

I was lost
The losing dice were tossed
My bridges all were crossed
Nowhere to go

Now you're here
And now I know just where I'm going
No more doubt or fear
I've found my way

For love came just in time
You found me just in time
And changed my lonely life
That lovely day

Now you're here
And now I know just where I'm going
No more doubt or fear
'Cause I've found my way

For love came just in time
You found me just in time
And changed my
Lonely life that lovely
Lonely life that lovely
