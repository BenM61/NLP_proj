What a heart of fool I am
My dreams fade away

Oh
I know you are my friend
Feel it stronger every day.
Do you want to - sentimental lady - do you want to - be my baby?
Do you want to break my heart over and over again?

In the backseat of your Cadillac
Oh baby
Ooh
You made me mad
So mad.
In the backseat of my Cadillac

I want to have my feelings back.
Oh
Kiss me with devotion
All I want is you

Oh
Kiss you and hold you and touch you
Baby.

What does it take my heart to win back your love?
I'll never tear apart
My baby
I'll never get enough.
Do you want to - sentimental lady - do you want to - be my baby?
Do you want to try my heart over and over again?

In the backseat of my Cadillac
...

Try me
My love
Fly with me
I'm lost in love - give me your
Emotions -.
Try me
My love
My love and my heart and my soul.

In the backseat of my Cadillac
...
In the backseat
In the backseat of my Cadillac
...
