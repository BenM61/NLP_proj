I've landed with a bang
And in my letter home to you
I'll tell of fast cars and fast living
But nobody knows you
And that's why I've no one to talk to
Soon as I've made enough money
I'll send a ticket to get you here
What better location, for our great new career

As soon as you get here
Big new beginning
All that it seems is just a matter of time
Big new, big new beginning

I try to figure the people out
They're even kissing in the street
Where there's skyscrapers and chain stores
And too many people
I better watch I don't get overpowered
So this is the way that it is
Don't jump on anyone else's train
We've got familiar problems
But I've no one to share them with

As soon as you get here
Big new beginning
All that it seems is just a matter of time
Big new beginning
