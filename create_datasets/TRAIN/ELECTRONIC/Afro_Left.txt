Taken by surprise by the size of my brain
Knowing all the time all the lies all the games
Thinking up a storm when it storms it's going to rain
Taking what's mine all the time, all the time
Take some for yourself
It's all good for something
And when there's no more to give
The window will shine in the light
On what's left for me
Knowin' your mind, knowin' your mind
That you've got to remember
You've got to remember, your name
Knowin' your mind, knowin' your mind
That you've got to remember
That you've got to remember, your name
Staggering around, can't find a place to sit down
Nothing suits my ass
Toast to some champagne of pain
I know you can bring us all a bottle
Remember the time when time was a friend
And you could make him lend you a hand
Now there's a place where taking takes place
And time just gets in your way
Take some for yourself
It's all good for something
And when there's no more to give
The window will shine in the light
On what's left for me
Knowin' your mind, knowin' your mind
That you've got to remember
That you've got to remember, your name
Knowin' your mind, knowin' your mind
That you've got to remember
You've got to remember, your name
Knowin' your mind, knowin' your mind
That you've got to remember
You've got to remember, your name
Knowin' your mind, knowin' your mind
That you've got to remember
You've got to remember, your name
Yeah, take some for yourself
It's all good for something
And when there's no more to give
The window will shine in the light
Take some for yourself
It's all good for something
And when there's no more to give
The window will shine in the light
On what's left for me
What's left for me
