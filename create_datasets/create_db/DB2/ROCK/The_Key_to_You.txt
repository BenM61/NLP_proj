Good things will come your way
You'll find a brighter day

All that I can be
All I want to do
Is be the one inside the world
When he finds the key to you

All the promises
Never quite came true
Found the way to live again
When I found the key to you
When I found the key to you

Good things will come your way
You'll find a brighter day

All that I can be
All I want to do
Is be the one inside the world
When he finds the key to you

All the promises
Never quite came true
Found the way to live again
When I found the key to you
When I found the key to you

Good things will come your way
You'll find a brighter day

All that I can be
All I want to do
Is be the one inside the world
When he finds the key to you

All the promises
Never quite came true
Found the way to live again
When I found the key to you
When I found the key to you

When I found the key to you
Be with someone
When I found the key to you
