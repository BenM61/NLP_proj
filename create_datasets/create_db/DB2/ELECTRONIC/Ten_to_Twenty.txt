Different ways of counting
Fingers running through your hair
Ten to twenty lifelines
If you doubt how this compares
There's fear enough to share
A fear of loathing
So easy how you bear
The trace of me without you there

So fall like the snow 
Too much too slow
Too fragile to say 
Hanging over every day
A breeze with contempt
To shame the others
A story's too thin
To cover all your lovers

Count me out your standards
Shadow trade in competence
Ten to twenty answers
Shouting down on confidence
Too easy not to share
To vain for secrets
There's fear enough in 
There a taste of need in someone's care

So fall like the snow 
Too much too slow
Too fragile to say 
Hanging over every day
A breeze with contempt
To shame the others
A story's too thin
To cover all your lovers

So fall like the snow 
Too much too slow
Too fragile to say 
Hanging over every day
A breeze with contempt
To shame the others
A story's too thin
To cover all your lovers
