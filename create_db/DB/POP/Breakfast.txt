I woke up between dawn and night
Thought I heard the voice of mammie
Hmm hmm

Sound's as if my parents have a fight
So I woke up my brother lying next to me
Hmm hmm

Wonder why she's making all that noise
Better go and check it out
Hmm hmm

So without trying to breath
Only the sound of little feat
We where about to discover what that noise was all about
And as we opened up the door
We saw them lying on the kitchen floor
We where grateful for they both did their best
But we said 
"Hey, there must be an easier way to make breakfast"
Hmm hmm
Breakfast

They both got up real fast
As if they where caught or something
Hmmm hmmm

And then we understood at last
It was a surprise-breakfast they where planning
Mamma told as later kids we'll understand
While daddy was busy putting on his pants
We said "we already do, don't worry we'll do the rest
So far for our quest me made coffee, boiled eggs
We made them breakfast
Hmm hmm
Breakfast
