Oh he, He doesn't deserve you
If you let me into your big white house
I'll stay there for you
Oh he has his arms around you
When I passed you and you stared at your feet
I was smiling for you
But you wouldn't notice me
If I stated I was to go away
Away
But you wouldn't notice me
If I stated I was to go away
Away
Oh no
I've really changed my mind
I'm going to buy the pound signs in your eyes
And I
I've really changed my mind
I can look at you now I know what you like
But you wouldn't notice me
If I stayed up I was to go away
Away
But you wouldn't notice me
If I stayed up I was to go away
Away
