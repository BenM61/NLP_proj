Boom boom boom boom
Gonna shoot you right down
Take you in my arms
I'm in love with you
Love that is true
Boom boom boom boom
I like the way you walk
I like the way you talk
When you walk that walk
and you talk that talk
You knock me out
Right off of my feet
C'mon and shake,
Shake it baby 
Shake it up baby
Shake it baby
C'mon now baby
Shake it baby
I don't mean maybe
Shake it baby
You're driving me crazy
Shake it baby
C'mon, c'mon
Shake it baby
All right, all right
The way you walk
The way you talk
When you walkin' that walk
And talkin' that talk
You knock me out
Right off of my feet
I need you right now
I mean right now 
I don't mean tomorrow
I mean right now
C'mon, c'mon
C'mon shake it up baby
Boom boom boom boom
