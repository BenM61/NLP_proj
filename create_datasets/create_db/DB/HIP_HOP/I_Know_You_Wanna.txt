Y'all y'all y'all
What you came to do, What you came to do
Would you bounce baby

[Verse 1]
Have you ever had a main nigga make you hotter
And hit the hot spot the way that i'll do
I'll give it to you just the way you like it 
Say yeah, yeah, yeah
Anytime anyplace, you can have it your way
All you gotta do is just call me
Oh baby, like the way you freak your body
