How does it feel, to be the one
A heart of stone, a smile of steel
You're talking nice, know how to charm
You see the goods, but not the price
I wonder
You turn your back on poverty
You got your high society
Call up your friends, you know them all
You're still immune to rise and fall
Remember
You're such a great pretender
Anytime, anywhere
I'll be watching you, all the things that you do
Anytime, anywhere
I'll be around, I'll be waiting for the moment you fail
No shaking hands, get in the ring
Those empty words don't mean a thing
The time will come, it won't be late
We're slipping through the hands of fate
But remember
You're such a great pretender
Anytime, anywhere
I'll be watching you, all the things that you do
Anytime, anywhere
I'll be around, I'll be waiting for the moment you fail
Anytime, anywhere
Oh, I'll be watching you, all the things that you do
Anytime, anywhere
I'll be around, I'll be waiting for the moment you fail
I'll be waiting for the moment you fail
Yeah yeah yeah
Anytime, anywhere
