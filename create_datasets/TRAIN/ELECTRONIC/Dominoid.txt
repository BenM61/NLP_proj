I can't control this urge so I risk what I wager,
I lost to a chicken shit never was panty sniffer,
Got my eye on a cool hand 
And I wonder about his dog of a day,
Wanted to be a big shot real hot 
Down with the domino,
You know calling on instict calling the bluff,
Telling a tale ten stories high to the operative,
I figured the numbers underpressure 
I played by the seat of my pants,
Then fate took a twist quietly wile faking it 
Waiting for a fluke,
Waiting for a sign by now boggle eyed,
If I believe I will receive 
Leaning on the ever lasting tree,
Hanging in the hands of fate down with the domino,
I'm no, down with the domino,
 I'm no casino casanova with the good luck eyes,
It's hard to tell who's friend or foe 
When you go down like the domino,
One track mind just digging 'till I find,
The gold at the end of the rainbow just keep on going,
Though twisted up inside her fool heart 
Takes over and jumps on for the ride,
Down with the domino, 
I need the roulette to make me forget,
Rotating random eyes roll in tandem,
Lady look illusive but I do what I can 
Better be a day as a lion,
Than a life time as a lamb 
Down with the domino, down, you know.
