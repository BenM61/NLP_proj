I hear your steps when you walk
And I love the way you talk
Just Can't forget
Your smile
Baby I like your style
Come and stay for the night
Everything will be alright
My devotion never stops
Take I to the top

I've been crying in the rain
Deep down feel my pain
Are you longing for much
Girl, I'm burning for your touch
All I need is just a smile
I can't wait a while
You love it, I love it
I take it to the limit

Give me passion
Free me heal me
Hear my body talk
So take me to the limit
Take me to the point
Take me to the limit
Take me to the limit
Take me to the point
Take me to the limit
Take me to the limit
Take me to the limit

No love likes yours
In the whole wide world
It's precious like a pearl
It turns me up and down
And in and out
Makes me feeling strong and proud
So take ma to the limit

When I'm turning off the light
My body starts to shiver
I've been searching for you
All around the world
And now you're mine, you're mine
