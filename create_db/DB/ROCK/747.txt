We got a 747 coming down in the night
There's no power, there's no runway lights
Radio operator try to get a message through
Tell the flight deck New York has no lights
There's no power, what do we do
A 747 coming down in the night
Try to get a message through

We were strangers in the night
Both on separate flights
Strangers in the night
Going nowhere
We were strangers in the night
Both on separate flights
Strangers in the night

Going nowhere
This is Scandinavian 101
Flight from Hawaii coming out of the sun
Kennedy, you should be in sight
We can't see a thing here in the night
Navigator says we're on the flight path
There's no radio, no sign of life
This is Sandinavian 101

For Gods sake get the ground lights on
'Cause we were strangers in the night
Both on separate flights
Strangers in the night
Going nowhere
We were strangers in the night
Both on separate flights

Strangers in the night
Going nowhere
There's a 747 goin' into the night
There's no power they don't know why
They've no fuel they gotta land soon
They can't land by the light of the moon
They're overshooting there's no guiding lights
Set a course into the night

Scandanavian 101
For Gods sake get your ground lights on
We were strangers in the night
Lost on separate flights
Strangers in the night
Going nowhere
We were strangers in the night
Lost on separate flights

Strangers in the night
Going nowhere
Strangers in the night
We were strangers in the night
Strangers in the night
We were strangers in the night
Strangers in the night

Both on separate flights
Strangers in the night
Going nowhere
We were strangers in the night
Flight 101
Strangers in the night going nowhere
