Now I'm confiding, know I'm in haze
Going through the motions my whole life
I hope this is the first day
That I connect motion to feelings
Being slowly, we spend slowly ;til morning

You know, you know, you know you know
Appearance is nothing
You know, you know, you know you know
Appearance is nothing
And I am my lover
Know that I fell electrowaves
Ashamed lover
When you me touch I wonder what you want from me

It feels like like a thousand pound weight holding your body down 
In the pool of water barely reaching your chin

I will assume form
I'll leave the ether
I will assume form
I'll be out of my head this time
I will be touchable by her
I will be reachable
I couldn't tell you where my head goes either

But it wanders, to the high up
Where I'm not all here, and there's no karma
When you touch me, I wonder
I always wonder what you could want with me

I will assume form
I'll leave the ether
I will just fall and be the leaver
I will be touchable
I will be reachable
'Cause I can already see that this goes deeper

Now you can feel everything
Doesn't it seem unnatural?
Doesn't it seem flawed?
Doesn't it feel connective?
Doesn't it seem crying?
Don't you know your best side shows when you're unaware
Not thinking, just primal
Now you can feel everything
Doesn't it get much clearer?
Doesn't it seem connecting?
Doesn't it get you started?
Doesn't it make you happier?
Doesn't it feel more natural?
Doesn't it see you float?
Doesn't it seem much warmer?
Just know in the sun we'll be out
