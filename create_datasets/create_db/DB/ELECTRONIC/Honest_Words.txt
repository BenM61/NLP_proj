Crossed out a lyric, discerned
I rewrote the start, with a stab at the end
I blotted out all that I've wrote
Rubbed away distance, I smooth out the false
And those are honest words
It's the first time
Otherwise I'm told I'm waiting to choke them way down in my throat
Those are honest words

Blindfolded holding the tail
You pushed in your pin and yet you're destined to fail for you've
Suffered three rounds of the fight, a cut to the eye brow, a hook to the right
A jab to the temple
You're back on the roads, smooth out the false
Not for a lyric amend
A stab at the start, contrite at the end

And those are honest words
It's the first time
Otherwise I'm told, waiting to choke them way down in my throat
Those are honest words
It's the first time
Otherwise I'm told waiting to choke them way down in my throat
Those are honest words
It's the first time
Otherwise I'm told waiting to choke them way down in my throat
Those are honest words
