Where you got nowhere to go
And your pockets
They ain't got nothing left to show

When times are bad for you
And you need someone else to help you

Look over your shoulder
I'll be standing right there

Where, when people pass you by
And they look at you
Out of the corner of their eye

When you feel very small
Like you're not there at all

Look over your shoulder
I'll be standing behind you

Yea, when life is down on you
And everything you do turns out wrong
If my love is strong
I'll be there right behind you

Where, when people put you down
And your pride is not, it's not quite down to the ground
When your whole world falls through
And you need someone to help you

Look over your shoulder
I'll be standing behind you
Yeah, look over your shoulder
I'll be standing there
