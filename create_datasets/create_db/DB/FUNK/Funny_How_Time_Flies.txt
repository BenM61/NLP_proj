Funny how time flies when you're having fun... Oh baby
Funny how time flies when you're having fun... Oh baby

I don't know where it all went... Time passed us by
Just when it seemed the fun began... ooh...F

Funny how time flies when you're having fun
Funny how time flies when you're having fun

But time never ends... Let's find the time
To get together once again... someday soon

Funny how time flies when you're having fun
Funny how time flies when you're having fun

Don't you ever leave
(Funny how time flies when you're having fun)
Don't you ever go
Say you love me so
(Funny how time flies when you're having fun)
Funny how time flies when you're having fun... When you're having fun
Funny how time flies when you're having fun

I really don't know where all the time went
I really have to go
Stop, stop!
Oh I really have to go
Oh I really have to go
One more time? Oh...
