She must belong to San Francisco 
She must have lost her way (Posted up poster of poncho and Cisco) 
One California day 
She said she believes in Robin Hood and brotherhood 
And colors of green and gray 
And all you can do is laugh at her 
Doesn't anybody know how to pray 

Arizona take off your rainbow shades 
Arizona have another look at the world, my my
Arizona cut off your Indian braids 
Arizona hey won'tcha go my way 

Strip off your pride your acting like a teeny-bopper run away (child) 
Scrape off the paint off the face of a 
Little (town)saint 
Arizona take off your hobo shoes 
Arizona hey won'tcha go my way 

Follow me up to San Francisco (I would be guide your way) 
I'll be the Count of Monte Cristo 
You'll be the Countess May 
You can believe in Robin Hood and brotherhood and (Rolling the ball in the hay) 
(I would be reading you an Aesop's fable) 
Anything to make you stay 
Arizona take off your rainbow shades 
Arizona have another look at the world, my my my 
Arizona cut off your Indian braids 
Arizona (Hey won'tcha) go my way 
Arizona take off your hobo shoes 
Arizona have another look at the world, my my my
