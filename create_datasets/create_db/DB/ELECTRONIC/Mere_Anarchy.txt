Caution of the world you said was over
Caution where we were
Caution where we were
Oh

Caution of the world you said was over
Caution where we were
Caution where we were
Oh

Caution cities
Raised by no one
Caution waits, but never find hope
Caution lifts, we did this wrong
Caution has the way and I don't feel this anymore

Caution of the world you said was over
Caution where we were
Caution where we were
Oh

For a long time we stayed down
And all we said was sleep alone
Watch the city fall
Those eyes so low
Watch the sunlight
Watch it go
Watch the storm rise
Watch the storm fall
Watch the storm rise
I watch the storm fall

Caution of the world you said was over
Caution where we were
Caution where we were
Oh

Caution of the world you said was over
Caution where we were
Caution where we were
Oh
