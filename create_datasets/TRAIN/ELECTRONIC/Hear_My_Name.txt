You've been through it all
Nothing has to change
Take it all - the pain in me
But what if that's all there is?

A-a-a-all the way and we would
A-a-a-all the way and we would
Are you all there is in my heart
It does believe that you are - just my age

Here my mind is empty
Oh nobody comes away
Here time is ending
Here I'm gonna stay

Hear my name
Doesn't anybody want to play
Hear my name
Can anybody find a way

Say my name now baby
Loud and clear
Say my name now baby
Say it so I can hear your voice

All I want to do is get next to you
All I want to do is get next to you
All I want to do is get next to you

Here my mind is empty
Oh nobody comes away
Here time is ending
Here I'm gonna stay

Hear my name
Doesn't anybody want to play
Hear my name
Can anybody find a way

Here my mind is empty
Oh nobody comes away
Here time is ending
Here I'm gonna stay

Hear my name
Doesn't anybody want to play
Hear my name
Can anybody find a way
