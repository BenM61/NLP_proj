Hey,
Who's that playing?
Hey,
The guitar?
Is it Jim? I don't know
Is it Jim? I don't know
In the spaceship, the silver spaceship, the lion takes control,
In the spaceship, the silver spaceship, the lion takes control,
Hey,
Who's that playing?
Hey,
The guitar?
Hush my darling, be still my darling, the lion's on the phone,
Hush my darling, be still my darling, the lion's on the phone,

Hush my darling, be still my darling,
Hey,
Hush my darling, be still my darling
Hey

Turn it up
The guitar
I can't hear, the guitar

In the spaceship, the silver spaceship, the lion waves goodbye
In the spaceship, the silver spaceship, the lion waves goodbye

Hey,
Who's that playing?
Hey,
The guitar?
Hey,
Hey,
Hey,
Hey,
