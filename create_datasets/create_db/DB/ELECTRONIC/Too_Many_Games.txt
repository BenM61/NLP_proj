Lover's they sometimes get
On each others nerves
They can really really be so mean
Playing around with words
Wanna know why do we do it
Why we choose to break each others hearts
Why when it keeps us far apart

Ain't it funny the things we do
For the sake of pride
It don't matter who might get hurt
As long as your satisfied
We ought to be right to each other
Ooh you know the things I'm speakin' of
Why do we mess around with love

To many games that people play
To many games that people play
Far to many games that people play
To many games that people play

To many people they get hung up
On those he say she say games
We don't care who might get hurt
And you know that's just insane
We've got to stop look listen
At the way we treat each other so unkind
Why when it's just a waste of time

To many games that people play
To many games that people play
Far to many games that people play
To many games that people play

You know what I'm talkin' bout
There can really be no doubt
I hope that you and I can work it out

Stop these silly games that people play
To many games that people play
To many games that people play
