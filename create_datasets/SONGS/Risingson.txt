I seen you go down to a cold mirror
It was never clearer in my error
You click a shine upon your forehead or
Check it by the signs in the corridor
You light my ways through the club maze
We would struggle through the dub daze

I sink myself in hair upon my lover
It's how you go down to men's room sink
Sad we talk how madmen think
I sink myself in hair upon my lover
I don't know her from another miss
I don't know you from another
See me run now you're gone, dream on

Why you want to take me to this party and breathe
I'm dying to leave
Every time we grind you know we sever lines
Where have those flowers gone
Long time passing
Why you keep it testing, keep on tasking
I keep on asking

Toy-like people make me boy-like
Toy-like people make me boy-like
They're invisible, when the trip it flips
They get physical, way below my lips
And everything you got hoi-poloi like
Now you're lost and you're lethal
Now's a fine time, you gotta leave all
These good people, dream on

Nicer than the bird up in the tree top
Cheaper than the chip inside my lap top
All the variations you could do with me
Nicer than the girl up in your mind you're free
Automatic crystal remote control, we come to move your soul
You kinda fade into the background
Like a better smoke'll bring you back round
Like a man slide inside you my dear
Your cheap beer's filled with crocodile tears
See 'em run now your gone, dream on

I found a reason
Toy-like people make me boy-like
Toy-like people make me boy-like
Dream on
