I know a movie star
I've got her plastered to my wall.
Just like we're dear old friends
Like she already knows me.
She's as perfect as she seems,
Lifts me right out the mezzanine.
I finally fell in love,
I'd been waiting forever.

Four, three, two, one
When out the barrel of a gun
Keep my head way down.
Stay out I'll stay in.
Half dead, half numb
She's enough to make me warm
It's all so safe and sound.

Lie back and fast asleep
If you could see what I could see.
Drip drop a lovely dream.

Goddamn you movie star,
Can't you just stay a minute more.
We'd be the best of friends
You could stay here forever.

Four, three, two, one
When out the barrel of a gun
Keep my head way down.
Stay out I'll stay in.
Half dead, half numb
She's enough to make me warm
It's all so safe and sound.

She will be sweet on me
Just like a mystery.
It's not so hard to see
If I'm not mistaken.
She comes from far away
Gets closer everyday.
And all that I can say
She's all I want and all that I live for.

Four, three, two, one
When out the barrel of a gun
Keep my head way down.
Stay out I'll stay in.
Half dead, half numb
She's enough to make me warm
It's all so safe and sound.
