Let me light the fire
Build your weapons
These nations overrun with you
Out of action
To this end, we'll resist forever
Ready to kill all thrashy gods
With this machine, cry-out, fire!
The kids speed along when
The last night comes down
I hear you win
You break the sound barrier
To race down the streets
We hear you sharpen the weapons
Tonight the killer will come
With his smashin' sound
Tomorrow behind you
Death will raise by your noise
The steel will be sold
Under the hammer
We will stir heaven and earth
You'll bump one's head on the stage
And your music will be all the rage
Suddenly a storm will
Sweep this town
The invaders and their
Weapons will be back
Move your ass build your kits
And face death again
At work to exist
Don't need restrictions
Raise the forceful fist
Forge ahead with fun
As long as I live
I will cross our weapons
To heat up the steel
It's time for an ovation.
