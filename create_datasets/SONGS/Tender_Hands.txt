Oh how, at the journey's end, I lie in the heat of the night,
Feeling the heartache, wondering why,
I want a friend, I want a friend to lay down beside me,
I want a friend, I want her now, someone who knows what I mean,
When I say, that I need

Tender hands to hold me, I need tender hands tonight,
Will you lay them on my shoulders,
Will you lay them on my eyes,
And I need tender hands to take me,
All the way to paradise, and then, when it's over,
I need tender hands to hold me through the night;

Touch me with your velvet mouth, I will give all the love that I have,
Under the moonlight, reaching your heart,
Where are you now, where are you now, come out of the shadows,
Where are you now, I want you now,
You know that I cannot always be strong, and I need

Tender hands to hold me, I need tender hands tonight,
Will you lay them on my shoulders,
Will you lay them on my eyes, and I need,
Tender hands to take me all the way to paradise,
And then, when it's over, I need tender hands,
To hold me through the night;

I am only a voice in a city of noise, can you hear me this time,
I see the storm grow, there's a light in the desert tonight;

And I need tender hands, give me tender hands,
Will you lay them on my shoulders, oh give me,
Tender hands to take me all the way to paradise,
And then, when it's over, I have tender hands,
To hold you through the night, darling,
My tender hands will hold you through the night;

I want your tender hands, you have tender hands,
I want those tender hands, tender hands
