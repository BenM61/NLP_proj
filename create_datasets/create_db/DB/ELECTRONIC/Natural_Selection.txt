One day I'll find the perfect one for me
They will be pretty and funny at least to me
Crooked teeth and everything
I want to meet my perfect lady
I think I saw her at the picture with her only
I think I saw her at the picture with him
I move towards her
She thinks of him

And the holidays we spend with our friends
Across the country we find ourselves again
Another galaxy removed from ourselves
I think we met in a station in some city
Maybe I'll find the right one for me

One day I'll find the right one for me
She will be pretty and funny at least to me
Pigeon feet and everything
I want to meet my perfect lady
I think I saw her at the diner with her only
I think I saw her at the drive in with him
I stare at her and she's lovin' him

Maybe I'll find the right one for me
Maybe I'll find
Maybe I'll find
Maybe I'll find the right one for me

Maybe I'll find the right one for me
Maybe I'll find the right one for me
