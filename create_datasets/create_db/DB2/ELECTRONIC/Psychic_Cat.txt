Put on your hat
Psychic cat
Tell us the news
As we cruise

Where do you go?
When we blow
You look so fine
Who do you know?

Ooh la la la
Lost on 3rd street promenade
Lost on 3rd street promenade

Even flow
From head to toe
Where's it at?
Psychic cat

Sky's so blue
So don't be sad
'Cause we love you
Psychic cat

Ooh la la la
Lost on 3rd street promenade
Lost on 3rd street promenade

Ooh la la la

Lost on 3rd street promenade
