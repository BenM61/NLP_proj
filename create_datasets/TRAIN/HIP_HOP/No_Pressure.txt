So here I am
And I'm ready to
Talk all through the
Night if you want to
We'll do whatever you want to do
See, I'll make you understand
I won't be the man to let you down
Coz baby I'll be around, yeah 

And girl I know that
You've been hurt before
Let me reassure you
There's only good intentions
If you'll relax and let
Your feelings flow
Soon you'll know 

Girl there ain't no pressure
We'll do it the way you like to
Just remember
I will always be here for you
Girl whenever
Rain or sunny weather
Just remember
That there ain't no pressure on you 

And there you are
Right in front of me
My soul sister and my queen
Ain't nobody else compares
The way you look
And the things you say
Amazes me in each and every way
And I'm reminded every day 

'Cause girl I know that
You've been hurt before
You can't take no more
Of all the false pretenses
So let me take this
Chance to ease your mind
We can take our time 

Girl there ain't no pressure
We'll do it the way you like to
Just remember
I will always be here for you
Girl whenever
Rain or sunny weather
Just remember
That there ain't no pressure on you 

Pressure...
Like to...
Remember...
I will always be here for you
Girl whenever
Rain or sunny weather
Just remember
That there ain't no pressure on you 

And girl I know that
You've been hurt before

Girl there ain't no pressure
We'll do it the way you like to
Just remember
I will always be here for you
Girl whenever
Rain or sunny weather
Just remember
That there ain't no pressure on you 

Girl there ain't no pressure
We'll do it the way you like to
Just remember
I will always be here for you
Girl whenever
Rain or sunny weather
Just remember
That there ain't no pressure on you
