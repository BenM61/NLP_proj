Every drop of water
Descending like a pearl
Lays upon the silken skin
Of this perfect girl

The breeze around her body
Moved upwards to her face
It held on like a baby
That found its resting place

Voices from the night before
Cannot be denied
Suddenly revealing
All the pain inside
Entering a well of thoughts
All her fears subside
All the bad things turning to
A blessing in disguise

She was the faintest flower
Washed in by the tide
Sending silent messages
To the world outside

Her face began to soften
Her lips took on a smile
The people who had loved her
Came rushing to her side

Voices from the night before
Cannot be disguised
Suddenly revealing
All the pain inside
Entering a well of thoughts
All her fears subside
All the bad things turning to
A blessing in disguise
