I'm stepping on troubled times
There's something that's on my mind
If you knew what I knew then you'd want to go
I'm looking for a way out

I really don't know how, please won't you tell me now
Why I'm losing myself again
I seem to go nowhere, please won't you tell me yeah
Why I'm losing myself again

Keep walking to my own beat
It's hard to be out of the scene
Don't you know all these people
They stick to themselves
And no-one's allowed to evolve

I really don't know how, please won't you tell me now
Why I'm losing myself again
I seem to go nowhere, please won't you tell me yeah
Why I'm losing myself again

You knew what I had to lose
You knew what I had to lose
You knew what I had to lose
You knew what I had to lose
And I'm losing myself again

Keep losing my, keep losing my
Keep losing my, keep losing my
Keep losing my, keep losing my

You knew what I had to lose
You knew what I had to lose

I really don't know how please
Won't you tell me now
Why I'm losing myself again
I seem to go nowhere please
Won't you tell me yeah
Why I'm losing myself again

Why I'm losing myself again
Why I'm losing myself again
Why I'm losing myself again
Why I'm losing myself again
Why I'm losing myself again

You knew what I Had to lose
You knew what I had to lose
You knew what I had to lose
