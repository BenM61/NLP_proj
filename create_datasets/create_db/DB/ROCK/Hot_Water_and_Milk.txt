You're dumb but it's sweet
I'd hate you smarter than me
Can't you see?
That's what begins the confusion

You're just the perfect man
No feet, no head, no hands
Can't you see?
That's where we'll end the confusion

You've said it
I've said it
You've said it
But I meant it
You've said it
I've said it
You've said it
But I dread it again

We're from different worlds
You're boys and I'm from girls
Can't you see?
That's what begins the confusion

You think I love you
But I know that isn't true
Can't you see?
There isn't any confusion

You've said it
I've said it
You've said it
But I meant it
You've said it
I've said it
You've said it
But I dread it again
