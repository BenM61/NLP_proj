He bought her diamonds
He bought her pearls
He made her whisper that she's daddy's girl
She wants the money
It comes with his cream
So she closes her eyes and pretends it's a dream

Shake me up
Shake me up
Shake me up
Shake me up
Shake me up
Shake me up

Sweat stains the wrinkles
Tongue touches the hole
His wife's at work and his kids are at school
She feels so dirty
She knows that it's wrong
But she feels so good in Louis Vuitton

Shake me up
Shake me up
Shake me up
Shake me up
Shake me up
Shake me up
Shake me up

Shake me up
Pop my cork
Feel me drip
While you talk
Let me in
I want to stay
I'll wear you down girl
I'll buy a way
You got a gold hole sugar
You got a gold hole sugar
You got a gold hole sugar
You got a gold hole sugar
And it makes me feel like I am rich
And it makes me feel like I am rich
And it makes me feel like I am rich
It makes me scratch that tender itch

Shake me up
Shake me up
Shake me up
Shake me up
Shake me up
Shake me up
