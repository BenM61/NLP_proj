Screen doors slamming, a wood-haven laughing
We better take cover, careful, we're gonna get
Caught in the rain if you don't hurry I got a vision of somewhere
And I've seen places in this book I borrowed from my uncle
Stick around, stick around, all I hear is stick around

But everybody's wasted, I don't wanna waste in Jackson
Never gonna face it, no one wants a change in Jackson
But I'm wide awake now, breaking out, breaking out, sorry town

It's like being stuck in Disney Land, it's perfect, ain't it?
But there's not a single good ride
I'm tired of playing cowboys and Indians with you
Nothing comes from nothing and there's so much that I hear
Stick around, stick around, all I hear is stick around

But everybody's wasted, I don't wanna waste in Jackson
Never gonna face it, no one wants a change in Jackson
But I'm wide awake now, breaking out, breaking out, sorry town

Hell, I'll never take you with me
You just keep on chucking through me
There's no use in coming for me
Stick around, stick around, all I hear is stick around

But everybody's wasted and I don't wanna waste in Jackson
Never gonna face it, no one wants a change in Jackson
But I'm wide awake now, breaking out, breaking out, sorry town
Breaking out, breaking out, sorry town
I'm breaking out, I'm sorry town, I'm breaking, I'm breaking out
I'm, I'm sorry town

Breaking out, breaking out, sorry town
I'm breaking out, I'm sorry town, I'm breaking, I'm breaking out
I'm, I'm sorry town
