Tattoo Shop,
Hi, Doc
Hey Fish, what are you doin'?
If you don't mind we're gonna record this
Is that cool?

Oh, that's cooler 'n hell
Hell yeah, 52's biggest dream man
You know his biggest dream was
Me and him go party with you

On the trail of torn out twisters
Two angels on a mission came
Dust devils danced before them
In the path of the hurricane

On the road to Oklahoma
Through the flatlands from L.A.
From the shadows in the valley
From a country where the lizards play

While they drove they kept the radio on
Why don't you sing along, sing along, sing along?

I don't think so

A man stands behind his shadow
A man stands behind his words
These men are together with family
To defend their rights in another man's world

Most people stood against them
Most people disagreed
With the need for all those weapons
In our safe, secure society

Paint the words and the pictures on another man's skin
We are lovers, warriors, magician kings

Well, I don't think so, don't think so

Fuckin' brilliant, man
Okay, here's what happened

52 barred the door shut from the inside
A gunfight started on the front porch
52 shot back

You know they come into his home with it
So he's protecting himself
The guy inside the house blew his brains out

Yeah, they made it look like he killed himself
But no one believes he would
'Cause he's not that kind of man, that's all

I think, he wasn't afraid of death
You know, he believed in something to die for
That's what he did

Some say he had it coming
Others say he was sole to blame
But who says they've got the rights
If any at all to blow the brothers away

A man got a right to wonder
A man got a right to dream
Without looking over his shoulder
To choose the manner of the life he leads

One man's thoughts on another man's skin
We are lovers, warriors, magician kings

I don't think so

What they have done
Was they've come in and murdered him
For his bombs and his ammunition

Just like that Waco Texas
Or any of these other things
Over here in the United States

Anybody that's stockpiling firearms and ammunitions
Is a threat to the government
So the government wages war against us

They tortured him, he went out
But I'm sure he stood up
Like he was supposed to, you know?

They smashed all the rings
Shut on his fingers with a hammer
It was all an orchestrated plan, man

The more the closer I was getting to it to the truth
The more they got everybody looking at me
As being the guy that pulled the trigger

And what they did when they killed 52
Is they broke the whole family up
That's exactly what they wanted to do
They wanted to break all of us up
