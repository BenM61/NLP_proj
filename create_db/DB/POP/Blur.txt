Cool
Yeah, you good?
Yeah

Under the bad, bad moon tonight
Or baby, is it just me?
Or is it something in the air we breathe?
'Cause I'm feeling dizzy, dizzy, ah
How was the party? Was it treating you right?
I wish that I could be there but I'm
Under the bad, bad moon tonight
Baby, can you help me?

Let me out, I’m trapped in a blur
Started out the way I wanted but it’s weird now
Let me out, I’m lost in the words
Too much in my head, I shoulda seen the bad signs
I wanna tell you everything will be fine
But I’m afraid that it's a waste of your time
Let me out, I’m lost in the words
Don't know how I ended here
Trapped in a blur

Hey!
Oh
Oh
Hey!
Oh

How do you fit it all in your mind?
'Cause I can't seem to
Yeah, they keep dancing to it on and on
But they don't understand the song
Under the bad, bad moon tonight
I just need to come clean

Let me out, I’m trapped in a blur
Started out the way I wanted but it’s weird now
Let me out, I’m lost in the words
Too much in my head, I shoulda seen the bad signs
I wanna tell you everything will be fine
But I’m afraid that it's a waste of your time
Let me out, I’m lost in the words
Don't know how I ended here
Trapped in a blur

Hey!
Woo!
Hey!
Trapped in a blur
Hey!
Trapped in a blur
Oh
Oh
Hey!
Oh
Woah

Let me out, I’m trapped in a blur
Started out the way I wanted but, it’s weird now
Let me out, I’m lost in the words
Don't know how I ended here
Trapped in a blur
