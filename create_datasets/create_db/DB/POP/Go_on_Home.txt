When the kisses get so long that you can't catch your breath
And the huggin' gets so strong that it's gotcha scared to death
Most people get married (married)
That's what they do-o-o
Most people get married (married)
And that's what I want to do with you

When you only want to walk (let's walk) together
Only want to talk (let's talk) together
Only want to touch (let's touch) too much
You never want to say "Good night"

Most people get married (married)
That's what they do-o-o
I-I-I want to get married (married)
An' I only want to do it to you

When you light up like a flame each time your baby calls
And the way he says your name has gotcha climbin' walls
Most people get married (married)
That's what they do-o-o
Most people get married (married)
And that's what I want to do with you

When you're feelin' in your heart (doo-wop), what I feel
Reelin' in your heart (doo-wop) like I reel
An' you want to shout (you shout) "Look out,
Somethin's gotta give tonight"

Most people get married (married)
That's what they do-o-o
I-I-I want to get married (married)
An' I only want to do it to you

I-I-I want to get married
An' I hope you want to do it, too
