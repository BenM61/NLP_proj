Tonight I feel so weak
But all in love is fair
I turn the other cheek
And I feel the slap and the sting of the foul night air
And I know you're only human
And I haven't got talking room
But tonight while I'm making excuses
Some other woman is making love to you

Somebody bring me some water
Can't you see I'm burning alive
Can't you see my baby's got another lover
I don't know how I'm gonna survive
Somebody bring me some water
Can't you see it's out of control
Baby's got my heart and my baby's got my mind
But tonight the sweet devil, the sweet devil's got my soul

Will this aching pass
Will this night be through
Wanna hear the breaking glass
I only feel the steel of the red hot truth
And I'd do anything to get it out of my mind
I need some insanity that temporary kind
Tell me how will I ever be the same
When I know that that woman is whispering your name

Somebody bring me some water
Can't you see I'm burning alive
Can't you see my baby's got another lover
And I don't know how I'm gonna survive
Somebody bring me some water
Can't you see it's out of control
Baby's got my heart and my baby's got my mind
But tonight the the sweet devil, the sweet devil's got my soul

Oh-huh,oh yeah
Got my soul
Uh-huh, ooh yeah

Somebody bring me some water
Can't you see I'm burning alive
Can't you see my baby's got another lover
And I don't know how I'm gonna survive
Somebody bring me some water
Can't you see it's out of control
Baby's got my heart and my baby's got my mind
But tonight the sweet devil, the sweet devil's got my soul
Oh yeah, oh, oh 
Baby's got my heart, my baby's got my mind
Tonight the sweet devil, the sweet devil's got my soul
