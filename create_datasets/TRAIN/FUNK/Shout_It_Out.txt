Shout it out, if your partner is your best friend
Shout it out, shake your buddy's hand
Shout it out, if you really love the DJ
Shout it out, everybody take a stand.

You gotta shout shout shout shout, shout it out
You gotta shout shout shout shout, shout it out
You gotta shout shout shout shout, shout it out
You gotta shout shout shout shout, shout it out

Shout it out, if there's beauty in the beat
Shout it out, if the rhythm is a treat
Shout it out, if romance is in your heart
Shout it out, everybody start.

You gotta shout shout shout shout, shout it out
You gotta shout shout shout shout, shout it out
You gotta shout shout shout shout, shout it out
You gotta shout shout shout shout, shout it out

Shout it out, if your partner is your best friend
Shout it out, shake your buddy's hand
Shout it out, if you really love the DJ
Shout it out, everybody take a stand.

You gotta shout shout shout shout, shout it out
You gotta shout shout shout shout, shout it out
You gotta shout shout shout shout, shout it out
You gotta shout shout shout shout, shout it out
