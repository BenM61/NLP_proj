Songs when the truth, 
Are all dedicated to you, 
In this invisible world I choose to live in, 
And if u believe that, 
That now I understand, 
Why words mean so much to you, 
They'll never be about you. 
Maybe your young without youth, 
Or maybe your old without knowing anything's true, 
I think your young without youth. 

Then you contract the American dream, 
You'll never look up once, 
You've contracted American dreams, 
I'd acquire you to stop and look up. 

Sing a song about myself, 
Keep singing a song about myself, 
Not some invisible world. 

Constantly searching to find something new, 
But what will you find when you think that nothings true, 
Maybe it's that nothing is new, 
So you let me hear songs that were written all about you, 
The good songs weren't written for you, 
They'll never be about you. 

Then you contract the American dream, 
You'll never look up once, 
You've contracted American dreams, 
You'll never look up once, 
Don't look up. 

Sing a song about myself, 
Keep singing a song about myself, 
Not some invisible world.

Sing a song about myself, 
Keep singing a song about myself, 
Not some invisible world.

And I won't tell you what this means, 
'Cos you already know, 
And I won't tell you what this means, 
'Cos you already know. 

So, sing a song about myself, 
Keep singing a song about myself, 
Not some invisible world. 

So, sing a song about myself, 
Keep singing a song about myself, 
Not some invisible world. 

So, sing a song about myself, 
Keep singing a song about myself, 
Not some invisible world. 

You'll find what you find, 
When you find there's nothing.

You'll find what you find, 
When you find there's nothing.
