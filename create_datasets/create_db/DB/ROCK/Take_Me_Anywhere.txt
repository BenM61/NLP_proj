Scenes move by days dragging on
I'm only killing time
Boundaries, fences and endless instructions
That is nothing to what is mine
You remember you were there
Do you know
Do you care
Is it just a memory
I can't stop what I can't see
Take me anywhere
Take me anywhere

Takes too long to see a change
It's different than before
So take me in or leave me cold, I'm not waiting any longer
And I got a hit though it's something like more than you get that I want it to
That I can't delinquish my heart has escaped to what it has begun

But I can't stop what I can't see
Take me anywhere
And I can't stay where I can't sleep
Take me anywhere
Oh take me anywhere
Take me anywhere
I can't stop
