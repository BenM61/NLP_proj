They held up as long as they could 
All those people at my feet 
Yeah 
I was so smug in my prime 
Up at the height of my conceit 

Oh, I thought I would never fall 
Oh, I got to tell you all 

I got my back up against the wall 
You know this ain't the first time 
I got my back up against the wall 

It's been a long fight 
I didn't know I'd have to make no 
And I'm so afraid 
It's gonna be more than I can take now baby 
You know what I mean 

I thought I'd never fall 
Oh, I got to you all 

I got my back up against the wall 
I ain't jokin' y'all 

I got my back against the wall 
Sometimes I find myself with my back against the wall 

I got my back against the wall 
Just like a lot of good people now 

They love me all around the world 
I can't understand you girl 

I wonder why the pure in heart 
Oh, they got to have a judgment day 
I wonder why 
And I wonder what the Lord has made 
Now that he plans to throw away 
I wonder, what did he really say 

I thought I would never fall 
Oh, I got to tell you all 

I got my back against the wall 
Sometimes you find yourself down on the street 
Yeah you do 

I got my back against the wall 
Sometimes no matter how hard you try 
You still take a fall, oh yeah 

I got my back against the wall 
Last night I started to cry 
And I cried all night long 
Yes I did 

I got my back against the wall 
Last night I started to pray 
And I prayed all night long 

And that's when I got that feeling y'all 
Down in my soul 
It's just a part of life 
It's just a part of your life
