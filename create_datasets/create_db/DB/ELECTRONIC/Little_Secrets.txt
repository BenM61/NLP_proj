When I came down the dawn poured into me
I shook em up, the walls came crumbling
My fists kept trembling with these salty wounds
My stolen gold inside the emperors tomb

Now painting rainbows on my ugly face
I built this cardboard neighborhoods disgrace
But I ascend and serve my feverish need
Within the confines of such chemistry

It's the way I see
Everything I need
It's no way to be

Let this be our little secret
No one needs to know were feeling
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher

But I feel alive and I feel it in me
Up and up I keep on climbing
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher

My face blew up at such a casual sight
The smattered colors of ecstatic fright
The rush above me to oblivion
Outlining wet sidewalks in halogen

Oh have you ever felt so goddamn strong
How come it takes some people so damn long
He tried to squeeze the lemon juice to rain
The citrus drawing out the scene in stains

Watch the basin drain
As your life lines wane
And you cant explain
As your friends complain

You've caused all this pain
And you proudly shame
Your whole families name

Let this be our little secret
No one needs to know were feeling
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher

But I feel alive and I feel it in me
Up and up I keep on climbing
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher

Mother I can tell what you've been thinking
Staring at the stars on your ceiling
Thinking once there was a power that you were wielding
And now I've hit the mark
Stabbing at the dark
And I cannot help but ignore the people staring at my scars

Let this be our little secret
No-one needs to know we're feeling
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher

But I feel alive and feel it in me
Up and up I keep on climbing
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher

Let this be our little secret
No one needs to know were feeling
Higher and higher and higher

But I feel alive and I feel it in me
Up and up and keep on climbing
Higher and higher and higher
