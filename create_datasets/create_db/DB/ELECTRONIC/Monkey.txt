Oh my my
Little white lie
I swear I'm gonna make it right this time

It's like a radio
Turning way down low
Telling me things I do not know I know

Tonight you will be mine
Tonight the monkey dies
Tonight you will be mine
Tonight the monkey dies

Now who's to blame
We used to be the same
Now you won't let me speak your name, what a shame

It's a suicide
Shut up and drive
We're never gonna make the light but it's alright

'cause tonight you will be mine
Tonight the monkey dies
Tonight you will be mine
Tonight the monkey dies

Tonight you will be mine
Tonight the monkey dies
Tonight you will be mine
Tonight the monkey dies

Oh, tonight you will be mine
Tonight the monkey dies
