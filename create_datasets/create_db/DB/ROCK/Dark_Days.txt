
It feels like abuse
So subtle the noose
So subtle the noose
 
There is no light
That's what they say
I'm checking out
Not checking in
Drawing lines
Growing out of favor
Out of favor
 
If it's meant to be
Then set it free
If it's meant to be
It'll come back you see
 
Watch what you say
And what I don't
Heard what you've asked
And no I won't
Drawing lines
Growing out of favor
Out of favor
 
If it's meant to be
Then set it free
If it's meant to be
It'll come back you see
 
Dark days, dark days, dark days
Dark days, dark days, dark days
 
Oh no! I feel it!
Oh no! I feel it!
 
Dark days, dark days, dark days
Dark days, dark days, dark days
 
If it's meant to be
Then set it free
If it's meant to be
It'll come back you see
