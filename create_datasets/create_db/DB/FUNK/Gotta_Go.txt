Good evening
I'd like to thank everybody for coming out
Hope your flights were safe
Feeling real breezey
Swift like the wind

It's calling my body
It's calling my soul
It's calling my mind
So girl I gotta go
Baby it's the grind
Yes I had a good time
(Don't get me wrong) You were so good
And I really wish I could
Stay a little bit longer
Love you a little bit stronger
And go a little deeper
Baby with you
But since this thang is calling I
Gotta answer dry your eyes
Girl don't cry
'Cause your making it hard for me

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't want to leave (Oh girl)
But I gotta go right now
I'll be back to hold you down (I don't wanna)
I don't want to leave no
But girl I gotta go right now
But I'll be back before you know it

So hold that thought (that thought)
Don't you move
See I'm coming right back
Right back for you
Don't you change your position
Girl I'm on a mission
Baby trust I'll be missin'
Missin' you
'Cause I don't wanna leave

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Streets be calling me
They be callling my name
And when they call I gotta go
So I'm letting you know
I wont be gone for long
And already I can't wait to come home to you

[Chorus]

I don't want to leave
But I gotta go right now
I'll be back to hold you down
I don't want to leave
But I gotta go right now
But I'll be back before you know it

Break it down now ow
Nah I don't want to leave
But you know how it is when
Whoa baby keep that on
Don't take it off
Keep in on
So I can take it off when I come back
Yeah for sure

[Chorus]
