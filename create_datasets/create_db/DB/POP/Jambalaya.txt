Goodbye, Joe, me gotta go, me oh my oh
Me gotta go, pole the pirogue down the bayou
My Yvonne, the sweetest one, me oh my oh
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou

Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and filgumbo 
'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio 
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gayo
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou

Thibodaux, Fontaineaux, the place is buzzin'
kinfolk come to see Yvonne by the dozen
Dress in style and go hog wild, me oh my oh
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou

Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and filXumbo 
'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gayo
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou

Settle down far from town, get me a pirogue 
and I'll catch all the fish in the bayou
Swap my mon to buy Yvonne what she need-o
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou 

Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and filXumbo 
'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio 
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gayo
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou
