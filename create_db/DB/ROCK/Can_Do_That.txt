Well take a look at me now here
Another sucker ruining the atmosphere
Gotta be the story of my life
From the very embryo start
It's been piles and piles and piles of goo goo
How about you, how about you
No one take notice of a little thing
Start to grow into a big thing
Bigger than anything
Well, you can join the commando's
Be just like a little Rambo
You can challenge the world
And you'll never know that a wind will blow
And it's gonna be cold
But you'll always keep on singin'
Like you've been told
You can do that, you can do that
Yeah! You can do that
With the power of your soul, just go ahead
Gotta get back on top again
Well, meanwhile - broke - busted
Hungry and not trusted
Thanks for lousy deals - tell me all about it
No, stop! I want to keep my ears clean
I got goose bumps in the wrong places
Screaming - looks like the vultures are gathering
Well no matter how thin that string, I want to hold on to that thing
They say when the goin' gets tough the tough get goin'
But can you prove it baby?
The fairytale - wisdom - oxygen - give me a breath of your precious oxygen
Precious, precious oxygen...
