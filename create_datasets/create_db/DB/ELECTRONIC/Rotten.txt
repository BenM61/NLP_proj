Just because you've gotten
Yourself into a hole
There's no need to go ahead tossing it
Because you lost control
I wouldn't do any better
You should surely know
Given the choice to risk it all
As we're breaking at the bones
As we're breaking at the bones

I will forgive your rotten
Needs before I go
Your trails of debt and soaking wet cotton
It's a pain that you'll never know

I will forgive your rotten
Needs before I go
Your trails of debt and soaking wet cotton
It's a pain that you'll never know

We don't have to be modern
The honesty you've shown
The shame we've spread
The truth, it's coming
By circumstance alone
There's no need to soften
I'll keep your lovely note
And let go of all these decisions
Remember what you know
You will never be alone

I will forgive your rotten
Needs before I go
Your trails of debt and soaking wet cotton
It's a pain that you'll never know

I will forgive your rotten
Needs before I go
Your trails of debt and soaking wet cotton
It's a pain that you'll never know

Pain that you'll never know
It's a pain that you'll never know

And I'll love you through all the pain
I can love you through your heartache
You tend to be gentle no need to explain

I will forgive your rotten
Needs before I go
Your trails of debt and soaking wet cotton
It's a pain that you'll never know
