See now I'm not the picky type, 
But I'm gonna go out and get what's mine 
Got to quest my appetite, 
So much choice yeah so little time. 

Some may think that I'm easy, 
Unlike some guys are hard to please 
Wanna set my record straight, 
'Cause its not about escaping. 

I'm not feeling lonely, 
I'm just biding my time 
I'm searching for my beauty, 
What I'm sure will be just mine 
Don't fuss about her, 
Just looking for a good time 
If you wanna come see me, 
Don't hesitate girl. 

I keep it universal, 
Just want to get my front on 
No need for no rehearsal, 
I wanna see the final show. 
Just keep it universal, 
I play the game to win (oh) 
No need for no rehearsal, 
Seen everything I need to know. 
'Cause I'm keeping this universal. 

Sometimes feel you got me wrong, 
Won't come get your conversation on 
Feel I'm quite approachable, 
Don't let my propriate get out no 
In time ill settle down, 
Then my queen can share my crown 
But for now just gonna go out, 
'Cause I don't know what I'm missing. 

I'm not feeling lonely,

Gonna search for my beauty, 
What to call just mine. 
No I don't fuss about her, 
I'm just taking my time 
If you want to come see me, 
Won't you hurry up. 
(Oh yeah)
