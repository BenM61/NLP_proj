In the dark  in the dark of night 
I am wide  I am wide awake 
Thinking about all the things we said 
Anger  Hey  Hey 

How you looked when you slammed the door 
How I felt when you walked away 
And I give everything I have 
If you stay  you stay 

It hurts deeper than you know 
I can't go on like this 

Don't care who's wrong or right 
Don't care too much for pride 
The love between us is all that matters 

Won't you come back to me 
We'll work it out somehow 
Oh, can't you see that it's all that matters 

In the tears of so many years 
When I think of the time we spent 
And I can't seem to stop the tears 
From falling, falling 

If I could I would turn back time 
If I could I could at least stop pain 
There is only so much the heart could take 
From breaking, breaking 

It hurts more than you could know 
I can't go on like this 

Don't care who's wrong or right 
Don't care too much for pride 
The love between us is all that matters 

I miss the feeling of lying in your arms 
(Lying in your arms) 
I miss your reach every moment 
(That we're apart) 
(We're apart) 
(We're apart 
(Yeah, yeah) 

Don't care who's wrong or right 
Don't care too much for pride 
The love between us is all that matters 
repeat to fade
repeat to fade
