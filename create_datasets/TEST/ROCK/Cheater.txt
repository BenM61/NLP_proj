If these are the rules
And if these are the laws
Then I will play falsely
Cause they're filled with flaws

I won't play your game
Cause I think that it's lame
And if you feel just like a do
Oh! You can become-come a chea-chea-chea-cheater too

Cheater, cheater, cheater, cheater
Cheater, cheater, cheater, cheater
Cheater, cheater, cheater, cheater
If you feel just like I do
You can become a cheater too, yeah!

I'm a brick through your window
A stick in your machinery
A time bomb ready to blow
I'm Friday thirteen on your diary

I won't play your game
Cause I think that it's lame
And if you feel just like a do
You can become-come a chea-chea-chea-cheater too

Cheater, cheater, cheater, cheater
Cheater, cheater, cheater, cheater
Cheater, cheater, cheater, cheater
And if you feel just like I do
You can become a cheater too, all along you cheater sing

Oh yeah! - Oh yeah!
Oh yeah! - Oh yeah!
Oh yeah! - Oh yeah!
You can become a cheater too
Oh yeah! - Oh yeah!
Oh yeah! - Oh yeah!
Oh yeah! - Oh yeah!
You can become a cheater too
If you feel just like a do
Yeah! I promise that it's true
You can become a cheater too

Cheater, cheater, cheater, cheater
Cheater, cheater, cheater, cheater
Cheater, cheater, cheater, cheater
Cheater, cheater, cheater, cheater
Cheater, cheater, cheater, cheater
Cheater, cheater, cheater, cheater
Cheater, cheater, cheater, cheater
Cheater, cheater, cheater, cheater
Cheater, cheater, cheater, cheater
Cheater, cheater, cheater, cheater
Cheater, cheater, cheater, cheater
