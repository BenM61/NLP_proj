The outside world is cold as ice
deep inside you're burning
you're raging as you live your life
this can't be all this is a lie
so take my hand
this pain must end
into the sky if you believe we'll fly

come on let's leave this world behind

a prescious gift you once forgot
is awakening this moment
if you believe it becomes real
this energy they could not kill

it gets so strong
we'll melt to one
just spread your wings
let loose and fly with me

come on let's leave this world behind

this misery must fade away
for us to see a better day
if that's all there is to choose
let it loose right now
