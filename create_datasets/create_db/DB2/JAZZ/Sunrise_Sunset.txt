Sunrise, sunset

Is this the little girl I carried
Is this the little boy at play?
I don't remember growing older
When did they?

When did she get to be a beauty
When did he grow to be so tall?
Wasn't it yesterday
When they were small?

Sunrise, sunset, sunrise, sunset
Swiftly flow the days
Seedlings turn overnight to sunflowers
Blossoming even as we gaze

Sunrise, sunset, sunrise, sunset
Swiftly fly the years
One season following another
Laden with happiness and tears

One season following another
Laden with happiness and tears
