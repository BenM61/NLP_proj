This is the rhythm of summer nights
Two bodies dancing 
Until the morning light
Our favorite DJ 
He's playing our favorite songs
Summer nights
Summer nights

Night after night I have waited for someone
I looked up and you were there
But I can't remember this feeling I'm feeling 
I know that you've answered my prayer
For once in my life 
I found someone to love 
And who really cares
For once in your life when you know
You found true love and you just can't pretend
All of my life I've been waiting

This is the rhythm of summer nights
Two bodies dancing 
Until the morning light
Our favorite DJ

This is the rhythm of my life
You feel the music 
The magic of the night
Two bodies dancing 
To our favorite songs
Summer nights

Day after day
I've been searching and searching
For someone to love me for me
See I never knew
Of this passion inside me
'Til you came and set my heart free
Now I wanna share my life, 
My soul, my dreams with you every night
'Cause I wanna let you know 
I'm a stronger man with you by my side
All of my life I've been waiting

This is the rhythm of summer nights
Two bodies dancing 
Until the morning light
