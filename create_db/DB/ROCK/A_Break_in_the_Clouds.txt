I just want to remember you
The way you're standing there
With that hurry home looks in your eyes
And flowers on the table

Sometimes I see too much
Sometimes I see too little
Sometimes shadows fall, darken all
And cover up the fable

Every time that I see your face
It's like cool, cool water running down my back
Cool, cool water running down my back

Sometimes I see my memories
Like a film that never stops
Although I know how it ends
Still I can't help but watch

There's a break in the clouds
As I feel myself shiver
Still there's no light coming through
No reflection on the river

Every time that I see your face
It's like cool, cool water running down my back
Cool, cool water running down my back

Every time that I see your face
It's like cool, cool water running down my back
Cool, cool water running down my back
