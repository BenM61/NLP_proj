Let it out. We can go top down
Just fade out, into the sun now
Paradise, swimming in moonshine
Living that good life. Baby, it's our time

I'm t-t-trying to lock your love down
Just give me one shot, I won't waste it now

Friday night, we were faded
On your lips, I could taste it
If I could just keep you here, one more weekend
Saturday, I was all in
With you 'til six in the morning
If I could just keep you here, one more weekend

One more weekend
If I could just
One more weekend

You and me, riding this daydream
It's so easy the way that it should be
Come alive, keep me up all night
Oh, now all I want is to hit reset
'Cause I'm not ready to come down yet

I'm t-t-trying to lock your love down
Just give me one shot, I won't waste it now

Friday night, we were faded
On your lips, I could taste it
If I could just keep you here, one more weekend
Saturday, I was all in
With you 'til six in the morning
If I could just keep you here, one more weekend

One more weekend
One more weekend

If I could just, ooh
Fell so deep, it went so fast though
Still thinking about when time froze
I won't waste it now
Moon sank just outside your window
You come back, I'll never let go
I won't waste it now

Friday night, we were faded
On your lips, I could taste it
If I could just keep you here, one more weekend
Saturday, I was all in
With you 'til six in the morning
If I could just keep you here, one more weekend

One more weekend
If I could just
One more weekend
