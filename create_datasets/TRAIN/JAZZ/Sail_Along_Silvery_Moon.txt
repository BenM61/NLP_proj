Sail along, silvery moon
Trail along lovers' lane
Sail along, silvery moon
To my love again

In the glow of your light
Let me see her tonight
Once again, hold her tight
Back in lovers' lane

And then the whole world will seem brighter
As we stroll hand in hand
Two blue hearts will seem lighter
If you understand.

Sail along, silvery moon,
Trail along lovers' lane
Sail along, silvery moon
To my love again.

Sail along, silvery moon,
Trail along lovers' lane
Sail along, silvery moon
To my love again.
