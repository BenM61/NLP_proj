In this life there is no question of why
Bloodied but unbowed
All persevere without doubt
But without your love I can't suffer the stars in the sky
I don't know why you haven't tried
Heed this advice

Love like you've never been burnt
Work like you don't need the money
Dance like there's nobody watching
Kiss like your tongue is on fire
Suck like you don't need the money
Sin like there's nobody judging

You can keep your cool
It's the occupation of fools

You kiss those rosy cheeks
The shine comes away on your lips
But with your love I could burn all the bridges in Venice
Yes I confess it
Yours is the love that I want to be in
And these are the words that I'm saying it in

Love like you've never been burnt
Work like you don't need the money
Dance like there's nobody watching
Kiss like your tongue is on fire
Suck like you don't need the money
Sin like there's nobody judging

'Cause honey if you tried
I'd come running to you child
Like Lassie's final mile
These problems are not mine

Yours is the love that I want to be in 
And these are the words that I'm saying it in
Love like you've never been burnt
