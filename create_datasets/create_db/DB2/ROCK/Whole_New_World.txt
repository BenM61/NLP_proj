Eight O'Clock on Tuesday Morning I Got it Yesterday
She said she would send a letter I haven't ate for days
I Should have guessed that it was over She always stayed away
My last hope was in the letters to see what she had to say

I had to pull myself together
I had to be so strong
So I waited for the postman
And it wasn't long
Before I opened up the letter and had to read about number one

There's a whole New World out there
And I want you to know that
The chains of Love are lifted from today
I miss you as I say
There's a whole new world out there

I had to get in touch with her to see what I could do
My heart missed a beat when she confirmed that it was true
A sudden lonely desperate feeling loomed around my head
She told me of her new friend and how they planned to wed
She had been with him before
When is the baby born so I

Cried for a moment
And then it got through
That if it's happened to me
It could just as easily happen to you

There's a whole New World out there
And I want you to know that
The chains of Love are lifted from today
I miss you as I say
There's a whole new world out there
