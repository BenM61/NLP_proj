Put your dreams away for now
I won't see you for some time
I am lost in my mind
I get lost in my mind

Momma once told me
You're already home where you feel love
I am lost in my mind
I get lost in my mind

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Oh my brother
Your wisdom is all that I need
Oh my brother
Don't you worry 'bout me

Don't you worry
Don't you worry, don't worry about me

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

How's that bricklayin' coming
How's your engine running
Is that bridge getting built
Are your hands getting filled

Won't you tell me my brother
'Cause there are stars up above
We can start moving forward

Oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

How's that bricklayin' coming
How's your engine running
Is that bridge getting built
Are your hands getting filled

Won't you tell me my brother
'Cause there are stars up above
We can start moving forward

Lost in my mind
Lost in my mind
Oh I get lost in my mind
Lost, I get lost, I get lost in my mind
Lost in my mind
Yes I get lost in my mind
Lost, I get lost, I get lost

Oh I get lost
Oh I get
