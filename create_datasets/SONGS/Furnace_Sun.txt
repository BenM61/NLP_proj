You said I don't care where you equalize your thoughts
And I don't mind where you go as time goes awry
Every time
I don't care where you go and what you do
And I don't mind 
Hey don't know if I'll even be alive in ten years' time

where are you now
Trying to beat the furnace sun
It's a simple taste a simple race
And time is all we've got
Got to play this town
You've got to play this town again

time is all we've got here
Time is fading heavy
Leaves are turning golden blue
And I'm not that ready
