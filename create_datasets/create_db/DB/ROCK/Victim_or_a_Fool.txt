Two words, you're gone
You don't say nothing else and that's what's so wrong
Am I a victim or a fool

Two hearts, keeps so close
One said forever baby, one just almost
Am I a victim or a fool

If it was something I did
Why did you keep it all hid
How could you rate me as the last in your line

How could you stop on a dime
You must have known all the time
The trouble waiting at the end of your ride

Two words, so strong
All of a sudden baby you say so long
Am I your victim or a fool

If it was something I said
You kept it all in your head
You kept your feelings hidden safely from view

And now you're not coming home
And I must face time alone
You're gone it's so wrong but all coming true

Two words, hit me so strong
All of a sudden baby you say so long
Am I your victim or a fool
Am I your victim or a fool
