Life, oh life, oh life, oh life, 
Doo, doot doot dooo. 
Life, oh life, oh life, oh life, 
Doo, doot dooo 

I'm afraid of the dark, 
'specially when I'm in a park 
And there's no-one else around, 

Ooh, I get the shivers 
I don't want to see a ghost, 
It's a sight that I fear most 
I'd rather have a piece of toast 
And watch the evening news 

Life, oh life, oh life, oh life, 
Doo, doot doot dooo. 
Life, oh life, oh life, oh life, 
Doo, doot dooo 

I'm a superstitious girl, 
I'm the worst in the world 
Never walk under ladders, 
I keep a rabbit's tail 

I'll take you up on a dare, 
Anytime, anywhere 
Name the place, I'll be there, 
Bungee jumping, I don't care! 

Life, oh life, oh life, oh life, 
Doo, doot doot dooo. 
Life, oh life, oh life, oh life, 
Doo, doot dooo 

Life, doo, doot dooo 
Doo, doot dooo 

So after all is said and done 
I know I'm not the only one 
Life indeed can be fun, if you really want to 

Sometimes living out your dreams, 
Ain't as easy as it seems 
You want to fly around the world, 
In a beautiful balloon 

Life, oh life, oh life, oh life, 
Doo, doot doot dooo. 
Life, oh life, oh life, oh life, 
Doo, doot dooo
