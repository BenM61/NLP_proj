Silence, we're standing barefoot
My head is turned towards the sky
The rain has washed away the tears
That I have cried

I hide beneath the stormy clouds
Your lips will blow them all away
The summer teardrops on my mouth
Touching my face

[Chorus]
I can feel my skin on your fingertips
I can feel your mouth pressing on my lips
I can feel your pulse high up in my back
I can feel your heart underneath my chest
I can feel the whirl, I can feel the air
I can feel your breath rushing through my hair
I can feel your passion
I can feel your pain
I can feel you fall

Your love is like a rainbow
Like a rainbow I have flown into
My dreams have come in color
When I'm with you

And you have seen my secret
You have seen my secrets and my life
But I can feel no shame now
With you inside

[Chorus]

And we have shared our secrets
We have shared our secrets and our lives
And we can feel no pain now
We live to die

[Chorus]
