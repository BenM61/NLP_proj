Sugar baby, be my savior,
'Cause I'm tired, I'm tired I've been eight days on the road
That's right, yes it is, eight days on the road,
Travelin' through the night,
There ain't no town, there ain't no town, there ain't no rest tonight yeah

I'm down and busted, standin' on the county line,
And that's why yeah, that's why I've been eight days on the road, yeah
That's right yes it is, eight days on the road
Travelin' through the night,
There ain't no town, there ain't no town, there ain't no rest tonight

I'm here thinkin', thinkin', I'm thinkin' 'bout what I've done,
And that's why, yeah, I've been eight days on the road
That's right, oh oh eight days on the road
Travelin' through the night,
Another mile gone, it won't be long, I'll make Birmingham tonight, yes I will, yes I will

I'm makin' it back to you baby,
I'm makin' it back to you baby,
I'm makin' it back to you baby,
I'm makin' it back to you baby,
Oh eight days, eight days on the road, woo
Yeah that's right, yes it is, a million days on the road
Yeah awh I've been steppin', I've been eight days on the road
Ah I've been eight days on the road
