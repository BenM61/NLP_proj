Flying high in the friendly sky
Without leaving the ground
Rest of the folks are tired and weary
And have laid their bodies down
I go to the place where danger waits
And its bound to forsake me

So stupid minded
But I go crazy, when I cant find it

In the morning I'll be alright my friends
Soon the night will bring the pains again

Flying high in the friendly sky
Without ever leaving the ground
Ain't seen nothing but trouble baby paraphernalia is my name
There's a place where the feeling awaits me
Self-destructions in my hands

So stupid minded
But I go crazy, when I can find it

I know I'm hooked my friends
To the boy
Who makes slaves out of men

Ahhh yeah

I did the best I could
Nobody understood

I did the best I could
Nobody understood (take way, take me away)
I did the best I could
Nobody understood
