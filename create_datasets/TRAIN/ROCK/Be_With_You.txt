All I want is you 
I want to hold your hand 
Please let me be your friend 
Just got to be with you 

We don't need to dance 
Don't need no outside friends 
Just we two
I got to be with you 

It's a moonlit night 
We're gonna be alright 
Nobody else in view 
Just want to be with you 

Ah, want to be with you 
Ah, want to be with you 

Take you up on love 
You're gonna want to stay 
Never comin' down 
Just want to be with you 

Want to see you smile 
I'm gonna make you feel good 
That's when you'll say 
I just want to be with you 

Ah, want to be with you 
Ah, want to be with you

All I want is you 
I want to hold your hand 
Please let me be your friend 
Just got to be with you 

It's a moonlit night 
We're gonna be alright 
Nobody else in view 
Just want to be with you 

Ah, want to be with you 
Ah, want to be with you 

Ah, want to be with you 
Ah, want to be with you
