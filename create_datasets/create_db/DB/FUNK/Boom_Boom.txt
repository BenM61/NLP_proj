Boom boom boom boom,
(I'm) Gonna shoot you right down.
Right off of your feet.
Take you home with me,
Put you in my house.
Boom boom boom boom.

A-haw haw haw haw
Mmm-hmmm-hmmm-hmmm
Mmm-hmmm-hmmm-hmmm
I love to see you strut
Up and down the floor
When you talking to me
That baby talk
I like it like that.
Whoa Yeah!

Talk that talk
Walk that walk

When she walk that walk
And talk that talk
And whisper in my ear
"Tell me you got your lovin'"
I love that talk,
When you talk like that.
You knock me out,
Right off o' my feet.
Whoa ho ho ho

Well talk that talk
And walk that walk

Whoa yeah!!
