I Should Thank God That It's True
He Sent an Angel Like You
But From The First Day 
I Had No Clue How To Handel 
Oh My

Angel I Clipped Your Wings
Only Gravity Keeps You Here With Me
Oh Angel I'm Sorry Right Now
But My Love Is No Tape So I Can't Rewind

There's Never A Forever Thing 
But Your Tears on My Shirt
Seem Not to Dry Oh My

Angel I Clipped Your Wings
Only Gravity Keeps You Here With Me
Oh Angel I'm Sorry Right Now
But My Love Is No Tape So I Can't Rewind

Well That's The Swing Of Things
I'm Sitting Here Just Telling Lies
To This Photo Of You And Me
Love Was not Known At Our Address
We've Gone Too Far Too Soon
You Were Just Unable To Deliver

Angel, Angel Let You Memories Fade Away Oh My

Angel I Clipped Your Wings
Only Gravity Keeps You Here With Me
Oh Angel I'm Sorry Right Now
But My Love Is No Tape So I Can't Rewind

Oh Baby Maybe We Were Too Young
Oh Baby Maybe You Are The One
Oh Baby You Would Better Become Undone
That's The Story About A Love That Failed
