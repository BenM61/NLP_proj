A long time ago
We used to be friends
But I haven't thought of you lately at all
If ever again
A greeting I send to you
Short and sweet to the soul I intend

Ah ah ah ah

Come on now, honey
Bring it on, bring it on yeah
Just remember me when
You're good to go

Come on now, sugar
Bring it on, bring it on yeah
Just remember me when

It's something I said
Or someone I know
Or you called me up
Maybe I wasn't home
Now everybody needs some time
And everybody knows
The rest of it's fine
And everybody knows, yeah

Come on now, sugar
Bring it on, bring it on yeah
Remember me when
