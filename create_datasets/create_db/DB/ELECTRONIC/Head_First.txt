I'm waiting longing for you
One more night and then I'm gone
It seems so crazy how
That we just only met but I know
I am your visitor
I'm on the other side of your world

My whole world in light
My whole world in light
My whole world in light
Head first in love

Thunder, lightning and rain
Imagine you're lying here again
Trying to get me out of here
Trying to get me back to you
You were always on the land
I was always in the air

My whole world in light
My whole world in light
My whole world in light
Head first in love

It seems so crazy how
That we just only met but I know
I am your visitor
I'm on the other side of your world

My whole world in light
My whole world in light
My whole world in light
Head first in love
