Hey mama, what's that there?
And what's that doing there?
Hey mama, up here! 
Mama, hey look at that over there!
And what's that doing there?
And where're they going there?
And mummy can I have that big elephant over there?

Who's that in my chair?
And what's he doing there?
Mummy, up here!
Mummy, can I go over there?
Hey mummy, what is square?
And where do we get air?
And mummy can I have that big elephant over there?

Quit talking!
There's no more anything here!
Forever to manage to know who and why and where!
Quit that, child!
Sometimes the questions get filed!
And mummy can I have that big elehpant over there?

Don't want to comb my hair
And where's my teddy bear?
Mummy, up here!
Look at the cowboy coming there!
And can I have a pair
Of boots like that to wear?
And mummy can I have that big elephant over there?

Time will march
Days will go
And little baby's going to grow
I gotta tell her what she needs to know
I'll help her along
And she'll be strong
And she'll know right from wrong

As life's parade goes marching by
She's gonna need to know some reasons why
I don't have all the answers
But I'll try the best as I can
I'll make him a man, that's right

'Cause you give the kid your best
And hope she passes the test
And I find it so hard I taught him well ***
Somewhere though she's going I betting I never will forget ***
Mummy, can I have that big elephant over there?

Hey why they do that there?
And how you put that there?
Hey mummy, up here! Hey mummy, what that say up there?
Hey mummy, what is fair?
How come I have to share?
And mummy can I have that big elephant over there? (3x)
