I thought so long and suddenly I realized
I love love
I thought so long and suddenly I realized
I love love

Am I loving the girl
Or the feeling I feel?
Is it just the idea that I like
Or is it for real?

I recall a special friend, I invited her home for tea
And while my mother cooked a meal she was under the table with me

I thought so long and suddenly I realized
I love love
I thought so long and suddenly I realized
I love love

These ideas that I have
Remain fixed in my head
Only the characters change
Someone else there instead

One day we went down to the park to feed the ducks some bread
Foul fowls wouldn't touch a scrap so we jumped in the duckpond instead

I thought so long and suddenly I realized
I love love
I thought so long and suddenly I realized
I love love
