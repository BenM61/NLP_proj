Straight outta high school he didn't know what to do 
Wanted to go to college but no money was nothin' new 
Wanted to get away go see the world and do somethin' new 
He got approached in the mall by the army recruit 
Told him "If you wanna go to school we got money too 
Sign up at eighteen you be you when you twenty-two" 
He joined the army airborne got his uniform went to boot camp got some 
Discipline Iraq is where they shipped him 
He's in the mission where bullets flyin' and missin' him 
Wishin' he was a kid again with his family in Michigan 
In the midst of fightin' militiamen, one round took down six of them 
He ain't really a killa though, takin' a lotta risks 
This is what a poor person do for a scholarship 
He turned around and got a face full of hollow-tips 
But don't be mad, he died for the flag 

[Chorus:] 
Now what you've done here, is put yourself between a bullet and a target 
And it won't be long before, you're pullin' yourself away 
What you've done here, is put yourself between a bullet and a target 
And it won't be long before, you're pullin' yourself away 

Papa was a playa, knew just what to say ta' 
Get the women back to his lair, and lay her 
If sex had a trophy he's the Hiesman touchdown 
Hittin' models and be	-chicks in Buzztown 
He got the women with crazy stares with his lady there 
Thay ain't care they like "Ooh look at his baby hair" 
He took 'em all put 'em in a line hit five new chickens 
He though they was fine 
Got head from five dope fiends smokin' a dime 
And did it all raw dog, and dog I ain't lyin' 
Til' he woke up one season with legions 
He went to the doctor asked him what was the reason 
The test read positive he couldn't believe it 
He tried to blame God askin' why did he leave him 
Pleadin' please let the disease leave him 
From women that he conquered, he caught the monster 

[Chorus:] 

Now when the sun goes down, north side of town 
On the other side of the block, when cops ain't around 
On the same side of the street that 'Pac hit the ground 
Not in Vegas, cause every nigga got 'Pac in him now 
When my guys hit the block, and we provin' we thugs 
I ain't on no swim team but you see pools of blood 
Skip Judy when you die, she ain't whose the judge 
If you married to game then prove your love 
Here's a strap shorty, shoot it do it then do it 
This ain't a game this a organized movement 
My hurt, my love, my pain, my stress 
My strife, my wife, my life, my test 
We made for more, we die for less 
When you starvin' in the ghetto I'ma right the rest 
See my girl think I'm hard, and my Momma think I'm hard 
But when I'm all up in the dark I just fall on my knees 

[Chorus:]
