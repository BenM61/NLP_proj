Oh, Danny boy
The pipes, the pipes are calling, yeah
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling, oh
It's you, it's you, you must go and I must bide

But come ye back when summer is in the meadow
And when the valley's, they're hushed and white with snow
Then, then I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so

But come to me, my darling, darling say you love me
If I am dead, I'm dead I will may be
You'll come and find, find the place where I am lying
And kneel, kneel and say, and say an ave, an ave there for
For me
