Dream away, child; let your dreams run wild
Or a lifetime of worries might claim you.
Dream away, child; let your dreams run wild
Or the years and the tears shed might claim you.

For the last time we have tasted 
Love's sweet tears by the fire's glow.
If our hearts are strong there'll be 
No long good-byes when it's time to go.
But the strongest torch is sometimes broken
As the deepest vows aren't always spoken,
And the greatest wounds, we hide inside ourselves 
Where they never show.

Dream away, child, let your dreams run wild.
Or a lifetime of worries might claim you.
Dream away, child; let your dreams run wild
Or the years and the tears shed might claim you.

When the Winter weds the Northern Wind 
The child they bear is snow.
And the branches bow like worried bridesmaids 
But the trees will grow.
Sun and Earth in time will come together,
God will give us back our summer weather,
But the mem'ries of that first sweet 
Taste of love pass away so slow.

Dream away, child; let your dreams run wild
Or a lifetime of worries might claim you.
Dream away, child; let your dreams run wild
Or the years and the tears shed might claim you.

When there's no room left to live inside ourselves 
Do we dream away.
