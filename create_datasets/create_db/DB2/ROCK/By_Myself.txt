By myself
Starting over again
By Myself
Looks like this time
I'm on my own
Starting over again

By myself
Time is on my side
By myself
Got no reason to hide
This time
I'm starting over again

For once in my life
I got a chance
I'll take it
I've waited so long
And baby this time
I can make it

By myself
It's so clear to me
By myself
There's no stopping me
I'll get by
Starting over again

For once in my life
I got a chance
I'll take it
I've waited so long
And baby this time
I can make it

For once in my life
I got a chance
I'll take it
I've waited so long
And baby this time
I can make it

By myself
Starting over again
By myself
Looks like this time
I'm on my own
Starting over again

Starting over again
Starting over again
Starting over again
