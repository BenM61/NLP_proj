Just as we turn
To the wind our eyes have
Lost their chill
Clean as the motion of time
Across my brow
Though the minutes
Just of what they are not now
The stars have gone to guard
The open sky

Just as the voice of the sea may writhe
Stars alike
So may the rivers of dawn
Reveal our days
Turning visions to explore the
Creature's ways
The time has come to gaze into the sky

Turn the light of life upon the fountain
Kindle everything
Demons of the pine within the billion
Fires in the bay
Praise the hour of new delight
Tear the silence of shallow light
Call the watchers of summer light
Read the mornings name

Come the fury shattering the stillness
Wind the open way
Reach the stars were swallowing the fullness
Ours is today
Praise the hour of new delight
Tear the silence of shallow light
Call the watchers of summer light
Read the mornings name

Golden wonders fill
The edges of the sky
Reach the fibers in
The timber of our lives
Such as the wilderness
Be under our eyes
As we turn the to the colder light
Of dawn

Turn the light of life upon the fountain
Kindle everything
Beavers of the pine upon the billion
Fires in the way
Praise the hour of new delight
Tear the silence of shallow light
Call the watchers of summer light
Read the mornings name

The flooding hours fill me
Turning our eyes upon the floor
The glowing waters thrill me
Melting ourselves within the glow
The flooding hours fill me
Turning our eyes upon the floor

Turning to reach the fountain
Fire of the morning
Watchers of the morning
Fire of the fountain
