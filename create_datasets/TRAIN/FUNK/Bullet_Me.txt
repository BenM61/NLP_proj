I t feels like I'm burning inside
Can you help me with some water
I sleep all day and stay up all night
I think I ought to see a doctor
I can't get no credit no more
All I've got is in my hands
And I can no longer ignore
Where the situation stands
Duncan arrives with a gun in his hand
He is the man
He makes things easy
Duncan arrives with a gun in his hand
He is the man
He makes things easily
He makes things easily
You might think that it's a crazy idea
But I can't get out of my debt
So bullet bullet bullet my head
And get the situation set
Duncan arrives with a gun in his hand
He is the man
He makes things easy
Duncan arrives with a gun in his hand
He is the man
He makes things easily
He makes things easily
You might think that it's a crazy idea
But I can't get out of my debt
So bullet bullet bullet my head
And get the situation set
Bullet me
Bullet me
I take the full responsibility
Bullet me
Bullet me
I take the full responsibility
Now I take my steps in heaven
I got it over with
Duncan is back to work again
He got away with it
Oh everything is lovely
I love the human race
So I begin
I begin all over again
