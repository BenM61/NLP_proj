Ridin high, gettin low
Ridin high, gettin low, doin wrong
And I get lost, in your love
I get lost, in your love and it's strong

All my time, in this world
All my time, in this world I've been alone
All I need, is a look
Just a look from your eyes and I get hooked, yeah

Take it back, the way we was
Take it back, back the way we was now

Woah, Woahoo
Woah, Woahoo
Woah, Woahoo
Woah, Woahoo

Like it loose, like it free
Get me all the way down to my knee
And I breathe, and I sigh
And I fill up my lungs and I cry

I get all the way home
I get all the way home then I leave
Every time, that you call
They just know me 'cause since I, well I be all

Take it back, the way we was
Take it back, back the way we was now

Woah, Woahoo
Woah, Woahoo
Woah, Woahoo
Woah, Woahoo

All my time, in this world
All my time, in this world I've been alone
All I need, is a look
Just a look from your eyes and I get hooked

I wanna slip down the alleyway
Sneakin' out the pen way
Middle finger push hole
Peakin' at you through the wall
I know you got my diamond ring
I caught you on the television
Dancing like a merry go
That's how the story goes

Take it back, the way we was
Take it back, back the way we was now

Woah, Woahoo
Woah, Woahoo
Woah, Woahoo
Woah, Woahoo

Woah, Woahoo
(won't you take it back)
Woah, Woahoo
(c'mon, won't you take it back)
Woah, Woahoo
(c'mon won't you take it back)
Woah, Woahoo
(c'mon won't you take it back)
