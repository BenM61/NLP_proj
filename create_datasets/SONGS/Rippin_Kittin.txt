Mommy, can I go out and kill tonight?
I feel, I feel like taking a life
Please, I want to seal the kitchen knife
And feel, feel like taking a life

Daddy, can I go out and hunt tonight
Like you do on Sunday mornings
Honey, give me a real gentle knife
To feel, feel like taking my life

Mommy, can I go out and kill tonight?
I feel, I feel like taking a life
Please, I want to seal the kitchen knife
And feel, feel like taking a life
