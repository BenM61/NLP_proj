Summer nights and the living is high
And wouldn't you know it
There's big old full moon rising up in the sky
And you know it's right the perfect night
For homemade ice-cream

I can see those lightning buzz and the river flow
There's an old harmonica playing soft and low
And folks back home out on the front porch
Eating homemade ice-cream

But it's a shame that it's only in my mind
'Cause I'm stuck up here in the city
Don't you know it's a pity
I'm grounded in making homemade ice-cream
