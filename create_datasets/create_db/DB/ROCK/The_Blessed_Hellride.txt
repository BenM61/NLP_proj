Break me down and roll me once again
Got no time to think of now and then
Catch my breath pick myself up off the floor 
One more drink, a nervous breakdown, then another war 
Oh, you can never get too low,
When you're so damn high
Oh, been out rolling
On the blessed hellride

Through the lines, ain't no in betweens
Gardens of filth, the obscure and the obscene
Catch my breath, pick myself up off the floor 
One more drink, a nervous breakdown, then another war

Oh, you can never get too low when you're so damn high
Oh, been out rolling, on the blessed hellride
You can never get too low when you're so damn high,
On the blessed hellride

Oh, you can never get too low when you're so damn high
Oh, been out rolling, on the blessed hellride
You can never get too low when you're so damn high,
On the blessed hellride
