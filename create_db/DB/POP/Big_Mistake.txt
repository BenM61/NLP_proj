Woke up in a daze got me feeling so strange
We're so damn far from that honeymoon phase
Taught you how to love, taught you how to be brave
Then you had to try and throw it all in my face

You said that I'd need you
You said that I'd miss you
But you're just a chapter that I know I'll forget
'Cause you are just all talk
The truth is you're so lost
If we had it all then you've got nothing left

I've forgotten how to love because of you
I know that I'll be OK
Oh you were my big mistake
I got stuck in limbo 'cause of you
I know that I'll be OK
Oh you were my big, my big mistake

You were my, you were my, you were my big mistake
You were my, you were my, you were my big mistake
You were my, you were my, you were my big mistake
You were my, you were my, you were my big mistake

You were spending hours at the place where we met
Thinking someone else would make you feel like I did
And all your little posts tryna make me regret
They're just a distraction till you call me again

You said that I'd need you
You said that I'd miss you
But you're just a chapter that I know I'll forget
'Cause you are just all talk
The truth is you're so lost
If we had it all then you've got nothing left

I've forgotten how to love because of you
I know that I'll be OK
Oh you were my big mistake
I-I-I got stuck in limbo 'cause of you
I know that I'll be OK
Oh you were my big, my big mistake

You were my, you were my, you were my big mistake
You were my, you were my, you were my big mistake
You were my, you were my, you were my big mistake
You were my, you were my, you were my big mistake

One day you gon' wake up
Missing something you can't replace, yeah
You gon' try to make up
But sorry's just a little too late

Oh you were my big-

I've forgotten how to love because of you
I know that I'll be OK
Oh you were my big mistake (my big mistake)
I got stuck in limbo 'cause of you (oh)
I know that I'll be OK
Oh you were my big, my big mistake

You were my, you were my, you were my big mistake (my big mistake)
You were my, you were my, you were my big mistake
You were my, you were my, you were my big mistake (my big mistake)
You were my, you were my, you were my big mistake
