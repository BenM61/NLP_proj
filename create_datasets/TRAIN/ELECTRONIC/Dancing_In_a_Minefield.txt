This train it goes this way, tonight we can't go back
It's all that I can wait for,
While I was standing here, you took your high heels off
And let the sun sink in, and kick it back

Leave all your mores behind,
'Cause we will party from the inside
Don't check that watch you're here to stay
And we will dance and dance and dance the night away
(Do do do do)

And we were dropping bombs with our sneakers on,
And we were dancing in a minefield with a bottle of whiskey.
'Cause you can't tell us what to do.
And we were winning the war with a lighter and a peace pipe.
And through the barricades they'll push their hate.

We were makin' noise with electric toys, and there were boys kissing boys at the moment when the cops came
They said hey, we won't run away.
And they pushed us back, and we pushed them back yeah we held our ground in their morality police state.
Kick us out and we'll be back again, tonight if not today.

The girls looked beautiful in blue.
One took my hand and said I love you,
I know I'll never know your name,
Yeah but it's okay, we'll love for just today

We were dropping bombs with our sneakers on and we were dancing in a minefield with bottle of whiskey.
'Cause you can't you can't you can't tell us what to do!
And we were winning the war with a lighter and a peace pipe.
And we'll break it down, break it down,
Break it down down today!
I know we'll deal with it tomorrow.
We feel that its okay to question why
Question why, yeah question why this lifestyle defies
The meaning of life.

But not to us.
