Loss of vision brain contusion sight and short of breath
Heartbeat pounding, pulse is slowing light has turned to black
Excruciating agony have you lost your will to live?
Perpetuating destiny it's in your hands to give
Staring at the crypts of death
Certain mortal perishment
There is no will to give
Existence has reached its end

There is no perplexity end of life's expectancy
Stripped of life's vitality certain death

Pressure building inside your head 
Compression pushing to the red
Limbs are numb, control is lost
Bag of blood is about to bust
Searching for the strength to grasp your life span is flashing fast
Now your time has come to pass
Thickening blood will now delay
Pulse has quickened, but too late
Melting braincells die away
Cranium dripping, oozing gray
Ever lasting intensity perpetuating destiny
Excruciating agony certain death

Covered in gore by butchery
Constant flowing ecstasy
Grasping life you feel it slip 
Death awaits you at the crypts

There is no perplexity end of life's expectancy
Stripped of life's vitality certain death
