Yeah
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Sorry it's gotta be this way
Ain't mean to try to desert you
Sorry, tryna be this way
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really mean to hurt you

Ain't really mean to hurt you
Sorry it's gotta be that way
Ain't mean to desert you
Sorry that it looks that way
Ain't really tryna hurt you
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really tryna hurt you
Sorry it's gotta be that way
Ain't really tryin'
I ain't really tryin'

I was in the U.K. thinkin', shit don't feel the same
Addy got me daydreamin', hope I ain't goin' insane
Hard to say you care about me, when this mink draggin' to the floor
Tryna find a PYT, I already got some at home
I breathe the air she breathes
It's hard to breathe on my own
It's so not different than the tea
Make me check every single stone
Gotta drink my blood like a Hebrew
'Cause I've been gettin' fly, sippin' diesel
Made her spit sides in Ibiza
I can get you off in Belgium
Tryna shine me off very seldom
Grab a couple chicks, then nail them
Take 'em to the hood, then sell them
Fam come first, you never fail them
Rebellious, always respect my elders
That's why I might treat you like I'm careless
Sold crack to a pregnant lady
Forgive me for the crack baby
If I open up my eyes, it turn black for real
Pack was too small, I ain't have it vacuum sealed
Word to Uncle Charles, nigga I got the sack for real
Money, broads, lawyers cost a half a mil'
Fame change, the family loves the way it is
Fame change, a ho loves the way I give
Baby mama steaks like a drug deal
Baby mama steaks like a drug deal

Ain't really mean to hurt you
Sorry it's gotta be this way
Ain't mean to try to desert you
Sorry, tryna be this way
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really tryin'

It can get scary when you legendary
Caramel complexion, that's a Halle Berry
Cash rules everything around music
The game doped up, every nigga usin'
Grab the .50 carbon, hit him with the tool
I'm not tryna argue, I got issues
You see what I've been put up against, baby
You see why I've been tryna make the rent, baby
Tryna keep you closer than lint, baby
Dime rose, 'bout to get lynched, baby
It's hard to convince you
All your bad energy, it's hard to bless you
Commercial flights gettin' too hectic
V12 motors, my confession
Tryna identify you, you look sketchy
I'm a real nigga, it's hard to accept me

Ain't really mean to hurt you
Sorry it's gotta be this way
Ain't mean to try to desert you
Sorry, tryna be this way
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really tryin'

Hot tenderoni, Bobby Brown ooh
Shorty's so phony, I got somethin' to prove
Work every day like I got somethin' to lose
I'm sick, I got me flown up, nothin' ain't that new
Styrofoam cups, everything is approved
Styrofoam cups, everything is approved
Money stand up and it got me seduced
I got that hot though, but I got that loose though
Ayy, my Lamb hit a pothole, these bitches some thot hoes
I hit the lotto in South Africano
Yacht party, sittin' at the dock of the condo
Better not be late, bitch, you better come pronto
Better come with a combo
Asian persuasion, Cubana, mi ana
Yolanda, Sholanda, Miyana, Mufasa
I don't know Spanish, I barely talk proper
Implicate problems when I did send flowers
King like Mufasa, messiah, then higher
Goshies and Rollies, I f*ck on a police
Shout out my woadie, he smashin' the CO
My wrist got an ego, my watch in an igloo
We took illegal, got stripes like a zebru
Built like a rollin' stone, high when I greet you
Diamonds just stall on you, efficiently ball on you
L-o-to-v-e, I hope you get greedy
Chasers do numbers, man chasers on VG
Couldn't have your heart 'cause you gave it to easy
Diamonds on sight is way brighter than Jeezy
Shout out to DD, got goonies on speedy
She like it rated, ain't nothin' 'bout her PG
I had it, made it, I thought I was jaded
Persian, Malaysian, super sensation
Yah, sushi was raw when she got confiscated
No invitations, we showed up and made it
Long as my dawgs and bitches betrayed you
Pigeons contagious, I shoulda known that
I turned the pages, heavily sedated
Too many clone me, too many phonies
Armani on me, you never warned me
How can you blame us when we all out the trenches?
Gold chains and rings, they're so easily gettin' offended
Spendin' all your show money tryna keep up with my image
F*ck around, take a whole frame and never give a penny
F*ck y'all, I skrrt off 'cause everything shitty
I hit my first model stepped up my pimpin'
Caught her off the runway, she instantly committed
Paper got my mind gone, too caught up on my city
In and out of time zones, runnin' up a billi'
Indian Cherokee, clarity
Shinin' is therapy, mami Israeli
Mami Israeli

Ain't really mean to hurt you
Sorry it's gotta be this way
Ain't mean to try to desert you
Sorry, tryna be this way
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Sorry it's gotta be that way
Ain't mean to desert you
Sorry that it looks that way
Ain't really tryna hurt you
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really tryna
