Oh so lonely
If only you
Would pull through

Things we have learnt
Now we have returned
We find it strange
To find nothing exchanged

I've been out of the way
I've been out of the way

This is a blast
To the past
Better late
Than bitter and lost

I've been out of my mind
I've been out of my mind to find you

Oh so lonely
If only you would pull through

Fire burn
Money is earned
I found a friend
Money is burned

I've been out of my mind
I've been out of my mind to find you

Things I have learnt
Now I have returned
I find it strange to find nothing has changed

I've been out of the way
