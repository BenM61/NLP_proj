Some of my favorite colors in the world
Beat against my eyelids
With the blues of green hummingbirds

Some of my favorite colors in the world
Beat against my eyelids
With the reds of pink hummingbirds

Blue moon, so white
So scared to come out tonight
It's too dark for him
He's just a boy with a man's grin

Crane and the swan
Wingspan across lake's silver light
The ivory night

Some of my favorite colors in the world
Beat against my eyelids
With the blues of green hummingbirds

Some of my favorite colors in the world
Beat against my eyelids
With the reds of pink hummingbirds

Godiva girl
Swimming in chocolate
Winged foil heart cardinals
Oh, but February stopped it
Red bird scared white
She's just a girl with a woman's smile

Crane and the swan
Wingspan across green apple ponds
And red apple skies

Some of my favorite colors in the world
Beat against my eyelids
With the blues of green hummingbirds

Some of my favorite colors in the world
Beat against my eyelids
With the reds of pink hummingbirds

With the reds of pink hummingbirds
(hummingbirds...)

I want to be mean
I want to be queen
I want to be marvelous
Paint me the colors of

Some of my favorite colors in the world
Beat against my eyelids
With the blues of green hummingbirds

Some of my favorite colors in the world
Beat against my eyelids
With the reds of pink hummingbirds
