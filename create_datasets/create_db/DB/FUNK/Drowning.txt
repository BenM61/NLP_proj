You tried to lie, I can see that you don't need me
(That you don't need me, that you don't need me)
All of your words, they have been cursed with dishonesty
(With dishonesty, with dishonesty)

Take it from the girl you claimed to love
You gonna get some bad karma
I'm the one who had to learn to build a heart made of armor
From the girl who made you soup and tied your shoes when you were hurting
You are not deserving, you are not deserving

I can see that you wanted me cold
You're so bold, why you're watching me moan?

You tried to hide, I can see that you don't see me
(that you don't see me, that you don't see me)
What do you gain by the names that you're calling me
(That you're calling me, that you're calling me)

Take it from the girl you claimed to love
You gonna get some bad karma
I'm the one who had to learn to build a heart made of armor
From the girl who made you soup and tied your shoes when you were hurting
You are not deserving, you are not deserving

('Cause I'm drowning for ya)
I can see that you wanting me cold
You're so bold, why you're watching me moan?

Holding it up
Like you can pull me down
'Cause I'm drowning for ya
('Cause I'm drowning for ya)
'Cause I'm drowning for ya

Can you follow me up to the water?
You can show me the sinking deeper
Let me know
'Cause I'm drowning for ya
Can you follow me up to the water?
You can show me the sinking deeper
Let me know
'Cause I'm drowning for ya
Can you follow me up to the water?
You can show me the sinking deeper
Let me know
'Cause I'm drowning for ya
Can you follow me up to the water?
You can show me the sinking deeper
Let me know
'Cause I'm drowning for ya

('Cause I'm drowning for ya)
