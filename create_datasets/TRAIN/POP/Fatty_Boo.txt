Hey, nicknamed Fatty Boo with a name Lisa
She no have no boyfriend, she live up the fridge freezer
Triple chin or facial hair, she favor geezer
Although she friend recommend, certain cream and tease her

She favorite tipple is Bacardi Breezer
Claim she's thirty one but no one believe her
Love randomer restaurant with she friend Anita
You should meet her, Anita's another big eater

Slipped disc for the waiter then there's always a feature
When they run go carrying food for them two creature
One night she come so much rice she nearly have a seizure
Fall off she chair, licked she head and catch amnesia

Wake up in A and E and bellows she want pizza
(Give me food, ya)
Doctors quickly sign paper and release her
(One time)
Cough, 'nough police to police her
Fatty Boo you better pray nobody sees ya
(This time)

Be careful of the things that you do
Say now you got plenty but the plenty could be few
This is my chance to shout it in other avenue
Say don't you be a sinner, don't you keep all for you, yeah

I said a long time no you start warm as a ripple
Every little dime, every nickel, you are trouble
Watch you're little head, Fatty Boo
And give the dog a bone that could never be for you

Nicknamed Fatty Boo but we call her Mel life
Changed forever when she discovered channel
Now she has a mind to buy designer apparel
She no, favor gazelle but she bounced like hell

Whenever she spya something to die for on the fashion channel
(Seventeen breezer, choom)
And one like Tinker Bell, fatty, big like two church bell in parallel
Cats walk and Mel never match up too well

But fatty was saucy, couldn't be told
She loved margo with her big nick, drifling the cold
She even bolder than the skinny girls, shoulder less
(They're mine)
And admired everywhere from her openness

Microphone check one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two

Be careful of the things that you do
Say now you got plenty but the plenty could be few
This is my chance to shout it in other avenue
Say don't you be a sinner, don't you keep all for you

Yeah, I said a long time no you start warm as a ripple
Every little dime, every nickel, you are trouble
Watch you're little head, fatty boo
And give the dog a bone that could never be for you

Be careful of the things that you do
Say now you've got plenty but the plenty could be few

Yeah, I said a long time no you start warm as a ripple
Watch you're little head Fatty Boo
And give the dog a bone that could never be for you

Be careful of the things that you do
Say now you got plenty but the plenty could be few
This is my chance to shout it in other avenue
Say don't you be a sinner, don't you keep all for you

Yeah, I said a long time no you start warm as a ripple
Every little dime, every nickel, you are trouble
Watch you're little head, Fatty Boo
And give the dog a bone that could never be for you

Finally Fatty Boo you stood with me in '73
Saturday night playing the music at my father's party
Six records on the changer often with Dan Settee
Still your gram six years old and I'm the man

Steady with calypso to start then play reggae
One thousand bolts of holts, huh, for everybody
In the days when R&B meant Arthur Conroy
Otis Reading, Booker T and the MG's

Every, little piece of attention as we tried to squeeze
From the father, his friends and their families
Sometime deliberately tease with the tune that won't please
And the whole room reaction set my young heart at ease

It used to be black suits and shirts with skinny ties
And they was wise and funny and funny and wise
Staying up late and playing the music
With grown ups was my prize
The little fat kid with sparkling eyes
