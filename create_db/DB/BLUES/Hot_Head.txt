She can burn you up in bed just like she said
Cause she's a hot head, hot head, hot head

She can boil a pot a' joe, she can start a pile a' dough, she's a hot head

She puts your head into the fire, makes your red-hot perspire, she's a hot head

She was burned before she was born, burnin up a storm, she's a hot head

Lick out like a flame, and burn you to a shame
Bite a burnin flame

She's a hobo wire-toaster
She's a circle on a spit (Ssssss!)

She can stick you to a wheel
Baste you to a fire
Spin you round and round
Boil your britches down
(Fire, fire, fire!)

She can burn you up in bed, she can boil you up instead, she's a hot head

She can lick out like a flame, burn you to a shame
