I talked to you today, we've loved each other
For so long in that special way
And if circumstances should keep us apart
I just want you to know
That you will remain forever here in my heart

Sweet, sweet bitter love
The taste still lingers, though through my helpless fingers
You slipped away, ooh, yes you did

Sweet, sweet bitter love, what joy you taught me
What pain you didn't mean to but you brought me
And so shall, baby and so shall it stay

My magic dreams have lost their spell
And where there, where there was hope
Oh, there is an empty shell

Oh, sweet, my my my, my my my, my my, bitter love
Why have you awakened and then you've forsaken
A trusting heart like mine

My magic, my magic dreams
They've all, they've all, all lost their spells
And where there, where there was a little bit of hope
Yes sir, there is, oh look at me now, there is an empty shell

Oh, sweet, my my my, my my my, my my, bitter love
Why have you awakened and then
And then and then and then and then you know, you have forsaken
A trusting heart, yeah like mine, a trusting heart like mine
I love you boy, yes I do, like mine
