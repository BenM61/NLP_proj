Seventy-seven million dollars made from watching me cum
Under the sun on my vacation
After hours on spectra vision
Shootin' my jizzy-jizzum
The woody has rizzy-risen
I ain't gettin' paid to entertain
Your bridal showers
Rockin' my porno tape for hours and 
hours, yeah
Clitorises are fearin' me
It's bigger than Ron Jeremy

Cause it's them ass cheeks
That make my ass weak
And I've been ridin' with the blue balls 
since last week
So if you ask me
I'll be glad to speak
After we get butt naked and break it 
down nasty

Get, get Naked (C'mon baby make it hot)
Get, get Naked (Ride the cock til' you hit 
the spot)
Get, get Naked, (C'mon baby make it hot)
Get, Get Naked

Doin' it doggy-style
Bow-wow-wow-yipee-yo-yipee-yeah
Bow-wow-yipee-yo-yipee-yeah
Bow-wow-wow-yipee-yo-yipee-yeah
Bow-wow-yipee-yo-yipee...

The little ganja ho from Tokyo
Who said she could blow
Ten dollar love me long time in the limo
But really doh
I'm just tryin' to fly with the flows
Freak up some ho's, blow up the shows
Make a little dough, as if you didn't know
Back in the strip club, I'm freakin' up more ho's
Swingin' my ding-a-ling, it ain't no thing

It's those intergalactic ho's who came out of those space probes
Fine green honey's representin' with no clothes
Mixmaster Mike, Mixmaster Mike...oh God, oh, makin' the pussy tight
No jimmy, no gimme no lust
In the Methods of Mayhem we trust, it's a must
So rip off your clothes and expose your bust

Cause it's them ass cheeks
That make my ass weak
And I've been ridin' with the blue balls 
since last week
So if you ask me
I'll be glad to speak
After we get butt naked and break it 
down nasty

Get, get Naked (C'mon baby make it hot)
Get, get Naked (Ride the cock til' you hit 
the spot)
Get, get Naked, (C'mon baby make it hot)
Get, Get Naked

You only love me when you want punani

Queen bitch, the red lipstick, the all black heart
Call me Black Bart
F*ck a blow-job, this a motherfuckin' heart
Under seven inches? Eh! Sorry
Mini-men I can't f*ck with them
I like to ride the cock til' you hit the spot
C'mon baby make it hot, got a convertible?
Drop the top
Before we do a thing I want the diamonds and the rings
The furs, the minks, the jewels, the links
You know I'm freaky, so ya gotta eat me
And I know you hate it but um...
Get Naked

You ain't lickin this, you ain't stickin this
We don't want your dick

F*ck the dumb games and girls that complain
And I ain't leavin' til' you're sleeping on a cum stain
F*ck the dumb games and girls that complain
And I ain't leavin' til' you're sleeping on a cum stain

Get, get Naked (C'mon baby make it hot)
Get, get Naked (Ride the cock til' you hit 
the spot)
Get, get Naked, (C'mon baby make it hot)
Get, Get Naked
