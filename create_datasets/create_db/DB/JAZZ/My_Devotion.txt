My devotion
Is endless and deep as the ocean
And like a star shining from afar
Remains forever the same

My devotion
Is not just a sudden emotion
It will be constantly burning
And your love will kindle the flame

What a sweet beginning
To the dream I planned
I'm content to be your slave
Your wish is my command

And this sensation
Was never a mere fascination
Here in my heart one sweet day it started
Then with time improved
My devotion to you.
