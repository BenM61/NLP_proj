(Verse One): Afu-Ra
Peep the finisher, blemisher, menace to sinister
It's him with the, been with the, mic's Next to kin with the
Lyrical assassinate like toxic waste
Rocks is base, matches I burn up in your face
Travel through eons, mentally to spit it viciously
Slapping up these red-eyed devils, speaking fictitiously
They slipping be	, snippin the, mic styles they slippery
A golden aura, it backs the voice you can't ignore the
Monumental essence, which crowds wish to adore the
Shimmering stone, lace like stylish, luscious, Tiffany
Sages when they meditate, prism filling my imagery
Subliminally, thoughts I set it, Synchronisticaly
The intricacy, complex levels my entity
No stopping me, I'm rocking the, Hip-Hop philosophy
Drummer drum it, preserve myself to keep me omni-potent
9 9 styles I keep it flowing

"Randomly flip on bystanders"
