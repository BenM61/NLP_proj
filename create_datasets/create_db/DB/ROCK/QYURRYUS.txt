Hot track
Hot dress
Undressing this hot mess

Gettin' off, the west side
All day on a roof on the west side

Hot dress
Undressing this hot mess

Gettin' off, the west side
All day on a roof on the west side

The public is confused
Prison Jazz virtue
He knows the truth
If he thinks it through
Minor but major, I was gonna say
That's not your problem, at least not today

I lost what's mine
Little Habibi
I lost what's mine
Trusting systems of the law
I lost what's mine
Somebody (help)
I lost what's mine
Odd creatures, walking tall
I lost what's mine
I did the London Eye
I lost what's mine
Like anyone I know
I lost what's mine
Guess it was never mine
I lost what's mine
Get me back and I'm a child
I lost what's mine
I want my mama and my eyes
I lost what's mine
Oh
I lost what's mine
My side
I lost what's mine
