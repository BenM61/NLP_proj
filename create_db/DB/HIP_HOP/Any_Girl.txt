Ah ah ah?

Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Long time in the making huh??
I, I got em like! Like! Like!

Uh!
L, Banks baby balla' of the year
Got about nine, ten dimes, and all of 'em is here
It don't matter, cause before the night is done I disappear
Tell my new one I'm leavin' outta' the side
Meet me there
Yeah
Weed and bottles everywhere
Metal fulla' hollows
I don't mind a petty stare
I don't need a favor
Baby, I'm a millionaire
Got a show hoppin outta' the leer in Tanzania
You ain't gettin' nothin'
You ain't gettin' money
Money make a mack more
More Henney more honeys
Hunned' dolla' bills, fifty dolla' billz, keep the 20's
Dummy, I'ma' go-getta', bitter, old nigga, spitter
Gold-digger, couldn't dig ya'self a chip
Dig ya'self a hole, told 'em I was cold from the rip
Zero zero man, need more of those in my shi!
Hoes in my whip, Mo'(et) till I'm sick
I'm rich!

Ladies, they love me
They' eyes are on my money
They pay me and I stunt
And I can have any girl I want

Go shawty go shawty go
Go shawty go shawty go

Go shawty go shawty go
Go, go, go, go!

Uh
Black Bimmer, blue Benz, red Bentley
Audemar sporter, y'all
All a' y'all petty
Heavy metal hangin'
Chain danglin' on me while I'm boppin'
I can, see the whole crowd watchin' while we rockin'
Coppin', bottle-poppin'
Pop a cork like a sport
Hit a hater in the nose when I open my rose
L.V's and G's all over my clothes
Bank rolls everywhere Banks goes
She ain't yours
As far as flows, mine's like an automatic
Mack 11 or dumb dumb'll quiet all the static
I gotta' habit
I'm fuckin' like an addict
Area code scattered from the way I work magic
So tragic
Nigga run up on me wrong
Grown ass whippin' bout 2:30 in the morn
Cases of white brown and bottles of the Don
The chron chron and girls on my arm
It's on!

Ladies, they love me
They' eyes are on my money
They pay me and I stunt
And I can have any girl I want

I got 'em like!

Go shawty go shawty go
