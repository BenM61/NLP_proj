Continually experimenting with new ideas and techniques
Reconstructing
Developing
Modernising

I believe, I believe
In progress, in progress

Machines will do the heavy work
Men will supervise the machines (I believe in progress)
You owe much to these machines (I believe in progress)
Horsepower, not manpower (I believe in progress)
Brains, not brawn (I believe)

I believe, I believe
In progress, in progress

I believe, I believe
In progress, in progress

These men look the same as they have always looked
They talk as they have always talked
But before your eyes they are changing

(I believe in progress)
(I believe in progress)
(I believe in progress)
(I believe in progress)

I believe, I believe
In progress, in progress

I believe, I believe
In progress, in progress

I believe, I believe
In progress, in progress

I believe in progress
