Lover of mine
Gone to a faraway land
Serving your country
On some faraway sand
But you should get no name
Remember that your heart belongs to me

I'm sending you a picture
To carry with you all the time
So when you're feeling lonely
It's something to remind you 
I'm thinking of you constantly
Remember that your hearts belongs to me
Your heart belongs to me

If a pretty girl should pass you by
I won't mind
If you give her the eye
Or even if you give her a smile sometimes
But keep your heart
Because your heart is mine
Your heart is mine
Your heart is mine

Lover of mine
If I could tell you how I yearn
For the day to come
When you will return
From far across the sea
So remember that your heart belongs to me
Remember your heart belongs to me
Far across the sea
