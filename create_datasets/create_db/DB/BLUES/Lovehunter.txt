I need a woman to treat me good 
And give me everything a good woman should. 
Everyday and every night 
She'd be waiting on her brown-eyed boy 
To come and treat her right. 

[Chorus]
I'm a love hunter baby 
Sneaking up on you, 
I'm a love hunter baby 
Sneaking up on you. 
I'm gonna give you all my loving 
And use my tail on you. 

In my time I've been a back door man, 
I've taken everything I could 
But, I've given all I can. 
I don't want no woman 
To weep or moan, 
I'm looking for a sweet heart breaker 
And I'm never gonna leave her alone. 

[Chorus: x2]

Cause I'm a love hunter baby, 
I'm a love hunter baby

I'm a love hunter baby 
Sneaking up on you. 

I'm sneaking up on you.
