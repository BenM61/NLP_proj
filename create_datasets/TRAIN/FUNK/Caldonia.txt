Walking with my baby
She got great big feet
She's long, lean and lanky
Ain't had nothing to eat

But she's my baby
I love her just the same
Crazy bout that woman
Cause Caldonia is her name

Caldonia, Caldonia
What make your big head so hard
I love you, I love you just the same
Crazy bout that woman
Cause Caldonia is her name

I don't know what's wrong with her

Someone gotta change right here now

I wanna tell you something
You know, my mama told me
To leave Caldonia alone

(What's the matter with her

What's the matter with her)
I don't know, she says she's no good
She said, son, said, keep away from
That woman, she ain't no good at all

(She must have made a mistake, brother)
Yeah, with mama, there's always
God know what's down
(That's what I thought)

So I'm going down to her
House just one more time
(All right, all right
I'll wait for you)

Caldonia, Caldonia
What make your big head so hard
I love you, I love you just the same
Crazy bout that woman
'Cause Caldonia is her name
