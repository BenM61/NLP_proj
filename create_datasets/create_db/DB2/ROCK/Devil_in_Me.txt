Got the devil's disease
I've got the jealous in me
So to the jail I plead
He put the devil in me
When he said he would leave
After he stole my heart
And broke it apart
You know that hell ends with me
I am your ticket to free
Don't let it end like this
Without my kiss

Oh, and you go
You walk out on me, baby
And leave me for another lady
I'll drink
I'll drink until you love me
And wake up always thinking of me
You are
You are the devil in me

All I wanted was you
The fairytale you sold me
A taste of what you had told me
You put the stagger in me
You wanna see if I bleed
I leave a dagger in you
Now who sings those blues

Oh, and you go
You walk out on me, baby
And leave me for another lady
I'll drink
I'll drink until you love me
And wake up always thinking of me
You are
You are the devil in me

You are the devil in me

Oh, and you go
You walk out on me, baby
And leave me for another lady
I'll drink
I'll drink until you love me
And wake up always thinking of me
You are
You are the devil in me
