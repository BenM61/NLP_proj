I saw my love walking down the aisle
And as he passed me by 
He turned and gave me a smile
Then, the preacher, then the preacher
The preacher joined their hands
And all the people, all the people began to stand
When I shouted, "you know it should have been me"
(Instead of her walking with you)

You are leaving me stranded 
You know that it should have been me baby 
Oh baby gettin' ready to marry you
Darlin' darlin' darlin'
You made a promise that we would never part
Then you turned around and broke my little heart
Now you're standing there saying I do 
Holding hands with somebody new
You know that it should have been me
(I can't stand it)
Instead of her standing by you
You know that it should have been me
It should have been me
(Baby don't do it)
Then the preacher oh yeah the preacher asked
That there be silence please

If anybody objects to this wedding 
Speak now or forever or forever hold your peace
Thin I shouted, "It should have been me"
You know that it should have been me
Don't you know that it should have been me
You know that it should have been me
I've been faithful to you baby, baby, baby 
You were leaving me stranded
