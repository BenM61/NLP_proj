I don't know where I'm going 
Its an un-chartered sky 
I don't I think even really know 
What I'm feeling inside 
Love is so uncertain 
Who can say whats in store 
This is deeper, farther, higher 
Than Ive been before 

I'm flying blind 
Wherever your love takes me 
I'm letting go and I don't care if I fall 
Ill close my eyes with you beside me 
I follow faith and let it guide me 
Tonight I'm leaving all my fears behind 
I'm flying blind 

I wont question tomorrow 
Its a mystery to me 
I just know what your touch in me does 
I know this is where I wanna be 
Its a risk worth taking 
I don't want to come down 
Play my heart 
Got my cards on the table 
Got my head up in the clouds
