Little things, that you do,
That we shared,
Me and you,
Air I breathe, 
You supply me with such wonder stuff
Just one touch is all I need

It feels like I'm falling into sun,
Even on stormy days in every way
It feels like we’re one
As we watch the years go by
Feels like we’re still flying high

Baby you amaze me,
You still knock me, off my feet
And who would have
Ever guessed
It would last through it all,
The reason I believe
Can’t you see?

You still amaze me
You still amaze me 

Funny how every time, that I’m down
You pick me up,
You stay by me
When people ask
"What’s the deal? Why you still so in love?"
And maybe
It’s meant to be

Feels like I’m falling into sun
Even when life is like, a fight
Feels like we’ve won
As we watch the years go by
Feels like we’re still flying high

Baby you amaze me,
You still knock me, off my feet
And who would have ever guessed
It will last through it all,
The reason I believe
Can’t you see?

You still amaze me
Still amaze me
Still amaze me

It feels like we're falling into sun,
Even on stormy days in every way
Feels like we’re one
As we watch the years go by
Feels like we’re still flying high

Baby you amaze me,
You still knock me, off my feet
And who would have ever guessed
It will last through it all,
The reason I believe
Can’t you see?

You still amaze me
You still amaze me

You still amaze me
You still amaze me

You still amaze me
