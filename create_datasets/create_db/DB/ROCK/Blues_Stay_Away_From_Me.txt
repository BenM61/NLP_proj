Well I say blues, stay away from me
Ooh-oh, blues, why don't you set me free
I don't know why, you keep a-hauntin' me
Blues stay away from me
Blues why don't you set me free
Don't know why we never can agree

Love was never meant for me
True love is just a memory
Seems somehow we never can agree
