Let your hair down baby
Let's have a natural ball
Let your hair down baby
Let's have a natural ball
Cause when you're not happy
It ain't no fun at all

You can't take it with you
That's one thing for sure
You can't take it with you baby
That's one thing for sure
There's nothing wrong with ya baby
That a good T-Bone shuffle can't cure

Have fun while ya can
Fate's an awful thing
Have fun while ya can
Fate's an awful thing
You can't tell what might happen
That's why I love to sing
