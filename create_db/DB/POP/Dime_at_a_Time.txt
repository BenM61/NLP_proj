My whole life's saving's a two dollar bill
That's why I'm here tonight I've got time to kill
And I can tell my story about twenty times
Two dollars in the jukebox one dime at a time

Two dollars in the jukebox a dime at a time
Play the same old song about a love gone wrong till closing time
Two dollars oughta do me if you'll buy the wine
And I'll put in the jukebox one dime at a time
And I'll put in the jukebox one dime at a time
