What is the name to call
For a different kind of girl
Who knows the feelings
Never the words?

To look at you and never speak
Is so good for me tonight
To look at you and never speak
Is so good for me tonight

What is the name to call
For a different kind of girl
Who knows the feelings
But never the words?

Who do you ask when there's no one left to turn to?
You ask me and I'll always try to hear
Past money and colors and make believe
Good cheap values for a thrifty clown

To look at you and never speak
Is so good for me tonight
To look at you and never speak
Is so good for me tonight
To look at you and never speak
Is so good for me tonight

What is the name to call
For a different kind of girl
Who knows the feelings
But never the words?

What do you fear in the simple
Still of a summer's night?
I understand, I sympathize for a day dream
Fairy tales and I love you

What is the name to call
For a different kind of girl
Who knows the feelings
But never the words
