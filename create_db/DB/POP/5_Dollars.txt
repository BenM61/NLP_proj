Every absent-minded day
I let myself carried away
Then you get five dollars, baby blues, five dollars baby

Kneeling down for all they cared
You let them pay and went ahead
It is still five dollars, baby blues, five dollars baby
Five dollars, baby blues, five dollars baby

You’re eager and unashamed
I grieve by dying every night, baby
Prove them wrong when you get five dollars
You’re eager and unashamed
I don’t think the race is over, baby
Prove them wrong when you get five dollars

Five dollars, baby blues, five dollars baby

Some of us just had to fight
For even being looked at right
Then you get five dollars, baby blues, five dollars baby

Pockets full and dried eyes
It turns me on because it’s timed
Now throw me five dollars baby blues, five dollars baby
Throw me five dollars baby blues, five dollars baby
Throw me five dollars baby blues, five dollars baby

You’re eager and unashamed
I grieve by dying every night, baby
Prove them wrong when you get five dollars

You’re eager and unashamed
I don’t think the race is over, baby
Prove them wrong when you get five dollars

Oh, you’re eager and unashamed
I grieve by dying every night, baby
Prove them wrong when you get five dollars

Oh, you’re eager and unashamed
And I don’t think the race is over, baby
Prove them wrong when you get five dollars
