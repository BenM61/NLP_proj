You want it, you need it
But you don't understand
And sometimes it hurt you
When things don't go as plan

Take your time to get it
Ooh, baby
Take your time to get it
But you can never give up

Take your time to get it
Oh, it hurts a little
Take your time to get it
I know you'll never give up

Don't ever surrender
You've got to take the chance
You've got to stay hungry
To be the best you can, oh baby

Take your time to get it
Ooh, baby
Take your time to get it
But you can never give up

Take your time to get it
Oh, it hurts a little
Take your time to get it
I know you'll never give up

Take your time

I know that you win
Shine your way back through
Just hold on, you better get ready
When all your dreams come true

Take your time to get it
Ooh, baby
Take your time to get it
But you can never give up

Take your time to get it
Oh, it hurts a little
Take your time to get it
I know you'll never give up

Don't let anybody tell you it's impossible
Don't let anybody tell you it's impossible

Take your time to get it
Baby
Take your time to get it
Oh, it hurts a little

Take your time to get it
Take your time to get it
Take your time to get it
Take your time to get it

Take your time to get it
Take your time to get it
Take your time to get it

If you want it, if you need it
So you gotta have it
You better take that time

If you want it, if you need it
So you gotta have it
Baby, you gotta take your time

Take your time to get it
Take your time to get it
Take your time to get it
