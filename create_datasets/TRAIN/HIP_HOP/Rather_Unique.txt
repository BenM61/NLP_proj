Rock the house
East New-York
Shout out my nigga AZ
East New-York

We was already molded into people's minds as mulignanes
Now we more fucked up with a mayor named Giuliani
You can try to blind me, analyze but can't define me
My mind's divine, heavily entwined with Gandhi's
Far from feeble, I leave your nostrils hard to breathe through
Cause my cerebrals are more of a higher plane than the Hebrews
My mic devotion brings out my deepest emotions
Overdosing wannabes posing, sending them through convulsions
Too hard to follow, you took a bite but couldn't swallow
Your mind's boggled, but I'm as deep as Donald Goines novels
My whole persona's kinda laid back like a recliner
And since a minor, I been fucking with marijuana
Wavy-haired, my skin got a money getting glare
Strictly menace wear, macking offa Guinness beer
So where it all begins is here, destiny and me finally meet
So how can I be weak? I'm rather unique

Why I'm rather unique (Check it out)

My verbals rip shit, brains give birth to thoughts in triplets
F*ck it I'm on some flip shit, ready to let my clip spit
Dramatical, vocals release shells like automatics do
Music's magical causing any battles to be tragical
Child, got a style sick as hell, sicker than sickle cell anemia
Slaughter your circulatory like lukemia
Filled with larceny, who want parts of me? I'm vicious
Mad malicious, cause it's real on this road to riches
I got this mastered, other rappers'll craft it
Weak and wicked camouflaged as killers how they speak and kick it
Peep this uniqueness, non-believers I'm leaving speechless
Left to choke as if skunk smoke was coming through the speakers
Surgically nice with any verbal device, trife
Breathing life into mics, my insight's beyond the twilight
So die or fight, no surrender, no retreat
Techniques speak, I'm rather unique

So it's gonna take more than your astrologist to knowledge this
A physiologist couldn't even figure out the exoticness
Raps demolishing certified the way I style it
My wordplay blaze with the rays of ultraviolet
My culture's smiling, getting more in depth with each breath
Autobiography follows the footsteps of Malcolm X
Money and sex, Gore-Tex, Donna Karan and Guess
Finesse, success through the life stress, mics I bless
Puffing trees to get me high as trapeze, looking Japanese
At ease when I'm stacking G's, so let's discuss, plus degrees
How the rhyme forces the source for thoughts that's lost
So don't cross cause it'll cost
The ghetto savior, smooth, the real playa with flavor
Moves be major, with un-explainable behavior
The word's on the street so keep your ears to the concrete

Why I'm rather unique (Check it out)
