Mm, eso beso, ooh that kiss
Aah, eso beso, ooh your kiss
It's got something, don't know what
But whatever it's got, it's got a lot

When we samba (the bossanova)
Close like this (the bossanova)
Ay, ay caramba (the bossanova)
Who unleashed that kiss ? (the bossanova)
Hold me closer and we'll soar
For the samba's the quickest way to make amor

As we dip and sway and caress this way
Samba seems to say "Love is here to stay"
Like the samba sound, my heart begins to pound
I go off the ground to where I'm poco-loco

Eso beso (the bossanova) ooh that kiss (the bossanova)
Eso beso (the bossanova) ooh your kiss (the bossanova)
Kiss me mucho and we'll soar
And we'll dance the dance of love forevermore

As we dip and sway we caress this way
Samba seems to say "Love is here to stay"
Like that samba sound, my heart begins to pound
And I go off the ground to where I'm poco-loco

Eso beso (the bossanova) ooh your kiss (the bossanova)
Kiss me mucho (the bossanova) I love your kiss (the bossanova)
Kiss me mucho and we'll soar
And we'll dance the dance of love forevermore

Ah this dance (the bossanova)
Ooh, romance (the bossanova)
I love that kiss (the bossanova)
Kiss me mucho (the bossanova)

A little more mucho (the bossanova)
Then we'll dance
Ah that kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss
Mucho, mucho, mucho
