If I'm beating every hand away
No one stays
I've got so cautious
And now I trip on every move I make
Let one play
To be that careless

With every kiss from a friend
With everything I pretend not to feel
Am I too high? Am I too proud?
Is the music too loud for me to hear?

Now I go out
But every beat is a violent noise
Dries my eye
With every beat comes a violent noise
The melody sung
And I don't know the voice
Now I go out
But every beat is a violent noise

You've been staying out late
Trying your best to escape
I hope you find what you're looking for
Let a moment take place
Without running away
I hope you silence the noise

How could eyes this wide
Lose sight of a world outside?
I've looked away, cowardice
With every kiss from a friend
With everything I pretend not to feel
Am I too high? Am I too proud?
Is the music too loud for me to hear?

Now I go out
But every beat is a violent noise
Dries my eye
With every beat comes a violent noise
The melody sung
And I don't know the voice
Now I go out
But every beat is a violent noise
