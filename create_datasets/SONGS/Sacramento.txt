I can't help but feeling that love is always dealing me a losing hand 
California's sleeping and you've got me weeping 
I am just a man 
I'm just a man 
I'm just a man 

Standing at the airport she is just a cohort coffee in her hand 
Sacramento's breathing and I can't help believing you don't understand 
Don't understand 
I'm just a man 
Don't understand 
I'm just a man 

California's sleeping and you've got me weeping 
I am just a man 
I can't help but feeling that love is always dealing me a losing hand 
My losing hand 
I'm just a man 

Standing at the airport she is just a cohort coffee in her hand 
Sacramento's breathing and I can't help believing conscious of my losing hand 
My losing hand 
My losing hand 
Don't Understand 
My losing hand 
Don't Understand 

California's sleeping and you've got me weeping 
I am just a man 
I can't help but feeling that love is always dealing me a losing hand 
My losing hand 
My losing hand 
Don't understand 
My losing hand 
Don't understand 
My losing hand 
Don't understand 
Don't understand 
Don't understand
