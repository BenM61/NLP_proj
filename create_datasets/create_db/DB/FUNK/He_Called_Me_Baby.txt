He called me baby, baby
All night long
Used to hold and kiss me
Till the dawn

Then one day I awoke
And he was gone
There's no more baby, baby
All night long

He called me baby, baby
All night long
Lord, I feel so empty
Since he's been gone

Now I lie here and I die here
Until the dawn
I miss my baby, baby, baby
All night long

He called me baby, baby, baby
All night long, yes, he did
Kiss my tears away
When things went wrong

What I'd give, what I'd give
If he'd come on back home
And call me baby, baby, baby
All night long, oh, yeah
Mmm hmm, yeah

He called me baby, baby
All night long
Held me up so high
And made me strong

Now each night in dreams
Just like a song
I can still hear baby, baby, baby
All night long

I can still hear
Baby, baby, baby, baby
All night long

I can still hear him
Calling me baby, baby, baby, baby
All night long

Oh, what you do
Is just hold me, baby
Squeeze me, baby
All night long

I just wanna hear you say baby
