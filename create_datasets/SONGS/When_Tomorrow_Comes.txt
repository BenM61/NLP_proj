It's easy for a love to come and go
Oh, yes, it is
For you to be thrilled just one time
Then want no more

Oh, darling, when tomorrow comes
Will you still want the love I got
Oh, tell me, when tomorrow
Comes and find us
Will my kisses still be hot

Now will your love for me be
The kind of love that lasts
When you reach out to hold me
Tomorrow, will you reach out that fast

Oh, I want to know
When tomorrow comes
Will the need still be there
Oh, my lover
When tomorrow comes and find us
Tell me will you, will you still care

What I'm trying to say is
I don't want just a one day lover
Today with me, tomorrow with another
What I want is an everyday man
To prove that loving over and
Over again, oh, yeah, uh huh

Darling, when tomorrow comes
Will the need still be there
When tomorrow comes and finds us
Tell me, will, will you still care

I wanna know when tomorrow comes
I wanna know will, will you still need me
When tomorrow comes
Will your kisses be the way
They're supposed to be

I wanna know, know, know
