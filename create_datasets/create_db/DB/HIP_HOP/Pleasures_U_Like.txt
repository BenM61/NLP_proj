Hey baby love
How you do that thing you do
Gonna be feeling you
fascinated when you pass my way
Baby I
I can't believe my eyes
You took a brother by surprise
I know I just want to take this dance with you baby

Go on a date on a Saturday night with you
Do whatever you want me to
Just don't matter I gotcha right here boo you know it's all you
Whatcha doin' all alone in this small filled room
Standing by the bar
Can't you tell that I'm feeling you

After hours we go rendezvous
Make a brother ditch his crew
Just to be with you
Lights out we gonna get into
Pleasures you like
(Pleasures you like)

My shorty love
How ya gonna just walk by
You need to give our love a try
So elevate me, stimulating from the look in your eyes
My my my my
The feelings you can't hide
Looks like you need some love tonight
