It's a long time coming, 
A long time gone away.
When the lights go down, don't stop.
No one stays the same.

Feel the waves that pull us under, 
The waiting wild inside.
You're too good at being patient.
In the right light, I've got nothing to hide.

More than what you are you are.
Tell me what you want tell me what you are.
More than what you are you are.
Tell me what you want tell me what you are.
More than what you are you are.
Tell me what you want tell me what you are.
More than what you are you are.
Tell me what you want tell me what you are.

I don't care where we're going.
I feel so far away.
In the backseat silver motion, 
We accelerate.

The others drive in circles, 
They give in and feel ashamed.
And if they find us out now, 
Better that way.

More than what you are you are.
Tell me what you want tell me what you are.
More than what you are you are.
Tell me what you want tell me what you are.
More than what you are you are.
Tell me what you want tell me what you are.
More than what you are you are.
Tell me what you want tell me what you are.

More than what you are you are.
Tell me what you want tell me what you are.
More than what you are you are.
Tell me what you want tell me what you are.
More than what you are you are.
Tell me what you want tell me what you are.
More than what you are you are.
Tell me what you want tell me what you are.
