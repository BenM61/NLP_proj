The clock is ticking on the table in my room
Funny how the time just slips away
An ordinary simple man 
Who's lost a little piece of something
Hold my breath and close my eyes
Say a little prayer
Here we go again hello
I didn't see the end and so the story goes
How can I be cool?
I always play the fool
I need a shot of love
Look an arrow through the heart
My mind is open to the page of yesterday
Isn't it a crime how love can go
I always knew there would come a day
When silence played the king of pain
So I close my eyes and hold my breath
And contemplate a change
Here we go again hello
I didn't see the end and so the story goes
How can I be cool?
I always play the fool
I need a shot of love
Like an arrow through the heart
I have my faith in life
I know the truth inside
This time I swear it's gonna be better
