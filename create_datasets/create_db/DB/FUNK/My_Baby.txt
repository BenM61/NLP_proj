My Baby - The Temptations
(R.Rogers,W.Robinson &amp; W.Moore)

Whose hair styles are out of this world
Whether it's straight or be fond of it's curls
My Baby My Baby My Baby ... hey hey hey
My Baby, Baby pretty Baby

Hair soft like a baby lamband I love to run my fingers through it.
I hope she digs me the way I am, cause if I have to change.
You know I'm gonna do it for my baby,
(I'm gonna do it for my baby)

Personality containing more gold,there is no bank in this world could hold.
My Baby, My Baby, My Baby, hey hey hey
My Baby, Baby, pretty Baby

Enough gold in her personality, to set Ft.Knox to shame.
This gold girl has proved to me,Yet no guy could try
To stake his claim on my baby.

(My baby) she's cute as can be (my baby) this girl's got a hold on me
(My baby) has a kiss so sweet, she knocks me off my feet,
She makes my life complete

Oh yeah, she's my baby
Oh yeah, she's my baby
And I love her soooooo
Yeah, I love my baby sooooo

My baby, she's cute as can be, my baby, this girl's got a hold on me
My baby, has a kiss so sweet, she knocks me off my feet,
She makes my life complete

Who has my mind in a kind of haze,Who has me walkin' around in a daze.
My Baby, My Baby, My Baby, hey hey hey
My Baby, Baby, pretty Baby

She gives me a feelin I can't explain,She sets my soul on fire.
But I don't feel hurt and I don't feel pain.
All I feel is strong desire for my baby,

Oh yeah my baby, that personality to satisfy me
Woo, that's my baby, My baby, My baby
