(One last kiss, one last kiss, give me one last kiss)

Oh one last kiss, oh baby one last kiss
It never felt like this, oh baby not like this
You know I need your love, oh oh oh give me one last kiss

Oh one more time, oh baby one more time
You made me feel  so fine, oh baby so so fine
You know I need your love, oh oh oh give me one last kiss

Darling it isn't right why must we say goodnight
Don't let me go like this
Baby I need you, so what if I have to
Go, just give me one last kiss

Oh one last kiss, oh baby one last kiss
It never felt like this, oh baby not like this
You know I need your love, oh oh oh give me one last kiss

Darling it isn't right why must we say goodnight
Don't let me go like this
Baby I need you, so what if I have to
Go, just give me one last kiss

Oh one last kiss, oh baby one last kiss
It never felt like this, oh baby not like this
You know I need your love, oh oh oh give me one last kiss

Oh oh oh give me one last kiss (just one last kiss)
