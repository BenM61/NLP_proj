No i was just saying that I've said a couple of funny things today
I don't know I was on the phone today and I said that whoever I was talking to 
that thought it was funny.
I'm not a very funny person so i get excited if anybody laughs other than me.

It blew my mind in to a million pieces
Pushed You aside
And still You got my back 
(Chapter 1, Page 1)
This is the part where I got weak
Fell in too deep
Every day and night got
Caught up in the hype
Started getting rough but
'Cause you showed me love I'm gonna...

Bounce, bounce back
Shake it off, get right on track
I'm moving on
Gotta put it in the past
Bounce, bounce back
Snap your fingers and just like that
I let it go
Gotta let it fade to black
Like a river
Cry all my tears
I have to swim through it
Dry it off, I'm outta here
Bounce, bounce back
Shake it off, I'm right on track
I'll be moving on

Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce back 
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce back 

Another day, still playas out to run game
Trying to make me flow
To places I don't roll
(Chapter two, page two)
Happening again
Like deja  vu
But it's brand new
Testing my faith
I won't make the same mistakes
So Playa' drop the drama
I Flipped the script and Now I'm gonna

Bounce, bounce back
Shake it off, get right on track
I'm moving on
Gotta put it in the past
Bounce, bounce back
Snap your fingers and just like that
I let it go
Gotta let it fade to black
Like a river
Cry all my tears
I have to swim through it
Dry it off, I'm outta here
Bounce, bounce back
Shake it off, I'm right on track
I'll be moving on

Yo, You've been down since the day I've found You
There ain't no way that I can do without You
It's off the chain the way I feel about You
I know I feel astray believe me when I say
This time, this time
I'm gonna be strong
This time, I'm gonna hold on
All this time, I'm gonna, when you forgive a wrong
I'm leaving it alone
Gonna be bounce, bounce, bounce, bouncing on

Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce back 
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce back 
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce back 
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce back 

Bounce, bounce back
Shake it off, get right on track
I'm moving on
Gotta put it in the past
Bounce, bounce back
Snap your fingers and just like that
I let it go
Gotta let it fade to black
Like a river
Cry all my tears
I have to swim through it
Dry it off, I'm outta here
Bounce, bounce back
Shake it off, I'm right on track
I'll be moving on
