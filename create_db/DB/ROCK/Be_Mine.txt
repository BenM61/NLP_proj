From the very first moment I saw you
That's when I knew 
All the dreams I held in my heart
Had suddenly come true
Knock me over stone cold sober
Not a thing I could say I did
'Cause baby when I'm walking with you now
My eyes are so wide
Like you reached right into my head
And turned on the light inside
Turning on the light
Inside my mind hey

Come on baby it's alright
Sunday, Monday, day or night
Written blue on white it's plain to see
Be mine, be mine
That rainy shiny night or day
What's the difference anyway
Honey till your heart belongs to me

If I had some influence girl
With the powers that be
I'd have them fire that arrow at you
Like they fired it right at me
And maybe when your heart and soul are burning you might see 
That every time I'm talking with you
It's always over too soon
That everyday feels so incomplete
Till you walk into the room?
Say the word now girl
I'll jump that moon hey

Come on baby it's okay
Rainy shiny night or day
There's nothing in the way now
Don't you see
Be mine, be mine
Winter summer day or night
Centigrade or Fahrenheit
Baby till your heart belongs to me
Be mine, be mine
Thursday Friday short or long
When you got a love so strong
How can it be wrong now mercy me
Be mine, be mine
Jumpin' Jesus holy cow!
What's the difference anyhow
Baby till your heart belongs to me

(My body's on fire, now my heart is on fire)
(My body's on fire, now my heart is on fire)
(My body's on fire, now I'm losing my sanity)
Be mine, be mine
(On fire, now my heart is on fire now my body's on fire now my heart is on fire)
(My body's on fire, now I'm losing my sanity)
Be mine, be mine
(My body's on fire, now my heart is on fire)
(My body's on fire, now my heart is on fire)
(My body's on fire,  now I'm losing my sanity)
Be mine, be mine
