Yesterday seems like so long ago
This space I'm in, reminds me so
Of the times, I use to rip and run
Shootin' my guns and out for fun

As time passed by, I changed my point of view
Started to search for someone like you
You made me feel so much love from the heart
Enough to know we'll never part

I wanna be with you
That's all I want to do
I wanna be with you
That's all I want to do
I wanna be with you

Look at you, like someone from a dream
You came to me, in time of need
You are the best, You're different from the rest
You take the cake, for goodness sake

I take you out, to prove that it's true
The greatest love I ever knew
Is in my arms, for more than just a night
'Cause baby now, you are my life

I wanna be with you
That's all I want to do
I wanna be with you
That's all I want to do
I wanna be with you
