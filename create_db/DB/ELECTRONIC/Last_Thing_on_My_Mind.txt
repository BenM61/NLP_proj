There was something in your voice
That was telling me don't be too sure
Arousing my suspicions
I have never felt before
I thought we had it made
I thought you'd never go away

But now you're suddenly like a stranger
And you're leaving our love behind
Of all the things I was ever planning for
This was the last thing on my mind

When I looked into your eyes
There was something you weren't telling me
But in my confusion
I just couldn't see
If there was any doubt
I thought that we would work it out

But now you're suddenly like a stranger
And you're leaving our love behind
Of all the things I was ever planning for
This was the last thing on my mind

This was the last thing on my mind

There was something in your voice
That was telling me don't be too sure
Arousing my suspicions
I have never felt before
I thought we had it made
I thought you'd never go away

But now you're suddenly like a stranger
And you're leaving our love behind
Of all the things I was ever planning for
This was the last thing on my mind
