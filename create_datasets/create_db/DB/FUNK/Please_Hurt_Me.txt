If you gotta hurt somebody, please hurt me
And if you gotta break a heart, then please break mine
I won't cry if you deceive me
I'll take it with a smile
I know someday you will leave me
But at least I'll have you for a while
So darlin', if you gotta hurt somebody, please hurt me
And if I have to be a plaything, that's what I'll be
Please hurt me, oh please hurt me
Come on and please hurt me
Why don't you please hurt me
