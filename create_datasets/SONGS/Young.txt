Ay (ay) I'm really out here my nigga (my nigga)
No responsibilities
F*ck the consequences
You can't tell me anything
Nah, never ask permission (nope, no)
Only ask forgiveness (yep, yep)
God is my witness (woop, woop)
Mama say I'm oblivious, daddy think I'm oblivious
Driftin' into oblivion
Buddy back on his bullshit again (ooh, I'm tellin')
Oh how I wish I was a kid again
Got a hard time with listenin'
Same problem with discipline
Still gotta get my dividends
It's so much adrenaline
Head is spinnin', I know I'ma sin again

Betta when ya young

It's a fine line between love and hate, ya see
Came way too late, and baby I'm on it
Yeah, it's a fine line between love and hate, ya see
Came way too late, and baby I'm on it
Can't worry 'bout what another nigga think
Now that's liberation, and baby I want it
Baby I want it
Can't worry 'bout what another nigga think
Now that's liberation, and baby I want it
(Lemme hit, lemme hit, lemme hit it once)
