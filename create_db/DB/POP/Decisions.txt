Don't just go from one nest to the next
Mama said to me
It's not where you go or where you left
It's the flying in-between
She said be sure to touch the sky
Don't put your dreams up on a shelf
Right now you're lost inside his eyes
I made the same myself, oooh

Am I in love?
Am I too young?
I know my life has just begun
Does he set me free?
Or put me in chains?
When did my life get rearranged
Do I hold on? Do I let go?
I know I can't escape tomorrow
Do I live for him? Or live for today?
Suddenly the sky looks far away

I can see the wheels turn in his mind
The way he looks at me
He says our kids will have my eyes
And what a mother I would be
Does this all have to move so fast
Can't I just take it day by day?
Am I building something that will last?
Or am I just running away?

Do I want to go from being
Somebody's daughter to
Somebody's wife to
Somebody's mother
I need my own life

I though my mother's life turned out as planned
But I never knew
Now that I'm grown I understand
All the things she longed to do
I've got to make it on my own
But I just can't leave him behind
So do I risk being alone
What is it I'm trying to find?

Am I in love? Am I too young?
I know my life has just begun
Does he set me free, or put me in chains?
When did my life get rearranged?
Do I hold on, do I let go?
I know I can't escape tomorrow
Can I live for him and live for today?
Suddenly the sky looks far away (far away)
Suddenly the sky looks far away
Far away
