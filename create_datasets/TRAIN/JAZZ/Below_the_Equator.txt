The moon was high below the equator 
And you and I were so in love 
The sea was blue below the equator 
Our dreams were new and so was love 

We strolled where the Andes kiss the sky 
Through palms filled with silken moss 
'Twas there that we cried and kissed goodbye 
By the light of the Southern Cross 

My heart will stay below the equator 
Until the day we meet again...!
