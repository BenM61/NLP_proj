[Erick Sermon]
As I proceed to rock y'all and shock y'all
Cold clubbing, some might say I'm bugging
I'm the back lifted, checking out folts
I see girls tricking, looking for a victim
Yeah they spot me, but I'm the wrong nigga
Cause ain't nothing changed since days of golddigger
They walk right past me like I'm invincible
Don't trust em, the first principle

[Parrish Smith]
Yo pass that here and cheers, celebrate like the new year
Honies front to rear, party over here
So get your groove on as we move on bust the new song
Once again, it's on, pop the cham' dom
Busting those when we pull up in the chrome
Party til daylight, just like Stallone
Rollin with the players, sporting timbs and the gators
Cell and pagers, fat whips quick to blaze ya

[Erick Sermon]
I be cooling, doing my thing, I'm slight jig
Sometimes I be down low, like mr. big
The green-eyed bandit, what? yea is he
The dark skin packs a mack-10 who gets busy?
I stay tight, keep the vibe right
I could pull a rampage and wild for da night
I'm lethal, I still do it for my people
I break it down for em, it's hard to ignore em

[Parrish Smith]
The time is right, and tonight's the night, we in the hype
We got my game type shorties excited, I'm feeling nice
We roll the dice, shot of vodka and ice
People on the dance floor, doing it right
Cristal for the profile, money spenders and pretenders
And v.i.p. rolling with the winners
You know how it go, Heineken's and the mo'
The pen and the pad and a dime piece to go
