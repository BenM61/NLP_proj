I've had a long day, I've been 
walking on, hands in pockets
Wishing on stars that I can't see
I watch all you city dreamers
left hometown believers
Looking down at the ground like me

We're all lonely people, lonely people, alone
Going in circles, going wherever the wind blows and it blows

But I'm lighting matches
Making a shelter for a flame til' fire catches
Stay in the dark another day (I wanna know)
Will it all get better (are we alone?)
Or are we lost together

Nah-nana-nah-nah-nana-nah
Are we lost together
Nah-nana-nah-nah-nana-nah
Are we lost together

So I lift my eyes up
let conversation lie on
It feels like I've no room for time
Tell me which piece of you is missing
We all got pasts, we fix them
It's just the catch of being alive

We're all lonely people, lonely people, alone
Going in circles, going wherever the wind blows and it blows

But I'm lighting matches
Making a shelter for a flame til' fire catches
Stay in the dark another day (I wanna know)
Will it all get better (are we alone?)
Or are we lost together

Nah-nana-nah-nah-nana-nah
Are we lost together
Nah-nana-nah-nah-nana-nah
Are we lost together

And I-I-I-I won't stand down
And I-I-I-I won't let it burn down
Can't make this puzzle with a piece that doesn't fit
There must be something more than this

So I'm lighting matches
Making a shelter for a flame til' fire catches
Stay in the dark another day (I wanna know)
Will it all get better (are we alone?)
Or are we lost together

Nah-nana-nah-nah-nana-nah
Are we lost together
Nah-nana-nah-nah-nana-nah
Are we lost together
