After years of waiting
Nothing came
As your life flashed before your eyes
You realize

I'm a reasonable man
Get off, get off, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case
Get off my case

After years of waiting
After years of waiting nothing came
And you realize you're looking
Looking in the wrong place

I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case 
Get off my case 
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case
Get off my case
Get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case
Get off my case
Get off my case

After years of waiting
You're a reasonable man
Get off my case
Get off my case
Get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case 
Get off my case
Get off my case

I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case
Get off my case
Get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case 
Get off my case
Get off my case
