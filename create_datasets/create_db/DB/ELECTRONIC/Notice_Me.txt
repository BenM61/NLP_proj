(If dreams should come true)
Dreams should come true
(Then you will be mine)
Then you will be mine
You are for me and me for you
Only thing I want you to do

I watch you day by day
But you do not know I exist
I try to tell you my name, baby
But the words just seem to resist

(Words)
To say that I want you for me
(A love to share)
To share for eternity
(Friends)
To share all our secrets and dreams
To solve our problems together

If you'd notice me
Won't you notice me
Baby, notice me
Won't you notice me

I walk by where you work everyday
Hoping you'd glance my way
A smile would break out from me to you
Conversation would make its way

(Words)
To say that I want you for me
(A love to share)
To share for eternity
(Friends)
To share all our secrets and dreams
To solve our problems together

If you'd notice me
Won't you notice me
Baby, notice me
Won't you notice me

Yeah
That's right baby
Won't you notice me
Like I notice you

Notice me, notice me, notice me
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-notice me, baby

Don't you see, I want you to want me
Why can't we be together?
Don't you see, I want you to want me too
Why can't we be forever?

If dreams do come true
Then you will be mine
You are for me and me for you
The only thing I want you to do

Is to notice me
Won't you notice me
I want you to notice me
Won't you notice me

Baby, notice me
Won't you notice me
Baby, notice me
Won't you notice me
