When the night falls, The big moon's gonna rise
You can look right up, See it, In the sky
Makes me feel like I'm gonna blow a fuse
I start to shiver and shake with a strange kind of blues

... But I like it

I see it now the moon is high above
It's got a hold on me, But I just can't get enough
Big, round, black and white, I feel the pull, I see the light
Big bad moon's looking down on me tonight

... But I like it

When the moon comes, Got nowhere to hide
I can turn your head around, Like it turns the tide
Man, woman, boy, child, Make you feel like you were born wild
The big bad moon's looking down on me tonight

... But I like it
... I like it

Talkin' 'bout big bad moon
Ooh yeah big bad moon
Talkin' 'bout big bad moon
Ooh yeah...
