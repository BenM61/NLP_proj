Duplicated man, inside, double tied
Prisoner, he's back to back, face to face
Mirrored shadows always changing place
Separated man himself he divides
Opposite needs he can't see where to hide
A single double side - Jekyll and Hyde
This man was good, he was calm
He'd never do any harm
Gentle soul as you may see
As caring as he could be

Now who's outside, inside, Jekyll and Hyde
Now who's outside, inside, Jekyll and Hyde

Deep down inside he hides
A twist that we maybe missed
Confusion and nasty trick of fate
Might be the break
Don't find yourself too late
Now who's outside, inside, Jekyll and Hyde
This man acid raving beast
His eyes, his rage unleash
He tears apart all at hand
Back to the wall is his stand

Now who's outside, inside, Jekyll and Hyde
Now who's outside, inside, Jekyll and Hyde

Duplicated man, inside, double tied
Prisoner, he's back to back, face to face
Mirrored shadows always changing place
Separated man himself he divides
Opposite needs he can't see where to hide
A single double side - Jekyll and Hyde
This man unsteady and unsure
Where did he go before
Slightly afraid you may see
Forgetting who you may be

Now who's outside, inside, Jekyll and Hyde
Now who's outside, inside, Jekyll and Hyde
