[Chorus]
There's ants in the kitchen baby
Thought I'd let you know
There's ants in the kitchen
Thought I'd let you know

There's two right there
Makin' off with the stereo

There's bugs in the compressor honey
That's why the truck won't go
There's bugs in the compressor honey
That's why the truck won't go

Stuck in Indiana
With a bug in my banana

[Chorus]
