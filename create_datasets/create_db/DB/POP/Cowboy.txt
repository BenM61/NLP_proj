Lookin' for a boy, a real boy, strong boy
Searchin' for a boy, a tough boy, rough boy
I just love the smell of his leather skin
Just love to feel the muscles in his jeans

Give me a cow, give me a boy, give me a cowboy
I'm looking, I'm searching for someone (who won't go wicked to me)
Where no schoolboy Apaches come knocking
Comb your hair, good looking, we're meant to go rocking

Searching for a boy, a real boy, strong boy
I want to be squeezed by a pair of boots
I want to get teased by Westcoast boots
Give me a cow, give me a boy, give me a cowboy

I'm looking, I'm searching for someone (who won't go wicked to me)
Where no schoolboy Apaches come knocking
I want to be jacked by a leather suit freak
Loves to kid nance, at least for a week

I'm looking, I'm searching for a real boy - give me a cowboy
Give me a cow, give me a boy, give me a cowboy
I'm coming to hunt you down, Geronimo
I'm sure I can't stand this world much longer

Give me a cow, give me a boy, give me, give me a cowboy
I'm coming to hunt you down, Geronimo (hear the wolf attack in the canyon)
I'm sure I can't stand this world much longer
