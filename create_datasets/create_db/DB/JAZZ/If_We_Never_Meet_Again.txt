If we never meet again, I'll have a rose to remember
The snows of December will bring you back to me
If we never meet again, I'll fall asleep in the flowers
And dream of the hours we spent in ecstasy

The leaves in the fall will wreak all the beauty I found in your eyes
The birds in the spring when they sing, will tell me that love never dies
If we never meet again, as sure as heaven above you
Forever I'll love you if we never meet again
