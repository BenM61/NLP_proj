Keep your promise to me, o hi ibh o
Take greetings from me, hu il oro,

Take greetings from me 
Over to Harris 
To John Campbell, 
My brown haired sweetheart
 
To John Campbell, 
My brown haired sweetheart  
Hunter of goose, 
Seal and swan 
 
Hunter of goose, 
Seal and swan 
Of leaping trout, 
Of bellowing deer. 
 
Wet is the night 
Tonight, and cold, 
If the MacNeills 
Have to put to sea 
 
If the MacNeills 
Have put to sea - 
Men of high sails 
And swift of ships 
 
Men of high sails 
And swift ships, 
And of banners 
Blue and green
 
And of banners 
Blue and green  
No left hander 
Could take her rudder from you.
