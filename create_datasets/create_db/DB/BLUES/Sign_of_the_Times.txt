Wild palms in the hinterland
Stretches of yellow sand
A blue bird trapped in my hand
It's hard to understand

It must be a sign of the times, times
It must be a sign of the time
Time, time, time, time

My friend can't talk no more
He just gazes at his kitchen floor
Building a boat that will never float
Packing it with animals and bags of oats

Must be, yes, a sign of the times, times
It must be a sign of the times
Sign of the times

Oh, give me a sign, oh, what is the sign?
Oh, what is their line? Oh, a sign, a sign
Any sign, any line, any time
Any sigh, any lie, not mine, not mine

I'm building, what am I building?
I'm working, why am I working?
My hands are clean and never dirty
I wear something and it hurts me

Must be my sign of the times
Must be, yes, my sign of the times
Sign of the times

Must be, give me a sign
Oh, any sign, oh, any sign
Oh, any line, any sign, any rhyme
Any time, not mine, it's not mine

It's not mine, it's not mine
It's not mine, it's not mine

My mother, she knows
I really think she knows
Taken to painting her toes
Taken to wear those odd clothes

Must be a sign of the times, times
Must be a sign of the times, times
Sign of the times

So you can help me
Let me know you can help me
Make it a positive sign
'Cause this face is not really mine

Must be a sign of my mind, mind, mind, mind
Must be a sign of the times
Sign of the time

A sign of the times
My face is not mine
My face is not mine
