I feel alone... i feel like i could die
I feel alone... i feel like i could die... tonight, yeah yeah
Carry on, carry on, yeah

Don't feel ashamed... don't feel ashamed
I rather it be this way
You're not to blame... you're not to blame
Don't feel ashamed

I'm getting close... get away
To the other side, yeah
Just close the door... down on me
I'll leave the past behind me
Can you see my pride
It's only one step away from
Freedom... freedom

I feel i can fly anywhere... anywhere... with anyone... with anyone... with anyone

Don't feel ashamed... don't feel ashamed
I rather it be this way
You're not to blame... you're not to blame
Don't feel ashamed

I want you baby... so don't you feel ashamed!
I want you baby... so don't you feel ashamed!
