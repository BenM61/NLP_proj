How soft a whisper can get
When you're walking through a crowded space
I hear every word that you said
I remember that everyday
I get a little bit closer to you, to you

How long an hour can take
When you're staring into open space
When I feel I'm slipping further away
I remember that everyday
I get a little bit closer to you, to you

These are the days that I won't get back
Won't hear you cry or hear you laugh
When it's quiet I don't hear a thing
I can always hear you breathe

You know there's nowhere else that I've wanted to be
But be there when you need me
I'm sorry too but don't give up on me
And just remember that when you went to sleep
I got a little bit closer to you, closer to you, closer to you

Oh, closer, closer to you
Little bit closer, closer to you
I got closer to you
