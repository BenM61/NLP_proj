Drove downtown in the rain,
Nine-thirty on a Tuesday night,
Just to check out the late night,
Record shop.

Call it impulsive,
Call it compulsive,
Call it insane.
But when I'm surrounded I just can't, stop.

It's a matter of instincts,
A matter of conditioning,
A matter of fact.
You can call me Pavlov's dog.

Ring a bell and I salivate,
How'd you like that?

[Chorus]
Lyin' in bed,
Just like Brian Wilson did,

I'll be out in the sandbox,
Wondering where the hell all the

Playing my guitar and
Building castles in the sun and
Singing "Fun, Fun, Fun"

[Chorus]

I had a dream
that I was three hundred pounds
And though I was very heavy

I floated 'til I couldn't see the ground
I floated 'til I couldn't see the ground
Somebody help me,
I couldn't see the ground

Somebody help me because I'm

[Chorus]

Drove downtown in the rain
Nine-thirty on a Tuesday night,
Just to check out the late-night
Record shop.

Call it impulsive
You can call it compulsive,
You can call it insane;
But when I'm surrounded
I just can't stop.
