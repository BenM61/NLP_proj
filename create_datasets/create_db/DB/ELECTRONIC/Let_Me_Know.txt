You come when you want
You take what you need and then you're off
Gone with the wind
I wonder when this will end
When will you stay with me for more than a day
Is there a chance
Or am I asking for a little bit too much again
Is there are a ray of hope
Is it impossible
Don't leave me hanging on when

All you have to do is let me know
Let me know what's going on inside of your heart
All you have to do is let me know
Let me know if I should start changing my life
Changing my life

Yes I'm to blame 
Cause I let you have it your way
Is it too late
Down to the road to heartache
To tell you the truth
Baby it's left up to you
What will it be
Just the say the word
And I'll be yours for eternity
Is there a ray of hope
Give me a yes or no
Don't leave me hanging on when

All you have to do is let me know
Let me know what's going on inside of your heart
All you have to do is let me know
Let me know if I should start changing my life
Changing my life

So many nights
I sat alone up and I've cried
I'm real but I did
So many tears
Waiting for you
Not knowing what else to do
But never again, ohh noooo

Maybe I'm asking for a little bit too much again
I just need a ray of hope
If it's impossible
don't leave me hanging on, when something's wrong

Cause all you have to do is let me know
Let me know what's going on inside of your heart
All you have to do is let me know
Let me know if I should start changing my life
Changing my life (repeat)
