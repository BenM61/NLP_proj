Madonna
Evita
Latin Chant

Respice, quaesumus, Domine
Famulam tuam Evita
In infirmitate
Et animam refove, quam creasti
Ut castigationibus emendata
Se tua sentiat medicina salvatam
Per Christum, Dominuum
Qui vivit et regnat
Per omnia saecula saeculorum
Amen

Look with favor, we beseech Thee, Oh Lord
Upon Thy handmaid Evita
In her weakness
And refresh the soul which Thou hast created
That being corrected by Thy chastisement
She may find herself cured by Thy healing
Through Christ, Our Lord
Who lives and reigns
Forever and ever
Amen
