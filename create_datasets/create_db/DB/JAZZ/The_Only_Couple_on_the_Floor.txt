The band played songs from years ago,
There wasn't one we didn't know,
The singer's voice was soft and low,
The lights came on, we didn't know

I held your body close to mine,
Your eyes were closed and so were mine.
I fell in love with you once more,
Just like a million times before.

Then I awoke, I was alone, my dreams like you have come and gone.
Tonight I'll hold you one more time, and dream your eyes are closed like mine.
