The clock on the wall keeps ticking away
Night and day, it's ticking away
The clock on the wall, like my heart, is saying 
I love you, I love you, I love you
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock

Seems that sixty seconds got together 
And they decided to become a minute
Sixty minutes got together
And they decided to become an hour
Twenty-four hours kept ticking away
And they all voted to call it a day
By calling it a day, there wasn't time to say
How much I love you

Then seven days, they got together and decided to become a week
As they grew and grew, then fifty-two weeks decided to become a year
(I love you, dear)

For sixty seconds every minute, sixty minutes every hour
Every hour, every day, every day, every week
Every week in every year
All I do is dream of you my dear

For sixty seconds every minute, sixty minutes every hour
Every hour, every day, every day, every week
Every week in every year
All I do is dream of you

Sixty seconds, sixty minutes, every day of every year
I love you
