Broken buildings watching over flooded streets where nothing moves
Shelters for the vultures hardly keeping daylight out
Marble stained with rust, faded paintings on the walls
Beaten towers crumble, haunted only by the wind

I will live forever
No angels left to hold me
I will be the final man

Picking up the given challenge of the fallen gargoyle angels
Headed on collision course with martyrs tied as fenders
Driving like a mad dog going faster than a bullet
Pulled by gravitation from a million tons of stone

Human insects lived here crawling through the underground
Beehive built in stainless, a cathedral for the slaves
Spineless cowards guided by ideals they couldn't grasp
Giving up their freedom in the hope of being chosen

I will live forever
No angels left to hold me
I will be the final man

In the twilight grows the shadow's hollow hands that tries to catch me
Omens can not stop me because all the prophets died
Like the ancient temples their monuments survived them
Speeding through the ruins I left their bridges burning

I will live forever
No angels left to hold me
I will be the final man
