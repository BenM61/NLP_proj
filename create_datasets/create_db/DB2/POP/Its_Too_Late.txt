I remember when I told you
That I tried in every way
To hold you and kiss you and love you and keep you till my dying day
You just laughed
And said you found somebody new
And you didn't need all the things I could do

Now you found out that your new love
Isn't true like he should be
You say that you're gonna forget him and you're gonna come back to me
Well things have changed
And I've found me somebody new
Someone to make me forget about you
And I'm telling you

That it's too late to say you're sorry
It's too late to say you're mine
I have found myself a new love
And I'm going to make her mine
It's too late
It's too late

Many days I tried to call you
Many nights I spent alone
Everyone knew that I loved you but you had a love of your own
But now that it's gone
You think you can come back to me
But I'm not the same fool that I used to be
And you're gonna see
That it's too late to say you're sorry
It's too late to say you're mine
I have found myself a new love
And I'm going to make her mine
It's too late
It's too late
To say you're mine

It's too late to say you're sorry
It's too late to say you're mine
I have found myself a new love
And I'm going to make her mine

It's too late to say you're sorry
It's too late to say you're mine
I have found myself a new love
And I'm going to make her mine
