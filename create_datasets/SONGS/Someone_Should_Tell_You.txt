You call me up, in tears again
I come over
Your only friend
Put my arms around you
To stop this lonely night
You ask me to stay
I don't think it's right

When you tell me you're in love with him
Don't you know that really caves me in
And I'm not that strong

Someone should tell you
How much I love you
'cause I really do
Wish I could hold you
The way that I want to
'cause no one, can love you, like I do

You're everything, that I ever dreamed
You're the only one
The only one for me
So we talk all night
But in my head
Three little words, that I never said

You say you don't know what you'd do without me
Don't you know that this is killing me
And I'm not that strong

Someone should tell you
How much I love you
'cause I really do
Wish I could hold you
The way that I want to
'cause no one, can love you, like I do

When you tell me you're in love with him
Don't you know that really caves me in
And I'm not that strong
No I'm not that strong

Someone should tell you
How much I love you
'cause I really do
Wish I could hold you
The way that I want to
'cause no one, can love you, like I do
