Our love will stand the test of time
Sweeter than the honey from the bees
When you're not here, a song won't rhyme
And the birds won't sing in the trees

You can make the sun come out
Without you the sky is grey
And love and laughter is what you're about
So don't you ever go away

Close to perfection
Close to perfection
We have reached a new direction
On our way to affection

Every day can fill like spring
'Cause you have the power to make me glow
Suddenly the bells start to ring
Life becomes a Broadway show

You make music fill the air
Like a symphony of love
I can see rainbows everywhere
Lighting up the sky above

Close to perfection
Close to perfection
We have reached a new direction
On our way to affection

There's a new excitement around
Every time I see you smile
An experience of silent sound
That's with me all the while

You have filled an empty space
Showing me that you care
It's a feeling I won't replace
A lifetime you and I can share

Close to perfection
Close to perfection
We have reached a new direction
On our way to affection

Close to perfection (Closer, closer to perfection)
Close to perfection
We have reached a new direction
On our way to affection

Close to perfection (Closer, closer to perfection)
Close to perfection
We have reached a new direction
On our way to affection
