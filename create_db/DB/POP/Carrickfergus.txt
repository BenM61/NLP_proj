(traditional).

I wish I was in carrickfergus
Only for nights in ballygrand
I would swim over the deepest ocean
Just to see my love before I die
But the sea is wide and I cannot swim over
Nor have I wings so I could fly
I wish I could meet a handsome boatman
To carry me over my love and I
In kilkenny it is reported
On marble stones as black as ink
With gold and silver I did support her
But i&acute;ll sing no more till i&acute;ve had a drink
Well i&acute;m drunk today and i&acute;m seldom sober
A handsome rover from town to town
But I am sick now my days are numbered
Come all you young men and lay me down
Come all you young men and lay me down
