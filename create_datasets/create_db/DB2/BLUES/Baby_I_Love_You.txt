If you want my love, baby
If you really do
Don't be afraid, baby
Just ask and ooh, I'm gonna give it to you

Though I do declare, I want to see you with it
Stretch out your arms little boy
You're gonna get it
'Cause I love you
Baby, baby, baby I love you
Ain't no doubt about , I love you
Baby, baby, baby I love you
I love you, I love you, Baby I love you

Some day, you might wanna run away
Leave me sitting here, crying
But if it's all the same to you baby
I'm gonna stop you from saying goodbye
Because I love you, baby I love you, I love you
I love you baby

Some day you might wanna run away
Leave me here, sitting and crying
But if it's all the same to you baby
I'm gonna stop you from saying goodbye
Baby I love you, baby I need you, gotta have you baby, tell you darling
Don't let your neighbors tell you that I don't want you
Don't let your low down friends tell you I don't need you
Ooh, baby I love you. I got to have you
Baby, baby I love you
