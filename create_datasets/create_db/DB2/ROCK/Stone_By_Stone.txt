You always hear the shouts
From my battalion
I send toy soldiers out to
Help me stand
And when I see you hide
Behind these curtain folds
I cross the room to turn the
Lights down low...

On common ground
We'll build our castle walls
We'll build them stone by stone
And how
With more and more
You know it won't take long
Where it burned orange
Let it burn gold...

I wouldn't like to learn
A lesson everyday
Good times, bad times
It's just the price to pay
But given half the chance
Of turning back the tide
I'll stay at home and keep
My boys in line...

On common ground
We'll build our castle walls
We'll build them stone by stone
And how
With more and more
You know it won't take long
Where it burned orange
Let it burn gold...

And given half the chance
To turn the hands of time
I'm always the bridesmaid
Couldn't live with myself
If I tried to be the bride...

On common ground
We'll build our castle walls
We'll build them stone by stone
With more and more
You know it won't take long
Where it burned orange
Let it burn gold...
