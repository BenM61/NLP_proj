Mr. Meadowlark, we've got an awful lot of serenadin' to do
Mr. Meadowlark, I'm just a city slicker and I'm countin' on you
She's got a country guy who whistles, my whistle's so thin
So when I begin that's where you come in

Mr. Meadowlark, if you should cop a gander when I'm kissin' my chick
Needless to remark, I hope you'll have the decency to exit but quick
If Mrs. M. thinks you're out steppin', I'll make it alright
Mr. Meadowlark, meet me in the dark tonight!
