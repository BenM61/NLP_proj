Babygirl, alright
I gotta find me a girl
Whoa oh
Alright now

Sunshine
From the first time that we met
Helpless
You took my heart I must confess
Deep in your eyes
There seemed to be a look that said
Hello, is it me you're searching for

Suddenly my sunshine turn to rain
I dunno if it'll ever come back again
That's what you are sunshine and rain
You didn't say you had a man
That never belonged within your plans
And it hurts so bad
Someone tell me

Why are all the good girls, taken everytime
And why do I keep falling for
Someone else's dime
Everytime I says Hello
Then they say Goodbye
So why are all you good girls
Taken everytime
Taken everytime

Dancing
With your body close to mine
Then you kiss my lips girl
Girl I thought it was a sign
I want you forever
But good intentions never win
I've got that feeling
Tonight I'll be alone again

Suddenly my sunshine turned to rain
I dunno if it'll ever come back again
That's what you are sunshine and rain
You didn't say you had a man
That never belonged within your plans
And it hurts so bad
Someone tell me

Why are all the good girls, taken everytime
And why do I keep falling for
Someone else's dime
Everytime I says Hello
Then they say Goodbye
So why are all you good girls
Taken everytime

Why are all the good girls, taken everytime (somebody tell me)
And why do I keep fallin for
Someone else's dime
Everytime I says Hello (hello)
Then they say Goodbye (please baby)
So why are all you good girls (why)
Taken everytime

Whoa Ooohh
I gotta believe
There's a Rony for me
Somewhere in this world
I'm not gonna stop
Gonna search till I drop
Till I find that girl
I gotta believe
There's an rony for me
Somewhere in this world
I'm not gonna stop
Gonna search till I drop
Till I find that girl

Why are all the good girls
Taken everytime
And why do I keep falling for
Someone else's dime
Everytime I says hello
Then they say Goodbye
So why are all you good girls
Taken everytime

Why are all the good girls
Taken everytime
And why do I keep falling for
Someone else's dime
Everytime I says hello
Then they say Goodbye
So why are all you good girls
