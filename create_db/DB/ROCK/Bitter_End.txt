Baby, come down
I'll be friend
Show you around
'Til the bitter end

You would wake up in the early morning sun
Pray to God that you are not the only one
Who has to fight it when the world knocks on your door
Who hasn't worked out what it is you're fighting for

So, baby, come down
I'll be friend
Show you around
'Til the bitter end

Give me something I can really understand
Paint a picture where the world lies in my hand
Make it simple, make it starting from today
You know I wouldn't want it any other way

So, baby, come down
I'll be friend
Show you around
'Til the bitter end

I tried to find someone who cares
It never gets you anywhere

Baby, come down
I'll be friend
Show you around
'Til the bitter end

Baby, come down
I'll be friend
Show you around
'Til the bitter end
