This old heart
Can't stand much more
This old heart
Can't stand much more

Though I heard it
I won't turn you, oh, no

This old heart
Can't bear this pain
This old heart
Can't bear this pain

If you love me
You won't hurt me
And refrain

Took my love
And now you're gone
Took my heart
And gone on home

I know, pretty baby
That you won't be true
And I don't care what you do

This old heart
Can't bear this pain
This old heart
Can't bear this pain

If you love me
You won't hurt me
And refrain

Took my love
And now you're gone
Took my heart
And gone on home

I know, pretty baby
That you won't be true
And I don't care what you do

This old heart
Can't stand no more
This old heart
Can't stand no more

Though I heard it
I won't turn you, oh, no

Though I heard it
I won't turn you, oh, no
