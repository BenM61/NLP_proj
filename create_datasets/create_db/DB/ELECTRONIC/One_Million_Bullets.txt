Under the moonlight
Weathering with your warm embrace
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I feel so safe here
Baby we're worth the wait

Time after time
I drank from the poisoned wine
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Yeah, I picked the wrong kind
But baby you're alright

I got a feeling, I got a feeling
Danger is coming, a danger is coming

The war has been won here, the war has been won here, he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he

Under the moonlight, under your moonlit gaze
I know that I'd take one million bullets babe
Yeah, one million bullets can come my way
But I want you to know that, I'd take a million babe

How many will you take?

If you were the hero, yeah, I'd take a bullet for you (oh-oh-oh-oh)
So take me in your arms, take me for all I have (oh-oh-oh-oh)
'Cause I'd give my life for one of your belly laughs (oh-oh-oh-oh)
