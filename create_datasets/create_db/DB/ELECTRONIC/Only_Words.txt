Every day you put me down
Givin' me a world of lies and then
You try to run me round
And now I'm here all alone again
I told you this one million times
Darlin' all I need is just the truth
No charity or lies
But now I'm tired of believin' you

Baby everywhere I go
It's rain and tears coz I'm still needin' you
Don't give me any more excuses
I've heard them all before only words only words

So with or without you
Oh I know my heart will mend
I know it's not easy (to leave you)
But you told me lies (only words again)

I feel I'm slidin' down
Drownin' in a sea of memories
But I won't call you no
You had your way this time it's up to me

Baby everywhere I go
Rain and tears fall coz I'm still needin' you
Don't give me any more excuses
I've heard them all before


Don't you give me only words
