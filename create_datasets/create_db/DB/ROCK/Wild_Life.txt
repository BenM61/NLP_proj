Come on and live it
Ooh, yeah

Sitting home by yourself with the TV on
You know you got nothing better to do
And then all of a sudden get a feeling inside
There's a whole party waiting for you

You crawl out to the jungle late at night
Your friends they go real far
(They go real far)
Now you're searching for the time of your life
And you'll never, never know where you are

It's a wild life that's in your veins
You'll feel like an animal that's been uncaged
You live the wild life
(Wild life)
It's a wild, wild life, right

Come on and live it
Ooh, yeah

Now you're hanging with the pact out seeing the sights
Now everything's looking good to you
It's a fine line between fire and ice
But you're gonna break on through

You're crawling fast now with the wind in your hair
You know you can't get enough
(You can't get enough)
No matter what you see, no matter what you do
You know you'll never, never know where you are

It's a wild life that's in your veins
You'll feel like an animal that's been uncaged
You live the wild life
(Wild life)
It's a wild, wild life, right

So now you're in the jungle late at night
Your friends they go real far
(They go real far)
You'll be searching for the time of your life
But you'll never, never know where you are

It's a wild life, that's in your veins
You'll feel like an animal that's been uncaged
You live the wild life
(Wild life)
It's a wild, wild life

Wild, wild life
Wild, wild life
Wild, wild life
It's a wild, wild life
