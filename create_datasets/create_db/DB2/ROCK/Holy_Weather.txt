This is the final journey
To the edge of ourselves
This is the beginning of the end
Took her hand
And walked her through
Took her hand
And walked her into the blue
Into that blue

So we walked on water
And crossed the fields
Of burning sand
But the further we went,
The the more we became
What we couldn't understand
I was drifting further away
She was lost like a breeze
In a hurricane
A hurricane

You know I've got you
In my blood-stream
You know that no matter
How loud I scream,
I still hear your voice in my head

You are the fire burning solo
You are the wind
In between the snow
I can't escape you
I can't escape

Go back, go back
Find yourself a train track
It's not too late to go home
Passion is this weight
On my shoulders
Passion is this weight
On my shoulders
Passion is this weight
On my shoulders
Passion is this weight
On my shoulders

So why did you follow me
Into this den
When all the bluest stars
Paint your name
In a sky of black
You must go back

I told you that I've got you
In my blood-stream
I told you that no matter
How loud I scream,
I still hear your voice in my head

You are the fire burning solo
You are the wind
In between the snow
I can't escape you
I can't escape you, oh

(Passion is this weight
On my shoulders)
