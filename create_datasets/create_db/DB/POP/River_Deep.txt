When you were a young girl
Did you want a rag doll
The only doll you've ever owned
Now I'll love you just the way you loved that rag doll
Only now my love has grown

It gets stronger as the river flows
Deeper baby, heaven knows
Higher, as it goes

Do I love you, my oh my
River deep, mountain high, yeah, yeah, yeah
Do I love you, would I cry
Oh I love you baby, how I love you baby

When you were a young girl
Did you have a puppy
That always followed you around
Well I'm gonna be as faithful as that puppy
No I'll never never let you down

'cause it gets stronger as the river flows
It gets deeper baby, heaven knows
It gets higher, so much higher, as it goes

Do I love you, my oh my
River deep, mountain high, yeah, yeah, yeah
Do I love you, would I cry
Oh I love you baby, how I love you baby

I love you baby like a flower loves a spring
I love you baby like a wrong man likes to sin
I love you baby like a schoolboy likes his pie
And oh I love you baby, river deep, mountain high

Do I love you, my oh my
River deep, mountain high, yeah, yeah, yeah
Do I love you, would I cry
Oh I love you baby, how I love you baby
