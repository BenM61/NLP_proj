I went back, I went back to your love
And I felt so many wrongs
That I wasted on you by the crowd
And I called, you called me
And I whispered your name
I went home, we stared blank
To the pages I loved

Well, I just wanna compliment your soul
I just wanna compliment your soul
Yeah, I just wanna compliment

And I wasted tears, I let go
So many rights, so many nights
That I come and I go
I just wanna know, do you,
And I can't ever be shut out
You're meant to be the wrong gal
Tell it twice

Cause I just wanna compliment your soul
Yeah, I just wanna compliment your soul
I compliment your
I compliment your

Yeah, I just wanna compliment your soul
Yes, I just wanna compliment your soul
Cause I just wanna compliment your (soul)
I just wanna compliment
