If you are but a dream
I hope I never waken
It's more than I could bear
To find that I'm forsaken

If you're a fantasy
Then I'm content to be
In love with lovely you
And pray my dream comes true

I long to kiss you
But I would not dare
I'm so afraid
That you may vanish in the air

So, darling
If our romance should break up
I hope I never wake up
If you are but a dream

I long to kiss you
But I would not dare
I'm so afraid
That you may vanish in the air

So, darling
If our romance should break up
I hope I never wake up
If you are but a dream
