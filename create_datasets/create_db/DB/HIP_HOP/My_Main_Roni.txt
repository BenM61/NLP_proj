My main girl, ain't that some shit
I ain't with it 
Niggas ain't shit, bitches ain't either  
All that fallin in love and all that
It don't work, it ain't never work
Adam and Eve couldn't even true to each other
So how you expect me and another shawty
I ain't lyin I ain't lyin

I ain't gone lie
I admit I just wanted to f*ck some
Get cha, split cha, hit cha and trick you to suck some 
Love and leave ya, like Tina and Rick James
But I fell for your jazzy class and trick games
Your in the process, I'm just tryin to get cha naked 
Not slip the bullet see and plus that you should be respected 
Never neglected gave you my all and all 
I bought your jewelry, nails hairdos and all your draws 
I call and call, straight bug-a-booin for real  
That's when I knew this never imagine love for you was trill
Makin love was like heaven right here on your couch
Beatin and diggin each morning (smoke don't stop)
My wife, damn right and proud to say it 
My lady, I can trust I done finally made it
My main thang, my lil' shawty, my old lady
Took coversation wit my homies, this hoe crazy
This hoe think we be goin on trips and fuckin groupie hoes
And I be lyin when I say I'm at the studio
Listen'n to he said, she said so she went and cheated 
She be givin me head and him, too
Heard you be caken him and call'n him boo 
I want back my pink ice rings and Tim boots
You can get back all this bullshit you bought me 
Fooled me, had me think'n you was my shawty, shawty
Caught her fucked up, can't say shit so keep ya trap shut
Knowin ya wrong on my phone and I know when I tapped up

You was my main Roni
Got all your game from me 
But then you changed on me 
I, I, I never would have thought that you was cheatin on me

'Cause you got game from me
Shiny diamond rings from me
But then you changed on me
I, I, I never would have thought that you was cheatin on me

I know it was plain for me 
But now it's plain to see
You're not the dame for me
I, I, I never would have thought that you was cheatin on me

'Cause you put shame on me
You left me to hang Roni
Love'll never be the same for me
I, I never would have thought that you was cheatin on me

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Back in the day 
When I thought about us girl I thought about marriage
Me, you, new crib kids and a carriage
Thought everything was all good all gravy 
You was my Hope I was your Bo Brady
For real, I loveded you so much
My damn dick got hard think'n about your touch
You were sweeter than candy 
And had a pussy print that look like a midget man
Standin in your panties
Fine motherfucker thick thighs, boleggs
Thought you was a queen, hell yea I broke bread
For slow sex and more head than asprin 
Lately huff'n and puff'n, bus'n nuts gaspin 
For air, grabbin your hair, you booted over
Never reachin the bed legs spread on the sofa
Gave you my time and money that's all I had 
I ain't ask you for shit but you gave me crap
Yea I heard you was f*ck'n and suck'n my boy Dennis
(sean let me explain) wait a minute let me finish
While I be at the job work'n bus'n my ass
You be sneak'n and creep'n the street f*ck'n for cash
I can't believe this shit girl I loveded you 
Now I wish I wouldn't even fucked wit you 
You can use the phone you better call Tyrone
Pack your shit and be gone when I come back home

You was my main Roni
Got all your game from me 
But then you changed on me 
I, I, I never would have thought that you was cheatin on me

You was my main Roni
Got all your game from me 
But then you changed on me 
I, I, I never would have thought that you was cheatin on me
