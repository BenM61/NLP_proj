I've been trying, fixing the problem
You pressed the button
To launch yourself while I was outside

I heard a spark ignite
I saw a ball of light
I watched you lifting off
There could be no mistake
My hope and faith misplaced
I saw you lighting off

You pressed the button
To launch yourself , while I was outside
You left me standing
While you broke through the atmosphere

I guess you thought you'd start
A new clean sheet and heart
From when you lifted off
I watched you disappear
A ringing in my ear
From when you lifted off

You pressed the button
To launch yourself while I was outside
You left me stranded
While you broke through to other worlds

You left me stranded
While you broke through to other worlds

You pressed the button
To launch yourself while I was outside
You left me stranded
You launched yourself while I was outside

You pressed the button
To launch yourself while I was outside
You left me stranded
You launched yourself while I was outside
