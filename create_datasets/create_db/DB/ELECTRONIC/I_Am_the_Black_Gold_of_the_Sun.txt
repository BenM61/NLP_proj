I am the white side of the sun
follow the beat across the light
father of the one
I am the black gold of the sun
I am the black gold of the sun
I am the the dark side of the sun
Shadows that light up the day
Darkness shadow all the way
I am the black gold of the sun
I am the black gold of the sun

I am the light
I am the fire that brings around the sun
and set you free
so free (so free)

I am the black gold of the sun

To be who I wanna be
To go where I wanna go
To be
To feel

I am the black gold of the sun

I am the black gold of the sun

I am the black gold of the sun
I am the black gold of the sun

I am the white side of the sun
I am the black gold of the sun

I am the black gold of

I am the black gold of

I am the black gold of
I am the black gold of the sun
I am the black gold of
I am the black gold of
I am the black gold of the sun
I am the black gold of the sun
I am the black gold of the sun
