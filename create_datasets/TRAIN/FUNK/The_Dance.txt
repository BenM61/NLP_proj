I don't wanna give you my love
Cause I don't wanna lose my mind

I don't wanna give you my love
Cause if I do it's gonna be the last time

I never want to feel this way again
If I can't be a lover
I don't wanna be you're friend, no
I don't wanna be friends, no

I don't wanna hold you're hand
Cause I just wanna follow you everywhere

I don't wanna see you dance
I don't even really want to take the chance
Of fallin' in love with you baby

Cause if you ever said beautiful words to me
If I wanna be you're fantasy, yes
I wanna dance
Yes

Oh, baby

I don't wanna give you my love

I don't wanna go to fast
Cause if I do you just might stay
You just might stay
I guess I have a lonely dance
The longer that I feel this way

I never want to feel this way again
If I can't be a lover
I don't wanna be you're friend

I don't wanna be friends, no

I just want this to end

I don't wanna give you my love
Cause I don't wanna lose my mind

Go home, baby
You know you can't handle this
