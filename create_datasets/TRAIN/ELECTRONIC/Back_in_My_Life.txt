Want you back in my life
I want you back in my life
Want you back by my side
'Cause that's where you belong
Oh and I
I won't give you up
I will never stop
My love is much too strong
I want you back in my life
Want you back by my side
Cause that's where you belong
Oh and I
I won't give you up
I will never stop
My love is much too strong
Look at me
Standing here
Crying out my final tears
Look at me in the rain
All that I won't name again
Look at me
Standing here
Crying out my final tears
Look at me in the rain
Calling out your name again
Remember when you told me
You didn't want anybody else but me
And I'm that same girl
That's all you need to see
I want you back in my life
Want you back by my side
'Cause that's where you belong
Oh and I
I won't give you up
I will never stop
My love is much too strong
Look at me
Standing here
Crying out my final tears
Look at me in the rain
All that I won't name again
