I torture rock stars with pliers
They're so stock, it wouldn't be a shock
If I open them up to see wires
I destroy all amplifiers
People climbing over bodies like spiders
I'm on stage with a face like a sack of screwdrivers

And it's gonna be a show stop, road block
And we are the epicentre of the bedrock of a new sound
I say we're coming for you
And I say it with face like a sack of screw, screw, screw, screw

What's your criteria?
Complete hysteria
Decibels so max you can yell out your deep secrets
Nobody's gonna hear you
What's your medium?
Complete delirium
The lunatics took over the asylum
En garde

Warning, this escalates quickly
Are you getting nervous?
Are you getting nervous?
The mist rolls in thickly
Are you getting nervous?
Have you lost your nerve?

Warning, this escalates quickly
Are you getting nervous?
Are you getting nervous?
The mist rolls in thickly
Are you getting nervous?
Have you lost your nerve?

What's your technique?
So so so so unique
F*ck ego, minimise the self
Maximise the bond, the clique
What's your business here?
Sit back and witness sheer chaos
You can't keep track of the hell we raise
