Hey man, hey man
Just get closer
Let it take over

Hey man, hey man
I only got three minutes to explain myself
But don't stop dancing
Just listen to me

I've been on this stage of life before
I told myself don't do this no more
As you can see I'm here again
Doing it over and over and over again

This ain't what I want
This ain't what I need
You better stop this thing
Don't do it to me

This ain't what I want
This ain't what I need
Just set me free
