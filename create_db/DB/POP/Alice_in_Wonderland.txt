Alice in Wonderland
How do you get to Wonderland
Over the hill or underland
Or just behind the tree

When clouds go rolling by
They roll away and leave the sky
Where is the land behind the eye
That people cannot see

Where can it be
Where do the stars go
Where is the crescent moon
They must be somewhere in the sunny afternoon

Alice in Wonderland
Where is the path to Wonderland
Over the hill or here or there
I wonder where

Alice in Wonderland
(How do you get to Wonderland)
(Over the hill or underland)
(Or just behind the tree)

Alice in Wonderland
Where is the path to Wonderland
Over the hill or here or there
I wonder where

(Oh Alice, Oh Alice)
