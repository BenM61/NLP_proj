Can you see this light between us
Keeps me breathing through the storm
My head above the crowd

Can you see this light between us
So come a little bit closer now
It's in our eyes

You and me, we're just believers
Believing what we hold
But sometimes we fall to pieces
In the dusk

So we should dance like this forever
We're safer on the ground
When a million lights surround you
And you're moving to the sound

Don't waste another moment
It's waiting for you now
So dive in this new beginning
Let the glowing show you how

I will take, this light between us
Keeps me breathing through the storm
My head above the crowd

Can you see this light between us
So come a little bit closer now
It's in our eyes

We'll take a ride outside together
The streets are lined with gold
Where the good become the wanted
Not the soul

Don't waste another moment
I'm waiting for you now
So dive in this new beginning
And let the colour show you how

I will take, this light between us
Keeps me breathing through the storm
My head above the crowd

Can you see this light between us
So come a little bit closer now
It's in our eyes
It's in our eyes

So dive in this new beginning
And let the colour show you how

I will take, this light between us
Keeps me breathing through the storm
My head above the crowd

Can you see this light between us
So come a little bit closer now
It's in our eyes
It's in our eyes

It's in our eyes
