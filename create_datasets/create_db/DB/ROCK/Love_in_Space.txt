Love in space I dream of you
Love in space I scream to you
Love in space I cry for you
Love in space I fly to you

Drifting in our capsules of icy mist
The ship of dreams sails...

Love in space I dream of you
Love in space I plead for you
Love in space I sigh for you
Love in space I'd die for you

Drifting in our capsules of icy mist
The ship of dreams sails...
Love in space
Love in space
Love in space
Love in space

Drifting in our capsules of icy mist
The ship of dreams sails
On and on...

You say there's life out there in the galaxy
Our worlds in collision
You say that's a fallacy
It's no use sending rockets into space
Hoping to meet a supreior race

Most of our problems are here on Earth
Our planet's still living
It's our place of birth

Love in space I dream of you
Love in space I scream to you
Love in space I cry for you
Love in space I fly to you
Love in space I dream of you
Love in space I plead for you
Love in space I sigh for you
Love in space I'd die for you
