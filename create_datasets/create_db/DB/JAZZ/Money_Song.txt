If you got it you don't need it
If you need it you don't got it
You don't get shame on you
Funny funny funny what money can do

Them that have it get more of it
Less they need it the more they love it
And it sticks to them like glue
Funny funny funny what money can do

Ask the rich man he'll confess
Money can't buy happiness
Ask the poor man he don't doubt
But he'd rather be miserable with than without

If you spend it please be wiser
If you save it you're a miser
You don't want it you're cuckoo
