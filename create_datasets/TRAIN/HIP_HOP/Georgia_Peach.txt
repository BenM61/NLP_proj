First thangs first, I sheeda
F*ck around with no man who wount eat her
I don't need em, ain't tryin to see em
Yo mommy, daddy, them, ain't tryin to meet em
Halmark cards, ain't tryin to read em
Yea I can cook, but I ain't tryin to feed him
Nothing but this vagina, steven
Ya dick little, need ya tongue to make it even
Slow down, stop speeding
You 20 something, suppose to been stop teethin
Its been 20 mintues, has this nigga stop breathin
I know he down there, I ain't even seen him
Damn, where he at, there he go
I'm a super woman, so I need a lil mo
And I ain't nothing like ya hoes

You on the run, gotta federal case?
I know a place you can bury your face
Yum yum, gone get ya a taste
Gotta shake, let it go like mase
But ya tongue gotta know how to act
From the front all the way to the back
Its therapeutic and it helps me relax
I got them goodies, boy get you a snack
I dare a nigga try to act like he don't want to
Hate women, niggas say what he wount do
You talkin to a girl standin on her own two
If I want to, I can do it with my own two
So you gotta work it, do some tongue tricks
It takes dedication, I don't cum quick
So put ya shoulders in it, catch a neck cramp
Cause I gotta have that tongue like a wet stamp

Wassup baby? you scared?
Put my hands on the back of your head
And keep it there, don't stop
Lick it up til the very last drop
And go down, (downnnnn)

Real girls make them boys get low, ok
Where he at, there he go
Real girls make them boys get low, ok
Where he at, there he go
Real girls make them boys get low, get low
Where he at, there he go
Real girls make them boys get low, get low

Wassup baby? you scared?
