But my baby don't love nobody but me, nobody but me
Oh, everybody wants my baby
But my baby don't want nobody but me; that's plain to see

Honest, I ain't talking Greek
No one can come between us
She's my Sheba, I am her Sheik

Yes, everybody loves my baby
But my baby love nobody but me, yeah, nobody but me
