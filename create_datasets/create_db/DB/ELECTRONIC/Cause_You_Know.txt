Making promises I can't keep
Do I show, I'm empty
Should I beg for your mercy?
Do you know, I'm glad to be
There's a whole progression

Is this the end of everything?
Do you hear me when I weep?
Cause I search, I search for peace
If I should die within my sleep
So you know, hold me

Nothing but you can taste so sweet
Do I go, are you with me?
Cause you know I'm in too deep
Cause you know, lonely
Is this the end?
Is this the end of everything?
