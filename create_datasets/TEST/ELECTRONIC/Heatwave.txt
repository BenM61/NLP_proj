You live beneath another star
You are pretending love is worth waiting for
You always breathe another air
The rivers in the distance must be leading somewhere
Heatwave, Heatwave
Why is it rolling down on the young and foolish?
Heatwave, Heatwave
Are we rich or poor ?
Does it matter anymore?
Heatwave
Can this be all we will desire ?
Straw houses in the promised land
Why is it time for taking sides ?
When all I say and do is take too many chances
Heatwave, Heatwave
Why is it rolling down on the young and foolish ?
Heatwave, Heatwave
Are we rich or poor ?
Does it matter anymore?
Heatwave
Will I tell you ?
Will you listen ?
If I tell you, what will happen ?
Heatwave, Heatwave
Why is it rolling down on the young and foolish ?
Heatwave, Heatwave
Are we rich or are we poor ?
Does it matter anymore?
In a heatwave
Heatwave, Heatwave
Why is it rolling down on the young and foolish ?
Heatwave, Heatwave
Are we rich or are we poor ?
Does it matter anymore?
In a heatwave
