You know I care for you
But pretend and lead me on, that's all you do
I try to still believe but now I'm through
And the only place I see is calling out to me
It's the only place I know
It's the place where I must go
On the moon, that's where you'll find me soon.
I'll be alone again
That's okay, I must be on my own again.
I'll be waiting on the moon for you
I sit and reminisce for many hours
I miss the rain and all the pretty flowers
I dream of all the cities and their towers
And I hope you wonder why
I'm lying in the sky
I'll even let you in for free
If you come and visit me
On the moon, that's where you'll find me soon.
I'll be alone again
And all I'll do is to lie there till I die there
Waiting on the moon for you
Would you ever even dream to go to the extreme
And would you ever want to be the one to rescue me
On the moon, that's where you'll find me soon.
All alone again
Unwinding there and praying that you'll find me there
Waiting on the moon for you
On the moon, that's where you'll find me soon.
And still your face will be haunting me
So if you're ever wanting me
I'll be waiting on the moon for you
