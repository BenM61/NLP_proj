Walkin? with you hand in hand
I'm so proud to be your man
Take you out and show you off
Wine and dine in the finest restaurant

Go home and light the fire place
The mood is hot and so are we
Horizontal on Egyptian sheets
Baby, can you guess what we'd be doin'?

Unanticipated passionate exchanges
'Cause you got me in the mood for things that lovers do
Visions dancing in my head, I see you and me in bed
Let's rush home and continue the things that lovers do

Baby, I've made plans, a romantic evenin'
Ooh, I laid it out for you
But after work just come straight home

(Incomprehensible) your favorite dish
And plums and black lace after that
Candlelit bubble bath
That's where I'm gonna give my love to you

'Cause you got me in the mood for things that lovers do
Visions dancing in my head, I see you and me in bed
Let's rush home and continue the things that lovers do

Feel my baby takin' me high
The way you love me is so fly
No words can even describe
The way you're makin' me feel
Can you, can you do it again, baby?

The way you love me is so fly
No words can even describe

No words can even describe
Feel so good
Can you do it again?

Oh, do it again, baby

If you only knew what I think about me and you
I just can't tell you so 'cause it's too so hot to know
I can't tell you how you're makin' me so, ooh baby
Gimme some more, gimme some more, gimme some more
