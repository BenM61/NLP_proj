There's nothing very funny
About a man making money
Off a blonde haired blue eyed girl
He's got a child at home 
Who he loves to leave alone
For his blonde haired blue eyed girl

Well, Carmell
Where you gonna run to
When the sky comes crashing in on you?
Slow down
Who you gonna turn to
When there's nothing left for you to prove?

And I can't
Control myself
And I won't 
Be no one else
No I can't
Control myself
And I wouldn't want to 
Be anywhere else
It's true
What they say about you
Is true
What they say about you
Is true 
You know it too

Carmel,
Where you gonna run to
If the sky comes crashing in on you?
Slow down
Who're you gonna turn to
When there's nothing left for you to prove?

And I can't 
Control myself
And I won't
Be no one else
And I can't control myself
And I wouldn't want to 
Be anywhere else
It's true 
What they say about you

You know it too

No I can't
Control myself
And I won't
Be anyone else
No I can't
Control myself
And I wouldn't want to 
Be anyone else
