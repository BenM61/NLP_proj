Uh well, dance all night, play all day
Don't let nothin' get in the way
Dance all night, keep the beat
Don't you worry 'bout two left feet

Shake it up
Shake it up, oo yeah
Shake it up

You don't need no bad excuse
Dance all night with anyone
Don't let nobody pick your fun

Make the night cats stop and stare
Dance all night, go to work
Do the move with a quirky jerk

Let them know what you really mean
And dance all night, keep the beat
And don't you worry 'bout two left feet
