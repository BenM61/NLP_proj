Round her neck she wore a yellow ribbon
She wore it in the winter
And the merry month of May
When I asked her: Why the yellow ribbon?
She said: It's for my lover who is far far away

Far away, far away, far away, far away
She said: It's for my lover who is far far away
Far away, far away, far away, far away
She said: It's for my lover who is far far away

When, at first, she met a winsome Johnny
He wasn't sure her heart was pure
Her eyes were far too bold
So, round her neck
He tied a yellow ribbon
He tied a yellow ribbon
'Cause it matched her hair of gold

Hair of gold, hair of gold
He tied a yellow ribbon
'Cause it matched her hair of gold
Hair of gold, hair of gold
He tied a yellow ribbon
For her eyes were far too bold

If, perchance, you spy a lovely maiden

And by her side, there walks with pride
A Johnny strong and gay
And round her neck there is a yellow ribbon
No matter how you love her
Please stay far far away

Far away, far away, far away, far away
No matter how you love her
Please stay far far away
Far away, far away, far away, far away
Her love is for another
So stay far far away
Far far away

Round her neck she wore a yellow ribbon
She wore it in the winter
And the merry month of May
When I asked her: Why the yellow ribbon?
She said: It's for my lover who is far far away

Far away, far away
She said: It's for my lover who is far far away
Far away, far away
She said: It's for my lover who is far far away

Far far away
For her lover who is far far away
