      Yes I know, know your love is gone
      And you feel, you can't carry on
      The burden gets heavier
      And your sorrows are deeper, girl

      You've got to give a little, take a little
      Pay the price, make a sacrifice
      Give a little, take a little
      True love's a game if you give and take

      Remember Romeo and Juliet
      How they gave and took a lot, don't you forget
      I know it's so hard to believe
      But be smart and you won't have to fear

      You've got to give a little, take a little
      Pay the price, make a sacrifice
      Give a little, take a little
      True love's a game if you give and take

      Yes, you'll say you haven't lost your faith
      You'll get tired of this long wait
      You must give if you want to get
      If you do that you know you won't regret
