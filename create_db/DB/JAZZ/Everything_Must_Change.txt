Everything Must Change

Everything must change
Nothing stays the same
Everyone willl change
No one stays the same

The young become the old
Mysteries do unfold
For that's the way of time
Nothing and no one goes unchanged

There are not many things in life
You can be sure of...

Except, rain comes from the clouds
Sun light up the sky
Hummingbirds do fly

Winter turns to spring
The wounded heart will heal
But never much to soon
But everything must change

The young become the old
Mysteries do unfold
But that's the way that time
Nothing 

Except, rain comes from the clouds
Sun light up the sky
music makes me cry
