Every time I go to the movies

All I see is happy love on the silver screen.
Everywhere I go I see men and women lovin'

Kissin' and a-huggin'
enjoyin' life.
Oh
what's the matter with me

Am I lonely

Is there anybody out there who feels the same?

Every time I turn on my T.V.

I see somebody lovin' somebody.
Are you getting enough happiness?
Are you getting enough of what makes you happy?
Are you getting enough happiness?
Are you getting enough of what makes you happy?

Every time I open a book

Or read a magazine

There's happy love everywhere I look.
Every page I turn I can read between the lines

That the boys gonna get it
get it tonight.
Oh
what's the matter with me

Am I the only one

Oh
is there somebody out there who feels the same?

Every time I turn on my radio

I hear a love song playing on every show.
Are you getting enough happiness?...

I need excitement in my life.
I need happiness
happiness every night.
I need someone to call upon when the need is strong

For lovin'
for lovin'.

Are you gettting enough happiness?...
