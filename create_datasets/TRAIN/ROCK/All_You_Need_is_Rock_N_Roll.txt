(3:15)   are you feeling down  are you all alone  have your
dreams been shattered  have you lost all hope  all you need is
music  it's your destiny, it sets you free   whoh, ohh, ohh, ohh
 all you need is rock'n'roll  whoh, ohh, ohh, ohh  whoh, ohh,
ohh, ohh  all you need is rock'n'roll  whoh, ohh, ohh, ohh   you
can raise your hands  you can stomp your feet  get down and turn
around  you can do it all cause there ain't no rules  when you
feel the music  just move your feet, to that heavy beat   whoh,
ohh, ohh, ohh  all you need is rock'n'roll  whoh, ohh, ohh, ohh 
whoh, ohh, ohh, ohh  all you need is rock'n'roll  whoh, ohh,
ohh, ohh   whoh, ohh, ohh, ohh  all you need is rock'n'roll 
whoh, ohh, ohh, ohh  whoh, ohh, ohh, ohh  all you need is
rock'n'roll  whoh, ohh, ohh, ohh
