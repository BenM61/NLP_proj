If and betting on an if, and if that if might have a chance to survive.
It runs in to twelve different ways of existing each with capacity to change its mind.
The vibe says six, so be six, now it has a clone. That is a bit more feminine.
Pondering the paces of what's going down life. And the greeting is, "Oh its you again."
Now come the images so many images. The painful colors and the bliss like tries.
I'm taking notes till the end of theatrics, then it stops, ends, dies
Whatever is whatever, it calculates the karma.
And tries to adjust as it inquires whats shaking.
But through no eyes, I could see the entity crying.

I cry, when midnight sighs, I cry, when midnight sighs.

Let's pretend its true, no, facade. The vibe says seven, do I look surprised? No.
You, you're so disturbing. Anxious tears do these paint my eyes oh.
The mysterious fee no one sees. And no one tries. 
Whenever tangible,
I'll fall out of love. But for now my mind isn't mine
Sporadic advice, never thinks twice,
But exotic thoughts conclude this frenzy. 
Pay no no attention to the scars.
However bright all the men see is precious you. 
Immaculate trues, Patient lies say,
"Prince your flying", yeah. 
But through no thoughts, I could see this concept crying.

I cry, when midnight sighs, I cry, when midnight sighs.

When midnight sighs, 
If about to be me it's. 
So the vibe say five.
I put on hooves horns and an attitude. 
And nonchalantly find I'm alive... twelve AM
I understand. I find the eight, too late, its gone. 
But I could see this woman crying
"Cussing, crying, and carrying on my God"

I cry, when midnight sighs, I cry, when midnight sighs.
