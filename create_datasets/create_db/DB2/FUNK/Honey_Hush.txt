Ah, let 'em roll like a big wheel
In a Georgia cotton field
Honey, hush

Now baby, come in this house, stop all that yackety yack
I say come in this house baby, stop all that yackety yack
Come fix my supper, don't want no talkin' back

Well, you keep on jabberin', you talk about this and that
Well, you keep on jabberin', you talk about this and that
I got news for you baby, you ain't nothin' but an alley cat

Turn off the waterworks, baby, they don't move me no more
Turn off the waterworks, baby, they don't move me no more
When I leave this time, I ain't comin' back no more

Honey hush

I say come in this house, stop all that yackety yack
Come in here woman, stop all that yackety yack
Don't make me nervous, 'cause I'm holdin' a baseball bat

Singin' hi-yo, hi-yo silver
(Hi-yo, hi-yo silver)
Sing hi-yo, hi-yo silver
(Hi-yo, hi-yo silver)
Sing hi-yo, hi-yo silver
(Hi-yo, hi-yo silver)
Sing hi-yo, hi-yo silver
(Hi-yo, hi-yo silver)
Sing hi-yo, hi-yo silver
(Hi-yo, hi-yo silver)
Sing, hi-yo silver away
