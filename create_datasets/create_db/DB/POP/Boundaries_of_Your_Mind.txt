Save a little of your energy
Spend a little of your time with me
What is it that holds you here to me?
You must be moved by something that you see
Strains of magic in the moonlight hours
Render useless all your Earthly powers
Souvenirs of childhood haunt your face
It must be that they've fallen from your grace

And the rage burns inside
Like a cage that's open wide
Empty now, but once it held
The boundaries of your mind
Privacy and loneliness
They overlap sometimes, sometimes

Subtleties betray you everywhere
That's a secret you forgot to share
Like how auburn still brings out your guilty streak
And seemingly it adds to your mystique
Moody silhouettes, you soon replace
With swarms of passersby that flood your space
Your superficial scars, you can conceal
There are others left with wounds that will not heal

And the rage burns inside
Like a cage that's open wide
Empty now, but once it held
The boundaries of your mind
Privacy and loneliness
They overlap sometimes
Empty now, but once it held
The boundaries of your mind
Privacy and loneliness
They overlap sometimes

And the rage burns inside
Like a cage that's open wide
Empty now, but once it held
The boundaries of your mind
Privacy and loneliness
They overlap sometimes

Save a little of your energy
Spend a little of your time with me
What is it that holds you here to me?
