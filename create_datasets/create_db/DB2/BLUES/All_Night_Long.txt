I know baby, what you're trying to do
You can't love me and my buddy, too
Oh babe, my babe, oh baby

If I had a known like I know now
I wouldn't a been tied up with ya, no how
Oh babe, my babe, oh baby

It's funny, oh my honey how we had to start
I wasn't thinkin' but you were thinkin'
How to break my heart

The way seem hard but I guess it's fair
I had a good home and I wouldn't stay there
Oh babe, oh babe, my babe

Yes, swing now
I hear ya Mr. piano player
Dog, yeah, that's it
'I'm gon' do it again for ya, everybody'

If you lose your head, you know
What goes with it finally
Look at that sax man, yes

I know baby, what you tryin' to do
You can't love me and my buddy, too
Oh babe, oh babe, my baby

If I had a known like I know, now
I wouldn't have been tied up with ya, no how
Oh babe, oh babe, my baby

It's funny, oh my honey, how we had to start
I wasn't thinkin', you was thinkin'
How to break my heart

The way seem hard but I guess it's fair
I had a good home and I wouldn't stay there
Oh babe, oh baby, oh babe

Yeah, swing it now, yeah, yes
Oh, you's goin' take us low
A long time in Georgia, somewhere
Yas, yas, yas-yas
Mellow fellow, like you wanna go dance

Oh, the way seem hard but I guess it's fair
I had a good home and wouldn't stay there
Oh babe, oh baby, oh babe, oh babe, yeah
