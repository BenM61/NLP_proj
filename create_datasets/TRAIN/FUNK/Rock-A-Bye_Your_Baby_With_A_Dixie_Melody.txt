Rock-a-bye your baby with a Dixie melody
When you croon 
Croon a tune from the heart of Dixie
And just hang my cradle, mammy mine 
Right on that Mason Dixon line 
And swing it from Virginia 
To Tennessee with all the heart that's in ya

Weep no more, my lady 
Sing that song again for me
Hey little Joe, just as though 
You had me on your knee

A million baby kisses I'm gonna deliver
The minute that you sing that Swanee River
Rock-a-bye your rock-a-bye baby with a Dixie melody

Weep no more, my fair lady 
Why don't you sing that song for me?
Hey little Joe, just as though 
You had me on your knee

A million baby kisses, I said, I said I'm gonna deliver
The minute that you sing that Swanee River
Rock-a-bye your rock-a-bye baby with a Dixie melody

One more time, yeah

A million baby kisses, I'm gonna deliver
The minute that you sing that Swanee River
Rock-a-bye your rock-a-bye baby with a Dixie melody
