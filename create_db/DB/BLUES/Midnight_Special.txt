You get up in the mornin'
You hear the ding dong ring
Yeah, you look upon the table
You see the same darn thing

You find no food upon the table
No pork up in the pan
But if you say a thing about it
You'll be in trouble with the man

Ah, let the midnight special
Shine her light on me
Oh, let the midnight special
Shine its ever-lovin' light on me

Oh, if you're ever in a Houston
Oh, you better walk right
Ah, you better not gamble boy
I say you better not fight

You know the sheriff, he'll grab you
And the boys will pull you down
And then before you know it now
You're penitentiary bound

Ah, let the midnight special
Shine her light on me
Ah, let the midnight special
Shine its ever-lovin' light on me

Here comes Miss Lucy
How in the world do you know
I can tell by her apron
And by the clothes she wore

An umbrella on her shoulder
A paper in her hand
She's gonna see the warden
To try to free her man

Ah, let the midnight special
Shine her light on me, oh yeah
Ah, let the midnight special
Shine its ever-lovin' light on me

I said, "Let the midnight special
Shine her light on me
Uh, let the midnight special
Shine its ever-lovin' light on me"
