Close your eyes give me you hand, darling 
Do you feel my heart beating do you understand 
Do you feel the same 
Am I only dreaming 
Is this burning 
An eternal flame 

I believe it's meant to be, darling 
I watch you when you are sleeping 
You belong with me 
Do you feel the same 
Am I only dreaming or is this burning an eternal flame 

Say my name sun shine's through the rain 
A whole life so lonely an then come and ease the pain 
I don't wanna lose this feeling, oooh. (x2)

Close your eyes give me you hand, 
Do you feel my heart beating do you understand 
You feel the same 
Am I only dreaming 
But this burning 
An eternal flame
