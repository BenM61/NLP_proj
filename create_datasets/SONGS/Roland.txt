Hey, my best friend's a butcher, he has sixteen knives 
He carries them all over the town
At least he tries oh look it stopped snowing
My best friend's from Poland and oh he has a beard
But they caught him with his case in a public place
That is what we had feared

He severed segments and secretly liked that 
He always took the time to speak with me I liked him for that 
He severed segments and secretly liked that 
He always took the time 
He always took the time 

C'mon now pussycat
