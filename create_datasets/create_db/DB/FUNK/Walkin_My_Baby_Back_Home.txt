Gee, it's great after bein' out late
Walkin' my baby back home
Arm in arm over meadow and farm
Walkin' my baby back home

We go 'long harmonizing a song
Or I'm recitin' a poem
Owls go by and they give me the eye
Walkin' my baby back home

We stop for a while, she gives me a smile
And snuggles her head on my chest
We start in to pet and that's when I get
Her talcum all over my vest

After I kinda straighten my tie
She has to borrow my comb
Once kiss then I continue again
Walkin' my baby back home

She's afraid of the dark so I have to park
Outside of her door till it's light
She says if I try to kiss her she'll cry
I dry her tears all through the night

Hand in hand to a barbecue stand
Right from her doorway we roam
Eats and then it's a pleasure again
Walkin' my baby
Talkin' my baby
Lovin' my baby
I don't mean maybe
Walkin' my baby back home
