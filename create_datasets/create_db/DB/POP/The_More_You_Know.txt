How do you, get even with your sacred senses
Every time, your brother don't mind
I don't know, we've been running through your friendship
Try to, deep in time
Your brother don't know

First to touch, when you lose
Finally time again
Talk, talk, talk will spill the cup
Then break you down and then

Put your thoughts to action
And the consequence is mine
You don't know
You don't know
You're making time

So who's to blame, don't ever doubt it
Your brother don't know
I said who's to blame
Don't ever doubt it
Your brother don't know

Last time you tried to ride it
Check yourself and realize
Your ability, your ability, your ability
And the more you try to push that limit
How you justify you might not get it
So you're backing out, a sign of your disability

Eh! I don't mind and they don't care
But your brother does
I said, I don't mind and they don't care
But your brother does

Who to believe, Who to believe in
Who to believe, Who to believe in

Acts of faith set you apart
And it's alright, 'cause your brother don't know

Escape gets you going
So you finally try again
But the down and out they call the police
So they push you back again

And then you get to get it screaming
And the lessons you seem to never learn
It's all about being human
I believe it is your turn

Say my brother is my brother (brother)
My brother is my soul (brother)
I said my brother is my brother (brother)
Yes brother is my soul (brother)
