I used to walk around like
Nothing could happen to me
Life is a gamble so I
Should live life more carefully
But all I know is that I 
Control my own destiny
I used to look at others
Instead of me blaming me

Don't ask yourself why
Just look to the sky
Believe that soon you'll see the other side

I know that through all the struggle
There's a bright road
At the end of the tunnel
Now you should know
Whatever your dilemma may be
You'll learn life is worth it 
Watch the tables turn

Whenever you feel troubled 
With problems coming your way
Don't ever get discouraged 
There's always a better day
We all don't know the answers
Believe and trust when I say
That havin' faith is always
The way to make things okay

Don't ask yourself why
Just look to the sky
Believe that soon you'll see the other side

I know that through all the struggle
There's a bright road
At the end of the tunnel
Now you should know
Whatever your dilemma may be
You'll learn life is worth it 
Watch the tables turn

You've had your ups and downs but
It happened for a reason
Cause after April showers 
There will come a change of season
So please don't give up now cuz
The sun's shinin' through the clouds
It's gonna be alright
I know

I know that through all the struggle
There's a bright road
At the end of the tunnel
Now you should know
Whatever your dilemma may be
You'll learn life is worth it 
Watch the tables turn

I know that through all the struggle
There's a bright road
At the end of the tunnel
Now you should know
Whatever your dilemma may be
You'll learn life is worth it 
Watch the tables turn
