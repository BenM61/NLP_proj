Like a sweet melody 
Memories of your love still linger on inside of me 
A recurring dream 
Visions of you return night after night so hauntingly 
I lay awake 'til four or five without you by my side 
I never knew how much you were a part of me 
I was a fool, so unaware yet now I see 
So many words I never took the time to say 
I guess you don't know what you've got 
Until you've gone and let it slip away 

After we said goodbye 
Baby I finally realized 
That I just cannot walk away 
'Cause this love for you still remains in my heart 
And you come to me. Every time that I close my eyes 
You're all that I can see 
I am never free 
Even when I'm asleep I feel your presence here with me 
I try so hard to just hold on 
When I wake you're gone 
I never knew how much you were a part of me 
I was a fool so unaware yet now I see 
So many words I never took the time to say 
I guess you don't know what you've got 
Until you let it slip away 

Although you've gone away 
I tell you my feelings never change 
I'm missing you every night and day 
And it's driving me crazy baby 
My love for you remains 
I'm tired of playing foolish games 
I know that I'm the one to blame 
And I miss you like crazy, baby 

After we said goodbye 
Baby I finally realized 
That I just cannot walk away 
'Cause this love for you still remains in my heart 
And you come to me. Every time that I close my eyes 
You're all that I can see 
I am never free 
Even when I'm asleep I feel your presence here with me 
I try so hard to just hold on 
When I wake you're gone 
I never knew how much you were a part of me 
I was a fool so unaware yet now I see 
So many words I never took the time to say 
I guess you don't know what you've got 
Until you let it slip away 

My heart, baby I miss you 
I was a fool to let you walk away 
I realize girl 
After we said goodbye
