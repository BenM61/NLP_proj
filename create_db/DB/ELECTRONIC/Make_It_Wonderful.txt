Tell me something new
There are stories to be told
Dreams shattering
Lies are flattering

Walks across the stage
There are secrets to behold
Thoughts are gathering
Light scattering

Lay your words upon me kindly
Just to remind me
I'm blinded by the lights
Whisper something gently to me
The words of love you know
I'm blinded by the light

You make it wonderful

See the northern lights
As they dance across the sky
They are inspiring
They take your breath away

Some will walk alone
They will never know the truth
Hidden messages
Shine like diamonds

Lay your words upon me kindly
Just to remind me
I'm blinded by the lights
Whisper something gently to me
The words of love you know
I'm blinded by the light

You make it wonderful
You make it wonderful

Innocence is so inspiring like a child will dream at night
When my ship comes in so full of wonder and remorse

Lay your words upon me kindly
Just to remind me
I'm blinded by your lights
Whisper something gently to me
The words of love you know
I'm blinded by the light

You make it wonderful
You make it wonderful
You make it wonderful
You make it wonderful
