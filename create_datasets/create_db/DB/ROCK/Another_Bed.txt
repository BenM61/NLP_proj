The reminder
That we don't know who you are
And I preferred her when you lie
And I preferred her when she took all night
Stand on
Stand on
You'll find it in another bed

Another bit on the side
And I preferred her when she took all night
And you were only wondering home

I'll find you
You're older
I'll hold you 
When it's over
When you're waiting for the door to go
And now you're breaking your back in your new hole
When you're waiting for the door to go
And now you're breaking your back in your new hole
I'll find you, don't worry

And I preferred her when you lie

Stand on
A little bit on the side

I'll find you
You're older
I'll hold you

When you're waiting for the door to go
And now you're breaking your back in your new hole
When you're waiting for the door to go
And now you're breaking your back in your new hole
I'll find you , don't worry

Leave your heart in the house now
So he will never know
You'll leave your heart in the house now
So he will never know

I'll find you
You're older
I'll hold you
