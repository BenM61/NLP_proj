Love
It's a special day
We should celebrate and appreciate
That you and me found something pretty neat
And I know some say this day is arbitrary

But it's a good excuse
That I love to use baby I know what to do baby I,
I will love you, I'll love you, I'll love you

Love
I don't need those things
I don't need no ring
I don't need anything
But you with me 'cause in your company
I feel happy oh so happy and complete

And it's a good excuse
That I love to use baby I know what to do baby I,
I will love you, I'll love you, I'll love you
Yeah it's a good excuse
That I love to use baby I know what to do baby I,
I will love you, I'll love you, I'll love you

So won't you be my honey bee giving me sweet kisses all the time
Be mine, be my
Valentine

So won't you be my honey bee giving me sweet kisses all the time
Be mine, be my
Valentine

Oh
Be my Valentine
