Stepping on the cracks in the pavement
Another night of being wasted
Staring at your name
Staring at your name

I think you're hanging out somewhere downtown
I wonder who you're dancing with now
Are you doing the same?
Are you doing the same?

Close my eyes and we're still naked
But then I see that my clock is changing
It's just another night
On the other side

Oh woah, oh woah woah
It's just another night
On the other side

On the other side

Hiding underground with the cool kids
I just choose to not wanna choose this
We're living different lives
We're living different lives

There's gonna be a way between us
Tearing down the walls of secrets
It's just another night
On the other side

Oh woah, oh woah woah
It's just another night
On the other side
Oh woah, oh woah woah
It's just another night
On the other side
On the other side

Nothing's gonna keep us hostage
I don't want a thing to stop this tonight
Baby don't you think we lost it
Just come to me, yea

There's gotta be a way between us
Tearing down our walls of secrets
It's just another night
On the other side
