Well I'm tired and I gotta go home
I'm tired and I gotta go home
My baby told me she's gonna set me free
If I don't hurry back home

So I better be on my way
You know I cannot stay
It's been nice you know but I got to go
Yes I gotta go home

I left my baby my friend
I know she's waiting for me
Don't want to sing the blues, I got too much to lose
So I guess I better go home
