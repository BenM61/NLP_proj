It's not time to get started
It's time to call it off

I've been trying to find a reason to keep us together
Try to make up my bed of lies
And call the night my shelter

It's time to call it off
And this time, it's not my fault

(What time is it?)
It's time to walk out the door
It's time to get goin'
It's time to walk out the door
It's time to

You tried to blindfold me
From the pain you breathe
And you said you'd never leave
Yeah I'd been blamin' myself, question my mental health
Like I'm the one who needed questioning

It's time to call it off
And this time, it's not my fault

It's time to call it off
And this time, it's not my fault

It's time to walk out the door
It's time to get goin'
It's time to walk out the door
It's time to get goin'

It's time to walk out the door
It's time to, it's time to

Just can't make a thot a wife
No more basic, ratchet guys
Listen up, I'm saving you
From all the hell that you'll go through

Just can't make a thot a wife
No more basic, ratchet guys
Listen up, I'm saving you
I'm saving you, I'm saving you

It's time to call it off
And this time, it's not my fault

It's time to call it off
And this time, it's not my fault

It's time to walk out the door
It's time to, it's time to
