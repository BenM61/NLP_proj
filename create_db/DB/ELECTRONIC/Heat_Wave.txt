You come closer still
Closer now, closer till
I can feel you and what you do
Ooh

It's nothing like real life,
Don't you know, I keep trying,
To keep it cool as ice,
But I'm melting, ooh yes I'm melting

Whenever you're around, you hit baby
I'm hit baby, whoa
Whenever you're around, you hit baby,
I'm hit baby,
Whoa

I run right up, dimension two,
I run with you,
I'm hit baby,
I don't know how, to stop it now,
I'm hit baby, ooh

It's nothing like real life,
Don't you know, I keep trying,
To keep it cool as ice,
But I'm melting, ooh yes I'm melting

Whenever you're around, you hit baby
I'm hit baby, whoa
Whenever you're around, you hit baby,
I'm hit baby,
Whoa
Whenever you're around, you hit baby
I'm hit baby, whoa
Whenever you're around, you hit baby,
I'm hit baby,
Whoa

It's nothing like real life,
Don't you know, I keep trying,
To keep it cool as ice,
But I'm melting, ooh yes I'm melting
Oh

Whenever you're around, you hit baby
I'm hit baby, I'm hit baby, I'm hit baby
Whenever you're around, you hit baby,
I'm hit baby

Whenever you're around, you hit baby
I'm hit baby, I'm hit baby
Whenever you're around, you hit baby,

Whenever you're around, you hit baby
I'm hit baby, I'm hit baby, I'm hit baby
Whenever you're around, you hit baby,
