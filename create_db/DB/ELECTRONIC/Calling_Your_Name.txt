There is something I have to say to you before
I am on my knees and I'm looking for some answers
You've got that certain something,
I don't know what to do
Don't tell me what is better, I'm just not a fool

Ah, should've never done that
Ah, why did I do that?
Ah, will you forgive me?
I'm calling, I'm calling your name
Ah, should've never done that
Ah, why do I do that?
Will you forgive me?

I'm calling, I'm calling your name
Where the winds would never lie
And I know that it can't be the same
Where the winds would never lie
I'm calling, I'm calling your name

I just can't let you go, can't let you get away
I'm such a fool for you and tired of being second to none
I'm gonna take you with me and chase the clouds away
Why can't you see your body's begging me to stay?

Ah, should've never done that
Ah, why did I do that?
Ah, will you forgive me?
I'm calling, I'm calling your name
Ah, should've never done that
Ah, why do I do that?
Will you forgive me?

I'm calling, I'm calling your name
Where the winds would never lie
And I know that it can't be the same
Where the winds would never lie
I'm calling, I'm calling your name

We are forever lovers
I just can't take any more
Why don't you call my name?
I wonder why I can't let go
We are forever lovers
I just can't take any more
