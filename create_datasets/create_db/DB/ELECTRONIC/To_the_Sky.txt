My memory
Feels like it's playing with me
These things I know
Yeah, I know

The sun will end with you
Need help to cut on through
Can only feel this way
When silence comes

I can sing it to the sky
There's a risk it won't reply
If I could change it, man I would
And I won't screw it up this time

Been here before
It won't happen no more
These things I know
Yeah, I know

They get into your mind
I guess you know the signs
Can only feel this way
When silence comes

I can sing it to the sky
There's a risk it won't reply
If I could change it, man I would
And I won't screw it up this time

I can sing it to the sky
There's a risk it won't reply
If I could change it, man I would
And I won't screw it up this time

I can sing it to the sky
There's a risk it won't reply
If I could change it, man I would
And I won't screw it up this time

I can sing it to the sky
There's a risk it won't reply
If I could change it, man I would
And I won't screw it up this time
