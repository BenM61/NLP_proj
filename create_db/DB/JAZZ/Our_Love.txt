Our love, I feel it everywhere
Through the night time, it is the message of the breeze.
Our love is like an evening prayer
I can hear it in every whisper of the trees

And so you're always near to me
Wherever you may be,
I see your face in stars above
As I dream of
The golden magic of our love.
