Can you handle it 
Can you handle it 
'Cause you ain't had nothing like it 

Can you handle it 
Can you handle it 
'Cause you ain't had nothing like it  

Boy just to feel my touch 
If you're not the best 
It might be too much 
Now you don't have to take my word 
Cause actions speak louder than words 
And I will be heard 

Can you handle it 
Can you handle it 
'Cause you ain't had nothing like it  

Can you handle it 
Can you handle it 

When it comes to love 
I'm the best 
Do you really think you could get by this 
Now if your score's not too high 
Don't feel like you're letting me down 
Cause all you can do is try 

Can you handle it 
Can you handle it 
'Cause you ain't had nothing like it 

Can you handle it 
Can you handle it 
Can you handle it baby 

Can you handle it 
Can you handle it 
'Cause you ain't had nothing like it  

Can you handle it 
Ain't nothing like it 

Just to feel my touch 
Just might be too much 
For you baby for you baby 

Can you handle it 
Ain't nothing like it 

Can you handle it 
Ain't nothing like it
