What a drag it is the shape I'm in
Well, I go out somewhere then I come home again

I light a cigarette 'cause I can't get no sleep
There's nothing on the TV, nothing on the radio
That means that much to me

All my life
Watching America
All my life
There's panic in America
Oh, there's trouble in America, oh

Yesterday was easy, happiness came and went
I got the movie script but I don't know what it meant

I light a cigarette 'cause I can't get no sleep
There's nothing on the TV, nothing on the radio
That means that much to me
There's nothing on the TV, nothing on the radio
That I can believe in

All my life
Watching America
All my life
There's panic in America
Oh, there's trouble in America
Oh, there's panic in America, oh

Yesterday was easy
Yes, I got the news
When you get it straight, but stand up you just can't lose
Give you my confidence, all my faith in life

Don't stand me up, don't let me down
I need you tonight
To hold me, say you'll be here 
To hold me, say you'll be here
To hold me, say you'll be here
To hold

All my life
Watching America
All my life
There's panic in America
Oh, she's just in America, oh

Tell me how does it feel
Tell me how does it feel
Tell me how does it feel
Tell me how does it feel
