Don't care about a thing today
I used to but I'm fed up
And I can hear the words you say
I wish that you would shut up

I've got responsibility
That is my liability
A menace to society
At least that's what they say to me

But tonight tonight it's on tonight
I don't want your boring life
And I don't want your 9 to 5
Or anyone to tell me how to live my life

People always tell me not to waste my time
To get a real job and get back in line
You can say I'll never be a millionaire
Tell me this guitar won't get me anywhere

I've got responsibility
That is my liability
I'm questioning authority
They say there's not a chance for me

But tonight tonight it's on tonight
I don't want your boring life
And I don't want your 9 to 5
Or anyone to tell me how to live my life

Your future's no future
Your future's no future
Your future's no future
I control my future

But tonight tonight it's on tonight
I don't want your boring life
And I don't want your 9 to 5
Or anyone to tell me how to live my life

Tonight tonight it's on tonight
I don't want your boring life
And I don't want your 9 to 5
Or anyone to tell me how to live my life

I'm leaving
I'm leaving
I'm leaving
I'm leaving tonight
