The algebras of the earth speak the worth
To draft the laws, the vale, the midwife birth the key,
The chemistry of common life

The speck on the bone
Grown to size by the poems
Coax the passions from the stone,
The chemistry of common life

Iron antlers fill the sky,
Metal organs fertilize,
Sparks and ingots come alive,
The chemistry of common life,
The chemistry of common life

Here but for the spinning of a sphere,
Electric skies and vibrations rise the breach,
the birth, the seed inside,
The chemistry of common life

Silver plated chaste embryo awakened by the touch
From the mater, the mother, the magnificence, the matter,
The river of steel that flows from high holy rods
Unite the dead to God creation,
The seal opens to touch the sky,
Aflame with life it burns beyond
To proclaim a marriage, a chemical bond
The chemistry of common life

Eruptions from below the sleeping face,
Molten veins and golden grains,
The power, the ecstasy, the grace,
The chemistry of common life

Here but for the spinning of a sphere
Tease the heavens that sanctify the sky,
Liquid life poured down excites the ores,
Ignite the crust, inseminate the dust,
The cultured quartz that rises high,
The stone refined that lives and shines,
Be the vessel, be the knife
Stone and metal come to life
In the crux the cross divine
The shell, the purpose, the sublime
Fill the chalice with the blade,
Wed the maker to the made,
Grow the divine from profane,
Let the shining never fade
Between the crystal and the womb,
Astride the pistil and the tomb,
Create from parts that were a man
The stars, to hum their song again
Fill the chalice with the blade,
Wed the maker to the made,
Grow the divine from profane,
Let the shining never fade,
Be the fire in the ice,
The chemistry of common life.
