[Chorus: x2]
Does anyone want to go
Waltzing in the garden?
Does anyone want to go 
Dance up on the roof?

On the town,
Sequins evening gown.
Climb those stairs
To that ballroom in the air
Get to poppin.'

[Chorus]

If you dare,
Dream of yesteryear.
In the air
Do a step with Fred Astaire.
Get your top hat.

[Chorus]

You can be
What you want to be
Come waltz with me
Or a hot steppin' boogie.
Funk in the pocket.

[Chorus]

No one stays
In downtown these days.
Country calls
Got us one and all.

Before we end
Let me recommend
What to do
When your heart is light or blue.
Get to steppin.'

Does anyone want to go 
Waltzing in the garden?
Does anyone want to go
Dance up on the roof?
