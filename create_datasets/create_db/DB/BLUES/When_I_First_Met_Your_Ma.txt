When I first met your mother
I was playing in a bar
She walked in with my girlfriend
My foolish girlfriend brought her there

She looked so pretty and dangerous
As she brushed back her hair
And I was not the only one
Taking notice in that bar

When I first met your ma
When I first kissed your mother
I was single once again
We walked through Fitzroy Gardens

There she took my hand
We could not stop our kissing
Then she whispered in my ear
'Soon you'll get to know me,

So let's not go too far'
When I first kissed your ma
Love like a bird flies away
You'll find out the only way

Love like a bird flies away
When we first lay together
Inside her father's house
We tired so to be quiet

As we held each other close
Then her dad came pounding and kicked me out of there
I walked two miles in Melbourne rain
I could have walked ten more

When I first loved your ma
Love like a bird flies away
You'll find out the only way
Love like a bird flies away
