They even looked at each other once across the crowded bar
He was with Martha, she was with Tom
Neither of them really knew what was going on
A strange feeling of never, heartbeats becoming synchronized

It's been that way forever but most of the time it's just near misses
Or kisses once at a bookstore, once at a party
She came in as he was leaving and years ago at the movies
She sat behind him, the 6:30 showing of "While You Were Sleeping"

He never once looked around

It's so easy from above 
You can really see it all
People who belong together
Lost and sad and small
But there's nothing to be done for them
It doesn't work that way
Sure we all have soulmates but we walk past them every day

And it's not like they were ever 
Actually unhappy in the lives they lived
He married Martha, she married Tom
Just this faint notion that something was wrong
An ache, an absence, a phantom limb

An itch that could never be scratched

It's so easy from above
You can really see it all
People who belong together
Lost and sad and small
But there's nothing to be done for them
It doesn't work that way
Sure we all have soulmates but we walk past them every day

Neither of them knew what was going on
A strange feeling of never, 
Heartbeats becoming synchronized

Stay that way forever

Who knows whether that's how it should be
Maybe a ghost lived in that vacancy

Maybe that's how books get written
Maybe that's why songs get sung
Maybe we are the unlucky ones
