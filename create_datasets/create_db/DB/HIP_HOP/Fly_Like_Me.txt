Now you've been around the world,
And you'd seen alot of girls,
But, you ain't neva seen a girl (look so fly like),
Now you've rolled through some hoods,
There's some girls that look good,
But, you ain't never seen a girl (look so fly like),
& you partied in some clubs
& some girls show you love,
But, you ain't never seen a girl look so fly like me
Baby, But chu never had a girl look so fly like me.

Now I'd done been around the world thought I'd seen it all
Er color, er shape, what I need and all,
Switch like seasons, when the summers, spring, & fall,
& back seat of my jeep, I'm chrome veet & all.
On the hunt for these girls were like my day to day,
I get em alone I jump em and then fade away,
I give it good so some of them won't stay away,
They try to lock me up, but I break away.
& to the day I lay my eyes on the princess,
& yu can tell she was a dime from a distance,
It took a minute to come to my senses,
She's the perfect match and God is my witness,
Now for the first time I've opened my eyes,
Put the glass in the air, now I toast to the sky,
Feels like I'm in heaven, & I'm hopin' to fly,
Baby girl come along for the ride, yu know why cuz I....

Now I ain't neva had a girl that was so fly,
Other guys come around, you actin' so shy,
You got em shakin' in their boots, and I know why,
Cuz they can't handle the truth and that's no lie,

As for me, I'm the one that you been dreamin' on,
& wen yu saw me I'm the one that yu were steamin' on,
& when yu need it I'm the shoulder that yu would be leanin' on,
Take off that Gucci and keep them vickie secrets on,
Let's take a flight because the world is our playground,
And buy houses from the lou, to the A-Town,
It's silk sheets so it's soft when yu lay down,
Ching-a-ling yea, I get down, and stay down,
There's no one better baby girl you'sz a blessin',
You got me headin' in a positive direction,
You got my vote, when yu re-up for election,
Cuz all I wanna do is give you love and affection.

When you can just come to me? [huh]
You know I got what you need,
