1994 BC still in the house They did
Everything they could do to take us out
But like any good monster that just made us stronger
You see, they don't like us and they don't like you,
The BC fan,
'Cause they know we stand for three things
Truth, justice and f*ck the American way
That word justice got me fucked up though
Twenty cops in the street, two go to jail
Thousands of people died in wars
Overseas and it's justice ?
You think they give a f*ck about us ?
You're a fool

Born yellow,
Born brown,
Born red,
Born black,
Born dead
Dead
Born dead

Born Asian,
Born Jewish,
Born Latino,
Born poor,
Born dead
Dead
Born dead

But you don't hear me though

Dead
New York , Atlanta, Chicago, Oakland, Miami, Detroit

Every day I gotta get out my muthafuckin' bed,
Put on my muthafuckin' gun,
Down in my muthafuckin' gun,
Down in my muthafuckin' pants, 'cause
Muthafucka's out here is trippin'

How the f*ck you gonna get up every morning
Tryin' to worry about if you gonna make it to the next evening
Do you understand ?
Sometimes we take for granted
The little things like food, like freedom

Born in Somalia,
Born in south America,
Born in south Africa,
Born in south central,
Born dead
Dead

Born dead
