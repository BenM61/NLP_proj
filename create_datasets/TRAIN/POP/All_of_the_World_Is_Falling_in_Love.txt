All of the world is falling in love
The sound of love is in the air
It's everywhere
Think of the love that we have to give
The world as one and let live
For love is the reason
And now is the season
For sharing
For giving
And caring
All of the world is falling in love
The sound of love is in the air
It's everywhere
Look at the world that we call our own
The children sing out alone
A new day is dawning
A new way is coming
I love you
You love me
We are love
All of the world is falling in love
They take me back to the place
That I love
All of the world is falling in love
The sound of love is in the air
Is everywhere
Et tout le monde tombe amoureux
Lis me ramaint a l'endroit
Que j'aime
Et tout le monde tombe amoureux
Le chante d'amour est dans nos coeurs
Li est partout
All of the world is falling in love
All of the world is falling in love
They take me back
To the place
That I love
All of the world is falling in love
The sound of love
Is in the air
It's everywhere
