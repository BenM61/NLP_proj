I heard these words in my head
Made me think about love instead
Made me think about what could be
Made me shake a little now I'm free

I was in a world so blue
With only visions of me and you
It could have cost me my soul
I could have lost all control

Here I go again
Feelings I can not describe
How did I get here
The walls of my mind I climb
Here I am again
Faces I don't recognize
I got a message

Now I got me searching for my goal
I got me dreaming of rock and roll
Feels like I'm falling free in the sky
Feels like I'm learning now how to fly

Now I got to tear down these walls
Got to run to her when she calls
Got to stand up and be a man
Got to do it 'cause I know I can

I was in a shaky state
I was losing my grip on time
Here all over the place
The walls of my mind I climb

Here I go again
Feelings I can not describe
How did I get here
The walls of my mind I climb
Here I am again
Faces I don't recognize
I got a message

So the journey was full of event
I met you, I met her, I met them
But how could I ever prevent
The escape to my own minds den

I was in a shaky state
I was losing my grip on time
I was here all over the place
The walls of my mind I climb

Here I go again
Feelings I can not describe
How did I get here
Here I am again
Faces I don't recognize
I got a message
I got a message
I got a message
