I'm not the reason you're looking for redemption
You cut some strings and everything will fade away
You tried to use some physical connection
There's nothing left for you to say
By the way

We used to be friends
We used to be inner circle
I don't understand
What have I become to you
Take my good word
Turn it backwards
Turn your back on me
Is it absurd
For me to hurt
When everything else is fading

We used to be friends
We used to be inner circle
I don't' understand
What have I become to you
Take my good word
Turn it backwards
Turn your back on me
Is it a absurd
For me to hurt
When everything else is fading

We used to be friends
We used to be in a circle
I don't understand
What have I become to you
Take my good word (used to be friends)
Turn it backwards
Turn your back on me (used to be in a circle)
Is it a absurd
For me to hurt
When everything else is fading

We used to be friends
We used to be in a circle
I don't understand
What have I become to you
