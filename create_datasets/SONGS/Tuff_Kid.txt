I was a tuff kid
Yeah I was a tuff kid
It took a lot to get me on my knees
I had a hard time
Yeah I had a hard time
Just ask somebody if you don't believe me.

My mama had me
But she didn't get me
I guess I broke her at the age of five
My daddy hit me
But he couldn't quit me
We showed each other how to feel alive

Say hey everybody at the old schoolyard
Took it all the way and we took it hard
Did the kind of things make you feel alright
Said the kind of things keep you up at night.

It was a small town
And it didn't fit me
There wasn't anything that I could do
So I found a guitar
And I took it with me
Just like every single kid I knew.

We say hey everybody at the old schoolyard
Took it all the way and we took it hard
Did the kind of things make you feel alright

Said the kind of things keep you up at night
