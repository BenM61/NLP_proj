Do you come here often
Have we met before
Tell me, your impression now 
Could you like me more

Could you even love me here
Is it too early to tell
Who am I foolin'
When I know too well

That it's only conversation
Here in my mind
Great expectation
The loving kind

I'm losing my patience learning the lines
I've still got to meet him, mm, mm
I've still got to meet him, mm
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Do you like the music, funny
We should meet by chance
Maybe we'll meet later
Have another dance

Suddenly I know you
Yes, I know you well
Could this really happen
Only tonight will tell

If it's only conversations
Here in my mind
Great expectations
The loving kind

I'm losing my patience learning the line
I've still got to meet him, mm, mm
Yes, I've still got to meet him, mm
La, la, la ,la, la, la, la, la
