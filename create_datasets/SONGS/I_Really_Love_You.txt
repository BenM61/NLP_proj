Yeah I really, really love you
Nobody else will do
That's why I love you
That's why, why, why

Yeah I really, really want you
Nobody else will do
That's why I love you
That's why, why, why

Well babe, you know I love you so
I'd praise the world if you could know
But when I see you coming down the street
My heart skips a beat

You, I really, really need you
But then you played me for a fool
Why do you do me like you do, do, do

Well babe, you know I love you so
I'd praise the world if you could know
But when I see you coming down the street
My heart skips a beat

You, I really, really need you
But yet you played me for a fool
Why do you do me like you do
Why do you do me like you do
Why, why
