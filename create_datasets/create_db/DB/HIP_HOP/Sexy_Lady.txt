But every time she out with me she be blowin' reefa
In the coupe looking better than a Mona Lisa
Tunnin' into my songs thinkin' bout features
She know her little nigga spit ether
And them grown dudes really don't know how to treat her
So she rock with me and I roll wit her
Cause I'm a D boy and she's a go Getta
This new girl that I'm poofin' on
Gotta young boy thinkin' bout movin' on
She got her Louis Vuitton bag and the shoes on
Wanna take her to the telly, bust a move dog
See a nigga need more than one

And rolled up the blunt yeah full of bubble gum
Yung bosses all here yeah we got another one

And she the truth if I'm lyin' then I'm dyin' man
