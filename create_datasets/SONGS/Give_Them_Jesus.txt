I want to cross a border line
And walk on dusty floors
Give up two weeks of my life
Feed the hungry, clothed the poor.
I want to drive up to a homeless man
Or holding up a sign
Hand my only twenty
God Bless him as I say goodbye
But more of this

I wanna give 'em hope
I wanna give 'em peace
I wanna give the greatest of these give 'em love-love
I wanna tell the truth and lead them to the light
And tell them everything will be alright
Give them love, give them Jesus

I wanna walk with something with someone
I wanna listen to their pain
Be a shoulder they can cry on
I found they'll never walk away
But more than this
I wanna to change the world
Make it a better place
But is it really
Ready if they never really know
Really know
Real hope
Real peace
Or the greatest of these
Real love-love
