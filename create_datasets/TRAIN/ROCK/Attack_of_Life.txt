Splits your heart at the seams
With the coldness of it all
Feel that life's just a dream
And you lost the ball
Don't cry
Just do it
You think your world's up and down
And you got no place to go
You got your head spinning round
Need your poison just to show
Don't cry
Just do it
Bringing on the attack of life
Bringing on the night, with love
You got yourself in a hole
And you can't get out
Such a shame you lose control
Better turn around
Don't cry
Just do it
Bringing on the attack of life
Bringing on the night, with love
Have you ever stood on the edge
Felt the heat of the sun?
Have you ever stood in the dark
Watch the moon glow?
Have you ever felt the pain from
A shotgun?
Have you ever cried the tears of
The lonely?
From the midnight, with love
Bringing on the attack of life
Bringing on the night, with love
