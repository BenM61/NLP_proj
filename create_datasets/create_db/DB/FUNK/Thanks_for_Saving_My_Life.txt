Thanks for savin' my life
For pickin' me up
Dusting me off
Making me feel like I'm living again (Like I'm living again)

I'm so glad I ran into you
If I hadn't seen you I would have been through
Our love is lucky though
Could not stand anymore
Oh, I could never, never, never, never repay you

I'm so grateful for all of the things you've done for me
Especially listened to my problems, then savin' me from misery

I just wanna say thank you, baby, for savin' my life
For pickin' me up
Dusting me off
Making me feel like I'm living again

I'm so glad you came along
You stopped me from singing that sad, sad song
You're the one who erased the pain
My life would never be the same
You're the very one, the only one that I've been waitin' for

I want to thank you for listenin' to all of my problems
And being my shelter in and out of the storm

I just wanna say thank you, baby, for savin' my life
For pickin' me up
Dusting me off
Putting me all back together, together, together

I can live since I found you, baby
Now I can live since I got you back, baby

I just wanna say thank you, baby, for savin' this man
Don't you understand what you're doin' to me, baby
We both hooked up, we played together
I can't live, I can't live without you, babe, and didn't you, didn't you, didn't you save me babe

I want to thank for saving my life
