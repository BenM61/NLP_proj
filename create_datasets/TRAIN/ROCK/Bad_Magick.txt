Does it feel so bad when you're taking a drag
and when you're looking at the world through tired eyes?
When you stare at it dead and you're giving it head
and all those things you say you love never come alive

If it feels so bad
Bad magick playing off of me
It feels so bad
Oh no, I don't want to be your friend
It feels so bad
Bad magick laying into me
It feels so bad
Oh no, I don't want to hear it again

When you get so high that you're wanting to
die but everything around you is turning green
When you get so low and I know you've been
feeling like a dried out leaf in a summer breeze
I don't like it!

If it feels so bad
Bad magick playing off of me
It feels so bad
Oh no, I don't want to be your friend
It feels so bad
Bad magick laying into me
It feels so bad
Oh no, I don't want to hear it again

I'm getting back, get back on track, get off of my back
I'm getting back, get back on track, get off of my back
Yeah (x3)

I'm getting back, get back on track, get off of my back
I'm getting back, get back on track, get off of my back
Yeah, yeah

I'm getting back, get back on track, get off of my back
I'm getting back, get back on track, get off of my back
Yeah

I'm getting back, get back on track, get off of my back
I'm getting back, get back on track, get off of my back bitch

Back, back, get back on track and get off of my back
I'm getting back, get back on track, get off of my back
Yeah
I'm getting back, get back on track, get off of my back

If it feels so bad
Bad magick playing off of me
It feels so bad
Oh no, I don't want to be your friend
It feels so bad
Bad magick laying into me
It feels so bad
Oh no, I don't want to hear it again

I'm getting back, get back on track, get off of my back
I'm getting back, get back on track, get off of my back
I'm getting back, get back on track, get off of my back
Yeah
I'm getting back, get back on track, get off of my back
I'm getting back, get back on track
