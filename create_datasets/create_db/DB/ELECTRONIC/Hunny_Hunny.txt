Honey honey, how he thrills me, a-ha, honey honey
Honey honey, nearly kill me, a-ha, honey honey
I've heard about him before
I wanted to know some more
And now I know what they mean, he's a love machine
Oh, he makes me dizzy

Honey honey, let me feel it, a-ha, honey honey
Honey honey, don't conceal it, a-ha, honey honey
The way that you kiss good night

Way that you kiss me goodnight

The way that you hold me tight

Way that you're holding me tight

I feel like I wanna sing

When you do your thing

I want my dad to give me away at
My wedding, but according to
Mum's diary I've got three possible
Dads: sam, bill or harry.

Sophie!

Do they know?

What do you write to a total
Stranger?
"come to my wedding, you might
Be my dad"?
No, they think mum sent the
Invitations and after reading this
Diary I'm not surprised they all said
Yes!

Honey honey, how you thrill me, a-ha, honey honey
Honey honey, nearly kill me, a-ha, honey honey

I'd heard about you before
I wanted to know some more
And now I'm about to see
What you mean to me
