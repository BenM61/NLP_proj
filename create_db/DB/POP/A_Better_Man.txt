Open your eyes
Say what you say and I'll listen
For a while

Where is you smile?
The one that reminds me to whisper
Like a child

How can we stay strong?
Now hope is gone

Give me a reason
I can believe in
Help me to be the best I can

Give me a feeling
The love that I'm needing to make me
A better man

Will it be there
The taste that reminds me I missed you
All this time?

You know I still care
I'm walking around in a circle
Like I'm blind

Oh it's been so long
But I'm holding on

Give me a reason
I can believe in
Help me to be the best I can

Give me a feeling
The love that I'm needing to make me
A better man, oh yeah

Give me a feeling
The love that I'm needing to make me
A better man

Give me a reason
I can believe in
Help me to be the best I can

Give me a feeling
The love that I'm needing to make me
A better man
