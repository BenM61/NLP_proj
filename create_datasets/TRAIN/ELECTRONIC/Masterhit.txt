You know me and I sure you 
Everyone

You seem so, tender

Give me some more of the warm little beasts
I'm so fond of

Master, I'm so glad to feel your presence
But you don't seem to share my impatience
I relied upon you to break the silence
I cannot understand your reluctance

Master, I feel so warm and I'm so happy, oh master

Give me some more of the warm little beasts
I'm so fond of

You seem so
I could melt the frozen wall you raised between us
and now I'm on the other side, you seem rather surprised

Constricting viscous rings around your warm body
Holding you tied, holding you tied... and I feel so happy

You seem so tender
As the warm little beasts
I'm so fond of
