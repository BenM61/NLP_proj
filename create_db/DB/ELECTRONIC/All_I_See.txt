I don't even know how I got here
But I know that I don't ever wanna leave
I feel the aura and I feel the atmosphere
The bass is pumping and now I believe

That life is my bass synth, I feel the attack now
That I have a taste there is no turning back
We are moving as one, we align with the stars
I know nothing can tear us apart

There's something taking over my heart
The night is coming out of the dark
It's like there's no one else in the room
'Cause baby, all I see is, all I see is you
Throw my hands up to the sky, let the music take me home
All our senses come alive, let the music take me home
Throw my hands up to the sky, let the music take me home
All our senses come alive, so happy I could die

Heartbeat racing, body losing all control
Baby, you keep my feet on the floor
You take over the rhythm, take over my soul
You be dancing, leave me asking you for more

That life is my bass synth, I feel the attack now
That I have a taste there is no turning back
We are moving as one, we align with the stars
I know nothing can tear us apart

There's something taking over my heart
The night is coming out of the dark
It's like there's no one else in the room
Cause baby, all I see is, all I see is you
Throw my hands up to the sky, let the music take me home
All our senses come alive, let the music take me home
Throw my hands up to the sky, let the music take me home
All our senses come alive, so happy I could die

Don't tell me I don't know you
I don't know you
Remember what I told you
Through these black eyes

There's something taking over my heart
The night is coming out of the dark
It's like there's no one else in the room
'Cause baby, all I see is, all I see is you
Throw my hands up to the sky, let the music take me home
All our senses come alive, let the music take me home
Throw my hands up to the sky, let the music take me home
All our senses come alive, so happy I could die
