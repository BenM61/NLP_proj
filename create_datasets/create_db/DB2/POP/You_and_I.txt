You and I.
Ah, the calm below that poisoned river wild,
You and I.
Tears that dry on a rude awakened child.

Where you look down
I've walked before, burning holes
With eyes of liquid brown.
If we had only known, in a way

We wouldn't reach this ground.
You were my only home, silver eyes.
I want to see you shine.
And we will fell the weight

Fall away from us in time
Searching our past for the true
You and I, you and I, you and I,
All for you.

Where you think you'll fall,
I adore you.
Where you shut your soul,
I will open for you.

If we had only known, in a way
We'd never reach this ground.
I'll know, silver eyes.
I can see us shine.

I said, we will fell the weight
Fall away from us in time
Searching our past for a true
You and I, you and I, you and I,
All for you.
