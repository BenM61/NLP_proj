A heart that's true
There are such things
A dream for two
There are such things
Someone to whisper darling
You're my guiding star
Not caring what you own
But just what you are

A peaceful sky
There are such things
A rainbow high
Where heaven sings
So have a little faith
And trust in what tomorrow brings
You'll reach a star
Because there are such things

So have a little faith
And trust in what tomorrow brings
You'll reach a star
Because there are such things
