I know what you're drinkin' love
Tell me what you're thinkin' of
I know what you're drinkin' love
Tell me what you're thinkin'

I, I'm so blind, I never saw you pull that bottle from your jacket lining
Darlin' you, you're so fly
But all the makeup in the world can't hide the lies

Wine glass woman
Wore your Christian Dior
But you shatter into pieces on the floor
Wine glass woman
See the fire in your eyes
But your victory will be your own demise

I know what you're drinkin' love
Tell me what you're thinkin' of
I know what you're drinkin' love
Tell me what you're thinkin'
I know what you're drinkin' love
Tell me what you're thinkin' of
I know what you're drinkin' love
Tell me what you're thinkin'

I smile, and you wink back
With your Marant Willow sneakers and your backwards hat
Kiss the sky
But you bring back
A hazy cloud that's swirling 'round you where your head is at

Wine glass woman
Wore your Christian Dior
But you shatter into pieces on the floor
Wine glass woman
See the fire in your eyes
But your victory will be your own demise

I know what you're drinkin' love
Tell me what you're thinkin' of
I know what you're drinkin' love
Tell me what you're thinkin'
I know what you're drinkin' love
Tell me what you're thinkin' of
I know what you're drinkin' love
Tell me what you're thinkin'

Around and around
Around and around
We go
Around we go
Around and around
Where will we stop
I don't know
I don't know

Wine glass woman
Wore your Christian Dior
But you shatter into pieces on the floor
Wine glass woman
See the fire in your eyes
But your victory will be your own demise

I know what you're drinkin' love
Tell me what you're thinkin' of
I know what you're drinkin' love
Tell me what you're thinkin'
I know what you're drinkin' love
Tell me what you're thinkin' of
I know what you're drinkin' love
Tell me what you're thinkin'

I know what you're drinkin' love
Tell me what you're thinkin' of
I know what you're drinkin' love

I know what you're drinkin' love
Tell me what you're thinkin' of
I know what you're drinkin' love
