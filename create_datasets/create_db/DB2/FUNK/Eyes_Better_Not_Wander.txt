all day  i've been watching  your ways 
it seems when the ladies walk by  
you're head can't keep from turning  see finally I'm learnin 
oh  no way  not me  i'm not havin that there 
i see  soon we'll be headin our  own ways 
there's no explination for me 
cause you can't be huggin on me  when you're eyes are across the street  oh 

i could care less in how hard it may be 
your eyes better not wander while you're walking next to me 
if she's so fine then that's where you should be 
your eyes better not wander while your walking next to me, oh 

ok, that's it, I'm not feeling like this 
i see, I'm just cramping, your style 
boy don't you walk faster than me 
lemme holla at cha later 
i refuse to be a hater 
go head, get that, you go kick it with her 
don't trip, I'm gonna find me a, new friend 
it's so disrepectful to me 
when you're hangin out with me, but your eyes are across the street, oh 

i could care less in how hard it may be 
your eyes better not wander while you're walking next to me 
if she's so fine then that's where you should be 
your eyes better not wander while your walking next to me, oh 

don't go let em wander wander wander wander wander 

i could care less in how hard it may be 
your eyes better not wander while you're walking next to me 
if she's so fine then that's where you should be 
your eyes better not wander while your walking next to me, oh
