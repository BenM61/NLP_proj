I'm on a mission to search and destroy
Don't get it twisted
I'm ready to make some noise
How could you play me just like a Nintendo
But don't you know that I'm loco
I came to win win win
Better show me what you got
I came to bring the fire 'cause you know I like it hot
Going to win win win 'cause I'm full of tiger blood
I'm vicious like a viper
And I'm ready to turn it on
Work hard, and so we play hard
You wanna go

You know I'm bringing bombastic
I'm feeling freaking fantastic
Turn up the music, get plastic
You know I'm playing like no more mister nice guy
You know I'm bringing bombastic
I'm feeling freaking fantastic
Turn up the music, get plastic
You know I'm playing like no more mister nice guy
I'm coming for you

You got me revving like a Lamborghini
I got you sweating, yeah it better taste so sweet
I know you've heard about my reputation
You're gonna need a vacation

I came to win win win
Better show me what you got
I came to bring the fire 'cause you know I like it hot
Going to win win win 'cause I'm full of tiger blood
I'm vicious like a vibour
And I'm ready to turn it on
Work hard, and so we play hard
You wanna go

You know I'm bringing bombastic
I'm feeling freaking fantastic
Turn up the music, get plastic
You know I'm playing like no more mister nice guy
I'm bringing bombastic
I'm feeling freaking fantastic
Turn up the music, get plastic
You know I'm playing like no more mister nice guy
I'm coming for you

Work hard
Work hard
Work hard
Work hard

You know I'm bringing bombastic
I'm feeling freaking fantastic
Turn up the music, get plastic
You know I'm playing like no more mister nice guy
I'm bringing bombastic
I'm feeling freaking fantastic
Turn up the music, get plastic
You know I'm playing like no more mister guy
I'm coming for you
No more mister nice guy
I'm coming for you
