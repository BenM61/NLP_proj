Oh man, you heard enough
Trying to live a risking life
Don't go out and buy a Cadillac
If you know your money ain't right

Fun is so much easier
When within your mean
If you can't afford caviar
Don't be ashamed to eat pork and beef, yeah

I'm not trying to tell you how to do it
I'm only saying put some thought into it

Be what you are, my friend
And live the life
Be what you are, my friend
And live the life

Just because you made this child
Attend some private school
You try to send yours
Knowing only time will really might able to

Don't try to live like a king, yeah
On a poor mans take
That's one reason there are so many
People are hurting today, Lord

I'm not trying to tell you how to do it
I'm only saying put some thought into it

Be what you are, my friend
And live the life
Be what you are, my friend
And live the life

Don't try to live this high
When you see your boss man do, yeah
Just remember you work for him
And he don't work for you

It was something that you want, oh
And you know you can't afford it
Don't be ashamed to a put a lid down on it
(Incomprehensible) hold it, yeah

I'm not trying to tell you how to do it
I'm only saying put some thought into it

Be what you are, my friend
And live the life
Be what you are, my friend
And live the life

Be what you are, my friend
And live the life
Be what you are, my friend
And live the life

Be what you are, my friend
And live the life
Be what you are, my friend
And live the life

Be what you are, my friend
And live the life
Be what you are, my friend
And live the life

Be what you are, my friend
And live the life
Be what you are, my friend
