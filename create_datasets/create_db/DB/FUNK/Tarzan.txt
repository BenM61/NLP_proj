Oh let me swing down on this grapevine here
I got a girl and she's so fine (yeah)
Make me want to swing from a grapevine
(ain't that strange?)
she doesn't know what a thing she's causing
Got me running round, wanna holler like Tarzan

Here's what I say
Owaowhaowhaohwa outlaw
So fine

Get on down baby

She's got a cheat, you know you can't beat her
She ain't worrying about there being no cheater
She walks the streets, all the cars start pausing
And all the fellas that are driving start hollering like Tarzan

Owaowhaowhaohwa outlaw
So fine

Get on, get on baby
Get crazy
Get out of the way

Wanna holler like Tarzan

She's got a cheat, you know you can't beat her
She ain't worrying about there being no cheater
When she starts walking, all the fellas start pausing
And all get together and start hollering like Tarzan

Owaowhaowhaohwa outlaw
So fine
