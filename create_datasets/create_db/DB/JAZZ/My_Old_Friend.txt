I can recall those warm summer days
No decisions, child's play
Did they slip away?
Gone forever, gone forever
Lost to yesterday

From the beginning you've been
Always there my old friend
True until the end of time

As I walk down, streets full of amber leaves
I see nothing's really changed at all
We're just older now
Still together, still together
After all these years

And from the beginning you've been
Always there my old friend
True until the end of time

My old friend
From the beginning you've been
Always there my old friend
True until the end of time

Still together, after all these years
And from the beginning you've been
Always there my old friend
True until the end of time

My old friend
But from the beginning you've been
Always there my old friend
True until the end of time

My old friend
But from the beginning you've been
Always there my old friend
You've been true until the end of time

My old friend
From the beginning you've been
Always there my old friend
True until the end of time
