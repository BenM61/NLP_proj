Get back up with you (you) girl with you
Oh yeah

Rockin them stilettos
Jumpin up outta that mercedes truck (truck)

It was monique

'Cause shawty right there is a ten, a ten
Shawty you a ten

Need your keys
So waltz on me
Burberry fragance on my shirt from when she
(Oh) me
Hard as a rock from when she touched me
Thinkin now that she would've loved me
What it is, what it ain't, tell me what to do
I know I'm late but destiny brought me back to you
Time went by turned you into a butterfly
So I say hello, tell yo ass goodbye

It was kiesha
It was sonya
It was tonya
It was monique

If she fine, if shawty is a dime 
You should tip her, you should tip her
If she go, and you love her
You should tip her, you should tip her
If she fix you eggs and grits in the morning
You should tip her, you should tip her
Pancakes with the bacon on the side
(You should tip me, you should tip me)
