You see I'm just a man
I'm trying to do all that I can
Don't know why you don't understand
The situations I've been in
They may have been other undercover secret lovers
But you're my main thing (you're my main thing)
I've been trying to figure this out
What this is all about
All we do is fight, scream and shout
There's been days that I lie to you
And did you lie to me too?
Once again (you don't trust me)
I know you can't (I'm not worth it)
I'm not worth it
But I think we've come too far
Girl you know
(They don't like it, she is working it out)
You're my main thing
We'll make it work somehow
What is said and done, it was all my fault
I guess I didn't ever thought
That you would ever put me out
Now I'm trying to walk a line for you
That's what I want to do
Know I wasn't true yeah
Tell me when, when can I talk to me
Show you how I can make it right
You know I really wasn't worth it
A position wasn't right

You see I'm just a man
I'm trying to do all that I can
Don't know why you don't understand
The situations I've been in
They may have been other undercover secret lovers
But you're my main thing (you're my main thing)
