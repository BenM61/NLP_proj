I'd do anything that I'm told to
I'd even mean it if I'm supposed to
Leave me on a little
I go for broke
Leave me on some more
I'd go for the big toke

Everybody's watching oh but nobody cares
Oh wait cause no
Nobody's watching but everybody cares
Oh whatever talk to you later

Look out
Cause I'm just too fake for the world
I know it's just a game to me
I'm just too fake you see
I wish I didn't have to be but watch out
I got too much soul for the world
It's breaking my heart in two
I got too much soul for you
I don't like it but it's true

Get off
I go to church and
I'm expected to be lost soul
They need examples to use
I could stay forever leave right now
It's your call either way
It's time to use my life for myself
(most people just won't tell you that)
I'm gonna use my life for someone else, yeah
No wait wait wait wait

Hurts right?

But I can't even talk to you
About my effect on people
Cause I'm doing the same thing to you
That's right even right now
Oh just wait up for me if you want to but

Oh look out now
I'm just too fake for the world
And there's nothing I can do about it
Yeah I'm just too fake for you
I don't like it but it's true

Look out
I got too much soul for the world
It's breaking my heart in two
I got too much soul for you
I don't like it but it's true

Look out
I'm just too fake for the world
I know it's just a game to me
I'm just to fake you see
I hope you can forgive me

Look out now
I'm too fake
