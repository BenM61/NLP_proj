There's a piece of me you can't have
And I know it's driving you mad
There's a part inside you can't reach
I'm afraid that's the way its gonna be
There's a part of you that wants to fight
But I never really had the appetite
I fear my feelings wont speak
Words are already taken upon the breeze
Wind is always blowing

Pieces falling from me
You can have them for free
Now it felt so complete
Pieces falling from me

Though you try your best you never find
There are pieces that are left behind
Last piece of the jigsaw
While the others are scattered across the floor
So you try to get them all up
There are pieces falling in the dust

There's a pile of ash we don't need
Leave it to be taken upon the breeze
Wind is always blowing

Pieces falling from me
You can have them for free
Now it felt so complete
Pieces falling from me

All this background noise
Its crowded
Never tell
Its half the reason why they're there
Its hard to make another plan

There's a fine line what you want and what you need
Standing right there in between
Never been there
Never

Pieces falling from me
You can have them for free
Never felt so complete
Never be what you need
Something missing from me
That I'll never complete
There the last ones complete
Pieces falling from me
