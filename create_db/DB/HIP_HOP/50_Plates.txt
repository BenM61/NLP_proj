This the realest shit in the streets
Untouchable empire
The only niggas breaking Backwoods was in the Bentleys baby
Believe it
Let's get this motherfucking money

I'm down to fill these empty sacks
I'm down to fill these empty sacks
My little niggas gonna set me straight
My little niggas gonna set me straight
Trying to flip these 50 plates
It's time to flip these 50 plates
This little jewel gonna set me straight
This little jewel gonna set me straight

Chrome wheels on my 68
Double M strong in fifty states
My Mexicans gonna get me straight
But that phone bill it can't be late
Six mil in that interstate
I'm down to fill these empty sacks
Grinding nigga wanna beat this case (Boss)
Gun charge in New York state
Ho niggas up in my face
Painkillers take pain away
Raaa them sticks come, they bang away
Raaa bang, bang, bang anyway

Big wheels on my big V8
F*ck with me you wanna get this cake
Diamonds fill my empty sacks
[These hundred bills just made my day
Strip club is where we meet
Big booty is how she eats
Them f*ck niggas she know they fake
I'm in the club get to flip my pays
My lil niggas gonna set me straight
My lil niggas gonna set me straight
My Cuban blood he got that weight
Tell (?) come get this cake
