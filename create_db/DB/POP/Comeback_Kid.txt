They like to kick you when you're down
They like it better when you're there on the ground
And up 'til now I've never made a sound
Hey, hey
I bet they've never had a broken heart
But they sure know how to beat the hell out of one
Sometimes I think they do it just for the fun
Hey, hey

But no, I'm not leaving, even though I'm bleeding
Even though this nightmare makes me wish I was dreaming
Even though I hate it, I'm gonna take it
Until I win

'Cause I'm a comeback, I'm a comeback kid
Don't know why bad things happened, but they did
I don't think I deserve the hurt I get, but I'm made for it
It's not the end, no, it's not the end
I'm a comeback kid
Down for a minute, I'll get up again
Looks like I'm breaking, but it's just a bend; it's not over yet
'Cause in the end
I'm a comeback, I'm a comeback kid

I'm gonna finish what I started now
You interrupted me with all your doubts
How dare you forget where I started out

Oh oh, oh oh

But no, I'm not leaving, even though I'm bleeding
Even though this nightmare makes me wish I was dreaming
Even though I hate it, I'm gonna take it
Until I win

'Cause I'm a comeback, I'm a comeback kid
Don't know why bad things happened, but they did
I don't think I deserve the hurt I get, but I'm made for it
It's not the end, no, it's not the end
I'm a comeback kid
Down for a minute, I'll get up again
Looks like I'm breaking, but it's just a bend; it's not over yet
'Cause in the end
I'm a comeback, I'm a comeback kid, uh-huh

I believe in what I am, I believe in what I was
I believe in losing you, I've never been given so much
I believe it's been a year, the worst one I've ever lived
I believe I'm better now than I have ever been
I believe that ever since everything went south
I believed in every word that ever came out of my mouth
I believe you missed me, but you don't have to miss me, 'cause
I'm not leaving again

'Cause I'm a comeback, I'm a comeback kid
Down for a minute, I'll get up again
Looks like I'm breaking, but it's just a bend; it's not over yet
'Cause in the end
Yeah, I'm a comeback, I'm a comeback kid
I'm not leaving, I'm not leaving
Not leaving again, I'm not leaving
Not leaving again, I'm not leaving

I'll save you a spot at my big parade
You're all invited on my comeback day
I'll serve you ice cream and lemonade
Hey, hey
