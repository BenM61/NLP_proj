Birth is always painful
Decaying in the womb trapped within this body
A bleeding human tomb
Gutted bitch lies dead emptied of the child

Chewing on the cords
It's life line to this world afterbirth is flowing
The stench is overwhelming
My body growing stronger, my pain turns to torture

Severing it's bloodline, a butchered infant carcass
Meat from the unborn, the freshest kills
Chopped up children bathing in blood
Contoured and festering I rot in disgust

Regeneration of my body, mother ripped apart
Smashing in her face
My knife cutting holes, fucking her remains
Esophagus carved out

Crushing cartilage
Bile oozing from punctures in your liver
Riping meat within, chewing in intestine
Bladder spurting urine, sight of defecation now grow infection

The child ripped to shreds
Drinking its excretions
Zombification ejaculation over mutilation
On the mothers body hacked into pieces

The sludges from my cock gives her life once again
Sewing the remains of the child deep within her
Reborn through evil
My torture known throughout Hell

Heed to his calling, the demons await my next kill
Carnage is my fetish
Body cavities scraped of guts
Brains seeping from cracks as my axe continues to hack
