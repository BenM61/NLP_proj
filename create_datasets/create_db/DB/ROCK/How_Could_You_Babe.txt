So long, my only friend
I guess we gave it a try
And then I guess we tried again
I don't remember why
But nothing's as hard to do
As just saying goodbye
And when love is in the way, you gotta say
"I guess love ain't always right"

And I find out you'd gone and met a new man
And told him he's the love of your life

How could you, baby? (How could you, baby?)
How could you, baby? (How could you, baby?)
Well, how could you, baby? (How could you, baby?)

Well, have you lost your memories?
Did you wash 'em down the drain?
And did you have some help deciding
To forget my name?
Cause nothing I can say to you
Could ever ease this pain
I'm just waiting for the day when I can say
That you are mine again

When I found out you'd gone and met a new man
I felt so lonely that I cried

How could you, baby? (How could you, baby?)
How could you, baby? (How could you, baby?)
Well, how could you, baby? (How could you, baby?)

Well, how could you, baby?
How could you, baby?
How could you, baby?
How could you, baby?

When I found out you'd gone and met a new man
I felt so lonely that I cried, I cried, I cried!

How could you, baby? (How could you, baby?)
How could you, baby? (How could you, baby?)
Well, how could you, baby? (How could you, baby?)
