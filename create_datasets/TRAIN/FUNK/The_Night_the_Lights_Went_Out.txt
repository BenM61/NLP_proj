Where were you when the lights went out
In New York City (I wanna know, I wanna know)
Where were you when the lights went out
In New York City

Don't you know that I was making love
(She was making love)

I remember on the 13th of July
The only light was the light up in the sky
New York had black-out for 25 hours or more
And nobody really knows the reason why

Ooh, somebody called it love down on the socket (The socket)
It was safe to say I went the door to lock it (To lock it)
So I took my lady by the hand
And led her to love me, love me, love me!

Where were you when the lights went out
In New York City (All over the town, yeah)
Where were you when the lights went out
In New York City

Don't you know that I was making love
(She was making love)
Ooh, sweet making love
(She was making love)

Central Park was jammed after dark
Innocent girl from love above the
What the nation's gonna grow in nine months or so
Where we all a little bit baby-boom

Politicians said it was a pity (A pity)
But that was the night they call it love city (Love city)
So I took my lady by the hand
And led her to love me, love me, love me!

Where were you when the lights went out
In New York City (I wanna know, yeah)
Where were you when the lights went out
In New York City

Don't you know that I was making love
(She was making love)
Ooh, sweet making love
(She was making love)

Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, can you remember?

Where were you when the lights went out
In New York City (I wanna know, yeah)
Where were you when the lights went out (Where?)
In New York City

Don't you know that I was making love
(She was making love)
Oh, sweet, sweet love, yeah
(She was making love)

I wanna know
(She was making love)
Have a baby by the hand
(She was making love)

Led her to love me, yes I did
Oh, where were you?
