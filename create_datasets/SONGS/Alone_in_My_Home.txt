This light that shines on me tonight
Turns on when you wander through my door
And your friends won't see you to the end, I'm sure
But you love them anyhow

Lost feelings of love
Lost feelings of love
That hover above me
Lost feelings of love
Lost feelings of love
That hover above me

The ghost that visit me the most, drop by
Cause they know they can find me here
And they claim to be held from me in chains, but come on
They're guilty as sin my dear

I'm becoming a ghost
Becoming a ghost
So nobody can know me
I'm becoming a ghost
Becoming a ghost
So nobody can know me

These stones that are thrown against my bones, break through
But they hurt less as times goes on
And though alone, I build my own home, to be sure
That nobody can touch me now
Yeah

All alone in my home
Alone in my home
Nobody can touch me
All alone in my home
Alone in my home
Nobody can touch me
