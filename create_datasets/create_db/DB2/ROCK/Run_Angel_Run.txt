I follow Angel, but Angel follows the sun 
I follow Angel, run Angel, run Angel, run 

Go your way, have your day 
Right or wrong, sing your song 
But, Angel, take me along 
But, Angel, take me along 

I need you, Angel, and I'll follow you to the sun 
I love you Angel, but run Angel, run Angel, run 

Go your way, have your day 
Right or wrong, sing your song 
But, Angel, take me along 
But, Angel, take me along 
Go your way, have your day 
Right or wrong, sing your song 
But, Angel, take me along 

Please, Angel, take me along 
Please, Angel, take me along 
Please, Angel, take me along
