Was I awake, or was it just a dream? 
I opened up my eyes, and you weren't with me. 
And now you've said that you're leaving but you'll be home soon. 
It's never easy bein' away from you. 
One thought, boy, I'm all choked up. 
There's something about you, I could never ever get enough. 
It's the way that you move. 
It's the smile on your face. 
Breaks my heart in two everytime you go away. 
I always said I'd never cry over you. 
But it's hard to hold back tears when your fears come true. 
I'm sittin' here lonely just a-missin' you. 
Baby, come home... 

Refrain: 
Everytime you go away, my heart goes with you. 
Everytime you go away, my heart's torn in two. 
Is there something I can say? 
Won't you change the plan to make? 
'cause my heart can't stand the pain. 
Everytime, everytime you go away. 
Last night, I was sittin' up in my room. 
I knew I should be sleeping, but instead I was thinking about you. 
I can still hear your voice callin' out my name. 
I just closed my eyes, and you're lying here next to me. 
I always said I'd never cry over you. 
But it's hard to hold back tears when your fears come true. 
I'm sittin' here lonely just a-missin' you. 
Baby, come home... 

Refrain x 2. 

Why do you want to make cry? 
Why do I feel such pain inside? 
I need to know. 
I always said I'd never cry over you. 
But it's hard to hold back tears when your fears come true. 
I'm sitting here lonely, and I'm missin' you! 
Come home! 

Refrain x 2. 

Come home, baby. 
Missin' you when you go away. 
Everytime you go away, I can't stand the pain. 
I can't stand it. 
I know, I know. 
All them days will be perfect. 
Someone stand the pain! 

Refrain x 2.
