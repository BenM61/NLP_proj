What is this going to get us
Where are we headin' in
When do we start to I rye dear
When do we really begin

What is this going to get us
Hanging around till tour
Saying goodnight at daybreak
Kissing goodbye in the doorway

We can go on the way we've gone
I'm at the end of my rope
I can't live on love I've so much of
And I can't keep livin' on hope

What is this going to get us
Only an aching heart
When is this going to get us
Together never to part
