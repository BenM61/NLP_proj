Lord you know what makes a lonely man
All it takes is to be
Racing down where you never be found
Oh don't let me fall that low again
When you're gone that far
Only one things going to get you up

She is the woman with the skull tattoo
Her skin is black and eyes are blue
Takes me to heaven when I think of you
She picked me up in a gutter downtown

Lord know I lost me faith in you
So it goes when you are
Racing down where you'll never be found
Your dark angel spread her wing again
When you've gone that far
Only one thing is going to pick you up

She is the woman with the skull tattoo
Her skin is black and her eyes are blue
Takes me to heaven when I think of you
She picked me up in a gutter downtown
