You quiver like a candle on fire
I'm putting you out
Maybe tonight we could be the last shout
But I'm fascinated by your style
Your beauty will last for a while

You're feeling instead of being
The more that I live on the outside
There's nothing to give
I'm infatuated by your moves
I've got to search hard for your clues

I want to repair your desire
And call it a gift
That I stole from just wanting to live
How I see the vision through your eyes
Your innocence no longer fuels surprise

Trying to outrun your fear
You're running to lose, heart on your sleeve
And your sole in your shoes
Take a left,
A sharp left
And another left, meet me on the corner
And we'll start, again.
