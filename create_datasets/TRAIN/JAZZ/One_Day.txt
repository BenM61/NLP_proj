I feel a little lazy
I gotta make a plan
To live in a hotel
Is heaven and it's hell
I don't know where I stand

My life is but a rumor
They're flying in the press
I'm dating every man
Why can't they understand
My life is not a mess

Even if the words are all untrue
I'll say to them, forever
What is overdue

Don't wait
'Cause when I fall in love
You will see the moon and every star
Declare it from above
One day
The world will feel a spark
Feel it in the day and in the dark
The day it's really love

For now I'm in a prison
That I put up myself
When papers start a fire
They're started by a liar
Who's cryin' out for help

I'll walk out in the lobby
Pout in a photograph
It's one day in the life
But it cuts like a knife
Nobody gets a laugh

Even if the words are all untrue
I'll say to them, forever
What is overdue

Don't wait
'Cause when I fall in love
You will see the moon and every star
Declare it from above
One day
The world will feel a spark
Feel it in the day and in the dark
The day it's really love

When I'm blue
Or feeling sad
I'm immune to anything they do

Don't wait
'Cause when I fall in love
You will see the moon and every star
Declare it from above
One day
The world will feel a spark
Feel it in the day and in the dark
The day it's really love
