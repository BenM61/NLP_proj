There's a new dance called the New Bolero,
At the Savoy;
It's a killer with a new kind o' joy,
It's takin' the town!
Night after night,
While the ickies wonder what it's about,
All the jitterbugs are beating it out,
And swingin' on down.

My my!
Oh how that band can play!
You can see couples sway
To tom tom rhythm.
Take it from me,
That's a New Bolero at the Savoy,
It's a killer with a new kind o' joy,
It's takin' the town!
