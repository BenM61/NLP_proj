You see me drivin' down the street 
I'm just not looking good
I got both hands off the wheel
I got you runnin'
I'm listening to music you can't hear
I got pretty music in my ear

Cause I'm a punkrocker, yes I am
Well I'm a punkrocker, yes I am

I see you standing in the street
and you can't stay on your feet
And your walking in your sleep
right across the street
You can hear me laughing to myself
You can hear the music in my head

Cause I'm a punkrocker, yes I am
Well I'm a punkrocker, yes I am

You see me drivin' down the street
I'm just not looking good
You see me drivin' in my car 
I'm drivin' in my sleep
I'm listening to music you can't hear
I got pretty music in my ear

Cause I'm a punkrocker, yes I am
Well I'm a punkrocker, yes I am
