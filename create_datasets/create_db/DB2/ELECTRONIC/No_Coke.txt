'Cause when I come I come rough
Inna reaggae raggamuffin business
Kom!
Hip-hop reaggae inna dance hall style
Hip-hop reaggae inna dance hall style
Hip-hop reaggae inna dance hall style

2 o'clock on a friday mornin'
Come a gun man
Come a knife man
Knife of a bouncer
Mash of the ears
On the run come a Kings Street
There he way arrested, and tested
And the drugs he had on him
He confested
Mi callin' on the youth in his country
Whole heap of boys
Whole heap of girls
Drug abuse is a dangerous thing
Stay out of drugs and stop
The violence
Inna dis hard time you have
Abuse drug
Listen what 'ya say and hear
My point of view
To much drugs you can
Go mental
Da say Dr.
Alban tellin' everybody
We no want no coke, no heroin
No hasch-hasch, no amfetamin

Cocain will blow your brain
And ecstasy
Will mash your life!
Cocain will blow your brain
And ecstasy
Will mash your life! 

Drug pushing is a serious thing
One time, two time they make a million
Take all the money a run a foreign country
Buiild a big house
Buy a big limousine, Das why I man come
So you for do the right thing
Das why Jah Jah send me
To tell them the truth
Cause is a disgrace
To the human race
Some are flyin' very high
And some are flyin' very low
Could not differenciate
What is right from wrong
Wan't no coke, no heroin

Cocain will blow your brain
And ecstasy
Will mash your life!
Cocain will blow your brain
And ecstasy
Will mash your life!
