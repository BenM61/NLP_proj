I've been looking for a home
I've been looking for a home
But I can't find one
Looking for a home but I can't find one

[Chorus]
Lead me on
Lead me on
Lead me on

I've been drifting here and there
I need a guide to show my way
I've been drifting here and there
But I need a guide to show my way
I've been drifting here and there
I need a guide to show my way

Lead me on
Lead me on
Better lead me on

One of these nights sing you a song
Make you weep and moan
One of these nights I'll sing you a song
Make you weep and moan

Lord lord lord
Lead me on

If my heart don't stop aching
I won't live to see the sun
If my heart don't stop aching
I won't live to see the sun

[Chorus]

I've got a picture in my mind
Of my home so far away
I've got me a picture
Of my home so far away

Carry my burden down to the anvil
Over the mountain and down to the sea
Take my burden over the mountain
Down to the sea
Carry it back over the mountain down to the sea

Still looking for a home
I've been looking for a home
Yeah I've been looking for a home

[Chorus]
