Slow down, you don't need to move
Fall down, you don't have to lose yourself over this

Head up in the clouds
Taking turns to shout
Your words' a melody
Just take some time to breathe
Memories take their toll
Never growing old
But you should cut the thread
Remember when I said that

Bridges could burn for you
Wouldn't you like them to?
I've never seen you get so low
Bridges could burn for you
Wouldn't you like them to?
I've never seen you get so low
I've never seen you get so low

Slow down, darling you don't need to fake it anymore, no
Come round, you know you can work it out again
The line you walk 'cause something's got to give

Head up in the clouds
Taking turns to shout
Your words' a melody
Just take some time to breathe
Memories take their toll
Never growing old
But you should cut the thread
Remember when I said that

Bridges could burn for you
Wouldn't you like them to?
I've never seen you get so low
Bridges could burn for you
Wouldn't you like them to?
I've never seen you get so low
Bridges could burn for you
Wouldn't you like them to?
I've never seen you get so low
Bridges could burn for you
Wouldn't you like them to?
I've never seen you get so low

I've never seen you get so low
I've never seen you get so low
I've never seen you get so low
