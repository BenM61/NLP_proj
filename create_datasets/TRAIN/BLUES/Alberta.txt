Alberta, Alberta, oh, Alberta
Alberta, Alberta, oh, Alberta

I've been gambling all night
And I've lost all of my money
So ride, Alberta, ride

Ride, Alberta, ride
Ride, ride to me

I don't care what time of night
As long as you just treat me right
Baby, and ride, ride to me

Ride, Alberta, ride
Ride, ride to me

You don't need no saddle, baby
You don't need no gun
Baby, just ride, ride to me

Ride, Alberta, ride
Ride, ride to me

I don't care what time of night
Long as you just treat me right
Baby, and ride, Alberta, ride

Oh, ride, Alberta, ride
Ride, ride to me

Oh, saddle up your pony
Put everything you got on him
Baby, just ride, ride to me

Oh, ride, Alberta, ride
Ride, ride to me

I don't care what time of night
Long as you just treat me right
Baby, just ride, ride to me
