A see-saw, I've had it walked again
A see-saw, I've had it walked again
You don't like what you see
You must not care for me

There's really nothin' to it
And that is all I know
There's really nothin' to it
And that is all that I will show, to you

A see-saw, I've had it walked again
A see-saw, I've had it walked again
You don't like what you see
You must not care for me

There's really nothin' to it
And that is all I know
There's really nothin' to it
And that is all that I will show, to you

She creeps me out
She cranks me in again
She creeps me out
She cranks me in again
She creeps me out
She cranks me in again
She creeps me out

She cranks me in again
She creeps me out
She cranks me in again
She creeps me out
She cranks me in again

She creeps me out
She creeps me out
