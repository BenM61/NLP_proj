Deep in my heart there's a fire burning
I need you like a drug
Whoa-oh you keep me wanting
Whoa-oh I've come undone
Nights with you like tunnel vision
Racing through the dark
Whoa-oh heart beating faster
Whoa-oh it tears me up

Ooh ooh
Like an overdose
Baby let's take it too far tonight
You're my favorite high
Ooh ooh
Like an overdose
Thinking I'm crossing the line this time
Taking me for a ride

See your face in my reflection
Whisper more and more
Like a tiger in it's chamber
Clawing lines into my door
Counting down until I see you
To get me through the day
Whoa-oh I know I'm falling
Gonna ride it anyway

Ooh ooh
Like an overdose
Baby let's take it too far tonight
You're my favorite high
Ooh ooh
Like an overdose
Thinking I'm crossing the line this time
Taking me for a ride

Feels like gravity
Takes a hold of me
Lost reality now
Drown myself in these
Painted imageries
I don't wanna come down

Ooh ooh
Like an overdose
Baby let's take it too far tonight
You're my favorite high
Ooh ooh
Like an overdose
Thinking I'm crossing the line this time
Taking me for a ride
