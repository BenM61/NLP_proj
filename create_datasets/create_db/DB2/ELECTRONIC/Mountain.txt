I see the scars from a mad man's knife
Marks on your wrist where he had you tied
You try and tell me it doesn't mean a thing
I hear the sad songs you're left to sing
You thought you could take it, day after day
You're blessed to be able to still walk away
Your mother told you they were dirty old men
They say if you don't play you can't win

You want love, you need love
There's love on the mountain

His hands were folded as if to pray
But he never had any words to say
He walked beside you then and he left you alone
To face the fear that he places in your soul
Prodigal girl, come in out of the cold
Rest your feet before you explode
Prodigal girl, I know you're hurt
I know what they stole
