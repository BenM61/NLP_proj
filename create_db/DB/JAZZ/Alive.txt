I think of all the things we did
Back when we were alive
I watched around the corner
As you rode up on your bike
I sat with you and held your hand
When movies made you cry
I think of all the things we did
Back when we were alive

So many things to believe in
So much room to spread our wings
The joy we found in every little thing

I never will forget the day
You heard your brother died
I'm sorry now I couldn't help more
While you sat and cried
The letters that you sent me
The summer you were gone
I couldn't wait for your return
I couldn't wait that long

Swimming holes to sing in
Open fields we'd go to dream
All the joy we found in every little thing
Every little thing

I think of all the things we did
Back when we were alive
When we made love I held you so close
And kissed you when you cried
I'm sorry that it had to end
I'm sorry you're not mine
I'll be with you until the end
In dreams of you tonight
I think of all the things we did
Back when we were alive
