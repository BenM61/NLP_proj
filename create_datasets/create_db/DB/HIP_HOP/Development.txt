Now, there's a crack on the inside, and i start to play
Now, my fingers stuck, over stood my stay
Now, Now, Now, my world is bent from this development

Moving faster, then a storm's rain after the plaster split, where my fingers fit
Sure disaster and growing faster then my skin can take
At least that's what they say

Now, there's a crack on the inside, and i start to play
Now, my fingers stuck, over stood my stay
Now, Now, Now, my world is bent from this development

Crowded cluster.
Do you trust her to take the weight, or make the change?
Abandoned labor
Do yourself a favor and do for you, not what you're used to

Now, there's a crack on the inside, and i start to play
Now, my fingers stuck, over stood my stay
Now, Now, Now, my world is bent from this development

No more sanity
I can't stay here, too many bad choices
No more space to breathe
I can't stay here, too many damn voices

Now, there's a crack on the inside, and i start to play
Now, my fingers stuck, over stood my stay
Now, Now, Now, my world is bent from this development
