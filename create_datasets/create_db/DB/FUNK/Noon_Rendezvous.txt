I've been wondering what 2 wear
I love our noon rendezvous
I know U tell me U missed me
And I want 2 make love 2 U

Your words, they intoxicate me
I shiver each time that U speak
How much more can I endure, my love?
The sound of your voice makes me weak

If my bodily functions operate
This way when U just call my name
I'd hate 2 see when we are finally
Playing that nasty love game

Your words, they intoxicate me
I shiver each time that U speak
How much more can I endure, my love?
The sound of your voice makes me weak

The words are all over your face, my love
What shall U or shall I do?
U could show me some new tricks, my love
I'd love 2 be taught by U

I've been wondering what 2 wear
I love our noon rendezvous
