My daddy told me that boys may say some things that aren't true
Well, they promise me the sweet things that they never intend to do
You say your love is strong
And you'll never do me wrong
(But let me tell you that...)

My daddy told me to open up my eyes and not be blind
Every time I look at you, everything you do seems so fine
I love you so, but I'll have to let you go
Unless you get out and get a job (get out and get a job)
Get out and get a job (get out and get a job)
I'm gonna wait till you pass the test

'Cause my daddy knows best (daddy knows best)
My daddy knows best now
(He doesn't want me to make) no no no no no no
(The same mistakes) no no no no; he says
Romance without finance can be a nuisance
(Need your lovin' but my daddy told me)

Yes he told me that our love is fine
Oh but don't let it mislead you
'Cause daddy also said that love is blind
While you're in poolrooms, you should be in schoolrooms
And get out and get a job (get out and get a job)
Get out and get a job (get out and get a job)
I'm gonna wait till you pass the test

'Cause my daddy knows best (daddy knows best)
No, don't care what you say
We've got to do it his way
Don't say that he's mean
I have to tell him everything
