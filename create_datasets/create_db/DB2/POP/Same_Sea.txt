Goin' the distance, every occasion
Headed for somewhere out of the way
Movin' and shakin' every persuasion
Keepin' us out there, caught in the waves

Try to wander in the deep
Just waitin' for the tides to meet

And when the currents take us out again to opposite oceans
Out of the hands of safety
From the solace to the deepest end
Places we break and bend
You're the one in it with me
No matter how far we get
Oceans we are in still connect
And when the currents circle back again
They'll carry us with them to the arms of the same sea

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

Isn't it all just part of the nature,
Piece of the business, part of the view
Physical labor, human behavior,
It's an illusion I'm passin' through

No place to stand or set my feet
Just waitin' for the ends to meet

And when the currents take us out again to opposite oceans
Out of the hands of safety
From the solace to the deepest end
Places we break and bend
You're the one in it with me
No matter how far we get
Oceans we are in still connect
And when the currents circle back again
They'll carry us with them to the arms of the same sea

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

The tides were carried in, the lakes they take us out
They come around again and bring me back to you

When the currents take us out again
From the solace to the deepest end
They'll carry us with them to the arms of the same sea
To the arms of the same sea
To the arms of the same sea
To the arms of the same sea
You're the one in it with me
In the arms of the same sea
