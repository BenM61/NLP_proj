Blank face, Tre 8
Kill everybody, f*ck an AK
Sell narcotics and step my dollars up to Bill Gates
Push all limits, you lookin' timid, need to back off
Punk ass cops, them crackers want us with our black off
Thug life nigga since '96 I wanted to gang bang
Few years later I'm really from it
We were still kids
Crack off nigga, I'm squeezing empty till the shell break
F*ck my image I need to drop
I need to, blank face
Cause brain damage from my mechanics, keeping two ways
Sell narcotics, I'm slanging diamonds with your pack then
Stack large commas, you with your riders with your backbone
Can't fold figures, I make deposits with the gold grin
Jeans look dirty, I lift the Chevy with the rims on
All bad bitches they wanna f*ck me with the cap gone
Real life nigga, I'm in the stu' till all the weed blown
Wait long, long, I hid the dope behind the cellphone
Y'all don't hear me, I want the money right
Ugh, Groovy Tony, no face killer
I see the money right, ugh
Yeah, I'm blank face

Clear everything out the safe
Crack the pig bank
Robbin' your kids too
My heart an igloo
The devil in all blue
Die now go to heaven or bring 'em through
Lot of brown 'round here
Got that white girl for you
And she swimming in fire water, could be double digits
Pistol through your Civic
Most die before they hear it
Turn a nigga to a spirit
Drive slow, oh, hey
Hit the curb with shattered mirrors
Look around now you're hellbound
Boogie down, bullshit I won't allow
Slang a bird every hou'
Smack a nigga with the heat
Contradicting, now you peace
Leave you triple six laying in defeat
Can you dig it?
Struck a match, they won't finish
Drop a nigga off, get a nigga whipped
Squeezing fingertips, aye
