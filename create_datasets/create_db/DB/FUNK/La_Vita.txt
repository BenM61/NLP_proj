Funny how a lonely day,
Can make a person say:
What good is my life
Funny how a breaking heart,
Can make me start to say:
What good is my life
Funny how I often seem,
To think I'll find another dream
(Or to think I'll never find a dream)
In my life Till I look around and see,
This great big world is part of me And my life

This is my life
Today, tomorrow, love will come and find me
But that's the way that I was born to be
This is me
This is me

This is my life
And I don't give a damn for lost emotions
I've such a lot of love I've got to give
Let me live
Let me live

Sometime when I feel afraid,
I think of what a mess I've made of my life
Crying over my mistakes,
Forgetting all the breaks I've had In my life
I was put on earth to be,
A part of this great world is me
And my life
Guess I'll just have to score,
And count the things I'm grateful for In my life

This Is my life
Today, tomorrow, love will come and find me
But that's the way that I was born to be
This is me
This is me

This is my life
And I don't give a damn for lost emotions
I've such a lot of love I've got to give
Let me live
Let me live

This is my life
This is my life
This is my life
