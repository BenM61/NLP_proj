A taste of breath, a kiss sweater than honey
Your eyes in a misty dream a million miles away
And in my ear you whisper my name
Just like in some old news flash
From light years ago

Van Dyke's on the slide trombone
Through the smoke of the party room
Your teeth like the ivory coast
Start singin' my favourite song
And it happen' to be mood indigo

Mood indigo
I just go weak when I hear mood indigo
Could last for weeks until I decide to wake up
Take off my make up

Holding on to my heart
Smokin' them downhill
In a room number thirteen
Tryin' to stretch my luck again
Down the corridor your footsteps echo against the wall
My man of mystery, my date with infinity
Tonight I'm gonna sacrifice, for the first time in my life
Make it all come back to me, like an old forgotten dream

Van Dyke's on the slide trombone
Through the smoke of the party room
Your teeth like the ivory coast
Start singin' my favourite song
And it happen' to be mood indigo

Mood indigo, I just go weak when I hear mood indigo
It could last for weeks until I decide to wake up
Completely lost in my mood indigo
