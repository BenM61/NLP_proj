You say its because we're boisterous
You hate us 'cause we got our dignity
There's a difference between the two of us
It's a sense of morality and what corrupts
We stand together so proud and strong
This is a place where we belong

We got loyal friends
We keep our heads held high,
We'll stick together you and I
Don't need no guns or no drugs on our streets
just a place to go and the boots on our feet.

Young skinhead they call you hooligan
Just because you don't make any sense to them
You're a hardworking man whose paid his dues
But they still call you racist on the evening news
But the blood that runs right down your wrist
Don't come from a knife, but the cuts on your fist

Your torn up knuckles and faded blue jeans
Are the colors you wear and the life that you've seen
You tell the truth look people in the eye
Don't live your life in no baggy disguise.

Never alone,
The city streets are where we roam.
Never alone,
This is Boston it's our home.
Never alone,
The city streets are where we roam.
Never alone,
This is Boston it's our home.

Don't need no gang to watch my ass
Just loyal friendship and a pint of Bass
In the midst of the chaos and insanity
I'm a member of the working class society
We'll sweat in the ring and bleed in the streets
But our will and spirit can never be beat

You can shoot and you can kick but together we'll stick
Through thick and thin not stick or stone
Can break the bond that has here grown
Arm and Arm We Fight As One.

Never alone,
The city streets are where we roam.
Never alone,
This is Boston it's our home.
Never alone,
The city streets are where we roam.
Never alone,
This is Boston it's our home.

Never alone,
The city streets are where we roam.
Never alone,
This is Boston it's our home.
Never alone,
The city streets are where we roam.
Never alone,
This is Boston it's our home.
