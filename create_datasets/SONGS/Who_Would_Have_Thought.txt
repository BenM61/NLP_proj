Nobody told you
That a heart is like a deep, deep freeze
So many lies so much of it broken

Nobody told you
Deep within a well so cavenous
That maybe I could shed some light on

Who would have thought
It could be amazing?
Who would have thought
The tiny courageous?
Who would have thought
That love so belated
Could save me
And bring me back to you?

Nobody told you
There'd be days of silence that no one heard
A river swells and overwhelms you

And nobody told you
Deep within a heart so ravenous
That maybe I could spare a beat for

Who would have thought
It could be amazing?
Who would have thought
The tiny courageous?
Who would have thought
That love so belated
Could save me
And bring me back to you?

I had to find you, had to let you know
That you aren't all alone, yeah
We didn't make the rules
I had to find you, had to get right back
To you

I had to find you, had to let you know
That you aren't all alone, yeah
We didn't make the rules
I had to find you, had to get right back
To you, it's always been you

Now tell me

Who would have thought
It could be this amazing?
Now, who would have thought
The tiny courageous?
Tell me, who would have thought
That love so belated
Could save me
And bring me back to you?
