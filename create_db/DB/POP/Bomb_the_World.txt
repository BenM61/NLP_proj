please tell me the reason
behind the colors that you fly
love just one nation
and the whole world we divide
you say you're "sorry"
say, "there is no other choice"
but God bless the people them
who cannot raise their voice 

(chorus)

we can chase down all our enemies
bring them to their knees
we can bomb the world to pieces
but we can't bomb it into peace
whoa we me even find a solution
to hunger and disease
we can bomb the world to pieces
but we can't bomb it into peace

violence brings one thing
more more of the same
military madness
the smell of flesh and burning pain
so I sing out to the masses
stand up if you're still sane !
to all of us gone crazy
I sing this one refrain

(chorus)

and I sing power to the peaceful
love to the people y'all
power to the peaceful
love to the people y'all
