Maybach Music!

Swimmin' in women, champagne sippin',
Gold Emblem with 2 M's in it, this living is so magnificent, stop dreaming it,
I'm living it
(Oh I), I can show you, (Oh I) show you better that I can tell you, (Oh I) I can show you,
(Oh I), (Oh I)

I'm tha magnificient with tha sensational style,
far from bein' shallow cause she caught me wit a smile,
try to figure out my style,
baby that will take a minute but if all we got is time,
you can't be actin' timid, so we back to playin tennis,
we been goin' back and forth,
she the one that I adore, so I tried it in aurar,
conscience intervened concentrating on my cream, I'm tha king,
make a move, pawns all tha way to queens,
I'm a don, I'm a boss, I'm a profit, I'm a g,
I'm a CEO which means that I profit off of me (Yea!).
All white T's still rockin' my Nike Airs, fresh outta flight school,
cause I'm fly right? (Yea!)
Ain't nothin free, I'm chargin'to breathe air, if it's not a Maybach,
really who da hell cares?
My money long, my nigga my money strong,
if you ain't gettin' money dat mean you done somethin' wrong (Boss!)

I'm tha magnificient with tha sensational style,
down to all of my automobiles wit no miles, yellow corvettes,
black rally stripes, and I never phone ahead,
all she do is hear the pipes, project bitches, upscale kittens,
f*ck her for a minute then now we countin' digits,
Maybach money so I always had a vision,
I would always tell ma niggas but... ain't nobody listened.
Words work magic, haters wreak havoc,
there ain't nothin'on my back but the delicates of fabrics.
I made a transition from the thieves,
to the biggest executive Def Jam's ever seen.
Only yours dream, Sean John suit and a S. Dot ring,
Sean Don for my crew, bad hoes in pursuit,
Masspike on a two, Gunplay he a glue goon wit a attitude (Holla!)

I'm tha magnificient with tha sensational style, when I decorate a home,
marble flooring like Da Nile,
nigga you a clown, here's the number you should dial,
ye start wit 305 but we end at 4 pounds.
Stop at ... old pound, for life is a ??, all them Carol City killers,
feel liking you broke down,
money is a must tommy guns on a bus, Allan Zamren on the case,
so you know what you can suck,
wear red all the time but really I'm colour blind,
wanna catch my attention nigga, throw up a dollar sign.
One time for tha Crips, young g's buyin cribs and I smoke wit Vice Lords
when I visit Mississip.
The game never change, money still a focal,
but its time to rape tha game like Puffy did Total,
like Rev Run in the tub still smokin', in memory of Shakir,
Boss gotta shout Oakland!
