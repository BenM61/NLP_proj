Today we will be discussing... Love
(I don't think you hear me though)
Is there anyone.. (I don't think you hear me though)
Is there anyone.. (I don't think you, I don't think you)..
Anyone...in love?

[Hook]
I should of known better than to be out here f***in' with you
Knowin' the s*** you do
I should of known better than to be out here f***in' with you
All that s*** you took a n**** through
I told myself that everything would work out fine
(I f***ed 'round and hit it)
F***ed around and slipped and hit that p**** one mo' time
(I f***ed 'round and hit it)
And got caught up in something that's worse than drugs
I'm a motherf***in' fool for love.

And I'm just a (just a) just a (just a)
A motherf***in' fool for love.

[Verse One]
Man, I was sure I had Ms. Perfect
I was settling down
Through f***in' round
Most the time I stayed at her house

Spent all my time, with her when we stayed in the town
Thought this s*** right here was really bout to work out
Quickly found out, that wasn't her intentions
Shorty phone used to ring e're five seconds

Ain't pay attention 
She would always take her calls in the kitchen
Go to the sink, runnin' water like she washin' dishes
Ain't tryin' a listen

I know how them shorties is
Always in somebody business
Gossipin', shootin' bulls*** with her girlfriend
One day feelin like a joker 

Told her I wasn't comin over
Jive got me on the last flight out to Arizona, what I told her
Went over unexpected
Rung the bell (ding dong!) Domino's (just a second!)

Opened the door with the robe on
She only put on, when she naked as the day she was born
I'm just standin' there with crossed arms
Then her baby car came out

Lookin' at me like ("N**** wha's wrong?!")
Wha's wrong?!?

[Verse Two]
If I ain't just get outta prison, 
Man listen, I'd a did him
By Kentucky Fried Chicken, and the n****, I ain't' bulls***tin'
Glad I had my man with me

He fast, turned me around
Pulled me out the house
To the car, n**** we out
I'm madder than a muhf***er, heart tore up

Lookin for a clip to dry this off the side of (whoo!)
Man I caught him in the house wit' my girl
Damn 'cause that s*** was f***ed up
F*** her,.... just like the rest of 'em

I'm a tell ya somethin', I can't front
We been broke up for a couple of months
And I done called her up we talked
I ain't mad as I was

She ain't doin no mo' than I done
Ya know?, just got caught wit her's
Hit me right here when she told me she still had my stuff
(want me to bring it?) can you stay when you come?

(uh huh) DAMN!

[Verse Three]
Sheeeit, I ain't a sucker 'cause
S***, I can't help that I love her
My baby got some good stuff
I'm coo-coo for coco puffs

Time to break out the candles
And old Marvin Gaye
Huh, let me straighten up
Aw, you know what?

Hmmm, lemme call her back
Where I put her number at?
Ain't it 757-23..yeah, 36
See if she want some fish

I can fix it 'fore she get here
Man, I hope my boo ain't left yet
Aw, come on, come on
Know you on the other line an' s***

(Hi Derek!) Derek!?! what the..? (Pablo?) B****!!
