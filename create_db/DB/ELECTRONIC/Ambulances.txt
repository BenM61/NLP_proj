If I should ever let you go
I'll never want to know oh why
If I should ever let you go
I'll never want to know oh why

Inside the sudden loss of air
Impressions in despair oh why
Oh why the slightest whispering
As pistol sirens ring goodbye

And at first you never get the chance
To let him know
Listen to them now how we loved you so
The first time the last time
A life time ago

Following you
We're calling you
It's time to go

If I should ever let you go
I'll never want to know oh why
If I should ever let you go
I'll never want to know oh why

Following you
We're calling you
It's time to go
