You're so bad your never gonna take it
Too bad no one's gonna stay here
It's too hard to be like everyone else is
Come here cause I could probably stay here

Now, to be free
A new house of disease
It's too hard to be free
Take everything you need
It's too hard to be free
Take what you want from me

I watch the world and they can fake it
Pictured now I'm never gonna break it
It's too hard to be like everyone else is sir
What you want? What you gonna make it?

Now, to be free
A new house of disease
It's too hard to be free

Don't want to be the only boy
Cause I don't want to be nothing left destroyed
Don't want to condensed and never take it
I'm here just to see you fake it
Cause I sit by the window and watch you destroy it
The shit you breed is the world I mourn in
Cause it's too goddamn hard to f*ck your mother
Cause I'll take your world and watch you destroy it

Now
To be free
And new house of disease

It's too hard to be free
It's too hard to be free
This time
