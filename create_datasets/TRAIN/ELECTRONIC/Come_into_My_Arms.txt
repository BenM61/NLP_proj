The other night when we kissed 
You told me I was yours forever 
But when I woke up the next morning, you were gone 
Come back baby 
Come into my arms 

You, you showed me how love could be 
Just show me how much you need 
You've always been by my side 
Oh, baby that's no lie 
'Cause I, I've always been true to you 
I've always loved one, that's true 
Oh baby, can't you see that it's you 
You know that I love you so 

Come into my arms baby, I know how you feel 
Come into my arms baby, this love for you is real 
I've always been too much for you it burns inside 
To wake up in the morning and you're not by my side 

You, you shared your thoughts with me 
You shared your secrecies 
And oh, how that makes me feel 
Listen baby, lets be forever 
'Cause I, I know I will always be good 
I know in my heart I should 
I'll never ever do you wrong 
My love for you is strong 

Come into my arms baby, I know how you feel 
Come into my arms baby, this love for you is real 
I've always been too much for you it burns inside 
To wake up in the morning and you're not by my side 

You were not by my side 
Why aren't you here 

We, we can't just let this die 
You gotta give our love a try 
Oh please be by my side 
Don't even begin to cry 

'Cause I, I'm waiting to be with you 
Just give me the chance to prove 
That I'm the only one for you 
You know I was the one 

Come into my arms baby, I know how you feel 
Come into my arms baby, this love for you is real 
I've always been too much for you it burns inside 
To wake up in the morning and you're not by my side 

You were not by my side, your not by my side 
Why aren't you here 
So please be by my side 
Please be by my side 
Come into my arms baby, I know how you feel 
This love for you is real 
It burns inside 

I know you're sorry you did me wrong 
But until then I'll remember 
You'll be back, back into my arms
