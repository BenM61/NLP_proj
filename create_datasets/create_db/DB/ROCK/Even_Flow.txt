Freezin'  rests his head on a pillow made of concrete  again
Oh  Feelin' maybe he'll see a little betters any days
Oh  hand out  faces that he sees come again ain't that familiar
Oh  dark grin  he can't help when he's happy he looks insane

Even flow
Thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh  he don't know
So he chases them away
Someday yet he'll begin his life again
Life again
Life again

Kneelin'  looking through the paper though he doesn't know to read
Oh, prayin', now to something that has never showed him anything
Oh, feelin', understands the weather or that winters on its way, yeah
Oh, ceilings, few and far between all the legal halls of shame

Even flow
Thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know
So he chases them away

Someday yet he'll begin his life again
Whispering hands, carry him away
Him away, him away
Yeah!
Woo
Oh yeah yeah

Even flow
Thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know
So he chases them away

Someday yet he'll begin his life again
Whispering hands, carry him away
Him away, him away
Yeah!
Woo
Oh yeah yeah
