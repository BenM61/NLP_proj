Here I am
Just an ordinary man
And my virtues are few
And I'm amazed
Every morning when I wake
With a lady like you

You're all the good things God put on this earth
And you're so much more than I deserve
And what did I ever do to win a lady like you

Look at me
I'm as common as can be
But do you make me shine
And look at you
You're a lady through and through,
So gracious and kind

And when you sleep, it's always by my side
I look at you and I'm mystified
And what did I ever do to win a lady like you

Heaven knows I'm less than perfect
And I have found the very best
But it's a mystery how someone like me
Was chosen to be blessed with a lady like you

You're all the good things God put on this earth
And you're so much more than I deserve
And what did I ever do to win a lady like you
A lady like you
