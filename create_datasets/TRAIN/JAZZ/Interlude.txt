A corner of the world
A moment out of time
Two people chance to meet
How bitter sweet
How sublime
And clinging there a while 
To gaze across the years
And hope the sun that sets
Brings no regrets
And no tears
And the farewell bow
The lingered kiss goodbye
And who explains the how
And why
These are memories for our time
Two think an escapade
A fly by night affair
Became an interlude
That I've perused
Everywhere
