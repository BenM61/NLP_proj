Everything you love turns to dust, 
You'd make more of it but you felt rushed, 
By all that's periphery, 
You held tight, but on the contrary, 

The trick to life is not to get too attached to it, 
The trick to life is not to get too attached to it, 

You'd kill for answers but learn to live with, 
Questions, Who what why how and if, 
I'll sit back detached tear our your hair, 
Oh but on the contrary 

The trick to life is not to get too attached to it, 
The trick to life is not to get too attached to it, 

Everyone you love turns to dust, 
You'd jump off the edge but you felt pushed, 
By all that's unnecessary, 
You tread but you're off on the wrong foot, 

The trick to life is not to get too attached to it, 
The trick to life is not to get too attached to it, 
The trick to life is not to get too attached to it, 

Don't get attached to, attached to life, 
Don't get attached to, attached to life, 

The trick to life is not to get too attached to it, 
The trick to life is not to get too attached to it, 

Don't look your life passed you by, 
'Cause you're too attached to it, 
Don't look your life passed you by, 
'Cause you're too attached to it
