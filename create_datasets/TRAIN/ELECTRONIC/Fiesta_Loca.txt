Stand up, 
Come on, 
Right now
I wanna be your sunshine, so right, tonight. 
We really ought to stand up, 
Come on, right now, 
Lets get it started, 
Fiesta loca, fiesta loca. 

Being out, all night, lets go... 
Baby tell me, do you wanna? 
A night to remember... 
You've got me burnin' 
You've got me burnin' up... 
You give me fever. 
Going on all night, 
I won't play with fire 
God can only know, here we are again... 
It's the point of no return, 
I've got a dirty mind... 
Come get me baby, but now... 

Stand up, 
Come on, 
Right now... 
I wanna be your sunshine, so right, tonight. 
We really ought to stand up, 
Come on, right now, 
Lets get it started, 
Fiesta loca, fiesta loca, 
Fiesta loca, fiesta loca, 

Fiesta, fiesta, fiesta, fiesta

Going on all night, 
I won't play with fire 
God can only know, here we are again... 
It's the point of no return, 
I've got a dirty mind... 
Come get me baby, but now

Stand up, 
Come on, 
Right now... 
I wanna be your sunshine, so right, tonight. 
We really ought to stand up, 
Come on, right now, 
Lets get it started, 
Fiesta loca, fiesta loca, 
Fiesta loca, fiesta loca, 
Fiesta loca, fiesta loca. 

Fiesta, fiesta.
