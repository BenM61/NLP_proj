Don't judge me mama
Don't tell me that I've done wrong
It's a hard business
It's a hard business to make it on your own

Don't judge me papa
If I can't handle the things in my head
Because it's a hard business
Such a hard business walking on the edge

I got nothing and no-one in my life
So how can I lose again
Got my feet in muddy water
But I'm gonna find that road again

So I'll be taking care of business
'Cause I know what I'm looking for
Oh I've been working every hour God gives to man
But I still see the same closed door

I've got nothing but trouble in my life
But I feel I've got a lot to give
Every day I try to build a new world
But I've had no-one to build it with

Oh I've been looking for a woman to share my hopes
But I know I ain't a patch on you
And I've been thinking that a woman's God's gift to man
Are you thinking the same way too

So don't leave me mama
Don't make me go on alone
Because it's a hard business
Yes it's a hard business, oooh

Don't leave me papa
When my belief in myself is gone
Because it's a hard business
Such a hard business

Tell me, it's a hard business
Being on my own
