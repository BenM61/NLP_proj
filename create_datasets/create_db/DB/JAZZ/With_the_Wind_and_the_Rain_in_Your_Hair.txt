Last night we met 
And I dream of you yet
With the wind and the rain in your hair

I held you tight
And you whispered "good night"
With the wind and the rain in your hair

Now it will be my favorite memory
That vision of you standing there

Oh, there in the mist
How you sighed when we kissed
With the wind and the rain in your hair

Now it will be my favorite memory
That vision of you standing there

Mm, there in the mist
How you sighed when we kissed
With the wind and the rain in your hair
