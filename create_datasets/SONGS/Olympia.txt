It's on the charts
It's on the way the top OK
Run fast, breathe hard, Hoo!
It's just a game we play here!

It's in the charts
The is moving up but
Work out, move on, Hoo!
It's just a game we play here

It's a little bit of this and that
And it's in your heart

Look sharp, dull doll, Hoo!
It's on the way the top, OK
Come clean and you'll see
It's just a game we play here

It's in the charts
The song is moving up, but
It's hard the charts, Hoo!
It's just a game we play here!

It's a little bit of this and that
And it's in your heart
