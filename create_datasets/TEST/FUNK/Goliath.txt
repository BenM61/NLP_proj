Your many days on the moon
Hidin' from humanity
But the man

There's a giant on the loose
Sends a shadow on the land
He's pickin' up the whole of New York City
In the palm of his hand

Got one foot in the West
One foot in the East
Watch out for that monster
Cold corporate beast

Goliath, hey
Will set you free
To go crazy in the 20th century
Goliath
Goliath will set you free
Goliath
Take a long side
Take that walk
On the money side of the street
Goliath
Dancin' with the lead, yeah

The ground starts to shake
When he starts walkin'
And all the politicians listen
When his money start talkin'
When he says stop, we stop
Go, we go, dance, we dance
All the way from London to Tokyo

When he says fast, go fast
Slow, go slow, dance, you dance
All the way from China to Mexico
Do you hear me?

He's got the big reef far and wide
He's to the sugar cane, the acid rain
He's got the hi-tech, the OPEC
And the Cold War

Maceo, wind it up
Maceo, hit 'em where it hurts
In the pocket, yeah
The fat rat
The fat rat
Reminds me of Tom and Jerry

Makes me feel insane
Money
Money
Fallin' into ruin, baby

Now stand back and when you need me
Let the children play
God gave us the heart to make it right
And walk free in the light of the day

Goliath, ow
Will set you free, wow
To go crazy in the 20th century
Say it now
Goliath
Take a long side
Take that walk
On the money side of the street
Goliath
Goliath will set you free
I want to know

When he says stop, we stop
Go, we go, dance, we dance
All the way from London to Tokyo
Wait a minute
If he says jump, you jump, fall, you fall
Dance, you dance, all the way from kingdom come
To kingdom home

Goliath
Goliath will set you free 
Goliath
You might as well walk
'Cause I ain't doin' the talk
Goliath
I got so mad
Goliath
Stop him
Stop him
Goliath
Stop him
Stop him
Goliath
Stop him
