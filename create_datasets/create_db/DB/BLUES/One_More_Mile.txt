Oh you know it has been such a hard hard journey, I don't have to cry no more
Keep your light up burnin', so I can know the score
I got one more mile, oh you know I only got one more mile to go
Oh you know my journey was so hard,
But I don't have to worry 'bout you no more

Oh you know they tell me that thousands of school kids, every one have a mate
The little girl that I love, she the richest in the state
I got one more mile, oh you know I only got one more mile to go
Oh you know my journey has been so hard,
But I don't have to worry 'bout you no more

Oh you know I made a mistake for gamblin', I betted my money wrong
I was bettin' on my baby, but she weren't even at home
I got one more mile, oh you know I got one more mile to go
Oh you know it has been such a long journey,
But I don't have to cry 'bout you no more
