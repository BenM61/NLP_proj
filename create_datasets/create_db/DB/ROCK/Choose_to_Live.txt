This is the face God gave me,
And this is the face I will use.
It cannot leave me, but I wondered if I could:
Walk around and stare it out.

No use saying maybe when your thoughts are driving you crazy.
Choose your life. 
Choose it well.

Dream denial well I never understood it.
If it feels good tell me, why can't I do it?
Look myself in the eye.

No use saying maybe when your thoughts are driving you crazy.
Choose your life, choose it well.

Where's my time? 
My time is now.
So when you find it, don't put it down.
Let the music take you around. 
The fire in you has a right to burn,
So don't let anyone put it out.
Choose to live.
