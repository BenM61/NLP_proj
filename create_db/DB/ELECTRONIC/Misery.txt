I cry myself asleep tonight 
cause I can not hold you tight 
I wish I could see you tomorrow 
To take all this sorrow 
When I touch you 
Can you feel it 
When I need you 
Can you give it 
When I look in your eyes 
Can you see me 
When I fall 
Will you catch me 
Catch me 
Catch me 

CHORUS 
Misery is what I feel, 
When you're not around, 
So I can heal, 
Misery is what I feel, 
Is what I feel, 
Is what I feel 
Misery is what I feel, 
When your not around, 
So I can heal. 

These tears on my face 
Are for you 
I wish that I could 
Hold you, touch you, feel you 
I'm waiting can't you see 
I wish you could hold me, touch me, feel me 
When I touch you 
Can you feel it 
When i need you 
Can you give it 
When I look in your eyes 
Can you see me 
When I fall 
Will you catch me 
Catch me 
Catch me 

REPEAT CHORUS TWICE
