How can it be we're here with you now?
You've made our dreams come true
You've helped them us put us here
For that we are so sincere

About the love that we'll have singing for you
The moment we came on stage
Somehow we always knew
That we've been waiting for you

Tell me why
Does it feel so incredible?
Where the light
Shine on me, it's so beautiful

We've been searching
For all of our lives
All the love that you all provide
And you're all that we need
You're incredible
You're incredible

Look at our fans screaming like that
Look what you've given us
The life that is now complete
For us this is such a treat

Day and day out singing for you
The moment we came on stage
And we'd only heard of love
Till you showed us what it was

Tell me why
Does it feel so incredible?
(Why does it feel?)
When the light
Shine on me it's so beautiful
(Beautiful)

We've been searching
For all of our lives
(Our lives)
All the love that you all provide
And you're all
(And you're all)
That we need
(That we need)
You're incredible

Don't you be scared to follow
Your dreams, they'll come true
Listen to your heart
And you'll get through

Tell me why
(Tell me why)
Does it feel
(Does it feel)
So incredible?
(So incredible?)

Where the light
(Where the light)
Shine on me
(Shine on me)
It's so beautiful
(It's so beautiful)

We've been searching
For all of our lives
(Our lives)
All the love that you all provide

And you're all that we need
This is wild, this real

And your love's all I feel
You're incredible
You're incredible
Yeah, yeah
You're incredible
You're incredible
