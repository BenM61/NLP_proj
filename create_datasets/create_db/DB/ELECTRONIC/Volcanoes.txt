I drew chalk around the eyes of the one I love
Decorated his body and the ashes of the future
Bring a tear of he
From the new tribe
We are
From the new tribe
We are
From the new tribe
We are
I drew chalk around the eyes of the one I love

I can't wait till angels move their feet on the street below
And their eyes burn brighter than the food of the gods
I can't wait till angels move their feet on the street below
And their eyes burn brighter than the food of the gods

Bring a tear of he
From the new tribe
We are
I drew chalk around the eyes of the one I love
From the new tribe
We are
Decorated his body and the ashes of the volcanoes
I drew chalk around the eyes of the one I love
From the new tribe
We are
Decorated his body and the ashes of the volcanoes
I drew chalk around the eyes of the one I love
Decorated his body and in the ashes of volcanoes

Dibuje con cenizos los ojos de mi amor
Decores el creupo con cenizas de futuro
Calo primotivo de una tribo nuevo somos somos
why tu angels antiguos moven los pies bajo les calles
Los ojos prian intensimente con el fruto de dioses
Decores el creupo con cenizas de vocanoes
con cenizas de vocanoes
con cenizas de vocanoes
con cenizas de vocanoes
Dibuje con cenizos los ojos de mi amor
