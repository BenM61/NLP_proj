Yeah I was burning tread on a Ford flatbed before I ever turned sixteen
There ain't a Daisy Duke girl in this country boy's world that ain't called my shotgun seat
That liquor store with the cash only drawer looked past my fake ID
They say everybody knows everybody, but they sure as hell know me

In that map dot town, 65 south bound in the middle of Tennessee
Yeah, I left black marks on every turn too sharp like Bo Duke in General Lee
With all the hell I raised on these Cheatham County lanes, left some 'Church on every street
Every field, every road, every copperhead in Copperhead Creek
Shoulda named it after me

Sprayed my last name with some Burgess paint on a broke down train downtown
Been covered up with some rain and some rust but damn it still stands out

In that map dot town, 65 south bound in the middle of Tennessee
Yeah, I left black marks on every turn too sharp like Bo Duke in General Lee
With all the hell I raised on these Cheatham County lanes, left some 'Church on every street
Every field, every road, every copperhead in Copperhead Creek
Shoulda named it after me
Shoulda named it after me

Let's start this Sunday morning, sun shining right down
Up here in Cheatham county, yeah, we have a 'Church now
I'm gonna go tell y'all what, y'all better gather round
You've got the legend with the future, ain't it right now
We'd use some country boy spitting a little game on 'em
When you read the history books I bet you'll see our name on 'em
Sing, 'Church
