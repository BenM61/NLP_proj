Lay by me, wrapped in evergreen
Catching stars to keep
Feel my quiver seize

Since we found out that we're invincible
We've been living in a dream world
Since we decided to be infinite
There's no ending and there's no fear

I was filled
You made my bones still
Your eyes well with tears
We're alive, my dear

Since we found out that we're invincible
We've been living in a dream world
Since we decided to be infinite
There's no ending and there's no fear

(No fear, no fear, no fear)
(No, no, no, no, no fear)
We've been weak, we've been down
(No fear, no fear, no fear)
(No, no, no, no, no fear)
Kicked ourselves to the ground
(No fear, no fear, no fear)
(No, no, no, no, no fear)
Only lost to be found
You're my hero now

Since we found out that we're invincible
We've been living in a dream world
Since we decided to be infinite
There's no ending and there's no fear

(No fear, no fear, no fear)
Ahh
(No, no, no, no, no fear)
Ahh
(No fear, no fear, no fear)
(No, no, no, no, no fear)
Ahh
(No fear, no fear, no fear)
(No, no, no, no, no fear)
Ahh
