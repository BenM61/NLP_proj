I flash back and think about
The time I first found you
You took me in just as I was
And made me feel brand new
And though it wasn't long ago
At times it's hard to believe
It really actually happened
I let you get to me

Without a doubt
I've had my doubts
Without a doubt
I finally found out
I remember oh so clear
When you came here in my heart
In my heart

When I get lonely
I remember that old me
And doubt if I can keep it up
Till I go back and see
The first time that you found me
You must have known love well
Or maybe you were love itself
At the time I couldn't tell

Without a doubt
I've had my doubts
Without a doubt
Now I finally found out
I remember oh so clear
When you came here in my heart
In my heart

Without a doubt
I've had my doubts
Without a doubt
I finally found out
I remember oh so clear
When you came here

Without a doubt
I've had my doubts
Without a doubt
Now I finally found out
I remember oh so clear
When you came here
