I gotta love
I want to give you 
Much
Tell me

Bass
Love I want to give
Drop it
Bass

Drop it
Come get it gal
Whatever you want
Do do do do do do do do...

Your place or mine
Tell me what will it be
I've got something I would like for you to see
Trust me now

It won't take much time
I got something I want to leave on your mind
I gotta love
When you walk through that door

Kick off your shoes
Take off that dress I got a treat for you
Don't be afraid
Baby don't be scared
Can I touch your body or can I touch you there

[Chorus]
I gotta love
I want to give
If it's too much
Baby just tell me
I gotta love
I want to give
If it's too much
Baby just tell me

Check it out girlfriend
Yeah yeah yeah
Your sexy voice
Really turns me on

You've given me no choice
It's got to be done
How do you want it
Simple or complex

Gimme all you got
I just want to be sexed

I gotta love
I want to give you
Much
Tell me

Love I want to give you
Much
Tell me
Yeah yeah yeah

Drop it on em

If it's too much

Baby just tell me

I want to give
If it's too much
Baby just tell me

DeVante, break it down
(DeVante's rap)

I take that it was fun
'Cause I didn't hear any complaints
I hope it was so good
Til it made you insane

I gotta love
If you should ever get bored
And you need some more
Come see me anytime
You're always welcome through my door

I gotta love
I want to give you
Much
Tell me

Love I want to give you
Much
Tell me

Bass
Yeah yeah yeah
Drop it on em
Aaah I gotta love

If it's too much

[Chorus: x 2]

Break it down one more time for me baby
I gotta love
Bass, bass, bass
Do do do do do you want it baby

Bass
Do you want it baby

[Chorus]
