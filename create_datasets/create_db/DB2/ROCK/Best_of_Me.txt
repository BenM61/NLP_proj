What do you get when you've got the best
The best woman in this wild, wild west
She's got me smiling from coast to coast
A year from now were still goin' for broke

It's such a feeling, never gonna stop (gonna stop)
Ya got me spinnin' like a top
You know there's places where I haven't been
But I'll be back here to do it again

Ya said you wouldn't see me til' you got your wedding dress (wedding dress)
Your like no other, so under cover, I'll never see again

Oh no please don't leave me standing here alone (you got the best of me)
Oh no, please don't keep me hanging on too long, you got the best of me

Me and you baby we wont, make a sound
That's what we do when there's no one around
It's not like we are gonna live in the past
Remember they said it wouldn't last
Unlock the door and throw away the key (wait and see)
I want them to see that you're with me
I'm not a liar and I don't care
I wanna make you play truth or dare

You said you wouldn't be with me til I cleaned up my mess (cleaned up my mess)
Your like no other, so undercover, I'll never see again

Oh no please don't leave me standing here alone (you got the best of me)
Oh no, please don't keep me hanging on too long, you got the best of me

Just think it over, when you think about it, you better think of me

Oh no please don't leave me standing here alone (you got the best of me)
Oh no, please don't keep me hanging on too long, you got the best of me
Oh no please don't leave me standing here alone (you got the best of me)
Oh no, please don't keep me hanging on too long, you got the best of me
