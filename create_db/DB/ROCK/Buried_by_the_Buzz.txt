I got a sweet tooth
Sunk in a soft spot
That busts my jaw loose
And makes my mouth rot
And I caught a bad break
The same one you caught
That turned your hair white
And choked your breath off

So I'm buried by the buzz of a year gone numb
I'm buried by the buzz of a year gone numb
I found gossip in the ivy and it's been swallowing my house
And I found bones in the foundation that I'm just picking out now
So I'm buried by the buzz of a year gone numb

I've got a fistful of shattered seashells
That scream like soldiers stuck down an oil well
I saw a bad sign lit up like Broadway
And I watched my head spin
And I heard my voice shake

I'm buried by the buzz of a year gone numb
I'm buried by the buzz of a year gone numb
I found trouble in the ghost town 
That I've been building with my hands
But I found comfort in the snowstorm 
That I've been piling on my past
So I'm buried by the buzz of a year gone numb

So I'm buried by the buzz of a year gone numb
I'm buried by the buzz of a year gone numb
I see symptoms of a sickness 
In every stranger on the street
And I see danger in the distance 
Speeding straight for you and me
So I'm buried by the buzz 
I'm buried by the buzz
I'm buried by the buzz
