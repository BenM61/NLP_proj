Ruler of my heart
Driver of my soul
Where can you be?
I wait patiently
My heart cries out
Pain inside
Where can you be
I wait patiently
When you're alone
The going gets rough
Come back, come back, come back
I've had enough
Make me a queen
Happy again
Hear my cry
Please, my king

When you're alone
The going gets rough
Come back, come back, come back
I've had enough
Make me a queen
Happy again
Hear my cry
Please, my king
