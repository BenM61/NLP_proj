In these times of troubles, toils and stress
We'll always be safe by doin' what we do best
Playin' our music, well, that was born down in our souls
Bringin' people happiness, oh Lord, it's our only goal

And no matter if we win or lose
We gonna keep the family groove
Hey now, the family groove
Hey now, yes

We play our music for everybody's pleasure
It's our heritage, yeah, now, it's our children's treasure
Can't begin to tell you just what it means to me
I know when we play our music it sets my soul free

And no matter if we win or lose
We gonna keep the family groove
Yeah, the family groove
Yeah, now, the family groove

The family groove
Listen now, the family groove
Oh Lord, the family groove, yeah
I know, when we gonna keep the
Family groove, yeah, yeah

This is our story, yeah, this is our song
You know we get along by keepin' each other strong
Someone is always there, yeah, to hold and comfort me
Well, there's nothing more blessed than a happy, happy family

And no matter if we win or lose
We keepin' our family groove
The family groove, yeah
Family groove, yeah, now
