Some things are basically beyond the vision of doubt
Some things I understand that I'm better off without
Like dingy walls painted clean
Broken words unseen
I said maybe the world's as it should be and you disagreed
Bolder than Paradise and longer than goodbye
I carry your name around with me
Like a wish I sometimes untie 
Wide open spaces and amber waves of grain
That's where I used to live
In the kingdom of my youthful reign
Before I was a prisoner to the silo
Walled into the shadows
Shy to the sky 
Bolder than Paradise and longer than goodbye
I carry your name around with me 
Like a spell I sometimes let fly
