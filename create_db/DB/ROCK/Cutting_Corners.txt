London is grey 
But it's great in it's way, If you're just barrelling through
You find some first class boiler 
And she boils your cares away
Now life is a gas, but the laughs never last, 
So you add a handful of blues
And that's a first class ticket if you wanna get away

'Cause if you hang around the greys and browns, They'll just bring you down
Well it's a useless rap 
You got to cut the crap
Go directly to the things that matter to you

[Chorus]
Have to cut corners or fade away, Have to cut corners or fade away, Have to cut corners or fade away,You know you Have to cut corners or fade away

Going through channels in ties and grey flannels, Just slows everything down, 
And when I want a thing, I want it right away
Going straight for the heart, 
Tears your wardrobe Apart, 
But it wears the other guy down
I may look a mess but I'm dressed to get my way

'Cos if you hanging around the greys and browns, 
Just bring you down
Well it's a useless rap 
You got to cut the crap
Go directly to the things that matter to you

[Chorus: x2]

"London town is pourin' in the rain
And there's nothin' you can do to ease the pain
So you take a ferry over to France
You cant understand a bloody word they say
So you think sod it I'll ignore these bleedin' foreigners
Then some jobsworth says
"I'm teribly sorry sir but you cannot do that unless you go through proper channels"
And I say
Leave it out mate gimme the keys and I'll drive it home meself"

[Chorus]
