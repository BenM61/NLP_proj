Can you feel the beat within my heart?
Can't you see my love shine through the dark?
Can you feel the beat within my heart?
Can't you see my love shine through the dark?
Can't you see that you must be a part
Of that beat in my heart? That beat in my heart

After all that we've been through
I can't seem to face the fact that boy I'm losing you
I threw away your ties through those venetian blinds
I looked and saw my heart just over ruled my mind

And I tried not to let it show now I don't know what to do
I tell myself I'm lying so let's just not let it go
My heart does double beats for you, oh

Now you know my love won't grow cold
Oh this love will turn to gold if we stay in love
Oh, my love, my love, my love

Can you feel the beat within my heart?
Can't you see my love shine through the dark?
Can you feel the beat within my heart?
Can't you see my love shine through the dark?
Can't you see that you must be a part
Of that beat in my heart? That beat in my heart, that beat

[Incomprehensible]

It's like trying to touch the sky but overlook the sun
That's why reality keeps telling me that you're the one
Just the very thought of you gets me aroused
I can feel my heart beat right through my blouse

And darling I tried not to show now I don't know what to do
I tell myself that I'm lying so let's just not let it go
My heart does double beats for you, baby
And I hope you feel the same 'cause I do know for sure, baby
That sure as my name oh baby I know that you're the cure

Now you know my love won't grow cold
Oh this love will turn to gold if we stay in love
Oh, my love, my love, my love

Can you feel the beat within my heart?
Can't you see my love shine through the dark?
Can't you feel the beat within my heart?
Can't you see my love shine through the dark?
Can't you see that you must be a part
Of that beat in my heart? That beat in my heart, that beat

That beat, that beat, that beat, that beat
That beat, that beat, that beat
Can you feel the beat?
Can you feel the beat?
Can you feel the beat?

I can run you say I'm here and this is my idea to care
Well I do myself care that make you feel that you're still there
[Incomprehensible]
But I want to do is just ask you, tell me can you feel the beat?

Can you feel the beat?
Can you feel the beat?
Well, can you feel the beat?
Can you feel the beat? Talk to me

Now you know my love won't grow cold
Oh this love will turn to gold if we stay in love
Oh, my love, my love, my love
We've ever been to my heart, ever been to my heart, yeah
Oh my love we've ever been to my heart, ever been to my heart
And love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love

Don't stop, one more time

Now you know my love won't grow cold
Oh this love will turn to gold if we stay in love
Oh, my love, my love, my love, my love, my love
My love, my love, my love, my love, my love
