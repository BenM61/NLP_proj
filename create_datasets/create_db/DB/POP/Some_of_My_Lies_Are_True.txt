Say you want to be a friend of mine 
See me all the time 
You don't care what I do 
But it all sounds the same to me 

Hey, can't you see 
It's just like I told you 

I know you think that I've 
Been stringing you along 
And that I've told you a few but 

Sooner or later when you say I love you 
You're gonna realize that 
Some of my lies are true 

I never told you that I was the one 
Said it just for fun 
You know, you knew it too 
So why so much on the telephone 
I'm never home 

It's just like I told you 
Because it's real the way you used to make me feel 
It makes it so hard to say 
But nothing can change the way I feel today 
Don't you see that 

Sooner or later when you say I love you 
You're gonna realize that 
Some of my lies are true 

Because it's real the way you used to make me feel 
It makes it so hard to say but 
Nothing can change the way I feel today 
Don't you see that 

Sooner or later when you say I love you 
You're gonna realize that 
Some of my lies are true 

Sooner or later when you say I love you 
You're gonna realize that 
Some of my lies are true
