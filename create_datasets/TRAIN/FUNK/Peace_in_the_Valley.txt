Oh, there will be peace in the valley, one day
There will be peace in the valley for me, I'll pray
Oh, no sadness, no sorrow
No more trouble, there will be
There will be peace in the valley for me

Whoa, you know the bear will be gentle
You know the wolf's gonna be so tame
Mighty lion, you will lie down with the lamb
Oh yes
I know the horse from the wild
Will be led by a little child
And I'll be changed from this creature that I am

Well, o well, o well, o well, o there will be peace, child
In the valley, for me
One day, o there will be peace, child
In the valley, for me
I pray
Oh, no more sadness, no sorrow
No more trouble, there will never be
There will be peace, in the valley
For me

O, there will be peace, child
In the valley, for me
One day, whoa, there will be peace, child
In the valley, for me, one day
Whoa, no sadness, no sorrow
No more trouble, there will never be
Yes, there will be peace, yea in the valley
Yea for me
