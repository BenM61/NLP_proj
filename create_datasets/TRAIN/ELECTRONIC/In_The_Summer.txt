In The Summer summer, camma camma to the fama
como como, yo cama cama

Big or small, I do it all
Little or tall, I do it all allez allez allo alone
it's on, on.
Ebb or flow, I do it all,
High or low, I do it all allez allez allo
allo, hallo,

In The Summer, say me, something bad baby
Say me suttin bad when the sun shining
Come on
Show me something wrong beybey.
Show me suttin wrong in the summertime

In The Summer summer, saccamma camma to the fama
como como, yo cama cama

Cos it's like a dream
Show me something bad
Show me something wrong in the summer
Cos it's nothing bad everything okay
The world is like a dream in the summertime baby, baby, baby
Everything is like a dream
way the sun is shini-ing

I hear a noise, I put a spell, I put a coin,
In to the wishing well.
You make a point, I make a yell,
I am alive I make a yell into the wishing well.
Wishing a spell into the wishing well
Wish a spell into the wishing well
Til I'm under a spell, under a spell a wicked spell
From Hell

In The Summer summer, saccamma camma to the fama
como como, yo cama cama
