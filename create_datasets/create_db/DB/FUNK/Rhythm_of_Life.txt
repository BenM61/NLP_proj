Climbin' every mountain, always killing me
Count the cost as days go by 
Monday I've got Friday on my mind
Why don't we make love
Instead of making plans.

Mother Nature, Father Time
Maybe it's the family of man
Angels cry when they hear that tune
It's sleepless nights for the man in the moon

And it's the rhythm of life
My mind's made up
Lucy's sign is a Chinese dragon
Oh, oh, she's got luck
The rhythm of life is the force of habit
Oh, oh, the rhythm of life.

Give the girl a future
Give her what she needs
Teach her life's a Iong flat road
Maybe she'll have better luck than me
Works so hard like he's still in school
His pockets are jammed, but this man's a fool.

Within the rhythm of life
My mind's made up
Lucy's sign is a Chinese dragon
Oh, oh-oh, she's got luck
The rhythm of life is a force of habit
Yeah-yeah, oh, the rhythm of life
Rhythm of life.

Oh, when out of sight is out of mind 
Shut your mouth, I'm doing fine
Mama's goin' back in time.
