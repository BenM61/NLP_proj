Yeah I was right there - like the "littlewife"
I was everything that you need - always in line
I was living you-loving you-filling your desires
But that was then-this is now-look me in the eyes 
Oh oh oh oh - if love could choose sides
Oh oh oh oh - it's taken mine (so) 
Get over yourself-goodbye
It must be hard to be you -yeah
Living in your life
I was always the one to cry
Now everything-everything-everything is all right
Get over yourself-know why
Cause without you see i do anything i like
Sometimes i stay out all night
And everything -everything-everything is all right 
This just can't be it i kept telling myself
And every magazine said was me was on the shelf
I was givin out giving in giving way my dreams
While you put it in put me down now i found my self esteem and 
Oh oh oh oh you won't get me back
Oh oh oh oh think i overact (well) 
Chorus 
So now you want to talk
Say let's do it just once more for luck
Like old times make up
Better yet just forget better get over yourself 
So stay in touch
When you learn a few things about love
Until then wake up
Better yet better get better get over yourself 
Get over yourself goodbye
It must be hard to be you yeah
Living in your life
I was always the one to cry
Now everything everything everything is all right
Get over yourself know why
Cause without you see i do anything i like
Sometimes i stay out all night
And everything everything everything is all right
