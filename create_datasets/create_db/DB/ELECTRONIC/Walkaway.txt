There's a river of tears I need to cry.
Been holding back for years.
There's a mountain so high I need to climb.
To wipe away the fears.

Solitude and loneliness
Have been a friend of mine.
As I'm turning my back on emptiness.
I leave them all behind.

Who knows
Just where I'm going.
Does tomorrow belong to me.

Walk away this time with my head up high
Walk away just me and myself.
Walk away with pride nothing left to hide.
But it just feels right to be one
And just walkaway

I could never forget how hard I tried.
When we were oh so young.
Just one tender moment I cannot find.
Well maybe I had none.

Strength will be by my side.
Although I feel afraid.
But I know it's too late for this goodbye.
There's nothing left to say.

Who knows
Just where I'm going.
Does tomorrow belong to me.

Walk away this time with my head held high
Walk away just me and myself.
Walk away with pride nothing left to hide.
But it just feels right to be one
And just walkaway this time.

One day you'll realize
That the tears you saw in my eyes.
Will be there forever.

Walk away this time with my head up high
Walk away just me and myself.
Walk away with pride nothing left to hide.
But it just feels right to be one
And just walkaway

Just walkaway
And just walkaway
