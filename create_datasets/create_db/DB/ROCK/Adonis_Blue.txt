I'll give myself a vision for a boy for this one girl. 
He can be the colors of a paintbox set in a black and white world. He'll be a bit of everything, be the silver in the clouds. 
Be a whisper silent as a kiss or a scream that's just as loud. 
I know he can be found. 

Adonis Blue 
Adonis Blue. 
Sad like me but he's always smiling. 
You can't find me. 
I can't find you. 
You're tried and true. 
It's only you 
Adonis Blue. 

He'll be the stroke of midnight or the morning's faithful rise. 
Be the music buried in the garden of a church like the loveliest surprise. 
I heard there isn't anyone, that the breed has long been gone. 
I'm still not sure that I'm convinced 
Gonna try to prove them wrong. 
Gonna look and look and look hard and long. 

Adonis Blue 
Adonis Blue 
Sad like me but he's always smiling. 
You can't fool me. 
I can't fool you. 
You're tried and true. 
It's only you 
Adonis Blue.

Wish upon a star, pull the petals from a flower. 
Make a special wish when the clock strikes certain hours. 
Blow out the candles on the cake, 
Pitch the pennies in the fountain. 
God speed him to me. 
I promise I'll be good. 
I'll be waiting by the window, 
I'll be sitting in the dark. 
He's just gotta be there 'cause I've looked so very hard. 

Adonis Blue
Looked so very hard
You can't find me.
I can't find you.
You're tried and true.
It's only you.
Adonis Blue

Adonis Blue
He's a boy come true. 
He's a little bit of him, 
A little of you. 
Cherub face with those dug in heels. 
He's everything I mean, he's everything I feel. 
Rag doll singing in the slippery city rain, 
Plugging in my circuits. 
Dancing in my brain. 

Adonis Blue 
He's a boy divine. 
Gonna to try to find him. 
Gonna make him mine. 

You can't find me.
I can't find you.
You're tried and true.
If I only knew
Adonis Blue

Give myself a vision
