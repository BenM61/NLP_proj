A masquerade...
You walk in the moonlight
Don't like the shade
You live with the seatide
You luke like Nostradamus
Although you're not as famous
Your pace is fast and nervous
You can't stop
Lunatic and aristocratic
(there you go)
Lunatic and your eyes are magic
Lunatic and aristocratic
(there you go)
Lunatic and the strange is logic
You take a chance
Two fiches on red nine
(he) Let's have a dance
(she) Yes darling...next time
You are no Casanova
You're just a lonely number
You're ill with sexomania
You can't stop
Lunatic and aristocratic
(there you go)
Lunatic and your eyes are magic
Lunatic and aristocratic
(there you go)
Lunatic and the strange is logic
