My heart is black, and my lips are cold 
Cities on flame with rock and roll 
Three thousand guitars they seem to cry 
My ears will melt, and then my eyes 

Oh, let the girl, let that girl, rock and roll 
Cities on flame now, with rock and roll 

Gardens of nocturne, forbidden delights 
Reins of steel, and it's alright 
Cities on flame, with rock and roll 
Marshal will buoy, but Fender control 

Let the girl, let that girl rock and roll 
Cities on flame now, with rock and roll 

My heart is black, and my lips are cold 
Cities on flame with rock and roll 
Three thousand guitars they seem to cry 
My ears will melt, and then my eyes 

Let the girl, let that girl rock and roll 
Cities on flame now, with rock and roll
