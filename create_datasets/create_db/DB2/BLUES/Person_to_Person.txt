Come on home
Don't write no letter, 
Don't even telephone 
I want you person to person, 
Bring your own fine self on home 

Don't sent me no message, 
You know that I'm all alone 
I want you person to person, 
Bring your own fine foxy self home 

Ain't no use to telephonin' me 
I can't love no telephone 
All the time you're telephonin' me 
You could be coming home, ooh baby 

Ain't no use to sent no letter, 
I can't hold no paper tight 
Ain't no use to sent no message, 
it can't talk to me all night 

Now it no use send your brother
I ain't gonna talk to no one else
Ain't no use send your mother
You've just got to come home yourself

Little girl I have someone since you been gone
I want you person to person, 
Bring your fine foxy self on home
