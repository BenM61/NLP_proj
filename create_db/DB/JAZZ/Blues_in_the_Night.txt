My mamma done tol' me,
When I was in knee pants,
My mamma done tol' me, "Son!
A woman'll sweet talk, and give ya the big eye,

But when the sweet talkin's done,
A woman's a two-face,
A worrisome thing who'll leave ya t' sing
The blues in the night"

Now the rain's a-fallin'
Hear the train a-callin' "whoo-ee"!
(My mamma done tol' me.)
Hear that lonesome whistle

Blowin 'cross the trestle, "whooee,"
(My mamma done tol' me.)
A whooee-a-whooee,
Ol' clickety clack's a-echo-in' back the blues in the night
(Hum---)
My mamma was right, there's blues in the night
