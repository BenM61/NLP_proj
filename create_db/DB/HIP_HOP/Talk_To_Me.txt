What must I say to you
To get inside your head
Why must you always think
I want to get in your pants

And why I always gotta be
The closest thing to wrong
Sometimes the only thing a brother need
He need a woman to be strong

Well I ain't cryin', I ain't cryin'
Done 'bout run out of tears
But you're the closest thing to heaven
I need you to be near

Hear me darlin', hear me darlin'
I can't make it more clear
The only thing that's gonna get me through
Is if I got you right here 

[Chorus] 
Ooo girl, talk to me
You're the only one that comforts me
My only reality is I want you for my woman
Ooo girl speak to me
Let me hear you sayin' that you're
stayin' with me
I know my reality is without you
I ain't nothin' at all 

Why does everything I say to you have
to be suspect
Feel like the only way I'll get with you
Somethin' blows off my head

Well I ain't tryin' to go out like that
I want to keep myself clean
Sometime the only thing a brother need
He need the strength from his queen

I ain't lyin', I ain't lyin', done 'bout
run out of time
The only time I want to do right now
Is feel you by my side

Hear me darlin', hear me darlin'
I can't be more sincere
The only thing that's gonna get me through
Is if I got you right here 

[Chorus]

Well I said everything's gonna be all right
When you stand by my side
Gonna work things out tonight
We're gonna make out just fine
For once I'd like for you to be
The one who has the faith in me
And I promise I won't
let you down this time 

[Chorus]
