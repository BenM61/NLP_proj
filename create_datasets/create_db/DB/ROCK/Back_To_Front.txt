On cheap returns to summer places
Awayday herd, all out in the heat
Kicking black looks in sunshine faces
A race to vote with their feet
Back to front

Flock off to find someone to play with
He's not like us he must be done
Buckets and spades to make your day with
It hurts so good it must be fun

[Chorus]
And it's "Made in London town
Fists are up to knuckle down
Because we are the boys who've got the noise and clout"
And it's argue upside down
Black and white and wrong way round
Infight, outright, uptight, downright, inside out
Back to front

Fight on the beaches and back home streets
Welcoming in with outclenched hands
Standing on others with your own feet
You've got to prove that you're a man

[Chorus]

I glance over my shoulder
As they head for the past
But I've still got my eyes up ahead
I'm not going back to front

Back to front
Back to front
Back to front, upside down, inside out, wrong way round
Back to front, upside down, inside out, wrong way round
Back to front
