Different pubs, same name, kids out in the rain
Drain on society, nothing on the telly
Barely at school, acting like a fool
Well, I could've done well if things had gone better
Slurred singing, wrong lyrics on the dancefloor
Not rich, not poor, what you living for?
Poundland pubs and Wormwood scrubs
Last night's takeaway in Tupperware tubs
I lost my job in Wetherspoons
And since that day my bank has hit zero
Hopefully things'll pick up next year though
And if they don't, then well

It won't be long
Before I sign on
Is it right or is it wrong?
I've got no money, it's all gone
It won't be long
Before I sign on
Is it right or is it wrong?
I've got no money, it's all gone

Every week do the lottery, daylight robbery
Spend more on tickets than it's worth in the long run
Young, dumb, living off mum
Waiting for the right time to come
Can't afford the bus that I used to run for
Lurking on the wrong side of the law, what for?
Once more, never been abroad
A week around here's enough to make you crazy

It won't be long
Before I sign on
Is it right or is it wrong?
I've got no money, it's all gone
It won't be long
Before I sign on
Is it right or is it wrong?
I've got no money, it's all gone

All my shoes have holes in the soles
Live my life in second hand clothes
All my shoes have holes in the soles
Live my life in second hand clothes

It won't be long
Before I sign on
Is it right or is it wrong?
I've got no money, it's all gone
It won't be long
Before I sign on
Is it right or is it wrong?
I've got no money, it's all gone

It won't be long
Before I sign on
Is it right or is it wrong?
I've got no money, it's all gone
It won't be long
Before I sign on
Is it right or is it wrong?
I've got no money, it's all gone
