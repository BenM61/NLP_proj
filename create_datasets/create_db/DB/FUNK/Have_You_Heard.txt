Have you heard
Who's kissing her now
Do you think she's blue
Did she say we're through
Has she found someone new

Have you seen
The way she looks now
Does she act the same
When she hears my name
Does she say who's to blame

My arms are empty
My nights are long and lonely
I miss her so (miss her so)
Each new tomorrow can only bring me sorrow
I love her so

Have you heard
Of their wedding day
Rumors come and go
Still I'd like to know
If it's true won't you tell me
