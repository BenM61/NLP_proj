When you are in love
It's the lovliest night of the year
Stars twinkle above
And you almost can touch them from here
Words fall in to rhyme
Any time you are holding me near
When you are in love
It's the lovliest night of the year
Waltzing along in the blue
Like a breeze drifting over the sand
Thrilled by the wonder of you
And the wonderful touch of your hand
And my heart starts to beat
Like a child when a birthday is near
So, kiss me my sweet,
It's the lovliest night of the year

When you are in love
It's the lovliest night of the year
Stars twinkle above
And you almost can touch them from here
Words fall in to rhyme
Any time you are holding me near
When you are in love
It's the lovliest night of the year
Waltzing along in the blue
Like a breeze drifting over the sand
Thrilled by the wonder of you
And the wonderful touch of your hand
And my heart starts to beat
Like a child when a birthday is near
So, kiss me my sweet,
It's the lovliest night of the year
