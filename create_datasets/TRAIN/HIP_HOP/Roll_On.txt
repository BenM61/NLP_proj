Yo, Mis-Teeq
Here we go with the one Blacksmith
Aye, oh and away we go
You're gonna get your roll on
Here we go again, all, all, all night long
Enter, check, check

It's been a long week and we've been
Working our booties off
Sometimes it all gets to you
And it's just too much

Gonna hook us up a potion
Guaranteed to bring some fun
With good friends, with some music
Head out to the club and roll on

It's Friday and you just got paid
And Monday is a holiday
You know you need to get away
So grab your boo and get your roll on

Let me hear my fellas say
But let me hear my ladies say
So turn your speakers up and roll on

Here we go another night
Out on the town, we gettin' down
Havin' fun, stayin' young
The whole entourage has arrived

Here on the scene you know what I mean
When I say this world is mine
Just sit back and ride
So turn your speakers up and roll on

It's Friday and you just got paid
And Monday is a holiday
You know you need to get away
So grab your boo and get your roll on

Let me hear my fellas say
But let me hear my ladies say
So turn your speakers up and roll on

Roll on, roll, roll on, roll on, roll on
So grab your boo and get your roll on
Roll on, roll, roll on, roll on, roll on
So turn your speakers up

Let's take it to the flow
What are you waitin' for?
The party's jumpin', now
We're gonna show you how

We like it, we like it
We really, really like it
So turn your speakers up and roll on

It's Friday and you just got paid
And Monday is a holiday
You know you need to get away
So grab your boo and get your roll on

Let me hear my fellas say
But let me hear my ladies say
So turn you speakers up

Yo, yo
So here we go again with Mis-Teeq's flow
What are you waiting for, the crowd say "Bo!"
Feel the vibe within your mind, within your soul
Move your body, body ready to roll

And I said, Monday to Friday the work takes its toll
Here comes the weekend 'cause we make mad dough
Another dolla let me holler, let me grow
'cause in life what you reaps, what you sow

And roll on
It's Friday and you just got paid
And Monday is a holiday
You know you need to get away
So grab your boo and get your roll on

Let me hear my fellas say
But let me hear my ladies say
So turn your speakers up and roll on

It's Friday and you just got paid
And Monday is a holiday
You know you need to get away
So grab your boo and get your roll on

Let me hear my fellas say
But let me hear my ladies say
So turn your speakers up and roll on

Roll on, roll, roll on, roll on, roll on
So grab your boo and get your roll on
Roll on, roll, roll on, roll on, roll on
So turn your speakers up and roll on

Blacksmith, Mis-Teeq
I'll make a make you move your feet
With the styles unique
