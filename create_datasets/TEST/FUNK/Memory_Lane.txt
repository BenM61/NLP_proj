I stumbled on this photograph
It kinda made me laugh
It took me way back
Back down memory lane

I see the happiness... i see the pain
Where am i... back down memory lane

I see us standing there
Such a happy happy pair
Love beyond compare
Look-a-there look-a-there

The way you held me... no one could tell me
That love would die... why oh why
Did i have to find this photograph
Thought i had forgot the past
But now I'm slippin' fast
Back down memory lane

I feel the happiness... i feel the pain
Here am i... back down memory lane
I'm in the sunshine... I'm in the rain

I don't want to go traveling down
Faster than the speed of sound
Back down memory lane
Be still my foolish heart
Don't let this feelin' start
Back down memory lane
I don't want to go... save me save me
