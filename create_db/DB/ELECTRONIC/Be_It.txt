You're a paradise
And I've landed on the
Password
Am I paralyzed?
Cause I need you ever after
All the questioning
You are every single answer
I was shivering
You're the fireplace in winter
What I would not give to have
Here with me is all I ask
Be it as it may
You are every night
And every day
To me
Be it any way
You are everything
And anything
In me
You're my parachute
I can open when I'm falling
When I'm high on you
There could never be a
Warning
You're my victory
When I lost all hope for
Looking
I'm imagining
If it wasn't your loving
