i've got a society woman
she gets the best of everything
yes i got a society woman
she gets the best of everything
she lives in luxury
but she keeps me in the strings
well she want to be a cover girl
and make headlines in the news
she eats steaks and chicken
i eat plain old kidney stew
i love my society woman 
but love ain't worth the price i pay
i bought enough love to last me until my dying days
