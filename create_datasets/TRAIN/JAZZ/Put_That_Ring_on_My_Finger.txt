She loved him completely
In a true and endless way
Though he loved her sweetly
He would never name the day
When she became impatient
With the passing of the years
She'd look at him and cry through her tears

Put that ring on my finger
Buy that golden wedding band
Put that ring on my finger
Put that piece of paper in my hand

If you're anxious to linger
You will you have to name the day
Put that ring on my finger
Go and get the license right away

You make such beautiful speeches
And talk of a honey moon ride
Now let's hear one of those preachers
And that song here comes the bride

Put that ring on my finger
Put that paper in my hand
Put that ring on my finger
Come and wrap me in a wedding band

You make such beautiful speeches
And talk of a honey moon ride
Now let's hear one of those preachers
And that song here comes the bride

Put that ring on my finger
Put that, put that paper in my hand
Put that ring on my finger
Come and come and wrap me up in that wedding band
