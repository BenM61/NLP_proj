You'll never know I cried
When I found out you lied
For I've been hiding all these teardrops in my heart

My eyes dare not reveal
The way I really feel
Because I know I'll cry my heart out if I start
(If I start)

Though I'm pretending
That I don't care
To be with you, my darling, is my prayer
(Is my prayer)

But way down deep inside
I can't give up my pride
So I'll just keep on hiding teardrops in my heart
(In my heart)

But way down deep inside
I can't give up my pride
So I'll just keep on hiding teardrops in my heart
(In my heart)
