Well, I'm proud to be livin' in the USA, playin' for the ARS
Might not be your cup of tea, but I can guarantee you this
We'll have us a large time, a knock down, drag out ball
We'll have us a large, large time, you all

We played Macon, GA with Lynyrd Skynyrd, it was a rock 'n' roll hoedown
Van Zant let that Freebird fly, don't you know he wasn't foolin' around
We had us a large time, you shoulda heard those guitars squall
We had us a large, real large time, you all,  sure had a ball
