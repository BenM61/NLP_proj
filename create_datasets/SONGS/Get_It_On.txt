Get it on, and get yourself ready 
Get it on, pump it up to the max 
Get it on, and get yourself ready 
We'll have a party like it's gonna be the last 

It's hard to take when life is going wrong 
No good to fake and play like you don't care 
No time to waste, now set the record straight 
Gotta change your style before it's too late 

Come and take your chance, let's move it up and down 
Go out and dance, move all over the town 
Now feel the force it's gonna be a blast 
We'll have a party like it's gonna be the last 

Everybody get up- up! 
Everybody get down- down! 
Everybody get wild- alright! 
Everybody scream- whouu! 

It's here and now for you to feel the flow 
Let's start the show, it's time to let it go 
Don't break the law, don't need no kind of drugs 
To make you feel like you're stoned to the bones 

Move it up, move it up- gotta way to take you higher 
Move it up, move it up- like an ACDC wire 
Move it up, move it up- gonna take you to the max 
We'll have a party like it's gonna be the last 

1 2 3 4 here we here we go 
From house to pop from pop to hip hop 
We're gonna slam the funk like Jordan on a dunk 
Gonna kick it real hard till the end of the night 

Make you feel much higher, make you feel right 
Come on y'all you gotta move like us 
'Cause me and my girlfriends are no young pop-fakers 
Diamonds in the house ans you know you can't break us 

Get it on
