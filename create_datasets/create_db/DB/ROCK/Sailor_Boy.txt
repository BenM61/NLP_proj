Sailor boy
(Sailor boy)
Sailor boy
(Sailor boy)
Hurry home to me

When shadows fall I sit alone
And as my eyes get misty
I still recall how much I love
The way you used to kiss me
Though you're away
I love still
I always will

Sailor boy
Oh, sailor boy

My thoughts drift back
To those last days
When we were still together
And once again
I hear you say
That you'll be mine forever
I hope and pray
Those words were true
I wish I knew

Sailor boy
Sailor boy
Oh, my sailor boy

I'll never mind the waving
That's one thing I'll be resigned to
As long as I know you still want
The girl you left behind you
When you come home
Across the sea
Come home to me

Sailor boy
Sailor boy
Oh, my sailor boy

Sailor boy
(Sailor boy)
Sailor boy
(Sailor boy)
Hurry home to me
