I feel like I'm dragging you down a one way street 
I don't know which ways up 
All I ask of you is to stay on your feet 
That should be enough 
If we stand around it could pass us by 
We could give up now, and never even try 

[Chorus] 
To breathe in life and breathe out 
Like tomorrow is today 
Breathe in life and breathe out 
It's not so long to wait 
Breathe in life and breathe out 
Wipe the dust from your sweet smile 
An breathe in life 

I just want something real I can hold onto 
I believe its near 
Life's too short to know the truth 
Maybe it's already hear 
We could throw ourselves into the fire 
We could give up now and never even try 

[Chorus]

We're chasing something we've dreamed of 
(is not always out of reach) 
It's never far away from us 
('cause I believe that) 

[Chorus: x2]
