Round the corner
Turn the corner, turn

Hell is round the corner 
Hot like a sauna
I know I hurt her
When I tell her that I want her
And with this drama
I act like Jeffrey Dahmer
I beat her then I eat her
Nigga's sweet,there's no one sweeter
I think I lost my tweeter
To your pussycats
Do you call your pistols 'gats'?

Don't sleep her love away 
Don't let her run away
Don't sleep her love away
Don't let her

Dream and I'm seein' it
Harmed a girl like Monica
Everyday be like Hanukkah
And change my mind again
Hide off like to find a friend
I call her "enemy"
She says I act like there's ten of me
A sketch for their clone
A dog without a home
But you want more when I was on tour
Told her "you should write a lot"
Now look how much time you got
Told you,"shouldn't run a lot"
Now look how much time you got

Take life on the streets- your own
Made by Grease beats- pure dog
Running with the renegades of NY
Street Dog speak the true talk
Want to talk about crime?
Yeah right!
Stick ups- get in mind to realize
Alright
Run the airtime
F*ck the police it's startin' to get hyped
Niggas gettin' paranoid and void
Then imply Tetth's a bad boy
Just gonna rap about kids that can't cope
Dogs get mad when niggas stand broke
With a phat rope, yo, what a joke!
Shit, I had coke and fifty pound notes
Puffed it for those niggas I know
Far as I know you're a freak if I bone
Like I go 
Trix and Milo
I roll with niggas with big machines
Blank sreens, video scenes
Blue, black and green
Niggas with wigs scared the scam clean
And get the cream- know what I mean?
Diggin' the scene with the gasoline
With enough magazines
Them nine to fives,big executives who ride the clock, 
There'll be no crime from nine to five.
There be no crime for none of us
Livin' to find those kinds of drugs
With no undercovers
Those motherfuckers can't flop dogs
In any form, this rough cough's quick
I'm sick
Going where the Jungle is clicking
In England the trans-Atlantic
In Harlem where demands don't quit

Levitating and useless debating 
In these dvastating times

Don't let her run away

While everybody's just doing drugs
And writing melodic rhymes

Don't sleep her love away

Trying to get one 
And not get into trouble
I might just be inclined

Don't let her run away

We all got needs 
We all do dirty deeds
Now and then want to smoke some weed

Don't sleep her love away

Yeah we're free
Yes we need to be free 
Walkin' round with unsatisfying needs

Don't let her run away

Yeah we're free 
Yes we need to be free
Walkin' round with unsatisfying needs

Don't sleep her love away

Come with a bang bang
It's a hangman gettin' my prayer
My hands can slang bang actors
That have the will to gang slang
That's the type of nigga that can't say,
"you don't go and forget the down times
And the walk while I was with the bad man"
Many to fly right?
Master plan
Miracle flight like Pan-Am
Man,damn!
Sure as the echo
'fore that gonna pump the petrol
Niggas with escorts hide in the get-go
Now lay it in the ghetto
Yeah y'all
I could find life in a Paris metro
While I'm walkin' around slammin' ghettos
In the real
Know the rapper with the black girls
Deliverin' travels with the Maxwells
Gettin' paid off girls
Rockwells, high L's 
Well as drop sales with Stockwell
Street Dog with a Molotov cocktail
No no can't stop flowin' no
Gettin' paid off girls
Rockwells, high L's
Well as drop sales with Stockwell
Street Dog with a molotov cocktail
No no can't stop flowin' no

Levitating and useless debating 
In these devastating times

Don't let her run away

While everybody's just doing drugs
And writing melodic rhymes

Don't sleep her love away

Trying to get one 
And not get into trouble
I might just be inclined

Don't let her run away

We all got needs 
We all do dirty deeds
Now and then want to smoke some weed

Don't sleep her love away

Yeah we're free
Yes we need to be free 
Walkin' round with unsatisfying needs

Don't let her run away

Yeah we're free 
Yes we need to be free
Walkin' round with unsatisfying needs

Don't sleep her love away

Yeah we're free
Yes we need to be free 
Walkin' round with unsatisfying needs

Don't let her run away

Yeah we're free 
Yes we need to be free
Walkin' round with unsatisfying needs

Don't sleep her love away

Yeah we're free
Yes we need to be free 
Walkin' round with unsatisfying needs

Don't let her run away

Yeah we're free 
Yes we need to be free
Walkin' round with unsatisfying needs

Don't sleep her love away
