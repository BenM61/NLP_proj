Early to bed and early to rise 
Makes a man or woman miss out on the nightlife 

Early to bed and early to rise 
Makes a man or woman miss out on the nightlife 

One drink call it an early night 
Soon you're curled up 'neath the reading light 
Or you bathe in the TV's blue tint 

On your pillow
An after dinner mint 

Early to bed and early to rise 
Makes a man or woman miss out on the nightlife 

Early to bed and early to rise 
Makes a man or woman miss out on the nightlife 

Early to bed so you can wait 
For 3 buses a trolley and a train 
I think it's worth it for you to stay awake 
Maybe tomorrow you'll be a little late, but

Early to bed and early to rise 
Makes a man or woman miss out on the nightlife 

Early to bed and early to rise 
Makes a man or woman miss out on the nightlife 

You miss out on the nightlife 

You miss out on the nightlife
