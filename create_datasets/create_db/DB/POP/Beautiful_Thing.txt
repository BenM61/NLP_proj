Couldn't turn round for days
Talking about what you changed
Learn to live, you're not alone
Take your time, and it will come and die
Don't know when

beautiful things don't die
I see it take your hand
Beautiful things don't die

remembering all you said
How that you wish you were there
Learn to live, you're not alone
Take your time, and it will come and die
Don't know when

beautiful things don't die
I see it take your hand
Beautiful things don't die

learn to live, you're not alone
Take your time, and it will come and die
Don't know when

beautiful things
Don't die
I see it take your hand
Beautiful things don't
