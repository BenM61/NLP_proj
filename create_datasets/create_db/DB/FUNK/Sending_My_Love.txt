If I could mail my heart 
Right to you, I would 
I'd pack it up, seal it tight 
And I'd send it over night 

Every time I hear your voice 
And I look into your eyes 
Sends a burning sweet sensation 
Oh, inside of me 

The look in your eyes 
Has found me 
I am sending 

Sending my love to you 
Praying that you are home 
Sealing it with a kiss 
Sending my love 

Sending my love to you 
Praying that you are home 
Sealing it with a kiss 
Sending my love 

With my heart in your hands 
I'm as helpless as a baby 
I'm in desperate need of your love 
So just send it right away 

I've been thinking bout you, boy 
Because you're so far way 
Makes me want to send you all this love 
Inside of me 

The look in your eyes 
Has found me 
I am sending 

Sending my love to you 
Praying that you are home 
Sealing it with a kiss Oh, ho 
Sending my love 

Sending my love to you 
Praying that you are home 
Sealing it with a kiss With a kiss 
Sending my love 

If I could mail my heart 
Right to you, I would 
I'd pack it up, seal it tight 
And I'd send it over night
