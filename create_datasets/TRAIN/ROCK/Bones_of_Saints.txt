They're loading up the ships
They're loading the planes
There's madness in the sky
Above the bones of saints

So much, so nearly broken
The servants of a lie
Now, everything is burning
There's a fire up in the sky

And I said no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No

We're up against the fence
When all the walls fall down
I hear the children scream
But then the fear abound

And ask a leading question
Where all the money come?
And say, who makes the bullets?
Tell me, who sells the guns?

And I said no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No

In the Garden of Eden
And the wheels go 'round and 'round
The song of the ages
Where the best laid deals gone down

In the Garden of Eden
And the wheels go 'round and 'round
The song of the ages
Where the best laid deals gone down

No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No

No
No
No
No
