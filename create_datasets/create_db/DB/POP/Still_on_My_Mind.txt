Rolling seas, endless roads
Heading into the sun
Big skies, bigger dreams
Enough for everyone
I was brave, free of love
I wanted to travel alone
We were born in the light
I'm sorry I remembered it wrong

I'm sorry that I broke you down
I'm sorry that I thought it through
I'm sorry that I looked and run
I couldn't keep up, good enough

You were there when I needed you
And without a word
Stood at my back when I wanted you
Turned away when it hurt
You were there when I called for you
And I walked away
I've run so far, but you're still on my mind
You're still on my mind

The sun began to burn too bright
I saw myself in the light
I opened the door and lost the dream
And couldn't go back inside
I took a road that led nowhere
I didn't know that then
But I made my choice
Now I've gone too far
To come back here again

I'm sorry that I let you down
I'm sorry that I lost the way
I'm sorry that I died and then came alive
I couldn't keep up

You were there when I needed you
And without a word
Stood at my back when I wanted you
Turned away when it hurt
You were there when I called for you
And I walked away
I've run so far, but you're still on my mind
You're still on my mind

You were there when I needed you
And without a word
Stood at my back when I wanted you
Turned away when it hurt
You were there when I called for you
And I walked away
I've run so far, but you're still on my mind
You're still on my mind
