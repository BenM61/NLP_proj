I built a time machine
I'm going to see the homecoming queen
Take her to the Christmas dance
Maybe now I'll get in her pants
Whatever

Back with my high school friends
Meeting where the train tracks end
Passing round a skinny joint
Rolling up to Lookout Point

I want to pull it apart and put it back together
I want to relive all my adolescent dreams
Inspired by true events on movie screens
I am a one man wrecking machine

Back in my parents' house
Back to the shouting out loud
One day you'll be a man
One day you'll understand

I want to pull it apart and put it back together
I want to relive all my adolescent dreams
Inspired by true events on movie screens
I am a one man wrecking machine

Inspired by true events on movie screens
I am a one man wrecking machine

Here in the present tense
Nothing is making sense
Waiting for my moment to come
Everything has come undone

I tried to pull it apart and put it back together
No point in living in my adolescent dreams
Inspired by true events on movie screens
I am a one man wrecking machine

Inspired by true events on movie screens
I am a one man wrecking machine
