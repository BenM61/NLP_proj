Who is this irresistible creature
Who has an insatiable lust for the dead?
Living dead girl!

Rage in the cage and piss upon the stage
There's only one sure way to bring the giant down
Defunct the strings of cemetery things
With one flat foot on the devils wing

Crawl on me
Sink into me
Die for me
Living dead girl

Crawl on me
Sink into me
Die for me
Living dead girl

Raping the geek
And hustling the freak
Like a hunchback juice
On a sentimental noose
Operation filth
They love to love the wealth
Of an S.S. whore
Making scary sounds

Crawl on me
Sink into me
Die for me
Living dead girl

Crawl on me
Sink into me
Die for me
Living dead girl

Cyclone jack, hallucinating hack
Thinks that Donna Reed eats dollar bills
Goldfoot's machine creates another fiend
So beautiful they make you, kill

Crawl on me
Sink into me
Die for me
Living dead girl

Crawl on me
Sink into me
Die for me
Living dead girl

Blood on her skin
Dripping with sin
Do it again
Living dead girl

Blood on her skin
Dripping with sin
Do it again
Living dead girl
