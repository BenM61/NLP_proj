An old friend told me that you just ran out of chances,
One too many dances down the narrow street of time.
Remember how we faced the world, like two tramps shining.
Please, don't let that magic ever end.
Don't forget what we learned living on the wind.

No night so long that you can't find the day;
No day so wrong that you can't find your way;
Call on me like you used to do,
I still can show you who you are.

That day the long and dusty road had us both crying,
We used up our last joke just to try to smile a again.
And only now I find I know what we were learning,
Though it's dark and you have traveled far.
Every long night gives you one bright shining star.

No night so long that you can't find the day;
No day so wrong that you can't find your way;
Call on me like you used to do,
I can still show you who you are.

Deep in the night you know that you'll find,
Deep in the night you know that you'll find the way.
No night so long that you can't find the day;
No day so wrong that you can't find your way;
Call on me like you used to do,
I still can show you who you are.
No night so long that you can't find the day;
No day so wrong that you can't find your way.
