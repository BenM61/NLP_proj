It's alright to be held back by retro-man.
It's far fetched fun when you're the one.
The prize.
I knew you would come through.
I thought I could be right, number one,
But it's a lie.
It's televised in forest green.
It's been brought back by retro-man.
Hold your thoughts in.
It ain't yet over.
You won't slide under me.
The prize.
I knew you would come through.
I thought I could be right, number one,
But it's a lie.
