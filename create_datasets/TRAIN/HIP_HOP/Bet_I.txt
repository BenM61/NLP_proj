That's just what I does
Just put me anywhere on the map
With a backpack strapped still I bet I buzzed
Bet I float, bet I rip this beat, bet I feel that soul,
Bet I go, bet I bench these niggas like Ray, sit down bro
Bet I know everything about this game,
Bet I know my role,
But they know
When I come to the court this is my sport
B dot O-B so bet I'm gone,
Bet I'm on a brand new plane,
Bet I'm in a whole different zone,
I ain't really from this place, so I'm up all night long,
Really in outer space, really ain't got no home,
Really I'm a saint, bet I'm blown,
Bet I'm thrown, up to the sky over the ocean so I fly where ever
I'm goin' when I fly bet I'm focused, if its fire, bet I roll it, matter fact,
You can bet I buzzed.

Grab the ground front and center
The king fittin' to enter
The room with the boom in the booth, I deliver
The hottest, you prolly too small to acknowledge you
Impossible to copy like what everybody try to do
We cool as some dudes on them waves out in Malibu
I'm ballin hard baseline, ball through the alley-oop
Bang!
Comin' through this thang like James in the air off the rim I hang
Nigga this king, pretend you forgot my name if you wanna
I'm a come hard like a boner?
Don't I?
Make a nigga wanna revamp, turn't up, all the way re-amp
Two or three tramp
Wit' 'em in the newest same Bentley
Nigga say he do it like us, you shittin' me?
96, 97 in Atlanta didn't we
Have more blocks than Mutombo Dikembe
For those who can't hold water need a new kidney
Put it down under Australia, Sidney (bye)
And I'm still representing,
For the niggas under prison yard tuned in, listenin'
And I'm back to doing big things
A sucka' lookin' for me, start in yo bitch' dreams
That's right I'm 20 feet tall standing on the big screen
Get dough, get green, my flow sickening,
It's the King nigga!

Put me on anything, still I bet I buzzed

Yeah, back with a cup of that liquor, nigga
Y'all don't really know Tre,
Really know me,
Really know the streets, no!
Y'all niggas really ain't G,
Really ain't hard,
Never really served no hard,
Y'all be playin' that roll
Talkin' that pimp shit,
Never really pimp shit, nah
Y'all be savin' them hoes
But I don't, and I won't
I'll get a bitch anytime I want
I'm that guy, spit that fire
Shake the ground every time I stomp
Beat in the trunk, cup in the air
You can talk shit but I really don't care
Man I'm in the Cadillac don' go
Rat tat a tat tat tat cause a nigga ain't scared
From that red clay, East of the A
Young niggas get locked up everyday
Cops ain't shit so I drop that shit
Have a drop to make it through the day
Grindin' for my pay
It's that nigga Tre
buzzedin' like a pistol best believe it when I say
That I buzzed!

Put me on anything, still I bet I buzzed
Put me anywhere on the map I bet I buzzed
This is what I does, so please don't gas me up
Matter fact, gimme fifteen minutes and a bag of bud I bet I buzzed.
