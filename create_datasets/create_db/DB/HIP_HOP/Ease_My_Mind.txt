I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.
 
Thrusted in a world that I don't know 
from my mama's lips between my mama's hips.
I'm cuddled by her hands because she understands.
It's that bond that keeps the movement movin' on.
Life is surrounded with so many insecurities.
Back stabbin' is like breathing when in poverty.
I try to make my sanity with the insane.
God is secondary to most when they scrape for money.
But then again, money can cause even more death,
when an African turns nigga step'n fetch'n all.
I dare say when price is right you can buy us all.
Well, not me, cuz I don't truly give a damn about you.
I'll move in poverty, in wealth, but I'll surely move!
Ain't syncopated with your beat or your wack grooves.
My break beat is to break away from yo thang.
All these things you put on me makes this brother sing.
 
I need some time to ease my mind.
I struggle. That's why I tell you:
I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.
 
Mind and soul is even more important than body.
Well, you can put my body in all exotic spaces.
Meanwhile my mind, it so remotely dwells 
within that fine spot between all f---ed up and hell.
And so I move on with confidence of harmony 
and do my thing to resist this white society
'cause if you don't resist and I mean consciously,
you fool your subconscious into accepting it.
I ain't accepting it.  I keep my focus. I keep my focus.
I ain't accepting it. Give me a face pencil to draw a smile on me
and say my prayer to give my earthlybody inner peace.
And say my prayer to give my earthly body inner, inner peace
until that day upon which my soul's released.
 
I need some time to ease my mind.
I struggle. That's why I tell you:
I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.
Need some time.  Need some time.
When the sisters say it 
you know it's gotta be real.
 
Thrusted in a world that I don't know
from my mama's lips between my mama's hips.
I'm cuddled by her hands because she understands.
It's that bond that keeps the movement movin' on.
And so I gotta be ready to relinquish,
gotta be ready to relinquish my breath of life for
 
I need some time to ease my mind.
I struggle. That's why I tell you:
I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.
I need some time to ease my mind.
