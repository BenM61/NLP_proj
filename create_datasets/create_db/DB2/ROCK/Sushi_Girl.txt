Skating down in Shinjuku
When I smelled love in the air
Rolling by the pagoda
The fragrance floats from somewhere

Will my Suki find me in time
Or will her sushi spawn
The odor drives me out of my mind
The scent goes straight to my prawn

Su-su-sushi 
Mushi-mushi
Cherry blossom and rice
Su-su-sushi she's so nice

Recklessly I order away
This one thinks it's still swimmin'
Tail and fin she dives right in
Who could ever want more

Su-su-sushi (sushi girl)
Mushi-mushi (sushi girl)
Cherry blossom (sushi girl) and rice
Su-su-sushi she's so nice

Su-su-sushi don't you cry
Take you to the sushi bar and buy you some
Fillet and claw
Clam and tuna

Gonna eat it raw
She's my my abaluna
Suck a tentacle dip it in sauce
Hot green root it sure is boss

My only vice is to slice it nice
And wrap it in rice'Oh, what a device
Su-su-sushi (sushi girl)
Mushi-mushi (sushi girl)

Cherry blossom (sushi girl) and rice
Su-su-sushi she's so nice
Su-su-sushi (sushi girl)
She go mushi (sushi girl)

Cherry blossom (sushi girl) and rice
Su-su-sushi got that right tonight
Su-su-sushi (hot sake)
She go mushi (wasabe)

Cherry blossom (and rice) and rice
Su-su-sushi
