I wake up in the morning with my head up in the clouds, got nowhere to go 
This feeling deep inside of me tells me tells me I ought to be back on the road. 
Well it hurt me to no end to see the back of my best friend 
Guess I'll go and pack my things 
And I'll get back on the road again 

Well I've been a lot of places and I've seen a lot of faces just moving around 
Living out a suitcase, running in the rat race, doing the rounds 
Well it took me by surprise to see the sadness in her eyes 
Guess I'll go and pack my things 
And get back on the road again 

Don't you worry, I'll be back someday 
Ain't no hurry, I've just got time to slip away 

Guess it's hard to understand why a home loving man wants to get up and go 
But this feeling deep inside of me tells me tells me I ought to be back on the road. 
Well I hope she'll realise I'm just another guy 
Guess I'll go and pack my things 
And I'll get back on the road again 

Yes I'll go and pack my things 
And I'll get back on the road again 
Go and pack my things 
And get back on the road again
