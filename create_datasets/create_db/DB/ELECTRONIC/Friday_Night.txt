Friday night
Put my backpack on to do my thing
But the bouncer wouldn't let me in
He just stood there with a stupid grin

Last time I went on crying
But I kept trying
'Cause he don't know the moves that I'm supplying
I'll take my glasses
I'm gonna bounce back up
And kick some asses
I've waited long enough

You think you own me
You don't control me
You think you hurt me
Saying that I'm freaky
You're just afraid
I'm here to stay
Just 'cause I'm different
I should've walked away

You think you own me
I control you
You think you own me
I control you
(Okay) own me
I control you
You think you own me
I control you

You're a freak
Don't belong 'cause you're alone and weak
But I'm just as cool as I am geek
Mr. Power I am all on fleek

And this time I won't be crying
No, I'm not buying
You know the slide as the moves that I'm supplying
I'll take my glasses
I'm gonna bounce back up
And kick some asses
I'm 'bout to call your bluff

You think you own me
You don't control me
You think you hurt me
Saying that I'm freaky
You're just afraid
I'm here to stay
Not gonna be that geek who walked away

You think you own me
You don't control me
You think you hurt me
Saying that I'm freaky
You're just afraid
I'm here to stay
Just 'cause I'm different
I shouldn't walk away

You think you own me
I control you
You think you own me
I control you
(Okay) own me
I control you
You think you own me
I control you

Own me
I control you
You think you own me
I control you
You think you own me
I control you
You think you own me
I control you
