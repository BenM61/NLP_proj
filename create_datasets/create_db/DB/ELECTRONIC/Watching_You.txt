Take me downtown
It's where the people rock
Three hundred sixty-five ?
'Cause we never stop

Take me downtown
'Cause people's runnin' wild
See how we kick it 
In a brand new style

Take me downtown
It's where I wanna go
Everyone I know
Is going to my show

Take me downtown
Where the city hums
Then get your head numb
To the beat of the drums, 'cause

I see you watching me watching you
And now you see just where you gotta be
I see you watching me watching you
And now you see just where you gotta be

Take me downtown
'Cause baby wants to rock
I need a little edge 
With my electro (?) pop

Take me downtown
So everybody sees
I know my moves
Like by A-B-C's

Take me downtown
It's time we made it right
This show ain't going nowhere
We'll just party all night

Take me downtown
Where the city hums
Then get your head numb
To the beat of the drums

I see you watching me watching you
And now you see just where you gotta be
I see you watching me watching you
And now you see just where you gotta be

Baby rock, never stop
Round and round the clock

Lover's rock, give it up
Never, never stop

Baby rock, get on top
Take it, take it all

I'm not the kind of girl
Who's scared of you at all, 'cause

I see you watching me watching you
I see you watching me watching ? Rock!

I see you watching me watching you
And now you see just where you gotta be
I see you watching me watching you
And now you see just where you gotta be
