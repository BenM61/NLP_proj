What? 
Well, let me roll up on to the sidewalk and take a look
Yes, whoa! She's beautiful
I'm talking about a Yankee Rose
And she looks wild, wild, wild, wild! 

Are you ready for the new sensation
Well here's a shot heard 'round the world
All you back room boys salute
When her flag unfurls
Well guess who's back in circulation
Now I don't know what you may have heard
But what I need right now's
The original good time girl 

She's a vision from coast to coast (coast to coast)
Sea to shining sea (sea to shining sea)
Hey, sister you're the perfect host
(Make a toast)
Show me your bright lights
And your city lights, all right
I'm talking 'bout the Yankee Rose
Bright lights
And your city lights, all right
I'm talking 'bout it 

When she walks
Watch, the sparks will fly
Fire cracking on the Fourth of July
No sad songs tonight
Something's in the air
Yeah, the feeling gets you
A real state of independence
So pretty when her rockets flare
Still proving every night
That her flag's still there 

She's a vision from coast to coast (coast to coast)
Sea to shining sea (sea to shining sea)
Hey, sister you're the perfect host
(Make a toast)
Show me your bright lights
And your city lights, all right
I'm talking 'bout the Yankee Rose
(Your) bright lights
And your city lights, all right
I'm in love with a Yankee Rose

Oh she's beautiful, all right
Nothing like her in the whole world
Yeah she's right on time
I'm on the case
Pick up the phone
No time to waste
She's got the beat
And there's a little bit
Coming your way 

Oh raise 'em up there
Let's see who salutes baby
Little bit, little bit, little bit higher
Here's the national anthem
A wanna get a little bit of apple pie, man 

Bright lights, city lights
Bright lights, city lights
Bright lights, city lights
