Turned away, turned away 
Turned away, turned away 
From love 

Too many times I feel 
We are losing time once shared 
And only when you're in ecstasy 
You seem to really care 

Didn't you say not to worry 
I can only speak for myself 
How do you think that I'm happy, baby 
With a love like mine 
Locked up on a shelf 

Remember my love had a place 
It was a part of the game 
And just when I went all the way 
I'm in too deep 
Girl, you made the choice 
And sent away 

(Turned away) 
When you should've been giving 
(Turned away) oh 
As I started believing 
(Turned away) 
Just as I was living 
(Turned away from love) 

I discovered you were untrue 
So unfortunate for you 
There is nothing that I wouldn't do 
I only gave you the best 
I ever had to you 

Don't let sympathy show her face 
Girl, let's not pretend 
I'm no longer in this race 
You've got your space 
Still it hurts me that you 

(Turned away) 
When you should've been giving 
(Turned away) oh 
As I started believing 
(Turned away) 
Just as I was living 
(Turned away from love) 
Don't turn away from my love 
(Turned away from my love) 
(Turned away from my love) 

(Turned away) 
When you should've been giving 
(Turned away) oh 
As I started believing 
(Turned away) 
Just as I was living 
(Turned away from love) 

Turned away from love 

(Turned away) 
When you should've been giving 
(Turned away) oh 
As I started believing 
(Turned away) 
Just as I was living 
(Turned away from love) 
Don't turn away from my love 
(Turned away from my love) 
(Turned away from my love) 

(Turned away) 
When you should've been giving 
(Turned away) oh 
As I started believing 
(Turned away) 
Just as I was living 
(Turned away from love) 

Turned away, turned away 
Turned away, turned away
