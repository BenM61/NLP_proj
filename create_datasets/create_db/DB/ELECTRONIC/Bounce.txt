All I do is party ha ha ha yo

See all I do, drink my groove, get high too.
I'll get high too.
Yes I like what you like, good lesbian,
Don't call her dike, nope!
She just bounced, she comes over,
Neptune style, she ain't sober
She roll over, keep composer
Chip on her shoulder, been done colder
That ain't good, keep it hood
Sell your soul with a break in the wood
She just bucked, keep in the club
Ride her rough, ride a dub

All I do is party ha ha ha ha
All I do is party ha ha ha ha
So bounce low, bounce low
Bounce high, bounce high
All I do is party ha ha ha ha
All I do is party ha ha ha ha
So bounce low, bounce low
Bounce high, bounce high
All I do is party ha ha ha

Shes poppin' shit, poppin' it, poppin' this, poppin' it
She be good, know I'm hood
Overseas Tim Westwood
Ha ha ha it ain't ghost
Roll in the whip, don't move my spokes
Mstrkrft, Master Paul
N.O.R.E. we don't fall
We just ball, always poppin'
Beat the case Johnny Cochran
Mstrkrft, Master Paul, N.O.R.E. we don't fall
