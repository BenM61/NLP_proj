Woo hoo!

Baby, where've you been?
It's half past ten.
Oh, look you're late again.
Busy day, got a lot on your mind?
You should hear about mine.
A tall drink of water and a pretty little thing
Were kissing on corner in the pouring rain.
Turned my head to get a better view
Oh lord, help me it was you.

Didn't love me
I ain't no fool
Didn't love me
No, no, no, no.
Love, love you let me down
Making this too easy
Love, love you let me down
Think you should be leaving
Love, love you let me down
Let me down
No you wont string me along
You better be moving on
Giddy on up
Giddy on out

(oh I ain't finished yet sit back down.)

Been acting pretty strange, didn't want to talk.
Mm, there's a pep in your walk
Smiling a lot when you look at your phone
There's a change in your tone.
Ive been through your pockets and smelled your shirts
I don't wear bath and body works
Should've seen the signs you were sneakin' around
She must be the number on the napkin I found

Didn't love me
I ain't no fool
Didn't love me
No, no, no, no.
Love, love you let me down
Making this too easy
Love, love you let me down
Think you should be leaving
Love, love you let me down
Let me down
Ooh you wont string me along
You better be moving on
Giddy on up
Giddy on out

Oh let me tell you
I guess you could say that I was blind
I was blinded by my love
I did everything for you
And now push has come to shove
So lets call the spade to spade
Was it worth the price you paid?
Now I am done, I'm the lucky one
And you can sleep in the bed you made.

Didn't love me
I ain't no fool
Didn't love me
No, no, no, no.
Love, love you let me down
Making this too easy
Love, love you let me down
Think you should be leaving
Love, love you let me down
Let me down
Ooh you wont string me along

Love, love you let me down
Making this too easy
Love, love you let me down
Think you should be leaving
Love, love you let me down
Let me down
Ooh you wont string me along
You better be moving on
Giddy on up
Giddy on out
