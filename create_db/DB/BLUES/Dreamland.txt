Dreamin' 
Makin' my way 
Dreamin' 
Won't let me stay in your arms 
In your warm 
In your love 

Sleepin' 
Away the day 
Hopin' 
That we two could stay 
All alone 
On our own revelries 

Let's make a pact for our lives 
And our homelands 
Built on the bricks that we bathed 

In my dreamland 
Home sweet dreamland 
Always a dreamland 
For the two of us, 
Together, 
We'll stay 

Let's build a homeland together in the sand 
We have forever right here at hand 
In dreamland 
Home sweet dreamland 
Always a dreamland 
For the two of us, 
Together, 
We'll stay
