Roses, I send you roses, with all the love their tender blossoming discloses.
Just like my heart, they'll open wide, you'll see my heart inside.

Please dear, embrace the roses, 
And I will come to you and when the long day closes,
My love for you will burst to flame
And put the red, red, roses to shame.
