We used to ride, baby
Ride around in limousines
We looked so fine, baby
You in white and me in green
Drinking and dancing
All inside a crazy dream
Well now, look at your face now baby
Look at you and look at me

I get so scared
Just to see you on the street
They're living dead
You're all the same, you never speak
You're wrecked out now
Washed-up high up on the beach
Well now, look at your face now, baby
Look at you and look at me

Work to it

We used to shine, shine, shine, shine
Say what a pair, say what a team
We used to ride, ride, ride, ride
In a long black limousine
Those dreams are gone, baby
They're locked away and never seen
Well now, look at your face now, baby
Look at you and look at me

Look out, yeah
