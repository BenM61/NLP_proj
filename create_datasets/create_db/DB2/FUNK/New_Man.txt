I never knew that I would feel this way about her
She was s'posed to be a jump-off not a lover
She's got me doing things that go against the code
My homies look at me and saids she's got you gone

(Bridge)
I look in... the mirror... and I see... a stranger
He looks like me, but not quite me
If you think that's too deep
Girl I can break it down (break it down)

She makes me feel like a convict, fresh out of jail
I know it may sound crazy but she's made me a new man (uh uh)
A new man (uh uh), a new man (feel like a brand new man, oh)
Just like an alcoholic, one month out of rehab

A new man (new man), a new man (feel like a brand new man)

She makes me feel like a convict, fresh out of jail
I know it may sound crazy but she's made me a new man (uh uh)
A new man (uh uh), a new man (feel like a brand new man, oh)
Just like an alcoholic, one month out of rehab
No exaggeration, yes she has, she made me a new man (new man)
A new man (new man), a new man (feel like a brand new man)

I don't even walk the same, don't even talk the same
I'm different, she made me different
I don't even walk the same, don't even talk the same
Don't know what she did to me

She makes me feel like a convict, fresh out of jail
I know it may sound crazy but she's made me a new man (uh uh)
A new man (uh uh), a new man (feel like a brand new man, oh)
Just like an alcoholic, one month out of rehab
No exaggeration, yes she has, she made me a new man (new man)
A new man (new man), a new man (feel like a brand new man)

(Brand new man)
(Brand new man)
