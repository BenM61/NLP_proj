Daddy dance with me 
Too far gone to even speak 
Neil Young on the radio 
Four dead in Ohio 

Daddy are you asleep? 
Your son's a mess 
And your daughter's a freak 
And when you hit the road 
This time it's a heavy load 

We tried everything to get you back 
Even sprung a junkie from rehab 
I'll have another drink 
If it makes you laugh 
We'll try anything 
Because we love you daddy 

Michael and me 
A long long time ago 
We were a family 
And I don't want to let you go 
This life is all we know 
We tried everything 
To get you to laugh 
Even put a monkey on my back 

Have another drink 
If it makes you sad 
We'll try anything 
Because we love you 
Because we love
