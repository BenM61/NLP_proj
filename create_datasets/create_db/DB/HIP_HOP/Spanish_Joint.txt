Whenever it rains I feel this way
A little somethin' to get me through this day
Give me a little that, no time flat
Gonna be a good thing
Serene, but in need of feelin' free
Lettin' go and landin' on my feet
Brushed the dirt off my back, no time flat
Gonna be a good thing

Well, people believe this sayin' is true
Whatever will be, will forever do
Whatever the cost, I'll pay in full
I ain't got nothin' to do with you

Gotta get out, gotta get out of here
I'm in the dark and the light looks sincere
Brushed the dirt off my back, no time flat
Gonna be a good thing
All you do is complain about your pain
And the cloud that follows you won't cease to rain
Don't look back, handle that
Make it into a good thing

Somethin' in me's gotta be
Soul controller in control of me
A link in your chain just won't do
I don't want nothin' to do with you
'Sup?
Somethin' stirrin' inside of me's gotta be
Soul controller in control of me
A link in your chain just won't do
I don't want nothin' to do with you

Well, people believe this sayin' is true
Whatever will be, will forever do
Whatever the cost, I'll pay in full
I ain't got nothin' to do with you

I ain't got nothin' to do with you
