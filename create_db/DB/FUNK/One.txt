Let me start by sayin' that you're the one
'Cause this is the first time I felt like this player's done

You're the only number that I dial from them other chicks
You're the only sex I'm gettin' now, ain't that a trip
But it don't matter 'cause you're in it and it don't matter but then I get it
'Cause you're the only one

I'ma be good with just one girl
One girl, that's all I need
I'ma be straight with just one crib
And two whips 'cause I'm grown now, that's all I need

Is one ghetto girl to make my baby's sleep
And one ghetto girl I'm shakin' all of my chicks
That's why I'm down on one knee with one ring
Baby all I need is one

Ain't nothing gonna stop me from lovin' you
And wifein' you, spendin' all my life with you
Baby, I'm so committed
This one on one I'm with it, it's so damn good

All the sex you want without no hat imagine that
Got a real nigga that's gon' have your back, imagine that
That's just the way it is, and that's just how it's gon' go
And you gon' be that one, girl

I'ma be good with just one girl
One girl, that's all I need
I'ma be straight with just one crib
And two whips 'cause I'm grown and that's all I need

Is one ghetto girl to make my baby's sleep
And one ghetto girl I'm shakin' all of my chicks
That's why I'm down on one knee with one ring
Baby all I need is one

Girl, I ain't gonna front about it
Down and tell the truth about it, way gone
Ain't nothin' I won't give up just to make you that one
Baby, that one girl

One step, one breath
One love, one name

So it's one me
One ring, one church
One preacher
One choir, two little words

I'ma be good with just one girl
Just one girl, that's all I need
I'ma be straight with just one crib
And two whips 'cause I'm grown and that's all I need

Is one ghetto girl to make my baby's sleep
And one ghetto girl I'm shakin' all of my chicks
That's why I'm down on one knee with one ring
Baby all I need is one

One girl, one girl
Baby all I need is one
One girl, one girl
Baby all I need is one

One me, one ring
One church
