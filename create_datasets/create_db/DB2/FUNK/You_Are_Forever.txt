Even mountains will crumble
Rivers will dry, stars will fall
And kings will be humbled
The weakest of men will be standing tall

Time changes, rearranges
Mountains and kings, everything
But you are forever
Baby, you are my night and day
You are forever
Darling I cannot remember when
I didn't love you

Yesterday is a memory
Tomorrow will come and fade away
But my love is eternal
I promise you it will always stay
Time changes, rearranges
Things come and go
But one thing I know is
You are forever
Baby, you are my now and then
You are forever
And darling I cannot remember when
I didn't want you, need you, love you
Yeahess, love you, ah love you, love you, love you

Time changes, rearranges
Mountains and kings, everything
But you are forever
Baby, you are my now and then
You are my forever
I cannot remember when
I didn't love you

You're forever and ever
Baby, baby, ever ever, and ever
I, I cannot remember when
I didn't love you
Oh, love you, oh, love you love you
Can't remember when I didn't love you
Love you, love you, love you, hey yeah
Love you, oh, love you
