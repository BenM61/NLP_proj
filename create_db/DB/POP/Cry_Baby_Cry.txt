Cry, baby, cry, cry, baby cry,
Just the way I did the day you broke my heart
Cry, baby, cry, you flew too high
Tables turned and now you've learned you're not so smart
You broke every promise
You couldn't be true
You gave me the go-by
For somebody new when I needed you
Cry, baby, cry. My eyes are dry.
I'm laughin' up my sleeve to see my cry baby cry.
