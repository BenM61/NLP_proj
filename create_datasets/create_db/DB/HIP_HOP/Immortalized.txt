Worldwide, Immortalized, Worldwide, Worldwide, Immortalized
Worldwide, Immortalized, smokin' endo with my killers
We ride, heat on the side, in drama niggas die
Cross fire, can't let them slide till the Riggermortus said in his eyes
Niggas surprise, youse dumped on by some ki's on the rise

Shot yo' ass when I'm pulled out the chrome
I was puttin' niggas in the pavin' before this rap shit came along
Immortalized through this thug shit, 
The niggas is spittin' (spittin')
Attractin' phillie, a bag of sticky green and a game of splittin'
We on a mash to the certain niggas dumpin' my cash
Motherfuckers want to see me six feet in the grave thinkin' I won't last
But I'm a soldier, I told you bitches now "What the f*ck"
The only way I'm fallin' is slippin' on one of you niggas' blood
I'm in this shit for life (life) 
And when my cash get dropped (dropped)
May my thug traces be Immortalized like Biggie and Pac
Get my shit, slugs and niggas' trunk for blocks and blocks
Immortal thug shit will never stop, Immortalized

I can't believe these jea-jealous niggas don't want to se-see me rise
I'm in the Caddy go-got me thug-thuggin' worldwide
Turnin' mobbin' into Immortalized, Immortalized, worldwide, worldwide
I can't believe these jea-jealous niggas don't want to se-see me rise
I'm in the Caddy go-got me thug-thuggin' worldwide
Turnin' mobbin' into Immortalized, Immortalized, worldwide, worldwide

One love for niggas like Eazy E 
Soldiers who put a dent in the game
It ain't the same, 
Head holdin' niggas strain and the fame clogged up my brain
This thug shit will drive a nigga insane, 
Diamond licks and chains
With Infra-Red we aim, 
Niggas loc'ed up for the cash, when the real G's came
Thug-thuggin' last up in my veins I can't be changed
Immortalized like the Presidents with they faces on rocks
Ebonic Sleazy is the language for the game that we chop (chop)
Green leaves, cannibus seeteev, and crystal
Fifty G's, makin' niggas bleed with pistols
Put it down, 'cause it ain't no time for fuckin' around
Every nigga want to see these figures on up no less, we pass the bets
Remember me? The man with the 50 cat in my hand
Comin' more savage than Tarzan, here what I'm sayin'?
Niggas speakin' up on my casket, but I ain't sweatin' you haters
Ay listen, weren't for bitch-ass-niggas it wouldn't be real players
Represent to the fullest, at the same time dodgin' bullets (bullets)
But this mug shit ain't easy nigga, but somebody gotta do it
Immortalized, Immortalized, ah
F*ck I'm gonna peel this bitch, for sheesy, blaow!

Never die, just mulitply, thug niggas, Immortalize
Energise like them batteries, caught up in the mob life
Niggas be talkin' that crazy shit when they don't know what the f*ck they sayin'
Makin' money off rap music when you was in Elementary playin' and slayin'
It's all real, shootin' back at the niggas shootin' to kill
Well if it's 'f*ck my life' it's 'f*ck your life', go to war with steel
If you niggas ain't feelin' me, f*ck your clique and your hood
It's Bossalini, straight soldier, never went out of wood
Always ridin' through the streets hittin' corners with fellas
In a bucket or a Benzo, when we blast it ain't no tellin'
It's West Side till my life expire
Mob music till the wheels fall off, motherfucker we all ride!
Put the fire to the endo, sip of the Hen
Cause you will never see a bad guy like this one again
Pullin' on you niggas with no mask on, straight smash
If it weren't for rappin', I'll be jackin' gettin' my blast on
