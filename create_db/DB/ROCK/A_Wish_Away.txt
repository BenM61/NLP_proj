Don't litter my streets
With your bad name
Don't tell the people
That we're the same.
You've got no hope for the future,
So stop looking or someone to blame.
It's about time you learned to laugh again
It's about time you learned to grin,
'Cause just closing your eyes
At the things you despise, won't
Get you out of the great big mess you're in.
So, shake it like a shaking thing
That you never had,
And try to make out life is good
When life is something bad.
Spin 'round like a spinning thing
That you've never seen,
'Cause the bes thing that you've got
In life, is your
Eight Legged Groove Machine... Ah grin.
It's about time you learned to laugh again
It's about time you learned to grin,
Oh the jokes run fast,
But the laughing stopped.
What a terrible mess we've gotten in.
Don't litter my streets with your bad name
Don't tell all my friends that we're the same
'Cause you've never had fun
And your life has just begun
And you're walking around
Thinking you're the only one
Who's not got anyone left to blame.
