You dreamboats, you lovable dreamboats 
The kisses you gave me set my dreams afloat 
I would sail the seven seas with you 
Even if you told me to go and paddle my own canoe 

Sincerely, I love you so dearly 
I'd follow you darling to any shore 
You dreamboats you lovable dreamboats 
Say that you'll be mine for ever more
