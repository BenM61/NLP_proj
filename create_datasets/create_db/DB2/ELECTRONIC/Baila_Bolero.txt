You gonna look him up to see him carry on
I feel the music hot under the descending sun

A never ending desire
Will never know your name
And every move you inspire
A word cannot explain

The long and staring sight
Into his planet eyes
And you were safe with me

You dance the night away

Baila bolero
Another dance for me
You take my heart, hasta luego
Don't be afraid to give your latin love to me

Don't ever set me free

Afraid of look him up to find my dream has gone
Until tomorrow comes you'll be the only one

You turn my soul into fire
An ever burnin' flame
Your love could be so fun
Don't wanna change my mind
And do a serenade

You dance the night away

Baila bolero
And take a chance with me
You take my heart, hasta luego
Don't be afraid to give your latin love to me

Baila bolero
Another dance for me
You take my heart, hasta luego
Don't be afraid to give your latin love to me

Don't ever set me free

Baila, baila

Baila bolero
You take my heart, hasta luego
