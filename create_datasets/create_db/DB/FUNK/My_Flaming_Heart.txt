Burn low my flaming heart
A night like this could be the end or the start
Burn low my flaming heart
Burn away the past I want this love to last
And it won't if you burn too fast

I'm here with the one I used to dream of
And more than she knows
I want her so
Burn bright my flaming heart
I need your light 
But when I hold her tight
My flaming heart burn slow

I'm here with the one I used to dream of
And more than she knows
I want her so
Burn bright my flaming heart
I need your light
But when I hold her tight
My flaming heart burn slow
My flaming heart burn slow
