This is who I am, this is what I do
I'll spread the gospel, share the good news
This is who I am, this is what I do
I'll spread the gospel, share the good news

Lord, You knew me long before I was here
Shaped my destiny, had a plan for me
Then you sent me to the world to proclaim
Your love and grace, so in spite of what men say

This is who I am, this is what I do
I'll spread the gospel, share the good news
This is who I am, this is what I do
I'll spread the gospel, share the good news

It?s amazing, all the things that You do
I'm so grateful, You decided to choose
Me to draw men from the world back to You
My life I owe send me Lord, I?ll go

This is who I am, this is what I do
I'll spread the gospel, share the good news
This is who I am, this is what I do
I'll spread the gospel, share the good news

It seems strange when I see
The way You had for me
But this charge I must keep
I?ll follow You, wherever You lead

This is who I am, this is what I do
I'll spread the gospel, share the good news
This is who I am, this is what I do
I'll spread the gospel, share the good news

This is who I am, this is what I do
I'll spread the gospel, share the good news
This is who I am, this is what I do
I'll spread the gospel, share the good news
