I'm gonna tell this heart of mine
I've gotta find a way to just forget her
Gonna try and say, it's time to let her
Go her own sweet way

Ooh
But every little move she makes
Only takes my love a little closer
Any other guy who really knows her
Would feel the same way too
And every time she looks my way
I have to say I hear the music playing
Voices in my head that keep on saying
She's the one for you.

Of all the other girls I've known
This one is in a class all on her own
And though I've tried, I've really tried
I just can't leave that girl alone
(hey)

But every little move she makes
Only takes my love a little closer
Any other guy who really knows her
Would feel the same way too
And every time she looks my way
I have to say I hear the music playing
Voices in my head that keep on saying
She's the one for you.

Of all the other girls I've known

And though I've tried, I've really tried
I just can't leave that girl alone

Every little move she makes
Only takes my love a little closer
Any other guy who really knows her
Would feel the same way too
