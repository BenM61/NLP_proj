Yeah, you know I worked on the railroad
I even worked down on that chain gang
Yeah, you know I worked on the railroad
Oh, boy and I worked down on the chain gang

Yeah, you know I've been in a lots of trouble
Yes, and I've been in mostly everything
Yeah, they put me in jail when it was raining
Honey, that was the best for me

Throwed me in the jail when it was raining
Honey, that is the best for me
You know the jail kept me from getting wet
I didn't have no place to stay, don't you see?

When I was working on the chain gang
Ball and chain all around my leg
When I was working on the chain gang
Ball and chain all around my leg

I said, "Please don't drive me too hard, I'm an old man"
They say, "We don't pay no attention to the age"

He said, "Who sent you down here, boy?
What did you break in this jail for?
Who sent you down here, boy?
What did you break in this jail for?"

He say, "You look like a man who would kill your mother"
And I believe he did
Oh, boy, what did you kill that old woman for?
A sad time and I had to cry

I said mister jailer
Will you please, sir, bring me the key?
I said, mister jailer
Will you please, sir, bring me the key?

I say I just want you to open the door
'Cause this ain't no place for me
