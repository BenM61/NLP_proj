Can you dig it?
Something in the air tonight 
Got a one way ticket 
Baby, don't you wanna ride?
Got to make it 
Make it to the other side 
I've got demons 
Snapping at my heels tonight 

I just want to runaway 
Turn me loose 
Got people around running me down, I can't stay 
Woo
I just want to get away
I just want to get away now
Get them off my back today 

Can you feel it?
I'm stuck inside in a hurricane 
Chasing rainbows 
Can't you see I'm going insane?
I wanna be a free man 
But I'm spinning on this crazy wheel
I'm jumping for the high bar
Can't you dig it?
No longer know what I feel
Can't you see?

I just want to runaway 
Turn me loose 
Got people around running me down, I can't stay 
I just want to get away, I just want to get away now
Get them off my back today 

I just wanna runaway 
Turn me loose, turn me loose 
Turn me loose, turn me loose 

Got to make it, got to make it 
Got to break it, got to make it 

I just want to runaway 
Just want to runaway 
Got people around running me down, I can't stay 
Can't stay here long now 
I just want to get away 
I just got to get away 
Get them off my back today 
Woo

I just want to runaway 
La la la la la la 
Just want to get away 
La la la la la la 
Turn me loose, runaway, runaway 
Got people around running me down, I can't stay 
Runaway, runaway 

I just want to runaway 
La la la la la la 
Just got to get away 
La la la la la la 
Turn me loose, runaway 
Get them off my back today
