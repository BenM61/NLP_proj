They got a place down Kentucky 
Right down near Ohio 
Where you can watch the planes at night 
People line up to watch each flight 
I said watchin' them planes 
I wish I was on one 
I'm sittin' here thinkin' 'bout my red head dream 
If I could only see her tonight 
 
Oh Atlanta, oh Atlanta! 
I said yeah! yeah! yeah! Atlanta, got to get back to you 
 
Well you can drop me off on Peachtree 
I got to feel that Georgia sun 
And the women there in Atlanta 
They make you awfully glad you come 
I said watchin' them planes 
I wish I was on one 
I'm sittin' here thinking 'bout my crazy dream 
If I could only be there tonight 
 
Oh Atlanta, oh Atlanta! 
I said yeah! yeah! yeah! Atlanta, got to get back to you 
 
We make a day and how just you and me 
But the music plays all night 
They got the boogie band blowin' that's bound for hell 
And when they get to movin' they never stop 
You just keep on playin' that down home beat 
You just keep on layin' it down hot 
 
I wish I was on one 
I'm sittin' here thinkin' 'bout my red haired dream 
If I could only see her tonight 
 
Oh Atlanta, oh Atlanta! 
I said yeah! yeah! yeah! Atlanta, got to get back to you
