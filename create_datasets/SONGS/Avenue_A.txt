You want to be an actress
And step down on the stage
You are going to the school Julliard
To learn how to strut so high and proud
Make me stand up and notice
That you are not afraid
I believe in you
And I believe you'll have it made

I cut out my heart And mailed it away
Save it for your summer holiday
You'll forget about me
When your name is on the marquee
And the rich boys come out to play
Upon Avenue 'A'

You've got your reasons
And I've got mine
I'll nail your cards and letter on the wall
To remind me that you are still out there
Because I won't know the girl on the screen at all

Cut out my heart And mailed it away
And save it for your summer holiday
You'll forget about me
When your name is on the marquee
And your up on Avenue 'A'

Cut out my heart And mailed it away
And save it for your summer holiday
Teach them how to laugh and feel
When they put you to the test
For there is something special in you
That you must express

Don't forget about me
When your name is on the marquee
And the rich men come to stay
Up on Avenue 'A'
Up on Avenue 'A'
