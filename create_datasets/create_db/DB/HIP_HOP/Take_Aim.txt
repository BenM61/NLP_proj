Nightmares, oh nightmares come on now
Getting my days all wrong now
Risen from prison an outlaw
Spending our time in the lion's jaw
In the end you sink or swim
I'm eager, I'm eager

Loving more loving come on now
Socially biting your tongue now
Run down oh run down old houses
Feeding the cats to the mouses

[Chorus]
Oh take aim now!
Oh take aim now!
Can you see me in the way now
Oh take aim now!
Oh take aim now!
Gotta get us out of here

Drop them and give them star prizes
Lock them away in high rises
Held off and called on by truncheons
Rattling keys to the dungeons

[Chorus]

Don't take me over
I bid you all farewell
I've got to leave
Tears on my shovel
Switch me off today

[Chorus: x2]

Don't take me over
I bid you all farewell
I've got to leave
