If only you'd never speak to me 
The way that you do 
If only you'd never speak like that 
It's like listening to 
A breaking heart 
A falling sky 

Fire go out and friendship die 
I wish you felt the way that I still do 
If only you'd never look at me 
The way that you do 
If only you'd never look like that 
When I look at you 
I see face like stone 
Eyes of ice 

Mouth so sweetly telling lies 
I wish you felt the way that I still do 
The way that I still do 
But you don't 
You don't feel anymore 
You don't care anymore 
It's all gone 

If only you'd never pull from me 
The way that you do 
If only you'd never pull like that 
When I'm with you 

I feel hopeless hands helplessly 
Pulling you back close to me 
I wish you felt the way that I still do 
The way that I still do 

If only you'd ever speak to me 
The way you once did 
Look at me the way you once did 
Pull to me the way you once did 

But you don't 
You don't feel anymore 
You don't care anymore 
It's all gone 
It's all gone
