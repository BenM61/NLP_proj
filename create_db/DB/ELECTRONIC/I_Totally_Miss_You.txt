Bad Boys Blue
"I Totally Miss You"
I did you wrong,
My foolish heart went out to play.
And then I lost you,
Oh What a price for me to pay.

Where have you gone,
Baby where you've gone.
Oh I totally miss you,
My heart is painted blue.
I totally miss you,
I can't stop loving you.
So please come back,
(chorus) You'll be making me blue,
Please come back,
(chorus) Why you have promised me the world,
(chorus) But you have made on through.
I totally miss you.

I keep on waiting,
And in my dreams I see a face.
You're still in my life,
No one else can take your place.

Where have you gone,
Baby where you've gone.
Oh I totally miss you,
My heart is painted blue.
I totally miss you,
I can't stop loving you.
So please come back,
(chorus) You'll be making me blue,
Please come back,
(chorus) Why you have promised me the world,
(chorus) But you have made on through.
I totally miss you...I totally miss you.
Oh I totally miss you.

Where have you gone,
Baby where you've gone.
Oh I totally miss you,
My heart is painted blue.
I totally miss you,
I can't stop loving you.
So please come back,
(chorus) You'll be making me blue,
Please come back,
(chorus) Why you have promised me the world,
(chorus) But you have made on through.
Oh I totally miss you...I totally miss you.
