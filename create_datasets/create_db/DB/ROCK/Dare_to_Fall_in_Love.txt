One kiss is a dangerous drug
I'll get what I deserve
If I dare to fall in love

It's the question of the hour
How can I be sure of what I don't know?
She comes to me with a poison in her flower
She steals the miracle of life right out of my hand

As she takes the part of a woman
Most hard to comprehend
And she multiplies by ten

One kiss is a dangerous drug
I'll get what I deserve
If I dare to fall in love
One look? She shot me in cold blood
I'll get what I deserve
If I dare to fall in love

It's the boundary I desire
There is always room enough to feel
Miles and miles of hilly road ahead
And she's got one hand on my heart and one hand on the wheel

And she moves me one step closer
To the deeper end
I may never love again

One kiss is a dangerous drug
I'll get what I deserve
If I dare to fall in love
One look? She shot me in cold blood
I'll get what I deserve
If I dare to fall in love

One by one I take the bitter pills, they're hard to swallow.
I go? Round and round my head is spinning out of control
I will know by tomorrow if I care to live or face another day of sorrow
Holding on to happy ever after

One kiss is a dangerous drug
I'll get what I deserve
If I dare to fall in love
One look? She shot me in cold blood
I'll get what I deserve
If I dare to fall in love
