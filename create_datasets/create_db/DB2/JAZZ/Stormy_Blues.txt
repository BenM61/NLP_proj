I've been down so long
That down don't worry me

I've been down so long
That down don't worry me

I just sit and wonder
Where can my good man be
When it rains in here
It's storming on the sea
When it rains in here
It's storming on the sea

Every time I come here
Everything happens to me
I lose my man
I lose my head
I lose my money
Feel like I'm almost dead
I need you honey
Need you bad as can be

I've been down so long
That down don't worry me
