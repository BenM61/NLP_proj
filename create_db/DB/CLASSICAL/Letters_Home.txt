I'm sorry to put you through all this
I'm sorry that there was no last kiss

'Cos I love you beautiful
I will love you always

Don't cry I know you'll have a wonderful life
Don't cry she'll always be the apple of my eye

'Cos I love you beautiful
I will love you always
'Cos I love you beautiful
I will love you always

I'll see you again
I might be in heaven
You're free to start again
My love will never end

And I'm sorry, to my family and my friends
I thought I'd leave you with a few words again

Oh I love you beautiful
I will love you always
Oh I love you beautiful
I'll always love you always

Oh this is, my letter home
