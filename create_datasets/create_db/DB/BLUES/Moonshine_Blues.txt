I've got to leave this town, I've got to go before the sun goes down 
I've got to leave this town, I've got to go before the sun goes down 
'Cause I done got tired of these coppers running me around 
I stayed in jail last night and all last night before 

I stayed in jail last night and all last night before 
I would have been there now if my daddy hadn't sprung the do' 
I stay in so much trouble, that's why I've got to go 
I stay in so much trouble, that's why I've got to go 

But when I get out this time, I won't sell moonshine no more 
I done packed my trunk and done shipped it on down the road 
I done packed my trunk and done shipped it on down the road 
Now I won't be bothered with these big bad bulls no more 

Just keep me a-moving going from door to door 
Just keep me a-moving going from door to door 
I done made up in my mind not to sell moonshine no more
