Step out, step out of our cages
Step out, of our paper cages
Step out, step out of our cages
Out of our cages, out of our cages
Step out

I like the look of your place
Yes, I love your construction
Did you carve a wee key
From the soap in your kitchen?
To turn in a lock
Of your own penal fiction
You're so vivid and free in your imagination

Well we'll never be free
If our incarceration
Is a story we tell
A tale of invention
Is it personal choice
Personal conviction
Or are you living like me in paper cages?

Step out, step out of our cages
Step out, of our paper cages
Step out, step out of our cages
We're living our lives in paper cages
Step out

When you took on your bid
Did you make up your number?
Did you walk like a punk
To the screws at your counter?
Did you say you can't win
When you are the system
That contains in paper cages?

Step out, step out of our cages
Step out, of our paper cages
Step out, step out of our cages
We're living our lives in paper cages
Step out

Come on!

(Step out!)

Living our lives in paper cages
Living our lives in paper cages
Living our lives in paper cages
Step out

Step out, step out of our cages
Step out, of our paper cages
Step out, step out of our cages
We're living our lives in paper cages
Step out
