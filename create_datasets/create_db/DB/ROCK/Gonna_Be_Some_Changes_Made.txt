Gonna be some changes made

Man was a knife expert
Kinda of a Jim Bowie type,
Swaggerin', blusterin', 'coon skin
I said, "You're not serious, right?"

Then I saw him grab my friend by the hair
And I guess I should have prayed
As he dragged him around, I said to myself,
"There's gonna be some changes made"

(Gonna be some changes made)

Girl I knew and loved alone twenty years from afar
With a finger to her lips she led me out to see the stars
She led me down to the gritty lake and in it we did wade
She took my hand and put it there, gonna be some changes made

(Gonna be)

Gonna
Be some
Changes made
Gonna be some changes made!

(Gonna be some changes made)

Gonna be some changes, changes made
Can't keep on doing what I've been doing these days
Look in the mirror I see a clown's face
Gotta take it off, gotta get myself straight

Gonna be some changes, some changes made
Can't keep on doing what I've been doing these days
Better figure out something
Things are looking grave
Gonna be some changes, changes, changes made

Up in front for all to see
Graceful like a bumblin' fool
Then I thought I felt slip from my mouth a little drool
Maybe no one noticed it
On my mind heavily it weighed
I saw two people snickering
I said "there needs to be some changes made"

Gonna be some, gonna be some changes made

(Gonna be)

Gonna 
Be some
Changes made
Gonna be some changes made!

Gonna be some changes, changes made
Can't keep on doing what I've been doing these days
Look in the mirror I see a clown's face
Some changes made

Going home, I've done enough to sow my little name
Going where the fields are green and I can do my macram
A buffoon fumblin' without a clue, who likes to shift the blame
And often feels betrayed
There's gonna be some changes made

There's gonna be some changes made

Gonna be some changes, changes made
Can't keep on doing what I've been doing these days
Look in the mirror I see a clown's face
Gotta take it off, gotta get myself straight

(Gonna be some changes made)

Gonna be some changes
Gonna be some changes
