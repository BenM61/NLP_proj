Can love be as warm as the ruby
Can love be as pure as the pearl
Just look in the heart of my love for you
You'll find the ruby and the pearl

My love will endure as the diamond
And shine with the shimmer of gold
It glows as the bright star above for you
A thing of beauty to behold

Come close and cling to my kiss
Stay close and share the passion of this
Yes love is as warm as the ruby
And love is as pure as the pearl

Just look in the heart of my love for you
You'll find the ruby and the pearl

Yes love is as warm as the ruby,
And love is as pure as the pearl

Just look in the heart of my love for you
You'll find the ruby and the pearl
