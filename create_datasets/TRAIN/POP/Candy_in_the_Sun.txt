Goin' on a field trip 
Just like school 
Gonna go somewhere that's really cool 
Destination vacation travelin' around the nation 
Hey- the time is now to start the show 
Hey- rev it up and let it go 

'cause I know a place where the sun is always shinin' 
And I won't forget the face 
The one that's gonna keep me smilin' 
You're like candy in the sun 
You're my angel on the run 
You're like candy in the sun 
Hey hey hey 

Speeding down the highway with the top down 
With the top down 
We're gonna get out of this one way town 
Kick it into motion 
Got a notion 
We're gonna drive all the way to the ocean yeah! 
Hey rev it up and let it go 
Hey crankin' up the radio 

'cause I know a place where the sun is always shinin' 
And I won't forget the face 
The one that's gonna keep me smilin' 
You're like candy in the sun 
You're my angel on the run 
You're like candy in the sun 
Hey-hey-hey 

It's time to take a chance 
You know it's true 
Common lets break away 
Just me and you 

'cause I know a place where the sun is always shinin' 
And I won't forget the face 
The one that's gonna keep me smilin' 
You're like candy in the sun 
You're like candy in the sun 
You're like candy in the sun 

'cause I know a place where the sun is always shinin' 
(I know a place) 
And I won't forget the face 
( I won't forget the face) 
The one that's gonna keep me smilin' 
You're like candy in the sun 
You're like candy in the sun 
You're like candy in the sun 
Everyday 
Hey hey hey 
Hey hey hey 
Hey hey hey 
Hey hey hey
