Can't you see my rhythms deep inside 
Singing the songs of love and pride making me want you 
The way that I feel real in my mind, its so good 
Loving me, loving you can't you see that's love that's true 

Chorus: 
Jump into the highways of my heart girl 
Can't you see the --- love is everywhere 
Don't you know baby girl that I love you 
With my heart and I care 

In my mind I can see you and I 
Showing me, loving me as time just goes on by 
Making me love you the way that I know its real 
Can't I prove my love to you, show you that my loves real 

Chorus (2x) 

Highways of love are here deep inside 
Showing you the road of love is what I'm asking for 
I can't take this no more can't you see I adore 
All that you offer to me, I love you more and more 

Chorus (2x)
