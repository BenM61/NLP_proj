What I want, what I need
I can have anything that I want

What I need, what I need, what I want 
What I want, what I need, what I need

I can have anything that I want
But what you want from me I don't what none
And I don't want to watch the TV
Because that stuff don't appeal to me

But what I want's got simplicity
What I want it wants only me
What I want don't say no at all
Listen blue eyes, shut up
You've got what I want, what I want
What I need, what I need
What I want what I want
What I need, what I need
You have got it all

Well I know how to have a good time
And I know how to wipe up the thin white line
And I know how to let my backbone slip (uh)
I can do what I want but I don't do nothing

But what I want's got simplicity
What I want it wants only me
What I want don't say no at all
Listen blue eyes, shut up
You've got what I want, what I want
What I need, what I need
What I want what I want
What I need, what I need
You have got it all

But what I want's got simplicity
What I want it wan't me, me, me
What I want well it ain't plucked chicken
Listen blue eyes, shut up
You've got what I want
