How many times do I have to tell you
That you're the person that I adore?
How many times do I have to tell you
And not repeat what I have said before?

How many ways can I say I miss you
And skip the ever familiar rhymes?
How many times do I have to kiss you?
Don't make it less than a million times

I've said over and over and over and over again
That you are my one obsession
But I'd be willing to say it again and again
If I thought it would make an impression

How many dreams do I have to sell you
To make the one in my heart come true?
How many times do I have to tell you
Before you know I'm in love with you?

How many dreams do I have to sell you
To make the one in my heart come true?
How many times do I have to tell you
Before you know I'm in love with you?
