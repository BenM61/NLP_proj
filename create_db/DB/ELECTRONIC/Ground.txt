Be still
Though chaos rains around you now 
Only so much rain can fall at once 
Breathe in
And let the air envelope you 
And slow but sure, serenity will come 

Close your eyes 
Try to breathe 
Feel the ground beneath your feet
It's still there 
The world still turns around 

Stand up 
Though circumstance has knocked you down 
There is nothing gained by staying within it's reach

Take strength
In every failure you endure
Our mistakes have many lessons they can teach 

Close your eyes 
Try to breathe 
Feel the ground beneath your feet
It's still there 
The world still turns around 

Destroy 
These walls you've built around yourself 
You can't take another step until they're gone 

Move out 
No use in dwelling in the past 
Bid farewell to all your fears and carry on 

Close your eyes 
Try to breathe 
Feel the ground beneath your feet
It's still there 
The world still turns around
