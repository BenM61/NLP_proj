Every river searches for the sea
Every life runs it's own destiny
Canyons white and wild stretches calm and mild
Cutting through the stones of history

Rio Grande runs south to Mexico
From the highway I have touched its shores
Reynosa to Sante Fe and back the other way
I've had my life planned by the Rio Grande

An unbroken chain snow and tears and rain
Cutting through my soul and to my veins
Then the waters rise paint the Rocky Mountain skies
One more circle around the world again

One more year rolls down the Rio Grande
Our forefathers crossed the muddy line
Pilgrims passing leaving tracks in time
One more takes a stand by the water by the land

Shifting like the sand by the Rio Grande
An unbroken chain snow and tears and rain
Cutting through my soul and to my veins
Then the waters rise paint the Rocky Mountain skies

One more circle around the world again
One more year rolls down the Rio Grande
One more circle around the world again
One more year rolls down the Rio Grande
