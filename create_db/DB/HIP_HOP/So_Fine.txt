This is for all these 
Special people whom God has created 
Who he put on this Earth 
So beautiful indeed... 
The woman 

Such a beautiful lady 
The kind you find in a dream 
And dreams are so real for me 
With eyes so warm and soothing 
They put me in a trance 
And I imagine us by the warm cozy fireplace 
The light shines on your face 
Your smile gets me higher and higher 
My heart starts to race 
I gotta say what I feel 
'Cause girl you look so good to me 

[Chorus:]
So fine lady 
So fine you sway me 
So fine lady 
So fine you sway me 

Can't believe my eyes 
Take me for a ride 
Such a woman of quality 
Your body's so supreme 
When you dance you sway so elegantly 
Girl you simply dazzle me 
You put me in a trance 

And I imagine you and me 
Just kissin' away 
My fingers in your hair 
Your embrace holds tighter and tighter 
Your touch makes me say 
I gotta stop to look 
'Cause girl you look so damn good to me 

[Chorus x 2]
