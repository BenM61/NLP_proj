You simply can't forget her
The moment you have met her
Your heart will never ever be the same

Tina, Tina, nobody else but Tina
That's the little lady's name
And once you've gone and kissed her
Give up you can't resist her
Your thoughts will wear her picture like a frame

Tina, Tina, nobody quite like Tina
That's the little lady's name
She'll merely smile and in a twinkling
You'll swear that smile contains a star
Before that smile you had no inkling
How much in love you really are

Let others look for angels
I have no time for angels
I've found someone more than just divine
Tina, Tina, no sir you can't have Tina
Tina is mine all mine, Tina is mine all mine
