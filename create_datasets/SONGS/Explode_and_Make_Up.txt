Heart holds mouth to words
Said it's gone beyond the line this time
Eyes twitch close
Numb the lights turned out I'm out

The cold is in my bones
Said it's gone beyond the line this time
Shake a little off the deep end
Tell me when it's over now

I hate you
Explode and make up
Threw it in the yard
Burned it in an ashtray
I don't need you
Even though it's all made up
Put it in your box and put it

Show me how you been
Said it's been so long, I don't recall
Used to be this way
That's the way it always seems to go

Tired and walked away
Said it's far when you don't have a place to go
Where'd you go
Tell me where am I supposed to go

Here we go, here we go again
There you go, there you go again

As the years
They go slowly bye and bye goodbye
After you, lead the way
