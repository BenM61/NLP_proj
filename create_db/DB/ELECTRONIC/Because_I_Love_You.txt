I got your letter
From the postman
Just the other day
So I decided
To write you this song
Just to let you know
Exactly the way I feel
To let you know
My love's for real
Because I love you
And I'll do anything
I'll give you my heart
My everything
Because I love you
I'll be right by your side
To be alive
To be your guy
If you should feel
That I don't really care
And that you're starting to lose ground
Just let me reassure you
That you can count on me
And that I will always be around
Because I love you
My heart's an open door
Girl, won't you please come on in
Because I love you
I'll be right by your side
To be alive
To be your guy
If you should feel
That I don't really care
And that you're starting to lose ground
Just let me reassure you
That you can count on me
And that I will always be around
Because I love you
My heart's an open door
Girl, won't you please come on in
Because I love you
I'll be right by your side
To be alive
To be your guy
