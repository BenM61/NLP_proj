From a place that had no meaning
From the wilderness of time
To the land of new beginning
Starting with a new design
Never doubted for a second
That I'd do it on my own
And I held onto my corner
Trusted in the things I know 

You will never feel
How good it is to love me
Rather than control me
I don't need the world weighing down my shoulders
But that's all over here I am

I made it back
From a place called nowhere
I made it back
To do this once again
I made it back
From a place called nowhere
I made it back
Once again I made it back
 
Got a chance to fix up neatly
Set it off and not too late
Saw the light and walked towards it
I'm the master of my late
Coming up just wasn't easy
It took all the strength I had
Now I'm ready for the action
Mamma got a brand nu bag

You will never feel
How good it is to love me
Rather than control me
I don't need the world weighing down my shoulders
But that's all over here I am

I made it back
From a place called nowhere
I made it back
To do this once again
I made it back
From a place called nowhere
I made it back
Once again I made it back
 
Got a chance to fix up neatly
Set it off and not too late
Saw the light and walked towards it
I'm the master of my late
Coming up just wasn't easy
It took all the strength I had
Now I'm ready for the action
Mamma got a brand nu bag

Flava, flava, flava
Brand new flava, flava flava
