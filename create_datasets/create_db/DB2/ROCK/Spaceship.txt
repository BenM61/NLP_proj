When you gonna grow up?
Momma always said
Are you gonna walk around with a silly grin
And a bubble on your head?
A spaceship landed by the mall
There was a big parade, everybody got laid
And they burned all the books and the Chevrolets
And they grow so fast they never crawl

If you get tired of satellite fliers
And fame has let you down
Under the wire and over the moon
I'm alive

When you gonna grow up?
Momma always said
But I just want to walk around with a dollar bill
And a coat that never sheds
A spaceship landed on the water
It was a holiday for the underpaid
Everybody got a haircut and lemonade
And they smiled just like it was their father

If you get tired of satellite fliers
And fame has let you down
Under the wire and over the moon
I'm alive
I'm alive

Play me a (tune)
One for my radio
One for my love that came and went
So many stories
Hey man I'm sorry
This is just a song to pay the rent
To pay the rent

If you get tired of satellite fliers
And fame has let you down
Under the wire and over the moon
I'm alive

When you gonna grow up?
When you gonna grow up?
When you gonna grow up?
When you gonna grow up?
