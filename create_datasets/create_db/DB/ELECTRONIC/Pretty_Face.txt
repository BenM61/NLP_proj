I see my pretty face in his old eyes
I listen to our blood run side by side
I throw my hands to you and run away
It's so cold, so dangerous that I can't stay

I ran away from you 
Into your dream 
The one
That I was in when you 
Told me 
That I could never meet 
My friend 
Again

I thought I had touched them but I can't feel 
I'm in your dream
They want to take me but I will hide from them
Tonight I'll take your life and throw it far away
I'll use my pretty face to find my way to him

I ran away from you 
Into your dream 
The one
That I was in when you 
Told me 
That I could never meet 
My friend 
Again

Will you be my friend in my dream?
Take that pretty face off show me
Will we ever have that baby?
Just take your pretty face off, show me

Are you my friend?
