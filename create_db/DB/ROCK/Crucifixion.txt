Crucifixion they called the game
Bestial penalty, a deadly maim
Crucifixion, the way that sinners go
Holy torment, last malice ya got to know

Crucifixion, crucifixion
Bloody Hell, I won't die here
Crucifixion, crucifixion
I'm blood covered in pain an' fear

Hundreds of years they raised the cross
Evil dark priests, black stones they toss
The bible, it praises that bloody wood
A priest, he prays with an uncanny hood

Rusty nails sended them straight to hell
Ill treated, they just got their souls to sell
Crucifixion, the way that sinners go
Holy torment, last malice ya got to know
