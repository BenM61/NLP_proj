It used to seem to me that my life ran on too fast
And I had to take it slowly just to make the good parts last
But when you're born to run it's so hard to just slow down
So don't be surprised to see me back in the bright part of town

I'll be back in the high life again
All the doors I closed one time will open up again
I'll be back in the high life again
All the eyes that watched me once, will smile and take me in

You used to be the best to make life be life to me
And I hope that you're still out there and you're like you used to be
We'll have ourselves a time
And we'll dance till the morning sun
And we'll let the good times come in
And we won't stop till we're done

We'll be back in the high life again
All the doors I closed one time will open up again
We'll be back in the high life again
All the eyes that watched us once will smile and take us in

And we'll drink and dance with one hand free
And have the world so easily 
And oh we'll be a sight to see
Back in the high life again

High life
High life
In the high life again

We'll be back in the high life again
All the doors I closed one time will open up again
We'll be back in the high life again
All the eyes that watched us once, will smile and take us in

And we'll drink and dance with one hand free
And have the world so easily 
And oh we'll be a sight to see
Back in the high life again

High life (back in the high life)
Oh we'll be back
