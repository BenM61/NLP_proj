Hello... are you still there?
This long silence is more than I can bear
I know it seems we ain't got much to say 
But can you try to hear me out anyway?

This space between us just keeps on growing
We both know where we been,
But that ain't where we're going
I can see it in your eyes, girl, that you're wonderin'
Will our love still stand the test?

The answer is yes... Yes (Yes), Yes (Yes), Yes
The answer is yes... Yes (Yes), Yes (Yes), Yes 

Hold on, you're breaking up
There's so much static between the two of us
You say I'm trippin', I say you've changed
Maybe we both need to stop playing these silly games

We gotta open up and tell the truth
Just be real with me and I promise I'll be real with you
If you're still wondering if I'll be there when you need me girl, 
You'll never have to guess

The answer is yes... Yes (Yes), Yes (Yes), Yes
The answer is yes... Yes, (Yes) Yes, (Yes) Yes

Will I hear you call? (Yes)
Catch you when you fall? (Yes)
The answer is yes!
Will I always care? (Yes)
Will I still be there? (yes)

I could write a thousand songs for you, I'd still be short a word or two
As the years go on, will my love stay strong?
Will I be there to give you my best?

Yes! Yes... Yes... Yes
The answer is yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

Will I still be the one (Yes!) when it's all said and done... (Yes!)
Will my love for you stay strong?
Will we stand the test, 'til our very last breath? (Yes!)
Will I be there as the years go on? (Yes!)

Yes! 
Oh, yes!
