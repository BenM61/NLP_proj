Been training dogs again 
To bite your little princess 
And making sure they make a scene 
Running errands all the way 
Communicate in codes 
You've just gotta make the in-roads 

Holding on, to what you've got 
Making plans, just to stay alive 
Doing time, oh you bet you will 
I'm doing mine, by the side of the road 
Making out, 'cause I'm making good 
What it's all about, like I said I would 
Then you realize, well, look who's laughing now 

We take pride in our work 
The key's the execution 
And, hey that's what we had in mind 
But we're not just having fun 
I wouldn't want to be ya 
Cause we're drawing blood if we see ya 

And we're not afraid to use animals 
Or anything else that'll tear itself a hole 
Yeah we'll be just like dumb fucking animals 
If that's the kind of game you want to play
