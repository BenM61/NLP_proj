Every morning when sun is dawning   
You'll see him down on the beach   
Look out girl, beware   
Better take good care   
Keep yourself out of reach   
He's out to make a killing girl   
He's out to make a score   
And maybe if you're willing girl   
He's gonna ask for more     
Oh oh Figaro, He's got magic oh oh   
Oh oh Figaro, He's a Romeo oh     
See him down on the beach   
He'll be looking for someone new   
Searching down on the beach   
Figaro, Figaro     
When he plays guitar   
At the disco bar   
He's the star of the show   
As the girls go by   
He just winks an eye   
See those pretty girls glow   
He's out to make a killing girl   
When dancing on the floor   
And maybe if you're willing girl   
He's gonna ask for more     
Oh oh Figaro, He's got magic oh oh   
Oh oh Figaro, He's a Romeo oh     
See him down on the beach   
He'll be looking for someone new   
Searching down on the beach   
Figaro, Figaro     
Oh oh Figaro, He's got magic oh oh   
Oh oh Figaro, He's a Romeo oh   
Oh oh Figaro, He's got magic oh oh   
Oh oh Figaro, He's a Romeo oh
