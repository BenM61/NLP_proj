Everytime I meet you at the feet of Eros 
We'll be in our street clothes and pretend we've never 
Met 
And I will tell you My name is Angel 
When you call me Angel I'll freeze like a statuette 
And they will point and say I look very real 

Yes they will 
I guess we all take turns on the water wheel 
Baby last night you made me think now strike me pink 
Maybe you'll bring me a lucky streak 
Well strike me pink 

So what if our love is tragic part of a missing link? 
Baby your touch is magic 
You strike me pink 

I know that I'm in for a rude awakening 
Only you can make me come from behind the door 
Is it me or the earth that's shaking 

Only you can make me still come back for more 
And they will point and say I look very real yes they 
Will 
I guess we all take turns on the water wheel 
And they will point and say I look very real yes they 
Will 
I guess we all have turns on the wonder wheel 
Baby last night you made me think now strike me pink 
Maybe you'll bring me a lucky streak 
Well strike me pink 

So what if our love is tragic part of a missing link? 
Baby your touch is magic 
You strike me pink
