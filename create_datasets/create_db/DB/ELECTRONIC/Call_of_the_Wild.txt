Outside wild winds are calling
Broken leaves are falling

Outside wild winds are calling
Broken leaves are falling
Like I fall before you
Outside nightfall is returning
Our home fires are burning
Like I burn before you

Wind and rain may blow
Will we watch them come and go

Don't go, and in my heart
I held you just for a while
Don't go, and in my eyes
I see the love of a child
Don't go, you can't deny
You feel the call of the wild
(Call of the wild)

In your hand a heart is falling
A howling wolf is calling
And it's calling your name
And before the night is ending
The message that it's sending
Will it all be in vain

Say that you will stay
And we'll watch them come and go

Don't go, and in my heart
I held you just for a while
Don't go, and in my eyes
I see the love of a child
Don't go, you can't deny
You feel the call of the wild
(Call of the wild)

As the wailing winds are calling
And the broken leaves are falling
And the magic that surrounds you
I will build a world around you

Don't go, and in my heart
I held you just for a while
Don't go, and in my eyes
I see the love of a child
Don't go, you can't deny
You feel the call of the wild

Don't go, and in my heart
I held you just for a while
Don't go, and in my eyes
I see the love of a child
Don't go, you can't deny
You feel the call of the wild
(Call of the wild)
