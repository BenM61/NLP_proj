Well it's christmastime everybody
But it's raining in my heart
Yes it's christmastime everybody
But it's raining in my heart
Well you know that i love you baby
Tell me why must we be apart

Well you told me new year's eve
That we'd be together christmastime
Well you told me new year's eve
That we'd be together at christmastime
Well it's christmas eve my darling
Will you be here when the bell
Begins to chime

Okay

What is a ship without a cre-ew
What is the morning without the de-ew baby
What's a ship without a cre-ew
What is the morning without the de-ew baby
What is my life little darling
Another lonely christmas
Without you
