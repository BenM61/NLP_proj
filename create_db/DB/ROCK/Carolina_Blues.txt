Trying to make a train by sunrise gonna have to run a red light
Trying to make a train by sunrise gonna have to run a red light
Tangling with my Carolina you know the girl kept me up all night
And when my Carolina throw down you know the girl knows how to fight

Don't think we're gonna make it there's nothing else that anyone can do
Don't think we're gonna make it there's nothing else that anyone can say
Almost got the feeling that Carolina's liking it that way
I'm waiting on the train man, to wait and take the pain away

All aboard
All aboard
All aboard
All aboard

Wait for me
Wait for me
Wait for me
Wait for me

Train man kept his promise gonna try and go on back to bed
Train man kept his promise gonna try and go on back to bed
Can't sleep anyway thinking 'bout what my Carolina said
And oh my Carolina running like a freight train through my head
