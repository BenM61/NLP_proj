Going out each day to score, she was no whore but for me
Celebrating every day the way she thought it should be

And I don't know what to do
Now that pink has turned to blue
And I don't know what to do
Now that pink has turned to blue

She was always by my side and never tried to leave
Standing up for me and like a tree for what she believed

And I don't know what to do
Now that pink has turned to blue
And I don't know what to do
Now that pink has turned to blue

Don't know what to do
Now that pink has turned to blue
I don't know what to do
Now that pink has turned to blue

No more rope and too much dope, she's lying on the bed
Angels pacing, gently placing roses 'round her head

And I don't know what to do
Now that pink has turned to blue
Now I don't know what to do
Now that pink has turned to blue

And I don't know what to do
Now that pink has turned to blue
Now I don't know what to do
