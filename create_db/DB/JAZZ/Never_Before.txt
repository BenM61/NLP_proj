Never before has my heart felt a thrill like this
Never before
Never before
Never before has the whole world stood still like this
As I gaze at the face I simply adore
After today when they speak of our paradise
I'll smile and I'll say I've been there once or twice
For this is that once in a lifetime
The miracle of your kiss
I've never loved like this
Never before

After today when they speak of our paradise
I'll smile and I'll say I've been there once or twice
For this is that once in a lifetime
The miracle of your kiss
I've never loved like this
Never before
