My fur coat's sold
Oh Lord ain't it cold
But I'm not gonna holler
Cause I've still got a dollar
And when I get low
Oh, I get high

My man walked out
Now you know that ain't right
He better watch out
If I meet him tonight
I said when I get low
Oh, I get high

All this hard luck in this town has found me
Nobody knows but the troubles are all around me

Oh, I'm all alone
With no one to pet me
My old rocking chair
Ain't never gonna get me
Cause when I get low
Oh, I get high

When I get low
Oh, I get high
