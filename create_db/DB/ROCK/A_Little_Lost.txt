Oh I'm a little lost
Without you
That may be an understatement
And I hope I've paid the cost
To let a day go on by
And not call on you

'Cause I'm so busy, I'm so busy
Thinking about kissing you
'Cause I'm so busy, I'm so busy
Thinking about touching you
Now I want to do that
Without entertaining another thought

Now I'm out on the ocean surf
I'll have to pull myself together
But it's hard, I'm not on my turf
It's just me and those big old waves
Rolling in

'Cause I'm so busy, so busy
Thinking about kissing you
'Cause I'm so busy, I'm so busy
Thinking about touching you
Now I want to do that
Without entertaining another thought

I'm so unfinished
Our love affair
A voice in me is telling me to
Run away, run away
Our love affair
A voice in me is telling me to
I'm so offended
Our love affair
A voice in me is telling me to
Run run away, run run away
Run run away

Oh I'm a little lost
Without you
That may be an understatement
And I hope your feeling hasn't gone
I hope you need somebody in your life
Someone like me

'Cause I'm so busy, I'm so busy
Thinking about kissing you
'Cause I'm so busy, I'm so busy
Thinking about touching you
'Cause I'm so busy, I'm so busy
Thinking about kissing you
'Cause I'm so busy, I'm so busy
Thinking about touching you

Now I want to do that
Without entertaining another thought
