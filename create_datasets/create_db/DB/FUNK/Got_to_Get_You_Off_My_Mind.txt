Oh Yeah, Yeah
Sad story, baby
Every word is true

Got to get you off my mind
I know its just a matter of time
You found somebody new
Our romance is true

Now lister to me, baby
I am gonna throw your picture away
You didn't want my love in any old way
I know found somebody new
Our romance is true

And that's why I baby
I got to get off a my mind
Cause I know it's just a matter of time
Took my love and my money too, baby
Our romance is true

But wait a minute, darling
Some folks love is hard and strong
Baby, that's the kind a love it lingers on
Some folks love is well it's swift and thin
And that's the kind of love that never last
We had love it was right in between
And to me it was like a dream
We had the faith together till doom
And our fathers and mothers too

And that's why I, baby
I got to get off a my mind
I know it's just a matter of time
I know you found somebody new
Our romance is true

But now I opend up my eyes
And I finally realize 
I saw it slipping away

And that's why I, baby
I got to get off a my mind
I know it's just a matter of time
You found somebody new
Our romance is true

It's all over, baby
Our romance is true
Boodbye darling

You broke my heart, baby
Yes you did
