Somewhere beyond where the light rarely goes
Somewhere beyond where the dark barely breathes
Somewhere this night where the dark only knows

She awaits ever patient
She awaits rarely seen
But her moments are taken
For in the dead of the night
Gathering light
Christmas dreams

I want to wrap all my moments around her
I want to watch as she glitters the night
Floats her dreams in the air
People watch, children stare
At these tears of captured light

While she awaits ever patient
She awaits rarely seen
S'Till her moments are taken
For in the dead of the night
Gathering light
Christmas dreams

And a tear falls upon her snow-white hair
And it runs to the end where it lingers there
Then it falls through the air of a winter's sky
'Till it captures a dream and it's crystallized

Let it go
Let it go
This old world that I know

For soon everything will be changing
In a single glance
Where it all enchants
And every hope is worth saving

And a tear falls upon her snow-white hair
And it runs to the end where it lingers there
Then it falls through the air of a winter's sky
'Till it captures a dream and it's crystallized

Let it go
Let it go
This old world that I know

For soon everything will be changing
In a single glance
Where it all enchants
And every hope
Every hope
Every hope is worth saving
