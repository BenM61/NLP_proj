For all we know
We may never meet again
Before you go
Make this moment sweet again
We won't say goodbye
Until the last minute
I might hold out my hand
Check, 'cause my heart's gonna be in it

Oh, for all we know
This may only be a dream
We come and we go
Like a ripple on a stream
So love me tonight
Tomorrow was made for some
Tomorrow may never come, oh
For all we know
So love, love me tonight
Tomorrow was made for some
Tomorrow may never come
For all we know
