You know that I love you
And I try to treat you nice and kind
But you gone and left me, baby
And I'm about to lose my mind

I gave you my love and my money, baby
But the life you lead was one big lie
No matter what I did for you, daddy
I never seemed to satisfy

Tell me, tell me, baby
What have I done to you
Yes, you mistreat me, baby
That's why I'm singing this lonesome blues

So long, so long, baby
I know that we are through
I've got a brain you lover daddy
And I've got no use for you
