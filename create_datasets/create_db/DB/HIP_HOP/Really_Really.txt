Diamonds really diamonds
And I'm shining bright 'cause I'm really grinding
They ask me if I'm real
I say is you serious?
My daughter gone love this bitch here

All my diamonds shine 'cause they really diamonds
Bad bitches in line, they be really trying
They ask me if I'm high
I say really really
Got money on my mind
I say really really
I look like I been balling 'cause I'm really balling
I won't apologize
I'm not really sorry
They ask me if I'm lying
I say really really
I'm really out my mind
I say really really
Really really

Make 'em believe I made 'em believe
A lyrical song writer and he can sing
Bringing in money like I'm raking leaves
I was just trying to get paper to sneeze
Achooo
That was a blessing
She special to you
I don't look at her special
Actually I treat her regular
Not being seen, we not making no spectacle
Gates had her first then he gave her to Kevin
All the above we do all the etcetera
Scared of the feds, had to switch up my cellular
He talking reckless don't call me back ever
Passing thru Gardere to holler at Glover
Shout out to Black
Shout out to Cedric
Grey Monte Carlo, cocaine 911
Just hollered at Trap
I'm like the Reverend
My section ridiculous
Watch where you stepping
Pockets on envy, you can't be to careful
Steve like 'em tall
And when they yellow
Working in college
Fresh with low mileage
I like 'em black
Pretty white teeth
Body unique
Booty on fleek
Jhene Aiko
Chewing her cheeks
Groceries please
You know that was me

All my diamonds shine 'cause they really diamonds
Bad bitches in line, they be really trying
They ask me if I'm high
I say really really
Got money on my mind
I say really really
I look like I been balling 'cause I'm really balling
I won't apologize
I'm not really sorry
They ask me if I'm lying
I say really really
I'm really out my mind
I say really really
Really really

Dyin' can be treacherous
Pray to God that don't nobody mess with us
Keep it strong in case anyone testing us
Right or wrong if it's diss you don't mess with it
When yo bitch over here I don't mess with her
No detective work I don't be questioning
Where she been, trying to read all of her messages
I don't speak on no man that's irregular
Take her phone disconnecting her cellular
What you need that for undressing
What you need that for caressing her
Spreading her legs 'bout to pleasure her
Pulling her hair from the back
Go to pressing her
Trying to see who tap first made a bet with her
Relationship flaking, no eczema
She catching feelings she say we inseparable
Oyster Perpetual
It's not a replica
Mustang GT in the streets smoking vegetables
Trunk in the front do it make me a elephant
I really really put syrup in my beverages
Shopping in Beverly
Check out my etiquette
Loving my swag
Women tailor keep checking it
Carats they glisten in all of my necklaces
Feeling myself
Really thought it was evident

All my diamonds shine 'cause they really diamonds
Bad bitches in line, they be really trying
They ask me if I'm high
I say really really
Got money on my mind
I say really really
I look like I been balling 'cause I'm really balling
I won't apologize
I'm not really sorry
They ask me if I'm lying
I say really really
I'm really out my mind
I say really really
Really really
