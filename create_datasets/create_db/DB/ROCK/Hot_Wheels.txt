They're riding on since '72
All their life on the freeway
They have no fear for nothing at all
They're always doing it their way

Flying with the wind
Chromed steel and dressed in leather
Live to ride, ride to live
Too wild to be tamed forever
Yeah!

Hot wheels, riding on the highway
Hot wheels, 'coloured' riders of the storm
Hot wheels, always doing in their way
Hot wheels, no break from dusk till dawn
Hot wheels

All for one and one for all
The engine roars like thunder
The bike's filled up with gasoline
Exploding with it's power

Flying with the wind
Chromed steel and dressed in leather
(They) live to ride, ride to live
Too wild to ? forever

Hot wheels, riding on the highway
Hot wheels, 'coloured' riders of the storm
Hot wheels, always doing in their way
Hot wheels, no break from dusk till dawn
Hot wheels

Yeah!
Hot wheels, riding on the highway
Hot wheels, 'coloured' riders of the storm
Hot wheels, always doing in their way
Hot wheels, no break from dusk till dawn

Hot wheels, riding on the highway
Hot wheels, 'coloured' riders of the storm
Hot wheels, always doing in their way
Hot wheels, no break from dusk till dawn
(Hot wheels)

Hot wheels, all for one, one for all
Hot wheels, can you feel the thunder
(Hot wheels)
Yeah, ride to live
Hot wheels
