Good morning my child
Stay with me a while
You not got any place to be
Won't you sit a spell with me

You've got diamonds for eyes
It's time for you to rise
And evaporate 
In the sun
Sometimes it can weigh 
A ton

Keep all your crows away
Hold skinny wolves at bay
In silver piles of smiles
May all your days be gold my child

A necklace of leaves
Spirits in the trees
And drown all the clocks 'til there's none
Little ambient in the sun

Keep all your crows away
Hold skinny wolves at bay
In silver piles of smiles
May all your days be gold my child

Ha-ah, ha-ah, ha-ah, hah-ahh

Good morning my child
Stay with me a while
And evaporate in the sun
Sometimes it can weigh a ton

Keep all your crows away
Hold skinny wolves at bay
In silver piles of smiles
May all your days be gold my child
May all your days be gold my child
May all your days be gold my child
May all your days be gold my child
