I know I'm not the only flower you see 
But what can I do, you are a good looking bee 
Wham bam, thank you mam 

[Chorus]
Bumble bee, bump into me 
I am in for pollination 
Bumble bee, take what you see 
I'm in need for your donation 
I can't wait for your invasion 

Be my love 
'Cause I'm a single flower, feeling free 
Blooming now 
Take me honey, be my favorite bee 

Hey Rose I'm ready again 
I've got my radar tuned in on you baby 
I'm all set and ready to land 
I'm the bum , here I come 
Getting ready for a wham bam 

[Chorus]

Wham bam, thank you mam 
I'm going wham bam, thank you mam 
I'm a true believer, that goes for what I see 
And one little flower is not enough for a bee, like me 

All I know 
Is you're my honey, and I can't say no 
Just a little bit shy 
And so excited, when I see you fly 

Hey Rose I'm ready again 
I've got my radar tuned in on you baby 
I'm all set and ready to land 
I'm the bum, here I come 
Getting ready for a wham bam 

[Chorus]

Wham bam,thank you mam 
I'm going wham bam, thank you mam 
I'm a true believer, that goes for what I see 
And one little flower is not enough for a bee 
No, one little flower is not enough for a bee, like me 

I know I'm not the only flower you see 
But what can I do, you are a good looking bee 
Honey, it's a job, it's a dream come true 
You're my favourite flower, when I'm intimate with you 

Wham bam, thank you mam 
I'm going wham bam, thank you mam 
I'm going wham bam, thank you mam 
I'm a true believer, that goes for what I see 
And one little flower is not enough for a bee 

Going wham bam, thank you mam 
I'm going wham bam, thank you mam 
I'm a true believer, that goes for what I see 
And you, my flower ain't enough for me 
You got to be faithful, it's not fair for a bee 
You got to be faithful, it's not fair for a bee, like me
