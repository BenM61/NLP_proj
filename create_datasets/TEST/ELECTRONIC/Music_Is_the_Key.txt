People, have always been singing
To wipe away tears, to ease all the pain (Oh)
Music, has always been healing
Some people just sometimes, 
And others again and again and again
So we hope, that today you are ready, 
To understand

Whenever you're falling down
Hopeless and pushed around
Find your own melody 
Trust me that music is the key
It makes you feel proud and strong
Helps you to carry on
If you are down on your knees
You should sing it with me
Music is the key
(Sets you free, yes)

Stories, we've always been telling
Its part of our nature to speak with a friend
So we hope that today you are ready, 
To understand

Whenever you're falling down
Hopeless and pushed around
Find your own melody 
Trust me that music is the key
It makes you feel proud and strong
Helps you to carry on
If you are down on your knees
You should sing it with me
Music is the key

It's the key to the heart of all people
It can open the door to your soul
It's the key to the world
Where the flower of love always grows
Don't you know
Don't you know

Whenever you're falling down
Hopeless and pushed around
Find your own melody 
Trust me that music is the key
Whenever you're losing faith
Just want to leave the place
Come sing along with me
Trust me that music is the key
Just sing with me loud and strong
Help us to carry on
If you are down on your knees
You should sing it with me
Music is the key
Sets you free
Music is the key
