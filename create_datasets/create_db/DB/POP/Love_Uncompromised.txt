I'll make you up then, I'll dress you down
And I'm gonna kiss you all over this time
And I'm gonna teach your love a lesson
Cause baby your everything I've been missing

So kiss me with your heart, 
Touch me with your eyes, 
Love me with your soul, I'll never compromise
Holding your hand, shouldering your pain, 
I'll give you love like a year of rainy days oh

I wake you up with a little bit of feeling
I open the blinds, you open your eyes
The way you make them shine makes me feel so alive
Baby you're so mine

So kiss me with your heart, 
Touch me with your eyes, 
Love me with your soul I'll never compromise
Holding your hand, shouldering your pain, 
I'll give you love like a year, like a year, of rainy days.

So kiss me with your heart, 
Touch me with your eyes, 
Love me with your soul never compromise
Your hand, your pain, I'll give you love like rainy days.

Like a year of rainy days
Like rainy days
Like a year of rainy days
Like rainy days
Like a year of rainy days

I'll make you up then I'll dress you down
