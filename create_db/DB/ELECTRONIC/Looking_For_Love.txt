I was alone thinkin' I was just fine
I wasn't lookin' for anyone to be mine
I thought love was just a fabrication
A train that wouldn't stop at my station

Home, alone, that was my consignment
Solitary confinement
So when we met I was skirting around you

I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you (3x)
I didn't know I was looking for love (2x)

'cause there I stood and I would
Oh I wonder could I say what I felt
And not be misunderstood
A thousand stars came into my system
I never knew how much I had missed them

Slap on my map on my heart you landed
I was coy but you made me candid
And now the planets circle around you

I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you baby(3x)
I didn't know I was looking for love (2x)

So we build from here with love the foundation
In a world of tears, one consolation
Now you're here there's a full brass band
Playin' in me like a wonderland
And if you left I would be two foot small
And every tear would be a waterfall
Soundless boundless I surround you

I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you
I just didn't know

I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you
I didn't know I was looking for love

I just didn't know
until I found you baby
until I found you
I didn't know I was looking for love
Until I found you
