What would they say if we up and ran away
From the roaring crowd
And the worn out city faces
Would they carry on and on
When they found out we were gone
Or would they let us go
Would they tag along or would they just...

Leave us alone, wed live in the country
Leave us alone, wed make it just fine
Happy in a one-room shack
And wed not look back
Now would we

What would they do if they found out we were through
With the little lies and the downtown aggravations
That we traded them away for a quiet country day
That we had hoped to share
Would they try to find out where we were, or...

What would they say if we up and ran away
