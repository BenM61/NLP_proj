Abadabadango can you hear
It's the rhythm of the heart
That beats for a million years
We all have to use some kind of magic
Some of the time
Between the laughter and the tears
A place to draw the line
When they say that you can't
Say that you won't
So don't even give it a try
I know hard as it seems
To take all your dreams
And give 'em just one more time
Abadabadango can you hear
It's the rhythm of the heart
That beats for a million years
Abadabadango getting loud and clear
If you listen close to voice inside
That you wait to hear
It's the time we spend awake at night
A dream that you've had before
Visions pounding in your head
That you just can't ignore
And are we sometimes blinded by
Stars get in our eyes
Break someone's heart
Falling apart
Then start again one more time
Abadabadango can you hear
It's the rhythm of the heart
That beats for a million years
Abadabadango getting loud and clear
If you listen close to voice inside
That you wait to hear
Abadabadango can you hear
It's the rhythm of the heart
That beats for a million years
Abadabadango getting loud and clear
If you listen close to voice inside
That you wait to hear
