You've got no money, but you got it all
And we can take it if you want
You think that time, goes on and on
You got the whole world on a wrong
Say it loud, shout it out
Time for us to make a sound
Shout it out, loud and clear
For everyone to hear
Believe it, believe it
Believe it, believe it
And the whole world's standing next to you
And the whole world's watching over you
Believe it, believe it
Believe it, believe it
Love tomorrow, but forget today
But it won't always be that way
Chasing something, that you've never seen
But it's closer than you think
Say it loud, shout it out
Time for us to make a sound
Shout it out, loud and clear
For everyone to hear
Believe it, believe it
Believe it, believe it
And the whole world's standing next to you
And the whole world's watching over you
Believe it, believe it
Believe it, believe it
You've got no money, but you got it all
And we can take it as you want
You think that time, goes on and on
You got the whole world on a wrong
Say it loud, shout it out
Time for us to make a sound
Shout it out, loud and clear
For everyone to hear
Believe it, believe it
Believe it, believe it
And the whole world's standing next to you
And the whole world's watching over you
And the whole world's standing next to you
And the whole world's watching over you
Believe it, believe it
Believe it, believe it
Believe it, believe it
Believe it, believe it
