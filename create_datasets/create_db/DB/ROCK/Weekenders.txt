I am only half a day away
Weekenders we were in no but name
I thought we had control of God His strength
Curiosity had tricked us all the same

I still hear you call
And you turn around in vain
I still hear you call
And I thought I heard my name
I still hear you call
That it?s me I end up facing
I still hear you call
As you ever walk away

Plating sweats to spill is always more
Want to tell you what it?s soathing for
Why do you chip from you to pass your mind
To sell your soul, you even sold your heart

I still hear you call
And you turn around in vain
I still hear you call
And I thought I heard my name
I still hear you call
That it?s me I end up facing
I still hear you call
As you ever walk away

I need you
I need you

This is no-ones face so they say
Hailsing of them rising to the day
You thought that we could do the same instream
Nothing, it just comes and takes your plans

I still hear you call
And you turn around in vain
I still hear you call
And you thought I heard my name
I still hear you call
But it?s me I end up facing
I still hear you call
As you ever walk away

I need you
I need you
I need you
I need you
