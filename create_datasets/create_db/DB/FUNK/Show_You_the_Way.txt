Let me show you, show you the way
On the edge of darkn there's a brightest light
A burning one, on the edge of dark
Where no one can tell their worlds apart
We'll live with dark, just take the ride

It's your boy, Thundercat

Heavy-hearted, a lover ends life
I just wanna live, learn how to fight
When it's all over, breathe into the light
Sink or swim, I'm not scared to die

Tell 'em how you feel, Kenny
Kenny Loggins

Your heart is struggling, baby
Trying to believe that there might be something you just couldn't see
But what if I told you that it's all so easy

Let me show you, show you the way
On the edge of darkness there's a brightest light
A burning one, on the edge of darkness
Where no one can tell their worlds apart
We'll live with dark, just take the ride

Ladies and gentleman, Michael McDonald

Wake up and dream
Tell the wall before you believe there might not be a truth
As long love lies waiting
Just hold your face into the light
Though right now you might not know why
As long as love lies waiting
There ain't no other way, baby

Let me show you, show you the way
On the edge of darkness there's a brightest light
A burning one, on the edge of dark
Where no one can tell their worlds apart
We'll live with dark, just take the ride
