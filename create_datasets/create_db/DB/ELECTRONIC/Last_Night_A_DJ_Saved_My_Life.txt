Last night a DJ saved my life 
Last night a DJ saved my life 
Yeah 

'Cause I was sittin' there bored to death 
And in just one breath he said 
You gotta get up 
You gotta get off 
You gotta get down girl 

You know you drive me crazy baby 
You've got me turning to another man 
Called you on the phone 
No one's home 
Baby why'd you leave me all alone? 
And if it wasn't for the music I don't know what I'd do 

Last night a DJ saved my life 
Last night a DJ saved my life from a broken heart 
Last night a DJ saved my life 
Last night a DJ saved my life with a song 

Last night a DJ saved my life 
Last night a DJ saved my life from a broken heart 
Last night a DJ saved my life 
Last night a DJ saved my life with a song 

You know I hopped into my car 
Didn't get very far, I know 
'Cause I had you on my mind 
Why be so unkind? 

You've got your women all around 
All around this town 
But I was trapped in love with you 
And I didn't know what to do 

But when I turned on my radio 
Found out all I needed to know 
Check it out 

Hey listen up to your local DJ 
You better hear what he's got to say 

There's not a problem that I can't fix 
'Cause I can do it in the mix 
And if your man gives you trouble, just move out on a double 
And you don't let it trouble your brain 
'Cause away goes trouble down the drain 
I said away goes trouble down the drain 

Last night a DJ saved my life 
Last night a DJ saved my life from a broken heart 
Last night a DJ saved my life 
Last night a DJ saved my life with a song 

Last night a DJ saved my life 
Last night a DJ saved my life from a broken heart 
Last night a DJ saved my life 
Last night a DJ saved my life with a song
