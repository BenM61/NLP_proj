You may find a better way
You may find the reason for it all
Say you walked on holy ground
Say you heard the sweetest sound of all
But you find that you never really cared
You find out that you have no love to share at all

So you challenge everyone you meet
Crying out to fill a void in you
What are you running from my love
What's this thing you're guilty of
Follow me and never feel accused

But you never do believe a word I say
And you never did believe there'd be day of reckoning

So you run and you run and you run
And you never stop
And you work and you work
Until you drop
You're in over your head and the pressure just don't quit
But you can't escape the reach of love

Faces haunt you in your dreams
Struggles of the broken heart I fear
Waking from a fitful sleep
Dutifully appointments keep
Try to hold this image of respect
So someone tells you when and where to go
But all the time you never really show your feelings

So you run and you run and you run

And you never stop
And you work and you work
And you work until you drop
You're in over your head and the pressure just don't quit
But you can't escape the reach of love

The reach of love
Ooh of love

You may find a better way
You might find the reason for it all
You may hold a better hand
All your pride and understanding
Never really feeling love at all
But what you thought were distant worlds apart
Pulls you in and wraps around your heart forever
