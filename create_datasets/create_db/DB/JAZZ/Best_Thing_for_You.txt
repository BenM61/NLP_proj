I only want what's the best thing for you
And the best thing for you would be me
I've been convinced

After thinking it through that the best thing for you would be me

Everyday to myself I'd say point the way
What would it be?
I ask myself what's the best thing you
And myself and I seem to agree
That the best thing for you would be me
