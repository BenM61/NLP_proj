It was a day like today
A Sunday afternoon
When they took you away
Down to Hades in a shopping trolley
With a magazine and a suitcase

They stole your clothes
I took your watch
I couldn't look you in the eyes
Why is it always those you love the most
You criticise?
Say oh no stranger
You're just like me
These things happen
We were children
In the mid-90s

Say oh no stranger
You're just like me
We get older
They get younger
It was you or me

We stood there
Throwing ice cream in your hair
Oh I solemnly swear
It's the thing I life I regret the most
Leaving you standing there
And if you asked me
I'd pull my eyes out
And when I woke up blind
If you forgave me I would sleep at night
Knowing I've led a good life

Say oh no stranger
You're just like me
These things happen
We were children
In the mid-90s

Say oh no stranger
You're just like me
We get older
They get younger
It was you or me

Learning how to keep living

Oh no stranger
You're just like me
These things happen
We were children
In the mid-90s

Say oh no stranger
You're just like me
We get older
They get younger
It was you or me
