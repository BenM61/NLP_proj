Work all day come back home
Get a little older
I don't feel like I belong
Tell me when it's over

This comfort I, wait for you
This comfort I

Try and break my routine
It's harder than it looks like
Drowning in monotony
Thinkin' that I'm alright

This comfort I wait for you
This comfort I

Can I embrace a moment with you
Cam I embrace a moment with you
No I missed my chance a thousand times before
I'll tell you why I'm gonna miss no more

Told me once told me twice
There will be a reward
Listened to your advice
Not a lot to record

This comfort I, wait for you
This comfort I

Can I embrace a moment with you
Can I embrace a moment with you
No I, don't need a lifetime a moment will do
Can I embrace a moment with you
I missed my chance a thousand times before
I swear that I, I'm gonna miss no more

Yes I missed my chance a thousand times before
I'll tell you why I'm gonna miss no more

Get it out, get it out of my way
Get it out, get it out of my way

Can I embrace a moment with you
Can I embrace a moment with you
No I don't need a lifetime a moment with you
Can I embrace a moment with you
For I missed my chance a thousand times before
I swear that I, I'm gonna miss no more

Yes I missed my chance a thousand times before
And I'll tell you why I'm gonna miss no more

No more

I missed my chance a thousand times before
I tell you why
I'm gonna miss no more
