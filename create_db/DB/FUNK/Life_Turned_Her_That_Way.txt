If she seems cold and bitter, I beg you
Just stop and consider what my baby's goin' through
Don't be quick to condemn her for things she said
Just remember, life turned her that way

You've been stepped on and walked on so, so many times
Whoa I hate to admit it, but the last footprint was mine
She was crying when I first met her and she cries more each day
Please, don't blame her, life turned her that way, oh yeah now
Life turned her that way, just want you to know, just want you to know now
I'm sorry about, oh, yes I am, please forgive me
So sorry about it, didn't mean to hurt you baby
I'm sorry about it, woo yeah, please forgive me, oh yeah, oh yeah
You know I'm sorry about it, didn't mean to hurt you, please forgive me baby
