Party's going on tonight
And I'm available
'Cause I look the part
I know I'm gonna steal a heart or two
Dressed in the latest style
The girls will say exactly what I want 'em to

Music's playin' far too load
The lights are far too bright
It's so crowded that I need a drink to put me right
The girls all start to stare
With their dresses far too tight
And their peroxide hair

I wish I'd stayed at home and watched a TV show
Or played some rock and roll
They're starting to surround me and are moving in
Lights are growin' dim girls are movin' in tonight

You know the girls are out to get ya
You try but they won't let ya
They really do upset ya
The girls are out to

Feeling in a kind of daze
The room's a smoky haze
When I saw the girl I danced with
I was quite amazed
The whole thing's quite obscene

Her face is white
With one eye blue the other green
I wish I'd stayed at home and watched a TV show
Or played some rock and roll
They're starting to surround me and are moving in
Baby life ain't what it seems it's full of cosmic dreams

You know the girls are out to get ya
You try but they won't let ya
They really do upset ya
The girls are out to

I wish I'd stayed at home and watched a TV show
Or played some rock and roll
They're starting to surround me and are moving in
Girls will give it all we can and you'll emerge a man
You know the girls are out to get ya
You try but they won't let ya
They really do upset you
