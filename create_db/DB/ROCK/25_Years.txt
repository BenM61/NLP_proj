Well I can't get to sleep at night
I always have the same old dream
That I did something wrong 
A long long time ago when I was just 15

Well the church bells are ring out of tune
It seems to last all time
And I dreamt that I had killed a man
A shiver tingled my spine

Everybody said
You walk with the devil down a wicked way
You get 25 years and you'll never see the day
When you come home and everybody's the same
Cause they too will wait 
For a long time, long time

And now I'm getting scared as all the dream they seem to come out real
How could I good I would I 
Ah no no no

And thinking to myself
I see my innocence is mowing down
And in a cry for mercy
I ask the saints to come and get me out

Everybody said
You walk with the devil down a wicked way
You get 25 years and you'll never see the day
When you come home and everybody's the same
Cause they too will wait 
For a long time, long time

And now I assume and hope to hell
That all I hear is all in my mind
There's people knocking on my door And calling me the murdering kind

The tears are running down my face 
There's nowhere here that I can hide
Kicking down the doors and screaming out my name the come inside

Everybody said
You walk with the devil down a wicked way
You get 25 years and you'll never see the day
When you come home and everybody's the same
Cause they to will wait 
For a long time, long time

I can feel the sleep leaving the day light shining in my eyes
Why am I in a prison cell waiting execution time
But the bars are nonexistent on the window frame above my bed
And looking at your face I realize its all in my head

Everybody said
You walk with the devil down a wicked way
You get 25 years and you'll never see the day
When you come home and everybody's the same
Cause they too will wait 
For a long time, long time

You walk with the devil down a wicked way
You get 25 years and you'll never see the day
When you come home and everybody's the same
Cause they too will wait 
For a long time, long time

You walk with the devil down a wicked way
You get 25 years and you'll never see the day
When you come home and everybody's the same
Cause they too will wait 
For a long time, long time
