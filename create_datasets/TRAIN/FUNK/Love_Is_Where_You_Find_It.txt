What's this magic that I feel inside?
So exciting when I'm close to you
When I'm touching you I can feel it come alive
Hypnotized by what's inside of you

Oh, we're just strangers
We know each other
I'm so glad
We found each other

Love is where you'll find it, put your heart inside it
There is no rhyme or reason, it just comes and makes you weak
And girl, we must believe it, in our hearts we?ll feel it
Love is where you'll find it

what's this mystery I've been captured in?
I can feel the glow of love touching on my skin
When I'm close to you there's a feeling from deep within
Only happens when I'm lying here with you

Oh, we're just strangers
Till we know each other
And I'm so glad
Look what we've discovered

Love is where you'll find it, hey, put your heart inside it
There is no rhyme or reason, it just comes and makes you weak
And girl, we must believe in, what our hearts are feeling
Love is where you'll find it, anywhere

Anywhere

Love is where you'll find it, ooh, put your heart inside it
There is no rhyme or reason, it just comes and makes you weak
And girl, we must believe it, in our hearts we?ll feel it
Love is where you'll find it

what's this mystery I've been captured in?
I can feel the glow of love touching on my skin
When I'm close to you there's a special light within
It only happens when I'm lying here with you

Oh, we're just strangers anticipating one another
I'm so glad, look what we've discovered

Love is where you'll find it, hey, put your heart inside it
There is no rhyme or reason, it just comes and makes you weak
And girl, we must believe what our hearts can feel
Love is where you'll find it, anywhere

Love is where you're gonna find it, put your heart deep inside it
There is no rhyme or reason, it just comes and makes you weak
And girl, we must believe in, what our hearts are feeling
Love is where you'll find it, anywhere
