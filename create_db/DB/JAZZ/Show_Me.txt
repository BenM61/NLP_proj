Won't you tell me 
If we're heading for a fall
Are we still confused at all
Won't you tell me

Tonight 
If we can move a little closer
If we can get a little deeper
We'll be complete

You got to show me
Assure me 
Nothing will go wrong
You got to show me 

Why you're holding on
You've got to show me
Assure me
Nothing will go wrong

You've got to show me 
Why you're holding on

Maybe 
You think it's not enough
Can't you see I'm trying hard 
To be open

Tonight 
If we get a little closer
If we get a little deeper
We'll be complete

You got to show me
Assure me 
Nothing will go wrong
You got to show me 
Why you're holding on

You got to show me
You got to show me
You got to show me
You got to show

You got to show me
Assure me 
Nothing will go wrong
You got to show me 
Why you're holding on
