If you see me walking down the streets
And I start to cry
Each time we meet

Walk on by
Ah, walk on by
And make believe
That I can't see the tears
Now let me grieve, ah in private
'Cause each time I see you
I just want to cry
Walk on by
Walk on by
Walk on by

I just can't get over loosing you
And so if I seem so broken in pieces

Walk on by
Aah, walk on by
And foolish pride
If I can't see the tears
Then let me hide all the tears and the sadness
You gave me when you said goodbye
Walk on by
Walk on by
Walk on by, just go for a stroll in the trees

Walk on by
Ah, walk on by
And make believe
That I can't see the tears
Now let me grieve, ah, in private
'Cause each time I see you
I just want to cry
Walk on by
Walk on by

You really gotta go, you really gotta go
Oh, you really gotta go, you really gotta go
You really gotta go, you really gotta go
Oh, you really gotta go
