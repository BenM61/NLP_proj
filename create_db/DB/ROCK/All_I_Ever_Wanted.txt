I can only say these things to you while you're sleeping
I hear the hum from the wires the sounds of the morning creepin'
So I lie awake and pretend you can hear me

Tell that you're scared of turning into your mother
I feel myself turn into my father
We could lie to each other like they do and say we're so happy
It's easy when you're young and you still want it so badly

And I feel my heart pounding 
And I think I might scream

I can tell you that you're all I ever wanted, dear
And I can utter every word that you ever hoped to hear
I shudder when I think that I might not be here forever, forever, forever

Tonight you whisper like a ghost and you look so shaken
You're so quiet and small and you tell me you want to be taken
I just never think of you as the kind of girl that would say that
You suddenly seem like some faceless thing in my grasp

You eyes so wide, your face aglow
It's the face of someone I don't know

I can tell you that you're all I ever wanted, dear
And I can utter every word that you've ever hoped to hear
I shudder when I think that I might not be here forever, forever, forever

All I can think is that it must be a kind of rebellion
To arm your fears like soldiers and slay them

I can tell you that you're all I've ever wanted, dear
Thorough the din of your breathing while you're sleeping here
You wake and you ask me
If I'm going to be here forever, forever, forever

Your face so expressive
And your eyes a lie
I wanna to tell you I can change them
When you cry at night 
But I'd be lying
Love is defying
