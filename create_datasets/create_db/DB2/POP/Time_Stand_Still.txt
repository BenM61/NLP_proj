If I had a way to make time stand still
I'd had a lot more time to kill
Sit on the beach and drink my fill
If I had a way to make time stand still

For a day, for an hour, for a year
For a while, for as long we're here
Stop the world, watch the days disappear
If I had a way to make time stand still

If I had a little more time with you
I'd be the man you'd want me to
Do all the things that I should to
If I had a little more time with you

For a day, for an hour, for a year
For a while, for as long we're here

Stop the world, watch the days disappear
If I had a little more time with you

If I had a way to make time turn back
I'd find a way to get you back
One of these days I know I will
When I find a way to make time stand still

For a day, for an hour, for a year
For a while, for as long we're here
Stop the world, watch the days disappear
If I had a way to make time stand still
If I had a way to make time stand still

Just a little time, just a little
Just a little time, just a little
