Sometimes I feel I've been here forever 
Sometime ago 
Sometimes we sense the doubt together 
Sometimes alone 

I'm tired but we won't sleep at all 
Even though the air is calm 
There's something here it's something warm 
Something cuts and scars inside tonight 

Sons of pioneers are hungry men 

Every voice I hear sounds so familiar 
Every song I know 
Still there's been no change in the weather 
But sometime we'll have to go 

I'm tired but we won't sleep at all 
Even though the air is calm 
There's something here it's something warm 
Something cuts and scars inside tonight 

Sons of pioneers are hungry men
