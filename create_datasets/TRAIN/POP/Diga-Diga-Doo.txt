Oh, Zulu man is feeling blue
Hear his heart beat a little tattoo
Diga Diga Doo, Diga Doo Doo
Diga Diga Doo, Diga Doo

You love me and I love you
And when you love it is natural to
Diga Diga Doo, Diga Doo Doo
Diga Diga Doo, Diga Doo

I'm so very Diga Diga Doo by nature
If you don't say Diga Diga to your mate
You're gonna lose your Poppa

So, let those funny people smile
How can there be a Virgin Isle with
Diga Diga Doo, Diga Doo Doo
Diga Diga Doo, Diga Doo.

(Scat Singing)
Diga Diga Doo, Diga Doo Doo
(More scat)
Diga Diga Doo, Diga Doo Doo
(More scat)
Diga Diga Doo, Diga Doo Doo
