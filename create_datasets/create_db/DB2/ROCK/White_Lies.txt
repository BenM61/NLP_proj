I don't know where you are or what you wanna do
It seems so these days I'm losing out on you
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, yeah

You come home so late I don't know where you've been
I wanna hold you tight but you make me wanna scream
Yeah, yeah

Oh, so now we're fighting in the streets
I can't breathe
'Cause I don't believe what you're saying

No, your white lies don't protect me
Be honest with me
It's all we can be to sustain

I drove around all morning
Thinking of starting again
Turning my back on a good thing
I turned the car 'round instead

No, your white lies don't protect me
Be honest with me
It's all we can be to sustain

Oh, so no more fighting in the streets
'Cause I can't breathe
'Cause I don't believe what you're saying

No, your white lies don't protect me
Be honest with me
It's all we can be to sustain

Oh, so no more fighting in the streets
'Cause I can't breathe
If I don't see you again

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
