This time I'm not going to walk away.
This time I'm not going to let you slide. I have to give you what your
Thirst is for. It's not for your good, it's not for my pride.
Evil lies beyond ignorance. Aware of the truth, aware of the facts.
The strength to take the stand to stop the slaughter is what you lack.
The weakness that you can't control brings
Animals death and pain. The struggle I fought to overcome
Is the dark pit where you choose to remain. This time I'm not going
To walk away. This time I'm not going to let you slide.
I have to give you what your thirst is for. It's not for your good,
It's not for my pride. Keep on with your killing,
Your threats and your jokes, just brace yourself for what's in store.
Continue to flow with the close minded evil, prepare for all out war.
A dose of the hate your kind fills me with everyday.
Your entitled to your own freedom, not to take others away. All out war!
