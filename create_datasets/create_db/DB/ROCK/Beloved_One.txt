We have both been here before 
Knockin' upon love's door 
Begging for someone to let us in
Knowing this we can agree to keep each other company 
Never to go down that road again 

My beloved one, my beloved one 

Your eyes shine through me 
You are so divine to me 
Your heart has a home in mine 
We won't have to say a word 
With a touch all shall be heard 
When I search my heart it's you I find 

My beloved one, my beloved one, my beloved one 

You were meant for me, I believe you were sent to me from a dream straight into 
To my arms
Hold your body close to me 
You mean the most to me 
We will keep each other safe from harm 

My beloved one, my beloved one, my beloved one
