Doncamatic

Down lowly
Make up for the time you've wasted
Come slowly
And claim back the boy you left behind

Close the white book
Unplug the brain from the game
'Cause it's time to wipe out
To the stars
Get on the fame

The song is not the same when we're
All played out, played out, all played out
They said the memories
All fade out, fade out, all fade out
Tell me did you feel that?

Don't slow down
Even if it's only to escape
Just down, low down
Before somebody steals your place man

Close the white book
Unplug the brain from the game
'Cause it's time to wipe out
To the stars
Get on the fame
And the conversation's over

We're all played out, played out, all played out
(talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me)
You see the memories
All fade out, fade out, all fade out
(talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me)
Tell me did you feel that?

Doncamatic

Down lowly
Make up for the time you wasted
Come slowly
Claim back the boy you left behind and
Close the white book
Unplug the brain from the game
It's time to wipe out to the bar get on the fame

The song is not the same when we're
All played out, played out, all played out
(Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me)
You see the memories
All fade out, fade out, all fade out
(Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me)

The song is not the same when we're
All played out, played out, all auto tuned
(Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me)

The song is not the same when we're
All played out, played out, played out, played out
(Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me)
Tell me did you feel that?
