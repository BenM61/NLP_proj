Natty Natty Movement 
There's motorway grooving 
Natty Natty Movement 
Some many miles to be done 
Well we're gonna take this movement onto the streets 
A one day to get the shit down heavy 

People power in the Disco Hour 
People power in the Disco Hour
People power in the Disco Hour 
There's gonna be a people power
In that disco Hour 

You see, disco is a halfway
To a full discontent 
Disco is the halfway 
To a full discontent 
Well we're gonna get this disco heat onto the streets 

People power in the Disco Hour
People power in the Disco Hour
People power in the Disco Hour 
There's gonna be a people power
Come that disco Hour 

There we're times of if we stick with them, they'll stick by us 
Pretty soon to realize they were only out for themselves 
We're going for the dressing down of the laws that make us drag our feet 
Dancing to fiction goers 
Is that really all we need? 

People power in the Disco Hour 
People power in the Disco Hour 
People power in the Disco Hour 
There's gonna be a people power 
In the disco hour

Lean on the horn 
There is double parking on the dance floor 

People power in the Disco Hour 
People power in the Disco Hour
People power in the Disco Hour 
There's gonna be a people power
In the disco hour
