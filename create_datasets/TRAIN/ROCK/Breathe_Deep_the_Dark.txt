I'm Obscure, the shadow black
Alone I walk on the shunned path
Centuries mine, reveal the past
The unknown yawning black

Treading the lone path others fear to explore
Open gates to realm of eternal night
Material world, nothing to me now
I am one with the darkness
Seek not the light

Alien core, light is not for me
Free in the dark with the coffin worm
Survived alone in the world's dusk
Your gods are dead, earth buried them

Riding the night wind
Soar above the tombs
Of sorcerers departed and towers burned
Doom has taken shape and sealed Earth's fate
Still I live strange years
Stand beneath the stars

Free to ride the solar winds
Above the dying land
Taking my solace in dimensions far
This pale, blank aeon

Recall years when the worlds sailed
Darkling tides in crimson skies
In galleries ever I search
For haunted crypts where no lamp burns

Lurking in the cavern deep within the mind
Crowning the throne of dreams with the blackened gems
Dwelling in the towers both ruined and vast
I am he who returns when the scythe shall fall

Free to ride the solar winds
Above the dying land
Taking my solace in dimensions far
This pale, blank aeon

Once I sough the shape of the world around me
Once I dreamed I'd walk the common path
Once I let the weakened minds disguise me
Once I thought I lost my outer shell

Dark world is rising
The sky is black
The light of day's not coming back

I'm the night, my visions dark
Alone I tread the ancient track
Centuries mine, learned from the past
The unknown yawning black

Treading the lone path others fear to explore
Open gates to realm of eternal night
Finding the release in the cosmic scheme
Welcome the exile from those they called men

Free to ride the solar winds
Above the dying land
Taking my solace in dimensions far
Breathe deep the dark!
