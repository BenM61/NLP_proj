When my feet were in shackles
And my hands were in chains
You took my mind and made it settle
In a land so far away

When I was toiling in the fields (yeah)
You made me push on through
Yes I'm head over heels,
Over heels in love with you
Yes I'm head over heels,
Over heels in love with you

When I was in the womb
You made me wanna see this world
Every setting of the moon
I dreamt of you being my girl

Say ooh I can't deny
Without you I would be dead
And the day that I die
I die with you in my head,
Yes the day that I die
I die with you in my head,
In my head in my head

There's just no get away
When you're dancing in my brain
When I'm cruising on your waves
Coulda never go astray (ooh)

Everything is music
I just put parts in a frame
To capture this very moment
And never let it go away
They use you and abuse you
And treat you like a thing
Forever I'll be faithful
Have your back until the end
Forever I'll be faithful
Have your back until the end

There's just no get away
When you're dancing in my brain
When I'm cruising on your waves
Coulda never go astray (ooh)

Me say wetin in deh talk deh talk talk talk
Gunshot it ah bark like dog ina di dark
As Babatunde enter the dance di dancehall
Babatunde
Me say wetin in deh talk deh talk talk talk
Gunshot it ah bark like dog ina di dark
As Babatunde enter the dance di dancehall
Babatunde

There's just no get away
When you're dancing in my brain
When I'm cruising on your waves
Coulda never go astray (ooh)
