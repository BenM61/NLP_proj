Why must I meet you in a secret rendezvous?
Why must we steal away to steal a kiss or two?
Why must we wait to do the things we want to do?
Why, oh, why, oh, why, oh, why, oh why?

Wish we didn't have to meet secretly
Wish we didn't have to kiss secretly
Wish we didn't have to be afraid
To show the world that we're in love

Till we have the right to meet openly
Till we have the right to kiss openly
We'll just have to be content to be in love secretly

Why, oh, why, oh, why, oh, why, oh why?

Wish we didn't have to meet secretly
Wish we didn't have to kiss secretly
Wish we didn't have to be afraid
To show the world that we're in love

Till we have the right to meet openly
Till we have the right to kiss openly
We'll just have to be content to be in love secretly

Why must we wait until we're dancing cheek to cheek?
To whisper all the words of love we long to speak?
Why must our love be like a game of hide-and-seek?
