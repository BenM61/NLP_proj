Well, I know that things won't be the same
And I know that you're the one to blame
When you broke my heart and made me cry
I am gonna bid my weary blues goodbye

Weary blues have made me cry
Well, these weary blues I'm gonna bid goodbye
I know, I won't forget you but I'll try
You know I am gonna bid my weary blues goodbye

Well, I know that things won't be the same
And I know that you're the one to blame
When you broke my heart and made me cry
I am gonna bid my weary blues goodbye

Weary blues have made me cry
Well, these weary blues I am gonna bid goodbye
I know, I won't forget you but I'll try
I am gonna bid my weary blues goodbye
I am gonna bid my weary blues goodbye
