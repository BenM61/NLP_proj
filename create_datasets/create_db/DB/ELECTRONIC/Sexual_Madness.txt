Oh uh oh uh oh, it's sexual madness
Oh uh oh uh oh, it makes me helpless
Oh uh oh uh oh, I feel it, baby
Oh uh oh uh oh, I need it, baby blue

When I touch your body in the city of dreams
The lights go down on the silver screens
The black man says, everything's so clear
The trouble of tomorrow are so far from here

Anyway, anyhow baby, where have you been?
I miss you, wanna kiss you, do you know what I mean?
Anyway, anywhere I'm guilty of love
So take your chances, baby

Oh uh oh uh oh, it's sexual madness
Oh uh oh uh oh, it makes me helpless
Oh uh oh uh oh, I feel it, baby
Oh uh oh uh oh, I need it, baby blue
I miss you

On the dance, confuse like making love
Enough is good but it's not enough
We're dancing on in the shadows of hell
It gets real hot when you ring my bell

Is it good, is it bad, I don't know what it is
The only thing I know is I long for your kiss
Light a fire in my heart, light a fire in my soul
Take your chances, baby

Oh uh oh uh oh, it's sexual madness
Oh uh oh uh oh, it makes me helpless
Oh uh oh uh oh, I feel it, baby
Oh uh oh uh oh, I need it, baby blue
I miss you

Oh uh oh uh oh, it's sexual madness
Oh uh oh uh oh, it makes me helpless
Oh uh oh uh oh, I feel it, baby
Oh uh oh uh oh, I need it, baby blue
I love you, I miss you

I touch you, I want you
