[Chorus]
I can feel it in my bones 
Love is just around the corner 
You don't have to be alone 
Only if you really want to 

And I'm gonna say that one more time 
This evenin' 

[Chorus] 

Listen now 

I can feel it, can't you feel it, come on 
I can feel it way down in my bones 

[Chorus: x2] 

Wake up one mornin' 
Find a brand new day 
Good love vibrations 
Everything's goin' in your way 

One day you'll see 
A sky of blue, yeah yeah 
I know the sun gonna shine on you 
Yeah yeah 

Listen to me 
Love is around the corner 
Love is around the corner 
Love is around the corner, yeah 

[Repeat: x3]
I can feel it, can't you feel it, come on 
I can feel it way down in my bones
