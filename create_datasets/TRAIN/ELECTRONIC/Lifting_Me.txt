Lifting me, don't know how
You do it but it's lifting me
Another day, another way
He finds a point to pressure me

A silly girl with silly ways
I hear this, I'm pitiful
I'll be that girl, can you give me
The strength to be free?

Lifting me, don't know how
You do it but it's lifting me
Keep lifting me, I don't know how
You do it but it's lifting me, yeah

Another night, another fight
He finds a point to criticize
A frilly dress and frilly ways
I hear this, so pitiful

I'll be that girl, can you give me
The strength to be free?
Lifting me, don't know how
You do it but it's lifting me

Keep lifting me, I don't know how
You do it but it's lifting me, yeah
Lifting me, don't know how
You do it but it's lifting me

Keep lifting me, I don't know how
You do it but it's lifting me yeah
I'll be that girl, can you give me
The strength to be free?

Lifting me, don't know how
You do it but it's lifting me
Keep lifting me, I don't know how
You do it but it's lifting me

You're lifting me, don't know how
You do it but it's lifting me
Keep lifting me, I don't know how
You do it but it's lifting me
