Behind the smile she holds back the tears of an aching heart
For the way she loves you now is the way she loved me once.
But for the children we'd go our sep'rate ways
But for the children she'd stop pretending that she cares.
Man to man iet's sit right down and talk about it
Man to man let's work it out before it gets too late
She's confused she don't know which one to choose
For the children's sake she don't know which one to lose.
Though it hurts to know that she wants someone else
I can't stop this feeling of love I have inside for her
If you really love her the way that she's in love with you
If you really love her as much as I do.
Sometimes I look into her eyes and I wanna die
Although she's close to me she's so far away
Somewhere else with you.
If you really love her the way that she's in love with you
If you really love her as much as I do.
Man to man let's sit right down and talk about it . . .
It's hard to know what went wrong
Why this love that he had has gone
But if you're just having fun leave her aione
For the children's sake don't break up a home.
Man to man let's sit right down and talk about it
Man to man let's work it out before it gets too late.
For the children for the children let's work it out
Before it get too late.
