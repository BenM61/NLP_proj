Summer moved on
And the way it goes, you can't tag along
Honey moved out
And the way it went Leaves no doubt

Moments will pass
In the morning light I found out
Seasons can't last
And there's just one thing left to ask

Stay, don't just walk away
And leave me another day
A day just like today
With nobody else around

Friendships move on
Until the day you can't get along
Handshakes unfold
And the way it goes, no one knows

Moments will pass
In the morning light I found out
Reasons can't last
So there's just one thing left to ask

Stay, don't just walk away
And leave me another day
A day just like today
Stay, don't just walk away
With nobody else around

Reasons can't last
And there's just one thing 
Left to ask

Stay, don't just walk away
And leave me another day
A day just like today
Stay, don't just walk away
With nobody else around

Summer moved on
