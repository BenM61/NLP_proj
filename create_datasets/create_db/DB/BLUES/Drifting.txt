Just 'cause I'm broke
Don't mean I'm useless
I'm choking smoke
A sea of letters fall out

One by one married
But I am changing for the better
But one by one they'll start to leave
'Cause it's a pity I'm still cold and I'm on the run

Drifting
A lover for the taking
Another heart for the breaking
Drifting
I'm a lover for the taking
I'm another heart for the breaking

Just 'cause I'm late
Don't mean I'm losing
I've laid awake
To keep from bruising

One by one married
But I am putting out for sale
Love's package with a seal
For any mother with a dying hope ?

Drifting
A lover for the taking
Another heart for the breaking
Drifting
I'm a lover for the taking
I'm another heart for the breaking

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
