Girl, I've had some good,
I've had some bad in my days.
I never knew someone like you would come my way.
To tell the truth, I can't help but be a little afraid
I think your love might be a little too much for me.

Now we can get sexual
Girl, I want to' be down everyday and night (sugar)
Now we can get sexual
Just as long as you know my sexual capacity
Now we can get sexual
I'm die-n'- I'm tryin- I want to' (I'm die-n'- I'm tryin'-ooh...)
I'm afraid that your lovin might just be a little too much for me.
(Afraid, might be, too much)

...girl
I've paid the dues, I've made the rules all before
I've seen them beg, I made them plead for more
But I've never seen nothing better babe,
I am a little afraid I think your love might be-a little too much for me.
yeah! and I say...

Now we can get sexual
Girl, I want to' be down everyday and night (sugar)
