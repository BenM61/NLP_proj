Believe it, I need you by my side
Yes, I know you know, know you know, know I've been a sinner, baby
I've seen it, I've seen you high and dry
Yes, I know you don't, know you don't, know you don't need me to say it
But if anything happens between us
Does everything change?
I know you feel it too, I can see it in your face
So tell me now not to get too close
'Cause it always happens

One, two, three, four
How much longer can this go
Oh, babe? Don't break
Every single breath you take
Kills me softly, chills my body
But, when we reach the limit
We're really giving 'cause

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
I wanna cherish you
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
I wanna cherish you

It's so clear we're right on the edge
Both in, we're over our heads
But I'm ready to take this fall
You say, "Baby, I want it all"
I want it all

One, two, three, four
How much longer can this go
Oh, babe? Don't break
Every single breath you take
Kills me, softly, chills my body
But when we reach the limit
We're really giving 'cause

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
I wanna cherish you
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
I wanna cherish you

And now we finally reach the limit, babe
But you know you can trust, don't be afraid
'Cause all you need is just a little faith
A little faith

One, two, three, four
How much longer can this go
Oh, babe? Don't break
Every single breath you take
Kills me softly, chills my body

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
I wanna cherish you
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
I wanna cherish you
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
I wanna cherish you
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
I wanna cherish you
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
I wanna cherish you
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
I wanna cherish you
