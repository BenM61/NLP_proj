Since I was very young I've realised
I never wanted to be human size
So I avoid the crowds and traffic jams
They just remind me of how small I am

Because of this longing in my heart
I'm going to start the growing art
I'm going to grow now and never stop
Think like a mountain, grow to the top

[Chorus]
Tall, tall, tall, I want to be tall, tall, tall
As big as a wall, wall, wall, as big as a wall, wall, wall
And if I'm not tall, tall, tall, then I will crawl, crawl, crawl
Because I'm not tall, tall, tall, tall, tall, tall, tall, tall
Tall, tall, tall, I want to be tall, tall, tall
As big as a wall, wall, wall, as big as a wall, wall, wall
And if I'm not tall, tall, tall, then I will crawl, crawl, crawl
Because I'm not tall, tall, tall, tall, tall, tall, tall, tall

With concentration
My size increased
And now I'm fourteen stories high
At least
Empire State Human
Just a born kid
I'll go to Egypt to be
The pyramids

[Chorus over refrain 1]
[Refrain 1]
Brick by brick
Stone by stone
Growing till he's fully grown
Brick by brick
Stone by stone
Growing till he's fully grown

[Refrain 2]
Fetch more water
Fetch more sand
Biggest person in the land
Fetch more water
Fetch more sand
Biggest person in the land

[Refrain 1]

[Chorus refrain 1 and 2]

[Refrain 2]
