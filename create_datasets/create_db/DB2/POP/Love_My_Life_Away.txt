Yeah I want to love my life away 
I wanna love my life away 
I wanna love, love, love 
Love my life away with you 

I want your hugging in the morning 
All your kissin' late at night 
I want your sweet talk in the sunshine 
And holding my hand in the moonlight 

Cause I wanna love my life away 
I wanna love my life away 
I wanna love, love, love 
Love my life away with you 

Yes we're gonna let the world and all of its troubles 
Go right on-a spinning by 
We're gonna build one dream upon another 
Clear up to the sky 

Cause I wanna love my life away 
I wanna love my life away 
I wanna love, love, love 
Love my life away with you 

I keep you warm in the winter 
Give you cool, cool kisses in the summertime 
Walk by your side in the autumn 
And in spring bells will chime 

Cause I wanna love my life away 
I wanna love my life away 
I wanna love, love, love 
Love my life away with you 

Yeah I want to love my life away 
I wanna love my life away 
I wanna love, love, love 
Love my life away with you
