Golden Void speaks to me
Denying my reality
Lose my body, lose my mind,
Flow like wind, flow like wine
Down a corridor of flame
Will I fly so high again
Is there something wrong with me
I cannot hear, I cannot see

Down a corridor of flame
Down a corridor of flame
Down a corridor of flame
Down a corridor of flame

So you think the time is past,
The life you lead will always last
Chaotic fusion's of your soul,
Down below that rocky knoll
Through the clouds an open sky,
The wind flows through your watering eyes
The sounds are pitched to draw you
On your never ending journey
On The edge of time,
The edge of time
The edge of time...
