Oh I'll bet I know what you like
At least think I know what you might
I'm not the most cocksure guy
But I get all bold with every smile

So please, show me your teeth, I'll show mine
I sure hope our P's and Q's don't mind
Cause I've been alone quite some time
And I've got to scratch this itch of mine
And I think I know what you know
I'm not that smooth but I'm not blind

The hours pass us by as gin slips slowly
Past our tingling spines, cheeks warm and glowing
I'm a social mess but not yet slurring
The words that come to rest upon my luring tongue

Oh I'll bet I know what you like
At least think I know what you might
I'm not the most cocksure guy
But I still sure fight the good hard fight
Try as I may, try I might
I'll ever scratch this itch of mine
We've all got our vices, this one's mine
So I might not smoke but I get high

Underneath this fleshy robe lies a beast with no control
I fed it once look how it's grown
Oh my god, bring me peace from this wolf covered in fleece
I can't shake loose from its teeth
Oh my god, set me free
I have no ability to cut my leash and walk away

With every passing night my conscience lessens
And seems to pacify these guilt filled sessions
Now I'm a social pest but not yet willing
To put my laws to rest till I'm done filling these holes

I'll bet I know what you like
At least think I know what you might
And I'm not the most cocksure man (?)
I take what I get and get what I can
