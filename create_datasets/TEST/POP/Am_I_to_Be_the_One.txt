Am I to be the one that your heart picks
Or do you keep me near you just for kicks
Well, I don't think it's fair in any way
I got to have an answer right away

Am I to be the one
Am I to be the one that wins your heart?

I'm feeling like a leaf hanging on a vine
And it's about to make me lose my mind
Now, if I am the one baby, you would choose
Then let me run around and spread the news

Am I to be the one
Am I to be the one that wins your heart?

You got me so upset, it's a hard to sleep
I'm sitting down at dinner but I still can't eat
Can hardly knot my tie or lace my shoes
Now, if I'm in a race, will I win or lose

Am I to be the one
Am I to be the one that wins your heart?

I'm pleading and I'm begging like a natural man
If you can't help me baby, no one can
I know how much I care and you do to
But I can't say a word till I hear from you

Am I to be the one
Am I to be the one that wins your heart?
Am I to be the one
Am I to be the one that wins your heart?
