Come all ye rolling minstrels
And together, we will try
To rouse the spirit of the earth
And move the rolling sky

Those that dance, will start to dance
And those who don't will stay
In time to (unverified) our merry tune
That we play for you today

So, come all ye rolling minstrels
And together we will try
To rouse the spirit of the earth
And move the rolling sky

Our fiddler, he just loves to play
And that's why he plays so good
And now he plays a violin
Made out of solid wood

So, come all ye rolling minstrels
And together we will try
To rouse the spirit of the earth
And move the rolling sky

Possessor of the magic touch
And no magician he
Will play for you some magic notes
Instead, as you will see

So, come all ye rolling minstrels
And together we will try
To rouse the spirit of the earth
And move the rolling sky

Sound of beating on the drum
Song behind you'll hear
And to the rhythm of guitar
We hope you'll lend an ear

So, come all ye rolling minstrels
And together we will try
To rouse the spirit of the earth
And move the rolling sky

Well, the man who plays the bass does make
Those low notes that you hear
And the high notes come from you and me
For we will sing so clear

So, come all ye rolling minstrels
And together we will try
To rouse the spirit of the earth
And move the rolling sky
