Thinking, 
Long ago when we were young and free
Love happened easily and dreams never died
Life sung a pretty song, 
Now those days are gone

Crying, 
Finding comfort in the friends we knew
Now it's just me and you trying alone
We used to get along (we used to)
Now those days are gone

Playing with words
When there's nothing much to say
Searching to find what we lost along the way
Could it be one day our feelings changed
I hope we see it through
'Cause I just can't stand the thought
Of life without you

Dreaming, 
Whispers echo on the summer wind
Back where the love begins, 
When nights were so warm
With stars we could wish upon, 
Now those days are gone

We had a chance but we lost it all somehow
Broken the spell and our dreams lie heavy now
Could it be some day our feelings changed
I hope we see it though
'Cause I just can't stand the thought
Of life without you

Thinking, 
Long ago when we were young and free
Love happened suddenly and we couldn't see
Where we were going wrong, 
Now those days are gone.
