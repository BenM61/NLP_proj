You've gotta pick yourself up by the bootstraps
No one's gonna help you out when you fall
You've gotta find a way out of your problems
When you're broke and you're backed up against the wall
If you sleep on your only chances
They'll never come around again
So dig deep and swing for the fences
You never know it might work out in the end

Come join the fight
So we can change the way we're living
What's left inside?
If you believe
Believe you'll never give in
Come join the fight
Turn away and you'll be sure to lose it
Hold onto those dreams
They're the one thing they can't take away now

I was young and I wouldn't hear it
You had opinions I had mine too
Just a kid with all the answers
A pompous pride and not one clue
It's getting late now shadow's falling
As the sun sets on my time
There's always something there to remind me
I try to keep up and still fall behind

Come join the fight
So we can change the way we're living
What's left inside?
If you believe
Believe you'll never give in
Come join the fight
Turn away and you'll be sure to lose it
Hold onto those dreams
They're the one thing they can't take away now

What's left inside?
If you believe
Believe you'll never give in

I was young and I wouldn't hear it
You had opinions I had mine too
Just a kid with all the answers
A pompous pride and not one clue

Come join the fight
So we can change the way we're living
What's left inside?
If you believe
Believe you'll never give in

Turn away and you'll be sure to lose it
Hold onto those dreams
They're the one thing they can't take away now

Come join the fight
