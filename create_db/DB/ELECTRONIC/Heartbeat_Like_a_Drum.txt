Like a drum like a drum 
Every time you walk on by I got a sight high
You make my heart beat 
Like a drum (heartbeat heartbeat heartbeat)
Every time you look my way I gotta say hey
You make my heart beat 
Like a drum (heartbeat heartbeat heartbeat)
You make me lie 
You make me cry 
I want to die
You make my heart beats like a drum
Then I'll have to tell you 
What you mean to me (I didn't did I)
Then I'll have to say 
Love will set you free (oh no)
Then I'll have to say 
Love will come your way

It really doesn't matter 
It really doesn't matter
It really doesn't matter what they say

In your eyes I see some paradise (see some paradise)
In your arms I see that paradise (see that paradise)
I want you 
I want you 
I want you to stay here
So don't run away
Don't run away
Every time you walk on by 
I got a sight high
You make my heart beat 
Like a drum (heartbeat heartbeat heartbeat)
You make me lie 
You make me cry 
I want to die
My heart beats like a drum 
(heartbeat)
Like a drum like drum like a drum like a drum (heartbeat heartbeat)
Ooh like a drum
Drum (drum)
Drum (drum)
Then I'll have to tell you 
What your kisses mean (I didn't did I)
Then I'll have to say 
Love will set you free (no no no)
Then I'll have to say 
Love will come your way (come your way)

It really doesn't matter 
It really doesn't matter
It really doesn't matter what they say (heartbeat heartbeat)
It really doesn't matter what they say
My heart beats like a drum (heartbeat heartbeat)
