Yeah
Lover I'm off the streets
Gonna go where the bright lights
And the big city meet
With a red guitar, on fire
Desire

She's the candle
Burning in my room
I'm like the needle
Needle and spoon
Over the counter
With a shotgun
Pretty soon, everybody got one
And the fever when I'm beside her
Desire
Desire

Desire
Desire

Burning
Burning

She's the dollars
She's my protection
Yeah, she's the promise
In the year of election
Ah, sister, I can't let you go
I'm like a preacher
Stealing hearts at a traveling show
For the love or money, money?
Desire
Desire
Desire
Desire
