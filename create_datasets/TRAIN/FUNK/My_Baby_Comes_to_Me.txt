Well, she go to see the baker when she wants a cake
She go to see the butcher when she wants a steak
She go to see the doctor when she's got a cold
She go to see the gypsy when she wants her fortune told

When she wants good loving my baby comes to me
When she wants good loving my baby comes to me

Well, she go to see Big Daddy when she wants to find me
She go to see the plumber when she wants to fix up her sink
She go down to the pawn shop when she wants to get some loot
She go to the beauty parlor when she wants to look real cute

When she wants good loving my baby comes to me
When she wants good loving my baby comes to me

Well, she go down to the river when she wants to take a dip
She buys a Cola-Cola when she wants to take a little sip
She go to see her father when she wants some new shoes
She go to see her mother when she down and got the blues

But when she wants good loving my baby she comes to me
When she wants good loving my baby comes to me
