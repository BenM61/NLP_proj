There's nothin' you can do girl
There's nothin' you can say
You're talkin' to the sky girl
I just got to get away
Got to hear the wind song
Singin' in my ear
Got to get it on girl
And I'll never make it here

'Cause the wind was my mother
The highway is my brother
I was born to wander
And it's time for movin' on
I was born to wander
Turn around and I'll be gone, gone, gone

I'm just followin' my heart girl
And it's followin' the sun
Lookin' for an answer
I know may never come
But I gotta chase my dreams girl
Like a river to the sea
Got to find a rainbow
That's waitin' there for me

'Cause the wind was my mother
The highway is my brother
I was born to wander
And it's time for movin' on
I was born to wander
Turn around and I'll be gone, gone, gone
