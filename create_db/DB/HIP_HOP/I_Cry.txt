[Chorus:]
When I cry, you cry 
We cry, together 
Said I cry, you cry 
We cry, together 
Said I cry, you cry 
We cry, together 
Said I cry, you cry 
We cry, together 

[Ja Rule] 
I life I love my wife 
A bad time to prevail, it overwhelmed me 
I'm livin in hell but livin wealthy 
And know these hoes love me 

Because I'm a star 
I can't even cop a drink at the bar 
Get me some bottles of that Remi Mar-tin 
Let's get the party 
Cracking right here f*ck V.I.P 

Now when my baby loves me 
Home wit tears in her eyes 
And when I get in, I hurt her more by tellin her lies 
She ain't surprise at me 

Just surprise at we 
Been together for this long 
And I can be 
The one to mistreat her 

Thought it last forever 
'Cause if I cry, you cry 
We cry together 

[Chorus] 

[Ja Rule] 
From, what I recall we was little niggas 
Cut, who gettin high, the hottest pictures 
Livin, life so free 
That we ain't fearin 

The, ills of the world 
In heat of drug dealin 
You and I then made a killin 
And tuck together 

I this land of forbidden treasure 
Love is the only evil seed that could sever 
A tied this close 
Not the love between us but your love for the dough 

You went O.T started makin M-O-N-E-Why 
All my good niggas gotta die 
But shit could last forever 
I wish (???) was pleasure 

'Cause when you die 
I cried, we cried together 

[Chorus] 

[Ja Rule] 
Wash away your tears (my love) 
You ain't gotta cry no more (my love) 
I'm putting on everything out (my love) 
And my pain it's my love 

And I want 
This world to smile for me 
Don't shed a tear 'cause the nigga died happily 
My momma warned me life was a muthafucka 

But I ignored the warning and kept on hustlin 
And every night she just looked at me 
Tears in her eyes and they be saying shit like 
"I don't want me baby to die" 

Brought so much pain into a life 
Gotta make it better 
'Cause when ma cried I cried 
We cried together 

[Chorus] 

[Lil' Mo] 
Oooooohhhh 
You cry, then I cry 
Then we cry 
When he cries 

I cry together, together 
When I cry, then you cry 
Then we'll cry, together 
Baby, 'cause when 

Ja cries, Mo cries 
We'll cry, together 
If he cry, I'll cry 
Then we'll cry, together
