Here she comes, that little town flirt
You're falling for her and you're gonna get hurt
Here she comes with that look in her eye
She plays around with every guy that goes by

Well, I know it's so hard to resist
The temptation of her tender red lips

But you can get hurt, hurt
Yeah, you can get a hurt
Fooling around with that little town flirt
Fooling around with that little town flirt

Here she comes, just a look at that style
She's looking at you, giving you that smile
But I know she's gonna treat you wrong
So your heart just a better be strong

'Cause you can get hurt, hurt
Yeah, you can get a hurt
Fooling around with that little town flirt

I know how you feel, you think her love is real
You think this time you've got a paper heart
When she starts to tear it apart
That's when she'll let you go

Here she comes, that little town flirt
You're falling for her and you're gonna get hurt
Yeah, I know it's so hard to resist
The temptation of her tender red lips

But you can get hurt, hurt
Yeah, you can get a hurt
Fooling around with that little town flirt
Fooling around with that little town flirt
Fooling around with that little town flirt
