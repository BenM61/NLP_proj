Walking down the street
Something caught my eye
A growing epidemic
That really ain't fly
This middle aged lady
I gotta be blunt
Her spandex biker shorts
Were creeping up the front
I could see her uterus
Her pants were too tight
She musn't own panties
There were none in sight
She walked right by
The poor woman didn't know
She had a frontal wedgie
A Cameltoe

Umm Hmm
That's right
Uh Huh
Oh No
Fix yourself girl
You got a Cameltoe

Girl that's gotta hurt
Take some time and adjust
Can't you see people staring
And making a fuss
Could not believe my eyes
Had to take a second glance
Is your crotch hungry girl?
Cause it's eating your pants
Do you enjoy the commotion
And attention it brings?
The only lips I want to see
Are the ones that sing
In public putting on
An X rated show
Grossing people out
With your Cameltoe

Umm Hmm
That's right
Uh Huh
Oh No
Fix yourself girl
You got a Cameltoe

First day of spring and by the looks of things
These girls done forgot how to dress
A little too quick to wearin pum pum shorts
And it's causing me much distress
Whoomp there it is ya'll right in the front
Everybody come and get a good look
I can see everything through the panty cling
Every crannie and every nook
You better take a quick minute before you step outside
Check the area that's pubic
Or you'll get your panties all up in a bunch
All twisted up like rubic
Take these words of advice cause its not very nice
I want to put you all in the know
Girls don't sleep don't let your pants creep
Watch out for the Cameltoe.

Umm Hmm
That's right
Uh Huh
Oh No
Fix yourself girl
You got a Cameltoe
