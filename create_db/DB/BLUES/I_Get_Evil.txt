Two kind of people I just can't stand
That's an evil-hearted woman and a lyin' man
Don't you lie to me
No don't you lie to me
Because it make me mad
I get evil as a man can be

You told me that you loved me a long time ago
The fellow that you got you don't want him no more
Don't you lie to me, ha ha
No don't you lie to me
Because it makes me mad girl
I get evil as a man can be
Whoo

You know you been thinking when you sat down on my knee
You were fooling that moonshine tryin' to jive poor me
Don't you lie to me
No babe don't you lie to me
Because it make me mad girl
I get evil as a man can be

Now don't you lie to me, yeah
Babe don't lie to me, no
Aw don't you lie to me, girl
I said don't lie to me, no
Because it make me mad
I get evil as a man can be
Whoo, come on, well all right
