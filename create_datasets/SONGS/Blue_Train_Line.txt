Here's another thing
That threw up in my mind like the razor blade and her wrist locked
In a closet of Deep Space Nine
Deposit for a wasted life
I lost it with a sweepstakes sigh in another fucking fight
A junkie in a queue for the lavatory line

That's another lost sight
A stabbing of his eyes
Her veins are now popping like Blue Train lines
Still pumping on the bathroom floor, and not for the frost or what the mirror thought it saw
He got a clearer thought and pulled her straight out
"You got me jumping from a real safe height
I wanna fall forever if you ain't by my side
I wanna fall forever if you ain't in my life"

I just been eating away when I found her
All drowned in grey
I might have drowned her
I caught her plate number
And yeah, I might have seen it all

In Hell, excel like never ending
Life before us, light leaving us down
Smoke settled in a fabric of the BFE 34
Dropping burning crumbs on the seedy floor
In the back of a CD store
For the radio rat and a seedy door
Then she threw her money, yeah
And she still needs more
Then die of blood!

Six pounds in my pocket
I threw another man's change
Lose another man's six
I guess he might have seen it all

I just been eating away when I found her
All drowned in grey
I might have drowned her
I caught her plate number
And yeah, I might have seen it all

Six pounds in my pocket
I threw another man's change
Lose another man's six
I guess he might have seen it all

I just been eating away when I found her
All drowned in grey
I might have drowned her
I caught her plate number
And yeah, I might have seen it all
