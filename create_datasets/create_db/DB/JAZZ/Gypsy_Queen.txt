Nowhere through a caravan around the campfire light
Comes a lovely woman in motion with hair as dark as night
Her eyes were like that of a cat in the dark
That hypnotize me with love

She was a gypsy woman
She was a gypsy woman

She danced around and round to a guitar melody
From the fire her face was all aglow, how she enchanted me
Oh, how I'd like to hold her near
And kiss and forever whisper in her ear

I love you gypsy woman
I love you gypsy woman

All through the caravan she was dancing all night
Waiting for the rising sun, everyone was having fun
I hate to see the lady go knowing she'll never know
I love her, that I love her

Gypsy woman, gypsy woman

I love you gypsy woman
I love you gypsy woman

All through the caravan she was dancing all night
Waiting for the rising sun, everyone was having fun
I hate to see the lady go knowing she'll never know
I love her, that I love her

Gypsy woman, gypsy woman
Gypsy woman, gypsy woman

I love you gypsy woman
I love you gypsy woman
I love you gypsy woman
I love you gypsy woman

Gypsy woman
I love you gypsy woman
Gypsy woman
I love you gypsy woman
