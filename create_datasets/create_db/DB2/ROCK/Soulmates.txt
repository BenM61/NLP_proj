The sea's evaporating
Though it comes as no surprise
These clouds we're seeing
They're explosions in the sky
It seems it's written
But we can't read between the line

Hush
It's okay
Dry your eye
Dry your eye
Soulmate dry your eye
Dry your eye
Soulmate dry your eye
'Cause soulmates never die

This one world vision
Turns us in to compromise
(What good's religion)
(When it's each other we despise)
Damn the government
Damn their killing
Damn their lies (it's okay)

Dry your eyes
Soulmate dry your eyes
Dry your eyes
Soulmate dry your eyes
'Cause soulmates never die

Soulmates never die
Soulmates never die
Soulmates never die
Soulmates never die
Never die
Soulmates never die
Soulmates never die
