Top marks for not trying
So kind of you to bless us
With your effortlessness
We're grateful, so strangely comforted

And I wonder
Are you putting us under
'Cause we can't take our eyes
Off the t-shirt and ties combination?
Well, see you later, innovator

Some want to kiss, some want to kick you
There's not a net you couldn't slip through
Or at least that's the impression I get
'Cause you're smooth, and you're wet
And she's not aware yet
But she's yours

She'll be saying, use me
Show me the jacuzzi
I imagine that it's there, on a plate
You're whole rendezvous rate
Means that you'll never be frightened
To make them wait for a while
I doubt it's your style
Not to get what you set
Out to acquire the eyes are on fire
You are the unforecasted storm
Hup

Calm, collected and commanding
(Top marks for not trying)
You leave the other stories standing
With your renditions and jokes
Bet there's hundreds of blokes
That have wept 'cause you've stolen their

Thunder
Are you putting us under
'Cause we can't take our eyes
Off the t-shirt and ties combination

Well, see you later, innovator
