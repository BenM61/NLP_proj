All this temptation
You tried to give
When I was only looking
For a place to stay

I needed someone to share my heart
But now you tell me
You're going away
It should have been easier

To find a love
But now you've left me
Begging you to stay
You ran away

Leaving me all alone
You ran away
Now I've got no home
You ran away

Now I'm wandering
Alone on this street
I'm searching every place
Where you could be

You ran away
How could you leave me
With no place to stay?
You ran away

Didn't you know
I've got nowhere to go?
