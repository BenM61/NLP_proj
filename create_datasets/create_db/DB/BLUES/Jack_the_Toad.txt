Jerimiah said his peace and fell back in the road
He was shot by Coulee Reese
Who they nick-named Jack The Toad
Just across his shoulder just a little to the right
He heard the click of a 45 hammer
So he throws himself down and he hits the ground
Rolls right over and spins 'round
And with one good shot, just one good shot
He brings that villain right down
In true "Hour Western" manner

Bad, bad news, he was bad, bad news
I knew Coulee, Coulee never lost his cool

A legend grew and Jack The Toad knew
To back up all the talk
One day soon, preferably noon
He's going to have to take the long walk
A poker game and a fast stake
Of these Jack was the master
But a man called Pete
At the end of a dusty dusty street
He's just about six feet
Now he just might, you know he just might
He might be a lttle faster

Bad, bad news, he was bad, bad news
I knew Coulee, Coulee never lost his cool

I'll be blowed, I'll be blowed, I'll be blowed
It's Jack The Toad

I'll be blowed, I'll be blowed, I'll be blowed
It's Jack The Toad

Well it had to happen on a summers' day
When Jack was feeling good
But a friend of a friend, promised a friend of a friend
Promised a friend of a friend he would
But many brave men have said the same thing
Again and again and again
Now Jack, when he went out to face Pete
For the final showdown
He was just a little bit high
He'd been drinking and smoking
And he thought he was so fast
He made the last move
And that was the last move he made

Bad, bad news, he was bad, bad news
I knew Coulee, Coulee never lost his cool

Well now he's gone but his memory lives on
In the mind of every comic strip reader
Some say weren't Jack, some say was camphor
Some say he was just a bleeder
One fact, one fact remain, always be the same
Now on your way through life
Sometimes you just got to be a little bad
I knew Jack and, my goodness, he was bad
He was bad, bad news
You just got to be a little bad because, if you ain't
The great gun fighter in the sky
Ain't got no one to save
And if you're just a little bad
Just a little bad
Nobody forgets your name

Bad, bad news, he was bad, bad news
Bad, oh my goodness, Jack was bad news
