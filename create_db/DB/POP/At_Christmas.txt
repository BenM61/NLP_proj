Last December when we were together
I remember praying it was forever 
Didn't know, like the snow
Our love would melt away

Spring went by and then the summer started
Mid-July, I was still broken-hearted
Autumn leaves have left the trees
But these feelings still remain

Seems I'm not forgetting you as quickly as I wanted to
Now winter's on its way

Yeah, at Christmas, I can't help but miss ya
The memories of you and me, evergreen
It's a time of joy, but for me it's bittersweet

At Christmas, I'm still reminiscing
'Bout everything we used to be, c'est la vie
Yeah, I've spent all year wishing you were here at Christmas

I know moving on is never easy
Wish my heart could change like the seasons
Someone send a happy end
To my winter's tale

Now I'm building me a great big snowman
When I hold him we'll be two hearts frozen
All alone, I'll keep him cold
To make sure that he stays

I am doing my very best but now I face the hardest test
As I've no festive cheer

Yeah, at Christmas, I can't help but miss ya
The memories of you and me, evergreen
It's a time of joy, but for me it's bittersweet

At Christmas, I'm still reminiscing
'Bout everything we used to be, c'est la vie
Yeah, I've spent all year wishing you were here at

Can't help but think about you when I'm all alone
Each time I hear Sinatra on my radio
I'd be in Christmas heaven
If only you were present
Maybe you're somewhere out there on your way to me

Yeah, at Christmas, I can't help but miss ya
The memories of you and me, evergreen
It's a time of joy, but for me it's bittersweet

At Christmas, I'm still reminiscing
'Bout everything we used to be, c'est la vie
Yeah, I've spent all year wishing you were here at Christmas

Oh, at Christmas, oh-oh
Ooh
Yeah, I've spent all year wishing you were here at Christmas
