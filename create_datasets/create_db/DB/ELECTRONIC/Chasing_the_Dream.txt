This ain't about where you been it's about where you wanna be 
And all those years that you spend workin' now you're still on your feet 
You can bring what you want take a minute to breath 
But baby I can't wait forever if you're coming with me 

You better hurry 
'Cause I'm never turning back 
On my way to the place 
You can follow my lead 
'Cause it's a journey 
But we're never coming back 
And it's you and it's me 
Making love as we're chasin' the dream 
As we're chasin' the dream 

And now that you're on your way baby see you're picking up speed 
And everything you thought impossible is within your reach 
You can have what you need when you're chasing the dream 
Can nothing hold you back from gettin to where you wanna be 

You better hurry 
'Cause I'm never turning back 
On my way to the place 
You can follow my lead 
'Cause it's a journey 
But we're never coming back 
And it's you and it's me 
Making love as we're chasin' the dream 
As we're chasin' the dream 

This ain't about where you been it's about where you wanna be 
And all those years that you spend workin' now you're still on your feet 
You can bring what you want take a minute to breath 
But baby I can't wait forever if you're coming with me 

You better hurry 
'Cause I'm never turning back 
On my way to the place 
You can follow my lead 
'Cause it's a journey 
But we're never coming back 
And it's you and it's me 
Making love as we're chasin' the dream 
As we're chasin' the dream
