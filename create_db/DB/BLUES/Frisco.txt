I left my heart in San Francisco
I left my heart, people, in San Francisco
High on the hill, at the Golden Gate, 'cross the bay
In San Francisco, on the hill, the mornin' fog
And the cool, cool night
That's where I wanna be: San Francisco
That's where my heart
Up in New York City
I've been to Chicago
But found no place like San Francisco
With the cable car high, high on the hill
In the mornin' fog
The evening breeze
The cool, cool night
Is where I wanna be
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Work, work people, tell me about it
Work out, work out
I got the blues for San Francisco
Yes, yes, yes, yes
My heart is there, high on the hill
Right down by the Golden Gate, 'cross the bay
That's where I wanna be
I left my heart right there in San Francisco
With the mornin' fog and the cool, cool night, the cable cars on the hill
That's where I wanna be, people
My heart is there, my heart is there, in San Francisco
