Anytime you're feelin' lonely
Anytime you're feelin' blue
Anytime you feel downhearted
That will prove your love for me is true
Anytime you're thinkin' 'bout me
That's the time I'll be thinkin' of you
So anytime you say you want me back again
That's the time I'll come back home to you

Anytime you're thinkin' 'bout me
That's the time I'll be thinkin' of you
So anytime you say you want me back again
That's the time I'll come back home to you
