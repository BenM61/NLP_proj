He was searching
Blindly behind the days
This life and my, no more
Breaking in the, just to stay awake
His heart was like a stone
Uh, his heart looked like a stone

And on the last day
He walked out in the sun
He only just discovered the sun
On the last day
And on the last day
When all this work is done
He only just discovered the sun
On the last day

All the structure, right here all along
In scraps, the dark away
All this grey world
My final breath
It's on the dark and gray
Uh, it's on the dark and day

And on the last day
He walked out in the sun
He only just discovered the sun
On the last day
And on the last day
When all this work is done
He only just discovered the sun
On the last day
