You, you know how to get me so low
My heart had a crash when we spoke
I can't fix what you broke
And you, you always have a reason
Again and again this feelin'
Why do I give in?

And I always was, always was one for cryin'
I always was one for tears

The sun's getting cold; it's snowin'
Looks like an early winter
For us
Looks like an early winter
For us
An early winter
Oh, I need you to turn me over

It's said the map of the world is on you
The moon gravitates around you
The seasons escape you

And I always was, always was one for cryin'
I always was one for tears
No, I never was, I never was one for lyin'
You lied to me all these years

The sun's getting cold; it's snowin'
Looks like an early winter
For us
Looks like an early winter
For us
An early winter
Oh, I need you to turn me over

Why? Why do you act so stupid?
Why? You know that I'm always right

It looks like an early winter
For us
It hurts, and I can't remember sunlight
An early winter
For us
The leaves are changing color
For us
(It gets too much, it gets so much)
Starting over and over, and over again
(It gets too much, it gets so much)
Starting over and over, and over again
(It gets too much, it gets so much)
Well, it looks like an early winter
For us
(It gets too much, it gets so much)
It looks like an early winter
For us
