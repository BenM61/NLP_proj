The light fades up in a brand new heart
First page of a manuscript
Not complete but full of life
A life that struggles on

Seems like the drama never ends
A there are still words untold
The easy parts seem so far away
So far away

My own play, my own play
The show has reached the end
The curtains closing down

Still alone on this stage
I've played my tragic parts
Now I'm just waiting for the end
The end that takes me away

Looks like the last page is reached
And the light is fading out
But the show must keep on going
And the show goes on

My own play, my own play
The show has reached the end
The curtains closing down
