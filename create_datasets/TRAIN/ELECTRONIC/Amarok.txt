Hello everyone
I suppose you think that nothing much is happening at the moment
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha
Well, that's what I want to talk to you all about; endings
Now, endings normally happen at the end
But as we all know, endings are just beginnings
You know, once these things really get started, it's jolly hard to stop them again
However, as we have all come this far, I think, under the circumstances 
The best solution is that we all just keep going
Let's keep this going in sight, never an ending
Let's remember that this world wants fresh beginnings
I feel here, in this country, and throughout the world, 
we are crying out for beginnings, beginnings
We never want to hear this word "endings"
I know we all want to sit down
I know you want to take it easy 
Of course we're looking for the good
Of course we're looking for the fresh start
Isn't that charming? Do you know, I really feel I could dance
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, charming, ha-ha-ha
(Crash!)
