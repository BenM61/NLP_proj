Hey, I can feel it
It's the real thing baby
Well, I can feel it
It's not just a one night thing, baby, look here

Why don't you let yourself forgo, girl?
So the love in you can flow, girl
You said that it's against your morals
You think you'll end up in sorrow

We've know each other
For such a short time
But you're afraid to trust me
So you have to draw the line

Why don't you try me tonight, girl
I swear I'm out of sight, girl
It's alright
So let me love you tonight

I know your daddy always told you
Not to ever trust a stranger
But think all of me, you've known a life time
They can put your heart in danger

Let's put aside our foolish pride
It take a whole lot of woman
To do what she feel inside

So why don't you try me tonight, girl?
I swear I'm out of sight, girl
It's alright
So let me love you tonight

(Our love is alright)
Love knows no time limits
(Our love is alright)
No dates and no numbers
(Our love is alright)
Love only knows what we feel inside
(Our love is alright)
So you don't have to look no further

Why don't you try me tonight, girl?
You can bet your bottom dollar
I'm out of sight, girl

So why don't you try me tonight, girl?
'Cause I'll never, never forget you

I swear it's alright, girl
I need your love, I'll treat you right, girl

I swear it's alright, girl
I need your love and I'll treat you right, girl
