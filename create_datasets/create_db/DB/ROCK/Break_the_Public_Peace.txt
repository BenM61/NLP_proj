We've got to break the public peace
Force those suckers down to their knees
We've got to make them show
That suit and tie guy can't play with us, oh no

We've got to stick together as one
Our fight ain't over, it has just begun
We've got to break the public peace
To save the ones we love, the kids, the trees

So tell your mommy you won't be home for dinner
And tell your daddy you do what he was too scared for
The fight for freedom within yourself
Don't rely on others, it's your choice and no one else's

We won't cut our hair to get a job
We won't act macho to become a cop
We won't suck your dick to be in your scene
We won't wear a suit that's what you call clean

We've got to let them hear our voice
If we want to survive, it's the only choice
We've got to go back to the basics of nature
To discover we're a hell of a creature

Break it, break it, break the public peace!
