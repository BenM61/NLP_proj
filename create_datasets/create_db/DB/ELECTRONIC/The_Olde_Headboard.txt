What becomes a legend most? 
I'll let you think about it, 
Space ghost coast-to-coast. 
While I give thanks today 
For all the things I stole 
And all the things I gave away 
You make experiment, you try to 
Teach a lesson and then take a stand 
A fake handshake don't make no man 

I don't know, about a year ago or so 
I must have made you up in my head 
What did I base you on? 
Was it a broadway show I saw? 
A hot new book I read? 
Half-baked you come at me 
You know I told you not to call here no more. 
The new best friend, the olde headboard. 

Yo no comprendo, mi amour 
Oh no, yo no comprendo. 
The new best friend, the olde headboard 

Where'd you get the dumb idea 
For all the secretive platonic dating? 
I have experience 
In the love and the lives 
Of man and machines 

Yo no comprendo, mi amour 
Oh no, yo no comprendo. 
The new best friend, the olde headboard 

What becomes a legend most? 
The love and lives of man and machine 
Olde headboard 

The love and lives of man and machine 
Olde headboard
