Oh, gimme good sex with your ding-a-dong
Hey, gimme good sex, baby, all night long
It's true, I want to sleep with you
Oh, gimme good sex, be my macho man
Hey, gimme good sex on a one night stand
Please, do, I want to sleep with you
Singin' oh, singin' oh
Singin' oh, singin' oh
I'm Max, I'm Max
I'm better than Fritz
And I'm good for your body and I'm good for your tits
I do it from the front and I do it from behind
Oh, I'm the greatest lover, I'm the best that you will find
I'm Max, I'm Max
I'm bigger than Fred
I'm feeling so fantastic, I'm the best you ever had
I gotta learn uptown and get you in a jam
Sex is more to me, than what you think of man
I'm Max, I'm Max
I'm cooler than John
Baby, I've got the power that will moves you along
I want to make you scream and I want to make you shout
Yes, sex is more than up and down, and more than in and out
I'm Max, I'm Max
I'm hotter than Dick
I'm a master and a beggar, I'm a teacher and a slave
I'm the biggest lover from the land of uncle Sam
Sex is more to me, than what you think of man
I'm Max, I'm Max
I'm cooler than John
Baby, I've got the power that will moves you along
I want to make you scream and I want to make you shout
Yes, sex is more than up and down, and more than in and out
I'm Max, I'm Max
I'm hotter than Dick
I'm a master and a beggar, I'm a teacher and a slave
I'm the biggest lover from the land of uncle Sam
Sex is more to me, than what you think of man
Ohhh
