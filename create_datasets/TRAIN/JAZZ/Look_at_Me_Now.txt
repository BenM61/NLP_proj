I'm not the guy who cared about love,
And I'm not the guy who cared about fortunes and such,
I never cared much,
But look at me now!

And I never knew technique of kissin',
I never knew thrill I could get from your touch,
Never knew much,
Oh! look at me now!

And I'm a new man,
Better than
Casanova at his best;
with a new heart,
a brand new start,
I'm so proud I'm bustin' my vest!

So, I'm the guy who turned down a lover.
So I'm the guy who laughed at those blue diamond rings
One o' those things,
Oh! look at me now!

Oh! look at me now!

I'm a new man,

So, I'm the guy who turned down a lover.
So I'm the guy who laughed at those blue diamond rings
One o' those things,
Oh! look at me now!
Oh! look at me now!
Oh! look at me - now!
