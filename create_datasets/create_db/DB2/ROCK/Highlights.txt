I saw red, I saw green
I think I saw what the whole world's seen
Gotta get away, gotta get away
Cause I know that nothin' lasts forever
In my dreams
But there's a highlight let me be

I need a kick, you need a fix
We are livin' on borrowed time
Generation breakdown destination hellbound
But I know that nothin' lasts forever
Hallucinating, stuck together
There's a highlight let me be
Only you and me

It will blow me away
I will never forget
It took a piece of my soul

One day I will burn my hand
And I'll be resurrected in the promised land
Among the gods I feel power and joy
I made my choice but nothin' will last forever
In my dreams
There's a highlight let me be
Don't let me out

Nothin' will last forever
Hallucinating, stuck together
There's a highlight can't you see
Only you and me

Nothin' will last forever
In my dreams
There's a highlight let me be
