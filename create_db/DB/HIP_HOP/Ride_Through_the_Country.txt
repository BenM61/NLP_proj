Thank y'all, how y'all doin'? Yeh, my names Colt Ford
I just came here to do a little song for y'all
'Bout where I come from, the way I see it
I brought my buddy, Mr. John Michael Montgomery with me
He's gonna play a lil' guitar and sing a lil bit
I'm gonna do a lil sumthin' for y'all
Called 'Ride Through The Country', let's go John

Down the road where the black top ends
You can find Colt Ford with all his friends
We're used to gravel roads, and fishin' with cane poles
Wasn't no swimmin' pools, just swimmin' holes

We was dirt road poor, and cane switched raised
I've been came a long way since back in the day
Been round the world twice seen all fifty states
Ate on thousand dollar china, but love some paper plates
There ain't nuthin' wrong with them big city lights
But me, I prefer them slow country nights
Where I can see the darkness come in and then go

Most folks is honest, and they all speak slow
You can leave your door open, ain't nuttin' gunna happen
Most country folks sing, but I couldn't, so I'm rappin'
I wanna show y'all where I come from
And invite y'all all down to any country town

Now before I pack my things and leave
There's sumthin' I need y'all to understand
I seen alotta things in my life time
That's why I walk the line, I'm just a simple man
And not into things for cheep thrills
But all my scars heel, so don't you ever cry for me
'Cause I ain't ashamed where I'm from, you always will come
To take a ride through the country

Up, dressed, and gone by five am, he's country
And he's rappin' we gottas play him
Folks been waitin' for some one like me
To give 'em some hot beats and spit that country

My jeans don't sag, they fit, and kinda tight
Got on a white t-shirt, no nothin' but work
Daylight til dark, that's how I was bred
And I'll keep bein' country til the day I'm dead

See, country folks eat biscuits called cat heads
Bar-b-q, baked beans, sweet tea, and white bread
We like to fish and hunt, ain't scared of a fight
Love the good Lord and believe in doin' right,

Got four-wheel drives, some got mud on 'em
You can keep your Rolls Royce, 'cause baby
We don't want 'em! So now y'all all know exactly who I am
And if you ain't into that, I don't give a damn!

Now before I pack my things and leave
There's sumthin' I need y'all to understand
I seen a lotta things in my life time
That's why I walk the line, I'm just a simple man
And not into things for cheep thrills
But all my scars heel, so don't you ever cry for me
'Cause I ain't ashamed where I'm from, you always will come
To take a ride through the country

You might see my on your t.v, but honey
That don't mean a thing, you see
I'm still that same ol' country boy
And that's all I'll ever be, and sometime
Those bright lights blind me
And make it hard for me to see
But when I need to be reminded
I take a ride through the country

At about five o'clock on Friday afternoon
Them country boys head down to the local saloon
You welcome to stop in and have a cold bottle
Big city boys and stuck up super models
We don't care where ya from, as long as you polite
'Cause push come to shove and every one of us will fight

We mostly easy like Sunday morning, ol' Colt
Came here to give y'all fair warnin'
Country folks wont be pushed around
And there's some of us livin' in every town
We believe in the Bible, and the U.S.A
Work hard for what you want, it's the American way
Nobody owe you nothin' supposed to earn your keep
Put in a hard day's work, get a good nights sleep

I know some of y'all think Colt's kinda odd
But I'm loud, proud and country by the grace of God!

Now before I pack my things and leave
There's sumthin' I need y'all to understand
I seen a lotta things in my life time
That's why I walk the line, I'm just a simple man
And not into things for cheep thrills
But all my scars heel, so don't you ever cry for me
'Cause I ain't ashamed where I'm from, you always will come
To take a ride through the country
