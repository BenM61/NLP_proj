There they come, oh here we come
Look at them syncopators
Goin' home, oh going home 
Look at those demonstrators
Talk of town
Green and brown
Pickin' 'em up and layin' 'em down

Prancin' fools (oh prancin' fools)
That's what they like to call' em
They're in a class of their own
The only way for them to lose is to cheat 'em 
You may try but you'll never beat 'em
Strut that stuff
They don't do nothin' different
Cake walkin' babies from home
