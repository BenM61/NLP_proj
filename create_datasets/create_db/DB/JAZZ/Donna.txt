Oh 
Once upon a looking-for-Donna-time 
There was a sixteen year old virgin 
Oh Donna oh oh Donna oh oh oh 
Looking for my Donna 

I just got back from looking for Donna 
San Francisco 
Psychedelic urchin 
Oh Donna oh oh Donna oh oh oh 
Looking for my Donna 

Have you seen 
My sixteen year old tattooed woman 
Heard a story 
She got busted for her beauty oh oh oh 
Oh oh! 

Once upon a looking-for-Donna-time 
There was a sixteen year old virgin 
Oh Donna oh oh Donna oh oh oh 
Looking for my Donna 

I've been to India and saw the yogi light (lie?) 
In South America the Indian smoke glows bright 
I'm reincarnated and so are we all 
And in this lifetime we'll rise 
Before we fall 
Before we fall 

Once upon a looking-for-Donna-time 
There was a sixteen year old virgin 
Oh Donna oh oh Donna oh oh oh 
Looking for my Donna 

And I'm going to show her 
Life on earth can be sweet 
Gonna lay my mutated head (self) at her feet 
And I'm gonna love her make love to her 
Till the sky turns brown 
I'm evolving I'm evolving 
Through the drugs 
That you put down 

Once upon a looking-for-Donna-time 
There was a sixteen year old virgin 
Oh Donna oh oh Donna oh oh oh 
Looking for my Donna 
Looking for my Donna 

Donna!
