Breathe it in, breathe it out
Flying high ain't no doubt
I take it to the head yo love
On a ride, in the clouds
Feeling good won't come down
I take it to the head yo love

Stepped in the room I saw you
Instantly knew I had to
Present my game and keep it cool
Wanted so much to kiss you 
To let you know I miss you
I just laid back and let you move

Fronting like you don't want me
Acting like you don't need me
But it's okay that's just your way
There's a physical attraction 
Cause a chemical reaction
So come on boy
Inhale...exhale

The time is right for romance
And I want you for my man
I know you want me for your girl
Baby I know you're willing 
So let's not fight the feeling
Give it to me and rock my world

Don't have to feel you
Just when I'm near 
Where are you at
Get a contact
Got my head spinning
I'm in a whirlwind of your love
And it's got me all choked up
