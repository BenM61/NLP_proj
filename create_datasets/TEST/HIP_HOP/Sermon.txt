You don't have to say you're sorry
Or redeem yourself to me, oh
I'm not asking for confessions
You don't even have to speak, no

I need you to feel that you're more than enough
I already know you're deserving of love
It's not a question that you are the one that I need

These are my words, this is my voice, that is my sermon
Give me your heart, give me your pain, give me your burden
'Cause I can take anything that you can give
Forgiving everything that you did
These are my words, this is my voice, that is my sermon
My sermon, yeah, yeah, yeah
My sermon, yeah, yeah, yeah
My sermon, yeah, yeah, yeah
My sermon, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, time to turn this wine to water, yeah
Time to turn this gold to lead, oh
Time to stop taking this for granted, oh
Gotta keep my family fed, for life

I need you to feel that you're more than enough
I already know you're deserving of love
It's not a question that you are the one that I need

These are my words, this is my voice, that is my sermon
Give me your heart, give me your pain, give me your burden
'Cause I can take anything that you can give
Forgiving everything that you did
These are my words, this is my voice, that is my sermon
My sermon, yeah, yeah, yeah
My sermon, yeah, yeah, yeah
My sermon, yeah, yeah, yeah
My sermon, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I don't know nothing about the service the clergy do in the churches
I never read the book though I knew the pages were turning
I tried to sing the hymns but I couldn't think of the verses
Tried to confess my sins, but I didn't know how to word it
But this is my sermon, 'fess that I'm emotionally drained
Self-medicating hoping I can cope with the pain
I need a face 'cause that'll fix whatever's broke in my brain
Who am I kidding, no, I'm going insane
I wrote some quotes on this page, just trying to reach, and I hope you were late
Well, I'll probably just throw them away
'Cause I don't know what to say
I feel weak when I'm supposed to be brave
I seem free but I'm enclosed in a cage
Though I continue to ponder over the plastic
And I ain't gonna do any better
Do I whimper from the future, and buckle under the pressure
Or do I step to the plate, and gon' take the chance with my life
And come face-to-face with the darkness so I can stand in the light, like?

When I feel your love upon me
I know that I am truly blessed
Sometimes we've gotta face the darkness
Just get me to the light again

Oh, these are my words, my voice, that is my sermon
Give me your heart, give me your pain, give me your burden
'Cause I can take anything that you can give
Forgiving everything that you did
These are my words, this is my voice, that is my sermon
My sermon, yeah, yeah, yeah
My sermon, yeah, yeah, yeah
My sermon, yeah, yeah, yeah
My sermon, yeah, yeah, yeah
My sermon, yeah, yeah, yeah
My sermon, yeah, yeah, yeah
My sermon, yeah, yeah, yeah
My sermon, yeah, yeah, yeah
That is my sermon
