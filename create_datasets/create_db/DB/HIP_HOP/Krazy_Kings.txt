[Bigg Jus] 
I swing boomerangs and murder air attacks 
Blow out busted internet  access info out your back 
Clip cut you off  I'm too advanced for your little cause 
Pole position  my verbal contact no life support 
We'll maintain position  lift off to ignition 
Frequency feedback provide ammunition 
The brain cells panic sell two tons of the IQ 
When the energy starts to fornicate  that's when I punch through 
All type hard rock tracks that's hard to the max 
It's spacey like mixing up angel dust and crack 
Yo wait a God damned pagan minute, then pause on that 
My styles the man like the Ku Klux Klan be from deep down south 
Don't let one of these little emcees get lost on the wrong route 
Catch a Mississippi Burning f*ck that then catch an arson 
Land mines, destruction, Far Rockaway to Carson 
You couldn't locate my synthy format using LoJack 
Bitch I'm all that 
Scratch the bed numbers straight off your girls' back 
In fact black the injection of my lethal status 
Will ultimately break all beats down into antimatter 
You couldn't hang if you was bit by a radioactive spider 
I'm intrigued, your lackluster broken charted style 
Is unkempt and wild causing mayhem 
The battle rhymer mixed with tonic and El-P is fucking lethal 
Like a African disease killer people 
And it's true I'm messing with your whole crew till you're bogling 
Cause your style is now off with a blast of the force 
It's the classic underground styles of the urban masters 
The Krazy Kings these thinking caps be sparking tags quick x4 
It's been rated combustible 
Computer animated T2 
Winds up enzyme fractal poly-residue 
When taking away what little time that I got 
The mind view in energy oxen I pick the combination spot 
When in 1985 they injected me with props 
Ten years of misdirected blacks killing, I'm back on the block 
Recuperating from the never-ending bloodshed of the war 
Though my pockets remain empty, my soul remains pure 
Retained it exists laid a whole education 
For the new rebirth of a super space station 
Practicing the science of shooting the planets from a distance 
While escaping without conscience of existence 
Or would be laws no matter how much I resistance 
From somewhere wicked in the West this way comes 
It seems that we underestimated Satan once again 
Time marches on but some and then some blends 
Into the recess of all starving no content 
All for the form of better communication 
I bet you wish you could eliminate the whole lower class population 
I be the fund raiser for my own expedition 
A pro-black family mind reconditioning 
For the multi-colored Pumas are no longer the flavor 
Unless you're one of those techno transient jungle ravers 
It's the classic underground styles of the urban masters 
The Krazy Kings be thinking caps and sparking tags quick x4 
I strike a match for you two dollar MC's that can't burn 
This is for your own concern 
I burn images in retinas for all you bitches faking 
You couldn't download my multi-disk without penetrating 
Complex quotes set to explode off of impact 
But it sees to that disco boogie mayhem dance track 
Lookie bitch at poetry that's on track like a bookie 
More heads be jocking my shit than a droptop at dookie 
Peep this, put together the form into pieces 
That form the eight steps for your mind increases 
Another ass whipping slashing my burn to pieces 
It's mad bogus, I'm fading in and out of focus 
Cock shoot cops tax me, I'm taxing you 
My gunshots scream nerve wracking, heads is pushing through 
Intensity, I booby-trap all known vicinities 
Leave you stinking like face guts in a dumpster in Little Italy 
It's the classic underground styles of the urban masters 
The Krazy Kings be thinking caps and sparking tags quick x8
