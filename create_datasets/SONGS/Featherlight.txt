Parallels in daily life, I'm guessing it's not a lie
You're giving me something to fall to
I'm saying that I know you're perfect and cloudless
I'll hold on to maybe a bit of you

Only when I feel I'm falling, will I fall for you
And I'll be featherlight, I'll float right in to view
But will I get there, or will I wonder if you'll blow me loose
'Cause I feel featherlight, I might just float on through

I'm feeling insane but my heart, it gets it
So climb up upon there for a better view
Will you stay the same here, nowhere, and satisfied
In order to combine me and you

Only when I feel I'm falling, will I fall for you
And I'll be featherlight, I'll float right in to view
But will I get there, or will I wonder if you'll blow me loose
'Cause I feel featherlight, I might just float on through

Is it for me, does it feel right, love is so bright
Inside pulling at heart strings, I've tried it but I like it
When I'm free to see the moon's dark side for a while
Is it why I'm low, does anybody know

Only when I feel I'm falling, will I fall for you
And I'll be featherlight, I'll float right in to view
But will I get there, or will I wonder if you'll blow me loose
'Cause I feel featherlight, I might just float on through
