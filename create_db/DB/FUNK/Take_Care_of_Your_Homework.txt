Got to tell you true
I got to tell you true
Oh brother Jack you goin' with sister Sadie
When you ought to be home with your old lady 
But your hearts divided in so many pieces
Tryin' to please them both 
Never pleasing neither
Oh Jack take it on back

Before your good thing is gone
Because the downfall of too many men
Is up keep of too many women
Take care of your homework fella
Because somebody will, oh yeah 
You better take care of your homework, fella
If you don't somebody will

Now wait a minute here
Oh brother Fred how you can run 
Staying out all night leaving his homework undone
Now Fred's old lady took as much as she could stand
Then one night the next door neighbor
Taken her in hand
Now fellas let me tell you 
These girls are getting hip
You can only slide so long
Before you make a slip
Take care of your homework, fella
If you don't somebody else will
