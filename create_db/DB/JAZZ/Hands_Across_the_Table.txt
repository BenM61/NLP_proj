Dinner is ended, the music is grand
Softly the lantern's gleam
Isn't it splendid to sit hand in hand
Silently lost in a dream?

Hands across the table
While the lights are low
Though you hush your lips, your fingertips
Tell me all I want to know

Hands across the table
Meet so tenderly
And they say in their little way 
That you belong to me

Silence is golden, so do not reply
And I shall understand
All can be told in a look of your eye
And in a touch of your hand

Hand across the table
While the lights are low
Though you hush your lips, your fingertips
Tell me all I want to know

Hands across the table
Meet so tenderly
And they say in their little way 
That you belong to me
