I'ma make your love come down
I'm just in my zone

Tell me that she's prayin'
Mama keep sayin', my love is for true
I know you're waiting, need to be patient
I'm coming for you
If we're gonna make this work out
I need you to play your role
Then we can roll
I'm on a roll

I'ma make your love come down
I'ma make your love, make your love come down
Gotta take you all the way down
I'ma make your love, make your love come down

Ah my pretty little mama like woah
Knows I'm a bad stone
And she don't moan if I don't come back home
Knows what the kid does, don't cause I'm naughty
Knows when I'm with strippers gettin' 'em naughty for me
Holy for drinkin', knows what I'm thinkin'
Man, I've got a couple of chicks that I'm linkin'
Long time, pace, I'ma set it for her on sight
Baby you better believe that I'll be on right
She don't care about the rose gold
Care what them other chickenheads don't know, know
Better, baby I'll make your love come down
She's fallin' for me now
She nice up, everyting tight up
And that's why it's her street that I'm right up
Plus I don't wanna roll over the internet
My baby crisp, but I don't want strings yet

You, you make me
You got me in a way, go crazy
You, you take me
No one could make you feel no better
Ooh go getter
I'ma make you rain, no wetter
Tell me right now cause I'm on the way down
I'm gon love you right now

I'ma make your love come down
I'ma make your love, make your love come down
Gotta take you all the way down
I'ma make your love, make your love come down

My pretty little mama like ow
Make your love come down
Come and check me for a one great round
Never cuff her when the sun stays down
Never say you don't touch base
You can do you, never troubling cuh it's alright, all the while
I'm still in love with how you perform, I sure try
Duckin' from trouble, buy even more friends worldwide
Game got her sittin' courtside
She don't care about the iced out, pinkie, lights out
Rocky with my styles
She keep my mind fucked, what is my lifestyle?
Ziggy, we might bump until you timeout
Silly, so don't be playin' 'round
Where you at? I'm comin' over, but ain't staying round
Baby, I'm about to lay it down
Feel you up and then I'll take you down

You make me
You got me in a way, go crazy
You take me
No one could make you feel no better
Ooh go getter

Tell me right now cause I'm on the way down
I'ma love you right now
