Smiling face and loving eyes
But you keep on telling me all those lies
How do you expect me to believe
Honey I ain't that naive

Baby I got my eye on you
'Cause you do all the things I want you to
Stop your cryin' and dry your tears
I ain't that wet behind the ears

You can throw me lefts
And you can throw me rights
But where was you last night
Beating around the bush

Wish I knew what's on your mind
Why you being so unkind?
Remember those nights we spent alone
Talkin' on the telephone?

Thoughts of you goin' through my brain
You told me that you felt the same
You said that you loved me too
But tell me who was there with you

I was talking birds and you was talking bees
And was he down on his knees
Beatin' 'round the bush

You're the meanest woman I've ever known
Sticks and stones won't break my bones
I know what you're looking for
You eaten your cake, you want some more
I'm gonna give you just a one more chance
Try to save our romance
Done everything I'm gonna do
The rest is up to you

You can chew it up
And you can spit it out
Let it all hang out
Beating around the bush, oh

Chew it up, spit it out
Let it all hang out,
Beating around the bush
