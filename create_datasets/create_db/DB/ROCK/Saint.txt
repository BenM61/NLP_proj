I'm taking my time
I'll fix it, don't worry now
I'm needing you there
Make sure that you're coming too

All of my life
Is all I'll give you here
The meaning of me
Is something to pursue

You think I'm a saint
It's in your pretty head
Stretched out like a saint now
I love you to death

Catch another dream now
We can find them somehow
I know that there's a boy inside the man
Catch another dream now
Take all we are allowed
For I know that there's a man inside the boy

Grown ups don't know
How to dream anymore
Their heads in the sand
And they choose to ignore it all

All of my life
Is all I'll give you here
The meaning of me
Is something to pursue

You think I'm a saint
It's in your pretty head
Stretched out like a saint now
I love you to death

Catch another dream now
We can find them somehow
I know that there's a boy inside the man
Catch another dream now
Take all we are allowed
For I know that there's a man inside the boy

You think I'm a saint
It's in your pretty head
Stretched out like a saint now
I love you to death

Catch another dream now
We can find them somehow
I know that there's a boy inside the man
Catch another dream now
Take all we are allowed
For I know that there's a man inside the boy

Catch another dream now
We can find them somehow
I know that there's a boy inside the man
Catch another dream now
Take all we are allowed
For I know that there's a man inside the boy

A man inside the boy
You think I'm a saint
It's in your pretty head
