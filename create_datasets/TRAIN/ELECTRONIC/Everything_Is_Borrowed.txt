This is my hour, I'm never going to bed
The sky is still black, but begs to be red
I just put my book down, but it begs to be read
I'm not nod, I'm not napper, never rest my head
Some days I feel I'm getting smaller and smaller
But some nights, I seem to grow taller and taller
And we keep shrinkin' and shrinkin' but this will not finish
You're never nothing, if you didn't disappear
Just when I discovered the meaning of life, they change it
Just when I'm loving life, it seems to start raining
I pulled the sail safe switch, sea sail and I'm into the stars
I love the rain out my skies. The sky's now red, my eyes reflect jets
Smiling at this blessing, this life is the best

I came to this world with nothing
And I leave with nothing but love
Everything else is just borrowed

I want to notice chances I've passed without notice
I want to see details previously veiled
I want to grab that chance, carry it home
So I can marry and know
That I noticed every chance
That I could have passed without notice
I saw details that to all were veiled
And I grabbed those chances, carried them home
And then I'll have had it with roaming

I came to this world with nothing
And I leave with nothing but love
Everything else is just borrowed

I want to speak every cliche but tweak if I've seen change
In new way it could be said

If it's bleak, or if the week's leaking down the street
Or if any days wasted I want to face facts
My time on this earth is my only penny
Wise is the gent counting every moment spent
I don't want to explain things, don't wanna fill in the gaps
I want to look at my friends and in that minute be at(? )

Memories are times we borrow
For spending tomorrow
Memories are times we borrow
For spending tomorrow

I came to this world with nothing
And I leave with nothing but love
Everything else is just borrowed

If spit like luck, you can only seem
To borrow it, you can't keep it
When the wind of change whistles into play
Will I blink or flinch away?
The wind of change won't whistle me away
If I spin my tails and sail
And sail away, let yesterday become today

I came to this world with nothing
And I leave with nothing but love
Everything else is just borrowed

As time will say, nothing but
I told you so

Memories are times we borrow
For spending tomorrow
