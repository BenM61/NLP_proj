Gliding down through the dark green water. 
He can breathe under water because he has amphibious nostrils. 
On the way down he passed hundreds of trout of different sizes. 
Trout are freshwater fish and have under water weapons.

Keep away from the trout. 

Why should it mean that the fish in the sea are all unable to sing?

Eating fish! 

Fish fish fish fish fish. 
Fish fish fish fish. 
Eating fish! 

I wish that I could get my hands on a dozen fish! 
Fish! 
Fish!
