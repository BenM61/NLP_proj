April played the fiddle
And my heart began to dance
And I was so surprised to find
My arms around romance
 
April played the fiddle
And I memorized the tune
And later on a dream and I
Went singing to the moon
 
Then may began to gossip
And June just winked her eye
And you should have seen
The know-it-all expression on July
 
April played the fiddle
Ah but here's the funny part
I had to pay the fiddler
With my one and only heart
