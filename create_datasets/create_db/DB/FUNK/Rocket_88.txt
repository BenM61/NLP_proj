You women have heard of jalopies
You've heard the noise they make
Let me introduce my new Rocket 88

Yeah, she's straight, just won't wait
Everybody likes my Rocket 88
Babe we'll ride in style movin' all along

A V8 motor baby, it's modern design
Black convertible top and the girls don't mind
Sportin' with me riding all around town with joy

Everybody in my car's gonna take a little nip
Move on out, movin' and cruisin' along
Here we go, here we go
