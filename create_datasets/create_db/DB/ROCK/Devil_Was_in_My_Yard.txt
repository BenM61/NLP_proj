Now the Devil was in my yard then
But the Devil ain't in my yard no more
Now the Devil was in my car then
But the Devil ain't in my car no more

How long, long girl? How long?
How long 'till you know that?
How long, long girl? How long?
How long?

Devil was in my yard then
But the Devil ain't in my yard no more
Now the Devil was in my car then
But the Devil ain't in my car no more

I'm gonna make it
I'm gonna make it
But whenever I break you I will not see you
But whenever I break you I will not see you

I'm gonna make it
I'm gonna make it
But whenever I break you I will not see you
But whenever I break you I will not see you

But whenever I break you I will not see you
But whenever I break you I will not see you

Oh, Devil was in my yard
Oh, Devil was in my yard
