I've got something pouring,
through a personal atlas,
and if the weather was warning,
even heaven should practice.

I've got something drawing,
like a column that's our own,
and if the weather was warning,
the stars are drifting the shallows.

How can ya', how can ya' look so gloomy,
When you're gloomy, howlin', look so good to me,
How can ya', how can ya' look so gloomy,
When you're gloomy, howlin', look so good to me.

Be my night,
be my night.

You take on everything,
in a peculiar manner,
and if I'd be so reckless,
but I'll just tremble and stammer.

How can ya', how can ya' look so gloomy,
When you're gloomy, howlin', look so good to me,
How can ya', how can ya' look so gloomy,
When you're gloomy, howlin', look so good to me.

How can ya', how can ya' look so gloomy,
When you're gloomy, howlin', look so good to me,
How can ya', how can ya' look so gloomy,
When you're gloomy, howlin', look so good to me.

How can ya', how can ya' look so gloomy,
When you're gloomy, howlin', look so good to me,
How can ya', how can ya' look so gloomy,
When you're gloomy, howlin', look so good to me.
