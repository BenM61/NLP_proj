Yo uh huh
I'ma try something different on this right here
But I know y'all goin' feel it
Cause I know y'all feel me
It's some real shit right here you know what I'm saying?
I ain't never did it like this before
Check this out

[Snoop]
I'm the kind of g that everybody knows
But I'm so low key when it comes to hoes
I never break the rules and that's just how it goes
All my friends and foes know that's just how it goes
I can flip the script but I chose not to this time
There's so much to say with so little time but I like it
Yes I like it
I'm goin' dip dive socialize and get high
I wish my people had other ways
I'm thankful that a brother's paid that a brother's paid
But how can I be happy my hair is still nappy
I miss my grand pappy
I want to do right but the world is wrong
That's why I'm singin' this song

[Chorus]
I'm trying to stack a dollar pop my collar while I'm singin my song
Y'all niggas better leave me alone I think you better leave me alone
I think y'all better leave me alone I think you better leave me alone
I'm trying to stack a dollar pop my collar while I'm singin my song
You bitches better leave me alone I think you better leave me alone
I think y'all better leave me alone I think you better leave me alone

[Snoop]
There's so much going on out there in the world today
All these ladies players gangsters and suckers
I get caught up sometimes some of the people I hang with
They turn out to be snitches bitches yeah they switches
But you know like I know I can't stop doing what I got to do
I'ma keep doing what I got to I'ma keep doing y'know
Everywhere I go the game is the same
People looking at me want me to say something
Want me to do something but I don't know nothing
If I ain't getting paid I can't drop no rhymes
I can't do nothing for you no mo' I ain't got that kinda time
And they know

[Chorus]

[Snoop]
I try to be to myself and try to stay away from the world
But the world just keeps running after me running after me
I try to shield myself away from all the wickedness
But somehow the wickedness is in my circle what am I to do
I try to ask god to help me get through this
What am I to do to this just do this let's do this
So I continue to mash day by day day by day
I continue to play play by play
And I continue to spit my manuscript spit it
And say what I want to say say it
And I do it to ya every day

[Chorus]

[Snoop]
Leave me alone I think you better leave me alone
Leave me alone leave me alone better leave me alone
If it don't pay you wrong leave me alone
I think you better leave me alone leave me alone
Leave me alone, leave me alone
If it don't pay you wrong
