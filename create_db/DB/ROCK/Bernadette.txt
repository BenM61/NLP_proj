You and me in our playhouse
Living in a veil 
We never need to go without
Memories bring no joy or peace
We are alone 
And all we need

Tuning out of the poison
Every waking day
Intolerance to overcome
Fortunes won by the boys with the guns
We are alone 
Nowhere to run

Bernadette
You are my liberty
I celebrate the day 
That you changed my history of life and death
Will always lead you into love and regret
But you have answers 
And I have the key for the door to Bernadette

Winding down our emotions
Family and friends 
Becoming ghosts to dream of and pass on 
Time will erase every face, every name
We are alone 
No-one to blame

Bernadette
You are my liberty
I celebrate the day 
That you changed my history of
Life and death
Will always lead you into love and regret
But you have answers
And I have the key 
To Bernadette

(Bernadette)
