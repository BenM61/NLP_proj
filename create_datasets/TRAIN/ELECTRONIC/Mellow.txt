I hear the ocean beat upon the shore outside my room.
Calling me up from sleep to listen to her graceful tune.
She makes me feel alive, her power more than words can say.
Send shivers through my person, clears my head to face the day.

I pray
The tides will rise and fall again.

I see the sun rise up into a cloudless sky of blue.
Coaxing the shadows back to let the sun's light shine on through.
I feel it touch my skin, its warmth glows through right to my bones.
Drifts softly through my body, heats my flesh then stirs my soul.

I pray
The sun will surely rise today.
And I will not take for granted
That what is there for me.
