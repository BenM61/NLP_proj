I never thought it would happen to me
I was the one that they said would break free
Broken promises settled the night
He told me he was my Mr. Right

And I believed in all that was there
And now it seems I'm living with regret
Now I'm counting down the days so afraid
Can't rewind or freeze the frame

Its too late
Its too late

Can't you see the need in me
I'm keeping my baby
Can't you see the need in me
I'm keeping my baby, baby, baby, baby

I've lived a lie and now I face the truth
Twenty weeks and what am I to do
Now it seems I'm going alone
A stereotype with a government home
I reside to try and to survive
No hope for me but this child deserves a life
Now I'm counting down the days so afraid
Can't rewind or freeze the frame

Its too late oh
Its too late

Can't you see the need in me
I'm keeping my baby
Can't you see the need in me
I'm keeping my baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

Can't you see the need in me
I'm keeping my baby
Can't you see the need in me
I'm keeping my baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby
