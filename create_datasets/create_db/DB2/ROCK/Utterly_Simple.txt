Everything really is stupidly simple
And yet all around is utter confusion
Fairy tales written may help you to see it
Do you understand about Lewis's Alice?
We fit all our lives into regular patterns
All that we really know is that we're really living

(spoken:
The man that seeks the world, his wisdom seeks to know his mind
And knowing where his feet should walk, and when he should or should not
talk And have a friend to find
Don't look around to find the sound that's right beneath your feet
The hermit sits inside his cave and seeks to know his mind
Staring into empty space and seeing things in people's faces others cannot find
Don't look around to find the sound that's right beneath your feet)

We've nothing to hide so why try to hide it?
I know there are some but they're screwed up inside
If you need a reason for all this I'm singing
It's simpleness really that gives it its meaning
