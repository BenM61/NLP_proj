Who knows what the winds gonna bring when the invalids sing 
"La la's" with a powerful sting that'll stop any opera or any Bing 
Sing, spread the news across the land 
All winners will be also-rans 
Achoo - one size fits everyone 
Achoo - one breath, the deed has been done 

Grey hair and a dash and a flair give your doctor an air 
I'm hurt, but the choice that you made is an obvious one 
For a girl who needs care 
I do hope that he makes you well 
Say, is there any cure for Hell
Achoo - one size fits everyone 
Achoo - one breath, the deed has been done 
Sing, Ile de France and everywhere 
You can't ignore that sort of air 
Achoo - one size fits everyone 
Achoo - one breath, the deed has been done 

So, open wide, open wide and say, open wide and say goodbye, you'll be ok

Achoo - he's gonna whisk you away 
Achoo - he's gonna make you ok
