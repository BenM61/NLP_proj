Come here sister, Papa's in the swing 
He ain't too hip, about that new breed thing 
He ain't no drag 
Papa's got a brand new bag 

Come here mama, and dig this crazy scene 
He's not too fancy, but his mind is might clean 
He ain't no drag. 
Papa's got a brand new bag 

He's doing the Jerk,  
He's doing the Fly 
Don't play him cheap 'cause you know he ain't shy 
He's doing the Monkey, the Mashed Potatoes, 
Jump back Jack, See you later alligator. 

Come here sister 
Papa's in the swing 
He ain't too hip now 
But I can dig that new breed babe; 
He ain't no drag 
He's got a brand new bag 

Oh papa!  He's doing the Jerk 
Papa, he's doing the Jerk 
He's doing the twist,  just like this, 
He's doing the Fly ev'ry day and ev'ry night 
The thing's, like the Boomerang. 
Hey, come on 
Hey! Hey, come on 
Hey! Hey, he's put tight, out of sight,  
Come on. Hey! Hey!
