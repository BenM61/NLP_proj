To be alone again
Without you, without you
When will this time pass?

Maybe I should talk
Perhaps I should not
But it's gone, what is gone
Who can say?

Like leaves that drift away
So softly, they tell me
I'll walk without you
Your name inside me

No wind will hide me
Like a song, no regrets
When it's done
