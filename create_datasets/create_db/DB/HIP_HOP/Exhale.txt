Everyone falls in love sometime
Sometimes it's wrong, and sometimes it's right
For every win, someone must fail
But there comes a point when
When we exhale
Yeah, yeah, say

Shoop, shoop, shoop
Shoop be doop, shoop, shoop
(Yeah)
Shoop be doop, shoop, shoop
(All you got to say is shoo be doop)
Shoop be doop, shoop, shoop
Shoop be doop, shoop, shoop
(Shoo be doop)
Shoop be doop, shoop, shoop
Shoop be doop, shoop, shoop
Shoop be doop

Sometimes you'll laugh
Sometimes you'll cry
Life never tells us, the when's or why's
When you've got friends, to wish you well
You'll find your point when
You will exhale
(Yeah, yeah, say)

Shoop, shoop, shoop
Shoop be doop, shoop, shoop
Shoop be doop, shoop, shoop
(Shoo shoo shoo huh)
Shoop be doop, shoop, shoop
Shoop be doop, shoop, shoop
(Shoo be)
Shoop be doop, shoop, shoop
(Say shoop say shoo be say shoo be)
Shoop be doop, shoop, shoop
(Say shoo-hoo say sho)
Shoop be doop

Hearts are often broken
When there're words unspoken
In your soul there's answers to your prayers
If you're searching for a place you know
A familiar face, somewhere to go
You should look inside yourself
And you're halfway there

And sometimes you'll laugh
And sometimes you'll cry
Life never tells us, the when's or why's
But when you've got friends, to wish you well
You'll find your point when
You will exhale
Say

Shoop, shoop, shoop
(Shoo be)
Shoop be doop, shoop, shoop
(Shoo be)
Shoop be doop, shoop, shoop
(Shoo be)
Shoop be doop, shoop, shoop
(Shoo-hoo-hoo be)
Shoop be doop, shoop, shoop
(Shoo be doop doop doop hoo hoo hoo)
Shoop be doop, shoop, shoop
(Do do shoo be shoo be feels alright)
Shoop be doop, shoop, shoop
(You can say oh)
Shoop be doop
