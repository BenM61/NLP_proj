Love is gone
My TV's on
I'm hanging with the boys
A life with fools

This world is cruel
We never dispense with toys
Could you make a suggestion
For an act I would enjoy

I'm drowning
So come inside
Welcome to my filthy mind

I'm drowning
So come inside
Welcome to my filthy mind

My fingers are burnt
Forgot what I learnt
I'll never be a satisfied
Become a recluse

Enjoy the abuse
It's better to just get high
Now I feel like a baby
Who has just opened its eyes

I'm drowning
So come inside
Welcome to my filthy mind
I'm drowning
So come inside
Welcome to my filthy mind
