Yeah
G-you-why 2-k-4, yeah

Two zero zero four


In the year 2004 
Life will be like one big party
The sensation of cultural unity
Hatin' is over and there's positivity
This is a new world, some things haven't changed
Yo, a party is a party no matter what day
There are angels laced in platinum robes
And a Benz is still a Benz, wheels dipped in chrome
The ladies are still fly with futuristic styles
You know flossin ain't over, it's just computerized
So now tell me is the fugure what you thought it would be?
For every cloudy vision is now reality
Now these words you hear is not meant to scare
But in fact they're here to make you aware
So just like before, you know, in the past
The future's what we make it
So let's make it last
Get on yo' ass
G-you-why-2-K, 'bove y'all








Take it to the bridge
