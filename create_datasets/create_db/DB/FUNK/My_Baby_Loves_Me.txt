MY BABY LOVES ME	
Martha and The Vandellas

My baby loves me, oh yeah
My baby needs me, oh yeah
No other guy can whisper sweet things in my ear
My sweetie pie has the only sweet voice I hear, so clear
So he needs me, oh yeah
My baby loves me, oh yeah
I'm telling you he needs me
Oh yes he does
Can't seem to see no other handsome face
There's just no cute substitute can 
Take my baby's place
Cause I know he needs me, oh yeah 
I will never, never give my baby no trouble
Whenever he calls me I come runnin' on the double
Cause my baby loves me, oh yeah
And he needs me, yes he does
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Now nobody can tell me the place
Where I'm going wrong, oh no
Nobody could ever erase the love so strong
Cause I know he loves me
He told me that he needs me
I know he loves me
Can't do without me, oh no
