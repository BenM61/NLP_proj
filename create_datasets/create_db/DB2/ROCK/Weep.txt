She turns she burns she feels concealed by someone that she doesn't know 
She hopes some day he'll find his way into these tears that she weeps 
She knows she gave she feels enslaved by what she gave too easily 
She hopes in time she waits in line for all these things that will make her 
Real 

I feel that she woke up feel she's had enough 
Feel it's time she opened up her eyes 
I feel that she woke up feel she's had enough 
Feel it's time she opened up her eyes 

She holds the cold she feels so fooled by all this pain she has revealed 
She hopes she cries she holds inside all these things that will make her real 

I feel that she woke up feel she's had enough 
Feel it's time she opened up her eyes 
I feel that she woke up feel she had enough 
Feel it's time she opened up her eyes 

She screams put your hands on me 
Put your hands on me put your hands on I need to feel you touch 
Put your hands on me put your hands on I need to feel you touch 

I feel that she woke up feel she's had enough 
Feel it's time she opened up her eyes 
I feel that she woke up feel she had enough 
Feel it's time she opened up her eyes 

I feel she's got to open up her eyes
Put your hands on me
