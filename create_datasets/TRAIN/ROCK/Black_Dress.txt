Will she walk slowly
Or will she come at all
I can't believe that I was watching
Can't believe I made the call

I can't get a handle on my thoughts now
Guess I've already made my mind
He's a soldier in my battle
I'm the king with too much time

Will she wear that black dress
Will she wear that black dress
As holy as the night
As holy as I want to feel

I want to feel all right
What if she is angry
I know that were both scared
Do I look her in the eye or do I even dare to care

I'm drowning in desire
I've been good for so long
I know I've got no right now
But no one can tell me that I'm wrong

Will she wear that black dress
Will she wear that black dress
As holy as the night
As holy as I want to feel

I want to feel all right
Maybe Ill be good
I could be gone when she gets here
I've still got a chance to make this one all right

My temptations on the stairway
My temptations at the door
My temptation is before me
She is standing before me in that black dress
