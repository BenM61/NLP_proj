Billy's called, he's got the van
And Ian's got a set of drums
And I borrowed this old guitar
We're hoping some day we'll all go far

And maybe we'll write a tune
And drive in a limousine
See our picture in a magazine
So won't you be there

Cum hear the band on Friday night, oh yeah
Cum hear the band it'll be alright, oh yeah
And baby it's you that's got me burnin' inside
So cum hear the band it'll be alright, it'll be alright

Cause baby it's you, that keeps me so turned on
Baby it's you, seein' me right when I'm wrong
And I can't keep it inside, cause I won't know till I've tried
So baby, what you want me to do

We practiced hard to get it on
Working to get it strong
Now I just want you to hear
But it won't work if you're not there

So please don't take too long
I'm waiting with a song
So won't you please be there
Won't you be there

Cum hear the band on Friday night, oh yeah
Cum hear the band it'll be alright, oh yeah
And baby it's you that's got me burnin' inside
So cum hear the band it'll be alright, it'll be alright
It'll be alright, it'll be alright
