If you talked about me
Behind my back
Let me hear it from you
Let me hear it from you

And if another man has hold of you
Woman, because of something I lack
Let me hear it from you
Let me hear it from you

It's bad if you fell me
But it's not so bad if you tell me
So if you do anything I wouldn't want you to do, girl
Let me hear it from you, yeah
Let me hear it from you

If you have a love, love
For another man
Why don't you just tell me
And I know I can take it

And if, and if
You just don't think I can
Why don't you just write me a letter
And I know that I'll make it

I said, it's bad if you fell me, no no no
But it's not so bad if you tell me
So if you do anything I wouldn't want you to do now
I said, lord, let me hear it from you
Let me hear it from you

If you've done anything I wouldn't like
Why don't you tell me?
Why don't you tell me?
Tell me, what did you do last night?
Why don't you tell me?
Tell me
