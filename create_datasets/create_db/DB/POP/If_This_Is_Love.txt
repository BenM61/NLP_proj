When I was a young man
I guess you could say
I would hopefully smile at the start of each day
No girl was a stranger
Who'd sit by my side
But then I found the secret
That you cannot hide
Over and over
This story I tell
Caught by surprise
Sent right to hell
For love is a gamble but this is no bet
The more you give the less you get

This is love
This is love
This is love
I don't want no part of it
Get to the heart of it

The more I tried to find you
The more you got lost
I knew that I must have you
No matter the cost
But all this is over
I've thrown off those chains
You're looking at a man
Who's pulled in those reins
Over and over
I tried not to ring
But each time I called
I heard just one thing
Love is a gamble but this is no bet
The more you give the less you get
