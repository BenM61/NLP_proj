This room is like the belly of a ghost 
Swaying to the rhythm of a heart that is now lost 
So tell me that I'm wrong 
Tell me that tehre's a consequence 
Or do you still remember me alive 
Beating like a drum 

I had a lot to drink last night 
Now I'm feeling old 
Is there anything that I can buy 
That I have not sold 
So tell me that I'm gone 
From your state of mind 
Do you still remember me alive 
Do you still remember me alive 
Beating like a ... 

Drum that beats upon the floor 
A shadow underneath the door 
I don't want to shoot this gun 
But everything just stops 

Like the beat of a drum 

So tell me that I'm wrong 
Tekk ne that there's a consequence 
Or do you still remember me alive 
Beating like a drum
