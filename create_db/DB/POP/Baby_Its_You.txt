Can somebody explain to me
Why everybody is trying to be
Living like a celebrity
Doing what they see on MTV.
Ice is cool but I am looking for more, simple things is what my heart beats for. 

Cause its me 
I don't ask for much 
Baby 
Having you is enough

[Chorus]
You ain't got to buy nothing
It's not what I want
Baby it's You
We don't have to go nowhere
Its not what I want
Baby it's you
It's not for what you got 
Cause I know you got alot 
No matter what you do
You always gettin Hot
It's You,
It's You

It don't matter that your car is fly 
And your rims are spinning on the side and 
It don't matter where we go tonight 
Cause if I'm with you I'll be alright. 
That's cool but I'm lookin for more 
Its your love that my heart beats for.

Cause thats me 
Don't have to spend a dime 
Baby
I just want your time.

[Chorus]

Oooooh
Ooooo

[Chorus]
Yeah Yeah Yeaey Yeahey Ye Ye Yeay
