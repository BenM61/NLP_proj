You ask me to give up the hand of the girl I love
You tell me I'm not the man she's worthy of
But who are you to tell her who to love?
That's up to her, yes, and the Lord above
You better move on

Well, I know you can buy her fancy clothes and diamond rings
But I believe she's happy with me without those things
Still you beg me to set her free
But, my friend, that will never be
You better move on

I can't blame you for lovin' her
But can't you understand, man, she's my girl?
And I'm never gonna let her go
'Cause I love her so

I think you better go, now, I'm gettin' mighty mad
You ask me to give up the only love I've ever had
Maybe I would, oh, but I love her so
Never gonna let her go
You better move on (you better move on)
You better move on (you better move on)
You better move on (you better move on)
You better move on (you better move on)
You better move on (you better move on)
You better move on (you better move on)

You better move on
