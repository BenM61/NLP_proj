You already know that
I run this town, what?

Oh na na, oh na na

Oh na na, oh na na

I am the queen of the jungle
I walk in ready to rumble
Blow out my kiss, watch 'em tumble
Oh na na, oh na na
Every one knows that I got this
Know how to handle my business
Stackin' up all of my riches
Oh na na, oh na na

I run this town, what?

Oh na na, oh na na

I got the keys to the city
I gotta know, is you with me?
Back to your crib, common courtesy
Oh na na, oh na na
I'll take you somewhere that's popping
Ratchet or not, we ain't stopping
Chasing the beat 'til we drop in
Oh na na, oh na na

I run this town, what?
I run this town, what?
I run this town, what?
You already know that
I run this town, what?

Oh na na, oh na na

Oh na na, oh na na

I run this town, what?
I run this town, what?
I run this town, what?
You already know that

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
All you pretenders, should let it go
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
All you pretenders, should let it go

I run this town, what?
