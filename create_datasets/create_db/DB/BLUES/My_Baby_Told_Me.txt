My baby told me, says, "You don't want me no mo' "
My baby told me, says, "You don't want me no mo' "
Well, I'm tellin' you baby and I can't stand to see you go

But you woke up this mornin',
Packed ev'thing an' leave
I'm standin' there shaken,
Like a leaf upon a tree

My baby told me,
Says, "Ya don't want me no mo' "
Well I'm tellin' you baby
But I can't stand to see you go

You better get a hold to yourself, baby,
Hide an'close the door
Before you make your daddy pull,
Out his .44

You know you told me,
Says you don't want me no mo'
Well I'm tellin' you baby,
That I can't stand to see you go
