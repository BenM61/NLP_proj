You are gone to the highest bidder
Now you're with a man that is god's worst sinner
Well no, don't care about me
I am just the man who meant to set you free
I tried to
Make you a part of me
I even told you what would happen theoretically
There is this something that I need to know
Why am I the only one that lost it all

But every day and every time I turn around
Searching for a place
That I have left behind
And all I wanna believe
That you could bleed so

Burn with me
I'm just an empty shell
Another's friend
Transformed to someone else
Take your seat
I cast a spell
So you'll be less like you
And more like someone else

One's life is another's dream
What someone says a myth is one's normality
How can I
Believe there's another sun
Correct me if I'm wrong but I'm the chosen one

As night has taken what is left of day
And everything is like it's made of clay
I feel like I am the only one
Feeding my need to be reckoned as someone

And every day and every time I turn around
Searching for a sign so I can make a sound
But all I want is to flee, I wanna see you

Burn with me
I'm just an empty shell
Another's friend
Transformed to someone else
Take your seat
I cast a spell
So you'll be less like you
And more like someone else

Burn with me
I'm just an empty shell
Another's friend
Transformed to someone else
Take your seat
I cast a spell
So you'll be less like you
And more like someone else

Burn with me
I'm just an empty shell
Another's friend
Transformed to someone else
Take your seat
I cast a spell
So you'll be less like you
And more like someone else
