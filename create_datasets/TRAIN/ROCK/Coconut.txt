Brother bought a coconut, he bought it for a dime
Sister had another one, she trade it for a lime

She put the lime in the coconut and drank 'em both up
She put the lime in the coconut and drank 'em both up
She put the lime in the coconut and drank 'em both up
Then she called the doctor and woke him up, and said

Doctor
(Ain't there nothing I can take)
I say, 'doctor'
(To relieve my belly ache)

I say, 'doctor'
(Ain't there nothing I can take)
I say, 'doctor'
(To relieve my belly ache)

You put the lime in the coconut and drink 'em both up
You put the lime in the coconut and drink 'em both up
You put the lime in the coconut and drink 'em both together
You put the lime in the coconut and then you feel better

Brother had a cooler head, a belly filled with booze
Sister had a magic potion 'cause she understood

She put the lime in the coconut and mix 'em both up
She put the lime in the coconut and shake 'em both up
She put the lime in the coconut and drank 'em both up
Then she called the doctor, wake your ass up

Doctor
(Ain't there nothing I can take)
I say, 'doctor'
(To relieve my belly ache)

I say, 'doctor'
(Ain't there nothing I can take)
I say, 'doctor'
(To relieve my belly ache)

I say, 'doctor'
(Ain't there nothing I can take)
I say, 'doctor'
(To relieve my belly ache)

I say, 'doctor'
(Ain't there nothing I can take)
I say, 'doctor'
(To relieve my belly ache)

You put the lime in the coconut and drink 'em both up
You put the lime in the coconut and drink 'em both up
You put the lime in the coconut and drink 'em both together
You put the lime in the coconut and then you feel better
You put the lime in the coconut and drink 'em both up
You put the lime in the coconut and call my in the morning
