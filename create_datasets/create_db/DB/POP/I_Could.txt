I could pretend to love you
And be someone else for a while
Make you believe your the one that I want
Give you my heart in disguise

I could be all you've wanted
Make all your dreams come true, yeah
Surrender my love at the feet of your will
And live out your fantasy for you

And you would be happy
And I'd make you smile
And I'd go on living a lie

Do you really want to give your life to
Thinking you've found true love, when it hasn't found you?
Do you really want to give your life to
Thinking you've found true love, when it hasn't found you?

I could make you a promise
And be all you want me to be
Give you my hand as we walk down the aisle
So you could live happily

And you would be happy
And I'd make you smile
And I'd go on living a lie

Do you really want to give your life to
Thinking you've found true love, when it hasn't found you?
Do you really want to give your life to
Thinking you've found true love, when it hasn't found you?

'Cause this is not what I had planned
I hoped one day that you will understand
If I could take this heart I broke
And say I love you honey if I could

Do you really want to give your life to
Thinking you've found true love, when it hasn't found you?

I could be the one to hold you
I could be the one you need
But I could never be the one
To give you everything

I could be the one to hold you
And I could be the one you need
But I could never be the one
To give you everything

Do you really want to give your life to
Thinking you've found true love? Yeah
Do you really want to give your life to
Thinking you've found true love, when it hasn't found you?

Do you really want to give your life to
Thinking you've found true love, when it hasn't found you?
When it hasn't found you?
