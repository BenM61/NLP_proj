The situation is telling me 
I should believe all hope is lost
But from the looks of things
I should be crying
But because I know in whom I trust
My heart tells me to rejoice

Whatever you want
I got it
Whatever you need
I got it 
Its all in me
I got it
I got it 

Is life failing me
Times seem to be so hard
Everything crumbles in my face
One dollar short,one day late
Then I remember that maybe 
I just forgot to pray
And when I call on You
All You have to say

Whatever you want
I got it
Whatever you need
I got it 
Its all in me
I got it
I got it
