Everyday, everyday I have the blues 
Ooh everyday, everyday I have the blues 
When you see me worryin' baby, yeah it's you I hate to lose 

Whoa nobody loves me, nobody seems to care 
Whoa nobody loves me, nobody seems to care 
Well worries and trouble darling, babe you know I've had my share 

Everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday 
Everyday, everyday I have the blues 
When you see me worryin' baby, yeah it's you I hate to lose 

Whoa nobody loves me, nobody seems to care 
Whoa nobody loves me, nobody seems to care 
Well worries and trouble darling, babe you know I've had my share

I'm gonna pack my suitcase, move on down the line
I'm gonna pack my suitcase, move on down the line
Where there ain't nobody worryin', and there ain't nobody cryin'
