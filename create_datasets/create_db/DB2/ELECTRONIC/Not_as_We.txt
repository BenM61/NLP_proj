Reborn and shivering
Spat out on new terrain
Unsure unconvincing
This faint and shaky hour

Day one, day one
Start over again
Step one, step one
I'm barely making sense
For now I'm faking it
Till I'm pseudo making it
From scratch, begin again
But this time I as I and not as we

Gun shy and quivering
Timid without a hand
Feign brave with steel intent
Little and hardly here

Day one, day one
Start over again
Step one, step one
I'm barely making sense
For now I'm faking it
Till I'm pseudo making it
From scratch, begin again
But this time I as I and not as we

Eyes wet toward
Wide open frayed
If God's taking bets
I pray He wants to lose

Day one, day one
Start over again
Step one, step one
I'm barely making sense
For now I'm faking it
Till I'm pseudo making it
From scratch, begin again
But this time I as I and not as we
