Distant flickering, its greener scenery,
This weathers bringing it all back again.
Great adventures, faces and condensation,
I'm going outside and take it all in.

You say too late to start, got your heart in a headlock,
I don't believe any of it.
You say too late to start, with your heart in a headlock,
You know your better than this.

We're a different pair, just something out of step,
Throw a stranger an unexpected smile.
With big intention, still posted at your station
Always on about the day it should have flown.

You say too late to start, got your heart in a headlock,
I don't believe any of it.
You say too late to start, with your heart in a headlock,
You know your better than this.

Afraid to start, got your heart in a headlock,
I don't believe any of it.
You say too late to start, with your heart in a headlock,
You know your better than this.

I'm walking, you've been hiding,
And you look half dead half the time.
Monitoring you, like machines do,
You've still got it, I'm just keeping an eye

I've been walking, you've been hiding,
And you look half dead half the time.
Monitoring you, like machines do,
You've still got it, I'm just keeping an eye

You know you're better than this

Come back and start, got your heart in a headlock,
No I don't believe any of it.
You say too late to start, with your heart in a headlock,
You know your better than this.

Afraid to start, got your heart in a headlock,
I don't believe any of it.
You say too late to start, with your heart in a headlock,
You know your better than this.
