When I look at your face
I know what I'm feeling
Can't nobody tell me nothing
'Cause I know what I'm doing
'Bout to grab my coat
Put the keys in ignition
Can't tell you how long
I been wishing for this moment to

Uh uh uh, with you
I wanna uh uh uh, with you

When we're on the phone
Your giving me directions
Can't even hold the pen straight
Such anticipation
Hundred miles an hour (hour)
Can I go any faster?
Can't you tell how I've been waiting
How I've been waitin' for this moment to

Uh uh uh, with you
I wanna uh uh uh, with you

That I wanna uh uh uh, with you
I wanna uh uh uh, with you

In my head I can see it so clearly
Thinking about all the things I wanna do to you babe
Do to you babe
Right now (right now)
Feels like I've been waiting for a lifetime
To find someone that'll want as much as I want you (as I want you)
Right now

(You know just how much I you baby)
Uh uh uh with you
I wanna uh uh uh with you
Said I wanna uh uh uh with you
Uh uh uh with you
Uh uh uh with you
I wanna uh uh uh with you

I wanna uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
I wanna uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
Just let me uh uh uh uh-uh-uh-uh uh uh uh
I wanna uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
