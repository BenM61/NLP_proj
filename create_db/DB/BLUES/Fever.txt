When I get home from my job, 
I turn on my TV
But I can't keep my mind on the show
When I lay down at night, 
I don't get no sleep
So I turn on the radio
But lord, the only thing I hear 
Is you whisp'rin' in my ear
Them words that you used to say
Well now the days grow longer, 
My love grows stronger
And the fever gets worse every day
I got the fever for this girl

He's got the fever, oh he's got the fever, 
Nothing that a boy can do
When he's got the fever for a girl
He's got the fever, oh he's got the fever
Left this little boy blue

I can remember coming home, 
See you standing at the stove
With the dishes on the table, 
Dinner ready to go
Well maybe out to a movie show
Something that you like to see
Because you were my sun in the morning, 
You were my moon at night
When I think about you, makes me feel alright
Well now the days grow longer, 
The love just grows stronger
And the fever gets so bad at night

He's got the fever, oh he's got the fever, 
Nothing that a boy can do
When he's got the fever for a girl
He's got the fever, oh he's got the fever
Left this little boy blue
All right
