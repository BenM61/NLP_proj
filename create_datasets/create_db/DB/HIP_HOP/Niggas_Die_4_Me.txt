[Drag-On]
Uh, let's go
Whoo! Drag-on, baby

[DMX]
Come on

[Chorus: x2]
My niggas is the niggas that'll ride with me
My niggas is the niggas gettin' high with me
My niggas is the niggas that'll die with me
And we can get it on

[Drag-On]
Rigga niggas want to see the Dog nigga bite
But this kid Drag strike a light
F*ck five mics, my fire burn the wire
'Cause we the niggas that plug
Wrap 'em in the rug
Flames mini blowing on my hands like dust
Chicks want to slurp?
Ya guaranteed I'm a make 'em burp
Just push your teeth to the curve
And hum a word
Some nerve, cats think they can touch the torch
You don't know about my gun just for me to toss
F*ck with the cars
I don't care what kind of drop ya pushin'
I put my fifteen through your top and dump bullets
Yeah, I see y'all cowards like to wear vests
Well, I'm a aim a little higher, like for your neck
I puff lye
I'm a lift blunts till my arm look like Popeye
Till the day is bye bye
Till then, three hundred G fly by, rented
So foggy windows look tinted
We just be lookin' at your Roley, at them hot shows
So go 'head, boy, get drunk, pop that Mo'
Until I pull ya to the side
See the nine, kid?
And since you got that nice watch
You know what time it is
'Cause Drag's clock say 7:30
So sudden move and you gon' be left somewhere
Real dirty, dirty
Double R, a camp where it's all champs
And if y'all want to stop fire, open up a 'dant

[Chorus: x2]

Bet'cha niggas always wonder
Why Drag always spit fire?
Why y'all always pop shit
About how I burn niggas till they chocolate?
'Cause I'm the opposite of H2O, now ya know
Fix your wrinkled face
My iron press more than clothes
And girls, I love 'em when I meet 'em
Might eat 'em
But when they act up, it's like Turner Tina
Don't me get the burner
Catch me in the low key Pontiac Sun, sippin' Con-gac
Y'all know how that affects blacks
So you know I clash that
No way I'm a blow all these gats and crack stacks
I'm a lil' nigga so you know I run fast
But don't do much of it 
Do a lot of gun busting
'Cause when I let off a clip, I get a kick
Outta seeing niggas run eyes open, hoping they don't trip
Ya hear the echoes blocks away
Type of bricklayers that hear shots today
And give your blocks away
Run up on papi 
Hey, drop the yay
And if he don't stall
This world be popped tomorrow
Drag-On speaks with a stutter, but I rhyme well
So like a dead snitch, it's hard to tell
Dirty, dirty niggas, word
This is to my grimy, grimy niggas, word
This is to my RR niggas, word
Yeah, 'cause we double R niggas, ya heard?
(Come on)

[Chorus: x6]
