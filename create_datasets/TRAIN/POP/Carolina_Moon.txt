Carolina moon, keep shinin',
Shinin' for the one who waits for me
Carolina moon, I'm pinin',
Pinin' for the one who waits for me
How I'm hopin' tonight, you'll go,
Go to the right window
Scatter your light, say I'm alright, please do
Tell him that I'm blue and lonely
Dreamy Carolina moon
INSTRUMENTAL BRIDGE
How I'm hopin' tonight, you'll go,
Go to the right window
Scatter your light, say I'm alright, please do
Tell him that I'm blue and lonely
Dreamy Carolina moon
Dreamy Carolina moon
Carolina moon, keep shinin',
Shinin' for the one who waits for me
