You got to get up
If you want to get

I hate people that ain't movin' their shoes
And I hate everybody that I see not feelin' my groove
I like rhymes that be quick as we be takin' the bar
But I hate everybody that don't like electric guitars and I
Hate people who think they can dose up their medicine fuckin' with venom and I twista
Show them the force I'd like to see somebody talkin shit get turned up a corpse
Only model with the ones that got the wickedest drawers
Kick it with y'all

But I hate phony ass people
And I hate having no dro
And I hate bitchy-ass clubs that don't be having no bitches that break it down to the floor
And I hate when I can't help somebody
And I hate when I ain't got dough
And I hate everyone feeling twista and prodigy rockin' music party music control

You've got to get up
If you want to get off

Keep your eyes open
So I can stop you from blinking
Make you feel
Try to see what you're thinking
Through the hole in your dome while I'm holding my own
Get so cold in the zone I'm destroying my clone
I can fill the fucking room up with torture and pain
Lyrical is coursing my veins
It's the trilogy of terror
From my era
Agility that I scare ya because I hate ya'll
