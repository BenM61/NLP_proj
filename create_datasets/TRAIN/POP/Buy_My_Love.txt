Don't you hesitate to buy my love

I wanna spend your money,
Don't get me wrong.
Still gonna spend my money
I've got the funds.
Let's take a quick vacation,
A little shopping spree,
A fancy destination,
We'll spend it all on me

You could be my sugar daddy,
I call you my honey honey,
Blow the rent, the whole shebang on me
You know how to throw a party,
We can act like it's my birthday,
Lots of ways to make me smile

There's a million ways to show your devotion,
So many ways to sway my emotions
Ooh, ooh
Don't you hesitate to buy my love

Girls like chocolate, kisses, and roses,
We want jewels, gimme shoes, gimme romance,
Ooh, ooh.
Don't you hesitate to buy my love

I'm gonna let you spoil me, just for today.
Your time'll come I promise, you'll have your way.
No need to thank me baby, a credit card will do.
The love you show me, baby, is coming back to you.

You could be my sugar daddy,
I call you my honey honey,
Blow the rent the whole shebang on me
You know how to throw a party,
We can act like it's my birthday,
Lots of ways to make me smile.

There's a million ways to show your devotion,
So many ways to sway my emotions
Ooh, ooh
Don't you hesitate to buy my love

Love me, love me,
How much do you want me?
You can buy my love,
But you should try, try

There's a million ways to show your devotion,
So many ways to sway my emotions
Ooh, ooh
Don't you hesitate to buy my love

Girls like chocolate, kisses, and roses,
We want jewels, gimme shoes, gimme romance,
Ooh, ooh
Don't you hesitate to buy my love
