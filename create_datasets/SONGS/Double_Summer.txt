Dawn draws near, 
Time flies quitely,
Soft warm felt close by,
I lie here quite still,
It's a thrill.

She,
Who sleeps alongside,
A stranger last week,
Is part of my life,
I look at her with just one single sheaf of colour,
Sunlight playes above her,
Will she stay and share some double summer?
Live never tires of great surprises,
Love may have touched us here,
And summers in the air,
Everywhere.

She,
Seems very like me,
The longer we spoke
The more I could see,
If we were to join our forces
And combine resources,
We could share the summer,
And enjoy its deeper secrets,
Life never tires of great suprises,
Love may have touched us here, 
With something we can share

And some sometimes I hear distant thunder,
Troubles bubbling under,
And I start to wonder,
Maybe she will crack my concerns till they scatter like dust?
Not a thing in this world would be stronger than us.
If she said that she'd stay,
I forever would treasure her trust,
For that's enough.

But maybe these are flights of fancy,
When she wakes she'll leave me, 
But then I see her watching -
And she's smiling,
Life has the strangest way of saying:
Love will occur here now.

Here goes, double summer, 
Sharing with one another.
Here goes, double summer, 
Sharing with one another.

Here goes,
Here goes.
