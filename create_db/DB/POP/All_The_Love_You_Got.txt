I sit and wonder where you’re gone
Have you found a head to ground that stays under when you push it down?
I sit and ponder what went wrong
Was I too emotional?
Too many puzzles for your simple soul
Does she let you sleep
When she’s awake

Does she close her eyes and pay the asking price
Does she suffer with the smile
Take a penny for a song and it’s all
Part of loneliness drinks the honey of your promises
Does she know that’s all the love you got
That’s all the love you got
Does she know that’s all the love you got

And tell me does it feel the same
Is she close enough to hurt
When she takes it does it make it worse
Can you still kill a perfect day
With a twinkle in your eye
Do you still awake when she’s asleep

Does she close her eyes and pay the asking price
Does she suffer with the smile
Take a penny for a song and it’s all
Part of loneliness drinks the honey of your promises
Does she know that’s all the love you got
That’s all the love you got

When she let's you lead away
Does she want it when she’ll get there if you get there

Does she close her eyes and pay the asking price
Does she suffer with the smile
Take a penny for a song and it’s all
Part of loneliness drinks the honey of your promises
Does she know that’s all the love you got
That’s all the love you got
Does she know that’s all the love you got

All the love you got
Does she know that's all the love you got
That's all the love you got
Does she know that's all the love you got
That's all the love you got
