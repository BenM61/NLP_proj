Do you remember playing on the swings?
Doin' silly things that lovers do
Nothing else mattered but me and you
We'll be together for eternity, just you and me

I remember all those times
We spent in each other's arms
Why can't we try to do it all again?

And do you remember long talks on the phone?
We couldn't wait to be alone
And all the things we wrote were all so strong
And we'll never part, you hold the key to my heart

I remember times of yesterday
Why did they have to go away
Why can't we try to do it all again?

Memories of such happiness
And those times were the best
I love you, it's true
Won't you be my

My forever love
The only love I know, I'll never let you go, no
My forever love
Forever you will be a special part of me

Since we're together now
This empty space in my heart has been filled
Without you I don't think that I could deal
I'm head over heels in love with you, it's true

I remember times we shared
Girl, don't go nowhere
Why can't we try to do it all again?

Say you'll be mine, be mine forever
Always together
In love, in love
Please be mine, please be my

My forever love
The only love I know
I'll never, never, never
Never, never let you go

My forever love
Forever you will be
A special, special
Special part of me, baby

And I will love you, baby, I will love you, baby, yeah, yeah
You're the only love, the only love I need, I need, baby
Say you'll be here, be here for me
I want you to be the only one I run to
