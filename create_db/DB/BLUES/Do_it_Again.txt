You really shouldn't have done it
You hadn't any right
I really shouldn't have let you
Kiss me.
And although it was wrong
I never was strong.
So as long as you've begun it
And you know you shouldn't have done it.

Oh.
Do it again.
I may say no. no. no. no. no.
But do it again.
My lips just ache
To have you take the kiss
That's waiting for you
You know if you do
You won't regret it
Come and get it.

Oh.
No one is near
I may cry oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.
But no one can hear.
Mamma may scold me
'Cause she told me
It was naughty but then

Please,
Do it again.
Yes do it again. And again and again and again and again and again
Turn out the light.
And hold me close
In your arms
All through the night.
I know tomorrow morning
You will say
Goodbye and Amen.

But until then
Please do it again.
