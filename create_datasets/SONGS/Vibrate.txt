My phone's on vibrate for you
Electro clash is karaoke too
I try to dance Britney Spears
I guess I'm getting on in years

My phone's on vibrate for you
God knows what all these new drugs do
I guess to have no more fears
But still I always end up in tears
In tears, in tears

So call me
Call me in the morning
Call me in the night
So call me
Call me anytime you like

My phone's on vibrate for you
But still I never ever feel from you
Pinocchio's now a boy
Who wants to turn back into a toy
(To a toy)

So call me
Call me in the morning
Call me in the night
So call me
Call me anytime you like
