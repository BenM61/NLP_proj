Once, there were stars out in the night
That never seemed to shine
And love was there for every heart
Seemed every heart but mine

That's how it seemed to be
Then, darling, you changed everything
Just when I thought I'd given up
Out walked loneliness

In walked love, in walked you
In walked all my dreams a-coming true
In walked love, right through my door

I saw your face and I knew
All I looked for, I had found in you
I had found the one that I'd been dreaming of, oh
In walked love

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh

I tossed my heart into the wind
I had thrown all hope away
That love would ever let me in
And then, you came my way

Just like a ray of light
That breaks through the long, cold night
You brought in a brand new morning sun
Out walked loneliness

In walked love, in walked you
In walked all my dreams a-coming true
In walked love, right through my door

I saw your face and I knew
All I looked for, I had found in you
I had found the one that I'd been dreaming of, oh
In walked love

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh

And now, I feel
How it feels to feel alive
Just one touch and I knew
And I knew

In walked love, in walked you
In walked all my dreams a-coming true
In walked love, right through my door

Oh, I saw your face and I knew
All I looked for, I had found in you
I had found the one that I'd been dreaming of, oh
In walked love

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh

In walked love, in walked you
In walked all my dreams a-coming true
In walked love, in walked you
In walked all my dreams a-coming true
