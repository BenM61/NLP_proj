I've been to Colorado
Where the mountains touch the sky
And I've done other things in life

To lift my spirits high
But nothin' that I've ever tried to do
Has taken me as high as lovin' you

'cause you lift me up up up
Up to heaven
When you gently lay me down
You lift me up up up
Up to heaven
Yes you make my world go round

I never try to get away
On daydreams anymore
Love's taken me to places
That I've never been before

But if it's not heaven
When you're holdin' me
Then it's the way that heaven oughta be
'cause you lift me up
