When you laugh it just makes me cry
When you cry it just makes me smile
When you smile well that makes me mad
When you're mad it just makes me laugh
When you're high it just makes me low
When you're low it just picks me up
You feel up well that gets me down
When you're down it makes me feel high

And you never gave me anything but I ended up with less
Blame it on the bad actress
And I never asked for everything but I ended up a mess
Blame it on the bad actress

If you leave that means I'll stay
If you stay I'll just have to go
When you go then I'll have to wait
If you wait I'll just have to leave

And you never gave me anything but I ended up with less
Blame it on the bad actress
And I never asked for everything but I ended up a mess
Blame it on the bad actress

If I was to say anything you'd say the opposite
Maybe try to suggest something and just get torn to bits
We could both think up the same thing and you'd say say something else
We could not agree on one thing except for how it felt

And you never gave me anything but I ended up with less
Blame it on the bad actress
And I never asked for everything but I ended up a mess
Blame it on the bad actress

And you never gave me anything never gave me anything
Never gave me anything never gave me anything
Never gave me anything but I ended up a mess
Blame it on the bad actress
