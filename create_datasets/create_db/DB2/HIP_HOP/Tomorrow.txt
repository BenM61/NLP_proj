Oh, oh,
Oh, oh,

Visions in my head would lay,
All the plans I had delayed.
Tricks on me my mind will play
See you laying next to me

Wind that shakes the barley tree,
Kurt the only friend of me
He prepared me food and drinks
'Cause I will need all my strength.

Tomorrow, I'm finally coming home tomorrow.
I just gotta get through today,
But hey, what's one more day to wait
Tomorrow, you'll be back in my arms tomorrow,
I just gotta get through today,
But hey, what's one more day to wait.
(One more day)

I've been counting all the days,
(Hey) watching all the seasons change.
(Hey) and I no longer have to wait,
(Hey) 'cause I'm a see your pretty face.

I meet with this foolish shrink,
Tries to tell me what to think.
But I'm wiser than he know,
In one ear and out it goes.

How can they say you don't exist,
When I've been branded by your lips.
Nothing they can say or do,
Will stop me from seeing you.

Tomorrow, I'm finally coming home tomorrow.
I just gotta get through today,
But hey, what's one more day to wait
Tomorrow, you'll be back in my arms tomorrow,
I just gotta get through today,
But hey, what's one more day to wait.
(One more day)

I've been counting all the days.
Watching all the seasons change
And I no longer have to wait,
'Cause I'mma see your pretty face

Tomorrow, I'm finally coming home tomorrow.
I just gotta get through today,
But hey, what's one more day to wait
(One more day)

Tomorrow, you'll be back in my arms tomorrow,
I just gotta get through today,
But hey, what's one more day to wait.

Oh, oh,
Oh, oh,
Oh, oh,
Oh, oh
