C'mon everybody open
Up your windows
Turn on the music
Turn on the music

when I feel that this old world
Is just to hard to bear
People comin' at me left and right
Day and night
Here's the thing I do

turn the radio up
Hear the melody
Turn reality down
There's too much talk about blues
Too much of the time
Turn the radio up
Hear the harmony
Turn the negative down
Turn the radio up
Everything will be fine

worryin' don't do no good
So throw your cares away
Come on people life's too
Short to stay
Hey hey
Everybody now

turn the radio up
Hear the melody
Play it all over town
There's to much talk about blues
Turn the bulletins down
Turn the radio up
Hear the harmony
Don't 'cha be so profound
Turn the radio up
It'll turn you around

don't give in
No matter what they say
Out with the negative
You find the positive way
Hey, hey, hey

turn the radio up
Up with harmony
Pandemonium down
There's to much talk about blues
All over this town
Hey, hey, hey

turn the radio up
Hear the melody
Don't you be so profound
Turn the radio up
It'll turn you around

turn the radio up
Turn the radio up
Turn the radio up
