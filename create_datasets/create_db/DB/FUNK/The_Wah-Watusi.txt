Wah-wah-a-watusi
See'mon and take a chance and get-a with this dance 
Wah-wah-a-watusi
Oh baby, it's the dance made for romance (shoo-bop, shoo-bop, ahh)
Baby, baby, when you do the twist
Never, never do you get yourself kissed
'Cause you're always dancing far apart
Watusi girl is-a really smart 
Wah-a-wah, wah-a-watusi
See'mon and take a chance and get-a with this dance (shoo-bop, shoo-bop, ahh)
Baby, when you do the fly, your arms are wasting waving in the sky
See'mon and hold me like a lover should 
The watusi makes you feel so good
Wah-a-wah, wah-a-watusi
Oh baby, it's the dance made for romance 
Yea! (Shoo-bop, shoo-bop, ahh)
Baby, baby, that's the way it goes
Nothing happens when you mash potatoes
I just gotta fall in love with you
Watusi is the dance to do
Wah-a-wah, wah-a-watusi
See'mon and take a chance and get-a with this dance
Wah, wah-a Watusi
Oh baby, it's the dance made for romance
