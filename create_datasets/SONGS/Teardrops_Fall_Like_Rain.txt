I'm not sure if I love you
But every time you say we're through
I feel the pain and tear drops fall like rain

When you're around
I never know how I feel but when you go
I feel the pain and tear drops fall like rain

Time for me to make my decision
You can help me decide
Wish you knew what I've been through
And all those teardrops I've dried (Cried)

Let me know if you love me
That's the way it's got to be
Can't stand the pain and tears that fall like rain
 
Time for me to make my decision
You can help me decide
Wish you knew what I've been through
And all those teardrops I've dried (Cried)

Let me know if you love me
That's the way it's got to be
Can't stand the pain and tears that fall like rain
