Like the day looks forward to the rising sun
Like the sun that everyday kiss the tide
Like the bridges that leads you to the other side
I'm everyday thankful that you're the one

If you chased me baby I'd be still as stone
Cause babe you bring my smile on like no other
There ain't no deeper feeling I get nowhere than
When I'm the skin beneath your hands

You're some kind of beautiful in my life

I don't need to hide my willingness
To revel at the beauty that you possess
Like every grain of sand that rolls with the sea
Just like heaven you and Ii will forever be

You're some kind of beautiful in my life
