This is the last time I see your smile 
And it feels like heaven, so divine 
Of course you wonder, wonder why 
So make it look good then decide 
No tin cans tied back of car 
Is that the way the story end completely? 
'Cause I sure ain't happy girl 
Just because we say bitter sweetly 
We're outta luck and outta time 
Out of money, now I count in dimes 
Of course you wonder, wonder why 
So make it look good then decide 

And I know 
I'll make it look good 
And force a smile 
Smile 

'Cause there's a new way out you see 
No sweet reunion, no sweet relief 
Of course you wonder, wonder why 
So make it look good then decide 

And I know 
I'll make it look good 
And force a smile 
Smile 

I grind my teeth, bite my tongue 
Look at what we've become it's 
Got me feeling so low 
Got me feeling low 

I'll make it look good 
And force a smile 
Smile 

Oh you blacken my thumb
