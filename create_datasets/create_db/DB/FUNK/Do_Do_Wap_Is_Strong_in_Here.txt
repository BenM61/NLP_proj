Do do wap is strong in here
Do do wap is strong in here

Do do wap to find yourself creamin'
Check your fears and hope that you're dreamin'
A little space is all that I need
If these suckers just allow me to breathe

My woman's candy makin' him sick
When I cop there won't be nothin' to lick
Give her some of all the hard, hard pain
Make her achin' body call for my name

My woman know my passion of needs
So save some of mine if you please
Got to give it up, don't desert
If you leave me, babe, know you would hurt, hey

Do do wap is strong in here
Do do wap is strong in here
Do do wap is strong in here
Do do wap is strong in here

Wakin' up to find yourself creamin'
Check your fears and hope that you're dreamin'
A little space is all that I need
If these suckers just allow me to breathe

Snake pits and Lucifers burns
Can't take the strength I've earned and learned
Stepped in depth of the same livin' hell
Ain't too proud to die here as well

Do do wap is strong in here
Do do wap is strong
Do do wap, hey, hey

Do do wap strong in here, hey, hey
Do do wap, hey, hey
Do do wap, hey, hey

Do do wap is strong in here
Do do wap is strong
Do do wap, hey, hey

Do do wap is strong in here
Do do wap is strong
Do do wap, hey, hey

Do do wap is strong in here
Do do wap is strong
Do do wap, do do wap, do do wap
