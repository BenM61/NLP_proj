Girl you know we belong together
I don't have no time for you to be playing with my heart like this
You'll be mine forever baby, you just see

We belong together
And you know that I'm right
Why do you play with my heart
Why do you play with my mind
Said we'd be forever
Said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me and never
Say good-bye

When I can't sleep at night without holding you tight
Girl, each time I try I just break down and cry
Pain in my head oh I'd rather be dead
Spinnin' around and around

Although we've come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you
Come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you

[Chorus]
Girl, I know you really love me
You just don't realize
You've never been there before
It's only your first time
Maybe I'll forgive you
Maybe you'll try
We should be happy together forever
You and I

Can you love me again like you loved me before
This time I want you to love me much more
This time instead just come to my bed
And baby just don't let me down

Girl I'm here for you
All those times of night when you just hurt me
And just ran out with that other fella
Baby I knew about it, I just didn't care
You just don't understand how much I love you do you?
I'm here for you
I'm not out to go out and cheat on you all night
Just like you did baby but that's all right
Hey, I love you anyway
And I'm still gonna be here for you 'till my dying day baby
Right now, I'm just in so much pain baby
Cause you just won't come back to me
Will you? just come back to me

(lonely)
Yes baby my heart is lonely
(lonely)
My heart hurts baby
(lonely)
I'm feel pain too
Baby please

This time instead just come to my bed
And baby just don't let me down

[Chorus:Repeat x2]
