You fashion people in your camouflage wear 
You think you're really quite up there 
But the fashions you wear aren't so cool 
You really should go back, you're old school 
And Martin hides behind our stripes 
The T-shirts yeah! that's what she likes 
Nicking off with logos at cartier 
The grand mister D, or Charly, some say 

Fashion! 

Dress-up dummies for a little while 
Crashed the crash party in real chicks style 
Karl and his lens they like to watch 
King of the thing 
But we don't give a f*ck 
Gucci's got the monopoly 
Fifty handbags - that's victim's luxury 
Voguefied in 01, enough of that fake, it's said and done 

Fashion is for fashion people 
It's hard to be cool if you don't follow these rules 
Fashion is for fashion people 
Get out there now and break the rules 

Fashion is for fashion people 
It's hard to be cool if you don't follow these rules 
Fashion is for fashion people 
Get out there now and break the rules 

Fashion! 

Bless your dress, you're out of style 
You're a brainwash victim for a while 
Off with their heads is what we say 
After marie antoinette it's the only way 

You're a model and you walk the beat 
They even told you what to eat 
Bacteria inbred in fashion schools 
Get out there now and break the rules 

Fashion is for fashion people 
It's hard to be cool if you don't follow these rules 
Fashion is for fashion people 
Get out there now and break the rules 

It's hard
