Down in the Mexicali
There's a crazy little place that I know
Where the drinks are hotter than the chili sauce
And the boss is a cat named Joe

He wears a red bandana, plays a blues pi-anna
(In a honky-tonk, down in Mexico)
He wears a purple sash, and a black moustache
(In a honky-tonk, down in Mexico)

Well, the first time that I saw him
He was sittin' on a piano stool
I said "a-tell me dad, when does the fun begin?"
He just winked his eye and said "man, be cool"

He wears a red bandana, plays a blues p-ianna
(In a honky-tonk, down in Mexico)
He wears a purple sash, and a black moustache
(In a honky-tonk, down in Mexico, in Mexico)

All of a sudden in walks this chick (in Mexico)
Joe starts playing on a Latin kick (in Mexico)
Around her waist she wore three fishnets (in Mexico)
She started dancin' with the castanets (in Mexico)
I didn't know just what to expect (in Mexico)
She threw her arms around my neck (in Mexico)
We started dancin' all around the floor
And then she did a dance I never saw before

So if you're south of the border
I mean down in a-Mexico
And you want to get straight, man
Don't hesitate
Just look up a cat named Joe

He wears a red bandana, plays a blues pi-anna
(In a honky-tonk, down in Mexico)
He wears a purple sash, and a black moustache
(In a honky-tonk, down in Mexico)
