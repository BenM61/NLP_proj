Don't you know I love you
Little darling?
Want the world to know now
Little darling.
Can't live without your precious love
Can't do without it any more
Little darling
Ah
Little darling.
Put your arms around me
Little darling
Tell me that you want me
Little darling.
Can't live without your precious love

Little darling
You showed me how
Gave me true loving now
So don't let's change it
Or rearrange it
Ah.
Don't you know I love you
Little darling

Can't live without your precious love

Little darling be mine say you'll love me
Always forever for all time
Ooh.
Put your arms around me
Little darling
