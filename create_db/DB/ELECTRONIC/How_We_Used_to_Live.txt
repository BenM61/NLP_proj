A rose scented June
A rose he pulled in June
They're full upon the lawn
The doctor came at dawn

An old daily care
And Suzie Banana stare
Through frosted windowpane
Your father's middle name
From a train
And everywhere the snow falls
Sail away 
Sail away
Sail away
Sail away

A pale, faded blue
A Ruben's oaker view
One windy winter's day
A Windsor market day
People say
Everywhere the snow falls
Sail away 
Sail away
Sail away
Sail away
Sail away
Sail away
Sail away
Sail away

She's moving down the seaside
'Cause that's where he comes from
He gave away all of her records
Is that where she belongs?

Better think it through
Remember who
Is there something new?
Or is it you again?

Sail away
Sail away
Sail away

Sail away
Sail away
Sail away

Sail away
Sail away
Sail away

Sail away
Sail away
Sail away 

So take your red gown
And go down to the dam
To do as you please
On the streets of your town

The whistling kind
Shake it out of your mind
It could be the day
When you finally say
Sail away
Sail away

Sail away
Sail away
Sail away

Sailing on 
On and on 
On and on 

On and on
On and on
On and on

On and on
Up the riverbank, land that dried up
The causeway full of nice cars
The sound of a distant train

Across the eastern riverbank
Cross the riverbank, don't look back

To sail away
And on and on
To sail away
And on and on
(To sail away)
(And on and on)

I sail, you sail
I sail, you sail
Do you remember how? 
Do you remember how?
Do you remember how?
Do you remember how?

Do you remember how we used to live? 
Do you remember how we used to live?
Do you remember how we used to live?
