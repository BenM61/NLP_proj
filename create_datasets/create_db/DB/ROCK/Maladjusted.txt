Nothing satisfies, nothing will cause it won't get a chance to.
Altered spirit and altered mind take a turn for the worst soon.
Fear has struck, fear is stuck maladjusted

Assurance won't sit well at all cause no one is trusted
You've got what you wanted
The reason you came
Control action control of the game

See through the happiness,
See through the sappiness
Seen through the front that obscures all the truth
And see ugliness, torture, torture and ugliness

Selfishness lost in a quagmire of human filth
Fear has struck, fear is stuck Maladjusted
Fear that rules a twisted f*ck, Maladjusted
