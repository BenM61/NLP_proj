I don't know your face no more
Or feel the touch that I adore
I don't know your face no more
It's just a place I'm looking for

We might as well be strangers in another town
We might as well be living in a different world
We might as well
We might as well
We might as well

I don't know your thoughts these days
We're strangers in an empty space
I don't understand your heart
It's easier to be apart

We might as well be strangers in another town
We might as well be living in another town
We might as well
We might as well
We might as well be strangers
Be strangers

For all I know of you now
For all I know of you now
For all I know of you now
For all I know
