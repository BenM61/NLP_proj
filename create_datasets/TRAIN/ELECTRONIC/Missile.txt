So you came like a missile
Falling on my head with the black sky
Think you're giving but you're taking my life away

Then you came with your breeze blocks
Smashing up my face like a bus stop
Think you're giving but you're taking my life away

Like the drunk you convinced was sober
You keep me falling over
(In the daylight)
Think you're giving but you're taking my life away

With the best of intentions
You tried to give an ocean direction
Think you're giving but you're taking my life away

So you came like a missile
Leaving me the whole world in exile
Think you're giving but you're taking my life away

Like the drunk you convinced was sober
You keep me falling over
(In the daylight)
Think you're giving but you're taking my life away
Think you're giving but you're taking my life away
