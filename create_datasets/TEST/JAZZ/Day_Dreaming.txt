I got vampire tendencies
Biting your neck
Sweat dripping down
While your hands on my chest
But I love it
And she love it too
Stars on my roof
We parked up on Mulholland
Tell you the truth
Girl, I think that I'm falling
But I love it
And you love it too

So pour up another drink now
'Cause I don't really wanna think
I just want you on me now
So I can feel your heartbeat
Kiss me underneath the moonrise
Shotgun in the Jeep
It's paradise, it's just you and me
'Cause I'm

Daydreaming, dreaming
Yeah I'm daydreaming
Dreaming with you

Late weekends
Daydreaming
They all want you
For the same reason
But me I'm in it for the long haul girl
I want ya 'til you ain't breathing
Until you ain't breathing
I hit it from the back
Stay screaming
Like oh
And I don't even sing
But you make me wanna do things I don't do
It's true I'm like
Hm, hm, hm, hm got me singing like
Hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm

So pour up another drink now
'Cause I don't really wanna think (I don't)
I just want you on me now
So I can feel your heartbeat
Kiss me underneath the moonrise
Shotgun in the Jeep (in my Jeep)
In paradise, we don't need sleep
'Cause I'm

Daydreaming, dreaming
Yeah I'm daydreaming
Dreaming with you
(When i'm with you, uh uh)

Oh I love it
And she love it too
So we love it
It's a dream come true
We're lovin'
It feels so brand new
It's paradise here
In this room
'Cause I

I'm dreaming, dreaming when I'm with you
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm dreaming, dreaming when I'm with you
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
When I'm with you
