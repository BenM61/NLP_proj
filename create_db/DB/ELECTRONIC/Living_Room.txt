You can see in miniature, everything is so small
Close to the ground, you have found
There's no need to worry at all

We could go to the cinema
Where everything would be so tall
But you hang around the man
That you've seen around town

There's nothing to do
Since you broke up from school

We could go into the cinema
Where everything would be so tall
But you hang around the man
You've seen around town

There's nothing to do
Since you broke up from school
Ah, ah, ah
