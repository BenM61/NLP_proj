It was all a dream yeah homey I am on my job
And you can't take that away from me (can't take that away)
Yeah I got my team and I got all of my niggas behind me (C-T-E nigga)

I'm so sick and tired of being sick and tired

I am absolutely positively on my grizzy
Even though I'm sick and I'm tired I gets busy
Started a 62 but it ended up a Frisbee
And me I like to sit at the stove until I'm dizzy
Ball so hard it's like I brought the game with me
Left my glove so white you thought I brought Jermaine with me
Bout to paint a perfect picture like I brought the frame with me
(I'm fed up, I'm fed up)
I give it all up before I let the fame get me
I got niggas tryna sue me bitches tryna do me
Way these niggas actin' you'd a thought they never knew me
But these niggas know me and half them niggas owe me
I'm fed up probably why I'm actin' like the old me

Somebody catch the chain I'm bout to tear his head off
Shorty bendin' over know I'm bout to tear it up
Before you let your top back get your bread up
Made history but now we claimin' victory
Get ya out the white house go back to your efficiencies (suckas)
Suckas feel me and I know you haters hear me
(I'm fed up, I'm fed up)
Like I-R-S you wonderin' what I'm makin' yearly
Let them brown bags circulate (stack) so I perpetrate (never)

Lookin' at the parking lot better get your mind right

He leaned over and told me just don't retire on 'em
And when they give ya they shoulders never cry on 'em
And when they love you to death just never die on 'em
And the question still remains
Have I counted all the money that I've managed to obtain?
Niggas dedicating overtime to damaging my name
And somehow I'm still the hottest mufucka' in the game

(I'm happy to be back man)
I'm tired of these haters
That's why I go hard like A.C. Slater
Weezy Baby here, y'all prenatal

Uh I'm sick of being criticized
That's why I'm higher than a Star Trek enterprise
I do it big don't get mad cause you minimized
I keep a red flag case I get penalized, uh
Its young money like you didn't know
Stop playing I hit Drizzy with the give and go
It was all a dream, now we the dream team
Who trying to see us? You seeing things

Got a chest full of heart no tin man
