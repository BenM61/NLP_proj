I gave you the tide
You didn't stay
You didn't want it
You let the day slide
Into a drain
Until you lost it

You took me like a drug
To make you feel loved
To make you feel wanted
To make you feel fire
To make you feel like
I made you feel something
'Cause you can feel nothing

I know what you are (I know what you are)
And you're a fake
You're a scavenger (scavenger)
Too scared to take part (too scared to take part)
You only take
'Cause you're a coward (coward, coward)

On your own
You have no love
On your own
You're nothing at all

You took me like a drug
To make you feel loved
To make you feel wanted
To make you feel fire
To make you feel like
I made you feel something
'Cause you can feel nothing
