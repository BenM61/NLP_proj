What a beautiful day
We swin in deep waters
And get lost on the way

There ain't much to say
Out here in nowhere
On a day like today
We drift far away
All away

Cause I found love, a love like tides
A love that moves, a love that guides
Yes I found love, a love like seas
A love that stays, come with me, please
I won't let go, whether it's high or low

What a beautiful day
We drown in deep waters
On day like today
We drift far away
All away

Cause I found love, a love like tides
A love that moves, but never hides
Yes I found love, a love like seas
A love that stays, stay with me, please
I won't let go, whether it's high or low
Oh no no, won't let go, whether it's fast or slow
Oh no no, I won't let you go
I won't let you go
