Feeling like we're worlds away
Won't be long
Distance only separates
Same old song

On my way home, saddest thing she said
On the night when she went away from me
On my way home, saddest thing she said
On the night when she went away from me

Every time you went away
I always knew
Feels like murder one today
Sad but true

On my way home, saddest thing she said
On the night when she went away from me
On my way home, saddest thing she said
On the night when she went away from me

You'll never make me whole
You'll never make me change
You'll never make me sing
You'll never feel the same
You'll never feel the same

On my way home, saddest thing she said
On the night when she went away from me
On my way home, saddest thing she said
On the night when she went away from me
