I gave my hand for you to hold
I gave my love that you went and sold
Exchanged our song for another
Can't blame, is that flame that once glowed like no other.

How do you soften the thought of carrying coffins?
We were so alive
Only to see us wither and die.

You say you stand even if this is our fault
You're earning, you'll dare when you will hit the wall
I shot your ears, tried to make you hear my call
But you were long gone, hoping this song is done.

How do you soften the thought of carrying coffins?
We were so alive
Only to see us wither and die.

I saw your hand dry
And I never ever thought I'd hear these words be said
Now I lay here in an unmade bed
Empty stomach, Sunday bowl to be fed
Your ego swallowed and from there you fled
So far away, could not find your way back
Walked down the path, wet feet slip through the grass.

Wet feet slip through the grass
Could not find your way back
Wet feet slip through the grass
Could not find your way back.

How do you soften the thought of carrying coffins?
We were so alive
Only to see us wither and die.

Oh, why? I saw your hand dry.
