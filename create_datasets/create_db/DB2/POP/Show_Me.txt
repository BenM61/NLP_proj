Since I've been away, I've heard a lot of people say
They tell me that you've been playing around
It just can't be true, the things they say you do
But baby, I just gotta know for sure

You gotta show me that you've been true
Show me, nobody else will do
Tell me things will be the way they used to be
Show me, show me

They all say, that put me down
I don't think you'll ever roam around
Would you break me down
Would you play around

Show me, we'll never have to part
Show me, you'll never break my heart
Tell me things will be the way they used to be
Show me, show me

You gotta show me that you're always true
Show me, nobody else will do
Tell me things will be the way they used to be
Show me, show me

You gotta show me that you're always true
Show me, nobody else will do
Tell me, things will be the way they used to be
Show me, show me

Tell me, you'll never break my heart
Show me, we'll never have to part
Tell me, things will be the way they used to be
Show me, show me

Tell me that you're always true
Show me, nobody else will do
Tell me, things will be the way they used to be
Show me, show me
