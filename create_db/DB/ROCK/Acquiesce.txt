I don't know what it is that makes me feel alive
I don't know how to wake the things that sleep inside
I only want to see the light that shines behind your eyes
I hope that I can say the things I wish I'd said
To sing my soul to sleep and take me back to bed
You want to be alone when we could be alive instead

Because we need each other
We believe in one another
I know we're going to uncover
What's sleepin' in our soul
Because we need each other
We believe in one another
(and) in know we're going to uncover
What's sleepin' in our soul
What's sleepin' in our soul

There are many things that I would like to know
And there are many places that I wish to go
But everything's depending on the way the wind may blow
I don't know what it is that makes me feel alive
I don't know how to wake the things that sleep inside
I only want to see the light that shines behind your eyes

Because we need each other
We believe in one another
I know we're going to uncover
What's sleepin' in our soul
Because we need each other
We believe in one another
(and) in know we're going to uncover
What's sleepin' in our soul
What's sleepin' in our soul

What's sleepin' in our soul
What's sleepin' in our soul
'cause we believe
