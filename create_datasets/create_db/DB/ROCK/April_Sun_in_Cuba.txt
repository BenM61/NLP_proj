I'm tired of the city life
Summer's on the run
People tell me I should stay
But I got to get my fun
So don't try to hold me back
Ain't nothing you can say
Snake eyes on the paradise
And we got to go today

Take me to the April Sun in Cuba, oh, oh, oh
Take me where the April sun gonna treat me so right
So right
So right

I can almost smell the perfumed nighs
And see the starry sky
I wish you comin' with me baby
'Cause right before my eye
See Castro in the alley way
Talkin' 'bout missile love
Talkin' 'bout J.F.K.
And the way he shook him up

Take me to the April Sun in Cuba, oh, oh, oh
Take me where the April sun gonna treat me So right
so right
So right

I'm tired of the city life
Summer's on the run
Birds in the winter sky
Are headin' for the sun
Oh, we can stick it out
In this cold and grey
Snake eyes on the paradise
And we got to go today, yeah

Take me to the April Sun in Cuba, oh, oh, oh
Take me where the April sun gonna treat me so right
So right
So right

Take me to the April sun
C'mon take me, take me to the April sun
C'mon, c'mon take me, take me to the April sun
C'mon, c'mon take me, take me to the April sun
