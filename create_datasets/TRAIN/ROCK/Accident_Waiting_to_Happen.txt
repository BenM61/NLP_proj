I've always been impressed with a girl
Who could sing for her supper and get breakfast as well
That's the way I am, heaven help me
He said, we don't like peace campaigners 'round here
As he nailed another one to the wall
And that's what gets me in trouble, heaven help me

Goodbye and good luck to all the promises you've broken
Goodbye and good luck to all the rubbish that you've spoken
Your life has lost it's dignity, it's beauty and it's passion
You're an accident waiting to happen

There you are standing at the bar
And you're giving me grief about the D-D-R
And that chip on your shoulder gets bigger as you get older
One of these night you're gonna get caught,
It'll give you a pregnant pause for thought
You're a dedicated swallower of fascism

Time up and time out for all the liberties you've taken
Time up and time out for all the friends that you've forsaken
And if you choose to waste away like death is back in fashion
You're an accident waiting to happen

And my sins are so unoriginal
I have all the self-loathing of a wolf in sheep's clothing
In this carnival of carnivores,
Heaven help me

Goodbye and good luck to all the promises you've broken
Goodbye and good luck to all the rubbish that you've spoken
Your life has lost it's dignity, it's beauty and it's passion
You're an accident waiting to happen
You're an accident waiting to happen
You're a dedicated swallower of fascism
You're an accident waiting to happen
