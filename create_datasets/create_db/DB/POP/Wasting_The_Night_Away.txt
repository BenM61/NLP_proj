Can you see it in the river
Can you find it in my eyes
When the devil take me over
It will come as no surprise
Yes, there's no time to fight
As we're wastin' the night away
Yes, there's no time to fight
We're wastin' the night away, hey

Give me time in this confusion
When I seem to lose control
Now I break through this illusion
Let it be, let it roll
And there's no time to fight
As we're wastin' the night away
Yes, there's no time to fight
As we're wastin' the night away

Yes, there's no time to fight
As we're wastin' the night away
Give me time in this confusion
When I seem to lose control
Now I break through this illusion
Let it be, let it roll
Cause there's no time to fight
As we're wastin' the night away
Yes, there's no time to fight
As we're wastin' the night away

Yes, there's no time to fight
As we're wastin' the night away
Yes, there's no time to fight
As we're wastin' the night away
