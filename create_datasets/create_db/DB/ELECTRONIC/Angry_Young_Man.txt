I, I tell you now the summer's dry
I sweat my brow and wipe my hair when I do
I could wear a shirt and tie everyday
The diamond eyes are not the treasure they say
Where's the "Catcher in the Rye" anyway
O the tragedy
Young rebels in their glory - misunderstood
Such a calamity
It's obvious the babes do steal the wood
Another angry young man they say
So sad that he lost his way
Another angry young man they say
O the youth how they drift away
I, I tell you now the summer's high
The forward cast of windswept dreams in the air
I will run close to the edge - every time
Between the wedge there lies a passion that's born
I said a passion that's born - born
O the tragedy
Of unsung heroes searching for their cause
Such a calamity
The unrequited rebel without applause
Another angry young man they say
So sad that he lost his way
Another angry young man they say
O the youth how they drift away
O the tragedy
Young rebels in their glory - misunderstood
Such a calamity
It's obvious the babes do steal the wood
Another angry young man they say
So sad that he lost his way
Another angry young man they say
O the youth how they drift away, say
Another angry young man they say
I, I tell you now the summer's dry
I tell you now the summer's dry.
SONG:
GOIN' HOME
They can never take what's in your soul
And they can never break what keeps you whole
When the rain comes down, yea, yea, yea
And they may criticize the way you are
When they patronize the dreams you keep so far inside
I will go to where I feel the light, yea
I'm goin' home, o, yea
I'm goin' home, now
I'm goin' home, I cry
I'm goin' home now, o no
O no
Can you count the days that have left you dry
And can you count the ways you ask yourself why
You carry on, yea, yea, yea
And you can justify all you do
But when you look around and find you're alone
Tell me where can you turn to
I will go to where I feel the light, o yea
I'm goin' home, o yea
I'm goin' home now, yea I said
I'm goin' home, I cried
I'm goin' home now, o no
For the memories will keep me strong
'Cause you can never forget from where you still belong
For the times I'm lost when I look around
I know I'll always be heading northward bound, yea
I'm goin' home, I say
I'm goin' home now, o no
Here we go
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Yea goin' home, I cried now
I'm goin' home
Goin' home, no
I'm goin' home, o no
They can never take what's in your soul
And they can never break what keeps you whole, o no
I want to go home
