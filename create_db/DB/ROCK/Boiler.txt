Looks like I'm 'a do everything myself 
Maybe I could use some help 
But hell, you want something done right 
You gotta do it yourself 
Maybe life is up and down 
But, my life's been what to now? 
I crawled up your butt from hell 
And that's when things got turned around 

It used to be a lie 
And now it feels pathetic 
And now I get it 
What's done is done 
You just leave it alone 
And don't regret it 
Sometimes some things turn into dumb things 
And that's when you put your foot down 

Why did I have to go and meet somebody like you? (like you) 
Why do you have to go and hurt somebody like me? (like me) 
How could you do somebody like that 
You know that I'm never coming back

Maybe life is up and down

Got it? 
I crawled up your butt somehow 
Got it?

Depending on you is done (is done) 
Giving to you is done 
No more eating, no sleeping, no living 
It's all just what giving to you and I'm done (and I'm done) 

But hiding from you is done (is done) 
But lying from you is done 
No more eating, no sleeping, no living 
It's all just what giving to you and I'm done (and I'm done)

Why? 

Ladies, gentlemen 
What you are experiencing 
Is in fact an inner lie man 
I would like you to kick back 
And think about everything you've just heard
