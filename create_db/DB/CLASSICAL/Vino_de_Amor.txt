Vino de Amor from the magical vine
Once you've taken a sip of that sweet summer wine
You'll be lost in its spell
Then I know you'll be mine
So let's drink to el vino de amor

Vino de amor and the taste of your lips
Leave a heavenly glow when I've stolen a kiss
It's a moment in time like a total eclipse
So let's drink to el vino de amor

As evening falls you are here in my arms
And the sound of the sea's like a million guitars
We'll lie beneath the blanket of stars
And we'll drink el vino de amor

We've tasted love on a warm starry nights
As I look in your eyes in the soft morning light
No I'll never forget such a beautiful sight
Here's a toast to el vino de amor
