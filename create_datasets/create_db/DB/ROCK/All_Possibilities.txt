All possibilities
Are landing at my feet
There's nothing I can see
But possibilities

All colors are changing in my eyes
Your hopes are all fading, that will never do
You're seeing the world through cynical eyes
I'm seeing the world through the eyes of somebody new

Oh, there's a hope left
There's a dream still in my heart
Love has the answers
There's a chance that there's no rulebook for this love
