I've been so unlucky
I'm no good at playing games
I remember their faces
Forget their names

Thought I found the right one
But she hasn't found me
So I bundle up my emotions and start

Looking for the right one
But will the right one ever come along
I'm looking for the right one
When will the right one come along

They say there's no use running
After something
You'll never get

But my heart says don't say no
Somewhere in this lonely city
Is the woman for me
But will I wait another lifetime to keep on


They say love always comes and goes
Well, that I already know
Yes I really know
