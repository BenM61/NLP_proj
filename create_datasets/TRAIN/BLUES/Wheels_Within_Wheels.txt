If you keep on walkin'
You'll walk right outta sight
And if you keep your eyes closed
You will not see the light

Just give me a chance
To put it right

If you keep your heart closed
You'll live out in the cold
And you'll go on searchin'
Such a lonesome road

Let me be the one
You wanna hold, yeah

Wheels within wheels
Confused what you feel a little bit
Rules within rules
Won't hide the hurt I have felt

Well, I could keep on tryin'
Looks like it's all been in vain
For somethin's truly got you
It's carryin' you away

Don't leave me standing
In this empty space
