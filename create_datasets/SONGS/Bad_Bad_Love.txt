It was all colors and heat,
And rain falling in the streets,
And bad, bad love.

Well she asked, "What do you need,"
I said "What do you believe,"
I need bad, bad love.

How can I care anymore?
Bring me a love
A bad, bad love
Right now
Oh, bad, love, oh!

I went marching though the mall today,
Singing bad, bad love.
I went marching through the ghetto today,
Singing bad, bad love.

She asked "What is it you need,"
"A love the devil can't reach,
I need a bad, bad love."

Our scriptures turned to sand,
Our boy become a man,
With a bad, bad love.
Fill me with love,
(Oh) bad, bad, love,
Bad, bad love
Right now
