(Denis LePage)

(Chorus 1, Repeat 2x)
Did you see that girl?
Did you see that girl?

(Repeat Chorus 2x)

I'm out of control
The moment she comes close to me
I can't play the role
The man that I'm supposed to be
I feel that it's true
I think that she's the one for me
I wish it was true
I picture she could come to me

(Repeat Chorus 1 2x)

She has to be mine
I need to feel her touching me
She looks so defined
I know that she can set me free
Her lips are delicious
Her smile is divine
Her eyes make me anxious
When she's looking at mine

(Chorus 2, Repeat 4x)
Did you see that girl?
(Did you see that girl?)
(Did you see that girl?)

(Repeat Chorus 1)

Ooh, baby

Ooh, babe

(Repeat Chorus 1)

I'm out of control
(Did you see that girl?)
(Did you see that girl?)
I can't play the role
(Did you see that girl?)
(Did you see that girl?)
She has to be mine
(Did you see that girl?)
(Did you see that girl?)
She looks so defined
(Did you see that girl?)
(Did you see that girl?)

Ooh, did you see that girl?
(Did you see that girl?)
(Did you see that girl?)

(Repeat Chorus 2)

Did you see that girl?
