I tried to run but couldn't get too far
My heart is bumpin' but still runnin' in place
No matter how hard I try to get your touch
When you're away to love a girls is too much
But every time I run I oh so bad

But I'm running as still my heart's beatin' so fast
I heard that you could make a man change his plan
That's why I'm running fast, I'm running to honey your (dash)

I run for the heels, girl that you wore
How you appeal you see I never know
I told her folks (her love a double face)
Delight me a smoke so I can sing some jazz

Now here come in late, here come those eyes
And me the one I can never deny
I try to ?, move as I can
But I guess I need another plan
I need you lovin' baby, oh so bad

Girl I'm runnin' as (still') my heart's beatin' so fast
I heard that you could make a man change his plan
That's why I'm running fast, I'm running to honey your (dash)

Your love gets stronger
And it feels like everyday it's getting longer
I feel your love like a monkey on my back
Girl your honey's so big see I can feel the attack

Oh oh
I need some lovin'
I, I want your lovin'
I can have your lovin'
I need to, got to, got to have your lovin'
