Follow trails of you to here
Every mile takes you my way
Rolling faster than we can

Tables turnin' all the time
I'm the dog at your feet
So we are it again

You're the one

Fucking have to wait a dime
Every single flingin' mile
They're coming faster all the while

You're the one

Ain't it somethin', we're born to hula
