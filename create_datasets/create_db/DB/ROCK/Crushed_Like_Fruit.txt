Never exhume me, 
I don't want you, 
My dream, 
Just like a waterfall in black and white. 
But you needed to know that I lied to you, 
But you needed to know that I lied to you, 
Why don't you stay here? 
Does she love you? 
My dream, 
To cruise through outer space and feel the breeze, 

But you needed to know that I lied to you, 
But you needed to know that I lied to you, 
But you needed to know that I lied to you, 
But you needed to know that I lied to you, 

I can't believe this dream, 
I can't believe this dream, 
I can't believe this dream, 
I can't believe I tried so hard to die, 
And now you want your money back, 
I can't believe this dream, 
I can't believe this dream, 
I can't believe this dream, 
I can't believe that I have to live without you
