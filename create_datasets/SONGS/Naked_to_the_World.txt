Hello stranger, don't say a word
'Cause we haven't got much time
So for now just hold me
I'm wishing on a star, baby, to follow where you are
And to shine, like you shined when your love was mine
Before we were, now what we are

Baby, there's a silence that's golden in my eyes
And if you'd just listen my lips will tell you why
That when I say that I'm a lonely girl
I'm feeling like I'm naked to the world
And if you leave with my defenses down
I'll never hear another sound but my heart
Beating, hush don't explain
'Cause we've got to make the most
Out of every moment

I'm wishing, wishing on a star to follow where you are
And though the time moves so fast in the hourglass
Can you give me now what you are
Baby there was winter in our discontent
And if you just listen I'll tell you what I meant

That when I say that I'm a lonely girl
I'm feeling like I'm naked to the world
And if you leave with my defenses down
I'll never hear another sound but my heart
Beating, beating, whoa, whoa, whoa

Naked to the silence that's ringing, ringing in my ears
And if you'd just listen my lips are gonna tell you dear
That when I say that I'm a lonely girl
I'm feeling like I'm naked
I'm feeling like I'm naked
I'm feeling like, I'm feeling like I'm naked
Naked, naked to the world
Naked to the, naked to the world

That when I say that I'm a lonely girl
Oh I can't stand it, no I can't stand it
That ain't the way no, that ain't the way God planned it
Naked to the world, I'm just a lonely girl
I'm living in a lonely world
And if you walk out my door
I won't be able to stand no more
