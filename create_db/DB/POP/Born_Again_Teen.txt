It’s a feeling like a born again teen
Got a heart beat like we’re only sixteen

Would you take my hand baby
You know you know I like to dance maybe
We'll be good we can be good, you and I 

You can follow me
Or if you want to take the lead
You know it’s obvious we naturally align

It’s a feeling like a born again teen
Got a heart beat like we’re only sixteen
It’s a feeling like a born again teen
Got a heart beat like we’re only sixteen

Pull me in a little closer
Do you recognize me
I have had my eye on you for quite a while

Never seen your moves like this and all with such self confidence
I'm thinking how your lips taste next to mine

My knees shake and my hair is raising, burning from this heat we're making
When the beat kicks in will we survive?

It’s a feeling like a born again teen
Got a heart beat like we’re only sixteen

Somebody help me please
I don’t think it’s just me
I’m dyin’, dyin’

I know it’s not just me
Can somebody help me please
I could just die, die

Oh, yeah
Ah
La la la la la la
Ah
La la la la la la
It’s a feeling like a born again teen
Got a heart beat like we’re only sixteen

Ah 
La la la la la la 
It’s a feeling like a born again teen
Got a heart beat like we’re only sixteen
