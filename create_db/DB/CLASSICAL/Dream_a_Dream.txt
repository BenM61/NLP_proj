When the night is still
And the sea is calm
Lonely shadow, you call upon me

Lay by my side
Fear not tonight
Lonely shadow, you'll find a new light

Dream a dream
And see through angel's eyes
A place where we can fly away

Ride with me upon a shining star,
Above the moonlit sky
We will find Elysium

Hear the nightingale
Sing a lullaby
Lonely shadow, you'll find a new light

Dawn will be kind,
All will be bright,
Lonely shadow, rise from the darkness

Dream a dream
And see through angel's eyes
A place where we can fly away

Ride with me upon a shining star,
Above the moonlit sky once more

We'll dream a dream
And see through angel's eyes
A place where we can fly away

We'll dream a dream
And see through angel's eyes
A place where we can fly away
In Elysium
