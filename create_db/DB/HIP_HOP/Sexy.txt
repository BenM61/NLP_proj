She was unlike anything I've ever seen. 
Body so phat so I said 
"I got to be that one man leaving tonight 
With your hand in mine". 
Oh what's your name, push up on me, do your thang. 
I love that you have no shame, 
So sexy I feel your game. 

[Chorus]
(No) You're so sexy girl 
What does it take to get close to you? 
Girl I'm loving the things that you do 
So come do it to me (Whoa) 
You're so sexy girl 
What does it take to get close to you? 
Girl I'm loving the things that you do 
So come do it to me (Whoa) 

(Baby tell me can we play this game) 
I want to know it's about to go down 
Cause your body looks like Honey. 
(I'm feelin' you, your feelin' me the same) 
And I want to come and kiss you more 
Cause your lips look good like Honey. 
(Baby girl I don't play games to loose) 
I want to know it's about to go down 
Cause your body looks like Honey. 
(Anything you want I'll do to you) 
And I want to come and kiss you more 
Cause your lips look good like Honey. 

Darkchild (oh) we gon make it hot 
All my people the floor (ooh) we gon' make it hot. (woo) 
Shawn Desman (oh) we gon make it hot 
We gon' keep this thing moving (ooh) like it just don't stop. (woo) 

Now she's acting like she is all that 
And I said, "What you got" the fact that she said 
"You know I'm stacked" then I said 
"No disrespect but girl you've got more than a little bit" 
Then she said "Can you notice?" 
Then I said, "girl don't start it". 
Then she said "If I do then I'll finish". 

[Chorus]

(Baby tell me can we play this game) 
I want to know it's about to go down 
Cause your body looks like Honey. 
(I'm feelin' you, your feelin' me the same) 
And I want to come and kiss you more 
Cause your lips look good like Honey. 
(Baby girl I don't play games to loose) 
I want to know it's about to go down 
Cause your body looks like Honey. 
(Anything you want I'll do to you, yeah) 
And I want to come and kiss you more 
Cause your lips look good like Honey. 

Baby girl I'm feeling you 
Do to me what you want to do. 
The way you play, make me want to say 
Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey. 
There's no way for me to explain 
How I got caught up in your game. 
In my time and your body's sayin'
Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey. 

(Baby tell me can we play this game) 
I want to know it's about to go down 
Cause your body looks like Honey. 
(I'm feelin' you, your feelin' me the same) 
And I want to come and kiss you more 
Cause your lips look good like Honey. 
(Baby girl I don't play games to loose) 
I want to know it's about to go down 
Cause your body looks like Honey. 
(Anything you want I'll do to you) 
And I want to come and kiss you more 
Cause your lips look good like Honey.
