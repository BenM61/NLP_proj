I told you that I loved you
Time and time again
But you got me crying, baby

And my tears are flowing just like rain

Well, I'm all alone and blue as can be
And I'm walking, walking
Walking up a one way street

I would treat you, honey
I'd treat you so good
If I could I really would
And sometimes I think I should

Well, I'm all alone and blue as can be
And I'm walking, walking
Walking up a one way street

You know, it don't take much
It don't take much to please me
But every day here lately
Seems like all you do is tease me

Well, I'm all alone and blue as can be
And I'm walking, walking
Walking up a one way street

I thought one day, baby
I'd live to be your fool
Seems as though it's the other way around
And I'm walking to my doom

Well, I'm all alone and blue as can be
And I'm walking, walking
Walking up a one way street
