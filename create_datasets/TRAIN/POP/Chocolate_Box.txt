You're talking candy from the jar
You spin the lid
Which one first?
Desert of temptation
What soda will quench this thirst?

Don't wonna be left behind
The grass is always greener on the other side
So don't you treat me like the first 

Chocolate in the box
I know you'll take another

What you want is a looker
Not a lover in the box

'Cause I know you'll take another
What you want is a looker

Not a lover I've discovered
You want your cake and eat it with a silver spoon in your hand
Don't give me that innocent girl thing
'Cause I'll close the door with a slam
Don't want to be left behind

Chocolate in the box
I know you'll take another

Chocolate in the box
I know you'll take another

Chocolate in the box
I know you'll take another

Chocolate in the box
I know you'll take another
