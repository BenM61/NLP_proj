Indian woman let down your hair
Indian woman let down your hair
Blood red wine layered in time
Blood red wine layered in time

Standing at the edge of the world
Please help me girl please help me girl

Standing at the forest awaiting your penance
Standing at the forest awaiting your penance
Indian woman let down your hair
Indian woman let down your hair

Standing at the edge of the world
Please help me girl please help me girl

All the temples stand in ruin
Reaching out to the gods in the sky
While the Earth beats to the rhythm
My Indian lover's high high
