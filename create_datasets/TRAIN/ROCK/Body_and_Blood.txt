This grave hill stinks of death
A reek from the ground
Catches whiff of the hound
A dead ones breath
The casket lid is cold
Waiting inside
Is someone petrified
That odors old

His body and blood
Sharing in common
His body and blood
His body and blood
Serving Messiah ooh

His body and blood
Sharing in common
His body and blood
His body and blood
Serving Messiah 
Son of God

The bitter taste is sweet
So eat Nazarene
And you kiss the obscene
Anointed feet

His body and blood
Sharing in common
His body and blood
His body and blood
Serving Messiah ooh

His body and blood
Sharing in common
His body and blood
His body and blood
Serving Messiah
Son of God

Receive, consume
Receive, consume
Digest
Defecate

His body and blood
Sharing in common
His body and blood
His body and blood
Serving Messiah
Son of God
