Something's in the wind
Something I can't touch
Just a feeling that I've got, oh no

Am I losing you
Am I losing you
Is there something that I can do
Am I losing you

Keep on telling me
No, please, not tonight
Something just ain't right, oh no

Am I losing you
Am I losing you
Is there something that I can do
Am I losing you

Those happy days we spent together
Can you forget them overnight
This was supposed to last forever
But forever's slipping out of sight

Used to get to you 
'Til you'd shake inside
But you ain't satisfied, oh no

Am I losing you
Am I losing you
Is there something that I can do
Am I losing you
