Early in the morning 'bout the break of day
That's when my baby went away
Crying and pleading won't do no good
Come back baby, I wish you would

I love you baby, I can't help myself
I wouldn't mistreat you for nobody else
Huggin and kissin late at night
Really make make me, baby, feel alright
Tell me now baby what you trying to do
Trying to love me and some other man too

Staying out drinking all night long
Cold now, baby, I want to come home
Please pretty baby give me one more chance
You know I love you, want to be your man

Crying and pleading won't do no good
Come back baby I wish you would
Huggin and kissin late at night
Really make me, baby, feel alright
