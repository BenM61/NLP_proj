Adios
In leaving you it grieves me to say
Adios
I'll be so lonely, for you only
I sigh and cry my Adios
Adios to you

And in this heart
Is mem'ry of what used to be dear for you and me set apart
Moon watching and waiting above
Soon it will be blessing our love

Adios
For happy endings I'll return dear to you
With a love true no more to you
Adios

Adios
Adios
