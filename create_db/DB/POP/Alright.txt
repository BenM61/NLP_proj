And no-one ever listens
To a word I say
Kill enthusiasm
'Cause I've found that day

Though it over and over and over again
Then you rip me down
Trying over and over and over again
And you happy now?
You're a fool
You're gonna end up in a hole
You never finish what you started
Forever telling you I though it over and over and over again

See it coming for you
See it every day
Try to ignore you
You get my way (yeah yeah yeah!)
And it's alright [Repeat: x 4]

Gonna end up in a hole
Now you got me moving
Now I've got a taste
You can't stop me smiling
I'm laughing in your face

It's true
You're gonna end up in a hole
You never finish what you started
Forever telling you I though it over and over and over again

See it coming for you
See it every day
Try to ignore you
You get my way (yeah yeah yeah!)
And it's alright [Repeat: x 4]

Gonna end up in a hole
Laugh about me all you like
Talk behind me, I don't mind
Let me tell you I'm alright

Gonna end up in a hole (whoa-oa-oa)
Laugh about me all you like (whoa-oa-oa)
Talk behind me, I don't mind (whoa-oa-oa)
Let me tell you I'm alright!

Thought it over, over and over
Thought it over, over again [Repeat: x 2]

See it coming for you
See it every day
Try to ignore you
You get my way (yeah yeah yeah!)
And it's alright [Repeat: x 8]

Gonna end up in a hole
You're gonna end up in a hole
You never finish what you started
Don't mind me telling you I though it over and over and over again
