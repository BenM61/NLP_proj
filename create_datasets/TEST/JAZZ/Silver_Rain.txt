Come let yourself be
Come see the possibilities
Let love take over your pain
And heal to the river of the rain

Girl, come and be still
Free your mind and your body will be well
And keep this melody
Tucked away in your heart for you and me

Oh, yeah, let my love erase your pain
Sun gonna shine, gonna shine again
Then we'll dance in the silver rain
Can you feel it?
(come on and dance in the silver rain)
Its gonna be all right
Tomorrow you'll live your dreams in the sunlight
Can you feel it?
(reach up and touch the silver rain)
Make you feel brand new
The silver rain is falling
Let it get all over you
Silver rain

Come, come with me
Cast your cares and your worries to the sea
And when, the day is gone
And will dance into the setting sun

Oh, yeah
Cause only love can set you free
Oh yes it can
Oh yes it can
So take my hand and come with me
And we'll walk in the silver rain

Can you feel it?
Come on and dance in the silver rain
Its gonna be all right
Tomorrow you'll live your dreams in the sunlight
Can you feel it?
Reach up and touch the silver rain
Make you feel brand new
The silver rains is falling
Let it get all over you
Let it get all over you
All over you
Let it get all over you
Silver rain
Silver rain

Oh, yeah
Cause only love can set you free
So take my hand and come with me
And we'll dance in the silver rain
Can you feel it?
Come on and dance in the silver rain
Its gonna be all right
Tomorrow you'll live your dream in the sunlight
Can you feel it?
Reach up and touch the silver rain
Make you feel brand new
The silver rains is falling
Let it get all over you
All over you
Can you feel it?
