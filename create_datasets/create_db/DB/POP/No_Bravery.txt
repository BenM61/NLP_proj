There are children standing here
Arms outstretched and to the sky
Tears drying on their face
He has been here
Brothers lie in shallow graves
Fathers lost without a trace
A nation blind to their disgrace
Since he's been here

And I see no bravery
No bravery
In your eyes anymore only sadness
And I see no bravery
No bravery
In your eyes anymore only sadness
Only sadness

Houses burnt beyond repair
The smell of death is in the air
A woman weeping in despair says
He has been here
Tracer lighting up the sky
It's another family's turn to die 
A child afraid to even cry out says
He has been here

And I see no bravery (no bravery)
No bravery (no bravery)
In your eyes anymore only sadness
And i see no bravery
No bravery
In your eyes anymore only sadness

There are children standing here
Arms outstretched and to the sky
But no one asks the question why
He has been here
Old men kneel to except their fate
Wives and daughters cut and raped
A generation drenched in hate says
he has been here

And I see no bravery
No bravery
In your eyes anymore only sadness
And I see no bravery
No bravery
In your eyes anymore

Anymore
Anymore
Anymore

And I see no bravery 
No bravery 
In your eyes anymore only sadness
And I see no bravery
No bravery
In your eyes anymore only sadness
Only sadness
