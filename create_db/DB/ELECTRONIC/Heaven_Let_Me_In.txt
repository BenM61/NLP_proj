Heaven let me in, heaven let me in
Heaven let me in, heaven let me in
This time
Heaven let me in
This time
Heaven let me in
This time

I don't think I deserve this, for all my sins
You could wait for a lifetime but I walked right in
Since I made a decision to let things go
The voice in my head only says what I need to know

Heaven let me in, heaven let me in
Heaven let me in, heaven let me in

But with all the temptation I can't resist
I could wait on the sideline, but I dive right in
Since I made a decision to free my soul
You know that I'm fine with the things that I can't control

Heaven
Heaven let me in, heaven let me in
This time
Heaven let me in
This time
Heaven let me in
This time
Heaven let me in
This time

Heaven let me in
Heaven let me in, heaven let me in
Heaven let me in, heaven let me in
Heaven let me in, heaven let me in
This time
Heaven let me in, heaven let me in
This time
Heaven let me in, heaven let me in
This time
Heaven let me in, heaven let me in
