Finding you was incredible
Losing you would be unbearable
For you woman, I'd go through hoops of fire

Somethings are impossible
'Cause some folks never try
Some folks see an obstacle
And they never get by

I used to be that way before
I met you, baby
But the force of your gentle touch
Too much is not enough for me

Whoa, I'll go through hoops of fire
I'll do anything
(Anything)
To get close to you

I'll go through hoops of fire
To prove to you
(To prove to you)
That no one else will do

And nothing can keep me from you
No, no, no, no, baby

Finding you was incredible
In every way, you show me why
(Why girl)
Losing you would be unbearable
I'd lose the meaning you've brought to my life

You've done for me
What no one else could ever do
Through your love I've got the strength
To face up to anything
God, I'm telling you the truth

I would go through
(Hoops of fire)
To prove to you
(To prove to you)
That no one else will do

(Nothing)
Nothing
(Will keep me)
Keep me from you

I'll take a chance
I'd risk it all
I'll get back on my feet
If I should happen to fall

It's all because of you
That I am what I am
I'll get down on my knees
If you ask me to, don't you know

I'd go through
(Hoops)
Oh yes I will baby
(Of fire)
Whoa, I'll do anything
(Anything)
To get close to you

(Ah hoops)
Ah my, my, my, my, my, my, my, baby
(Of fire)
Oh yes I will, I'll prove to you
(Prove to you)
That no one else is gonna do

No
(Nothing)
Nothing
(Could keep me)
Is gonna keep me from you, baby, baby

(Oh oh, hoops of fire)
I'll go through hoops of fire
Oh I'll do anything
(Anything)
To get close to you, baby
