Can we sail to Spain?
Just me and you
Open ocean and the bright blue sky above
Well do you want, do you want the moon?
I'll get it for you

From the top so high, to the valley low
I wanna give you whatever you need, so just let me know
Cause all I want is more of you

All I want is you

"Give me a dance," she says
"Just take my hand," she says
I don't want anything
Let's make a getaway
Just me and you, babe
The rest of the world can wait
Cause I've been waiting for you, oh
I've been waiting for you, oh

With the world we know waiting on hold
Do you think that we can really just be alone?
Far from all that seems to keep us apart

I need you, so don't leave yet
Find a way to stay even if just for a moment
Cause all I need is more of you

All I want is you

"Give me a dance," she says
"Just take my hand," she says
I don't want anything
Let's make a getaway
Just me and you, babe
The rest of the world can wait
Cause I've been waiting for you, oh
I've been waiting for you, oh

"Give me a dance," she says
"Just take my hand," she says
I don't want anything
Let's make a getaway
Just me and you, babe
The rest of the world can wait
Cause I've been waiting for you
I've been waiting for you

"Give me a dance," she says
"Just take my hand," she says
I don't want anything
Let's make a getaway
Just me and you, babe
The rest of the world can wait
Cause I've been waiting for you, oh

I've been waiting for you, waiting for you
Been waiting for you
