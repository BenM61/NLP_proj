All I wanna do is go out trappin' with the shooters
Wrist game froze, you should see the way we do it
Sexy little bitch she throwin' titties out the window
You from outta town but you know what we get into

All I wanna do is go out trappin' with the shooters
Wrist so froze you should see how I been movin'
Shawty said she down and I be flexing with all the shooters
Shawty, ah you gotta give head to all my shooters, oh

I came in, I just pulled it off the lot
Sailing like a pirate how I came in with the yacht
I came up off of trapping off the spot
Tell me if you fuckin' cause it's backups if you're not
I'm just, flexin, two hoes, wooh
Threesome, said she, two bras, ooh
Every time I step out, shit lit
I just walked in, Heisman your bitch (straight up)
Boy dem try to catch me with the shooters
Just know I'm down to catch one if you shoot us
And no more puttin' shooters in the Uber
'Cause they can't hop back in it when they

All I wanna do is go out trappin' with the shooters
Wrist game froze, you should see the way we do it
Sexy little bitch she throwin' titties out the window
You from outta town but you know what we get into

All I wanna do is go out trappin' with the shooters
Wrist so froze you should see how I been movin'
Shawty said she down and I be flexing with all the shooters
Shawty, ah you gotta give head to all my shooters, oh

I came in, I just pulled up with the slab
She don't know her father but lil' mama call me dad
Go designer shopping, caught me fucking up the tab
Rich for my bitches, thick as f*ck, I had to brag
All these diamonds on me (Woo)
Don't it, get you, horny? (Woo)
It's late but I can't leave, it's lit
Rollin' top down, my shit legit (straight up)
Police tryna catch me with the shooters
You not from the ends, you cannot fool us
I caught a felony and beat that shit the next week
I stack it tall, Lisa Leslie, 'cause

All I wanna do is go out trappin' with the shooters
Wrist game froze, you should see the way we do it
Sexy little bitch she throwin' titties out the window
You from outta town but you know what we get into

All I wanna do is go out trappin' with the shooters
Wrist so froze you should see how I been movin'
Shawty said she down and I be flexing with all the shooters
Shawty, are you down to give the head to all my shooters, oh?
