En garde, my God, how she gettin' me
Either we'll never get it right or it's meant to be
My ego, her pride, some recipe
We're our biggest fans and our own worst enemies
Ain't shy, let the whole world know
Haven't tuned in to the blow by blow
She move, I move, let her go, I go
Stir it up, stand back, watch a firework show
Ayo, too proud to quit when it's broken
Too in denial to admit when it's over
Drown in the separate ends of an ocean
Both in too deep to know where the coast is
Surrounded by waves and the hurricanes
Gaze, when we together ain't none of y'all safe
So buckle or get out of our way
Up in smoke, down in flames 'cause man

When we fight fire with fire
When we cross the line, ayo
Maybe happy ever after's ain't for us
Ain't no surprise when
We play with knives, ayo
Ain't no broken pride and these aren't paper cuts

Ain't no broken pride and these aren't paper cuts

One by one on a hunt
Nowhere to hide, nowhere left to run
But I'd rather war with you all of summer
Than a low key peace with another, ayy
One by one every cut
Yeah, gets deeper, who they to judge
'Cause when it's on we roar like the thunder
Then it's RIP to the other days
Cycle repeat to the lesson get learned, man
You play with fire, your bridges get burnt, man
Standoff, only making this worse
But don't nobody move and nobody gets hurt, man
We just caught in our ways
Sucker-punches traded, all fun and games
I dealt her cards, fall where they lay
Then it's all 'can't even, whatever, anyway

When we fight fire with fire
When we cross the line, ayo
Maybe happy ever after's ain't for us
Ain't no surprise when
We play with knives, ayo
Ain't no broken pride and these aren't paper cuts

I know when you're weakest
You know where my demons hide
Put us on a knife edge
Tell 'em everything inside, yeah
I know when you're weakest
You know where my demons hide
Put us on a knife edge
Tell 'em everything inside

When will we learn
We've come to far in this to see
How much it hurts
When will we learn
You and I
We've come too far in this to know
When to let go

Are we our better halves
If we only make it worse?
Are we better off apart
But can't say the words
When will we learn
You and I
We've come too far in this to see
All we ever do is bleed

When we fight fire with fire
When we cross the line, ayo
Maybe happy ever after's ain't for us
Ain't no surprise when
We play with knives, ayo
Ain't no broken pride and these aren't paper cuts

I know when you're weakest
You know where my demons hide
Put us on a knife edge
Ain't no broken pride and these aren't paper cuts
I know when you're weakest
You know where my demons hide
Put us on a knife edge

Ain't no broken pride and these aren't paper cuts
