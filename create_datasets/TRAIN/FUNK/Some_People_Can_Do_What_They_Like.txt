(Robert Palmer)

I'm restless when I see the likes of you
I'll take it any way you want me to
If you're hungry I know you're gonna move your ground
I get breathless when I see the likes of you around

Some people, some people can do what they like
I said that some people, some people can do what they like
Know that some people, yeah some people can do what they like

When I'm with you
Don't want to be with no-one else
Let's get up on it 
Till we just can't stand ourselves
There's times when love is just like poetry
Hey don't you think that's's how it ought to be

Some people, some people can do what they like
Some people, some people can do what they like yeah yeah
Some people, some people can do what they like

Hey lover will you be polite with me
Be covered if you spend some time with me
I'm restless when I see the likes of you
I'll take you anyway you want me to

Some people, some people can do what they like
Some people, some people can do what they like
Some people, some people can do what they like
Some people, some people can do what they like
Some people, can do what they like
Some people, can do what they like
