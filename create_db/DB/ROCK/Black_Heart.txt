Spring is frozen now i'm stuck in low
Wrapped with wire, tapped to the heart
Can't find no poison, now i've got no cure
(The) fangs are stuck inside my skin

Payne county line
Watching unjust claims
One man's righteousness is another man's
Long haul, sentence carried out

Long haul, counting the miles
To the four corners of the world
Spring is rusted shut, (faith's) coiled and cracked
Apparitions worth their weight in gold

Scratched in metal, name erodes away
Hands are scarred, heart is charred
Burnt though, and ashen
Trip on fence post line

Sifting through the remains
One man's close pursuit is another man's
Last chance, make it through the divide
Last chance, suffer the weight or get buried by this

Black heart, sweeping over the land
Black heart, crawling its way
To the four corners of the world
