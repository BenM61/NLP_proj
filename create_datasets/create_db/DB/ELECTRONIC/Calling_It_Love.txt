I lay here beside you, just thinkin' all night
I believe that tomorrow would make things all right
I still tell you I love you, that you're forever mine
It makes you feel good and it buys me some time

[Chorus:]
If I told you I needed you
But I sent you away
I've been calling it love
Because I want you to stay
Calling it love
Say you'll stay
Calling it love
'Cause I'm too scared to say
Let's call it a day

I never questioned my feelings before
I felt but I felt there was it, nothin' more
But I can't keep denying the truth in my heart
Ooo, the touching and talking but we're oceans apart

[Chorus]

I've been spending my life
Thinking you're the one
Now I'm holding my lies
And the damage was done

If I told you I needed you
But I sent you away
I've been calling it love
Because I want you to stay
Calling it love
Say you'll stay
Calling it love
'Cause I'm too scared to say

I've been calling it love
I've been calling it love
Because I want you to stay
Calling it love
Say you'll stay

Calling it love
'Cause I'm too scared to say
I've been calling it love...
I've been calling it love...
