Somebody get me out this mess I'm in
See I've been tryin' to do the best I can
But I keep on stumblin' over and over again
I ain't got no more excuses for ya
All that I can say is sorry
Won't you please come rescue me as quickly as you can

It's crazy how far we go
Just to put a little gas in our ego
That's what happens when your self esteem is low
We'll do anything to get people to notice us I know
It's tough but hey, imagine us throwin' our lives away
Because we're listenin' to the voice inside that chants
Says we'll never be significant if we can't
Fit in so we get into all kinds of trouble tryin' to be somebody we're not
Since in the beginning we've been givin' into the lie that says that we got
To keep up with the Jones's or get left behind
So we end up in debt tryin' to catch up it's messed up
'Cause ten years from now we can't press rewind
I want to invest in what stands the test of time

Somebody get me out this mess I'm in

I'm so sick and tired of being down and out
Tryin' to do what's right but wrong keeps comin out
I keep on tryin to write but songs ain't comin out
Plus now I'm getting older and time is runnin out I know,
Growth's a process but I can't see my progress
And I'm startin' to feel that my labor's in vain
So I hold on to the promise instead of my problems
Otherwise this stress is gonna drive me insane
Yes there's more to life than workin' 9 to 5
Buyin' things that make you feel fuzzy inside
I tried it and it worked at first for five minutes
But left me in the cold to hang like icicles oh!
Now I'm froze like a popsicle
Feel's like my mission's impossible
I'm stuck up in a maze full of obstacles
Keep on ending where I'm not supposed to go

Somebody get me out this mess I'm in
See I've been tryin' to do the best I can
But I keep on stumblin' over and over again
I ain't got no more excuses for ya
All that I can say is sorry
Won't you please come rescue me as quickly as you can

I just want to be okay with who I am, not have to run away
I'm so tired of trends I can't keep pretending
Playing these foolish games

Somebody get me out this mess I'm in
See I've been tryin' to do the best I can
But I keep on stumblin' over and over again
I ain't got no more excuses for ya
