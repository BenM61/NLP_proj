(Turn the lights on! )
Soaking wet
She can't keep dry
I need a bed
Me not tell no lie

Put both your hands
Upon the wall
Fleed up girl
I won't let you fall

Gotta friend 'round see
There as you there
Put it down repeat
Why you do that girl

Gotta little lower
Push on wine
She gon' feel my power
She gon' blow my mind

5...4...3...2...
1...Girl, time is up
I want to see all of your line is up
Soon I'll spend all night tight up with her
Up tight, up with her
Up tight, up with her

[Chorus]
'Cause me love it when you push it up on me
Suh me love it when you twist up weh body on me
She know I can't resist when she on me
Suh me love it when you twist up weh body on me

Send it down on me,
Fling it up on me,
Suh me love it when she twist up weh body on me
When fine in all day
Come girl and show me
Suh me love it when you twist up your body on me

(Turn the lights on! )
Suh me love it when you twist up your body on me
'Cause me love it when you twist up your body on me

World em-Eminent(? ? ? ) Me ah represent

She a tell me say she loves my body
Sent why me ah give her the strength
Don't have to pear another send
Count she ah count on me land
