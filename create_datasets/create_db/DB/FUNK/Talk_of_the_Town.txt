I've been riding around with the top down
Like I always do
My love at my side, but only this time
My friends say something's changed you

They said you're running with the wrong set
The girl is someone you should never have met
Let her go on her own, son
Everyone else has just come undone

The old town fathers are up in arms
The city council is very alarmed
Cousins and uncles are having fits
Predictors of doom think this is it

Everybody else just stand around
Me and my baby, we're the talk of the town

The old statue there in the town square
Seems to stare at me
Walking around with my head down
They say can't we make you see

I said, ?Son, you know we're really color blind
But everybody else seems to really mind
Lose her now, I think you'll find
Everyone else will just fall in line?

The chamber of commerce are up in arms
The city council is very alarmed
Cousins and uncles are having fits
Predictors of doom think this is it

Everyone else is just thinking out loud
Me and my baby, we're the talk of the town

Probably not the first but surely not the last
Shouldn't throw stones out from your house of glass
'Round here lots of crackers and cheese
Stay away from those my daddy said to me
You'll get in trouble if you mess with these

Well, the old town fathers are up in arms
The city council is very alarmed
The cousins and uncles are having fits
Predictors of doom think this is it

Everybody else is just hanging around
Me and my baby, we're the talk of the town
