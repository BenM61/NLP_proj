Try to erase
The smell of freedom
And every face
That happened to meet mine

What still remains
Something unrelenting
I'll say the names
Of those I left behind

In the still of the night
Do you laugh do you cry
Do you try not to remember?
If it's a question of fate
Do you love do you hate
Do you try not to remember?

I see your eyes
In my own reflection
These broken skys
Begin begin to mend

We are the same
Fighting for something
What's left to gain?
There's no means to an end

In the still of the night
Do you laugh do you cry
Do you try not to remember?
If it's a question of fate
Do you love do you hate
Do you try not to remember?
In the still of the night
Do you laugh do you cry
Do you try not to remember?
If it's a question of fate
Do you love to you hate
Do you try not to remember?
