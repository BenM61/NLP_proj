Nobody sees her here, her eyes are slowly closing.
If she should want some peace she sits there, without moving,
And puts a pillow over the phone.
And if she feels like dancing, no one will know it.
Giving herself a chance there's no need to show her how it should be.

She can't remember now when she was all in pieces,
She's quite content to sit there listening to what he says,
How he didn't like to be alone.
And if he feels like crying she's there to hear him,
No reason to complain and nothing to fear, they always will be.
