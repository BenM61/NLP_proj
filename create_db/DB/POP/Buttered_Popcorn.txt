My baby likes buttered popcorn
He likes it greasy
And sticky
And gooey
And salty
I said what do you like
He says you know what I like
I like buttered popcorn

He took me to a show
He said he wanted some more
I said kiss me please
He said after I eat

I said what do you like
He says you know what I like
I like buttered popcorn

For breakfast, lunch and a dinner too
He eats buttered popcorn
Well it worries me so 
I don't know what to do
When I asked him what was happenin' in the world today
He said more butter, more butter, more butter, more
