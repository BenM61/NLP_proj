She's got what it takes 
she's got it all 
She's got what you need 
she's got a real wonderful time 

She's pulling the strings in many ways 
She's talking to me so clear with these wondergirls eyes 

And then the crowd goes aaah! 

She's the wonder 
She's the wondergirl for me 
And then the crowd goes aaah! 

She's taking my breath so far away 
She's stealing the words I wanna say pretty good lies 

She's turning the days into the night 
She's leading the dark into the light super fly high 

And then the crowd goes aaah! 

She's the wonder 
She's the wondergirl for me 
And then the crowd goes aaah!
