Eyeballs float in wet green grass
I got a chainsaw motor that's filled with rain, proof
When it sings like bach with eyes all bulging
When the pink sun drops the eyelids fold
While I'm in deep REM sleep or twilight zones
I take a freight elevator and press fast forward
I get to grind these teeth and beat through time
If I could bring things back they'd be that WILD

When I saw the future the Geeks were right

Egghead boys with thin white legs
They got modified features with software brains
But that's what the girls like, the geeks were right

When I saw the future the Geeks were right

Predator skills, chemical wars, plastic islands at sea
Watch what the humans ruin with machines

Eyeballs float in wet green grass
I'm in a chainsaw choir and dreams 
That bend that let me cut through time and stretch out bach
I make the dry eyes roll and wet eyes cross
While I'm in deep REM sleep or twilight zones 
I take the freight elevator and press fast forward
So I can grind these teeth and beat through time
If I could bring things back they'd be that wild

When I saw the future the Geeks were right
