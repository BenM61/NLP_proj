Tonight I gave the greatest performance of my life
I never lost control, I played the part so well
That not a single soul could tell that I was lying

And so
Though it was hard to face our friends
I gave a party
I know
I meant to show them all I've gotten over you
And though
I saw the unbelieving looks on all their faces
I had to try to make them think that it was true
So I
Who had me dance, dance through the night, just like a
Gypsy
And I
Who seldom drink, drank like a fish till I was high
And I

Who hadn't laughed since 
God knows when, outlaughed
Pagliacci
Till they
Believed it more than even I

Tonight I gave the greatest performance of my life
I never lost control, I played the part so well
That not a single soul could tell that I was lying

But love

if you had been behind the curtain when it fell
When all the lights were out and I was all alone
You would have seen

This actress crying
Yes, tonight I gave the greatest performance of my life
I never lost control, I played the part so well
That not a single soul could tell that I was lying

But love

if you had been behind the curtain when it fell
When all the lights were out and I was all alone
You would have seen

This actress crying
