I get the blues at bedtime
Them things don't leave until day
Hey-hey-hey, mama
I get the blues at bedtime
And them things don't leave until day
An if I just had you in my arms
Them blues would blow away

Now, if you love me baby
Try to keep me satisfied
Hey-hey, mama
If you love me, baby
Try to keep me satisfied
And will you low down your chariot
And let yo' po' daddy, ride?

Let's ride some, boy

Now, if I could go back to China
And start my life brand new
Hey-hey-hey, mama
If I could go back to China
And start my life brand new
I would tell the whole world
Jes' what I would do

I wouldn't-a started drinkin', gamblin'
I wouldn't run around
Hey-hey-hey, mama
I wouldn't-a started drinkin', gamblin'
Lord, I wouldn't run around
I think I would get married
Baby, and I would settle down.
