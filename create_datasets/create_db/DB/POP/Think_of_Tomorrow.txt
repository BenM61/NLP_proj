The future looks so bright ahead, the past is far behind
I think of all the things we said, and you are on my mind
Think of tomorrow. Think of tomorrow

Mexico has sunny skies, Hawaii knows no rain
Any place you want sweetheart, I will buy the ring
Think of tomorrow. Think of tomorrow

Anything you want sweetheart, anything you do
Anywhere you go sweetheart, I will follow you
Think of tomorrow. Think of tomorrow

Think of tomorrow. Think of tomorrow
This car I drive is old and beat, it may not see me through
This car I drive is fine with me, it's headed back to you
Think of tomorrow. Think of tomorrow
