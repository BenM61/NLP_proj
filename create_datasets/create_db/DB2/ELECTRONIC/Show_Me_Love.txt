This was an accident, not the kind were sorrow sounds,
Never even noticed were suddenly crumbling.
Tell me how you've never, felt delicate or innocent,
Do you still have doubts that us having faith makes any sense.
Tell me nothing ever comes rationale or breaking down.
Still somebody loses cause there's no way to turn around,
Staring at your photograph everything now in the past
Never felt so lonely I wish that you could show me love.

Show me Love, Show me Love, Show me Love, Show me Love,
Show me Love, Till you open the door.
Show me Love, Show me Love, Show me Love,
Show me Love, Show me Love, Till I'm up off the floor.
Show me Love, Show me Love, Show me Love, Show me Love,
Show me Love, Till its inside my pores.
Show me Love, Show me Love, Show me Love,
Show me Love, Show me Love, Till I'm screaming for more.

Random acts of mindlessness, common place occurrences,
Chances of surprises, another state of consciousness'
Yell me nothing ever comes rationale or breaking down
Still somebody loses cause theirs no way to turn around,
Tell me how you've never felt delicate or innocent,
Do you still have doubts that us having faith makes any sense,
You play games I play tricks, girls and girls but you're the one,
Like a game of pick up sticks played by fucking lunatics.

Show me Love, Show me Love, Show me Love, Show me Love,
Show me Love, Till you open the door.
Show me Love, Show me Love, Show me Love,
Show me Love, Show me Love, Till I'm up off the floor.
Show me Love, Show me Love, Show me Love, Show me Love,
Show me Love, Till its inside my pores.
Show me Love, Show me Love, Show me Love,
Show me Love, Show me Love, Till I'm screaming for more.

Show me Love, Show me Love, give me all that I want.
Show me Love, Show me Love, give me all that I want.
Show me Love, Show me Love, give me all that I want.
Show me Love, Show me Love, till I'm screaming for more
