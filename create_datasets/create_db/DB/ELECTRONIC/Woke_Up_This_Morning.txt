Well, you woke up this morning
Got yourself a gun
Your mama always said you'd be the chosen one

She said, you're one in a million, you've got to burn to shine
But you were born under a bad sign with a blue moon in your eyes

And you woke up this morning
All that love had gone
Your papa never told you about right and wrong

But you're looking good, baby
I believe you're feeling fine (shame about it)
Born under a bad sign with a blue moon in your eyes

Because you woke up this morning 
Got a blue moon in your eyes
Woke up this morning 
You got a blue moon in your eyes

Well, you woke up this morning
The world turned upside down
Lord above, thing's ain't been the same since Howlin' Wolf walked into your town
But you're one in a million, you've got that shotgun shine
Born under a bad sign with a blue moon in your eyes
You woke up this morning 
You got a blue moon in your eyes
Woke up this morning 
You got a blue moon in your eyes

When you woke up this morning everything was gone 
By half past ten your head was going ding-dong
Ringing like a bell from your head down to your toes,
Like a voice trying to tell you there's something you should know 
Last night you were flying but today you're so low
Ain't it times like these that make you wonder if you'll ever know 
The meaning of things as they appear to the others 
Wives, mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers 
Don't you wish you didn't function, don't you wish you didn't think beyond the next paycheck 
And the next little drink? 
Well, you do, so make up your mind to go on 'cause when you woke up this morning 
Everything you had was gone, everything you had was gone

Woke up this morning
Woke up this morning
Woke up this morning, you want to be, you want to be the chosen one tonight
Yes, you know, because you just get help yourself

Woke up this morning
Woke up this morning
Woke up this morning
You got yourself a gun, got yourself a gun, got yourself a gun
