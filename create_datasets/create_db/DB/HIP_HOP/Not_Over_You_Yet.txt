You were the first who ever brought me out 
Showed me what life and love was all about 
Gave me things that I never need 
You're in my thoughts, my every dream 

I found joy in your touch, I miss your kisses 
The way you made me blush 
Life is cruel now that you're gone 
I love you so I can't let go, yeah 

Not over you yet 
Not trying to forget 
The way that you loved me 
Not over you yet 
Not trying to forget 
The way that you loved me 

I hate you so for what you done to me 
Made me fall in love with no security 
I gotta move on move on my life 
But it's so hard when you're still on my mind 

I found joy in your touch 
I miss your kisses the way you made me blush 
Life is cruel now that you're gone 
I love you so I can't let go 
I'm crazy for you 

Not over you yet 
Not trying to forget 
The way that you loved me 
Not over you yet 
Not trying to forget 
The way that you loved me 

Not over you yet 
Not trying to forget 
The way that you loved me 
Not over you yet 
Not trying to forget 
The way that you loved me 

I miss your kisses 
I miss your touch 
I'm crazy for you 

Not over you yet 
Not trying to forget 
The way that you loved me 
Not over you yet 
Not trying to forget 
The way that you loved me 

Not over you yet 
Not trying to forget 
The way that you loved me 
Not over you yet 
Not trying to forget 
The way that you loved me 

Not yet 
Not over you yet 
Not trying to forget 
The way that you loved me 
Not over you yet 
Not trying to forget 
The way that you loved me
