Geah

Peace king

Peace king

Listen, if they wrote a book on your life

Right

You think anybody'll read it?

No fucking doubt!

Let's make history homey

Alright then

You know we brought the hoes clothes and money rolls to the table

No, fucking, doubt

It's time to manifest this

Shit we the flyest nigga

Bring it to a whole, y'know?

Gangsta nigga

Niggas better watch ya back, it's so cold
Pinky rings shining, so act like why'don't know
Bitches in heat for niggas that got dough
We the flyest gangsters
What you don't got is my natural glow
Counting out stacks and macking out hoes
Pushing big dicks and packing our chrome
We the flyiest gangsters

Follow, I'm like a Lamborghini green Diablo
Coupe VT, it's like DVD when I flow
Feel me, I'm loved like the great late Malik Sealy
The one the player haters hate dearly, but can't near me
Homicide can't scare me
I o-bide by the laws of these streets sincerely, a real nigga
The type that can build with ya
Verbalize bring life to a still picture, it's God-given
Been blessed with Allah's vision, strength and beauty
Truly my only duty is to dodge prison
Play wit me, I'm modest 'til them strays hit me
Regardless the circumstances I'ma stay filthy
Dough forever, the live stay low forever
And f*ck niggas, cause it's hard to keep them close together
One dependent, no wife, one co-defendant
No forms of weakness, I flow with vengeance

Niggas better watch ya back, it's so cold
Pinky rings shining, so act like why'don't know
Bitches in heat for niggas that got dough
We the flyest gangsters
What you don't got is my natural glow
Counting out stacks and macking out hoes
Pushing big dicks and packing our chrome
We the flyiest gangsters

I do what I can do when I can do it
Feel how I feel when I feel what I'm feeling
Live how I live it's only cause I been through it
Learn to try it like to eat it and shit it's nothing to it
Burn it light it weed it and off the liquor, while driving outside
I'll never catch a vehicular homicide
My music is a description of my vibe of course
My life, my sites, my thoughts, what I like on my fork
Cause you are what you eat, you eat what you can
You pray to bless the food but first you wash your hands
To wash away them bad spirits, don't bring it in your home
Once you let them in they staying, evil be gone, say it
I'm proud I'm ace but giving himself to the Lord
Wanted his Faith, think about Big anymore
Of course my nigga Horse got married, see shit is changing
We ain't these little niggas no more, running dangerous
I like to bone, I'm a peaceful brother
Eat up so much the girls call me seafood lover
Be having they legs shaking, stab 'em, break 'em
I'm Hercules Hercules when having relations, the fliest

Niggas better watch ya back, it's so cold
Pinky rings shining, so act like why'don't know
Bitches in heat for niggas that got dough
We the flyest gangsters
What you don't got is my natural glow
Counting out stacks and macking out hoes
Pushing big dicks and packing our chrome
We the flyiest gangsters

We put this on the, soul of our born

As we hold the Qu'ran

Kamikaze style

Older cats coachin us on

Yo it's kill or be killed

Understand, real'll be real

A forty-shot spectrum make your whole embassy kneel

Identity sealed, protected by

Our energy shield

And f*ck a drop, cause that's that shit that got Kennedy killed

Close the books

Was taught never expose a crook

Between the knight and the bishop

Want to knock ya rook, I'm a rare breed never had a fair to lead

I ain't light niggas recite

Too impaired to breathe

We both hard hit just like Camacho and Vargas, who's the target?

Now watch how we close the market, motherfuckers

Niggas better watch ya back, it's so cold
Pinky rings shining, so act like why'don't know
Bitches in heat for niggas that got dough
We the flyest gangsters
What you don't got is my natural glow
Counting out stacks and macking out hoes
Pushing big dicks and packing our chrome
We the flyiest gangsters

Niggas better watch ya back, it's so cold
Pinky rings shining, so act like why'don't know
Bitches in heat for niggas that got dough
We the flyest gangsters
What you don't got is my natural glow
Counting out stacks and macking out hoes
Pushing big dicks and packing our chrome
We the flyiest gangsters
