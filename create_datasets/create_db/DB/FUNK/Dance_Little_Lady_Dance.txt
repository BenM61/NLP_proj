Someone taught me how to dance last night
What a mover he was!
And someone taught me how to do it right
What a groover he was!
He taught me all the steps to do the Rock'n'Roll
I found my sense of rhythm but I lost myself control
When he said:
Dance little lady
Dance
Dance little lady
Dance
You know you've only got one chance
Come on
Dance
Dance
Dance
Oh
Oh.

Someone taught me how to move last night
What a looker he was!
And someone taught me how to do it right
What a cooker he was!
Now we boogie and we bump until we're fit to drop
And when he gets me goin' I don't want to stop
When he says:
Dance little lady
Dance
