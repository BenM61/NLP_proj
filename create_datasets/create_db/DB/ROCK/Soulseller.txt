Well, look out now when I come your way
Well, I'm a dog and I'm astray
Well, I've been taught but I won't learn
Been out of luck but baby it will turn

So I sold my soul again
Well, I can't turn back 'cause it's the place
I put my damn self in
And I will sell my soul to you
Well, now what I need has long been overdue

Blast my way with raging speed
Beelzebub gimme what I need, what I need now
I don't wanna wait to what comes around, there ain't no reason
He's gotta holler it now, I gotta hear that sound

Come on, so I sold my soul again
Well, I can't turn back 'cause it's the place
I put my damn self in
And I will sell my soul to you
Well, now what I need has long been overdue

I call it gold, some call it vile
But to place my bets on consolation prices
Just ain't my style, who'll care now
I've gotta get six six six, I've gotta go, well, I've gotta go now
Won't you burn with me when I make that show

(Incomprehensible) I sold my soul again
Well, I can't turn back 'cause it's the place
I put my damn self in
And I will sell my soul to you
'Cause now what I need has long been overdue

Soulseller, got a sale for you
Soulseller, got a sale for you
Soulseller, got a sale for you
