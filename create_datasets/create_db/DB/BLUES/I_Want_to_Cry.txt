I want to cry
When I hear your name
Though time goes by
I still feel the same

I want to cry
For dreams we might have shared
Though I know
You never have cared

Since you went away
I've been lonely and blue
I spend each lonesome day
Just crying for you

I want to cry
For what else can I do
When I know
I'll never stop loving you?

Since you've gone away, dear
I've been so lonesome and blue
I spend each lonesome day
Just crying for you

I want to cry
For what else can I do
When I know
I'll never stop loving you?
