I remember how you used to wait by the phone
Counting every minute that I was gone
And you used to call me sweet things in the morning light
After you would hug me so tender
Each and every night
Lately you got so much to do
And your never at home
By the time I get to see you
You need your time alone
I've been too afraid to ask you
But I need to know

Is this the way love goes
Say it isn't so
Is this the way love goes
Right before my eyes
Wearing a disguise
I need to know
Is this the way love goes

Staring at a photograph of you and I inframed
When I blink my eyes you start to fade away
Oh, I recall that day in fall and all the things you said
All of the promises that you never kept
Lately you got so much to do
And you're never at home
When I finally get to see you
You need you're time alone
I've been too afraid to ask you
But I need to know

Is this the way love goes
Say it isn't so
Is this the way love goes
Right before my eyes
Wearing a disguise
I need to know
Is this the way love goes

(Bridge)
Everybody needs to a love they can count on
I'm the kind of man who needs to know exactly where I stand

Stayin' up late at night I'm wondering
How we can make it right
Never gonna say goodbye
I'm crying
Find a way to make it right
