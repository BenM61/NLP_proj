When love in to my dreams was creeping 
I gave my heart in to your keeping 
It brought the harvest I am reaping 
And I always wonder now

When summer twilight's gently falling 
I'd love to know if you're recalling 
Your tender words to me enthralling 
And my heart is wond'ring still

When you have another's arms about you, 
Do you ever think of me 
When you whisper "I can't live without you," 
Do you ever think of me 
And when your eyes disguise the same old loving lies, 
You tell so tenderly 
Deep in your heart unfeeling 
When some heart you're stealing 
Do you ever think of me.
