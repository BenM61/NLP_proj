Walk like a ghost
Let your feet off the ground
Heart needs sound
Sound is love, love is you 
I know I'm never gonna make it anyway 
I think I'm gonna make it anyway 
I know but really I just don't care 
I think I'm gonna make it anyway 
I know the things that I just can't say 
I think I'm gonna say 'em anyway 
I know I think I've finally found my way 
I think I'm gonna make it today 

I think I'm gonna make it anyway 

Ready or not, that's your name, use it now
Please come back around, 
Sound is love, love is you 

I know I'm never gonna make it anyway 
I think I'm gonna make it anyway 
I know but really I just don't care 
I think I'm gonna make it anyway 
I know the things that I just can't say 
I think I'm gonna say 'em anyway 
I know I think I've finally found my way 
I think I'm gonna make it today 

I think I'm gonna make it anyway

I know that you won't but I will
Should just forget about it 
I know but really I just don't care 
So why you gotta fret about it 
I know that you don't think I 
Quit and just forget about it 
I know I think I've finally found my way 
I think I'm gonna make it today 
I think I'm gonna make it anyway

Walk like a ghost
Let your feet off the ground 
Heart needs sound
Sound is love, love is you 
Ready or not, that's your name, use it now 
Please come back around 
Sound is love, love is you 

I know I'm never gonna make it anyway 
I think I'm gonna make it anyway

I think I'm gonna say 'em anyway 
I know I think I've finally found my way 
I think I'm gonna make it today
