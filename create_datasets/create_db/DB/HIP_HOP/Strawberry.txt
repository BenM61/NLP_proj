Like strawberries, you're like my strawberries
Sometimes you're bitter, sometimes you're sweet
I feel the same way about you and me

Like strawberries, you're like my strawberries
Sometimes you're bitter, sometimes you're sweet
I feel the same way about you and me

You're talkin' me through changes
'Cause you know I'll do anything for you
Couldn't stop it if I wanted to

So I never know which way my heart is gonna go
How could someone so good make me feel so bad
Sometimes I wish I never had

It's like strawberries, you're like my strawberries
Sometimes you're bitter, sometimes you're sweet
I feel the same way about you and me

Like strawberries, you're like my strawberries
Sometimes you're bitter, sometimes you're sweet
I feel the same way about you and me

I need to feel that this love is real
'Cause I'm all confused and hurt inside
And I feel so bad I wanna to cry
Tried everything just to please my love

Said, I'll get on my knees each and every night
And I'll pray He'll bring us back to life

It's like strawberries, strawberries
Sometimes you're bitter, sometimes you're sweet
I feel the same way about you and me

Like strawberries, strawberries
Sometimes you're bitter, sometimes you're sweet
I feel the same way about you and me

Nigga, just wanna be in love
Just wanna love and live
You don't have to think about me
Doing somebody else
If you really want me to be your baby
Then you gotta stop actin' crazy

It's like strawberries, strawberries
Sometimes you're bitter, sometimes you're sweet
I feel the same way about you and me

Like strawberries, strawberries
Sometimes you're bitter, sometimes you're sweet
I feel the same way about you and me

Like strawberries, strawberries
Sometimes you're bitter, sometimes you're sweet
I feel the same way about you and me

Like strawberries, strawberries
Sometimes you're bitter, sometimes you're sweet
I feel the same way about you and me
