Atom bomb, TNT
New disease, poor city
Flying over Hiroshima, 1945
The city looks small from way up here
I wonder who'll survive

[Chorus]
Atom bomb, TNT
New disease, poor city
A blinding flash hotter than the sun
Dead bodies lie across the path
The radiation colors the air
Finishing one by one

[Chorus]
