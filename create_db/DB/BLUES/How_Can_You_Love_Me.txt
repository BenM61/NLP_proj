Now oh mama, how I love you
An you said you loved me, too
But I don't see how you can love me
Lord, an treat me like you do

You said you are mine
My-oh-my!
When you know you was leavin'
Gal, all the time

You can't be mine
And someone else's, too
Now how can you love me
Hoo, and treat me like you do?

I treat you nice and kind
Mama, in ev'ryway
You leave early in the ev'nin'
And don't come back
'Till the break of day

I don't care what you do
Gal, you know I still love you
But how can you love me
And treat me like you do?

Play it for me, boy

You didn't want me
Whilst I was nice and kind
But someday you gon' want me
An I'll be done change my mind

I'm 'ona find someone else
Mama, to tell my troubles to
How can you love me
Hoo, and treat me like you do?
