Go ahead and look at me 
'Cause that's what I want 
Take a good look won't you please 
'Cause that's what I want 

I know you wanna stare 
You can't help it and I don't care 
So look at me 
'Cause that's what I want 

Do you think I'm looking hot? 
Do you think this hits the spot? 
I was just looking at me, look at me

Do you think this hits the spot? 
I was just looking at me, look at me 

Go ahead and stare
And take a picture please
If you need
Anything that says it all

(Love, love, love, love)

Chasing it, I don't know why 
I think about it a lot 
Better hurry, running out of time 
I think about it a lot 

I can't tell anymore 
I don't know what I'm looking for 
You know what I need 
I think about it a lot

Running on empty but I have had plenty 
You're complimentary, but I'm just pretending 
Uniform, hide behind there, this is my diversion 
Go ahead and stare on my ragamuffin

Feeling so flaking, I dated you take it
When I'm in the mirror, put on my veneer 
I coulda sworn, it's a sure shot 
Are you under my convoy
Go ahead stare I'm a ragamuffin
