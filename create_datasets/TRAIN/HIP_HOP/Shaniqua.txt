"Hello nahnah she don't live here man
I thought I told you
I think you need to step off alright"

Moved into my apartment at the university
The only one that lives here is me so why the phone ring all day long
I got no friends except Mike and he's gone for the summer
And I just want some peace and quiet
Come to my room and it's a telephone riot
Ringalingaling every time I take a step, can't sleep can't eat
Can't breathe can't bitch I can't get my work done
'cause people keep callin' with the same damn question
"Hello is Shaniqua there?" "Nah Shaniqua moved out last year
 I think you have the wrong number This is Little T"
"You mean Shaniqua's brother?"
"Man can't you just leave me alone
 This ain't Shaniquas house this ain't her phone
 And don't call back again 'cause if you do you know the answer man"

Shaniqua don't live here no more
Shaniqua don't live here no more
Shaniqua don't live here no more
Is Shaniqua there hell no!
Shaniqua don't live here no more
Shaniqua don't live here no more
Shaniqua don't live here no more
Is Shaniqua there hell no!

I wonder who Shaniqua is what she does and where she lives
Is she a hothead with too many zits, a movie star with inflatable tits
Does she take the train or drive in a car
Work in an office or down at the bar
How the hell should I know she could be a bino for all I care
"Hello is Shaniqua there?" Yes she is but she can't talk now
She's busy milking our purple cow and talkin' to the Easter Bunny
"Man you think you're funny"
Shut up Beavis, I told you six times before

Shaniqua don't live here no more
Shaniqua don't live here no more
Shaniqua don't live here no more
Is Shaniqua there hell no!
Shaniqua don't live here no more
Shaniqua don't live here no more
Shaniqua don't live here no more
Is Shaniqua there hell no!

Check my machine on Friday there were 22 messages
Man I can't win at this one
Said this here's for the kid livin' with Shaniqua
You want that trick you can keep her
Will this ever cease so I can get some sleep
Shaniqua moved out leave your message at the beep (Beep!)
Shaniqua I love you call me

Shaniqua don't live here no more
Shaniqua don't live here no more
Shaniqua don't live here no more
Is Shaniqua there hell no!
Shaniqua don't live here no more
Shaniqua don't live here no more
Shaniqua don't live here no more
Is Shaniqua there hell no!
