Let me breathe, my tired body
Let me sleep inside my bed
Don't let me fall into the darkness
While you weave your tangled web
Don't leave me slain beside the gutter
Show me my flesh, then lock me in,
Then wash me down in holy water
Then close my eyes, until I'm gone

Throw my soul into the fire
Let my body burn in sin
It's so cold and I'm no liar
And it's all the same, all the same
It's just addiction

You can't deny the pain you're under
You know the wheel refuse to turn
Can't break that spell and you have 2 wonder
Can't walk away, you never learn
Don't live that lie, 'cause you can take it
You must have been some kind of man
I feel the rage of your condition
'cause you will find euphoria

Can you taste your last temptation?
Your state of mind is filled with shame
If you fail to shake your demon
Tormented life, no one to blame
