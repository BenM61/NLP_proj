Gimme the beat

Har Mar

All you hate-az
Step the f*ck off
I ain't got nothin' but love to ride
Sexy ladies
Dis the hate-az
Cause they ain't no play-az

You can feel me
Sexy body (sexy, sexy)
I've got a secret I can't keep inside
Oh touch me
Touch me
You can hear me
So I know you feel me

Well it's not love that I'm lookin' for
(I'm not lookin' around, no)
I just want to be adored
(you heard, you heard)
From the backseat of your car
To the bedroom floor
(h-a-are-m-a-r)

So all you hate-az
Step the f*ck off
I ain't got nothin' but love to ride
Sexy ladies
Dis the hate-az
Cause they ain't no play-az

You can feel me
Sexy body (sexy, sexy)
I've got a secret I can't keep inside
Oh touch me
Touch me (Touch me, touch me, come on touch me)
You can hear me
So I know you feel me

Who's that creepin'
(Sneakin' up)
Ain't that your boyfriend
You didn't say nothin' about no man
(That's not gonna fly)
Well let me meet him
(Shake his hand, say hello)
Congratulate him
On your sexy ass

Um-um-um-um-m

Keep it rockin

Uh

Keep it rockin

Uh Uh

What up?

Hey Har Mar

What's goin' on?

All you hate-az
What? What?
Step the f*ck off
I ain't got nothin' but love to ride
Sexy ladies
Dis the hate-az
Cause they ain't no play-az
(they ain't no Har Mar)

You can feel me
Sexy body
I've got a secret I can't keep inside
Oh touch me
Touch me (Touch me, touch me)
You can hear me
So I know you feel me
(and I know you feel me
And I know you feel me...)

(Masterfully executed "feel me" chaos)
