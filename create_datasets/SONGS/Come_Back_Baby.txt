Oh come back, baby
Baby please don't go, yeah
'Cause the way I love you
You'll never know
Come back baby
Let's talk it over, yeah one more time
Oh oh, yeah

Well I admit, baby (yes I admit)
That I was wrong (that I was wrong)
Don't you know, baby (don't you know baby)
You've been gone too long (gone too long)
Come back baby
Let's talk it over, he, he, one more time

And it won't be long, no, no (one day soon)
You gonna look for me, yeah
And I'll be gone

Like a mountain jack
People must learn how to give
Call my baby back

Baby, just one more time
Oh, one more time
Yeah one more time
