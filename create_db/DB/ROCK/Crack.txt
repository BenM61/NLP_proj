Where did it go? storm of love.
Thunder of flesh, hurricane of blood.
Hail of sweat. the cleansing rain
Used to come lick their pain.
Fingers search the private space.
Promise fills your face.
Treasure chest, beautiful back,
Kiss every crack.
Sit around the fame.
Crack
Slowly I became.
Crack
I'll do it, I'll do
Anything you tell me to.
Stick it on or stick it through.
Anything you want me to.
Any ship, put through
Any port I'm coming to
Anything you tell me to...
Where did it go? storm of love.
Thunder of flesh, hurricane of blood.
Hail of sweat. the cleansing rain
Used to come lick their pain.
Sit around the fame.
Crack
Slowly I became.
Crack
Fingers search the private space.
Promise fills your face.
Treasure chest, beautiful back,
Kiss, kiss every crack.
Kiss, kiss every crack.
