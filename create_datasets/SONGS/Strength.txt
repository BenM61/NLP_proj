This night is mine alone but
All that I can do is taken from me
By something that I feel
My head is clear, my eyes are dry

But still there is something going through me
It's something all too real
Look around and hear the sound of things
That I can use to help me now

But I lack the strength
To walk alone
To stay away
From the telephone

It's much too hard
To fight my day
From day to day
And preserve my isolation and purity

So here I am, I've worked so hard
I've worked so long to be free of her
And still I'm not all here
And I can hear her pain resounding now

But still I'm living through her
I want to have her near
Come back down and look around
At broken thing she's spread out on the ground

But I lack the strength
To walk alone
To stay away
From the telephone

It's much too hard
To fight my day
From day to day
And preserve my isolation and purity

Come back down and look around
At broken thing she's spread out on the ground
Look around and hear the sound of things
That I can use to help me now

Come back down and look around
At broken thing she's spread out on the ground
But I lack the strength
To walk alone

To stay away
From the telephone
It's much too hard
To fight my day

From day to day
And preserve my isolation and purity
