I'm in love with you baby

I'm in love with you baby
just let me ride in your automobile
cause i know oyu got a good little car
but you got too many drivers at your wheel

now listen to me baby
you can;t do this to me
you said you had onme driver
now you got two or three


you got 2 drivers in the daytime
2 drivers at night
you no there aint no way 2 drivers are gonna trat you right

I chech the oil baby
the oil was low
when I cheched you battery
the horn wouldn't even blow


you sad you wanted to know baby
to know how I feel
well put one leg around me darling
and the other one around the wheel
