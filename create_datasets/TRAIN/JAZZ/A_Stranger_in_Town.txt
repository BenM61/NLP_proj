Just arrived on the seven-ten
Thought I'd see the old gang again
But you know how they come and go
I'm just a stranger in town

Everywhere, everyone I see
Seems to wonder who I can be 
And I swear no-one seems to care
About a stranger in town!

I saw a cottage on a lonely old street
The weeds have grown round the gate
Somehow I felt that you would wait here my sweet
But it looks like I'm too late

Guess I'll leave on the twelve-o-two
Can't believe that there's no more you
Is there nothing for me, will I always be
A stranger in my own home town?

Guess I'll leave on the twelve-o-two
Can't believe that there's no more you!
Is there nothing for me, will I always be
A stranger in my own home town?

It hurts to be alone
With no-one of your own
When you're a stranger in your own home town!
