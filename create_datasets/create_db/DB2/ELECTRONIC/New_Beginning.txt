Seven Years I've waited
Seven years of holding on
Yes it's been
Yes it's been
Always kept my faith in
Always know this day would come
Let everybody know

I've made up my mind
It's time for a new beginning
I'm livin' my life
It's time for a new beginning

There's a new day comin'
Getting ready for a change
Yes I am
Yes I am
Gotta keep on runnin'
Gotta be a better way
Yes there is
Yes there is
Gotta do what's in your heart
Say what's on your mind
Everybody
Gotta keep you to myself
I feel now that it's my time
That everybody knows

I've made up my mind
It's time for a new beginning
I'm livin' my life
It's time for a new beginning 

It's time for a new beginning
Yeah...

I've made up my mind
It's time for a new beginning
I'm livin' my mind
It's time for a new beginning

Come on,Come on
There's gotta be a better way
Come on,Come on
There's gotta be a better way
