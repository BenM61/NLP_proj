Bryant Hotel
Cardboard ceilings and mayhem
Nobody cares, hours for sale
Broadway Harlequin harem foot of the stairs

It's a sunny day
But through your window all the world looks gray
The cleaning lady didn't show today
Or so they say, but then you never can tell

Bryant hotel
Fossils lie in the lobby
Biding their time midsummer hell
Sink-down sofa, seat shabby, fifty cent wine

It's a sunny day
But through your window all the world looks gray
A month of dear belated bills to pay but that's okay
They never had it so well at the Bryant Hotel

At the Bryant Hotel, my mama
Bryant Hotel

Bryant Hotel
Elevator vacation
Hourly ride telephone call
Find another location, credit denied

It's a sunny day
But through your window all the world looks gray
The cleaning lady didn't show today
Or so they say, but then you never can tell

At the Bryant Hotel
Bryant Hotel now my pretty mama
At the Bryant Hotel, now
Come on baby at the Bryant Hotel
Bryant, Bryant Hotel mama
Oh, Bryant Hotel now my pretty mama

Come on down
(Incomprehensible)
Come on down pretty baby, oh yeah, yeah
