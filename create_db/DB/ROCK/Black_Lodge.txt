Worship the ground you barely walk on
You give of yourself but your angels are gone
Deny your body is screaming
But your heart and your soul they're bleeding
Just to fall asleep is a godsend
Until your demons appear again

I am a witness to your demise

Your biggest secret is one you can't keep
Lift up your head if you're only asleep
You try to hold onto reason
Why can't you see that you're leaving?
My love for you knows no distance
But it can't fight your resistance

I am a witness to your demise
I am the one who saw through the lies

Give me the one thing you can't give
Take me to the black lodge where you live

Deny your body is screaming
But your heart and your soul they're bleeding
Just to fall asleep is a godsend
Until your demons appear again

I am a witness to your demise
I am the one who saw through the lies
My love has always been blind
