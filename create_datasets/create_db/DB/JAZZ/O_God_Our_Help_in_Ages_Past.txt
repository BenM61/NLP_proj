O God our help in ages past. 
Our hope for years to come. 
Our shelter from the stormy blast 
And our eternal home. 

Before the hills in order stood 
And earth received her frame, 
From everlasting Thou art God, 
To endless years the same. 

Our help, our help, in ages past

O God our help in ages past, 
Our hope for years to come. 
Be Thou our guard while life shall last, 
And our eternal home. 

Our home, our home, our home, our home, 
O God, lead us, guide us, we pray.
