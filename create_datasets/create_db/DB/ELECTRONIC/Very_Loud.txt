I wanna build
Buildings high for you
But of course
I gotta cause I can't afford you
But I always take the wrong way
This is why this love can't stay

And I wanna change
Change the way we always had
And to make different plans
And try not to make this sad
And I always choose another way
This is why this love can't stay

Little by little
You're gonna hear me cry
Hear me cry
Why?

I wanna smell
Smell the way you do
And to wear those clothes
The clothes your friends do
But I always choose another way
This is why this love can't stay

Little by little
You're gonna hear me cry
Hear me cry
Why?
And I know that it started somewhere
And I really like it now
Yes I really like it now
Like it now

I gotta plan
A plan to get us out of here
If we only can use your money
We could definitely get out of here
But I always screw it up some way
This is why this love can't stay

Little by little
You're gonna hear me cry
Hear me cry
Why?
And I know that it started somewhere
And I really like it now
Yes I really like it now
I like it now
And every note that started
Yeah it started from there
And you were very loud
Yeah you were very loud
And I really like that
Like that like that
Yeah you were very loud
