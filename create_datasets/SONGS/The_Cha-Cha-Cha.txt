Baby, baby come on sway me, drive me crazy
Do the cha cha cha
Somethin's missin' when we're twistin', let's start kissin'
Do the cha cha cha.

And when you see the Wah-watusi you'd go a'ha ha ha
The Hully Gully isn't nothin'
When you compare it to the cha cha cha
So oh baby come on sway me, drive me crazy

Do the cha cha cha, come on and sing it now
(more la la la's)
Mmmm let's start kissin', do the cha cha cha
The Locomotion in the ocean and I go ha-ha-ha

The Mashed Potatoes ain't the greatest
When you compare it to the cha cha cha
So oh baby come-a come-a sway me, drive me crazy
Do the cha cha cha--- and let me hear it again

(final la la la's) fade
