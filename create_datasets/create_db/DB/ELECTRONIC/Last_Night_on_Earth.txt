She feels the ground is giving way
But she thinks we're better off that way
The more you take the less you feel
The less you know the more you believe
The more you have the more it takes today
You gotta give it away
You gotta give it away
You gotta give it away
You gotta give it away
You gotta give it away

Well she doesn't care what it's worth
She's living like it's the last night on earth
The last night on earth

She's not waiting on a savior to come
She's at a bus stop with the News of the World
And the Sun
Sun here it comes
She's not waiting for anyone

You gotta give it away
You gotta give it away
You gotta give it away
You gotta give it away
You gotta give it away
You gotta give it away

Well she knows just what it's worth
She's living like it's the last night on earth
Last night on earth

Slipping away
Slip slide
Too many slipping away
The world turns and we get dizzy
Slipping away

She's living, living next week now
You know she's gonna to pay you back somehow
She hasn't been to bed in a week
She'll be dead soon, then she'll sleep

You gotta give it away
You gotta give it away
You gotta give it away
You gotta give it away
You gotta give it away

She already knows it hurts
She's living like it's the last night on earth
The last night on earth
Last night on earth
Last night on earth
