Take me to the promised land
Unleash me, why am I standing here
Yeah I really do believe that
There's more than just this universe, than you and me

Back up in the corner
She telling me, telling me
Don't you cross the border
She stopping me, blocking me

You're a diamond in the rough
I can't fight the feeling
You're a diamond I can't touch
I can't fight the dreaming
You're a diamond in the rough, ooh
You're a diamond in the rough, ooh-ooh-ooh

Prince among thieves
You're a needle in a haystack
Please follow me
I won't ever dare go back
She begging on the phone
But I'm done with all that
Prince among thieves
You're a needle in a haystack

Back up in the corner
She telling me, telling me
Don't you cross the border
She stopping me, blocking me

You're a diamond in the rough
I can't fight the feeling
You're a diamond I can't touch
I can't stop the dreaming
You're a diamond in the rough, ooh
You're a diamond in the rough, ooh-ooh-ooh

You're the type that never rust, ooh-ooh-ooh
You're more than just gold dust, ah, ah, ah

You're a diamond in the rough
I can't fight the feeling
You're a diamond I can't touch
I can't fight the dreaming
You're a diamond in the rough, ooh
You're a diamond in the rough

You're a diamond in the rough, oh oh oh oh
