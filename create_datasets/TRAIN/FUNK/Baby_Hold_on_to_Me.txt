All your friends are telling you
You should have a fancy car and diamond rings
But girl you know all good things come in time

Girl you know I'll do just about anything (anything)
To see a smile (to see a smile) upon your face (upon your face)
So don't let your friends go messing 
With your mind (oh no)

And girl you know 
There ain't nothing I won't do for you 
And baby don't
Don't ever doubt my love 'cause it's true

Baby hold on to me
See I'm a special kind
A man that is hard to find
Told you a thousand times
Baby hold on to me

Baby hold on to me
See I'm a special kind (hold me with all your tight)
A man that is hard to find

Oh girl wasn't I there 
When he made you cry
And who was there to comfort you
When he said bye bye bye bye bye baby

Girl I give you my time 
Here is my money
All of my heart and 
You'll be so sorry baby
If we were to ever part, part
And girl you know
That I would never hurt you
Oh girl you know
That I would never desert you
