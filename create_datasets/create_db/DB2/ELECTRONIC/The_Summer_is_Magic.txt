You are holding her so tight
Finally she's yours
The summer's giving you more
And everything's alright

Now your full lips are meeting
What an adventure is
You're gonna tell your best friends
You're gonna wake up singin'

The summer is magic
Is magic
Oh oh oh 
The summer is magic
You have to imagine
Imagine
Oh oh oh 
The summer is magic

In the disco hours after
She waves her hands no speech
She gets you with her from the beach
And burst into laughter

She is dancing with the dee jay
You fix yourself a drink
And so what do you think?
Ain't it a lovely day?

The summer is magic
Is magic
Oh oh oh 
The summer is magic
You have to imagine
Imagine
Oh oh oh 
The summer is magic

Summer is a magic thing live it happy don't be tragic
Is it logic that you want it
Try to catch it play it magic 

Summer is a magic thing sing it loudly do not panic 
Try to sing it don't be tragic
Live it happy summer tragic

The summer is magic
Is magic
