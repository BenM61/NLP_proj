Back back back in the back of your mind
Are you learning an angry language
Tell me boy boy boy are you tending to your joy
Or are you just letting it vanquish
Back back back in the dark of your mind
Where the eyes of your demons are gleaming
Are you mad mad mad
About the life you never had
Even when you are dreaming

Who are these old old old people
In these nursing homes
Scowling away at nothing
Like big rag dolls just cursing at the walls 
And pulling out all of their stuffing
Ever day is a door leading back to the core
Yes, old age will distill you
And if you're this this this full of bitterness now
Some day it will just fill you

When you sit right down in the middle of yourself
You're gonna want to have a comfortable chair
So renovate your soul before you get too old 
'cause you're gonna be housebound there
When you're old you fold up like an envelope 
And you mail yourself right inside
And there's nowhere to go
Except out real slow
Are you ready, boy, for that ride?

Your arrogance is gaining on you
And so is eternity
You better practice happiness
You better practice humility
You took the air, you took the time
You were fed and you were free
Now you'd better put some beauty back
While you got the energy
You'd better put some beauty back, boy
While you got the energy
