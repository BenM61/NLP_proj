Yeah
Come on to me babe, let me be your lover
Let's do all the things lovers do
We can kiss and hug honey

All night on the rug, that daddy back in Texas gave to you
Thinkin' 'bout the time we was messing people's minds
Together doin' what we wanted to
But that was the best part

Like we had a head start, you lovin' me and me lovin' you 
So let's do it over again
And let's don't let it end
I found what I want and it's you

A woman, lover, friend
So let's do it over again
Let's don't let it end
I found what I want and it's you

A woman, lover, friend
Come on to me babe, let me be your lover
Let's do all the things lovers do
We can kiss and hug honey

All night on the rug, that your daddy back in Texas gave to you
Thinkin' 'bout the time we was messing people's minds
Together doin' what we wanted to
But that was the best part

Like we had a head start, you lovin' me and me lovin' you 
Oh Yeah, you lovin' me and me lovin' you 

Do it over again
Do it over again
Do it over and over again
Do it, do it, do it again
Do it over again
Do it over again
Do it over and over again...
