The more I touch you 
The more I want your warm caress
The more I see you
Is more days I have of happiness

The more I kiss you 
The more I thrill inside
And I want more and more and more of you

The more I hear your voice
The more loving that it sounds
The more I'm with you 
The more I want to be around
The more that you hold me
The more secure that I feel

And I know more and more this love of ours is really real
We don't have to say we'll climb the highest mountain
We don't have to say we'll swim the deepest sea
'Cause with a love like ours that's really real, really real
We don't have to lie about impossibilities

The more of the many pleasures darling that we share give me more happy memories
In the hours you cannot be here
The more I think of you
The more I don't want to forget
And the more we we see each other
The more we're like lovers that just met
