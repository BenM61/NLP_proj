Little Pal, if Daddy Goes away
Promise you'll be good from day to day
Do as Mother says and never sin
Be the man your Daddy might have been
Your Daddy didn't have an easy start
So this is the wish that's in my heart

What I couldn't be, Little Pal
I want you to be, Little Pal
I want you to laugh and to sing and to play
And be good to Mother while Daddy's away

Each night how I'll pray, Little Pal
That you'll turn out right, Little Pal
So till we meet again
Heaven knows where or when
Pray for me now and then, Little Pal
