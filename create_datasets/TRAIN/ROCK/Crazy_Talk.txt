She talks crazy talk
She talks crazy talk
She talks crazy talk
She could make a man a ruin

She talks crazy talk
She'll tell ya anything
She talks crazy talk
She could give a man the ruin

And if you fall for her lies
In a while, you will find
You can dance, you can sing
Like a puppet on a string
But you ain't in control of a single thing

She talks crazy talk
She talks crazy talk
She'll tell ya anything
She could make a man a ruin

She talks mumbo jumbo
Monkey on your back
She talks crazy talk
She could make a man a ruin

And if you fall for her lies
In a while, you will find
You can dance, you can sing
Like a puppet on a string
But you ain't in control of a single thing

She talks crazy talk
She don't mean a word she says
She talks crazy talk
She could make a man a ruin

She talks crazy talk, mumbo jumbo
Monkey on your back
She talks crazy talk
She could make a man a ruin

She talks crazy talk, mumbo jumbo
Monkey on your back
She talks crazy talk
She could make a man a ruin
