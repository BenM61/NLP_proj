I know that I can't be a few
I'll be myself
Be myself

I'm told to be over the moon
I can teach myself
Teach myself

But I'm old, I can feel that it's true
I believe myself
Believe myself

And I know it'll be over soon
I can see myself
See myself

(See myself, see myself)
See myself
(See myself, see myself)
See myself

I'm trapped, but I'm trapped in the booth
I can free myself
Free myself

Then I'll talk but you know there's no use
I can hear myself
Hear myself

The road's blocked, I can tell that we've stopped
Probably lead myself
Will lead myself

And I know if I'm moving on up
I will be myself
Be myself

(Be myself, be myself)
Be myself
(Be myself, be myself)
Be myself
(Be myself, be myself)
Be myself
(Be myself, be myself)
Be myself
