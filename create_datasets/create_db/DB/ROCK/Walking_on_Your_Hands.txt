People, are you walking on your hands
Well, they've had you on your knees once
But you still don't understand
Are you walking on your hands

Are you walking on your hands
You'll know just exactly where you stand
'Cause if you try to move your feet
It might not quite be how you planned

Oh are you walking on your hands
Are you walking on your hands
Are you walking on your hands
Are you walking on your hands

Will you get yourselves up off the ground
'Cause if you're crawling on that floor
Perhaps you just might understand
Oh are you walking on your hands

Are you walking on your hands
Are you walking on your hands
Are you walking on your hands
