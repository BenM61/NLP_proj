You just made the worst mistake
And you'll regret it, darling
'Cause once you give and then you take
You'll only end up wanting

Uh uh uh 
Was everything hard enough?
Uh uh uh 
'Cause one day you'll wake up, and then you'll say

I wanna be your lover
I don't wanna be your friend
You don't know what you got 'til it's gone my dear
So tell me that you love me again (tell me that you love me)
I, I wanna be your lover
Baby, I'll hold my breath
You don't know what you got 'til it's gone my dear
So tell me that you love me again (tell me that you love me)

Again, babe, again
Again, babe, again
You don't know what you got 'tll it's gone my dear
So tell me that you love me again

Ooh, she's screaming in my head
Ooh, I left her where I slept
Somewhere I can't escape, I'm running from myself
Somewhere in between in love and broken, I'm in hell

Saying, "I wanna be your lover, I don't wanna be your friend"
You don't know what you got 'til it's gone my dear
So tell me that you love me again (tell me that you love me)
I, I wanna be your lover
You'll leave when the clock hits ten
You don't know what you got 'til it's gone my dear
So tell me that you love me again (tell me that you love me)

Again, babe, again
Again, babe, again
You don't know what you got 'til it's gone my dear
So tell me that you love me again (tell me that you love me)
Again, babe, again
Again, babe, again
You don't know what you got 'til it's gone my dear
So tell me that you love me again (tell me that you love me again, again, again, again)
