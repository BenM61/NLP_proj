Another Friday night
Another tired line

Baby, you sure look good,
Hey baby, what's your sign?
How many ask for your number
Before they even know your name?
How many out there tired of playing
This silly o-old time game?

Hey, and when the lights go down
And it's justa you to
It's when you and your lover, yeah
Do what (...wanna) do

That's when you feel the heat
Hotter than July
That's when you and your baby, baby, baby
When your baby get a ride
Yeah, when your baby get a ride

How can you tell him no
When he loves you so?
Buy you anything
Anything you want
His eyes all aglow
He'll know you're good to go
Duh-dun
Duh-dun
Duh-dun
In front of a restaurant, yeah

Girl, you'd better know
Really, until you do it couple o' times in a row
It's just the same
It's just a game
Go back to do whatever, sleep outside your door

When the lights go down, yeah
And it's just you to
That's when you hear the sounds
Of what true lovers do, yeah
And when you feel the heat, yo
Hotter than July
That's when you and your baby
When your baby get a ride
Yeah, hey, and when your baby get a ride now

Then when your baby get a ride

That's when your baby get a ride
That's when your baby play with you tonight
