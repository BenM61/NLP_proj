You annihilated this week
Now it's Sunday and you weep
A future of fun
Or a guilt loaded run
Your carnal desires
Fanning the fires
You're really burnin' 'em up
Partying n' such

*(x4)
Annihilate
Annihilate
All week long

You never think that hard
Til the devil's in your backyard
But she can't quite forget
That night in my corvette
Annihilating the week
Sledge hammers to the street
But then on Sunday
You're looking mighty weak

*(x4)

**
I'm a smokin' and drinkin' thing
(you're a regular social machine)
I'm a smokin' and drinkin' thing
(you're a radical partyin' machine)

 Annihilating this week
Screwing everything that you meet
She thinks she's feeling better
But her conscience won't let her
Your thoughts temporarily deceived
But your virginity can't be retreived
You never had it before
And now you can't close the door

*(x4)

Annihilate
Annihilate
Annihilate
Annihilate
Annihilate
Annihilate
Annihilate
