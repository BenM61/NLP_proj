Come on in to my kitchen
Sit down on the floor
Come on in, come on in
It's going to be raining outdoors
Come on in to my parlor
Said the spider to the fly
Come on in, come on in
You can have a little fun before you die

You know I want you
You want me too
Come on in
I'll tell you what to do
You got to come on in to my boudoir
Well turn the lights down low
Come on in, come on in
I'll show you everything I know

You know I want you
You want me too
Come on in
I'll tell you what to do
You got to come on in to my boudoir
Well turn the lights down low
Come on in, come on in
I'll show you everything I know

I said come on in, come on in
I'll show you everything
I'll show you everything
I'll show you everything I know
