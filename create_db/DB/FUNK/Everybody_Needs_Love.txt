Say you wanna be loved
But you won't let me love you
Say you want someone to trust in you, baby
Can't you see that's what I'm tryin' to do?

I know you've been hurt before
And you're afraid to try love once more

Without love by your side
You're only half alive
'Cause everybody needs love, oh, yeah
Everybody needs love

Say you wanna be kissed
But you won't let me kiss you
Say you wanna be missed
Can't you see how my arms are missing you?

She's got you hurting so inside
Now, with love you try to hide

But no matter how you try
Without love you can't survive
'Cause everybody needs love, oh, yeah
Everybody needs love, oh, love's alright

You need love, I need love, everybody needs love
Baby, don't you know that?
You need love and I need love
Everybody needs love

Say you wake up in the morning, yes, you will
Feeling, ooh, so empty inside
I bet I know what your trouble is, baby
You need someone like me by your side

I know you've been hurt before
But don't be afraid to try love once more

'Cause without love you'll find
You'll have no peace of mind
'Cause everybody needs love, oh, yeah
Everybody needs love

You need love
I need love
Everybody needs love
