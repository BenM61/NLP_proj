For you, my love, I'd do most anything,
For you, my love, I'd do most anything,
I love you baby, and I hope you feel the same!

For you, my love, I'd swim the ocean blue,
For you, my love, I'd swim the ocean blue,
There's nothing in this world that I wouldn't do for
You!

Let's go out tonight and celebrate,
I've a party plan for you that just won't wait!
For you, my love, I'd do most anything,
I love you baby, and I hope you feel the same!

You made me drink, you made me dream,
Changed my drink to milk and cream1
I said goodbye to all the mob,
I even went out and got a job!
For you, my love, I'd do most anything,
I love you baby, and I hope you feel the same!
