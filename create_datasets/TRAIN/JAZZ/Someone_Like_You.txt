The voice is real.
For me to hear.
But I can't say,
That I'm okay
So I lay down.
In front of you.
To work this through.

I needed someone just like you.
I needed you.
I needed someone just like you.
I needed you, to stay.

So I'll stand by.
And watch you slide.
But I can't hide,
The pain inside.
So I lay down.
One more time.
To say I tried.

Then you leave.
When I needed someone to stay.
You were my friend.
'cause I need you.
And I wanted you to stay.

I needed someone just like you.
I needed you.
I needed someone just like you.
I needed you, to stay.
