I wanna make my home
Where the buffalo roam
In that great panorama

My baby brother and me
In the land of the free
Americana

In my schoolboy world
I always get the girl
On that great silver screen
'Cause since I was a teen
Ya' know I had this dream
Americana
Oh

Runnin' high on inspiration
Taken from those Wild West heroes
Full of expectations of the road
On that windin' trail to somewhere
Young and foolish though he did not care
What dangers lay in store and so

In the steps of the great pioneers
For [inaudible]
I can't understand how I'm gonna
Get there from here
Wherever it goes, it's gonna take me somewhere

Americana
Americana

Kentucky moon
Montana sky
Sierra Nevada

It's an empty drive
But it's a long long time
Americana
Oh

I wanna make my home 
Where the buffalo roam
Oh
