Let's get to bed early
Sneak out right before the sunrise
We don't need all the goodbyes
We won't be gone for long
Oh, baby, don't worry
I hid away a little money
We don't need much, honey
Enough just to get us home

Let's don't wait til love comes undone

There's life to be lived
And stories to tell
Lessons to learn
We don't know yet
Nothing to lack, looking back
Knowing that we have lived it well
With stories to tell

What about California
LA out by the seaside?
Watch the sun turn to moonlight
Then stay up and talk til dawn
Maybe Carolina
Hide out up in the mountains
A week or two, no one's counting
Come back before too long

We won't wait til love comes undone

There's life to be lived
And stories to tell
Lessons to learn
We don't know yet
Nothing to lack, looking back
Knowing that we have lived it well
With stories to tell

The sea and the cities
The runway lights
The highway humming
Staying awake all night
How all those mountains
Turned to desert sand
Let's just disappear
Come on baby, take my hand

There's life to be lived
And stories to tell
Lessons to learn
We don't know yet

There's life to be lived
And stories to tell
Lessons to learn
We don't know yet
Nothing to lack, looking back
Knowing that we have lived it well
With stories to tell

The sea and the cities
The runway lights
The highway humming
Staying awake all night
How all those mountains
Turned to desert sand
Let's disappear
