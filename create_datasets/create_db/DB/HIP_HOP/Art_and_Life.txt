Haili king Selassie bless I

Mi seh eyes a rasta man rise Selassie banner
From mi a yute reggae music mi inna
Tell yuh di truth nuh other work mi nuh prefer
Can't change bulb nor mi caan patch tire
But yuh hand mi a mic di whole dance ketch a fire
Hear dagger tune weh di dj a mutter
As a ghetto yute rise up and stop suffer
Driving a path fancy yuh fall down mi ladder
But instead a man a go ban mi rise up fi di better
And his funeral mi seh

Be strong and help another brother man

Height on that ghetto yute ya look upon
Clean heart and good meditation

All man shall reap what they sow
All what big man boast all baby should know

Sing it and have it set a nasty craze
Now I reach a state
