Born too late to feel the golden age
Missed the rush, the lights of better days
You cut me down to size with wise words
And turn around
Gonna feel, gonna touch, gonna hold the things you had

Don't hold back

Won't feel the times you had
I can't touch your precious past
But I'll live, I'll live, I'll live
I'll live those days tonight

You claim your history
Is beyond a man like me
But I'll live, I'll live, I'll live
I'll live those days tonight

Face the ghost the keeps me on the ground
Take the best of what they talk about
In the cold outside we're waiting
To embrace the nights and pull it close
I'm gonna feel the love you had

Don't hold back 

Won't feel the times you had
I can't touch your precious past
But I'll live, I'll live, I'll live
I'll live those days tonight 

You claim your history
Is beyond a man like me
But I'll live, I'll live, I'll live
I'll live those days tonight 

I live those days, live those dreams, like they're all mine
I hold them close inside
I live those days, live those dreams, like they're all mine
I won't let them hold me back

Won't feel the times you had
I can't touch your precious past
But I'll live, I'll live, I'll live
I'll live those days tonight

You claim your history
Is beyond a man like me
But I'll live, I'll live, I'll live
I'll live those days tonight
