I need someone's hand, to lead me through the night
I need someone arms to hold and squeeze me tight
When the night begins an' the dew remains
I need your love so bad
I need some lips to feel next to mine
I need someone to stand up an' tell me, when I'm lyin'
When the lights are low, an' it's time to go
I need your love so bad

So give it up an' bring it home to me
Or write it on a paper, so it can be read to me
Tell me you love me an' stop drivin' me mad
'Cause I need your love so bad

I need a soft voice that will talk to me at night
Don't worry baby, we won't fuss an' fight
Listen to my plea, bring it home to me
I need your love so bad

Ooh, I need your love so bad-yeah.
