I dig you, baby, I dig you, yes, I do
I dig you, baby, I dig you, yes, I do

Every man when he's young and free
Gets hung up on some new chick he meets
Though it doesn't usually last too long
Little girl, your love is strong

I have to say
(I dig you, baby)
I think I like you, darling
(I dig you, yes, I do)
I really love you, baby
(I dig you, baby)
Yes, I do
(I dig you, yes, I do)

You're that special kind of girl
That makes a guy feel like he rules the world
You add that special something to my day
Lord knows you make it so easy to say

I dig you, baby
(I dig you, baby)
I wanna testify
(I dig you, yes, I do)
I really, really love you, baby
(I dig you, baby)
Yes, I do

Now you are my inspiration
And I dig your hip conversation
The way you smile, oh, that's outta sight
And everything you do, girl, it's all right

(I dig you, baby)
Do I have to say anymore
(I dig you, yes, I do)
I really, love you, love you, baby
(I dig you, baby)
Yes, I do
(I dig you, yes, I do)

Oh, I dig you, baby
(I dig you, baby)
Tell the whole wide world
