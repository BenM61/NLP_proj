As I fall, 

Drunken through vodka... 
As I fall, 

Drunken through vodka & cola 
Chard's of glass burning the back of my head 
As I turn red 
All out war 
Each one get on the floor 
Red so hot 
Follow the middle son 
Concrete jump 
Makes a boy look like a drunken...grrrr..ass! 
Everytime I cross the line, I, 
Go, just leave me alone, 
I'll get by on my own, 
This whole world is our's, 
So let's take it. 
Scrape the plate 
Trust you a little bit 
Face so fucked..... 
Scrape the plate, 
Trust you a little bit, 
Face so fucked, blow out your leg, Yeah 
Spinning Lies, 
Make the man feel like he can't meet a superstar. 
Take a hit, 
Let the burn flow over you, 
Flow excel, 
Expand inside of you, 
Cut your throat, 
That'll be crazy now.... 
HA HA! 
Everytime I cross the line, I, 
Go, just leave me alone, 
I'll get by on my own, 
This whole world is our's, 
So let's take it. 
Gargled lyrics 
Everytime I cross the line 
I push the boundaries out a little... 
Go, just leave me alone, 
(Everytime I cross the line) 
I'll get by on my own, 
(I push the boundaries out a little) 
This whole world is our's, 
So let's take it.
