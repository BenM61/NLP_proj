When you've grown up, my dears
And are as old as I
You'll often ponder on the years
That roll so swiftly by, my dears
That roll so swiftly by

And all the many lands
You will have journeyed through
You'll oft recall, the best of all
The land your childhood knew
Your childhood knew

Toyland, Toyland
Little girl and boy land
While you dwell within it
You are ever happy then

Childhood, joyland
Mystic merry Toyland
Once you pass its borders
You can ne'er return again
