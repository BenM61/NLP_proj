One time you were my baby chicken 
Now you've grown into a fox 
Once upon a time I was your little rooster 
But am I just one of your cocks

It's rough justice on ya 
You're going to have to trust me 
It's rough justice 
But you know I'll never break your heart 

So put your lips to my hips, baby 
And tell me what's on your mind 
I know you've still got the animal attraction for me 
It's been a long, long time 

It's rough justice on ya 
We never thought it risky
It's rough justice 
But you know I'll never break your heart

You're feeling loose and lusty 
So if you really want me 
Yeah, it's rough justice 
And you know I'll never break your heart, yeah 

It's rough justice on ya 
You think you really sussed me 
It's rough justice 
But you know I'll never break your heart 

The first time I saw you, baby 
You were springing like a young gazelle 
And next thing I know, way down the road 
You had me flying like a bat out of hell 

It's rough justice on ya 
Your eyes are too disgusted 
You're going to have to trust me 
But you know I'll never break your heart 

I give you my positions 
Don't want no oppositions 
It's rough justice 
But you know I'll never break your heart 

Yeah
Come on baby
