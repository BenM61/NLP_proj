Starting out of Memphis, highway 61 
Traces of the places where the blues began 
Sun is blazing, horizon far 
Echoes of a national steel guitar 
Down in Mississippi 
Down in Mississippi 
Down in Mississippi 
Down in Mississippi 
Where the blues was born 
Yazoo river rolling through the land 
Cradle of the blues, that delta land 
Cottonfields, catfish farms 
Steady-rocking rhythm since the dawn of time 
Down in Mississippi 
Down in Mississippi 
Down in Mississippi 
Down in Mississippi 
Where the blues was born 
Wade Walton's barbershop, backroom booze 
Shave and a haircut, lots of rhythm 'n blues 
Greenville 
juke joint 
, Saturday night 
Get down 'n boogie till the morning-light 
Down in Mississippi 
Down in Mississippi 
Down in Mississippi 
Down in Mississippi 
Where the blues was born 
Broken down Chevy on a muddy track 
Ten people sharing a two-room shack 
Folks so poor, nothing to loose 
Get religion or that lowdown blues 
Down in Mississippi 
Down in Mississippi 
Down in Mississippi 
Down in Mississippi 
Where the blues was born 
Charly Patton, Fred McDowell, Willie Brown 
Son House, Son Thomas, that delta sound 
Black man's heart, black man's soul 
Bo Diddley, Muddy Waters and Howling Wolf 
Down in Mississippi 
Down in Mississippi 
Down in Mississippi 
Down in Mississippi 
Where the blues was born 
Big Joe Williams, Bukka White, Robert Johnson, Jimmy Reed 
Sam Chatmon, Ishman Bracy, Tommy Johnson, Skip James 
John Lee Hooker, Elmore James, Mississippi John Hurt 
Memphis Minnie, Peetie Wheatstraw, Sonny Boy Williamson 
Down in Mississippi 
Down in Mississippi 
Down in Mississippi 
Down in Mississippi 
Where the blues was born
