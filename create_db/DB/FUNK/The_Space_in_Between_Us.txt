Look at my heart again
Look at the mess I've got it in
I'm trying to trust in You
To know that you'll see me through

Through my pride
Through my shame
Into Your love
Into Your grace

I'm not looking back
Till I see Your face
And I'm running straight to You
Because

All I really want to do is to fall into
The emptiness that is
The space in-between us
To break this division

All I really want to do is to fall into
The emptiness that is
The space in-between us
Erase it and bring us together again

My life's like an open book
Nothing is hidden when you look
You break through my boundaries
Revealing my insecurities

But through my pride
And through my shame
You show me love
You show me grace

I'm not looking back
Till I see your face
And I'm running straight to you
Because

Here I am saying I need you
I know I need you
Here I am, I'm coming to meet you
'Cause I want to see you
