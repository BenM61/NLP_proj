A king is born
I told you before
A king is born
I told you before
A king is born

Oh yeah
Oh no no no no

Like a beast in the jungle
In the heat of the rumble
I ain't got nothing to lose (hey hey hey)
I've been fighting these hard times
In the ghettos of my mind
Now it's victory that I choose (hey hey hey)

Yes, my soul is blessed, the king is born
Mama, I confess, I'm a bad, bad man

Ain't no one like me
I'm a legend
Ain't no one like me
I'm a legend, legend
'Cause I been down so long
And my crown ain't gone, it's destined
Ain't no one like me
I'm a legend, legend, legend

Like a bull in a glass house
No bull, 'bout to smash out
Can't nothing stand in my way
I don't care what the place is
From the penthouse to pavement
Better hear what I say

Yes, my soul is blessed, the king is born
Mama, I confess, I'm a bad, bad man

Ain't no one like me
I'm a legend
Ain't no one like me
I'm a legend, legend
'Cause I been down so long
And my crown ain't gone, it's destined
Ain't no one like me
I'm a legend, legend, legend

A king is born, yeah
I told you before, yeah
A king is born
Been broke before, but I never been broken
Told you before
I am the truth, now the truth has spoken
A king is born
Oh yeah, a king is born, yeah

Oh yeah
Ain't no one like me
I'm a legend
Ain't no one like me
I'm a legend, legend
'Cause I been down so long
And my crown ain't gone, it's destined
Ain't no one like me
I'm a legend, legend, legend
A king is born
