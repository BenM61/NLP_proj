Don't believe a word
You don't believe it
I know what you've heard
I could take it or leave it
I meant it for a minute

Not a second too late
Meant it for a minute
Too weak to wait
You took it like a ticket
You were never meant to take

You know I meant it for a minute
Meant it for a minute

You never took a hint
I never lost a wink of sleep
Don't think I blink the tears back
Every time you walk away
You can snap your fingers 1 2 3
But you can never count on girls like me

Hearts like yours are crack and break
And it's tickin' like a ticket tape
You know I meant it meant it for a minute
Meant it mean it for a minute

You took it right and left
From time to time I lose myself
Can't help I fell
I've left my marbles
On the shelf to roll away
You can count your blessings anyway you please
Standin' on your feet or on your knees

I'm no sweet meant to be
I only meant it for a minute

You know I meant it meant it for a minute
Meant it meant it for a minute
