Yeah three in the morning on the Westside highway, top down baby,
F*ck y'all
The motivation for me is them telling me what I could not be,
Oh well

This a special dedication, (thank y'all)
I wanna thank you for the fuel,
No really thank you

(y'all better hear this shit)
I felt so inspired by what my teacher said,
Said I'd either be dead or be a reefer head,
Now sure if that's how adults should speak to kids,
Especially when the only thing I did was speak in class,
I teach his ass,
Even betters what my uncle did,

I pop my demo tape in, start to beat my head,
Peaked out my eye, see if he was beating his,
He might as well say beat it kid, he's on the list,
Its like I'm searching for kicks like a sneaker head,
He goin' keep pushing me until I reach the ledge,
And when I reach the ledge I'll tell em all to eat a dick,
Take a leap of faith and let my eagle wings spread,
Spread spread spread

The motivation for me is them telling me what I could not be,
Oh well, (hey, hey)
I'm so ambitious, (hey)
I might hit two sisters,
Hey I'm on a mission
No matter what the conditions,
Forget personal issues
When you been what I been through,
Hey if you believe it,
Then you could conceive it

yeah yeah yeah

I had to lace up my boots even harder,
Father is too far away to father,
Further-more are the kids either smoke reefer,
Or either move white, there's few writers in my cipher,
So they made lighter, my type a dreams seem dumb
They said wise up, how many guys a
you see making it from here,
The world don't like us,
is that not clear, alright, but
I'm different, I can't base what I'm gonna be off a what everybody isn't,
They don't listen,
just whispering behind my back,
No vision, lack of ambition,
So wack

The motivation for me is them telling me what I could not be,

No matter what the conditions,

When you been what I been through,
Hey if you believe it,
Then you could conceive it

Had a couple of meetings no offers yet,
Maybe I ain't good enough for these offices,
Back to the drawing board ducking officers,
It's all good cause the streets is A and R'in this,
So with or without any of y'all involvement,
We coming for all of this, respect my conglomerate,
I went from pauper to the President,
Cause every deal I ever made set precedent,
Niggas probably thought I'd fall without old buddy,
Oh buddy, what I do is make more money,
Dear teacher, your probably somewhere near a speaker,
I'm balling outta control, can you hear my sneakers,
F*ck y'all
