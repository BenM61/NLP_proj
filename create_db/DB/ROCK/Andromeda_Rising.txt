The world was dark, he couldn't see the way
Guilt was in his heart
A broken glass in a blood stained hand
A woman with a broken heart
Somehow he knew he'd gotta find a way
Out of this prison cell
He looked up to the familiar skies
For a secret they might tell
Then Orion shone in the coal black night
He saw Andromeda rising
A golden light shone all around
Like the answer he had found
There were tears in his eyes
Like the rainy sky
His past life was an illusion
And he stands, a new born man as he sees Andromeda rising
He left his home and he left his wife
He left his family
But every place that he traveled through
Himself he still could see
Somewhere there's gotta be a place
With no bitter memories
And just at the point he was breaking down
He looked up through the trees
Then Orion shone in the coal black night
He saw Andromeda rising
A golden light shone all around
Like the answer he had found
There were tears in his eyes
Like the rainy sky
His past life was an illusion
And he stands, a new born man as he sees Andromeda rising
Andromeda rising
Andromeda rising
Andromeda rising
Then Orion shone in the coal black night
He saw Andromeda rising
A golden light shone all around
Like the answer he had found
There were tears in his eyes
Like the rainy sky
His past life was an illusion
And he stands, a new born man as he sees Andromeda rising
And he stands, a new born man as he sees Andromeda rising
And he stands, a new born man as he sees Andromeda rising
