Is there anything worth fighting for?
Where do we go but nowhere
I lean against my own restraints
Traffic noise deflect the voices

Felt strewn down but I still ain't
Heading for defeat
Strong in mind
A will to win

I stand my ground
There's a first time for everything
Strong in heart I stalk my path
Narrow minded but oh so wide

Seldom seen a view so clear
Force the enemy on my side
It came so vast
It's all one to me

Struck down my past
It's about time to break free
Heading to win
Strong in mind

A will to win
I stand my ground
Heading for one
Strong in mind

A will to win
I stand my ground
