Didn't we have ourselves some kind of a summer
Didn't we have ourselves some kind of a time
I guess I never took the time to tell you how much I love you
Now you and the road keep flashing through my mind
You and the road keep flashing through my mind

I caught a sunrise service on a Sunday in North Dakota
Imagine you and me singing in a gospel choir
Spent a rainy night on a river in Oklahoma
Saw the northern lights on a Minnesota night
And our souls went a little bit higher

Didn't we have ourselves some kind of a summer
Didn't we have ourselves some kind of a time
I guess I never took the time to tell you how much I love you
Oow, you and the road keep flashing through my mind
You and the road keep flashing through my mind

The old De Soto died on a hill
It couldn't climb in Montana
The kid who bought the wreck said
What the heck, I'll give you a thirty five

So we were on our own
Had our thumbs to take us home to California
By the time we made Denver
With our truck drivin' friend we had wheels on fire

Didn't we have ourselves some kind of a summer
Didn't we have ourselves some kind of a time
I guess I never took the time to tell you how much I love you
Now you and the road keep flashing through my mind
You and the road keep flashing through my mind
You and the road, you and the road on my mind
