'Til the moon deserts the sky
'Til all the seas run dry
'Til then I'll worship you 
'Til the tropic sun grows (turns) cold
'Til this young world grows old

My darling, I'll adore you 
You are my reason to live
All I own I would give
Just to have you adore me 

'Til the rivers flow upstream
'Til lovers cease to dream
'Til then I'm yours, be mine 

You are my reason to live
All I own I would give
Just to have you adore me 

'Til the rivers flow upstream
'Til lovers cease to dream
'Til then I'm yours, be mine
