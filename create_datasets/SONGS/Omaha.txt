Start tearing the old man down
Run past the heather and down to the old road
Start turning the grain into the ground
Roll a new leaf over
In the middle of the night there's an old man
Treading around in the gathered rain
Hey, mister, if you want to walk on water
Oh would you drop a line my way?

Omaha
Somewhere in middle America
Get right to the heart of matters
It's the heart that matters more
I think you'd better turn your ticket in
And get your money right at the door

Oh oh yeah

Start threading the needle
Brush past the shuttle that slides through the cold room
Start turning the wool across the wire
Roll the new life over
In the middle of the night there's an old man
Threading his toes through a bucket of rain
Hey, mister, if you want to walk on water
'Cause you're only going to walk all over me

Omaha
Somewhere in middle America
Get right to the heart of matters
It's the heart that matters more
I think you'd better turn your ticket in
And get your money right at the door

Start running the banner down
Drop past the color come up through the summer rain
Start turning the girl into the ground
Roll a new life over
In the middle of the day 
There's a young man rolling around in the earth and rain
Hey mister if you're going to walk on water, you know
You're only going to walk all over me

Omaha
Somewhere in middle America
Get right to the heart of matters
It's the heart that matters more
I think you'd better turn your ticket in
And get your money right at the door

Omaha
Oh somewhere in middle America
Get right to the heart of matters
Oh it's the heart that matters more
I think you'd better turn your ticket in
And get your money back at the door

Omaha!
Say Omaha on a Sunday morning
I'm coming home today
