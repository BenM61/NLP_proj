Plot twist, I never thought it would end up like this
I always thought it would only be one kiss
One became a hundred
Oh, all of a sudden, I'm saying, "I love you"
Plot twist, everything's happening so quick
I only wanted a taste of your lips
Lips became your body, nights turning to naughty
You hit me with a plot twist (with a plot twist)

I might drive fast, (oh yeah) but don't slow dance (nah uh)
I f*ck all night, I don't really f*ck with romance (nah uh)
I might be hands on (ah ha), but I never hold hands (nah uh)
Since you came into my world
I had to leave that in the past tense

All my life I've been a player, player, player
But I don't wanna play no more
I guess that's the effect you got on me (you got on me)
Somebody better say a prayer, prayer, prayer
For the one I was before
I guess that's the effect you got on me

Don't know what it was, don't know what it was
Baby, turn me up, baby, turn me up
It was only one night, I was in and out
How the f*ck I fall in love? How I fall in love?
Yeah, she got inside
She built a brand new house in my mind
And damn, she already close with my moms
I couldn't even kick her out if I tried
Oh, I had it figured out
How'd she shoot me down?
Now she's moving in
Ah, shit

See, I've never been in love
But I've never been opposed to it
I never really thought I'd ever get this close to it
Where do we take a chance?
You wanna make a go for it
'Cause now you come into my world
I'll chase you 'round the globe for it

All my life I've been a player, player, player
But I don't wanna play no more
