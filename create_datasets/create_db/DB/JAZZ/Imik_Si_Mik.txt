Afousse hou fousse
Wink d'winou ira n'ftou
I will take the train
Leave the sun for the rain
And come downtown
I will spend money and time
Loose friends and cry
More than motherless child
I will come downtown to you now

Leave the sun for the rain

I will spend money and time
Loose friends and cry
More than motherless child
I will come downtown to you now

So baby won't you please open the door
And let me until we can forget all
Just you and me
Forever downtown in the city
My love
My dear
My sweet baby
I need to see
To feel
To breath
Your touch
Your kiss
Your smile
Your lips
I need to see you
Leave the sun for the rain
And come down town
