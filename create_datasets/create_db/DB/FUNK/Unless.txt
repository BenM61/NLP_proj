Careless
I couldn't care less
Careless
I couldn't care less
Careless
I couldn't care less
Such a mess
I know it's useless

I couldn't care less
Careless
I couldn't care less

While my heart keeps returning
I am lost, I am weightless
With my arms by my side
I am hope, I can break this
I am rust, I am waiting
I am here, I am weightless
I am rust, rust, 
Rust
Rust

Careless
I couldn't care less
Careless
I know it's useless
I couldn't care less
Careless
I know it's useless
Careless
Couldn't care less
I know it's you, I guess
Couldn't care less
