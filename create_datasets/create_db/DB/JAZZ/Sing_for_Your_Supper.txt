Hawks and crows do lots of things,
but the canary only sings.
She is a courtesan on wings-
So I've heard.
Eagles and storks are twice as strong.
All the canary knows is song.
But the canary gets along-
Guilded bird!

Sing for your supper,
And you'll get breakfast.
Songbirds always eat
If their song is sweet to hear.

Sing for your luncheon,
And you'll get dinner.
Dine with wine of choice,
If romance is in your voice.

I heard from a wise canary
Trilling makes a fellow willing,
So, little swallow, swallow now.
Now is the time to

Sing for your supper,
And you'll get breakfast.
Songbirds are not dumb,
They don't buy a crumb
Of bread,
It's said.
So sing and you'll be fed.
