I do not agree, this is not for me
No, musical genocide
I will not commit, nor will I submit
To, musical genocide
This is not for me, I won't let it be
No, musical genocide
Give me a blues song, tell the world what's wrong
And the gospel singer, giving those messages of love
Woah, and the soul man, with your heart in the palm of his hand
Singing his stories of love and pain, woah

I do not agree
I do not agree, this is not for me
No, musical genocide
I will not commit, nor will I submit
To, musical genocide
This is not for me, I won't let it be
No, musical genocide
Give me a blues song, tell the world what's wrong
And what about the gospel singer, heavenly messages of love
And woah, and the soul man, with your heart in his hands
Singing his stories of love and pain, woah

I do not agree
I do not agree, I do not agree, no
Hey
I do not agree, this is not for me
Come on come on come on come on come on people
Come on
