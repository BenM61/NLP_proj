Ace on an unbroken line, Ace of Hearts!
Mariner of the time, another Ace of Hearts!
Sweet procession of cards that you take
From each Victorian box that you make!

You break the Ace of Hearts that break too much
The Hearts that cannot be refused on your watch
Break the Ace of Hz!

Draw closer to me, Ace of Hearts!
Aces among the tame, another Ace of Hearts!
Hearts to make yourself free... Yes, you will!
Make free of the cities where time stands still!

You break the Ace of Hearts that break too much
The bombs that cannot be defused by your touch

Break the Ace of Hz!
Break Aces of Hearts!
Break all Aces of Hearts!
