(Let's dance some more) 
(Hey) 

Fantasia erotica (Hey) 
Come into this world 
Fantasia erotica (Hey) 
Girl love boy, love girl 

Today I am free, tomorrow I may not be 
Let's take a trip baby, we'll be so happy 
Open your mind to the power of the body 
Physical love is the name of this party 

Fantasia erotica (Hey) 
Come into this world (He..hey) 
Fantasia erotica (Hey) 
Girl love boy, love girl 

She likes the music that makes her pull up her dress 
He likes to watch as she pumps on her own caress 
Tense like a brick, she rears up on the rocky bed 
It's all he can do not to touch her, he dances instead 

Fantasia erotica (Hey) 
Come into this world 

Oh, speak American? 
No, speak Carmenese 

Erotic is my name 
Make my fantasy your game 
Whatever you wish four me to do 
That's what I'm gonna be doin' four you 
Feel my image comin' alive 
Touch my body, feel my vibe 
Am I real or could I be your erotic fantasy? 

Fantasia erotica (Hey) 
Come into this world (Hey) 

Who could ever know just how far I'd let you go? 
Give you limits? - Don't be silly, I would never tell you no 
A dream to you I seem to be, but yet you're my reality 
So while I'm here four pleasin' you, just be my fantasy 

Take a look inside, I've got nothin' there to hide 
I'm a product of your thought so I know nothing of pride 
Let me tease you just a moment, that's the way I express myself 
I'm puttin' my cards on the table as I undress myself (Hey) 

They drive away in her scarlet 'Bourghini 
Off comes her dress, ooh .. her scarlet bikini 
"Open your mind to the power of the body" 
"Open your mind to the power of the body" 
She says as she disappears and he hears 

Fantasia erotica (Hey) 
Come into this world (Open your mind to the..) 
Fantasia erotica (Hey) 
Girl love boy, love girl (Open your mind to the power of the body)
