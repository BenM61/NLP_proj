When I wake up, I can't stay up 
There's no time for hope 
Mr. Hung out Mr. Torn up 
Looking for the phone 

I'll give you something that you're waiting to see 
I'll give you something that would set you free 

Drink it, drink it, snort it, smoke it 
Every little thing I love about it 
Drink it, drink it, snort it, smoke it 
Yeah 

Drink it, drink it, snort it, smoke it 
Every little thing I love about it 
Drink it, drink it, snort it, smoke it 
Yeah 

Got it crushed up, got it blown up 
Suck it through the straw 
Love is murder, love is further 
Further down the hole 

I'll give you something that you're waiting to see 
I'll give you something that would set you free 

Drink it, drink it, snort it, smoke it 
Every little thing I love about it 
Drink it, drink it, snort it, smoke it 
Yeah 

Drink it, drink it, snort it, smoke it 
Every little thing I love about it 
Drink it, drink it, snort it, smoke it 
Yeah
