Secret kiss reminded me of what I miss
Some kind of forgotten bliss
On this summers eve
Though the seasons deceive

Corrupt my honesty
You still make me believe
Is this the rock?
That you didn't need to cross

Down the river to the docks
That's where we'll meet
Where the pale light creeps
Into her majesty 

You still make me believe
So far away (so far away)
So far away (so far away)
Can't get away (so far away)

So far away
But that's alright
But that's alright
Jewels and pearls

And all the wonders of the world
Mean nothing until I return
In time for tea
Sat on my settee

Lost in my memories
You still make me believe
You make me believe
You make me believe

You make me believe
