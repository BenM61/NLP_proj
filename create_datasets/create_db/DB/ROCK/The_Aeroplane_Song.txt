For today I bought an aeroplane.
I flew away.
All I need now is a name to appraise.
A kind of liturgy, a claim to fame.
Book me a window seat and I closed my eyes and she came.
Does anybody care to see why.
Everybody here's so happy?

Lufthansa go where you want to go.
Lufthansa go where you want to go.
Lufthansa I can't stay.

I dreamed today I boarded a frequent flyer.
And had my wicked way.
Recline a window seat.
I closed my eyes and she came.
But it's uncommon courtesy.
Now everybody here seems happy.

Lufthansa go where you want to go.
Lufthansa go where you want to go.
Lufthansa I can't stay.

Danke fr?ein, sch?scheinwerfer liebchen, auf wiedersehen.
Lufthansa go where you want to go.
Lufthansa go where you want to go.
Lufthansa I can't stay.

Singing auf wiedersehen.
Lufthansa go where you want to go.
Lufthansa go where you want to go.
Lufthansa I can't stay.

Singing auf wiedersehen.
Singing auf wiedersehen.
Singing auf wiedersehen.
Singing auf wiedersehen.
