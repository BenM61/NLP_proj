Hey lady killa, come right in
It's time for you, let the show begin
You're so pretty, dripping sin
(You feelin' it? You feelin' it?)
Your eyes are screaming, I take the stage
A fatal dance, a primal rage
You pray for me, unlock the cage
(You feelin' it? You feelin' it?)

I think you ready, you want a show?
You wanna hear me? Good to go
(Kill, eat the male, kill, eat the male)
(Kill, eat the male, kill, eat the male)
I think you ready, you want a show?
You wanna hear me? Good to go
Love me 'til you're dead, I will not forget
You'll still love me dead or alive
(Dead or alive, dead or alive)
Love me 'til you're dead, this is what you get
You'll still love me, dead or alive
(Dead or alive, dead or alive)
(I-I- you feelin' it?)

So here we are, make your move
We're going mad, I'll help our groove
You want control, I disapprove
(I-I- you feelin' it? You feelin' it?)
So watch me close, as I unveil
I'm stripping down, your face is pale
You are the heart, I am the nail
(I-I- you feellin' it? You feelin' it?)

I think you ready, you want a show?
You wanna hear me? Good to go
(Kills with poison, kills with poison)
(Kills with poison, kills with poison)
I think you ready, you want a show?
You wanna hear me? Good to go
Love me 'til you're dead, you will not forget
You'll still love me dead or alive
(Dead or alive, dead or alive)
Love me 'til you're dead, this is what you get
You'll still love me, dead or alive
(Dead or alive, dead or alive)

Love me 'til you're dead, this is what you get
You'll still love me, dead or alive
(Dead or alive, dead or alive)

Love me 'til you're dead, this is what you get
You'll still love me, dead or alive
(Dead or alive, dead or alive)
