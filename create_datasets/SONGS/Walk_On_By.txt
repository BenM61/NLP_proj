Solitude's my best friend
The only one who sees me cry
It tells me I will never need another man
If I keep my head up
And walk on by

Solitude my best friend
My trust for you will never let me down
Tell me I'll be better off not wondering why
It lifts my head up
And I walk on by

It lets my head up
And I walk on by

Solitude's my best friend
And if I want to cry
It tells me I'll be happier within without
And I should turn my heart off
And stop waste my time

Solitude my best friend
When I ask him why
Tell me I'd be better off not finding out
So I keep my head up
And walk on by

So I keep my head up
And I walk on by

Better not wonder
Better not cry
Better not wonder
Better not cry
Better not wonder
Better not cry
Better not wonder
Better walk by

Better not wonder
Better not cry
Better not wonder
Better not cry
Better not wonder
Better not cry
Better not wonder
Better walk by

It keeps your head up
And I walk on by

Better not wonder
Better not cry
Better not wonder
Better not cry
Better not wonder
Better not cry
Better not wonder
Better walk by
