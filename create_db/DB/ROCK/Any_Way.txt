You can take me away from my sorrow
But you can't take away my scars
I stand in the middle of the highway
Playing chicken with the cars
It's not that I'm destructive I
Just want to feel your pain

Chorus:
If there was any way I could have known
I would trip and fall away from you
If there was anything I could have done
To stay in love with you - with you

I wish I could say to you what you are to me
But I know it would make you sad
You are too good to be my lover
But you've been the greatest dad
I ever had
You made my life so lovely I
Just had to mess it up

If there was any way I could have known
I would always need to be alone
If there was anything I could have done
To stay in love with you
With you

If I knew I'd do it twice just to make sure that
I did it right

If there was any way I could have known
I would always need to be alone
If there was anything I could have done
To stay in love with you
With you
