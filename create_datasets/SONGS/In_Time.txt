There's a mickie in the tastin' of disaster
In time you get faster
(In time)
Harry Hippie is a waste as if
He hasta procrastanatin'

Something moving in the brain of a doer
In time feel a little newer
(In time)
I switched from coke to pep and I'm a connoisseur
Um hum
(About time)

'Cause there's a method in the madness of the thinkin'
In time, oh, we oughta
(In time)
It seems the best of all the sadness is a sinkin'
In time muddy water
(In time)

And there's a wreck yard in the mind of a quitter
In time gonna get bitter
(In time)
He don't give a heck or is he blind and makin' litter
In time gonna need a baby sitter
(About time)

I felt so good I told the leader how to follow
In time get down
(In time)
So glad I could not feel indeed so very hollow
No need to follow

Insecurities attracting every flirter
In time, yeah, it's murder
(In time)
If you don't mind please why give slack to a deserter
(About time)

Well, well, well, well, well, oh, day light is all I see
Ah, stay light away from me
See you tomorrow noon
(Miss me, I'll see you soon)

I told you it's not the teachin' it's the learnin'
In time don't need no burnin'
(In time)
And when I mold you to start reachin' in the mornin'
In time

Well, well, there's a feelin', oh, so real in every human
On time
(About time)
There's a reelin' when you don't know what you're doing
In time
(About time)
Hey

Stay around and get a show
Hey, hey, hey, hey don't you know
(In time)
Two years too long to wait
Two words will get it straight
(In time)
You see an answer in time
(In time)
And that ain't nothin', I'm a dancer

Two years too long to wait
Oh, two words will get it straight
Two years too long to wait
Two words will get it straight
(Yeah sure, yeah sure, yeah)

Two years too long to wait
Two words will get it straight
(In time, in time)
Two years too long to wait
Two words will get it straight
