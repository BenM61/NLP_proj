Comin' out hard like '88, make a bitch levitate
Babyface savage, bitch, I don't play Patty Cake
Charms in the carrot cake, carats in the Patek face
Cop a new coupe, no top, that's the Cali' way
Drop a lil' check, everybody lit (lit)
Drop a lil' check, everybody rich (rich)
Drop a lil' check, everybody slide (slide)
Drop a lil' check, everybody die

Drop a lil' check, everybody die

Drop a little check, get active, action
Babyface savage, gon' pull up blastin'
Drop top comin' down Sunset, smashin'
Drop top comin' down Sunset, smashin'
Magic with the ratchet, make these bitches disappear
Itty bitty bitches in my mentions, listen here
Itty bitty bitch, I run the city like the mayor
The bitch with the red ponytail in her hair (in her hair)
Ridin' this beat like a motherfuckin' snare
Playin' with the bands like a bankroll (bankroll)
Pockets full of huncho, hundos (boom, boom)
Gotta keep the nine like Rondo
Cop a new condo, pronto
Rollin' Backwoods, no Fronto, f*ck no
Been had the juice, ten shots out the Bronco
Your bitch mad 'cause she ain't the one, though (the one though, bitch)

Get, get, get, get
Stones in the Cartier, hoes get naughtier
.44 leave a lil' hole in everybody here
Money, hoes, bitches, got more than everybody here
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
'Fore I get up out of here, we gon' let up out of here
Them broke hoes came to f*ck, gon' get a body here
Had a redhead with me, it ain't no Lil Yachty here
41 millimeter face, first 48
Bust down, water got it floodin' out the Rollie face
Money made, more to make, lot of hoes, more to take
New car, stolen plates, fast like Golden State
Nigga trippin', tell him he can get it by the shoulder blade
AK chopper, my bitch, we should go on dates
30 in the dirty on my hip, goin' both ways
I've been up four days, trappin' out the hallway
