Well, I never got my license to live
They won't give it up
So I stand at the world's edge

I'm trying to break in
Oh, I know it's not for me
And the sight of it all
Makes me sad and ill
That's when I want some weird sin

Things get too straight
I can't bear it
I feel stuck, stuck on a pin

I'm trying to break in
Oh, I know it's not for me
But the sight of it all
Makes me sad and ill
That's when I want
Some weird sin, that's when I want
Some weird sin, just to relax with

Yeah, some dumb, weird sin, for a while anyway
With my head on the ledge
That's what you get out on the edge
Some weird sin

Things get too straight
I can't bear it
I feel stuck, stuck on a pin

I'm trying to break in
Oh, I know it's not for me
But the sight of it all
Makes me sad and ill
That's when I want
Some weird sin, that's when I want
Some weird sin, just to relax with

Yes, some dumb weird sin, for a while anyway
With my head out on the ledge
That's what you get out on the edge
Some weird sin

Some weird sin
Some weird sin
