As the pages burn
Secrets can't be unlearned
Silence can't be unheard... Knowledge is burden
Power is onus as the pages burn

Rejecting cognition as the pages turn
Sinking in a pool of either
The past is washed clean

Rip apart the world
Word by word
Inch by inch

Sever your timeline
Silence your conscience

Sweet amnesia here to free you
As the pages burn (burn!)
All you trials solved bye fire
As the pages burn

As smoke fills the room soon to pass... heavy gloom
The wind will whisk away the past
A blank page stares at you
Nothing left
Where to start?

A second chance carries expectation!
The books you'd written no longer exist
The future is in your pen
Ink to paper now begin

Rip apart the world
Word by word
Inch by inch

Sever your timeline
Silence your conscience!

Sweet amnesia here to free you
As the pages burn (burn!)
All you trials solved bye fire
As the pages... burn!

Rewriting history
Starting now!
Erase the misery
Let the flames eat your doubts

Sweet amnesia here to free you
As the pages burn (burn!)
All you trials solved bye fire
As the pages burn!
