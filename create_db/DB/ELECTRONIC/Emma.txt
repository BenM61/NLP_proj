I put my hand into my pocket
I found the number for you
I don't know how I'm gonna stop it
We got so much to lose

I keep on asking lots questions
We've always heard they were read
It's like we're going 'round in circles
I found myself here again

And oh Emma, we keep ourselves to ourselves, yeah
Oh Emma, 'cause I know you're hurting
And don't leave your heart on the shelf
Don't wanna be of no one else

Yeah, I, I now remember every moment
That we spent alone
I stole kisses on the river
But now those days are gone

So tell me why there's always problems
So tell me why we always scream
Don't wanna mess with your emotions
I think its better I leave

Oh Emma, we keep ourselves to ourselves, yeah
Oh Emma, 'cause I know you're hurting
Don't leave your heart on the shelf
Your gonna be with someone else

And oh Emma, we keep ourselves to ourselves, yeah
Oh Emma, 'cause I know you're hurting
Don't leave your heart on the shelf
Your gonna be with someone else
