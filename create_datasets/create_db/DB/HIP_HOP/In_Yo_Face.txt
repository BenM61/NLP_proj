Ay, are we ready, we ready?

In yo face, ooh, look at 'em and get
In yo face, ooh, don't hate, I got it
In yo face, ooh, look at 'em and get
In yo face, ooh, I can't feel my face

Move, dog, I got this hill
He heard, I run this hill
Big ol' rappers cleaned up this shit
(Ah, looky here, looky here)

In yo face, I'm in the zone now
All of your things go home now
Bet you can't guess who owns now
Play with me now, I'm grown now
(In yo face)

DJ Unk No.1 in the game
How can my brother say these rented things?
Keeping it real, keeping it hood
And if someone falls, coming up to the game
(In yo face)

Never ever let 'em make him doubt you man
You don't want him to move without you man
You might be the best come up in the game
You're on your ground, shortstop man
(In yo face)

Under pressure, I does this
That's why the fans just love it
I give them hugs in public
(You over there, man)

Yes, I'm a winner, I'm a stay on top
Throw it up 'cause this side don't flop
Again 'n' again we won't stop
([Incomprehensible])

I'm starting you on the sideline
How does it feel to be around that pine?
DVS'S you know they shine
You can get there, just take your time

Can't stop this
(In yo face)
We poppin' bottles
(In yo face)
Got top model
(In yo face)
Man, I can't feel my face

According to now, there's part for one
I'll drop back and he gonna run
I think I'd see him roll out
Baby, bootleg
(Pop them hands out)

The side pass gunna blow him out
The whole arena just sold out
Touchdown without time to waste, I do my thang
(In yo face)

Can't get my size
Lose by ten, swallow up yo pride
We always win close games
Penetration ain't their side thang

Still I rise to butter your lane
Siren, she ain't got no game
Big ol' records, we ain't goin' to change
Where you from, what side you claim?
