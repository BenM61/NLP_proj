I'm coming down, I'm headed out
Chasing a cosmic constellation in the stars
That speed of sound can't catch me now
And by the time you see me I won't be around

Houston, we up, Earth ain't enough
You can call me rocket girl
Oh, Major Tom, you ain't so tough
Watch me fly across the universe
It's T minus one, ooh
You can call me rocket girl
It's T minus one, ooh
Watch me fly across the universe

I'm on a roll, I'm leaving home
He's throwin' down
Those neon lights, only the road
My speed of light, I'll blow your mind
I'll be the feeling you'll be dreaming of tonight

Houston, we up, Earth ain't enough
You can call me rocket girl
Oh, Major Tom, you ain't so tough
Watch me fly across the universe
It's T minus one, ooh
You can call me rocket girl
It's T minus one, ooh
Watch me fly across the universe

Uh uh uh 
Uh uh uh
Uh uh uh

It's T minus one, ooh
You can call me rocket girl
It's T minus one, ooh
Watch me fly across the universe
It's T minus one
It's T minus one
