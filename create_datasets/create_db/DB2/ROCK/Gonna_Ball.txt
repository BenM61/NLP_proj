Gonna ball, like I never did ball before, yeah
Gonna ball, like I never did ball before
I may never get a break like this in life no more

I got money in my pocket, I ain't begging for friends
Cadillac, El Dorado, and it's gone to my head
Short time to live, long time to stay dead
I ain't doin' no favors, I ain't asking for none
?Cause I got money, I can pay for my fun
That's the way I want it, that's the way it must be done

Gonna ball, like I never did ball before, yeah
Gonna ball, like I never did ball before
I may never get a break like this in life no more

I said little mama, we're gonna jump and shout
When that El Dorado holds up and I can walk it out
I wanna stay, pretty baby, you don't know what it's all about
I want no special woman, I want no special friend
I want a good time stay, yeah, tomorrow I may be down again
Don't dial my number, I'll tell you when

Gonna ball, like I never did ball before, yeah
Gonna ball, like I never did ball before
I may never get a break like this in life no more
What'd I tell ya

Gonna ball, like I never did ball before, yeah
Gonna ball, like I never did ball before
I may never get a break like this in life no more

I got money in my pocket, I ain't begging for friends
Cadillac, El Dorado, and it's gone to my head
Short time to live, long time to stay dead
I ain't doin' no favors, I ain't asking for none
?Cause I got money, I can pay for my fun
That's the way I want it, that's the way it must be done

Gonna ball, like I never did ball before, yeah
Gonna ball, like I never did ball before
I may never get a break like this in life no more
