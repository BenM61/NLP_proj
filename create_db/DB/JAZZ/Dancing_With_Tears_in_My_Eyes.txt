Those who dance and romance while they dance
They seem so happy and gay
Though they sing and they swing as they sway
Somehow I can't feel that way

For I'm dancing with tears in my eyes
'Cause the girl in my arms isn't you
Dancing with somebody new
When it's you that my heart's calling to

Trying to smile once in a while
But I find it so hard to do
For I'm dancing with tears in my eyes
'Cause the girl in my arms isn't you

While the throng's in the spell of a song
My thoughts keep drifting to you
While each pair seems to share their affair
They're making me blue

For I'm dancing with tears in my eyes
'Cause the girl in my arms isn't you
Dancing with somebody new
When it's you that my heart's calling to

Trying to smile once in a while
But I find it so hard to do
For I'm dancing with tears in my eyes
'Cause the girl in my arms isn't you
