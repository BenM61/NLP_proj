(Boy Backs)
You don't really want to mess with the blue face
Big cars and a grand in a suitcase
Haters want to hate cause they two-faced
Bankroll get cake dog too late
Little mama want to shake like a earthquake
Drop them drawers
Lock them jaws
Flip on my ass like Dominique Doll
Show them that you represent the RAM Squad raw WHOO
You don't really want daddy-blue bucks
Spinnin in a blue truck
Linen with the blue Chucks
You don't really want big daddy
Creepin with the girl next store like Shaggy
You don't really want to mess with Backs
You don't really want to test the gat
Test the mack
Test the all-time rap villain in black
Where the hoes and the dough be at the (row??) be at

(Tommy Hil)
Yo y'all cats don't want it with the T Hill

Bankroll hit the club like gimme some mo' (gimme some mo')
Meet me at the back do' (back do')
So we can slide in
All my niggas ridin
y'all niggas want to ride with me
y'all niggas want to smoke and get high with me
Bitch trippin like I'm Jodeci

In the club hoes next to me

While I beat her with a pis-tal

You could drive the truck but you can't Dodge Ram it
