Who can be the boss? 
Look up to the cross 
Stranded in the land of the lost 
Standin up, I'm sideways 
I'm blazin' up the path 
Runnin on the highways of rap 
Choked up by the smoke and the charcoal 
Lava stamps and brands me like a barcode 
I'm Dashin all the meteor strikes 
Keep the media dykes 
As re-enforcements for the fight 
And that alone with keep John Ghotti on the phone 
Tangled in his own I got the bees on the track 
Where the f*ck you at? 
Tical
Let me hear you pigeons run your mouth now 
Shut the f*ck up!
I'm pluggin in them social skills 
That keep my total bills over a million 
The last time I checked it 
Thank God I'm blessed with the mind that I wreck it 
Wait until the second round, I'll knock him out 

They call me big John stud 
My middle name mud 
Dirty water flow 
Too much for you thugs 
That can't stand the flood 
What up doc? 
Hold big gun like Elmer Fudd 
The sure shot 
Mr. Meth I'm unplugged 
Learn 
Temperature's too hot for sunblock 
Burn 
Playin with minds can get you state time 
Lock behind twelve bars from a great mind 
Killa bees in the club when there's ladybug 
Brought a sword to tha dance floor to cut a rug 
Love is love all day 'til they both slug 
And take another life in cold blood 
Can't feel me? 
Cause it's your blood 
Murder is tremendous 
Crime is endless 
Same shit different day 
Father forgive us 
They know not what they do 
Our praises do 
I'm big like easy, ya bigbamboo 

What's that, I didn't hear you? 
Shut the f*ck up! 
Come on a little louder 
Shut the f*ck up! 
Everybody N 2 Gether now 
Shut the f*ck up! 
What? What? 

Headstrong, deadcon, dead by dawn 
Deadweight they dead wrong 
Let's get it on 
Twelve rounds of throwdown 
Who hold crown? 
Protect land with both pound 
Limp Bizkit 
Get around like merry-go 
What's the scenario? 
Comin' through your stereo 
Why risk it 
Lifestyles of the prolific and gifted 
Eight essential vitamins and minerals 
Delicious 
Word on the street is 
They bit my thesis 
Knocked out their front teethes 
Tryin to taste mine 
Actin like they heard through the grapevine 
Dope fiendin for the baseline 
To provide rhyme 
Pharmaceuticals 
Hard as nails to the cubicle 
Where you find that monster 
She beautiful 
Wu-Tang and Limp Bizkit 
Roll on the check 
Kick a hole in the speaker 
Pull the plug and inject 

Mic check 
So what's it all about? 
Where we gonna run? 
Maybe we can meet up on the sun 
Discretion is advised 
For the blood of virgin eyes 
Limpin on the track with Method 
So get the sunblock 
You get your one shot 
Until you dissolve 
I revolve around everything you got 
From outta nowhere prepare 
You'll be blinded by the glare 
I told you not to stare 
Now you're turned into stone 
Without a microphone 
But don't you forget you're in the zone 
So shut the f*ck up!
And take that shit back 
Cause all your shit's whack 
Doodoo is doodoo
When it's way down like that 
Burnin up your brain like a piston 
So all those who didn't listen 
Never even knew what they were missin 
And never even knew that the sky was fallin down 
Wu-Tang Clan for the crown 

What's that, I didn't hear you? 
Shut the f*ck up! 
Come on a little louder 
Shut the f*ck up! 
Everybody N2 Gether now 
Shut the f*ck up! 
What? What? 

It was over your head all day every day 
S-I-N-Y 
1-0-3-0-4 
Wu-Tang, Killa Bees, and the Limp 
B-I-Z-K-I-T 
Gotta know the time 
Gotta know to rhyme 
It ain't easy bein greezy 
In a world of cleanliness and you know all that other madness 
We gone 
Peace 

Limp Bizkit, Method Man, rock the house y'all, bring it on 

Hey wait up, where you guys going? You're not recording are you? I'm all alone 
I can't do this 
Feel it 
You guys feel it out there? 
Check your head if you feel it 
Hey, hey, hey 
Every day is brigther than the next day, at least that's what you think
