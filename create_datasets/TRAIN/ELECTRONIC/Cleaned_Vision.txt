Wires
Wires

Everyone wires run
With human figures
Wires like graphs
Nerves
Wind up in this area
Transmit and receive

Aerials three dimensional
Wonderful sensetive complexity
Faint glimmer a matrix of flesh and bloods
Hideously human

Suspending in dark radiation
The appearance of a divine ignition
Binary conversation
Dying in radiate darkness

Wires provide energy
Reversed polarities
Magnetic pins
Dancing plasmic streets
Leading to power and circuitry
