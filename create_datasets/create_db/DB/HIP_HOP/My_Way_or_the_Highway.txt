-P. Barrett-

Mi tired fi every evening me go home
Me girl a tell me the same thing over and over again
Bwoy, she just keep repeating every time
The girl always a say. Hear weh she say

I am saying,
It's my way or the highway
You should be going
You made your choice and now you know what's coming
Pack your things and don't come back no more no more
Don't come back
Me can't believe a you say so
Nothing couldn't go so
Me no do you nothing
How you want me leggo
(repeat)

I am appointed by Jah
To go everywhere and preach
People of this world
Request that I speak
I am present in the studio
Seven nights of the week
And working hard to make two ends meet
So erase all the negative thoughts from your mind
Don't judge me by the past 'cause I am right this time
'Cause although for a week I am not in your sight
You should not be saying awful things like
Oh stop delaying
It's my way or the highway
You should be going
You made your choice and now you know what's coming
Pack your things and don't come back no more no more
Don't come back

Me can't believe a you say so
Nothing couldn't go so
Me no do you nothing
How you want me leggo
(repeat)

I have not lied
God knows I have tried
To reach your heart but that has been denied
So I am asking you to observe each side
And please let your conscience be your guide
I know that maybe you are not in one of the best mood
But that should not dictate your attitude
The wrong decision could be devastating
'Cause in the long run you will be sorry that you sing

I am not playing
It's my way or the highway
You should be going
You made your choice and now you know what's coming
Pack your things and don't come back no more no more
Don't come back

Me can't believe a you say so
Nothing couldn't go so
Me no do you nothing
How you want me leggo
(repeat)

I know what I must do for the people of this world
Every woman every man and every boy and girl
You should be giving me strength so that I go along
Instead of making this false accusation
It's kind of shocking but I am still watching
If you will be changing that old saying
You know what I am thinking is that you are not willing
To do some listening you keep repeating

I am not playing
It's my way or the highway
You should be going
You made your choice and now you know what's coming
Pack your things and don't come back no more no more
Don't come back

Me no do you nothing
How you want me leggo
(repeat)

I always believe that you could understand
'Cause we had some much of these conversations
If I went out with another woman
That would be giving justification
You speech is causing embarrassment
And I am sure this time that I am innocent
Since you insist you get your heart content
But make sure you can stand the consequence

I am still saying
It's my way or the highway
You should be going
You made your choice and now you know what's coming
Pack your things and don't come back no more no more
Don't come back
