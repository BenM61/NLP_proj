Holding you
Couldn't be alone
Loving you
Couldn't be alone
Kissing you

Holding you
Couldn't be alone
Loving you
Couldn't be alone
Kissing you
Tell me how can you, tell me I belong, tell me I belong

Its not why I trust you, not why I trust you, not why I trust you
Not why I trust you
It's not why I trust you, not why I trust you, not why I trust you
Not why I trust you

Tell me, how can you
Holding you
Couldn't be alone
Loving you
Couldn't be alone
Kissing you
Tell me how can you, tell me I belong, tell me I belong
