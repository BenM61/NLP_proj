When it's time to party we will party hard

You,
You work all night (all night)
And when you work you don't feel all right
And we,
We can't stop feeling all right (all right)
And everything is all right

'Cause we will never listen to your rules (no)
We will never do what others do
(No)
Do what we want and we get it from you
Do what we like and we like what we do

So let's get a party going (let's get a party going)
Now it's time to party and we'll party hard (party hard)
Let's get a party going (let's get a party going)
When it's time to party we will always party hard
Party hard (party hard, party hard, party hard party hard, party har

All right
You,
You break the thing
And when you play you feel all right
But we,
We can't stop feeling all right (all right)
And everything is all right

'Cause we will never listen to your rules (no)
We will never do what others do

We do what we like and we like what we do
