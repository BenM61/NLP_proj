Though, it took me by surprise
One by one, I realized
There was somethin', I could do

I lost my way, that's what she said
Back to the 101
If we don't know, somewhere to go
Back to the 101

I never said, to feel relaxed
I never said, to love me back
What was I next to you?

And in my mind, it all goes black
Lost control of what I had
All my thoughts, left one by one

I lost my way, that's what she said
Back to the 101
Back to the one, another one
Back to the 101

I count the one
I count the one
I count the 101

I count the one
I count the one
I count the 101

I know
(I count the one)
I lost
(I count the one)
My way
(I count the 101)

This time
(I count the one)
We?ll find
(I count the one)
A place
(I count the 101)

I know
(I count the one)
I lost
(I count the one)
My way
(I count the 101)

This time
(I count the one)
We?ll find
(I count the one)
A place
(I count the 101)
