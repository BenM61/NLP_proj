A lover spurned, a lesson learned
On love you've got your fingers burnt
Shed bitter tears, now love has turned
The sweet revenge of a lover spurned

A passing phase, a week of love
But all at once you had enough
It pales so soon, waned with the moon
No deep concern for a lover spurned

She'll destroy you with her little games
See you swallow all the blame
Make you pay in many ways
For the pleasure of watching you squirm

She'll tell her friends to treat you rough
That you just weren't good enough
Make the going really tough
For the pleasure of watching you burn in hell

And every day, more guilt to pay
A lesson learned from a lover spurned

It was all so cozy for you
You had a wife, two children
And a beautiful house
And me, well you wanted me

When it suited your needs
And now, now I have nothing
Just a handful of faded photographs
Nothing but a cold empty heart

But I'm not easily forgotten
I'll appear when you least expect
To make you pay
You asked for it that way

She'll come to get you with a knife
Write poison letters to your wife
Totally destroy your life
For the pleasure of watching you squirm

She'll make a fool of you at work
Drag your name through the dirt
Make sure that it really hurts
For the pleasure of watching you burn in hell

A lover spurned, a lesson learned
On love you've got your fingers burnt
Shed bitter tears, now love has turned
The sweet revenge of a lover spurned
