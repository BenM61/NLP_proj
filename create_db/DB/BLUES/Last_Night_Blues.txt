You know I went home last night
Sat down on my bed and cried
I went home, I went home last night, Sonny
Sat down on my bed and cried
Yeah, you know I was thinkin' about my little woman
And at the time poor lightnin' couldn't be satisfied
Lord, have mercy

You know the nightmares got on me
Whoa, they rode me all night long
You know the nightmares jumped on poor lightnin'
Ooh Lord, it rode me all night long
And I woke up not findin' nothin' but a dream
That's why I'm singin' this lonesome song

I don't care when you go little woman
I don't care how long you stay
I don't care when you go little woman
I don't care how long you stay
Yeah, you know them old good kind treatments
They bring a woman back home one day
Don't worry about it, just call her one time

Katie Mae, whoa, Katie Mae
Katie Mae, whoa, Katie Mae
Katie Mae, whoa, Katie Mae, now, don't you
I know you hear me even if you don't answer
I'm just prayin' to me good Lord up in Heaven
Katie Mae will come back home to me someday

Play it a while, ooh Lord
