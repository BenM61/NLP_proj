Get down
I'll sleep it off
You don't have to believe no more
Only got four hours
To learn your manners
Never felt so close to you before

Don't you
Don't get it wrong
I'll have someone to get it done
Only got four hours
To learn your manners
Never felt so close to you before

Long shot
In the name of God
Need a McCartney song
All I want you to know
Is that I won't be here for long
And my heart
Oh! my heart is getting sore
