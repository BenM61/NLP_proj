Listen to me baby, you've got to understand
You're old enough to learn the makings of a man
Listen to me baby, it's time to settle down
Am I asking too much for you stick around?

Every boy wants a girl he can trust to the very end
Baby that's you, won't you stay? But 'till then,
When I see lips begging to be kissed, I can't stop (stop) I can't stop myself

Lightning striking again (and again, and again, and again, and a-)
Lightning striking again (and again, and again, and again, and a-)

Nature's taken over my one-track mind
Believe it or not, you're in my heart all the time
All the girls are saying that you'll end up a fool
For the time being, baby, live by my rules

When I settle down, I want one baby on my mind
Forgive and forget, and I'll make up for all lost time
If she's got to get out fine, then she's on my mind
I can't stop (stop) I can't stop myself

Lightning striking again (and again, and again, and again, and a-)
Lightning striking again (and again, and again, and again, and a-)

There's a chapel in the pines waiting for us, around the bend
Picture in your mind love forever. But 'till then,
When I see lips begging to be kissed, I can't stop (stop) I can't stop myself

Lightning striking again (and again, and again, and again, and a-)
Lightning striking again (and again, and again, and again, and a-)
Lightning striking again (and again, and again, and again, and a-)
Lightning striking again (and again, and again, and again, and a-)
Lightning striking again (and again, and again, and again, and a-)
Lightning striking again (and again, and again, and again, and a-)
Lightning striking again (and again, and again, and again, and a-)
