Though you say we're through, I'll always love you
And you can depend on me
Though someone you've met has made you forget
You know, you can count on me

I wish you success, loads of happiness
But I must confess, I'll be lonely
If you need a friend, I'm yours till the end
And you can depend on me

You know, you can depend on me
And you can depend on me

I wish you success, loads of happiness
But I must confess, I'm gonna be lonely
If you need a friend, I'm yours till the end
And you can depend on me

You know you can count on me
