I never felt 
So lonesome before; 
My friend has quit me; 

He's gone for sure; 
He broke my heart, 
For I loved him true; 
So now I'm worried, 

Lonesome and blue. 
I've got the blues on my mind, 
And I just feel like crying all the time. 
Woke up this morning, the day was dawning, 

And I was feeling all sad and blue, 
I had nobody to tell my troubles to; 
I felt so worried, 
I didn't know what to do. 

But there's no use in grievin', because I'm leavin', 
I'm broken-hearted and Dixie-bound; 
I been mistreated, ain't got no time to lose. 
My train is leaving, 

And I got the down-home blues. 
Woke up this morning, the day was dawning, 
And I was feeling all sad and blue, 
Lord, I had nobody to tell my troubles to; 

I felt so worried, 
I didn't know what to do. 
But there's no use in grievin', because I'm leavin', 
I'm broken-hearted and Dixie-bound; 

Lord, I been mistreated, ain't got no time to lose. 
My train is leaving, 
And I got the down-home blues.
