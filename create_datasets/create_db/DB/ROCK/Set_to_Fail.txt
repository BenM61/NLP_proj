You want to hate me for the way you hate yourself
You think you can find who you are in someone else
Criticize who already found their positioning
You've got a long way to go

So go and weave your tale of woe
Convincing yourself it's so
You're so set to fail
Somewhere you finally lost your way
Only yourself left to betray

A needless ir-repair repairing your despair
You take great measure to appear like you don't care
The decision and persuasion must deceive thee properly
You lost it before you began

So go and weave your tale of woe
Convincing yourself it's so
You're so set to fail
Somewhere you finally lost your way
Only yourself left to betray

Only yourself left to betray

So go and weave your tale of woe
Convincing yourself it's so
You're so set to fail
Somewhere you finally lost your way
Only yourself left to betray

Somewhere you finally lost your way
Only yourself left to betray
