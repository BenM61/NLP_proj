Drummer boy
Heavens deaf, drummer boy
Heavy metal band sing with me
Deep sleep, we can march to the beat
Heavy metal band deal with me
Drummer boy
Put the move on the beat
Let the other ones stick with me
Deep sleep
Put the heat on the street
Let the enemy sing with me
Oh

Bomb heaven
Can they bomb heaven in

Heavy metal band fall with me
Bomb heaven
They can bomb heaven in
Heavy metal band deal with me
Drummer boy
Heavens deaf, drummer boy
Heavy metal band stick with me
Deep sleep
Put the heat on the street
Let the enemy sing with me

Oh
