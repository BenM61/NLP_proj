Guards have been waiting too long
Their eyes are getting heavy now I think they've finally fallen asleep
Is that someone I hear outside my gate

You know the walls are falling in my head 
Tonight girl
You know the walls are falling in my head
Tonight girl

I'm a headstone waiting for words so just carve my epitaph for me
I can't ignore the songs of the past and wake up screaming from
A borrowed dream
Listening to your eyes speak as the words are falling from my mouth
It's a sordid state of belief when your last defense has sold you
Out for good

You know the walls are falling in my head
Tonight girl
You know the walls are falling in my head
Tonight girl
You know the walls are falling in my head
Tonight girl
You know the walls are falling in my head 
Tonight tonight tonight tonight
