Tell me about your planet's air
Can I breathe in, or should I dare?
Way down beneath your clouds
Will it be dry or will I drown?

I'm gonna slingshot around your star
You'll stretch my gravity too far
You're gonna spin me off my mark
You'll bend my molecules too far

What is it like walking on your ground?
Will I feel light or a thousand pounds?
Way down beneath your sea
Will it be clear or nowhere to see?

I'm gonna slingshot around your star
You'll stretch my gravity too far
You're gonna spin me off my mark
You'll bend my molecules too far
