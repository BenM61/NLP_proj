Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa 
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa 
Wait a minute let me understand
 
While I'm a-sittin' here holdin' your hand 
 
Your tellin' me about the boy next door
Tellin' me that he can offer you more
What a nerve! 
What a case! 
 
Wait just a minute 
You know that won't get it
Wock-a-doo wock-a-doo 
If that's the way your love will be, 
You might as well forget it
Wock-a-doo, wock-a-doo, wha 

Am I correct in hearin' what you say, 
That you would rather be with him instead 
You said that you could travel with him far 
You say he's got a brand new cadillac car 
Well, what you mean?
Is that so!?!
Better let that woman go! 

Wait just a minute 
You know that won't get it
Wock-a-doo wock-a-doo 
If that's the way your love will be, 
You might as well forget it
Wock-a-doo, wock-a-doo, wha 

I don't go for all the crazy noise 
About you datin' all those other boys 
If I'm gonna be your only one 
I'm not waitin' till your honey's done. 
You're a riot! 
And you're tough! 
Honey, cut out all that stuff

Wait just a minute 
You know that won't get it
Wock-a-doo wock-a-doo 
If that's the way your love will be, 
You might as well forget it
Wock-a-doo, wock-a-doo, wha 

I'm gonna tell you for the very last time, 
If I'm yours, you better be mine. 
When I come home about a quarter to four 
Don't want to hear the slammin' of the back door 
You're bad! 
And so wild! 
Stop a-messin with me, child! 

You might as well forget it
 
Why, you can just forget about 
The whole cotton-pickin' affair!
I get so tired of you finaglin' around
