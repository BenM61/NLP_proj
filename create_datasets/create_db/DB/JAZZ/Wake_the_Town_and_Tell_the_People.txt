Wake the town and tell the people
Sing it to the moon above
Wake the town and tell the people
Tell them that we're so in love (tell them that we're so in love)

Let's begin the celebration
Let's declare a holiday
Send the wedding invitation
To the neighbors right away

When you are close to me
And my heart is dancing with delight
I want the world to see
Heaven in my arms tonight

Shout it from the highest steeple
Ring the bells the whole night through
Wake the town and tell the people
Tell them I'm in love with you

I want the world to see
Heaven in my arms tonight

Shout it from the highest steeple
Ring the bells the whole night through
Wake the town and tell the people
Tell them I'm in love with you

I want the world to see
Heaven in my arms tonight

Shout it from the highest steeple
Ring the bells the whole night through
Wake the town and tell the people
Tell them I'm in love with you

(Wake the town and tell the people)
