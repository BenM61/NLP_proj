You've been living in a rot
And you can say you're not
But in case you forgot
You gotta give it your best shot

You've been bowin' on spots like metronome
Pack rat packs 'The Papers' like super gnome
Punch the clock in situations no win
Catch the weekdays past and next begins

Ambitions overrated, gets equated
With the freedom you'll be cravin', motivated than sedated
Feel like crackle doin' battle with the working cattle
The same shackle tackles the fellows, the pains, the marrow

Communities used once then destroyed
To many pawns, just to fill the void
Now you hit reflex real stallion
Blow steam like shining gold medallion

Scandalous, vandalous
Morals vanishing, chemicals refills
Sex kill, panting weekday
One wrecks the promise of 2001 violent

Saturday teenage kick, kicks in
Saturday teenage kick, kicks in
Saturday teenage kick, kicks in
Hey, get the chicks in

Saturday teenage kick, kicks in
Saturday teenage kick, kicks in
Saturday teenage kick, kicks in
Hey, get the chicks in

You've been rocking those spots
And you can say you're not
But in case you forgot
You gotta give it your best shot

Saturday teenage kick, kicks in
Saturday teenage kick, kicks in
Saturday teenage kick, kicks in
Hey, get the chicks in

Saturday teenage kick, kicks in
Saturday teenage kick, kicks in
Saturday teenage kick, kicks in
Hey, get the chicks in

You've been rocking those spots
And you can say you're not
But in case you forgot
You gotta give it your best shot

Saturday teenage kick, kicks in
Saturday teenage kick, kicks in
Saturday teenage kick, kicks in
Hey, get the chicks in

Enough said
