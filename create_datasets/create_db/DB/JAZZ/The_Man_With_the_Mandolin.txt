Here comes the man with the mandolin 
He'll cheer you up till your ship comes in 
Loveable old fellow playing an old tune 
He comes round every afternoon 

Raggedy old minstrel wearing a big grin 
You'll love the man with the mandolin 
All the kids follow, all the kids holler 
To the windows above, 

"Mama, throw a nickle, and the man will 
Pick a little tune we love..." 
Open your heart, let the music in, 
There goes the man with the mandolin!
