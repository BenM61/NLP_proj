Call me old fashioned 
But I'm a little nervous about the future
I've got no enthusiasm 
For burgers or computers

Televisions bores me now
In a hundred different ways
And the police are getting younger
Getting younger every day 

All I wanted was some tender loving care
Before it gets sponsored with the water and the air
You want it 
You've got it

You took it all from me
My cheque book, my wallet
My pride and dignity
And I can't even get a taxi 

To the safety of my house
The driver gets a nosebleed
If he travels that far south
All I wanted was some tender loving care

Before it gets sponsored with the water and the air
Dear Claire
Sincerely
Bored of London

By the way
The police are getting younger every day
I want to see the sights I want to hear the songs
About human right and about human wrongs

I'm as lovesick and as stupid as all the rubbish that I heard
The public gets the music that no public could deserve
They put me in the spot light tied me to the stage
The only thing I got right wa to lie about my age

I've been fitted up for size for Top Of The Pops
In a uniform supplied by the gkam rock cops
All I ever wanted was some tender loving care
Before it gets sponsored with the water and the air

Dear Claire
Sincerely
Bored of London
By the way
