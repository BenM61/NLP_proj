I can't believe the tales you tell me,
I ain't buying the stuff you sell me,
Hey baby, I'm telling you what,
You think I'm sold but maybe I'm not,
You tell me, tales of glory,
But I know, whoa babe it's the same old story,

You think I'm gonna fall for you,
You reckon that I'm going right through,
But I ain't no adolescent,
I'm just gonna keep you guessing,
You ain't gonna stitch me up,
You'll find that I'm real bad luck,
I'm gonna leave you babe,
But think of the money you'll save,
You tell me, tales of glory,
But I know whoa babe it's the same old story

Leave me out, leave me out,
Sick and tired without a doubt,
Get me out, get me out,
Get me out of here,
Endlessly, endlessly,
Your mouth won't set me free,
Endlessly, endlessly,
Rabbit in my ear
