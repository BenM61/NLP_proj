Listening, I hear your voice
Together you and I have nothing left to carry on
And I'm seeing you slip away
Cause you never cared
You never even realised

Now the thrill has gone
Cause I can see it in your eyes
Now the thrill has gone
And it was you who threw it all away
Now the thrill has gone

Wondering as I look outside
Changes all around
There's nothing left here to hide
And I'm asking you have you lost your soul
Cause you never cared
You never even realised that I wasn't there

Now the thrill has gone
Cause I can see it in your eyes
Now the thrill has gone
And it was you who threw it all away
Now the thrill has gone

Say to me what I want to hear
Say to me what I want to hear
Say to me what I want to hear
Cause you never cared
You never even realised that I wasn't there

Now the thrill has gone
Cause I can see it in your eyes
Now the thrill has gone
And it was you who threw it all away
Now the thrill has gone

Now the thrill has gone
Now the thrill has gone
Now the thrill has gone
