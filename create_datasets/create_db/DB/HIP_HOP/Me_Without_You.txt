Raindrops rolling off my brim
Street lights got the pavement glistenin'
Touchdown, I've fallen to Your arms, right where I belong
Your everlasting arms

And where would I be without You
I'd be packing my bags when I need to stay
I'd be chasing every breeze that blows my way
I'd be building my kingdom just to watch it fade away
Its true
That's me without you
That's me without you
That's me without you
Don't know where I'd be without you

(Whoa...Without you)

Flashback
Stepping through the scene
There's You and there's a very different me.
Touchdown, You had me at believe, You had me at believe, You did

And where would I be without You, without You
I'd be packing my bags when I need to stay
I'd be chasing every breeze that blows my way
I'd be building my kingdom just to watch it fade away
Its true
That's me without you
That's me without you
That's me without you
Don't know where I'd be without you

(Where would I be...)

You rescued me
You are mine, I am Yours
You rescued me
And I am Yours forever
You saved me, remade me,
Where would I be

I'd be packing my bags when I need to stay
I'd be chasing every breeze that blows my way
I'd be building my kingdom just to watch it fade away
It's true

I'd be packing my bags when I need to stay
I'd be chasing every breeze that blows my way
I'd be building my kingdom just to watch it fade away
It's true

That's me without you
That's me without you
That's me without you
Don't know where I'd be without you
(That's me without you)
Don't know where I'd be without you
