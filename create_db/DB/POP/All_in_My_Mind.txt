I think that you don´t care, 
And it´s more than I can bear, 
I don´t know baby, 
Maybe it´s all in my mind, all in my mind.

I know that I´ve been true, 
But honey sweetie baby what about you? 
I don´t know baby, 
Maybe it´s all in my mind.

We´ve been going steady so long, 
I´d never dream you would ever do me wrong, 
I knew I was yours and I thought you were mine, 
And that every little thing was so fine.

Whoa darling, I´d hate to see, 
Someone else with you other than me, 
I don´t know baby, 
Maybe it´s all in my mind, all in my mind
Oh yes, it´s all in my mind.
