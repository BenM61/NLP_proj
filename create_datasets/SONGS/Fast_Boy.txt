I'm a fast boy
I've got worry
I've got engagements
I'm in a hurry
So come on

Don't use telephones
I won't hear ya
Beneath the radar
So inferior
So come on

Who's the man every weekend
Who's the fast boy, who's your best friend
First you twist my arm, then you grease my palm
Keeping cool and calm, not doing any harm.

I'm a fast boy
I'm on the guest list
I've got a gram of joy
Wrapped in a clenched fist
So come on

Who's the man every weekend
Who's the fast boy, who's your best friend
First you twist my arm, then you grease my palm
Keeping cool and calm, not doing any harm.

Please not a word to the mother
Please not a word to the mother
Please not a word to the mother
So come on
