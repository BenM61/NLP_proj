You took my heart, misery
You taught me blues
Well I got a lot of patience baby
That's a lot of patience to lose
I'm crying, I'm mad at my country
Now I've been treated bad
When I was a freeport and you were the main drag.

Broken blues, I just don't know
Little bird, flying by my window
Take me where you go
I'm crying - I'm looking at these times
And It's bound to drive me mad
When I was a freeport and you were the main drag.

What did I do?
Everybody's putting me down
I keep running
But the law kept coming around.

So fare thee well, happiness
Cause I got blues
And I got a lot of patience baby
That's a lot of patience to lose
I'm a woman
Waiting for due time
Now I've been treated bad
When I was a freeport and you were the main drag
