This lifestyles got me on my toes, but I'ma let it go
I'll lick pretend you were clinching my face, how does this exist?
Relieve some tension

We used to climb inside his cheese, girls and un-scrapped knee's
And we chase down, the sound of girls who couldn't place, it finally caught ya, it ain't like I want ya

Time, time, time, time to do what I want, forget all them other fools, its us to choose
Do what you got to do

Time, time, time, time to do what I want, forget all them other fools, its us to choose
Do what you got to do

Do the best to jump over our fans
Who guzzle under the influence influence
We've got to be stronger than that, we'll bore in missin' lands

So we shout out "Our we the resistance?" and we ride, a wiza' can be
'Cause it doesn't make a difference, never makes a difference

And we chase down, the sound of girls who couldn't place, it finally caught ya, it ain't like I want ya

Time, time, time, time to do what I want, forget all them other fools, its us to choose
Do what you got to do

Time, time, time, time to do what I want, forget all them other fools, its us to choose
Do what you got to do
