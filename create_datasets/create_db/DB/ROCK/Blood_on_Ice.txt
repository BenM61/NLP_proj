The old Crow's cry the first warning
The rumbling frozen ground the last.
Hooves thundering on the three feet snow,
The icy dawn yet to begin.

Bursting through the icy morning four times five black shadows a horse.
Steel glimmering in the awakening sun's light,
And blood colors the white snow red.
Cries echo through the dark deep woods.
Open wounds steam in the cold morning air,
And the new day was greeted with a burden
both raped and dead.

Long scalps hung by the old twin headed Beast's standard black.
Women and children brought far north into the land of no turning back
The burning village spread by the wind across the tundra

Cry old Crow cry.

Long tall beautiful people fallen lifeless to the ground
Headless scattered still graceful bodies.
Blood colored the white snow all around.
Through the dark deep woods to the mountains towering to the sky
The wind carries the quest for revenge and the tale of Blood on Ice.

The eternal deep dark woods
Late daytime
