You'll never see a dark cloud
Hanging 'round me
Now there is only blue sky
To surround me
There's never been a grey day
Since you found me
Everything I touch
Is turning to gold 

So you can colour my world
With sunshine yellow each day
Oh you can colour my world
With happiness all the way
Just take the green from the grass
And the blue from the sky up above
And if you colour my world
Just paint it with your love
Just colour my world, mmh

Just as long as I know
You're thinking of me
There'll be a rainbow
Always up above me
Since I found the one
Who really loves me
Everything I touch
Is turning to gold

So you can colour my world
With sunshine yellow each day
Oh you can colour my world
With happiness all the way
Just take the green from the grass
And the blue from the sky up above
And if you colour my world
Just paint it with your love
Just colour my world, mmh

Sunshine yellow, orange blossom
Laughing faces everywhere, yeah 

So you can colour my world
With sunshine yellow each day
Oh you can colour my world
With happiness all the way
Just take the green from the grass
And the blue from the sky up above
And if you colour my world
Just paint it with your love
Just colour my world, mmh

Colour my world
Oh colour my world
