You seem to like it, when I'm down
Kinda makes you feel tall
Step right up, stand on me
I'll learn how to crawl

You treat me so unkind
This may seem way outta line

I'll get down on my hands and knees
If you want me to
Oh, I'm crawling on my hands and knees
Crawling back to you, oh, that's all I want to do

Can't understand, what keeps me hooked
It's like I'm chained and tied
A slave to love, she's gotta whip across my back
I've had to swallow my pride

'Cause when she turns away
I've got to have a shot every day

I'll get down on my hands and knees
If you want me to
Yeah, I'm crawling on my hands and knees
Tryin' to get to you, that's all I want to do

Yeah, you treat me so unkind
This may seem way outta line

But I'll get down on my hands and knees
Crawling back to you
Yeah, I'll get down on my hands and knees
If you want me to

I'm crawling on my hands and knees
I'm tryin' to get to you
