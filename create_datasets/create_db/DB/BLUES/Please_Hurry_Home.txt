Well, I'm feeling alright
Everything's okay
Well, I'm feeling alright
And everything's okay
Well, I got a letter from my baby
She's coming home today

Oh, won't you come on, baby?
Baby, please hurry home
Oh, won't you come on, baby?
Baby, please hurry home
Yes, I'm tired of sleeping by myself
And I'm tired of being alone

Well, I'm looking for you, baby
And everything's alright
Well, I'm looking for you, baby
Everything's alright
Yeah, but if you don't get here in the morning
Please be here by tonight

Oh, hurry, baby
Please catch the first train
Oh, hurry, baby
Please catch the first train
Well, if you don't hurry home, baby
Old be's gonna go insane
