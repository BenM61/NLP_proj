Rolled over from last night's dreams
Happiness isn't from a...
Drink me up in your thoughts
Just like I do with you
Are you that thirsty too?

Whoa, I am erratic
Can't break the habit
My current status 
To you I'm insomniatic

My train is off the track
It seems delirious from my loss of sleep
Deprived, I grieve the day
Won't be easy to do
Are you this restless, too?

Whoa, I am erratic
Can't break the habit
My current status
To you I'm insomniatic

One by one, the days grow longer and longer
And I in my own sweet pain grow stronger
I must admit, I must admit, I must admit it's a good insane
I must admit, I must admit, help me admit

Whoa, I am erratic
Can't break the habit
My current status
To you I'm insomniatic
