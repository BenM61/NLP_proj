By the way
The only question didn't get an answer
Where we're coming from and where we're going to
On this dawn, leading us from somewhere?

Out of darkness we came, and land on mark these days
But to us
Guideless we let and fall just these ways
By these ways

For me, religion isn't just a tale
Telling from past times
It tells about a meeting
Between us and astronauts from distant stars
You have to read between the lines! 

Thousands of girls before loved angels
And want rescue ends
For if I look around, now all aware
Drop very same wond'ring face
By, by, Oh! 

Now all alone, it will take me along from here
Before you see offset

One day, when we fly at the speed of light
We'll find a star and not the human race

You try to unblock the understanding
And keep slowly blight and may be even bright
In time, too long era to last
Will I want go to the sun?

Gather, became a house of fools
With flaming roof and based on sand below
Heaven, got sagged and saled on mourning
But prepared by the inner soul
But break down, but break soon brings good

By, by, by the way
We really could find the answer
Where we're coming from and where we're going to
On this good dawn, leading us from somewhere

Out of darkness we came, and land on mark these days
But to us
Guideless we let and fall just these ways
By these ways
