Born from the sky,
We are born to this land.
From a dream, so far away,
I was sent to your heart.
With the stars shining,
We are asked to live as one love.
Never forget, this is.

Trust me to be singlet,
We will sing on the days.
When each voice will be a witness,
Each will sing every way.
There'll be no more empty promises.
We are turning a special page of life.
I will be the one to hold you
In this everlasting dance of love. 	

Hold me, now forever.
I can remember when
You and I came through the winter.
Now it's summer again.
Be mine, be my love, be my guide, together
We'll be as one, you can count on my life.

Born from the sky.

ahhhhhh...

Words of discouragement disappear
In your clear eyes.
Never change, never doubt
What you mean to my life.
