You can hide your eyes you can dim the lights but they are watching!
This is a new time with a different kind they are the future
The only one!
 
This is the final call for the setting sun when they get closer.
And with a fall from grace thy will be done the show is over.
It's a new dawn!
 
Just leave this place behind
I'll clear your bloodshot mind.
They only wanted your love on demand.
This is a better way!
 
We are standing by no time to hide no meeting half way.
You were sucking life through the needles eye this is a new day.
They have won!
 
We will surrender now or be outdone left in the open.
It's the cooling of horizon they are the future.
The future!
 
When all your fears combined the manifest was refined
And I know you really tried to understand.
This is a new way!
