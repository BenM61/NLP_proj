Ooh love, you got me so mad
I give you all of my lovin'
Best that you've ever had
Ooh love
Ooh love

I wanna settle down, stop lookin'
Spend all my time not worryin'
I wanna find the one to spend all of my days
I want it to be you, I'm crazy for you, babe

Ooh love, you got me so mad
I give you all of my lovin'
Best that you've ever had
Ooh love, you're not treating me right
I got my shoes on now
I might be leaving tonight
You're gonna miss me in the morning
You're gonna miss me in the morning

It's been so nice to spend the time
Searching for clues to ease my mind
But I can't relax and I can't move on
Are you that someone?
Are you that someone?

Ooh love, you got me so mad
I give you all of my lovin'
Best that you've ever had
Ooh love, you're not treating me right
I got my shoes on now
I might be leaving tonight
You're gonna miss me in the morning (I might be leaving tonight)
You're gonna miss me in the morning (I might be leaving tonight)

I wanna settle down, stop looking
Spend all my time not worrying
I wanna find the one to spend all of my days
I want it to be you, I'm crazy for you, babe

Ooh love, you got me so mad
I give you all of my lovin'
Best that you've ever had
Ooh love, you're not treating me right
I got my shoes on now
I might be leaving tonight
You're gonna miss me in the morning (I might be leaving tonight)
You're gonna miss me in the morning (I might be leaving tonight)
