Lipstick on my cigarette
How you used to hug the bed
The little shit that I cant forget, I wonder where you are
Still got your apartment key, voicemails that I can't delete
Man I miss how it used to be, I wonder where you are
I reminisce with the stars tonight
And I think of how we knew them all by name
But they don't shine half as bright
Ever since you walked away

If we get back together
It'll be like when I met ya
Only better can I bet ya, baby
Let's get back together
Girl I swear you are the reasons
And it's something worth believing

Ooohh (When we get together) oooh (It'll be forever)
Oooh (When we get together) yeah

If we get back together
It'll be like when I met ya
Even better can I bet ya, baby

Last call at the troubadour
Late night meals after four
Stumbling through my front door, it just don't feel the same
Can't go to our lunch spot, or grab Joe from the coffee shop
Looking down in my phone a lot, but I don't see your name
I reminisce with the stars tonight
And I think of how we knew them all by name
But they don't shine half as bright
Ever since you walked away

If we get back together
It'll be like when I met ya
Even better can I bet ya, baby
Let's get back together
Girl I swear you all the reasons
Love is something worth believing

Ooohh (When we get together) oooh (It'll be forever)
Oooh (When we get together) yeah

If we get back together
It'll be like when I met ya
Even better can I bet ya, baby

If we get back together (It'll be better)
If we get back together (It'll be better than ever)
If we get back together
If we get back together (If we get back together)

I reminisce with the stars tonight
And I think of how we knew them all by name
But they don't shine half as bright
Ever since you walked away

If we get back together
It'll be like when I met ya
Even better can I bet ya, baby
Let's get back together
Girl I swear you all the reasons
Love is something worth believing

Ooohh (When we get together) oooh (It'll be forever)
Oooh (Oh better) yeah

If we get back together
It'll be like when I met ya
Even better can I bet ya, baby
Let's get back together!
