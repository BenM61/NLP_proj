I can give you what you want
I can make your heart beat, short
I can make you ice cream
We could be a sweet team
Melting in your vice dreams, sport

I can be the source you crave
I can spell what you can't say
Chocolate-flavored love theme
Treat that treats you so mean
Covering your nights and days

let me give you what you'd like
I can make your mouth run dry
Drink me like a liquor
Come on and dip your dipper
Show me what you're here for, guy

I can give you what you want
I can make your back real taut
Fantastic flavored fancies
Sick like Sid and Nancy
Wicked as a joyride jaunt

(what you want)
I can give you what you want
(what you want)
I can give you what you want you want
(Want)
I can give you what you want
(what you want, you want)
What you, what you want now
