Hey, now did I tell you that I was goin'?
Yes, I'm leavin'
'Cause there's no room in this house
You're just too much in love with yourself

Tired of livin' in slow motion
Gonna make that bubble burst and fill the ocean
With your crocodile tears from your eyes
Instead of swimmin' against the tide

There are better things that a man can do
Than to waste his time on a no good fool like you

Falling into a hole like paradise
Falling into a hole like paradise

You say that you're really sorry
But sorry don't work when you've heard it
For the fifty-second time
You should be ready to say goodbye

Tired and you're dead and dreamin'
Baby who on earth do you think you're kidding?
Go and put another record on
I'm sick of hearin' the same old song

Don't wanna hear your little white lies
They can break the moon and decimate the sky

Falling into a hole like paradise
Falling into a hole like paradise

There are better things that a man can do
Than to waste his time on a no good fool like you

I'll be goin' away soon, only time will tell
If I'll ever be back again
I'll be goin' away soon, only time will tell
If I'll ever be back again

Falling into a hole like paradise
Falling into a hole like paradise
