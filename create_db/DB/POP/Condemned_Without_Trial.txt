Condemned without trial no chance to explain
Sentenced to be lonely despised
Condemned without trial to heartaches and pain
I thought that you demand me from the life

As heaven's my judge and the world is my jury
I'm faithful I swear that I am
Condemned without trial someday you may be
Then you'll think of me and understand
[ guitar - piano ]
As heavens my chance...
