Who's that coming down the street
Good old organ grinder Pete
Monkey dancing on a string
To the organ grinder's swing

Da-dya, da-dya, da-dya da-dya
Eenie meenie minie mo
Catch that monkey by the toe
If he hollers let him go

Eenie meenie minie mo
Ho-hum, ho-hum, ho-ho-hum, ho-hum
Swing it mister go to town
Turn the handle all around

Give that music all you got
Make it come out sweet and hot
Oh-ho, oh-ho-ho, muddy-raer, oh-ho
Poppa swings it, so does Ma

Momma swings it, so does Pa
You can swing it, so do I
I can swing it, so do you
Do-dya, da-dya, wo-beng, da-dya

Old Mr. organ grinder's goin' away now
So long Mr. organ grinder,
You coming back next Thursday?
Bring your little monkey with ya,

Oh-ho, so long Mr. organ grinder
So long, oh-ho, bye
