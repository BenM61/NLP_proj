To know, know, know him 
Is to love love love him 
Just to see him smile 
Makes my life worthwhile 
To know know know him 
Is to love love love him 
And I do 

I'll be good to him 
I'll bring love to him 
Everyone says there'll come a day 
When I'll walk alongside of him 
Yes, just to know him 
Is to love love love him 
And I do 

Why can't he see 
How blind can he be 
Someday he will see 
That he was meant for me, ooh

To know, know, know him 
Is to love love love him 
Just to see him smile 
Makes my life worthwhile 
To know, know, know him 
Is to love love love him 
And I do
