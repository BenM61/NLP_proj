We go, we go, we go, we go every night
We know, we know, we know, we know a good time
We don't, we don't, we don't, we don't ever quit
I'm pretty sure that you can't deal with it
We like, we like, we like, we like what we like
Alright, alright, alright, alright, right, alright
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight we won't quit
I'm pretty sure that you can't deal with it

Deal with it, deal with it
Deal with it, deal with it

Back of a police car
A free ride to the next bar
We're taking it too far
We took it too far
Roll up with the lights on
We're decked out in our fashion
We're crashing your party
Now it's a party

We go, we go, we go, we go every night
We know, we know, we know, we know a good time
We don't, we don't, we don't, we don't ever quit
I'm pretty sure that you can't deal with it

Deal with it, deal with it
Deal with it, deal with it
I'm pretty sure that you can't deal with it
(Na-na-na-na-na-na) Deal with it
(Na-na-na-na-na-na) Deal with it
(Na-na-na-na-na-na) Deal with it
(Na-na-na-na-na-na) 

We walk in, you stare at us
We find it hilarious
We came here to tear it up
We're here to tear it up
Lights on, we roll up
Make-up and undercuts
Blap-blap-blap-blap, blap it up
I'm pretty sure that you can't deal with it

We go, we go, we go, we go every night
We know, we know, we know, we know a good time
We don't, we don't, we don't, we don't ever quit
I'm pretty sure that you can't deal with it

We had a hard, hard time tryna figure it out
But we got it (Go and deal with it)
We had a hard, hard time tryna figure it out
But we got it (Go and deal with it)
Deal with it
(Na-na-na-na-na-na) Deal with it
(Na-na-na-na-na-na) I'm pretty sure that you can't deal with it
(Na-na-na-na-na-na) Deal with it
(Na-na-na-na-na-na) I'm pretty sure that you can't deal with it

We go, we go, we go, we go every night
(Deal with it)
We know, we know, we know, we know a good time
(I'm pretty sure that you can't deal with it)
We don't, we don't, we don't, we don't ever quit
(Deal with it)
I'm pretty sure that you can't deal with it
