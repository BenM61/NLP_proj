Do you remember when I said
She's got the papers and I've got the man
But the man that she had, that I took from her
Is not the manchild that we thought he was at all

Caught in the middle I don't know what to do
What can you do when your man is untrue
There's another man oh baby
In my life (in my life)
He looked very normal till I opened my eyes
The man I loved and married loves another guy
There's another man (Another man) in my life
Oh in my life
Oh ah

Another man is beating my time (Another man is beating my time)
Another man is lovin mine (Another man is lovin mine)
Another man is beating my time (Another man)
Another man is lovin mine (Another man is lovin mine)

(Another man is beating my time) I'm going crazy
(Another man is lovin mine) Crazy
(Another man is beating my time) Going crazy
(Another man is lovin mine)

You know you and I were together
I was so in love with you
But there was a little bit
Too much sugar and you were little too sweet
But then was a little bit
Too much sugar and you were too sweet

I think I wanna stay but I don't know if I can
Loving like I do and sharing with the man
There's another man (Another man)
In my live (in my life)
Oh I think I want to leave
But I can't swallow my pride
My midnight lover loves another guy

There's another man (Another man) in my life
In my life
Oh ah

Another man is beating my time (Another man is beating my time)
Another man is lovin mine (Another man is lovin mine)
Another man is beating my time (Another man is beating my time)
Another man is lovin mine (Another man is lovin mine)

(Another man is beating my time)
(Another man is lovin mine)
(Another man is beating my time)
(Another man is lovin mine)

You know I started notice
A definite strangeness
There was no sameness
He was changing
I had gone out one day and bought me a very, very sexy dress
And opened up my closet and it had dissapeared
Lord I hope the man is not wearing my
Oooh child

And I also pick up other little things
Like you and I making love the other night
I thought he was calling out my name
But it evidently it was not my name

And I passed him on the steps one day
And he was switching more than I was
And I even caught him holding hands
Walking right down market street
We all know what market street is
He was so desirable
And this's gonna be such a waste

You know when you think everything is in place
And what you think you have is not what you really have at all
Because in my case what I thought I had was not a entire whole man
But a facsimile there of (ohh)
Wasn't the clothing or nothin', you know, I'm not

There was a certain kind of a way that he talked to me
His voice went up
You know, at first he was talking like, YEAH BABY
Then he went hello
And it kept going up and down
And there must have been, I figured, a defect
Of not when he was created
But somewhere down the line
Something went wrong

(Another man is beating my time)
(Another man is lovin mine)
(Another man is beating my time)
(Another man is lovin mine)

Another man is beating my time (Another man is beating my time)
Another man is lovin mine (Another man is lovin mine)
Another man is beating my time (Another man is beating my time)
Another man is lovin mine (Another man is lovin mine)
