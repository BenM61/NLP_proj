'Bout this dance called the mess around
Baby dig what I'm puttin' down

You can pony with Tony
Twist with Mr. Lee
But if you're gonna mess around
Mess around with me

Do the shimmy with Timmy
Hucklebuck with Dee
But if you're gonna mess around
You better mess around with me

All the other dances you are free
But you better save, the last dance for me

You can cha cha with Charlie
Stroll with Stagger Lee
But if you're gonna mess around
Mess around with me

You can pony with Tony
Come on now

Hey the twist with Mr. Lee
Hey one more time
Round and round and around hey

But if you're gonna mess around
You better mess around with me

All the other dances you are free
But you better save the last dance for me

Hully gully with Harry
Slop with ???
But if you're gonna mess around
Hear me mess around with me

Do the birdland with Furdie
Do the chicken with ???
Watusi with Susie
Twist with my little sis
