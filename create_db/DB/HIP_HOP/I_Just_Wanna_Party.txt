Yeah (burr)
Go white girl, its ya birthday
Go white girl, its ya birthday
Yelawolf mane and Gucci
Go white girl, its ya birthday
Yelawolf mane and Gucci
Holleratche mane

So I got this twelve pack (burr)
We blowin' smoke in the air, drinkin' ice cold beer
Got ya girl in my ear sayin', I just wanna party

Trunk music got these poppers poppin' on the Richter scale
D boys on the corner droppin' quarters like a wishin' well
Ziplock in the freezer like yo momma's box of zinfandale
Sip it with ya southern bell, bet ya she wont kiss and tell
Bring them back I'm Mr. Pale, pack the pack and drink the ale
Gettin' drunk, I'm drunk as hell
Don't think I can lean my chair
Got a tooth brush for the dirty mouth motherfuckin' rappers
You don't wanna see me there
Blindside em, blindside em, bitch I'll leave you readin' brail
You can't Lady Gaga me, don't bother with the poker face
I come from the bottom, you ain't gotta put ya dope away
Got so many hook ups I could pull the motherfuckin' train
Reachin' for the bottles baby, tell me what you want again

I just wanna party
I just wanna party
I just wanna party
We blowin' smoke in the air, drinkin' ice cold beer
Got ya girl in my ear sayin'
I just wanna party
I just wanna party
I just wanna party
I just wanna party
We blowin' smoke in the air, drinkin' ice cold beer
Got ya girl in my ear sayin'
I just wanna party

Get wasted, too wasted,
So wasted its scary
Yellow canaries in my ear, they pretty
Lets party like its 1960,
I'm the E A Jimmy Hendrix
Now the hip imma hippopotamus,
I'm roarin up that rinoshorus
Shes jockin and its obvious,
I land in your metropolis
Don't know who the baby's father is,
But I don't owe no apologies
She just want a Harley,
I'm rollin' up the Marley,
I'm drunk as Paul Mcartney
I'm aided by the shawty
I'm Gucci Mane not pootie tang,
I put it down, don't pick it up
Advice to you, don't pick on us,
Me and Yelawolf got crazy guns
We came here with 5 of 'em,
We gon' leave here with 9 of 'em

That's 14, I'm keepin' 'em around,
I'm goin' til I get tired of em

I just wanna party
I just wanna party
I just wanna party
We blowin' smoke in the air, drinkin' ice cold beer
Got ya girl in my ear sayin'
I just wanna party
I just wanna party
I just wanna party
I just wanna party
We blowin' smoke in the air, drinkin' ice cold beer
Got ya girl in my ear sayin'
I just wanna party

Cocaine on the table wish the rappa got em choppin' logs
Twenty dolla' bills all rolled up, Wiz Khalifas rollin' pot
Jackie Chan is rollin' rollin', Yelawolf is powin' powin'
Slow motion got hos in motion, I think it's the perfect time
To put em in the mood, to put em in the car
Take em to the house and (what)
Take em to the moon, take em to the mouth
How we do it down south and (what)
I'm always going going,
Ghettovison is sewing, plowing, growing, growing
Crop dusting from a Boeing
Catfish Billy, on ya grill(ey)
Cook it up, make a meal(ey)
Gettin' stupid, gettin' silly
Drinkin' beer(ey), also chile
Fucked up but I'll tell you that I can't complain
Yelawolf and Gucci Mane keepin' yo bitch in a tame

I just wanna party
I just wanna party
I just wanna party
We blowin' smoke in the air, drinkin' ice cold beer
Got ya girl in my ear sayin'
I just wanna party
I just wanna party
I just wanna party
I just wanna party
We blowin' smoke in the air, drinkin' ice cold beer
Got ya girl in my ear sayin'
I just wanna party

Bama!
We just wanna party (Ha ha ha)
Yellow, Gucci (Burr)
That's hard
