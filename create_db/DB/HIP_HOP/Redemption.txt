If you had a second chance in life, what would you do?
Would you put the pills down? Throw out the lean too?
Treat you baby mama right and make way for your kids
Peace with your enemies, keep the water under the bridge
I think about if my motorcycle crash was fatal
Broken bones, internal bleedin', stressed on the table going through surgery
Two machines helpin' me breathe, sorry mama I wanna stay but I gotta leave
I see my funeral pat I see some lyin', some cryin' and some givin' dap
I see false claimers, strangers and foes with their head in their laps
I see more division 
I see some of them showing up just to post a picture like they was my nigga
Instagram's a dead man's best friend
Everybody lookin' for likes but wasn't likin' you when
You needed somethin' to hold on dealin' with life stress
Glad them angels came in surgery said, "I'm not done yet"

I know saints, I know sinners, I know bosses
I know pain, I know veins, I know losses
My loyalty's sensitive so please don't cross me
My loyalty's sensitive so please don't cross me
I came to redeem myself, all I need is God's help
These are millions of miracles, show me the real you, the real truth

If I had a second chance in life, this what I'd do
I'd buy you flowers, talk to you for hours, give you truth
I'd listen to you when you're hurt, I should've went to church with you
But my credentials didn't work, I still should've worked with you
I should've left them lil' hoes alone and came home
But I blamed the moments on you, though I was in the wrong
You checked my phone and I checked you 'bout it
We never talked it over, instead we sexed 'bout it
I said, "I'm comin' over," you turned up flexed 'bout it
I hit yo mama phone she said "Y'all get it together" she don't know what we on
My response was whatever I'm ego trippin' hotever
I hate to see you goin' she gave me that dial tone
I should've gave you more trust, more love, no lies, more us
'Cause when my motorcycle crashed and everyone left
It was that angel at surgery sayin' "I ain't done yet"
Real shit

I know saints, I know sinners, I know bosses
I know pain, I know veins, I know losses
My loyalty's sensitive so please don't cross me
My loyalty's sensitive so please don't cross me
I came to redeem myself, all I need is God's help
These are millions of miracles, show me the real you, the real truth
