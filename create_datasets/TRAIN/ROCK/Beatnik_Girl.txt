We went to a picnic and
She was my beatnik girl
We talked about statues and
Then we went back to her house
And then we sat down
On the ground
And she played some modern jazz
And I knew she was the one
'cause she was reading Naked lunch
She's into Kandinsky
Has all of Klaus Kinsky's films
Like it or not
It's a shock that
She likes to rock
And I can't deny
Her love
'cause I'm sure she came from above
And I knew she was the one
'cause she was reading Naked lunch
All dressed in black
It's a fact
She's my beatnik girl
She's much more brainy than me
She's my beatnik girl
All dressed in black
It's a fact
She's my beatnik girl
She's much more brainy than me
She's my beatnik girl
She goes to college and
She wears the nice shoes
She wears a polo neck jumper
And she's really cool
And I feel so good
Inside
When I see her beatnik behind
And I knew she was the one
'cause she was reading Naked lunch
All dressed in black
It's a fact
She's my beatnik girl
She's much more brainy than me
She's my beatnik girl
All dressed in black
It's a fact
She's my beatnik girl
She's much more brainy than me
She's my beatnik girl
She goes to college and
She wears the nice shoes
She wears a polo neck jumper
And she's really cool
And I feel so good
Inside
When I see her beatnik behind
And I knew she was the one
'cause she was reading Naked lunch
All dressed in black
It's a fact
She's my beatnik girl
She's much more brainy than me
She's my beatnik girl
