Feeling the past moving in
Letting a new day begin
Hold to the time that you know
You don't have to move on to let go

Add to the memory you keep
Remember when you fall asleep
Hold to the love that you know
You don't have to give up to let go

Remember turning on the the night
And moving through the morning light
Remember how it was with you
Remember how you pulled me through
I remember
I remember
I remember
I remember
I remember
I remember
I remember
I remember

Feeling the past moving in
Letting a new day begin
Hold to the time that you know
You don't have to move on to let go add to the memory you keep

Remember when you fall asleep
Hold to the love that you know
You don't have to give up to let go remember how it was with you
Remember how you pulled me through I remember feeling the past moving in

Letting a new day begin
Hold to the time that you know
You don't have to move on to let go add to the memory you keep

Remember when you fall asleep
Hold to the love that you know
You don't have to give up to let go remember turning on the the night

And moving through the morning light
Remember how it was with you
Remember how you pulled me through
I remember
I remember
I remember
I remember
I remember
I remember
I remember
