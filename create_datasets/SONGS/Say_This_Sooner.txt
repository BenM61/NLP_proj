I can't believe I didn't say this sooner
I'll just believe that I was all displaced
I'll get to speaking, let you know how I feel
I'll get to judging, make you see my appeal

No one will ever see things the way I do
No one will try
All my friends think that I'm gone, but I swear
I swear I'm not
I swear I'm not!

This makes me feel that
I'll never be quite normal
This makes me act like
I'll never get out alive
I'll get to acting, make you all believe me
I'll get to faking show you all how to grieve

No one will ever see things the way I do
No one will try
All my friends think that I'm gone, but I swear
I swear I'm not
I swear I'm not!

In and out is where it gets back to the place it does
Makes me feel like I just want to feel, just like it touch

No one will ever see things the way I do
No one will try
All your friends say that your gone, but you swear
I swear I'm not

No one will ever see things the way I do
No one will try
All my friends think that I'm gone, but I swear
I swear I'm not
I swear I'm not!
