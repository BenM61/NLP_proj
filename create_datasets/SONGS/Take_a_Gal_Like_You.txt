Take a girl like you down to New Orleans,
Dress you in a dress of red,
Get you a house at the back of town, Baby,
Get you a folding bed, yes, buy you a folding bed

Buy you an great big diamond ring,
Buy you a dress of blue,
Buy you a pair of high heeled shoes, Baby,
I'll be true to you, yes, I'll be true to you

Tell me
Where did you get your pretty little dress?
Shoes that you wear so fine?
Well I got my dress from a railroad man, baby
Shoes from a man down the line,
Yessir
Shoes from a man down the line,

Tell me
Who's gonna shoe your pretty little feet?
Who is gonna glove your hand?
Who's gonna kiss your rosy cheek, baby?
Who's gonna be your man?
Tell me
Who's gonna be your man?

Well
Papa's gonna shoe my pretty little feet
Mamma's gonna glove my hand
Sister's gonna kiss my rosy cheek, baby,
And you can be my man,
Yessir
You can be my man

Buy you a great big diamond ring,
Buy you a dress of blue,
Buy you a pair of high heeled shoes, baby
And I'll be true to you,
Yessir
I'll be true to you
