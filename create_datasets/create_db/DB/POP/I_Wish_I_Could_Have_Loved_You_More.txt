I wish I could have loved you more
I wish I could have loved you more
I wish I could have loved you more
I wish I could have loved you more

And ever since that day
I had to say goodbye
How I long to change my mind
But I know it won't be right

And in so many ways
You were made to be my man
Why i had to make you cry
I hope you understand

I wish I could have loved you more

I wish I could have loved you more
I wish I could have loved you more
I wish I could have loved you more

And ever since that day
I had to say goodbye
How I long to change my mind
But I know it won't be right
And every since that day
I had to say goodbye

I wish I could have loved you more
I wish I could have loved you more
