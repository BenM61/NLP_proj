I can see you coming baby
For so long you've been running
Wish I could just save you
Just one time
I'm feeling my last one's gone and done and done and done

If we could only see
The wonder of it all
And all that we can be
In a lifetime
Baby, you will always be
Forever in my heart
And love will set us free if we just try

I can feel you trying
For so long you've been hiding
Wish I could've told you
That one time
I'm feeling my last ones gone and done and done and done

If we could only see
The wonder of it all
And all that we can be
In a lifetime
Baby, you will always be
Forever in my heart
And love will set us free if we just try

When you down on the ground
And you're barely holding on
All you need is love
To keep from going under
For a while you've been trying to be strong an never fall
But it's all right sometimes
It can only get better

If we could only see
The wonder of it all
And all that we can be
In a lifetime
Baby, you will always be
Forever in my heart
And love will set us free if we just try
