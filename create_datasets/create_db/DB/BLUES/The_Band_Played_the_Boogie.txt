The high school hooker was once a good looker
The teenage queen, now she wants a gas cooker
The union-boss' busy buying odd stocks
The army's outta work, sold the countries on the rocks
Take it while it's there, don't grieve when it's gone
The band played Boogie and the people danced on

Super high, Superfly has gone underground
The king bought a car, had to trade in his crown
Andy Warhole made a movie about Peter Pan
And Miss Liberation has found herself a man
Take it while it's there, don't grieve when it's gone
The band played Boogie and the people danced on

The band played the Boogie and the people danced on
Band played the Boogie, band played the Boogie
Band played the Boogie, band played the Boogie
The band played the Boogie and the people danced on ....
