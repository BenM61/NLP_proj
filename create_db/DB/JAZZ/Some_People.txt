Some people like walkin in the rain 
Some people like to get way on a plane 
Some people like to party every night, 
But all I want to do 

Is baby stay home with you 
Some poeple like chillin at the beach 
Some people they don't practice what They preach 
Some people like crusin in there cars 

But all I want to do is baby stay home With you 
All I really want to do 
On days I'm with out you (without you) 
You still linger on my mind 

There is no substitution 
You are where I want to spend my time 
Baby 

Some people like workin day n night 
Some people they are lookin for a fight 
Some people they just dream there life Away 
But baby all I want to do is baby stay Home with you 

All I really want to do 
On days I'm without you (without you) 
You still linger on my mind 
There is no subsitution (no) 

You are where I want to spend my time 
Some people they like workin day n night 
Some people are lookin for a fight 
Some poeple they like to dream there Life away 

But all I want to do 
Is baby stay home with you
