Rock, Dust, Light, Star
And it's coming at you baby

I'm a man on the moon
I hope I don't come back too soon
Am I the only one to see the light?
No use in getting down upon your knees tonight
So I don't feel love
Because I got no faith
I've seen those twisted lies thrown back into my face
I've heard the crazy doctrines of the human race
I must be alone

How could it be
Your gift to me
A salvo of heavy artillery
It's nothing but your war
You can call it what you like
I know where I'm from
And it's cold and dark
'Cause all the sinners are just saints without the sparks
I'm having trouble telling them apart
Oh yeah

I'm coming at you
Rock, Dust, Light, Star
Coming at you baby
Thirty-six-thousand miles an hour
Rock, Dust, Light, Star
Coming at you baby
What you made of what you are

Now look and see
Those stars for you and me
Waiting like silent killers in the night
Atomic legions that you can never fight
I've never felt I ever prayed
Don't have to join in with the other slaves
I'm not the only one who feels betrayed
Yeah

See the more I think about it
I'm born against the grain
Ooh ooh, I won't be born again
Salvation's coming from on high
(Coming at you baby through the sky
From on high, yeah)

Rock, Dust, Light, Star
Coming at you baby thirty-six-thousand miles an hour
Rock, Dust, Light, Star
Coming at you baby
What you made of what you are
Rock, Dust, Light, Star
Coming at you baby thirty-six-thousand miles an hour
Rock, Dust, Light, Star
Coming at you baby
What you made of what you are

Rock, Dust, Light, Star
Rock, Dust, Light, Star

I'm a square pig
In a round hole
Maybe there's no place left for my wounded soul
Maybe the king of king's finally lost control of it

Coming at you baby
Rock, Dust, Light, Star
Coming at you baby
Thirty-six-thousand miles an hour

Hit it
(Salvation's coming)
Coming at you baby
Thirty-six-thousand miles an hour (from on high)
(Salvation's coming)
Coming at you baby
What you made of what you are
Look up and see those stars for you and me
Look up and see
Rock, Dust, Light, Star
Coming at you baby
From on high

Rock, Dust, Light, Star
