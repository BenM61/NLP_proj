Coming loose, at the seams
Blind spots, voices
Controls gone, I'm like a balloon
Cut it out, emotion

Distance, it grows now
You don't, reach for me
All I got, all I got
Is my scars

Save me give me wings to fly
Make me young reason to fight
Suddenly we'll cross a home
Remember me into the night

Kiss me then I'll wake up
Kiss me then I'll wake up
Kiss me then I'll wake up
Kiss me then I'll wake up
Kiss me then I'll wake up
Fairy tales make up

Headlight, black demons
Peering in my hollow core
Grudges they're strangling
and splinters and dry skin

Streetlights they see me
The whole world will reach for me
All I got, all I got
Is my scars

Save me give me wings to fly
Make me young reason to fight
Suddenly we'll cross a home
Remember me into the night

Kiss me then I'll wake up
Kiss me then I'll wake up
Kiss me then I'll wake up
Kiss me then I'll wake up
Kiss me then I'll wake up
Fairy tales make up

I'll kiss then you'll wake up
Don't want to meet your maker
And you don't believe in fairy tales
Well today I'm gonna make ya

'Cause I've come here to save ya
Finna none of that miss I'ma take ya
I can rap I can rhyme like karma
Be your night in armor

Oh no I ain't got no Porsche
Just give me a shield and a sword and a horse
And I'll come ridin' ridin' ridin'
Give me a little one on the back

I'ma tell a lie and get you on back
I'ma tell a lie and get you on back
It's gone right from fiction to fact
I'm gonna take you out this world

Kiss me then I'll wake up
Kiss me then I'll wake up
Kiss me then I'll wake up
Kiss me then I'll wake up
Kiss me then I'll wake up
Fairy tales make up

Kiss me
Kiss me
Kiss me
Kiss me
Kiss me
Fairy tales make up
