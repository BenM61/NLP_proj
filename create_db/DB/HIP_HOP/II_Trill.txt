Yo bun, u know many were called &
Few were cho0sen

Da future president
Congratulations
By the way I need u to send a trill message to sum
And a subliminal one to other
About this throwin' rocks
And being behind your head biznes
Please let them know
That we goin' give them, why they ask for

Mayne I'm to hard for all of you soft niggas
To real for most of you lames
To hard to be in this rap shit in da streets it's da same
To throwed up in this game
To true to my hood

I'm to down to get down
So lets get it understood
To bad to be good
To golden not to glisten

To focused for footboy's to f*ck off my mission
To smart not to listen
When g's pull my goal
Bout dem white folks that's listing

And watching my move
Theres real shit u can quote
I'm to gangster, to street
So don't run up to fast
'Cause I'm to strapped wit dat heat

I'm to dirty to be neat
To gorilla to be monkey
To fly to stay grounded

To fresh to be funky
Too many licks for junkies
To much work for flippers
To much dro for smoking

To much apphademphas
No need for u to trip
Cause we bring to much drama
Got to many killas
Put dat on ma mama

To trill to to to trill
All about ma dollar bills
And even if I tried
I can never fall off
To much money on my mind

All this penitentiary skills

If I retire you youngins
Would know what to do wit da game

Man I'm to serious for dis play playa's
To much bread to make
For me to fuckk all my time
On these cats dats to fake

They say to many ways
And too many to 'em
Your homeboy cant get it
I'm too ready to do it to em

To many gun out here get pulled
To many sludges out here get bust
Leave your brain matter bone fragments
And dick up in da dust

To many niggas have been crushed
To let your bitch ass come try me!
Got smart game got gun play
You be screaming wammy!!

To close don't get by me

'Bout these bodies we catchin'

To light up in your britches
Your to much dick ride'n

To much money on my mind

Man I'm to sick of all this sweet shit
'Cause I'm can to much smiling
To much for gas posing
And punk ass provilng

To many niggas be frontin
Like they got da town on lock
And to much money in d bank
And to many hoes is on dey jock

But u smoke too many of dem rocks
Dat u prayed me you done sold
Ive done been out on dem blocks
And u ain't got to much control

Man your workers ain't dat cool
Man they sum hoes
More un-listen
And they to ready to fold

Cause they cant take too much presser
Let me mash on em
Yes son, they in violation
Go get em?

It won't be to long for we mop up da floor wit 'em
It's rap a lot for life
We've been done here to long
For these haters to brings us down

We to right, they to wrong
Too black and too strong
To go on life to prong
To ready for da rugters

To close to my trunk
We can pop or we can chunk
We can blast or we can go
From da shoulders

Bitch I tried to told you
But if u ain't know
Bitch I'm to trill!
