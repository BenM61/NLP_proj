You're not pretty enough
You're not skinny enough
You're not healthy enough
You're not shaking at our touch

You're not lonely enough
You're not holy enough
You're not saying too much
About what you think we want

So shock me
So shock me
So shock me

Well you spend the night
I'll take my life
We'll close our eyes
We'll be dead by sunrise

You're not dreaming too much
You're not sleeping enough
You're not burning enough
Of your body to be loved

So shock me
So shock me
So shock me

Well you spend the night
I'll take my life
We'll close our eyes
We'll be dead by sunrise

You spend the night
I'll take my life
We'll close our eyes
We're so uptight

You spend the night
I'll take my life
We'll kill our time
We'll be dead by sunrise
