Staggering home, the headlights throw a shadow up and upon
Friends and loved ones that have done no wrong,
But no longer mean anything to me.
Oh am I mumbling on, into a crystal glass that echoes a song?
The enticement invites you along a path of exterior colour.

But come the morning, shivering and contorting,
To border on the brink for just another sink - oh take me down,
For one more round.

Oh, involve me in libation, stick a rock in my foundation,
I pick all my relations, put me on probation - oh I'll take you down,
For one last round.

Oh, Lovestruck, I've fallen for a lamppost,
Giving her my utmost, spilling out my deepest feelings.
Lovestruck, I've fallen for a lamppost,
Giving her my utmost, spilling out my deepest feelings.
Now all I want to do is snuggle up to you.
A night-cap in the early morning dew.

Look, what have I become? Dispensing myself so far and from
But gazing out I waved the night boat on,
For now it's heaven in deepest Tottenham.

Oh, what have I done to deserve this fate? It's all going wrong
Even the cab fare has been and gone
And now I'm lagging in deepest Tottenham.

But come the morning, shivering and contorting,
To border on the brink for just another sink - oh take me down,
For one more round.

Yeah, Lovestruck, I've fallen for a lamppost,
Giving her my utmost, spilling out my deepest feelings.
Lovestruck, I've fallen for a lamppost,
Giving her my utmost, spilling out my deepest feelings.

Fight me, fight me, strike me down with lightning,
I've given in to fighting.
Now all I want to do is get up close to you.
A night-cap in the early morning dew.

Oh, Lovestruck, I've fallen for a lamppost,
Giving her my utmost, spilling out my deepest feelings.
Lovestruck, I've fallen for a lamppost,
Giving her my utmost, spilling out my deepest feelings.

Lovestruck, I've fallen for a lamppost,
I'm giving it my utmost, I've fallen for a lamppost,
With my deepest feelings.

Now all I want to do is snuggle up to you.
A night-cap in the early morning dew.
