Here we're and standing our ground
And we won't be moved by what they say

So we'll shout (shout!)
As loud as we can
And we'll shout (shout!)
'till they hear our demands
Money is what we need, not complacency

Read my lips and they will tell you
Enough is enough is enough is enough
Finding cures is not the only solution
And it's not a case of sinner absolution

So we'll fight (fight!)
For love and with pride
And we'll fight (fight!)
Standing together for the
Right to live and die with dignity

Read my lips and they will tell you
Enough is enough is enough is enough
The power within
We can use it to win
So we'll shout (shout!)
As loud as we can
And we'll fight (fight!)
'Till they meet our demands
Money is what we need, not complacency

Read my lips and they will tell you
Enough is enough is enough is enough
