I feel so good today
Even though I can't find my way
Your heart's been keeping you away
Don't be afraid 'coz I know that

Oh, soon there'll come a day
When you would turn around and say
My heart is such a lonely place
Gotta tell you now how I'm feeling

I feel so good today
But what about tomorrow? Come on

I feel so good today
Even though I can't find my way
Your heart's been keeping you away
Don't be afraid, 'coz I know that

Oh, soon there'll come a day
When you would turn around and say
My heart is such a lonely place
Gotta tell you now how I'm feeling

I feel so good today
But what about tomorrow?

Tomorrow's come for me
But it's Infinity, I seem
My heart's been watching over me
Gotta listen up 'coz I know now

That this is not a game
Oh, how I've tried to explain
My feeling can't remain the same
Gotta sort it out 'coz I am older

Tomorrow comes again
Like a dry pants on artic string
My feeling's still remain the same
Gotta twist one up from one another
