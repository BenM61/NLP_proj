You are my flesh 
You are my bones 
You are endless shifting tones 
You are my eyes you are my ears 
You are the salt within my tears 
You are my noise you are my sound 
You are the dark and shifting ground 
You are my yes you are my no 
You are rarely wrong i know

So move with me 
With me removed

You are my down you are my up 
You're so now never give up 
You are my last you are my first 
You are my good luck and my worst 
You are my love you are my pay 
You see green when i see grey 
You are my bad i am your good 
There are words misunderstood

So move with me 
With me removed

You are my fingers i am your hand 
I am your three man one man band 
You are my breath i am your tongue 
I feel old when you look young 
I am your feet you are my toes 
Where you come from no-one knows 
I am your vision 
You are my scent 
I am borrowed you are lent

I am nervous you are calm 
I see lines upon your palm 
I am close we are near 
Though the ending is not clear 
We are separate we are one 
The division has begun 
You are my future i am your past 
Even music will not last

So move with me 
With me removed

You and us together 
Together in this room 
You will not remember 
This passing moment soon

I am nervous you are calm 
I see lines upom your palm 
I am close we are near 
Though the ending is not here 
We are separate we are one 
The division has begun 
You are my future i am your past 
Even music will not last

So move with me 
With me removed

You and us together 
Together in this room 
You will not remember 
This passing moment soon
