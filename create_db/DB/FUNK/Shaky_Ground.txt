Too much time is spent on the dead 
All the places found us back to live in his head 
Like the bones of a lover on a dying bed 
With all the nothings that he never said 

Mr. Motorcycle must have missed his plane 
Thousand miles an hour ?
Could've been ugly, could've been a shame 
Turned him around by calling out his name 

An young prince charming wrote the book of love 
Said the words came from a place above 
And he flew it on the wings of a virgin love 
But nobody knows what he was speaking of 

It all goes around 
Some break free, some break down 
Some get lost and some get found 
Though I stand upon shaky ground 
I know it all goes around 

Well, John, the liar, he talks endlessly 
He's traveled 'cross the world and the seven seas 
He makes up places to go and people to be 
Sometimes I think that he made up me 

Mississippi singers must've said it best 
There ain't nothing worse than emptiness 
You got an empty bottle and an empty chest 
Nothing more, always less 

It all goes around 
Some break free, some break down 
Some get lost and some get found 
Although I stand upon shaky ground 
I know it all goes around, alright 

Wake up, child and there's a work to do 
The crop is getting thin and the chickens too 
Better get moving while the day is new 
I know you got something left in you 

I know it all goes around 
Some break free and some break down 
Some get lost trying to get found 
Though I stand upon shaky ground 
I know it all goes around 

Round and round, and round and round 
Round and round, and round and round 
Round and round, and round and round 
Round and round, and round and round 
Round and round, and round and round 
Round and round, and round and round
