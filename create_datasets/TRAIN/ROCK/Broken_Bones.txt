When the day is done, we can have our fun
When we see the sun go down
We start our night out on the town 
Bundle up it's cold 
Let's hit the street we're getting old 
We're wearing ourselves thin 
And tomorrow night we'll do it again
We're the broken bones, whoa
We're the broken bones, whoa 
We're the broken bones 
BMX all night 
Goosetops, rooftops, midnight flights 
When you see us from the hill 
Move yourself, we ride to kill 
We'll ride in your town too 
Cause we're a touring crew
From Seattle to L.A 
Chicago to New York to Tampa Bay
We're the broken bones, whoa 
We're the broken bones, whoa
We're the broken bones, whoa
We're the broken bones, whoa
We're the broken bones, whoa 
We're the broken bones, whoa 
We're the broken bones!!!
