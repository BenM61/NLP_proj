Baby, how long
Baby how long
Have that ev'nin train been gone
Baby, how long, how long, baby how long

Hear it was so
Can't see no train
But deep in my heart I feel and achin' pain
And that's a-how long, how long, babe how long

Into the station
Look up at the board
Next train around
Strawberry Road
How long, how, woo, baby how long

'Make it wail ev'rybody'     
'Yeah, so sweet'

Down atta station
With my head hung down
Lookin' at my sugar, when she leave this town
Baby, how long, how long, baby how long

I ain't got no money
Buy a ticket on a train
But I'll ride de blinds, baby 
Be back home, again
Well, how long, how long, baby how long

See me comin'
Gon get some plow work    
I'll cut your liver
Plug your heartache 
Been so long, woo swoo, baby how long

'Sonny, wail about it'

Feelin' bad, I'm lookin' sad
Thinkin' bout the bad luck, Sonny
I once have had 
But how long, how long, honey how long

See the green grass, growin' on a hill
Never seen no green grass on a dollar bill
How long, how long, baby how long

Lower you, baby
To a hollow tree
Way you treat me
Come back to you
Hoo, low, hoo, woo, baby gone

'Make it wail ev'rybody, now'

Feel so disgusted, I feel so blue
Sometimes Sonny, I don't know
What in the world I'm gonna do
Now, how long, how long, yeah how long

See that little house, sitting on the hill
You don't love me, goin try another who will
How long, how long baby, how long              

See my baby, tell her I'll be runnin' home
I've been worried, ever since she been gone
How long, how, woo, baby how long

'Love to see ya'

'Play for me, now'
