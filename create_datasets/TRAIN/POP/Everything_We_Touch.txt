I lived inside the hidden bay, 
And time used to pass so slow
I raised dragons by my side, 
But I, I had to let them go

Days of ashes and nights of flames
A thirstful beauty then thirstful games
Do you need to seal my soul, 
Just let me know
When you get out

Everything we touch turns to gold at night
In the dark we make it special, make it justified
Everything we touch turns to gold at night
There's a ghost of another she, and there's a lower light

Now there's a black star on my sun, 
I can't make it go away
Asking what I chose wasting my time
Until I knew your name

Days of ashes and nights of flames
A thirstful beauty then thirstful games
Do you need to seal my soul, 
Just let me know
When you get out

Everything we touch turns to gold at night
In the dark we make it special, make it justified
Everything we touch turns to gold at night
There's a ghost of another she, and there's a lower light

When you get out 
Time we make it special, make it justified 

Everything we touch turns to gold at night
In the dark we make it special, make it justified
Everything we touch turns to gold at night
There's a ghost of another she, and there's a lower light
