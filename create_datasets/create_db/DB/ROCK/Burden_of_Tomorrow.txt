Oh I was sent to find the lonesome place
Where I was lost but left to trace
By carving riddles on the lonesome vine.

Oh but rumor has it that I wasn't born,
I just walked in one frosty morn.
Into the vision of some vacant mind.

Oh once I held a pony by its flying mane,
And once I called the shadow in the turning game
But I will fight this stranger that you should fear
So I won't be a burden of tomorrow dear

Aw Xavier's on the border of the sun
Swings on the chambers of your guns.
And tries to shoot the chord and light the path.

Aw but hell I'm just a blind man on the plains,
I drink my water when it rains,
And live by chance among the lightning strikes.

Oh once I held a glacier to an open flame
And once I felt like wildcat in the fallen game.
But I will fight this stranger that you should fear
So I won't be a burden of tomorrow dear.

Oh the singers on the edge to feed the canyons mouth
They will go on forever til they sing you out of time.
But I will fight this stranger that you should fear
So I won't be a burden of tomorrow dear.
