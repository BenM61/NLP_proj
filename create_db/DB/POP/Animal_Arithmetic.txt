Wake up, comb my hair
Making food disappear
Riding bikes, making out
Elephants run you down

You and I run away, blushing cheeks
Howling wolves, colourful fireworks

Every time, everyone, everything's full of life
Everyday, everywhere, people are so alive

We should all be (Oh Oh Oh) alive!
We should all be (Oh Oh Oh) alive!

Horfandi, þegjandi, tala við, skríðandi
Dreymandi, strjúka af, koma við ekki má
Mála á líkama, spilað á renglandi
Hlaupandi! Leikandi!

Get it on, let it out, fucking and spúandi
Get it on, let it out, fucking and kæfandi

We should all be (Oh Oh Oh) alive!
Exist all in love, in life!
We should all be (Oh Oh Oh) alive!
Let's not stop, let's grow and live!

I see you colourful, I see you in the trees
I see you spiritful, you're in the breeze
I see it in your hands, tree fingers draw a beam
I see you in the sand, roll down the stream

I see you in the trees, I see you colourful
I see you in the breeze, you're spiritful
Tree fingers draw a beam, I see it in your hands
You're rolling down the stream, you're in the sand

I see you colourful, I see you in the trees
I see you spiritful, You're in the breeze
I see it in your hands, tree fingers draw a beam
I see you in the sand, roll down the stream
