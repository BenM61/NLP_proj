Do you remember the day
When you walked away
I never had a chance
To tell my story

I'd been out all night
Had too much to drink
And couldn't think

I just lost my job
And thought that I'd been robbed
And feeling lonely was to blame
For the lipstick stains

Just let me start tonight
Setting everything right
With you and me, baby
Lyrics courtesy Top40db.
Ooh, wee

I'm not too proud to plead
I'll beg on bended knee
To get you back, baby
Yes, I will

You got me doing time
Going out of my mind
???

Honey, you got the key
Won't you set me free
Girl, have pity on me

I'll make the change
I'll rearrange everything
Cause there's no light without you

I got my head together
I promise never to
Hurt you again, baby

Let me start tonight
Setting everything right
With you and me, baby
Ooh, girl, ooh, honey

I'm not too proud to plead
I'll beg on bended knees
To get you back home, darling
Yes, I will

There's somebody out there lonely tonight
And for one reason or another
You're having trouble with your lover
Well, here's a lesson for free
Already been tested by me

If there's somebody you want bad enough
You won't mind pushing aside your pride
Cause whatever's needed to get over
You shoot your best shot
Give it all you got

It all depends on how much
You want it and how bad
Cause it definitely can be had
That's why I don't mind begging
Oh, yeah, for my lady

Now I want you all to sing along with me
Maybe my baby will feel sorry for me
And come on back home, right here

(Let me start tonight, let me start tonight)
Oh, oh, yeah
(Let me start tonight, let me start tonight)
Think I need to call my lady and tell her

To let me start tonight
Setting everything right
With you and me, baby
Oh, yeah

I'm not too proud to plead
I'll beg on bended knees
To get you back home, darling

You just let me start tonight...
