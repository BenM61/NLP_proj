You're not my Yoko Ono
You said those words to me
You say some hurtful things now
None cut so deeply

Those visions of beauty 
Those visions haunt me
Illusions of hope
And they drive me crazy

You're not my Yoko Ono
You said those words to me
You have too many problems
Always in therapy

Lovesick

You are a constant patient
You stop me being mean
Give me some inspiration
Is that why you hit me

Lovesick
Lovesick

Those visions of beauty
Those visions haunt me
But I like them
I'll keep them
I'll just go crazy

You're not my Yoko Ono
You said those words to me
You say some hurtful things now
None cut so deeply

Lovesick
Lovesick
Lovesick
