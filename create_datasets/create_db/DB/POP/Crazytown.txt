With a coat hanger for an antenna
Reception won't get any better
The rain's coming down and the wipers keep time

It's easy if we don't panic
Without calling Satan's mechanic
We'll get there fast ignoring all of the signs

Well, if we leave this crazy town
500 miles 'fore the sun goes down
I'll know we're there by the look in your eyes
Quit this excuse for a life

You can't live your life by the letter
And numbers don't make it much better
The glittering prize will lose its shine every time

With a coat hanger for an antenna
Reception can only get better
We'll drop them a line to the world a short note
(is all they wrote)

If we leave this crazy town
500 miles 'fore the sun goes down
I'll know we're there by the look in your eyes
Leave all our troubles behind
Quit this excuse for a life

This ain't just fantasy
This is just you and me
I might be dreaming now
But I think I know you
If we leave this crazy town ...

I'll know we're there by the look in your eyes

If we leave this crazy town
There's a moon coming up as the sun goes down
I'll know we're there by the look in your eyes
Quit this excuse for a life
Leave all our troubles behind
Quit this excuse for a life
