Waiting at the station, looking with the white eye
Letting the world go by
Headphones on, I make a dedication
Universe told goodbye
Come around the corner, Cleopatra's daughter
Daydream come to life
Struck with the feeling, golden healing
Gliding in a kite

Being with you,
I feel DRUNK ALL THE TIME
I cannot get you, get you out of my mind
Got nonsense on my pace
Got easy of my face
Being with you,
I feel DRUNK ALL THE TIME

It's happening again,
I thought I had it straight
I thought I knew it all
But all it took one glace to put my good intentions fall
With you I found that champions sound up
Journeys through the night
Struck with the feeling, golden healing
Gliding on a kite

Being with you,
I feel DRUNK ALL THE TIME
I cannot get you, get you out of my mind
Got nonsense on my pace
Got easy of my face
Being with you,
I feel DRUNK ALL THE TIME

Being with you,
I feel DRUNK ALL THE TIME
Being with you,
I feel DRUNK ALL THE TIME
Intoxify, make my spirit rise
Things we cannot hide
Thinking that you didn't mind

Being with you,
I feel DRUNK ALL THE TIME
I cannot get you, get you out of my mind
Got nonsense on my pace
Got easy of my face
Being with you,
I feel DRUNK ALL THE TIME
Being with you,
I feel DRUNK ALL THE TIME
Being with you,
I feel DRUNK ALL THE TIME
Being with you,
I feel DRUNK ALL THE TIME
Being with you,
I feel DRUNK ALL THE TIME
