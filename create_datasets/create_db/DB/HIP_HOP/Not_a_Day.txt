Not a moment goes by that I'm not thinkin' of you...

Oh-oh, not a day goes by, not an hour goes by,
not a moment goes by that I'm not thinkin' of you!
Oh, not a day goes by, not an hour goes by!
Not a moment goes by that I'm not thinkin' of you!

Every time I close my eyes, you are right there,
in my mind, in my mind, there's a special place for you!

Oh, oh, oh!!! Diddy sing it!!! 

Oh!! Not a day goes by, not an hour goes by, yeah,
not a moment goes by that I'm not thinkin' of you, oh...
