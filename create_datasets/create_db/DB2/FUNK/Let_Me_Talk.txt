Fifty million voices mumbling from the street
Talking about the eighties and who it will mistreat
Now, Joseph Worken Hardy, checkin' out the jive
Glancing at his pocketbook, inflation is alive

I (I) stand tall (stand tall), let me talk (let me talk), let me talk, yeah
I (I) stand tall (stand tall), let me talk (let me talk), let me talk

Now Miss Sophisticated, your nose up in the air
Trying to find excitement, in the labels that you wear
Now, I may disappoint you, with the things I say
But deep inside, a message burns withing me everyday

I (I) stand tall (stand tall), let me talk (let me talk), let me talk, yeah
I (I) stand tall (stand tall), let me talk (let me talk), let me talk, ey yeah

We're all the same, with different names
Will you play your role, just as you've been told

Let me talk, let me talk, let me talk, let me talk

Let me talk, let me talk

Won't you come on down, put your feet on the ground
Get in touch with you, let your love come through

World automotives chase the Arab wheel
Partnerships on nuclear, trying to make a deal
Now where does it lead to
I'm sure the question flows
Through many minds around the world
I'm sure nobody knows

I, I
I stand tall, let me talk, let me talk
I stand tall, let me talk, let me talk
I, I,
I stand tall, let me talk, let me talk
