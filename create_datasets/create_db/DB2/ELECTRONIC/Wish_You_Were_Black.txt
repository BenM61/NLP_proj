Degradation takes a soul potential 
The woman ain't to blame 
Infiltrate the morning's passing hours 
But love remains the same 

I know I wish you were black 
But ain't no use you pretending 
She ain't ever coming back 
To put you on the right track 

All American humour 
With all American smile 
Love is on the horizon baby 
But no one can reply, well, well 

I know I wish you were black 
But ain't no use singing gospel 
She ain't ever coming back 
To put you on the right track 

Breezin, breezin, she's no lover 
Nobody's lover, babe 
She says: Breezin, breezin 

Satisfaction unrequired baby 
A ghetto in your heart 
Hoards of mass production baby 
Is keeping us apart 

I know I wish you were black 
But ain't no use singing gospel 
She ain't ever coming back 
To put you on the right track 
She puts you on the right track
