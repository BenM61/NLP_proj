Excuse me sir I would like to leave the ride
Too many emergencies this time
I forgot, I forgot all this, all the trouble at my fingertips
Too many emergencies this time

Excuse me sir but what is in your bag
Feels like those evil things you had
I forgot, I forgot all this, all these things that they feed us with
Feels like those evil things inside

We caught the fire but the body escaped
Love other people but I don't know their names
I don't know their names

I'm in no fit state
I'm in no fit shape
To fall in love with you
To make a record of my life
To lose any more than I need
To watch my fingers bleed
To bust my body up
To drink out of your cup
To act a fool in love
Acting hard's been tough
To act a fool in love
Acting hard's been tough
