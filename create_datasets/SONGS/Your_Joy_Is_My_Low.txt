Said, your joy your joy is my low

He takes your face and positions it to take your mouth
You bite, you bite to excite yourself
He wants the colour of you to wear and feel alive
And you bite, and I'm awake and I'm the slave tonight

You lie, you lie to spare my life
You needed it, he tasted you inside out
Said, your joy, your joy is my low
So you want yourself to stop
So, your joy, your joy is my low
And when you crack the whip, I crawl again

You shift the play, push the curve to sit between your thighs
It's a sign, it's time to exercise the lines
You want the double cut through to wet, invade and slide
You slide and I'm awake and I'm the slave tonight

You lie, you lie to spare my life
You needed it, he tasted you inside out

Say it, your joy, your joy is my low
So you want yourself to stop
Said, your joy, your joy is my low
And when you crack the whip, I crawl again

Say it, your joy, your joy is my low
So you want yourself to stop
Said, your joy, your joy is my low
Your joy is my low

Want yourself to stop

Said, your joy, your joy is my low
So you want yourself to stop
Said, your joy, your joy is my low
And when you crack the whip, I crawl again

Say it, your joy, your joy is my low
So you want yourself to stop
Said, your joy, your joy is my low
Your joy is my low
