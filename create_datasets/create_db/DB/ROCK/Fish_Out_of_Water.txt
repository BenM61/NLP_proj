I'm done with yesterday, tomorrow I will drop today
I cannot operate on what I can and cannot say
I put my foot in it, tomorrow is another day
Some you win some you lose, the fish are out of water 

You're bringing me down
Loser 
You're bringing me down 
Loser
I too have swallowed it, the promise of a better day
And blind is one thing but now the picture is gray

A little negative, but negative is how we play
Some you win, some you lose
The fish are out of water 
You're bringing me down
Loser 

You're bringing me down 
I turn it on again and you're gone
I turn it on again and you're gone
I turn it on again and you're gone

I turn around again
I turn it on again and you're gone
I turn it on again and you're gone
I turn it on again and you're gone

Some you win, some you lose
The fish are out of water 
I guess I'm ready, I'm as ready as I'll ever be
It comes when it comes, it comes for everybody

Make no mistake about it, it will come for you
Some you win, some you lose
The fish are out of water 
You do what you do, let me do what I do

I'm gonna do it anyway, so why not do it too
And what if 'what if' turns out to be 'that's it for you'?
Some you win some you lose
The fish are out of water 

Me again, it's me again
Ain't I what the whole world wants to be?
Me again, it's me again
Last of the great pretenders my friend 

Me again, it's me again
Ain't I what the whole world wants to be?
Me again, it's me again
Last of the great pretenders my friend
