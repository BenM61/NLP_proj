Yeah yeah 
Oh yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah
Back in the day now

(chorus)
Back in the day when things were cool, hey
All we needed was bop-bop, bop-bop, bop-ba-domp
Ooooh, bop-bop, bop-bop, bop-ba-domp
Well well well
(repeat)

Soulflower take me flying with you, hey
Gimme dat bop-bop, bop-bop, bop-ba-domp
Gimme some of dat bop-bop, bop-bop, bop-ba-domp
Well well well

Back in the day when things were cool
We used to meet up with these dudes
Then we'd roll out on hopes and truths
And would ride around the park till its after dark
Pumpin the trunk with the windows rolled up, puff
Well well well

(chorus 2x)
Soulflower take me flying with you, hey
Just gimme dat bop-bop, bop-bop, bop-ba-domp
Gimme some of dat bop-bop, bop-bop, bop-ba-domp
Well well well

Wailin and singin and jammin and talkin
And pumpin the trunk with the windows rolled up, puff
Well well well
Da laughin and singin and jammin and talkin
Pumpin the trunk with the windows rolled up, puff
Well well well
Laughin and singin and jammin and talkin
And pumpin the trunk with the windows rolled up, puff
And we would ride around the park till its after dark
And when we get home hope the dogs don't bark, puff
Well well well
Laughin and singin and jammin and talkin
And pumpin the trunk with the windows rolled up, puff
Well well well
And we would ride around the park till its after dark
And when we get home hope the dogs don't bark, puff
Well well well
Laughin and singin and jammin and talkin
And pumpin the trunk with the windows rolled up, puff
Well well well
And we would ride around the park till its after dark 
And when we get home hope the dogs don't bark
(puff until fade-out)
