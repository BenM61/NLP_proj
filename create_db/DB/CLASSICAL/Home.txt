Love in a instant starts at a distance
Still shining bright
Space inbetween us, truth it will keep us
Close for all time

Our heart goes on and on
Our heart beating like a drum
In the dark you made me strong 
Like you've always done

I will carry you home
I will carry you home
You're in my heart and in my bones
I will carry you home

Lost in a moment, you keep me going
When I am blue
Now that it's over, still I am stronger 
As if I never knew you

Our heart goes on and on
Our heart beating like a drum
In the dark you made me strong
Like you've always done

I will carry you home
I will carry you home
You're in my heart and in my bones
I will carry you home
