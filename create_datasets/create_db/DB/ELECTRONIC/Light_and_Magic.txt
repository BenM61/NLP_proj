The kids are freed, now all they need is a gift from their mum and dad
They heard the tones of Spanish phones stranded in the sand

You left on the lights, is there somebody home
You left on the lights, is there somebody home
Left on the lights, is there somebody home
Light and magic

You cut your hair and made a friend, now they're falling into you
This is the closest that you will get to them, how do you do?

You left on the lights, is there somebody home
Switched off your voicemail and left it alone
Left on the lights, is there somebody home
Light and magic

Then lost some time in someone's line, might just've caught the show
This is not real, but it will deal with this thing between tonight and tomorrow

By the beach in a one-storey building, you're lucky if the light's not out
But, baby, now you look like a Xerox of yourself

The kids are free, now all they need is a gift from their mum and dad...
