When I was feeling it so hard
I couldn't see through my scars
You led the way through the dark
My eyes were opened with love

I'm seeing colours flowing through my mind
Colours, colours
And I want to walk in your water
And I want to walk in your water

When I was feeling it so hard
I couldn't see through my scars
Now I'm seeing colours flowing through my mind
Colours, colours

I'm seeing colours,
Colours, colours, colours, colours, colours, colours,
