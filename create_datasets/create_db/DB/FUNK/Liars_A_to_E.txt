Nobody tells you, you end up knowing (knowing)
Bad habits, you should sleep alone
Open to suggestions, is that the way you feel? 
(Is that the way, the way you feel?)
'Cause you're the voice of experience, every word
You choose sweet stolen info you must never lose
You're so secure in your habitat, familiar
(You feel it, you feel so secure)
But you won't want from me (you never want no, nothin', never, yeah)
There's nothin' else to see (and you should know somethin')
Try smokin' your own and don't look at me
(I'm lookin', I'm lookin', singin', singin' it singin' it)
No need to explain it, just order dresses
Bad habits, you really shouldn't keep (don't sleep there)
Quick nip next door to the, the vendor of charisma
(No need explainin', you live next door to the vendor of charisma)
Because the time, the place and the mood is right
And good old Kevin'll be all right (Kevin's gonna be alright)
Here comes his soul, get your pen and notebooks ready (ooh here comes his, ooh here comes his)
(Ooh here comes his, here comes his soul, get your pen and notebooks ready)
But you won't look like me (you never want no, nothin', never)
And you'll never think like me (and you should know something)
Try smokin' your own and don't follow me (and don't follow me)
(I'll follow, I'm singin', singin', singin' it, singin' it)

There's no next door, to a vulnerable replacement  

'Cause you're the voice of experience, every word (every word you choose)
You choose sweet stolen info you must never lose (and your heart, no)
So secure in your habitat, familiar
You won't want from me (you never want no, nothin', never, yeah)
And there's nothin' else to see (and you should know somethin')
Try smokin' your own and don't look at me 
(I'm lookin', I'm lookin', singin', singin' it singin' it)
No need to explain it, just order dresses
Bad habits, you should sleep alone
