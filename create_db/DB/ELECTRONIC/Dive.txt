Tell her something (Tell her something)
Tell her nothing (Tell her nothing)
Tell her that you waited

And I know you like it
So you try to hide it

I was looking (I was looking)
Out the window (Out the window)
All the people waited

Tell her something (Tell her something)
Tell her nothing (Tell her nothing)
Tell her that you faded

And I know you like it
So you try to hide it

And you know I like it
So I dive to find it

Empires lost in confusion
Golden hearts left of illusion
You said my big imagination
Shattered, flickered creation

And hide over the ocean
Waves crash in chemical motion

Left of illusion
Left of illusion
