I was never just an ordinary girl
Who underwent a transformation
I always thought I could see the stars
And watch them grow in my hands
But my mind was bigger than the world
My choice was being born a girl
When will I ever learn the truth
Without the fiction without the friction without the fiction
When it's the same as before
I conquer nothing or all
But my mind was bigger than the world
My choice was being born a girl
I like to watch
So nothing can hurt me
I understand
When your patience deserts you
I think I've loved
But I'm not so sure
Can someone tell me
What I'm here for
I was never just an ordinary girl
Who underwent a transformation
But my mind was bigger than the world
My choice was being born a girl
You deserted me
Left me on the street
To be what I would be
You never gave me your time
Made me feel dirty and unkind
To feel the way I do about you
Has numbed me to all that's beautiful
To feel the way I feel about you
Has made me wonder what I have to do
To feel the way I do about you
To feel the way I do about you
