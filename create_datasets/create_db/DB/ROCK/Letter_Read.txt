My love, my love, my love
How could you do this to me
My love, my love, my love
You were supposed to be
And I shouldn't have to tell you to explain yourself

My love, my love, my love
How could you do this to me
My love, my love, my love
You're not enough for me
And I shouldn't have to tell you to explain yourself

All I have is your letter read
And I cannot get it out of my head

And I'm afraid, and I can't breathe
And I'm in love with you
But you are not with me
And I have put so much into a life
I made too much about you now to lie

My love, my love, my love
How could you do this to me
My love, my love, my love
You're not enough for me
And I shouldn't have to tell you to explain yourself

But all I have is your letter read
And I cannot get it out of my head

All I have you letter read
And I cannot get it out of my head

And I'm afraid, and I can't breathe
And I'm in love with you
But you are not with me
And I have put so much into a life
I made too much about you now to lie

Time passes by
While I wait for your call
Time passes by
I hear nothing at all

And I'm afraid, and I can't breathe
And I'm in love with you
But you are not with me
And I have put so much into a life
I made too much about you now to lie

I'm afraid, and I can't breathe
And I'm in love with you
But you are not with me
And I have put so much into a life
I made too much about you now to lie

I'm afraid, and I can't breathe
And I'm in love with you
But you are not with me
