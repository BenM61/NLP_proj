Smoked the bong to the bang and got crunk
Shorty with the thong and the chain's about to get nutty
From my song my hands, I ain't tryna be ya buddy
Let a player cut somethin *scratching*

Now it's on anything that got drunk
Skully took it strong to the brain, and I'm
Talkin dirty to this broad, "where yo' mayne?"
Think about it, till early in the mo'nin, bout 7:30

Get it on with the Philly, light the blunt and hell it's on
If ya tryna hit me, then hit me on my cella-phone
Really homes, take a hunnie with the silicone
Tighter than an S-Type sittin right on plenty chrome

Strong in the game, but not to play with anyone
Yeaga like to dance, but not just to any song
Gotta be the one, that rep well clear from
"No perm, no fade, no brush, no comb"

Broke somethin, drank somethin, cut somethin, what (set it out)
Broke somethin, drank somethin, cut somethin, what (set it out)
Broke somethin, drank somethin, cut somethin, what (set it out)
Broke, drank, cut, what (set it out)

Made the next call for the drink, the drink; straight to the head
Stuck on the wall, thumbtack, but what I shoulda did
Focus on the sack and sip just a little bit
Blame it on the Jack D, get back to the chick

Look I'm a mack, I think ya ass fulla shit
It ain't the way ya talkin broad, who ya think ya foolin wit?
Any nigga off the street, he game, school the chick
A hoe is a hoe fa sho', and any shoe'll fit

Call it what you want, blunt lit in the club crunk
Drunk than a muh'fucker, split tryna cut somethin
Quick now us want somethin, and the broad lookin thick
Whattchu think he slicker than the liquor tryna move his dick?

Now hold up; what? Stop; huh?
Somebody roll the weed up, feet up
V.I.P. lookin all G'd up, hair stay P'd up
Can't talk long gotta cut somethin, see ya

Broke somethin, drink somethin, cut somethin, hold up, what?!
Broke somethin, drink somethin, cut somethin, hold up, what?!
Broke somethin, drink somethin, cut somethin, hold up, what?!
Broke somethin, drink somethin, cut somethin, hold up, what?!

Nappy Roots, get it up at a sold out show
Cut her to, give it up when ya tho' that dough
Don't be playin no games, what I told that hoe
Forget her name, but she gone lemme cut that's all I know

Now I'm horny as a - pitbull
Some alcohol 'case I mess around and cut somethin
Get fooled, at the bar smoke somethin
It's cool, hit the telly, two hens in the whirlpool

Steady sippin on courvoisier
Ghetto type at the bar spittin the gossip-eh
That's all - lookin like Beyonce
Bout to cut, stuff brown in my cup (yeaga what?)

Hurry up dawg, tryna holla at these broads
Tell 'em I'm a playa, watch 'em cream in her drawers
Say I'm Randy Moss then her panties came off
Quicker than a wide receiver runnin out on a cross
Shake it off now!
