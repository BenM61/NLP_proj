I need a break it's all the same 
Under the sweet December rain 
Just a crack of yellow light 
To shine on my head 
You'll find that I fought for the right 
To laugh with my eyes till tears would fall 
And the salt would hit my lips 
With some love to help me survive 
Don't you want it? 
I've never seen anyone who wants it this bad 

You said games were much more fun 
I'd rather play than get things done 
Well look where we are now 
Look where we are now 

So the pencils change to pens 
I just want to hang out with my friends 
We can give it our all 
Time after time but it just keeps getting harder 
And getting hotter to the touch 
I need the hot and simple sun 
I wanna just let go
With someone to help me survive 
Don't you want it? 
I've never seen anyone who wants it this bad 

You said games were much more fun 
I'd rather play than get things done 
Well look where we are now 
Look where we are now 

You said life happens too fast 
I'd rather play and make it last 
Well look where we are now 
Well look where we are now 

I guess if I change up this direction we could 
Start it all over, my dear, yeah 
If I could just move in this direction we could, yeah 

You said games were much more fun 
I'd rather play than get things done 
Well look where we are now 
Look where we are now 

You said life happens too fast 
I'd rather play and make it last 
Well look where we are now 
Well look where we are now 

You said it, you said it 
Games were much more fun 
Well look where we are now
