You better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm tellin' you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

He's makin' a list and checkin' it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

You better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm tellin' you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

With little tin horns and the little toy drums
Rudy-toot-toot and rummy tum tum
Santa Claus is comin' to town

And curly head dolls that cuddle and coo
Elephant, boat and the kiddy cars too
Santa Claus is comin'
Santa Claus is comin'
Santa Claus is comin' to town
