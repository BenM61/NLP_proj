Now as I look around
What do I see
Everybody wants to try to get to know me baby
Now it's my prerogative to do what I want to do
And I couldn't see myself babe with no one but you

I don't want nobody else but you
'Cause no one makes me feel
The way that you do
I don't want nobody else but you
'Cause no one makes me feel
The way that you do

Now I see you just can't handle
Handle my lifestyle
You say I'm do damn crazy
You say I'm to damn wild
You gotta understand
This is just the way I live
Baby what you see is exactly what you get (Nobody, but my my baby)

I don't want nobody else but you
'Cause no one makes me feel
The way that you do
I don't want nobody else but you
'Cause no one makes me feel
The way that you do

I don't want nobody else but you
'Cause no one makes me feel
The way that you do
I don't want nobody else but you
'Cause no one makes me feel
The way that you do

I know the situations shady
You have to understand
You know that I'm the man (baby)
I feel ya bout to drive me crazy
You're acting insecure
When all I want is you (you you baby)

Well uh you can take my word like in God We Trust
Baby girl they only want me cause I'm on the bus
I don't want a crew I just want you
Solo stereotypes I'm from Watts, so I'm ghetto
No more games or drama
If you live by the nana you die by the nana
Nobody knows how far we'll go
But I do I don't want nobody but you

I don't want nobody else but you
'Cause no one makes me feel
The way that you do
I don't want nobody else but you
'Cause no one makes me feel
The way that you do

I don't want nobody else but you
'Cause no one makes me feel
The way that you do
I don't want nobody else but you
'Cause no one makes me feel
The way that you do

I don't want nobody else but you
'Cause no one makes me feel
The way that you do
