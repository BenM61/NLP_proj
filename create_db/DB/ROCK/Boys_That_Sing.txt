She's a rhino
She's a whino
She's a tightrope
We'll be fine though, singing woah-oh
What do they know?
She's a Libra
And I need her
The Mona Lisa
Would want to be her, singing woah0oh
What do they know?

And she said that together we could take on the world
And she told me that I'll never find another girl like her

She's in Lycra
But I don't like her
She's a tiger
But not as violent, singing woah-oh
What do they know?
She's a weirdo
And a lido
She's a beer girl
And she's cheerful, singing woah-oh
What do they know?

And she said that together we could take on the world
And she told me that I'll never find another girl like her

And she said that together we could do anything
And she told me that she loves a boy who knows how to sing so I learned how to sing
