You might find yourself
Angry at the things I do
Things I put you through
Hope your able to forgive me
Like I forgive you I forgive you

Aah girl, what are you thinking
I'm thinking that we
Should stick together
I reckon that we
Should follow our hearts

Alright now let's stick together
Let's follow our hearts
Not even lions, can tear us apart.

I'm looking for answers, some kinda relief
Some kinda salvation, to make it all complete

Aah girl, what are you thinking
I'm thinking that we
Should stick together
I reckon that we
Should follow our hearts

Let's stick together
Let's follow our hearts
Not even lions, can tear us apart

Let's stick together
Let's follow our hearts
Not even lions, can tear us apart

Aah girl, what are you thinking.
