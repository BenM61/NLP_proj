Stay, I'm burning slow, with me in the rain
Walking in the soft rain, calling out my name
See me burning slow

Brilliant days
Wake up on brilliant days
Shadows of brilliant ways will change all the time
Memories
Burning gold memories
Gold of day memories change me in these times

Somewhere there is some place
That one million eyes can't see
And somewhere there is someone
Who can see what I can see?

Someone, somewhere in summertime
Someone, somewhere in summertime
Someone, somewhere in summertime
Someone, somewhere in summertime

Stay, I'm burning slow, with me in the rain
Walking in the soft rain, calling out my name
See me burning slow

Moments burn, slow burning golden nights
Once more see city lights, holding candles to the flame
Brilliant days, wake up on brilliant days
Shadows of brilliant ways will change me all the time

Somewhere there is some place
That one million eyes can't see
And somewhere there is someone
Who can see what I can see?

Someone, somewhere in summertime
Someone, somewhere in summertime
Someone, somewhere in summertime
Someone, somewhere in summertime
Someone, somewhere in summertime
Someone, somewhere in summertime
Someone, somewhere in summertime
Someone, somewhere in summertime
