It's raining in this room
And it's so hot outside this room

I don't know no one here
I don't want to be here
In this room

We hold parties in our sleep
We fill ourselves up in our sleep

And I'll heal you when you're ill
Though it's hard keeping still
In our sleep

Pries the hair out of her mouth
Whilst the circus is heading south

While we search in the sand
Don't ask them to understand
Why they cover up their hands
And their mouths
