I got a bad case of love
Bad case of love
Bad case of love
Bad case of love
I got a bad case of love
My heart is with misery

I live in loneliness, never get no rest
Went to see a love doctor to get out of this mess
Took a look at me before he cast his spell
Shook his head, then began to yell

You got a bad case of love
Bad case of love
Bad case of love
Your heart is filled with misery
