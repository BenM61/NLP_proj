I could kiss the she-fire
Just like a holy fool
I could never think too much
Just like that holy holy fool

I could see a bright bright future
In the bottom of this coffee cup
I could spring up and down, up
And down

Just like a jet boy out of school
Holy fool

Take me there
Breath the air

I could pick up the pieces
And try to play the rules
I could dig down deeper and
Deeper

Like a holy holy fool
I could think there's no
Judgment
No control, no control, no

I could think the best times ahead
Now
Like a holy fool
Holy fool

Take me there

Breath the air

Kiss the she-fire
