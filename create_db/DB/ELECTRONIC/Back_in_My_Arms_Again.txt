And the words of the song say everything
When I switch on the radio

Because it brings back all the memories
And it seems so long ago

Oh
But there's a rain outside on the window pane

Is it cold inside your heart?
If I don't get back to you somehow
I know it's gonna tear me apart

Once again
Let's give it another try

Because I need you back in my arms and then
Once again
The love in my heart won't die
Even if you say good-bye
Once again.

And I think I see you everywhere
And sometimes I call your name
And I feel the hurt inside of me

I wonder do you feel the same?
Oh
But if we tuni our backs on a broken heart
And look each other in the eye

If our love has the strength to take us t
We only have to keep it alive

Once again
Let's give it another try

Oh
But there's a rain outside on the window pane

Once again
Let's give it another try

I said I need you
Oh
I need your lovin'
Yeah

Oh
Back in your arms again
Once again
Let's give it another try
