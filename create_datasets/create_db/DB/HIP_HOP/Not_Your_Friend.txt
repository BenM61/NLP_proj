Your girlfriend wants to get with me
I can tell how she looks at me
And how she licks her tongue at me
Then ask for a ride home from me
She likes what I do to you
Tell you all the things that you never knew
Like the sky, her Ferrari's blue
Spending time in Honolulu 

1 - I told you once before about that girl
She's so mysterious, so watch that girl
And keep that girl away from me
Cause she's jocking me

2 - You're girl (wanting me)
I see her (watching me)
She's licking (her lips at me)
She's not your friend the girl
(So shady) I see her (watching me)
She's licking (her lips at me)
She's not your friend, that girl

You're friend wants to get wit me
She's hawking me down like you wouldn't believe 
Leaving her panties at my doorstep too 
Writing me letter dissin' you
She's a freak like I told you so
Said she wanna go toe to toe
With me and your other girl Coko
Just sit back babe watch her go

Repeat 1 

Repeat 2 (2x)

Repeat 1

Repeat 2 till end
