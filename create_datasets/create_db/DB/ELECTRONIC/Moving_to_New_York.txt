I've just had the craziest week
Like a party bag of lies, booze and then deceit
And I don't know why I want to voice this out loud
It's therapeutic somehow

So I'm moving to New York

'Cause I've got problems with my sleep
And we're not the same and I will wear that on my sleeve
So I'm moving to New York
'Cause I've got issues with my sleep
Looks like Christmas came early
Christmas came early for me

I put one foot forward and ended up 30 yards back
Am I loosing touch or am I just completely off the track
And I don't know why I want to voice this out loud
It's therapeutic somehow

So I'm moving to New York
'Cause I've got problems with my sleep
And we're not the same and I will wear that on my sleeve
So I'm moving to New York
'Cause I've got issues with my sleep
Looks like Christmas came early
Christmas came early for me
