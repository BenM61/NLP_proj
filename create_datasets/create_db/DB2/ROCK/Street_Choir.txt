Street choir sing me the song for the new day
Don't make it long and remember to sing it the old way
Let it all out, let your voice ring in the street now
My fun, shall be this one to complete now

Why did you leave America
Why did you let me down
And now that things seem better off
Why do you come around
You know I just can't see you now
In my, in my new world crystal ball
You know I just can't free you now
That's not my job at all

Move it on up, move it on up by the window
Magnificent flow, oh let it all go in the moon glow
I'll take the wine, I'll take the wine with the gravy
Ask you the time, and just send the bill to my baby

Why did you leave America
Why did you let me down
And now that things seem better off
Why do you come around
You know I just can't see you now
In my, in my, in my new world crystal ball
You know I just can't free you now
That's not my job at all

Why did you leave America
Why did you let me down
And now that things seem better off
Why do you come around
You know I just can't see you now
In my, in my, in my new world crystal ball
You know, you know, you know I just can't free you now
That's not my job at all
You know, you know, you know I just can't free you now
That's not my job at all
