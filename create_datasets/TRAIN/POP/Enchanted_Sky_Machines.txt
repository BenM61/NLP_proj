If I told you some secrets
Would you say I'm unreal?
I could easily love you
If you'd just let me feel
I can't play forever
The games I've outgrown
But just till enchanted sky machines
take all the gentle home
Just needin' to touch you
is so hard to restrain
Just waitin' for the time
Could maybe make me insane
My heart is so hungry
Livin' on patience alone
Please hurry enchanted sky machines
Take all the gentle home
I believe the beginning
Won't be too far away
The power's gittin' stronger
I see signs every day
So I'll swallow my yearnin
And I won't let it be shown
Until the enchanted sky machines
Take all the gentle home
My desire is a rosebud
in the magic design
I can't wait to feel it bloom
They'll be landin' anytime
Then when the skeptics are wondern'
Where all the faithful have flown
We'll be on enchanted sky machines
The gentle are going home
