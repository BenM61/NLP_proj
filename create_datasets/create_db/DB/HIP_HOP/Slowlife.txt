I big up the same place since back in stone age
This is my main stage I owe the whole space
Take it for free babes don't wait in vain chase
The slow center of the storm where everything lasts on

I ride on my wave no matter where I got it's there
I fly my light safe, I am declared I am aware that I am fool and brave
I build my thrones, I break my bones
I am my kingdoms rave, I never rest things move on fast

Going for a slowlife, almost understand
Time has got no end, let the soul drive
Going for a slowlife, almost understand
Time has got no end, let the soul drive

Slowly freakin' out, hear me now speakin' out
Won't be speakin' loud
How do you feel about listening to crazy men?
Whose minds, sneakin' out
A hazy sense of evidence for what life is all about

It's real love and everything, a family, no scattering
Daddy swing the children like Hollywood happy end
Just like so many men, I look for almost everything
Meanwhile whistling, here we go sing again

No matter how close to perfect it is
It's taken me too far, I'm afraid, I'm obsessed with it, vex with it
Good's not enough, be the best in it
In order to the best, I can never stop flexin' it

You flex it to the max and it feels like sex with it
It's made you to the boss and you feel you're blessed with it
Now everybody wants it, you start protecting it
This is when you wish you had no more stress with it, so

Going for a slowlife, almost understand
Time has got no end, let the soul drive
Going for a slowlife, almost understand
Time has got no end, let the soul drive

Going for a slowlife, almost understand
Time has got no end, let the soul drive
Going for a slowlife, almost understand
Time has got no end, let the soul drive

Going for a slowlife
Slowlife
Going for a slowlife
Let the soul drive
