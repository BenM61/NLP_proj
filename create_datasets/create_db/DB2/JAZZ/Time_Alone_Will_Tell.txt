Time alone will tell 
If our romance is real
Or just a springtime spell
For heaven knows and time will tell

Though I know so well
What we believe is love
May just turn out to be
A memory, but time will tell

Do we really care
Or do we share a fool's imagination?
Nights will hurry by
Then you will know, and so will I

When Spring has had its fling
If you are in my arms
We'll know it's not a spell
We'll know it's real, but time will tell

When Spring has had its fling
If you are in my arms
We'll know it's not a spell
We'll know it's real, but time, time alone will tell
