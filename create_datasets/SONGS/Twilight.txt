When darkness falls
On Summer's end
So in your absence
I shall begin
When Darkness falls the race is done
And Love lives not
When Hope is gone
Goodbye, sufer

Everything's gonna be alright

The longest night of every year
I spent beside you, baby
Do you remember anything about me?
I was the one when Hope was gone
Who took too long to sing this song

Everything's gonna be alright

When darkness falls
On Summer's end
So in your absence
I shall begin
When Darkness falls
The race is through

Everything's gonna be alright
