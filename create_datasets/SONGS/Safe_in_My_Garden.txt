Safe in my garden
An ancient flower blooms
And the scent from its nature
Slowly squares my room
And its perfume being such
That it's causing me to swoon

Could it be we were hot wired
Late one night, we're very tired
They stole our minds
And thought we'd never know it
With a bottle in each hand
Too late to try to understand
We don't care where it lands, we just throw it

Somebody take us away
Somebody take us away

Safe in my garden
An ancient flower blooms
And the scent from its nature
Slowly squares my room
And it's perfume being such
That it's causing me to swoon

When you go out in the street
So many hassles with the heat
No one there can fill your desire
Cops out with the megaphones
Telling people stay inside their home
Man, can't they see the world's on fire

Somebody take us away, take us away

Safe in our garden
An ancient flower blooms
And the scent from its nature
Slowly squares my room

Take us away, take us away
