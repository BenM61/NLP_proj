Holy smoke
A land sakes alive
I never thought this could happen to me

Mm, yeah
Mm, yeah

I got stung by a sweet honey bee
Oh, what a feeling come over me
It started in my eyes
Crept up to my head
Flew to my heart
Till I was stung dead
I'm done, uh-uh
I got stung!

Mm, yeah
Mm, yeah

She had all that I wanted and more
And I've seen honey bees before
She started buzzin' in my ear
Buzzin' in my brain
Got stung all over
But I feel no pain
I'm done, uh-uh
I got stung!

Now, don't think I'm complainin'
I'm might be pleased we met
'Cause you give me 
One little peck on the back of my neck
And I break out in a cold cold sweat
But if I live to a hundred and two
I won't let nobody sting me but you
I'll be buzzin' 'round your hive, ev'ry day at five
And I'm never gonna leave once I arrive
'Cause I'm done
Uh-uh, I got stung!

Mm, yeah
Mm, yeah

And I don't think I'm complainin'
I'm might be pleased we met
'Cause you give me 
One little peck on the back of my neck
And I break out in a cold cold sweat
But if I live to a hundred and two
I won't let nobody sting me but you
I'll be buzzin' 'round your hive, ev'ry day at five
And I'm never gonna leave once I arrive
'Cause I'm done
Uh-uh, I got stung!

Mm, yeah
Mm, yeah
Mm, yeah
Mm, yeah
