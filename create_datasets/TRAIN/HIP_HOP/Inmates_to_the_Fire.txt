Tonight is the night you will lose the fight
I think you'd better think twice
Before you touch that mic
You could lose your life
When you f*ck with the right
Tryin to bite
You get blasted with the pipe

(Prodigal Sunn)
These words and lyrics from the round table
The Sunz of Man generate light
The third knight form the Concentration Camp
Burnin like the gas lamp
I came equipped with the gold as my wardrobe
Fully-armored, seven soldiers from the look-out
Jeffrey Domer, speakin a ministry
My terminology, f*ck the industry
Cause on the top is where I'm soon to be
The holy scam connect with the Royal Fam
With Rza, we ignite the jam
F*ck you and your Uncle Sam
Never gave a damn for the fakin and phony ?
Scannin, my understandin, snatchin ? like a cannon
You ask the question, why
Tell me, can you testify
Justify asgainst the high nigga
I maybe do or die
My mindstate, magnifies all lies
And for the spy, I keep em searchin for the alibi

(Hell Razah)
We goin gold D, The one and only, sharper than Shinobi
N-why-O-be	, kid you knows me
Hittin on my hoes is for old D's
You know me, gotta roll trees
Rolly goaly, behold we
Scorin mass points off your goalie
You try cop blocks, stoppin slowly
Ain't no way to control me
When I'm comin for that trophy
Or buildin my dynasty like that character in ?
The unholy, the government before tryed to sold me
And your life, pass the trees, gone fly the laws, Frank Senatras
Singin about street opers, dead gun to be, want to be
Al Pachino and Danny Devito
Dressed in tuxedos, gamblin the lives of gambinos
Blood suck the poor like mosquitos

(60 Second Assassin)
Streets of fire, two on one man riot
Hired 60 Second 'ssassin, rap retirin thugs
Who was bug, when they new they should of dug
Feenin to be a king, knowin mine, I'm a royal flush
Shit'll drain down today, you couldn't maintain megaplanes
Shit'll totally freeze you ass insane
I be the headman, professin, consider it a blessin
You next dead, only peace that you're restin
Or should I say rest in peace
Dead respectivly, knocked off your piece
Without a store, we stole beef
Another example, ?shitty diaper in my handle?
My Arm and Hammer, I'm doin stains at random
Think it's best if you clean, 6o Second see it
Quotin in five minutes, I'll be five g's richer
You need to put your money up, you're only one up
Fuckin with Sunz of Man, you're gonna get bankrupt

(various talk to fade)
