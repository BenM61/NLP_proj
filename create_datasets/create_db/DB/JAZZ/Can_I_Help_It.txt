You left one yesterday 
You took my heart away 
And now I dread each newborn day 

Can I help it? 
Can I help it? 
Along each thoroughfare 
While people stop and stare 

I talk to you but you're not there 
Can I help it, sweetheart? 
I try to sleep 
My dreams are haunted 

By a million stars that pry 
How can I sleep? 
Your eyes look just that way 
The day we said goodbye... 

I tried forgetting you 
I tried to hurt you too 
But now I find I still love you 
Can I help it, sweetheart?
