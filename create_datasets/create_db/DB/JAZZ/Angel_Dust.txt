He was groovin'
And that was when he coulda sworn
The room was movin'
But that was only in his mind
He was sailin'
He never really seemed to notice
Vision failin'
'cause that was all part of the high
Sweat was pourin'
He couldn't take it
The room was exploding
He might not make it.

Angel DustPlease, children would you listen.
Angel DustJust ain't where it's at.
Angel DustYou won't remember what you're
Missin', but down some dead end streets
There ain't no turnin' back.

They were standin'
Ev'rybody in a circle,
The whole family
Listening to the preacher's words
Sis was cryin'
She alone held all the secrets
'bout his dyin'
Tears fallin' to earth
Maybe her fault
He was so trusting
God only knew why
They was dustin'!
