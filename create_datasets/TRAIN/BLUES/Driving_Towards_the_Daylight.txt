Look upon a mountain
Waitin' on a train
Baby I know what's wrong
And it still happened again
Waiting on my destiny
Learning from my abilities
Who was wrong and
Who was right and
Do we even know why we are fighting?
So take your eyes off of me
And look upon the churning sea

Driving towards the daylight
Running from the midnight
Trying to get my way home
Running from the spotlight
Trying to find the daylight
Trying to get back home

Rusty strings on my old guitar
Speaks volumes of who you are
So never did I think it was you
It was me, one of the chosen few
Who will it be, oh the next time?
Hopefully one with more sense of mind
So where did you go?
Always will see
It's a story of you and me

Driving towards the daylight
Running from the midnight
Trying to get my way home
Running from the spotlight
Trying to find the daylight
Trying to get back home

Driving towards the daylight
Running from the midnight
Trying to get my way home
Running from the spotlight
Trying to find the daylight
Trying to get my way home

Driving towards the daylight
Running from that midnight
Trying to get my way home
Running from the spotlight
Trying to find the daylight
Trying to get my way home
