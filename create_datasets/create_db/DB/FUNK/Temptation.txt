Temptation drags you down
Take you were you want to be
But deep inside you know
The reason for the fear

The fear of letting go
The fear of being so
Possessed
All the time

Being hypnotised
By those evil evil eyes
Lead me not into

Temptation
Temptation
Temptation

Paralyse the thoughts
Beat them to the ground
Offer up a sacrifice
Don't feed the fear

The fear of letting go
The fear of being so
Possessed
All the time

Being hypnotised
By those evil evil eyes
Lead me not into

Temptation
Temptation
Temptation

Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
It offers everything
That you could possibly need

Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide

It all looks so inviting
Till it drags you to you knees

Temptation
