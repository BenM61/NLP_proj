Won't you tell me why?
You found another guy
Tell me why
You found another guy

In the beginning, things were just fine
I was so romantic; I thought that you were mine
I saw so happy, now I'm depressed
I'm so tired of this loneliness

You packed your bags, then you went away
I haven't seen you since that cold, cold day!
I gotta have you back no matter what it takes
So tell me why you found another guy

Tell me why
You found another guy
Tell me why
You didn't want me

I've been walkin around; things ain't the same
Since you been gone, I'm feelin' this pain
In my heart, it's so strong, so please come home
I've been waiting for you all night long

You packed your bags, then you went away
I haven't seen you since that cold, cold day!
I gotta have you back no matter what it takes
So tell me why you found another guy

Tell me why
You found another guy
Tell me why
You didn't want me no more

You didn't want me no more
I gotta have you back no matter what it takes
So tell me why you found another guy

Tell me why
You found another guy
Tell me why
You didn't want me no more

Tell me why
You found another guy
Tell me why
You didn't want me no more

Tell me why
You found another guy
