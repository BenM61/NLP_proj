Show some emotion
Put expression in your eyes
Light up
If you're feeling happy
But if it's bad
Then let those ears roll down

Some people hurting
Someone choking up inside
Some poor souls dying
Too proud to say
They got no place to lie
And there's people
If they hear a joke
Can't keep the laugh
Out of their eye

I said
Show some emotion
Put expression in your eyes
Light up
If you're feeling happy
But if it's bad
Then let those tears roll down

Some people in love
But all they got's a photography
How can they get it
Too scared
To open their mouth
To ask

I said
Show some emotion
Put expression in your eyes
Light up
If you're feeling happy
But if it's bad
Then let those tears roll down

Come on try
Learn to bleed
When you get a bad fall
Light up
Light up
Light up
If it's nice
But if it's bad
Then let those tears roll down
