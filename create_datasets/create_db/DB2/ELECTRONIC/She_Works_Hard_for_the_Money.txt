She works hard for the money 
So hard for it, honey 
She works hard for the money 
So you better treat her right 

She works hard for the money 
So hard for it, honey 
She works hard for the money 
So you better treat her right 

I met her there in the corner stand 
And she wonders where she is and 
It's strange to her 
Some people seem to have everything 

Nine a.m. on the hour hand 
And she's waiting for the bell 
And she's looking real pretty 
Just waiting for her clientele 

She works hard for the money 
So hard for it, honey 
She works hard for the money 
So you better treat her right 

She works hard for the money 
So hard for it, honey 
She works hard for the money 
So you better treat her right 

Twenty-eight years have come and gone 
And she's seen a lot of tears 
Of the ones who come in 
They really seem to need her there 

It's a sacrifice working day to day 
For little money, just tips for pay 
But it's worth it all 
To hear them say that they care 

She works hard for the money 
So hard for it, honey 
She works hard for the money 
So you better treat her right 

Already knows 
She's seen her bad times 
Already knows 
These are the good times 

She'll never sell out 
She never will 
Not for a dollar bill 
She works hard 

She works hard for the money 
So hard for it, honey 
She works hard for the money 
So you better treat her right 

Hard for the money 
So hard for it, honey 
She works hard for the money 
So you better treat her right
(Alright)

She works hard for the money
(Hard, hard, hard for the money)
So hard for it, honey
(Hard, hard, hard for it, honey)
She works hard for the money 
So you better treat her right

She works hard for the money
(Hard, hard, hard for the money)
So hard for it, honey
(Hard, hard, hard for it, honey)
