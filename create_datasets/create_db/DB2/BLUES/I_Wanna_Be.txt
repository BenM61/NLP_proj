I wander helplessly day by day.
It's so much easier to run away.
My mind is spent, my body sold,
Never knowing which way to go

I'm always there for you baby,
Won't you let me see
If we can get closer.
Every day,

I want to be felt by you.
I want to be touched by you.
I want to be loved by you.
I want to be anything you want me to.

Don't mean nothing when you're growing old.
Nobody knows what the future holds.
I am left with a bitter taste,
Torn away from that beautiful chase.

I'm always there for you baby,
Won't you let me see
If we can get closer.
Every day,

I want to be felt by you.
I want to be touched by you.
I want to be loved by you.
I want to be anything you want me to.

I want to be felt by you.
I want to be touched by you.
I want to be loved by you.
I want to be anything you want me to.
