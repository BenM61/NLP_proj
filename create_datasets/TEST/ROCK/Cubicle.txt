You got them bruises placed upon your legs
You got them scratch marks around upon the hedge
I know your story
It won't be up straight
'Cause when I'm not there
I know you can't wait

This ain't the first time
I caught you out again
You spend your time
We spent all Saturday night
In a cubicle

You got that lipstick smeared around your face
You got them skinny boys stayin' at your place
I know your story
It won't be up straight
'Cause when I'm not there
I know you can't wait

You get your get your get your love

This ain't the first time
I caught you out again
You spend your time
In a little cubicle
In a cubicle

I got that lipstick smeared around my face
I got them skinny girls playin' round my place
I'll give you stories
They won't be up straight
'Cause when you're not there
You know I can't wait

Yeah Yeah Yeah

This ain't the first time
I caught you out again
You spend your time
In a little cubicle
In a cubicle

All my time in a cubicle
All your time
All your time
All your time
All your time
