Hey what you'd say your name was
Rubber back
You got a brain you ain't using
You got charm you're abusin'

Too busy out there floosin'
Or lying at home snoozin'
Why you want to waste away lover of the life of leisure
Lover of the life of leisure

Why you want to waste away
Lover of the life of leisure
Lover of the life of leisure
Time moves along

You don't have a life anymore
Time moves along
You don't have a job
I got four

Spend my money on cigarettes
Midnight dragon and off track bets
Get up at three
Turn on the TV

For all I know you got a dangerous disease
So I gotta move along
I gotta move along
Why you want to waste away lover of the life of leisure

Lover of the life of leisure
Why you want to waste away lover of the life of leisure
Lover of the life of leisure
Nature has it

You got no cajones
A dog in heat
A one trick pony
Lover of the life of leisure

I love to love you but I might leave you
I'm a lover of the life of leisure if you don't like it you can leave it
Time on your hands
Rubber on your back

Rubber in your hand
Too much time on your back
Why you want to waste away lover of the life of leisure
Lover of the life of leisure 

Why you want to waste away
Lover of the life of leisure
Lover of the life of leisure
Tell me why a woman who loves a man

Who never gives her all he can he sleeps all day and scams all night
Thinkin' his service makes it alright
Ladies wanting the service 
Me always give them the service 

Ladies wanting the service
Me always give them the service
Why you want to waste away lover of the life of leisure
