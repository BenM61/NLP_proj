How many times have I felt down inside 
The need to be loved by you 
I wanted to show you how good it could be 
If you would only show a little interest in me 
Bat you run, you just won't show love 
That's the thing you're frightened of 

He's a runner 

You came into my life and tuned my head around 
And just as quickly you put me down 
Now you don't won't to know what I'm going through 
Cause just like I said, it means nothing to you 
So you run, you just won't show love 
That's the thing you're frightened of 

He's a runner 

He's a runner, he's a runner 

I've got this need eating away at my soul 
An insurmountable need that I just can't control 
You created this fire, when the flame got too hot 
You turned and walked away, just leaving me on the spot 
Yes you run, you just won't show love 
That's the thing you're frightened of 

There's little hope but the fool that I am 
Still holding on to this dream of a man 
The taste of his skin, the gentle touch of his hand 
Is worth waiting for, so I must understand 
Yes you run, you just won't show love 
That's the thing you're frightened of 

He's a runner, he's a runner 

Running away, running away, running away 
He's a runner, just running away 

He's a runner, he's a runner 
He's a runner, he's a runner
