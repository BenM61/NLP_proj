Words are my big obsession
I got to rave rave rave
Accept my indiscretion
Craving for words
Walking in procession
I got to rave rave rave
A little blabber session
Bound to misbehave

When you're yelling, 
Then I am spelling
You call the battle on
I call it rattle on
When you say your f-words, well, just like a songbird
Then it sounds to me just like poetry

Words are my big obsession
I got to rave rave rave
Accept my indiscretion
Bound to misbehave

When you say you like me
You really like my pony
But when I say I like you
I really mean I like you
Every time I call you
I know that I am stalking
But every time I see you
It really feels like talking

Prattle twaddle gabble babble
All the splendor from your lips
Say potato or potato
Then we jabber 'til I say chips
Nine-teen-ninty-post-whatever
Copy copy paste forever
Today is tomorrow's good old times
You say dada
I say it rhymes

Words are my big obsession
I got to rave rave rave
Accept my indiscretion
Craving for words
Walking in procession
I got to rave rave rave
A little blabber session
Bound to misbehave

When you say "oh no!"
Cooler than yoko
You call the battle on
I call it rattle on
When you say your f-words, just like a songbird
Then it sound to me just like poetry

Words are my big obsession
I got to rave rave rave
Accept my indiscretion
Bound to misbehave

You say "aah"
And I say "ah!"
You say "ooh"
And I say "oh!"
You say "uuh"
And I say "ugh!"
You say "eeee"
And I say blelebleleblele a a! u u! a a a a! 
U u u u! a a a a a a! u u u u u u! a a a a! u u u u! 

Pheromones pheromones! 
Chaperones chaperones! 
You say "clone"
I say "clown"
You say "bunny"
I say "brown"
You say "city"
I say "town"
You say "swim"
I say "drown"

Words are my big obsession
I got to rave rave rave
Accept my indiscretion
Bound to misbehave

Words are my big obsession
I got to
Rave
Rave
Rave
Accept my indiscretion
Bound to misbe-
Bound to misbe-
Bound to misbe-
-have
