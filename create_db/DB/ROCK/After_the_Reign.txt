Redman stands alone with his pride
Freeman knows no bounds
Tired of runnin', he's not gonna hide
Now he stands his ground

To take a man's home, there's no pity
One man's land for another man's city

[Chorus]
Take it back, to the place that I love
Take it back, to the big sky's above
Take it back, on the wings of a dove
After the reign

I can tell from the look on his face
There's no justice for all
They come with their plan, and they deal another hand
Still they take it all

When it comes to your own, you're blinded by shame
To take his land, is the name of the game

[Chorus]

After the reign, now who's to blame
Dreams have been washed away

[Chorus]

After the reign, all though the years
After the reign, gone are the fears
After the reign, there's no more tears
After the reign
