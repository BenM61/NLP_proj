Well you could be friends of mine
I see you're pondering but the pleasure will be mine
I do feel hungry even though I've had my share
I'll keep shouting out loud to convert the herd
Got to spread the word
To the non-believers, yeah

And the drummer must try holding time together
'Cause the rest of us can't keep it tight forever

Feels like I've been
To every single disco all around
Another night, another town
It's time to burn this disco down
A higher place, on higher ground
I've heard the sounds, how do you like it now?
Another night, another town
It's time to burn this disco down

Well you could be magnetised
I know you're wondering but for you I will oblige
If you try harder to persist in what you feel
Then you could push me down, am I making me heard
Got to spread the word to the disagreers, yeah

And the plastic must keep spinning around forever, round, round
And the memories will flood and keep us together

Feels like I've been 
To every single disco all around
Another night, another town
It's time to burn this disco down
