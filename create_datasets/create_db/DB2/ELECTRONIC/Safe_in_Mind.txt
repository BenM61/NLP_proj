Don't you go to turn around
Under the moon & stars
Can you find where hides the love?
Breathing down your neck

someone's found a way
Someone's found a way
Someone's found a way
Someone's found a way
Someone's found a way
Someone's found a way
Someone's found a way
Someone's found a way

I see the moon, the moon sees
All I do is twist in the breeze

someone's found a way
To break into my mind
Someone's found a way
To break into my mind
Someone's found a way
To break into my mind
Someone's found a way
To break into my mind

(someone's found a way)
To break into my mind.

Ah
Ah

Lives a gun that's always pointing
Lives a gun that's pointing in my face

(someone's found a way)
(someone's found a way)
(someone's found a way)
(someone's found a way)

Ah
(someone's found a way)
(someone's found a way)
(someone's found a way)
Ahh
(someone's found a way)
(someone's found a way)
(someone's found a way)

Ah
Someone's found a way
Someone's found a way
Ah
Someone's found a way
Someone's found a way
(to break into my mind)
(to break into my mind)

I like
The street, the smells
The sense of the underworld
Sometimes you come face to face with yourself
