Oh, it seems a long time ago
Oh, we didn't know
Before we had seen anything
We believed in everything
All those times you warmed my hand
Maybe things weren't easy as they seem

We backed each other to the hilt
We backed each other to the hilt
Now I live in this house we built

Hated you for leavin' me
You were my muse for so long
Now I'm drained creatively
I miss you on my team
Hated you for walkin' out
I blew up and you were gone
So they say it's the industry
But I miss you on my team

People say we're better off, you couldn't keep up
I still keep one broken piece
The one that fits in that chip on your shoulder
When we made our master plans
Is this where you thought we would be standing?

We backed each other to the hilt
We backed each other to the hilt
Now I live in this house we built

Hated you for leavin' me
You were my muse for so long
Now I'm drained creatively
I miss you on my team
Hated you for walkin' out
I blew up and you were gone
They say it's just the industry
But I miss you on my team

We started this together now you're gone
And when we said forever we were naive
You saw me as a superstar
And I was a case you helped them to see

Hated you for leavin' me
You were my muse for so long
Now I'm drained creatively
But I miss you on my team
