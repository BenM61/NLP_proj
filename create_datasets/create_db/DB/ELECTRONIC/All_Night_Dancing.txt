When you get the feelin' deep inside your bone
Dancin' is the thing to do
Step into the lights, it'll take you to new heights
Dancin' is the thing that you do

Fantasize that you're the greatest
Close your eyes an' make believe
You know you can do the latest dance
So dance with me, won't you do it with me

All night dancin'
I think about it all day long
All night dancin'
Think about it all day long

You're lookin' kinda hot, so jump into the spot
Shinin' bright somewhere above
Waitin' all day long just to hear your favorite song
Then dancin' to that beat that you love

Movin' like no other dancer
Sparks are flyin' off the floor
You can dance yourself, but I can only
Dance just a little bit more

All night dancin'
I think about it all day long
All night dancin'
Think about it all day long

When you get the feelin' deep inside your bone
Dancin' is the thing to do
You step into the lights, it'll take you to new heights
Dancin' is the thing that you do

Fantasize that you're the greatest
Close your eyes and make believe
You know you can do the latest dance
So dance with me, won't you do it with me
