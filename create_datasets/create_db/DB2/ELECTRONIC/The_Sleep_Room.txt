This is a story
And this is a song
Every little thing that they
Tell you is wrong
This isn't evil
This is a sound
And this conversation is possibly down.

I know that I'm not all that pretty
I know that I don't sound like I should
I don't even belong to fashion.

This is a secret
And all this is true
Everything I tell you belongs here with you
I'm not a hero
I'm no good
I don't belong here but my heroes should

And I'm moving
And I'm lying down
And I'm losing
And I'm losing.

This is uncertain
This is unsound
Is this a feeling or something I've found?
This is a story
This is a song
Every little thing that I've told you is wrong.
