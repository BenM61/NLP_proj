Get up, get up, get out of your lazy bed
Before I count to three, step to it baby.

She goes out every night till the morning is light
And she sleeps all day,
So come on, get up, I won't say it again,
I'll drag you out.

I don't care any more, you can sleep on the floor,
'Cause I'm locking you out,
So come on, get up, I won't say it again,
I'll drag you out.

Get up, get up, get out of your lazy bed.
