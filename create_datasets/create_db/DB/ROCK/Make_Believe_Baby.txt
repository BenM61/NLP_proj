I stole the starlight from the skies
And used it for my baby's eyes
I caught a sunbeam in the air
And made some shiny golden hair

Hey, make me a make believe baby
A loving make believe baby
Because I had no baby that I could call my own
Hey!

I heard a song and I rejoiced
Because it made the sweetest voice
I took a rose as red as wine
For tender lips to cling to mine

Hey, make me a make believe baby
A dreamy make believe baby
Because I had no baby and I was all alone
Yeah!

I said a prayer that I would find
A lover that was in my mind
I knew my prayer was coming true
The moment that I looked at you
Yeah

I don't need a make believe baby
Don't have to make believe baby
Because I found you, baby
To love and love me, too
