She worked in a laundry pressin' shirts and pants
Eight hours a day at that iron she'd stand
'bout every thirty minutes somebody said
Man, it's hot in here
She tied up her hair but she wouldn't cut it off
'cause Robbie lee likes it better when it's lone
And at night they'd meet at the cold spot
And drink some beer
And every mornin' when she'd clock in she'd say

One of these days, I'm getting out of here
Yeah one of these days, 'cause I'm too good for this place
Now I don't mean that like it sounds
But I'm not gonna be held down
Things are gonna change
One of these days

One Friday she said, that's it, I'm quittin'
We all thought that she was just kidding'
When we came back from lunch she didn't
And that was it
Somebody said they'd seen her downtown
Bags all packed steppin' on a greyhound
Robbie lee watchin' his world come down around him
I can't count the times I heard her say

One of these days, I'm getting out of here
Yeah one of these days, 'cause I'm too good for this place
Now I don't mean that like it sounds
But I'm not gonna be held down
Things are gonna change
One of these days

That girl wasn't nobody's fool
Bet she's workin' somewhere cool
And I'm startin' to think

One of these days, I'm getting out of here
Yeah one of these days, 'cause I'm too good for this place
Now I don't mean that like it sounds
But I'm not gonna be held down
Things are gonna change
One of these days

Yeah one of these days
Yeah, one of these days
