(Radio)

I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage life
And ev'rything I need to know
I heard it on my radio

You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds - invaded by Mars
You made us laugh - you made us cry
You made us feel like we could fly

So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know and just don't care
And just complain when you're not there
You have the time you have the power
You've yet to have your finest hour

All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio what's new?
Radio someone still loves you

We watch the stars - we watch the sun
On videos for thousand dollars
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years

Let's hope we'll never leave old friend
Like all good things on you we depend
So stick around 'cause we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual
You have the time you have the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
