There's a quiet revolution going on,
Like a fire in every corner of the world,
And friends that you have known for many years,
Are talking with a new light inside,
Talking with a brightness in their eyes;

There are quiet conversations going on,
As people speak about what they have seen,
And everywhere the feeling's getting stronger,
That soon there will be change in our lives,
From a thousand years of looking in the sky,
Something is coming now, something is coming now;

You will believe it when, you will believe it,
When the light comes shining through,
You will believe it when, you will believe it,
When it's shining down on you;

There are quiet celebrations going on,
So many have been waiting for so long,
To see the whole world waking from a dream,
And find a new dimension inside,
See a revelation in our time,
Something is coming now, something is coming now;

You will believe it when, you will believe it,
When the light comes shining through,
You will believe it when, you will believe it,
When it's shining down on you;

We must guard against the enemy,
They can help us or they can betray us in the night,
Don't talk, don't talk, but this quiet revolution,
Can destroy the men of darkness with the light;

You will believe it when, you will believe it,
When the light comes shining through,
You will believe it when, you will believe it,
When it's shining down on you;

You will believe it when, you will believe it,
When the light comes shining through,
You will believe it when, you will believe it,
When it's shining down on you,
When it's shining down on you, on you.
