You grabbed my hand and twisted it, so you had your way
No need to compromise 'cause you'll find the right words to say,
and I'll give it half a chance 

Alone together, all alone, together all alone

Alone no more, it's Wednesday night
Someone is gonna treat me right
No, not my man gets me this high
It's gonna be my neighbor at number 29 

I think I'll pack my bags and I'll leave it all behind
I'm gonna leave it all behind
No need to compromise 'cause these are the right words to say
Give it half a chance 

Alone together, all alone, together all alone 

Alone no more, it's Wednesday night
Someone is gonna treat me right
No, not my man gets me this high
It's gonna be my neighbor at number 29 

Alone no more, it's Wednesday night
Someone is gonna treat me right
No, not my man gets me this high
It's gonna be my neighbor at number 29 

You know, I was talking to my neighbor at number 29
No, not my man, It's not my man who gets me high
You know it's funny,
Alone no more
