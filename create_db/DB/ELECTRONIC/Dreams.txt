Now here you go again, you say you want your freedom 
Well who am I to keep you down 
It's only right that you should play the way you feel it 
But listen carefully to the sound 

[Bridge] 
Of your loneliness 
Like a heartbeat drives you mad 
In the stillness of remembering what you had 
And what you lost 
And what you had 
And what you lost 

[Refrain] 
Thunder only happens when it's raining 
Players only love you when they're playing 
yeh, women they will come and they will go 
When the rain washes you clean you'll know, you'll know 

Now here I go again, I see the crystal visions 
I keep my visions to myself 
It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams and 
Have you any dreams you'd like to sell 

Dreams of loneliness... 
[Bridge] 

[Refrain thrice] 

You'll know, whoa-o-oa, you'll know
