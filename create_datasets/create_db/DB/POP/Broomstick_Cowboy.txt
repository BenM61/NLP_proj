Dream on, little broomstick cowboy,
Of rocket ships and Mars
Of sunny days,
And Willie Mays,
And chocolate candy bars

Dream on, little broomstick cowboy,
Dream while you can
Of big green frogs,
And puppy dogs,
And castles in the sand

For, all too soon you'll awaken
Your toys will all be gone
Your broomstick horse will ride away,
To find another home
And you'll have grown into a man,
With cowboys of your own
And then you'll have to go to war,
To try and save your home
And then you'll have to learn to hate
You'll have to learn to kill
It's always been that way, my son
I guess it always will

No broomstick gun they'll hand you
No longer you'll pretend
You'll call some man your enemy
You used to call him 'friend'
And when the rockets thunder,
You'll hear your brothers cry
And through it all you'll wonder
Just why they had to die

So dream on, little broomstick cowboy,
Dream while you can
For soon, you'll be a dreadful thing
My son, you'll be a man
