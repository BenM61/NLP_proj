Your darkness grows
In fields of loneliness
Every breath
As cold as ice
Where lies are true painted black
Searching for some light to lead you back

Always the sun
After all
Always the sun
Like a wailing wall
Give me hope
Show some meaning

Always the sun
To strike a chord
Always the sun
To turn the world
Always

Your darkness grows
In fields of loneliness
Every breath
As cold as ice
Where lies are true painted black
Searching for some light to lead you back

Always the sun
After all
Always the sun
Like a wailing wall
Give me hope
Show some meaning

Always the sun
To strike a chord
Always the sun
To turn the world
Always
