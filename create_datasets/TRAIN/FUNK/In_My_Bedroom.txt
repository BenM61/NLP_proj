Sittin in my(2x)

Verse 1:
Never been known as a player, but ain't nobody gon say
But we don't even gots to go there now, you were so contagious
Always lookin famous, you took my heart I swear
Never saw it comin wen u said u was gone ooooh girl

Bridge:
But it was all about love
Never thought that you'd switch it up
Never knew how it felt
But I cant take it

Sittin in my bedroom, tryna get over you
Hopin you still think about me
Got me sittin in my bedroom
Tryna get over you
But I cant stop thinkin bout
The one I know I cant do without

Verse 2:
All my friends they told me
That u was bound to show me
That you's a gold digga didn't even know
But I know that my heart is
So torn up

That I cant I stand it so mixed up
But I still
Let it get to me
Said I aint goin out like that
But hear I stand

Brigde: but it was all about love
Never thought that you'd switch it up
Never knew how it felt
But I cant take it

Sittin in my bedroom, tryna get over you
Hopin you still think about me
Got me sittin in my bedroom
Tryna get over you
But I cant stop thinkin bout
The one I know I cant do without

Verse 3:
U play with mi heart girl
And I don't understand
Why still in mi eyes u
R the girl I want to be in mi life
