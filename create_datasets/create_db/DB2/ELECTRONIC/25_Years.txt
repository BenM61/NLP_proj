Don't leave me in the corner 
'Cause I just wanna go home
Don't lock me in the darkness 
'Cause I just wanna go home
Spent my life working on the land 
Trying for something of my own
Oh
It just ain't worth it
There's nothing in return

You can't take it with you when you go
One last look at daylight
The sun won't shine anymore

Everything was alright 
But now they're closing the door
I found out I wasted so much time

Now I'm trying to wash away the tears
Oh it just ain't worth it
Forget that pot of gold

There's nothing at the rainbow's end

Twenty-five years
I got twenty-five years 
Twenty-five years
I got twenty-five years

I found out I wasted so much time
Now I'm trying to wash away the tears
Oh
It just ain't worth it
Forget that pot of gold

There's nothing at the rainbow's end
It just ain't worth it
There's nothing in return

You can't take it with you when you go

Twenty-five years
I got twenty-five years, twenty-five years
I got twenty-five years
I got twenty-five years

It just ain't worth it
No oh
Twenty-five years
It just ain't worth it
No oh
Twenty-five years
It just ain't worth it
No oh
I got twenty-five years
It just ain't worth it
No, no no, no, no, no
Twenty-five years
It just ain't worth it
Just ain't worth it
Twenty-five years
It just ain't worth it

Ooh
