Look so careful
For a fault
Wait one minute
Say no more
Bewildered then
Bewildered now
Conceal forever
Is this the end?

I'm waiting, I'm changing

Now my eyes are 
Open wide
Fear in voice, 
I remember
Change in mood
I can sense it
Changing every day

I remember 
Infatuation
It's a figure of your 
Imagination
Through young times
Wilder minds
Conceal forever
Is this the end?

Change in mood
I can sense it
Changing every day

Words of meaning
Words of change
You look inside
There's nothing there
I can't, I can't  
No I can't
That's forever

Change in mood
I can sense it
Changing every day
Change in mood
I can sense it
Changing every day

Oh
Whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh
La la la la la
La la la la la
