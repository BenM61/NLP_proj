Walking around looking for a way
But no one tells me which way to go
I'm caught up in a world
Elaborath a maze
Where yes men could easily be known
I ask them no questions
They give me no answers
Following the wise
But they're walking in pampers
Give me a cigarette
Smoking my cancer
Drink the pain away
But I still have no answers

[Bridge]
I'm lost on a road
Don't know which way to go
I'm losing my mind
Losing control of the wheel
And I'm swerving
On and off the road

I'm lost on a road
But survival is a must
Don't know who I can trust
I'm living in a rush
I don't understand the fuss
My brain is bout to bust

[Chorus]
I think I'm losing it
I might be losing it
I just might lose
Am I losing my mind?
And I'm so confused I don't know what to do
And I need a clue before I run out of time
Am I losing it?
Am I losing it?
I think I'm losing
I'm losing my mind
Am I losing it?
Am I losing it?
I think I'm losing
I'm losing my mind

[Lil Wayne]
I'm a need counseling
I lost my mind and still haven't found it
I used to be so well-rounded
But now I tiptoe on hell's boundaries
F. Baby A.K.A. crazy
Trapped in a maze, therefore I am amazing
Block E the doc, I'm just a patient
And even with Navigation
I'm lost on a

[Gorilla Zoe and Lil Wayne]
I'm lost on a road
I, I, I don't know what's wrong with me
But, but I'm a keep that Styrofoam with me

I'm lost on a road
And I don't know what's wrong with me
Gorilla Zoe on the song with me
He must be gone with me

[Chorus]

I'm making this money
Just to go spend it
Living the good life
Hope nobody ends it
But who are you kidding?
Ay who are you lying to?
You know if they want you
Best believe they will find you

I'm lost on a road
And there's no one to talk to
There's nowhere to run to
I'm going in circles
I'm talking to myself
Got me blazing this purple

[Chorus]
