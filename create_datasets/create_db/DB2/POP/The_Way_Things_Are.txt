Come lay your head down and I'll keep you warm
I found a secret in the morning sun
I saw an angel in another time
I had to be there, had to make it mine

Oh god, take a look at my life
The way things are
Oh man, take a look at my hair
The way things are

It feels like sunshine when I get it right
I can't fight it when my spirit's down
I'm coming home now with another head
So I can take in all the things you said

Oh God, take a look at my face
The way things are
Oh man, take a look at my eyes
The way things are

I wanna know right now

Light a candle if it gets you through
And I can see me and I see a new you

Oh God, take a look at my songs
The way things are
Oh man, take a look at my friends
The way things are
