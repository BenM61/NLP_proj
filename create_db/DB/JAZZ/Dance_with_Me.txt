I saw this girl and she was tight 
Hey, go and talk to her 
I said, Ha, alright 
So grabbed a hold of her 
Got up in those eyes 
I didn't know what to do 
Or what to say 
Caught up in those eyes 

Girl I can't take what you're doing 
You're who I'm choosing 

Oh, shake it, like you got something girl 
Oh, like you rock my world (shake it)
Rock out your body 
Rockin' your body 
Dance with me. 
Shake it (girl I want that somethin' somethin')
Oh (I want that somethin' somethin')
Shake it (give me that somethin' somethin')

Now here we are, don't turn around 
I'm not getting what I see, what's going down 
I wanna take you home where we can be alone 
What you say girl, you comin' home with me? 
So we can be alone 

Girl I can't take what you're doing 
You're who I'm choosing 
Oh, shake it, like you got something girl 
Oh, like you rock my world (shake it)
Rock out your body 
Rockin' your body 
Dance with me. 
Oh, shake it, like you got something girl 
Oh, like you rock my world (shake it)
Rock out your body 
Rockin' your body 
Dance with me. 

If you wanna ride with gee 
You better come dance with me girl 
If you wanna come back to the suite 
You better come dance with me 
Say what? 2-3-4 

Girl I can't take what you're doing 
You're who I'm choosing 
Oh, shake it, like you got something girl 
Oh, like you rock my world (shake it)
Rock out your body 
Rockin' your body 
Dance with me. 
Shake it (girl I want that somethin' somethin')
Oh (I want that somethin' somethin')
Shake it (give me that somethin' somethin')
Shake it (girl I want that somethin' somethin')
Oh (I want that somethin' somethin')
Shake it (give me that somethin' somethin')

No I can't take what you're doing 
You're who I'm choosing. 
Ugh
