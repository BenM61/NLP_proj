Well I hear you talking and I see me walking
Let me make clear
I'm outta here, oh yah
You know it makes no sense to me
No way you gonna get no fence around me
Yap Yap

You known you talk too much, mmm yeh
Yap Yap you talk too much
Even in my sleep I hear you babe
But it makes me weep when I'm awake

When I hear the whispers, babe
The echoes coming round the bluff
I get all my secrets back
It's quite a shock

Mmm yeah, Yap Yap, you know you're talking too much
Mmm it's driving me, driving me
So what's the message
Why don't you talk to me

Yeah - it gets to me
Well I hear you talking
It makes no sense to me
Yap Yap you talk too much
