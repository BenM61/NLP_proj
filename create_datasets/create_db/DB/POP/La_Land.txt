I am confident, but
I still have my moments.
Baby, that's just me.

I'm not a supermodel
I still eat McDonalds.
Baby, that's just me.

Some may say I need to be afraid
Of losing everything.
Because of where I
Where I had my start,
Where I made my name
But everything's the same
In a la-la land machine. Machine.

Who said I can't wear my
Converse with my dress?
Oh, baby, that's just me!

And who said I can't be single
I have to go out and mingle.
Baby, that's not me
No, no.

Some may say I need to be afraid
Of losing everything.
Because of where I
Where I had my start
Where I made my name
But everything's the same
In the la-la land machine.

Tell me do you feel the way I feel
Cause nothing else is real
In la-la land to me!
Oh

Some may say I need to be afraid
Of losing everything.
Because of where I
Where I had my start
Where I made my name
When everything's the same
In la-la land machine
But, I'm not gonna change
In a la-la land machine
But I will stay the same
In la-la land

Machine

I won't change anything of my life
(i won't change anything of my life)
I'm staying myself tonight
(I'm staying myself tonight)
