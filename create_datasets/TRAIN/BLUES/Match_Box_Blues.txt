How far to the river, mama, walk down by the sea
How far to the river, walk down by the sea
I got those tadpoles and minnows all in over me

Standing here wonderin' will a matchbox hold my clothes
I'se sittin' here wonderin' will a matchbox hold my clothes
I ain't got so many matches but I got so far to go

Lord, Lord, who may your manager be?
Hey, mama, who may your manager be?
Reason I ask so many questions, can't you make friends match for me?

I got a girl cross town she crochet all the time
I got a girl cross town crochet all the time
Baby if you don't quit crochet-in you gnnna lose your mind

I wouldn'y mind marryin', but I can't stand settlin' down
I don't mind marryin', but Lord, settlin' down
I'm gonna act like a preacher so I can ride from town to town

Well, I'm leavin' town, but that won't make me stay
I'm leavin' town, cryin' won't make me stay
Baby, the more you cry, the farther you drive me away
