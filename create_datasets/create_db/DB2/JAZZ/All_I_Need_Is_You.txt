Sometimes when I'm down and alone
I feel just like a child with out a home
The love you give me keeps me hangin' on, honey
All I'll ever need is you

You're my first love, you're my last
You're my future, you're my past
Oh, loving you is all I ask, honey
All I'll ever need is you

Winters come and then they go
And we watch the melting snow
Sure, Summer follows Spring, all the things you do
Give me a reason to build my world around you
(World around you)

Some men follow rainbows I am told
Some men search for silver, some for gold
But I found my treasures in my soul
And all I'll ever need is you

Without love I'd never find the way
Through ups and downs of every single day
And I won't sleep at night until you say
Honey, all I'll ever need is you

La, la, la, la, la, la
The love you give me keeps me hangin' on
Honey, all I'll ever need is you

La, la, la, la, la, la
But I found my treasures in my soul
Honey, and all I'll ever need is you

La, la, la, la, la, la
