Whoa oh oh oh

Not everyone can be like me and Michael
The only problem is forgetting which side you're on
So you think the burning light will reappear on summer nights
Like all the rest, but they can't find out

Whoa oh oh oh

In every scene, it's me and Michael
Imaginary bombs raining down from the clouds
So it seems the danger signs will never let the feelings die
When all the best and brightest have gone

Me and Michael
Solid as they come
Me and Michael
It's not a question now
Me and Michael
Solid as they come
Me and Michael
It's not a question now
Me and Michael (Whoa oh oh oh)

Whoa oh oh oh

Binary star sink like the setting sun
Too happy with ourselves to notice when the change had come
So you think the losing side would never break dividing lines
When sanctity wasn't a thing of doubt

Me and Michael
Solid as they come
Me and Michael
It's not a question now
It's me and Michael
Solid as they come
Me and Michael
It's not a question now
Me and Michael (Whoa oh oh oh)
