Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you do it for love?
Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you do it for love?

Do you feel the same connection, make it right some way, some how
Does it come from your emotions, open up the door a little wider now
Do you try to find the feeling, that should never go away
Can it really be so easy, just to make the feeling stay

But when you hold me tight, oh, I know why you're doing it
Cause love can't be denied, when you prove it, do it for love

Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you do it for love?
(C'mon and prove it for love)
Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you do it for love?

When you promise it's the real thing, promises that stay the same
Is it really love that you're feeling
Or just another pleasure you can't explain
Lift the lid from your emotions, does it matter what they say
Will you follow your own footsteps, baby let your heartbeat show you the way

But when you hold me tight, oh, I know why you're doing it
Cause love can't be denied, when you prove it, do it for love

Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you do it for love?
Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you do it for love?
Do it for love

C'mon and prove it for love

When you do me, when you hold me, when you fool me
When you do it, do it, do it, come on and do it!

Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you do it for love?
Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you do it for love?

Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you do it for love?
Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you do it for love?

Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you do it for love?
Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you do it for love?

Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you do it for love?
Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you do it for love?
