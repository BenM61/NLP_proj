A long time ago, one dark night
There was a star in the east shining bright
Shepherds sitting out on a hill
Watching their sheep lying still

They got on their camels and began to ride
Didn't know how far, didn't know how wide
Followed the star to a keeper's stall
There found the greatest gift of all

(And the)
Real meaning of Christmas
(Talking 'bout the)
Real meaning of Christmas
You know the real meaning
Of Christmas is Christ

Over the years things have changed
Christmas day has lost it's zing
Instead of celebrating His birth
And praising His presents in the earth

We've turned this day into a fairytale
Frosty men and red-nosed deer
A holiday just for me
A sale on a shopping spree

To seek Him is still wise
And to find Him just look inside
If at this time we get real still
We find out what the meaning is

(For the)
Real meaning of Christmas
(I've found out the)
Real meaning of Christmas
Hey, the real meaning
Of Christmas is Christ
(Yes, it is)

Oh, now
Give gifts on that day
Well it's fine, it's okay
Alright to say "I love you"
Show someone you care

But when you give
Just give it in His name
Lift a heart and ease the pain
Make a child smile a while
