Escaped, I hide by myself
To take, the form of something else
A ghost, a thought
A bad school report
A shadow of remorse
An invisible force that is constantly forcing
This is the constant, the constant is calling

You said I never have a hold on you
The phantom hearts feel too
You said you never have a hold on me
The phantom I still see
You said I never have a hold on you
The phantom hearts feel too
You said you never have a hold

A love, a love without compare
Enough to love something not there
One embrace I take
Two hearts, one face
We kiss, we fall
With constant silence, two phantoms were born

You said I never have a hold on you
The phantom hearts feel too
You said you never have a hold on me
The phantom I still see
You said I never have a hold on you
The phantom hearts feel too
You said you never have a hold

Caught like two rabbits in the snare
Sheets are covered, skin is bare
I was broken, you repaired my soul
Smoke fills the air
Are we there, are we there
Are we there

You said I never have a hold on you
The phantom hearts feel too
You said you never have a hold on me
The phantom I still see
You said I never have a hold on you
The phantom hearts feel too
You said you never have a hold

This is the constant
The constant is calling
Become this monster who's constantly falling
What is this constant my heart is installing
Outside I'm content, but inside I'm balling

This is the constant
The constant is calling
Become this monster who's constantly falling
What is this constant my heart is installing
Outside I'm content, but inside I'm balling
