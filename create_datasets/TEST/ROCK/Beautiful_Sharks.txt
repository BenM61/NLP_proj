She was tracing out lines in the air
To make it perfectly clear
He was swimming with some beautiful sharks
Entertaining
The man behind the bar (x2)
And I was there
And somebody was talking about luck
And I thought, I thought what if my luck ran out?
Oh...
Hottest night in twenty years
He is playing out a ceremony
Playing out a ceremony
Watch him turn on the spot
To see his memory from a different angle
He eased the element of surprise
To curve and sweep lines
And he is singing an old song
He is swimming with some beautiful sharks
And I was there
And somebody was talking about romance
And I thought, I thought what if my luck ran out?
