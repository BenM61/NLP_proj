I'll give you all the love I've got cause you're here tonight, 
I'll give you all the love I've got and baby it's alright
We're sailing into the harbour 
Moonlight shining bright over the water
Been at sea for so long , drifting in a haze 
Been at sea for so long, now I want to stay
I'll give you all the love I've got cause you're here tonight 
I'll give you all the love I've got and baby it's alright

Give you all the love I've got - Oh yeah
Give you all the love I've got - Alright
Give you all the love I've got - Oh yeah
Give you all the love I've got - Oohoo

Don't make me wait anymore, 
travelled so far to reach your shore
Tomorrow is promised to the one 
So we should love each other if nothing else is done
I'll give you all the love I've got cause you're here tonight 
I'll give you all the love I've got, and baby it's alright
