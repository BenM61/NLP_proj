You might think I'm crazy, but I'm serious
It's better you know now
What I thought was happiness was only part-time bliss
You can take a bow
It was all just one big night out on the town
Riding in your limousine
We turned right and I say wrong which brings us to a stop
As the light is changing

Oh my meters running so I got to go now
It's the pleasure principle oh oh oh
It's the principle of pleasure Oh oh
It's the pleasure principle oh oh oh oh

It's true you want to build your life of guarantees
Hey take a ride in a big yellow taxi
I'm not here to feed your insecurities
I wanted you to love me
This has become an all too familiar scene
It's not the first time I paid the fare
Where'd you get the idea of material possession?
Thank you for the ride nowhere

And oh my meters running so I've really got to go
It's the pleasure principle oh oh oh oh oh

It's the principle of pleasure ohhh
It's the pleasure principle oh oh oh oh oh

I know - what you mean to me
Baby this is nowhere
You know - what became between you and me
human differential

It's the principle of pleasure
Oh ohhhh oh ohhhh
It's the pleasure principle - principle
Oh oh oh oh

You might say that I'm no good
I wouldn't trust your looks baby if I could
I got so many things I wanna do
before I'm through

Hey
It's the pleasure principle
It's the pleasure principle
Baby you can't hold me down
Baby you can't hold me down
After all the lovin' we've been through
And after all you've put me through
Yeah yeah, hey yeah

Love me, hey yeah, Love me yeah
Hoo hoo hoo hoo
It's the pleasure principle of love
yeah,yeah
