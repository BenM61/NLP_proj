Don't take her for granted, she had a hard time
Don't misunderstand her, don't play with her mind
Treat her so gently, it will pay you in time
Hey you've got to know, she's the sensitive kind

Tell her you love her, each and every night
You will discover, she will treat you right
If you believe, I know you will find
There ain't nothing like the sensitive kind

She gets so lonely, waiting for you
You are the only, thing to help her through
Don't take her for granted, she has a hard time
You've got to know, she's the sensitive kind
