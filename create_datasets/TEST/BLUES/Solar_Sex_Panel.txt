I'm goin' out and get me some sun 
Gonna collect it baby 
Then we can have a whole lot of fun 
Gonna reflect it baby 
That fossil fuel's got no renewal 
You know it couldn't hold a candle 
There ain't no spark in the dark 
Can touch my solar - Solar sex panel 
 
Got a fire up on top of my head 
I'm a love regenerator 
Why don't you get up off your tanning bed 
I'm an ultra-violet penetrator 
Don't sweat and toil with no heating oil 
'Cause Momma I'm hot to handle 
Gonna turn you up, gonna burn you up 
With my solar - solar sex panel 
 
Got a headache burnin' bad gasoline 
Well, I'm gonna relieve it baby 
My solar powered lovin' burns clean 
And you're gonna receive it baby 
And it's rude if it's crude 
Better try my solar - solar sex panel 
Better try my - come and get my 
Solar sex panel 
I'm gonna turn you up 
I'm gonna burn you up 
Better bet your ass I won't run outta gas
