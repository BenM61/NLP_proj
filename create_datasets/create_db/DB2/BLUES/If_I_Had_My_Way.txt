Peace came to me
So I met her in the middle
I said, "Show who you really are"

Peace came to me
Like a ring in my mind
How did I let it get this far?

If I had my way, if I had my way
I would take all your promises
And just shake 'em all off

Peace came to me
So I made a little wager
In a minute she can turn you inside-out

If I had my way, if I had my way
I would take all your promises
And just shake 'em all off

If I had my way, if I had my way
I would take all your promises
And just sink 'em all

You breathe, I listen
You sleep and I stare
You wake and I'm already there
Already there

Peace came to me
I pretended, I was sleeping
Then I woke up and slipped into a dream

If I had my way, if I had my way
If I had my way, if I had my way

If I had my way, if I had my way
I would take all your promises
And just shake 'em all, shake 'em all

If I had my way, if I had my way
If I had my way, if I had my way
