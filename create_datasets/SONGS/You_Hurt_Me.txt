Last night you told me
That we were through
And all the time, I thought
That your love was true

You me, you hurt me so
You know you hurt me
When you let me go

You always told me
We'd never, ever part
But now you turn around
And break my loving heart

You me, you hurt me so
You know you hurt me
When you let me go

I'm begging, please come back to me!
A life is now at stake
And if you don't soon return
You're gonna drive me to my grave

You me, you hurt me so
You know you hurt me
When you let me go

I'm begging, please come back to me!
A life is now at stake
If you don't soon return
You're gonna drive me to my grave

You me, you hurt me so
You know you hurt me
When you let me go

Ooh, you hurt me
You hurt me
You hurt me so
