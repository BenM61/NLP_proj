I've heard it all before
You haven't heard a word I've said
All your lies and all your games
Are not for me
Don't even say no more
Your empty lies and evil ways
Disrespect and lack of love
I cannot see

All you ever do is cheat on me
But I am too scared to see
I just don't want you to ever leave me
I'm afraid that you'd be gone
I just don't want you to ever leave me

Your empty promises
You got my back against the wall
Tainted packs and lack of trust
I cannot be
Now I'm out the door
I'm not turning back no more
Now I'll be gone forever
I know you'll be

All you ever do is cheat on me
But I am too scared to see
I just don't want you to ever leave me
I'm afraid that you'd be gone
I just don't want you to go

Bring it out now

All you ever do is cheat on me
But I am too scared to see
I just don't want you to ever leave me
I'm afraid that you'd be gone
I just don't want you to ever leave me
