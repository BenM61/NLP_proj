Lights are out in the street where I stand 
It sure would be great to have a clock with no hands 
Met a man said he was wise and in tune 
Lazy Sundays turn to Mondays to soon 

He said take my hand let us walk through' that door 
I said I walk with my feet and I've been through' it before 
The end is nigh son I said I suppose 
If it is we must be pretty damn close 

Ain't no stone unturned 
No wiseguy's gonna put me down 
Ain't no song unheard 
But it laughs back at you now 
And that might put you down 

With bloodshot eyes he was letting me know 
He said ten years from now I said a hundred ago 
Don't you leave now I know you will fail 
I said that's old news I'm sorry gotta bail 

Ain't no stone unturned 
No wiseguy's gonna put me down 
Ain't no song unheard 
But it laughs back at you now 
And that might put you down

No wiseguy's gonna put me down 
Ain' t no song unheard 
But it laughs back at you now 
Right back at you now
