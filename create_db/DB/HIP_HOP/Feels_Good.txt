Eh yo  why am I gonna sit here and let ya'll bug me 
'Cause I got a dime and a girl who love me 
And when we alone she ain't all lovey dovey 
Smacks me on the ass and says fast nigga f*ck me 

And uh I don't do nothing for my baby girl to not trust me 
I don't do nothing for her to bust me 
I would love her if her rings were rusty
Feet were crusty and arms were musty 

'Cause ain't nobody gettin' that just me 
And ain't nobody hittin' that just me 
If I cheat I know that she will bust me, crush me 
'Cause she know how many girls lust me 

Back in the day they wouldn't even touch me 
Now they say they don't want nobody but me 
To tell the truth, them girls just disgust me 
'Cause I already found the one that love me 

[Chorus: x2]
It's all good lovin' somebody 
As long as somebody loves you back 

Mess with her? I ain't have to 
But player I was glad to brown skin dove 
But her love won't pass you promised her a ring 
Along with a shine never stressin' my rhyme 

All she wanted is time, where you find her at 
'Cause you a grimy cat 
Puffin' dime sacks to see where my mind be at 
And I told my other niggas that I told her yo 

I don't always have to hit the twat 
Just to get you hot you don't believe me 
Then pick a spot but remember, I lick a lot 
Ayyo she likes to trick a lot just to get a bigger knot 

Loves to see her nigga hot worries if I'm jigged or not 
And her stuff hot and divine 
And the things she cops top of the line 
Baby is hot and divine always poppin' some wine 
And then she told me Cam, I got a rock on my mind 

[Chorus: x2]

It feels good when you love em' 
And they lovin you back go tit for tat 
Never scratch your back 
Matter of fact she touches and grabs 

Not to lust you bad just to get you mad 
When we alone she screams and moans 
She don't front on me 'cause she don't want to be alone 
Come on everybody needs somebody 

Ay Papi, take her out 
Uh-huh no doubt 
Then we lace her out 
Uh-huh no doubt 
Then we ski her out 

Ski her out 

Then we eat her out 

Eat her out 

Come on, where your man at? 
Where's your plans at? 
You ain't go away this year, where your tan at? 
'Cause me and ma just came from the tropics 
Wit her legs cocked and she beggin' me to stop it

[Chorus]
