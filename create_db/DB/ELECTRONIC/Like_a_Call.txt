All the cars down the bottom, windmill chasing
calling police so, so we're placing
weight on minds
Red sports car Northwest dated, counting the sleeps
I'm counting, waiting
stalled inside

There's no tires to save our skins
(they're bald and old)
their advice won't change our plans

Through an old telescope for close up faces
you're cornering the fire it works in your favor
televized
Like the all night long at 3am feeling
you get in your legs when you're dancing on the ceiling
friends of mine

And you change the beat disguised
like a call to realize

you just made a pass in that reflection
you're fixing your hair or asking questions
you decide
turn it around, the place is a fountain youth, you're squealing
offering advice that sounds appealing
nervous fun

'cept the cheating's in your blood
and the hardest word is love

Let's not starve here today, none of that behavior
(i'm not revealing, unless your feelings are long term)
eating like a princess, I'm gonna save you
stay at mine
And we're carving up the courses we're not playing
(i'm not revealing, unless your feelings are long term)
don't want to hear the swear words you're spraying
undermined

I'm not revealing unless your feelings are long term 
I'm not revealing unless your feelings are long term
I'm not revealing unless your feelings are long term

It's like a, it's like a call
It's like a, it's like a call
It's like a, it's like a call
