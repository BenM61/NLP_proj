You are astronomical fans of alcohol
So welcome in
Are rising in the East and setting in the West
All waving flags

We're all waving flags now
Waving flags
But don't be scared

And you, you will be here for a while
And it's all a joke
Oh, it's all a joke
Oh

Are here of legal drinking age, on minimum wage
Well, welcome in
From across the Vistula, you've come so very far
All waving flags

We're all waving flags now
Waving flags
But don't be scared

'Cause you, you will be here for a while
And it's all a joke
Oh, it's all a joke
Oh

Beer is not dark
Beer is not light
It just tastes good
Especially tonight

(Oh welcome in)

So welcome in, we are barbarians
Oh welcome in, across the Carpathians
Oh welcome in, we are from Slavia
Oh welcome in, across the stadion (?)
Oh we cant fail, not with Czech ecstasy
No we won't fail, not with Czech ecstasy
So welcome in
