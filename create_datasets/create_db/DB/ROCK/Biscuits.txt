Biscuits for breakfast, cup of tea for the man
4 more years of this shit and I'll be on 16 grand
pushing the trolley, doing the rounds
4 more years of this shit and I'll be one of these clowns

in my office
on the fifth floor
biscuits for breakfast

biscuits for breakfast, cup of tea for the man
4 years on in this game and I'm on 16 grand
I want chocolate, gimme some cake

in my office
on the fifth floor
biscuits for breakfast

over a barrel, or over my trolley
over the desk it's all the same
pushing the message don't hate the player hate the game
s'all the same

in my office
on the fifth floor
I can see the world go round beneath me
biscuits for breakfast
I can see my world pan out before me

I can see my world pan out before me
I can see my world pan out before me
I can see my world pan out before me
I can see my world pan out before me
