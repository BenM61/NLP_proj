If you never say goodbye 
To the best thing in your life 
There are things you don't appreciate 
At all 

So it's best that you don't try 
Holding back the time 
Are you ever gonna be 
Quite satisfied 

Postcard from heaven 
Go to where you belong 
Never find the perfect situation 
until you know where you're from 

If you ever say goodbye 
No regrets, I won't ask why 
And I wish you all the best luck 
In the world 

Should you ever change your mind 
Holding back the sunshine 
Are you ever gonna be 
Quite satisfied 

Postcard from heaven 
Go to where you belong 
Never find the perfect situation 
until you know where you're from 

Postcard from heaven 
Go to where you belong 
Never find the perfect situation 
until you know where you're from
