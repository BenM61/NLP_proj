You had made a good impression, girl
Then you suddenly changed direction
I'll be strong now with my head held down
Could you keep on running around

A feeling for you, woman is all that I got
Could I trust you, tell me whether or not
Could I lay back and leave my heart to you
Do you know anything about being true

I doubt it, woman I doubt it, yeah
'Cause everybody knows and only it shows
That you're a bad risk, yeah

Too many good things about you
But your past make me doubt you
Too many fellas hang around you
Messing up your mind

I am a believer
You are a deceiver
You make me the griever
You leave me behind

I could see it as a matter of fact
I'm gonna show you woman
I'm gonna show you where is at
I'm gonna give you everything that's so fine
Woman, baby, could you be all mine

I doubt it, woman I doubt it, yeah
'Cause everybody knows and only it shows
That you're a bad risk, yeah
