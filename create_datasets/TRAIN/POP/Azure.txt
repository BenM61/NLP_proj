Driftin' Dreamin'
In an Azure mood,
Stardust gleamin' 
Thru my solitude:
Here in my seclusion, 
You're a blue illusion 
While I'm in this Azure interlude.
I'm not wanted I'm so all alone;
Always haunted
By the dreams I own;
But, though Im tormented
I must be contented 
Driftin' Dreamin' 
In an Azure mood!
Driftin' Dreamin'
In an Azure mood,
Star dust gleamin'
Thru my solitude:
Here in my seclusion, 
You're a blue illusion
While I'm in this Azure interlude!
