Punch to the face
Makes you hit the floor
Such a disgrace
And you came back for more

What do you waste
What do you score
A wicked embrace
A willful rapport

Stuck in the waste
Caught in the waste

Blood on the face
Makes you hit the floor
Such a disgrace
And you came back for more

What do you waste
What do you score
A wicked embrace
A willful rapport

Stuck in the waste
Caught in the waste

(break)
(Chorue twice)
(break)
Stuck in the waste
Caught in the waste
