Check it out, Joe 
I'll tell you a secret if you know where to keep it 
And you promise not to tell 
Got a tale or two about a girl 
That you could have sworn you knew so well 
It was years ago, though it sounds like yesterday 
You came on strong and she gave it all away 

He had an angel's face, defied his grace, and an ace sittin' up his sleeve 
But never mind, ''cause love is blind, and she needed to believe 
His touch could feel, he held her safe from harm 
If thoughts could kill, she'd have died there in his arms 

Deep in the dark, ooh-oh-oh 
The thunder in her heart, ooh-oh-oh 
He told her every single lie 
He swore he'd never told anyone before 

Check it out, Joe 
Now you wake up in the dead of night, and reach out to touch her hair 
But the bed is empty, turn on the light, and she's not even there 
Then a note she wrote, you read that thing and weep 
''cause if you love someone, and never know what runs so deep 

Deep in the dark, ooh-oh-oh 
The thunder in her heart, ooh-oh-oh 
She told you every single lie 
She swore she'd never heard before 
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha 

Deep in the dark, ooh-oh-oh 
The thunder in her heart, ooh-oh-oh 
She told you every single lie 
She swore she'd never heard before 
Two, three, four
