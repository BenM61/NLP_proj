All I know is everything is not as it's sold
But the more I grow, the less I know
And I have lived so many lives, though I'm not old
And the more I see, the less I grow
The fewer the seeds, the more I sow

Then I see you standing there
Wanting more from me
And all I can do is try
Then I see you standing there
Wanting more from me
And all I can do is try, try

I wish I hadn't seen all of the realness
And all the real people are really not real at all
The more I learn, the more I learn
The more I cry the more I cry
As I say goodbye to the way of life
I thought I had designed for me

Then I see you standing there
Wanting more from me
And all I can do is try
Then I see you standing there
I'm all I'll ever be
But all I can do is try, oh try, try, try

All of the moments that already passed
We'll try to go back and make them last
All of the things we want each other to be
We never will be, we never will be

And that's wonderful, that's life
That's you baby, this is me baby
We are, we are, we are, we are
We are, we are free in our love
We are free in our love
Try
