What's that sound...this poundin' in my head
The beat's so loud...got me tossin' in my bed
I been avoidin' it for too long
I can love 'em and leave 'em...
Then I can't go wrong
But that kinda love don't get you too far
...leaves you out by back door

It's a strange strange fire...
Burns me when I'm touchin' you
It's a strange strange fire...
It's a strange strange fire...

What's that sound...this ringin' in my ears
The beat keeps poundin' (turn it up)
Now my time is drawin' near
Gotta get on with this emotion
Got my back to the wall...
Your devotion makes me...
Cry like a baby...and now I can't let go

It's a strange strange fire...
Burns me when I'm touchin' you
It's a strange strange fire...
It's a strange strange fire...
Standin' on the edge of...
Such a strange strange fire

I been watchin' you...
I found out where you sleep...
I hear the names you call...
And the company you keep...
It's an endless fight...
For an endless love...
Now I'm reachin' down inside...
Gonna find out what I want

It's a strange strange fire...
Burns me when I'm touchin' you
It's a strange strange fire...
It's a strange strange fire...
Standin' on the edge of...
Such a strange strange fire

It's a strange strange fire
It's a strange strange fire
It's a strange strange fire...
Burn me baby
It's a strange strange fire...
