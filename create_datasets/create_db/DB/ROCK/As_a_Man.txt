If I was a man in all but my body
Oh would I now understand you completely
If I was a man in all but my body

If I was walking and talking
As a man

Oh it is dark
And now you will meet me
Something has changed I feel it discreetly
Oh now I feel; now I feel you completely

When you're not walking and talking

As a man

Closer, closer closer
To one breath

When you're not walking and talking
As a man
