[Verse 1]
Listen baby, sometimes I know I be playin but set aside the bulls***, I'ma grown a** man.
Whats to understand that I love to f***, Can I hit it from the back or put ya a** in a buck?
Screamin Shawty what's up, are we f***in' are what, We aint got nothin to discuss im simply tryin to bust nuts.
The temperatures risin', We reachin the bed, Ya eyes begin to roll in the back of ya head.

[Verse 2]
Bangin' Headboards, The loud noise, The sound of you screamin.
Turn me on cus it sound like you singin'.
Sayin my name constantly, Sayin' daddy keep f***in me.
Get it how you want it long as you keep lovin' me.
Put ya thing down,
Boom the bedroom do it right,
And it jus might be a long night, Alright,
Now be Quiet you dont want them to hear us outside,
let me get on bottom while you ride.

[Chorus]
Bedroom Boom, (Thats whats goin down tonight),
Bedroom Boom, (Let me do ya body right),
My bed will be boomin' for you... (boom boom)
Bedroom boom, (All between the sheets baby)
Bedroom boom, (I wanna drive you crazy),
My bed will be boomin for you.

[Verse 3 (Avant)]
It feels like heaven when were off in this room together.
I Can hear the music playin, then I hear ya voice sayin,
"Ohh daddy now jus give it to me right there." "Ohh baby, Take a handfull of my hair."
Cus you like it rough (rough) cant get enough (nough).
Cus im the type of n**** thats gon fill you up, like a cup.
And make this love thing overflow,
I wont stop until ya body's tellin me so.
Sheets gettin' sticky from the strawberries and whipped cream,
If these walls could talk they would say this is one hell of a scene.
Now you movin ya body jus like a gymnist,
From the bed to the dresser, All type a' crazy s***.
Case is tellin me stories, Body's hot and so horny,
Hittin it from the rear, Wanna wisper somethin in yo ear. "I'm gonna love you all night... I promise."

[Chorus 2]
Bedroom boom, (Bedroom boom!!)
Bedroom boom, (I can hear it baby!)
My bed will be boomin' for you, (We'll be F***in all night, yes..)
Bedroom boom, (Hittin yo body!)
Bedroom boom, (Like boom boom boom!)
My bed will be boomin' for you, (My bed will be shakin' til' the screws come loose, while im off in it)

[Verse 4]
Boom goes the bedroom, Behind closed doors, And the bedroom depends on how far things go.
You move slow or move fast when you off in that a**, But you hittin' that mothaf***er like everytime yo last.
Spread yo legs like a bald eagle, Work that back, Move like a snake when you do dat dat.
Now be quiet, You dont want them to hear us outside.
Let me get on bottom while you ride.

[Verse 5]
You hotter than an album store, (Yea) Temptation got ya outta control, (Mmm Hmmm), You tremblin' like you
out in the cold, You screamin' you cant take it no more. Beat the p**** so bad we done fell on the flo.
(Can you believe it?) Throw our clothes in the kitchen and in the garage. All this love is waitin for you
like im El' Depoge. See my dick stay hard. (Oh) And its gon stay c***ed. (Yes) If a b**** f*** wit me she
gettin her cherry popped.

[Chorus 3]
Bedroom boom, (This is serious business, Baby)
Bedroom boom, (What goes on in this room, So what baby..)
My bed will be boomin' for you, (Say Boom! boom!)
Bedroom boom, Bedroom boom, (And it feels amazing!)
