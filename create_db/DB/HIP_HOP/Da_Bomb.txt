Just know you won't be equipped to what it takes to break this krossed

I'm bad suckas if ya wanna know what I'm talkin about 
So lay your cards on the table cause I'm able to rock 
When ever, where ever I still rocks the cradle 
Cause i'm a nappy happy bad little sun-of-a-gun

Tiffy-tiffy tough neck 
Cause what gettin' 'nough respect 
And all those little punks talkin' junk bring it on 
Cause I just love takin' punks outta homes

Well, here it

I'll be coming around the mountain when I come droppin' a bomb 
Creepin' up on those Romper Room suckas who wanna get some 
So feel the wrath of a brat with the Mac pack 
Walkin' away you're like the bottom of a door mat 
I didn't gain props cause I was a suckas daughter 
I had to earn them droppin' dynamite like Jimmy Walker 
I can pay Donny Mars in a sticky cage 
Give me 30-30 half-caliber half-gauge 
And if you don't know what I'm talkin' about 
Test me out 
We're in the big part of in The Last Boyscout 
Scopin' a needle is like a needle in a haystack 
Press the new rookie breakin' rims down like Shaq 
You think you're dealin' with a weak boy step back 
Cause I'm comin' up like a Veteran on a phat track 
I'm bein' all I wanna be so you tell Uncle Tom 
Dat Da Brat done drop da bomb

I know you hear me comin here I come 
So you besta watch ya back 
it's da bomb 
I know you hear me comin here I come 
And I am what they call Da Brat
