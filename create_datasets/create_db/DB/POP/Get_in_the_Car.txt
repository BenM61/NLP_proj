Let's go and take a starlit drive
To where the shaping of our lives
Had just begun when we were young

When everything was coming right
In our dreams of love and life
And we could run into the sun

Get in the car
We're taking a ride
We're looking for stars
We're looking for satellites
Of love
Of love

Changes coming, changes gone
We just want to be someone
Behind the tears, behind the tears

Nights and days go on and on
And things are coming out all wrong
And no one hears, and no one hears

Get in the car
We're taking a ride
We're looking for stars
We're looking for satellites

Get in the car
We're taking a ride
You'll be the star
I'll be your satellite
Of love
Of love

Let's go and take a ride
To all those starry nights
We used to fly upon when we were young

When everything was coming right
In all our dreams of love and life
And we would run into the sun
Nothing's gonna get me down
