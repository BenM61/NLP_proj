Mary has a heart of coal
She'll break you down and eat you whole
I saw her do it after school
She's an animal

She won't ever love no boy
She'll treat you like a fucking toy
She'll break your heart and steal your joy, like a criminal

I wanna know like you
I wanna know like you
I wanna be that cool
I wanna be that

Mary keeps you off her mind
She wants to spend her weekend right
Out with her friends just getting high, like a stoner girl
And you wait outside on her street
You sit for hours just to see
The girl you pictured in a dream as the only girl

I wanna know like you
I wanna know like you
I wanna be that cool
I wanna be that
I wanna know like you
I wanna know like you
I wanna be that cool
I wanna be that
