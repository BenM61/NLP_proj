Form the south to the bottom

And if you never been down south before 
We bout to show why'all how we ridin (get up, get up)
So where ever you from (yea)

For the gurls in the club that be shakin that thang
And the got the young playas comin up want to run things
Why'all see them gurls when they in them g-strangs
Now everybody want to be down wit da south

Yo I'm from the state where the sun shine
Where the women are pretty and they so fine
Where the dudes are rude but they so cool
Listen, good weather is better for a good fella
And every ride will probably be on twenty's or twenty four's on T-0's
And you know like I know, we gon' represent it everywhere we go
And every time we drop hits 
For hittin' everything we spit it gots to be the shit
So gimme a fresh white tee
A pair of Priest jeans and some j's why'all never seen
Man I can't help but win
On heavy rotation 
On all of your stations
Down south takin' over all of the charts 
We jus got started and will not stop

Be like down south show a lil change
For the gurls in the club that be shakin that thang
And the got the young playas comin up want to run things
Why'all see them gurls when they in them g-strangs
Now everybody want to be down wit da south
(now everybody want to be down wit da south)
Now everybody tryin to get down wit da south
(now everybody tryin to get down wit da south) 'cause

You ain't never seen a big ol' ass like this
And you ain't never gon' run across a badder bitch
I'm Ms Trina, Miami's finest
And you can ask your man who has the flyest
Playas who millionaires try to buy this
And I ain't got shit to hide
I like to squat and ride
Go front and back, side to side
Bend me over show me what you holdin'
And oh shit, now give it to me, gimme that big ol' dick
First suck me up, and then buck me up
Go deeper, deeper, beat me, beat me,
Lets make a sequel for the naked people
Your whole click against my click
Now shake that ass, shake that ass
Shake that ass and make your baby daddy mad

Be like down south show a lil change
For the gurls in the club that be shakin that thang
And the got the young playas comin up want to run things
Why'all see them gurls when they in them g-strangs
