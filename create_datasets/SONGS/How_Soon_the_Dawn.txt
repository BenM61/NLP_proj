Just look how far I've fell
Down in the wishing well, you'd forgotten
I spent time in your head

I thought I knew it all
How the mighty fall to the bottom
You spent time in your bed

How soon the dawn
Of love has come
And made you run
You've come undone

I've been feeling it too
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

You took the subway down
Until the day you've found it was broken
Now it can't take you away

Was just a silly thought
Until the day you caught me in action
You're knowing me less everyday

How soon the dawn
Of love has come
And made you run
You've come undone

I've been feeling it too
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
