Ho, why should you go to the left
Why should I go to the right
Why must we argue this way
Why must we fuss and fight

Oh, together we can make such sweet music
Together we can make it right
Oh, together we can make such sweet music
Together we can make it right, mmm, mmm

Now when you're feelin' bad, I am feelin' it too
Whatever your dreams are I'll share them with you
Till life has ended I'll stay by your side
You are my sunshine and you are my pride

Oh, together we can make such sweet music
Together we can make it right
Whoa, whoa, together we can make such sweet music
Together we can make it right, ooh, ooh

Whoa, whoa, I know the love we share is locked in our hearts
And there is nothing that can tear us apart
Wherever you are that's where I'll be
I'll keep this love that you've given to me

Whoa, together we can make such sweet music
Together we can make it right
Whoa, whoa, together we can make such sweet music
Together we can make it right
