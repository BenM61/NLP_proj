I need a fix
A little one
And then it's over
Then I'm done
I got my own
I need to find
But in between
You are a lifeline

But if I do (stop)
But if I don't (stop)
It doesn't matter
I probably won't (stop)
Without you here
Without your love
The world is just there
It doesn't move me

I want it now
I want it bad
And when it's done
I'll start over
And I can give
Oh I could give
But when your're in
I give better

Without you here
Without your love
The world is just there
It doesn't move me

I got my own
I need to find
But in between
You are a lifeline
