Mississ-ippi river
Is so long, deep and wide
I can see my good girl
Standin' on that other side

I cried an I called
I could not make my baby hear
Lord, I'm 'on get me a boat, woman
Paddle on away from here

Ain't it hard to love someone
When they are so far from you
Lord, I'm on' get me a boat and
Paddle this old river blue

I went down to the landing
To see if any boats were there
And the fareman told me
Could not find the boats nowhere

The big boat ease up the river
Are turnin' 'round an 'round
Lord, I'm 'on get me a good girl
Or jump overboard an drown
