Is this the love 
I got to feel the music 
Is this the love 
-Watching you, watching me- 
Is this the love 

Came in this place, and saw your face 
I saw you dancing, dance to trance 
Your body's swing, made my bells ring 
I wished that we started romance 
All the people in the house 
They share our destination 
Love, groove, dance and sex 
That's party combination 
Burn, burn, our hearts burn 
To the point of no return 
Burn, burn, our hearts burn 
To the point of no return 
Move, move, on and on 
Come on, people, get it done 
Move, move, on and on 
Come on, people, get it done 

Time is right to get all up 
Feel the music's energy 
This dance will bring us to the top 
Forget all days' misery 
Night time makes us sensitive 
For dance and sax and laughter 
Forget about all negative 
And get the things you're after 
Come on, come on, get it done 
Come on, come on, get it done 
Sensitive, you're sensitive 
Forget about all negative 
Feel the music's power now 
Come close to me I'll show you how 
Music's beat fly through the air 
Here, there and everywhere
