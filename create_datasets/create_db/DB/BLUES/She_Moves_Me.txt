She moves me, man
Honey, and I don't see how it's done 
She moves me, man
Honey, and I don't see how it's done 
She got a pocket full of money
Little doll don't try to help me, though 

She move me when she get drunk
Then she say I'm not nowhere 
She call me a dumbbell
She say I'm nothing but a square 

She moves me man
Honey, and I don't see how it's done 
She got a pocket full of money
The little girl don't try to help me, though 
What kinda woman is that?

She move a crazy man
Who say "now I'm not so dumb" 
I take her to a funeral boy
The dead jumped up to run 
She look at a deaf and dumb boy
Said "now I can speak" 
She shook her finger in a blind man's face
"Once was blind but now I see" 

She moves me man
Honey, and I don't see how it's done 
She gotta pocket full of money
The little girl don't try to help me, though
