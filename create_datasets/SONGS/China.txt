Danced with wind and danced with fire
Killed the truth and called the liar
Bleeding in its mystery when the moon began to fall
Dreamers are not all they seem,
Sleeping in her silent dream
She locks it all inside and hides it all away

China, China

Calling out to history
Is that the way it will always be?

China, China

Questions in my hand, and then
Answers gone till I don't know when

verse:
All you speak and all you hear
Hand that's strong and voice it's clear
An unforgotten memory when the moon begins to call
Called you right and called you wrong
Time, the shadow, sings your song
Don't lock it all inside and hide it all away

China, China 4x
