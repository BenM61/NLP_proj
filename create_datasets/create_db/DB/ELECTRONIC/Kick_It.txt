How do you do that cool dance? 
Baby don't split those hot pants 
I got these moves that we can do to and sing 
I don't look too good in pink 

I use to slash myself up 
I like to play it tough 
Cuts, bruises, blood oozes, bones breaking rough 
You gotta handle that stuff 

Yeah yeah, tear it up, rip it up, kick it up 
Yeah yeah, tear it up, rip it up, kick it up 
Yeah yeah, kick it, kick it, kick it 

I want to be your cat 
Screw that! 
I'm not sixteen but I got leather boots and suede 
Ah go f*ck your pain away 

I heard you like kinky shit 
That just depends who I'm with 
What is it S&M or some kind of toy? 
Like you said search and destroy 

Some people don't like my crotch 
Because it's got fuzzy spots 
But if you flame it, It's a neat burning bush baby 
And that is just what I've got 

Yeah yeah, tear it up, rip it up, kick it up 
Yeah yeah, tear it up, rip it up, kick it up 
Yeah yeah, tear it up, rip it up, kick it up 
Yeah yeah, kick it, kick it, kick it 

And if you lay down with sin 
Escape the city I'm in 
Come on and knock'em where its rocking non-stop 
Make your way to Berlin
