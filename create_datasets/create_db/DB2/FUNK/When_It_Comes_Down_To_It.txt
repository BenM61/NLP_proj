(m. riperton r. rudolph)

When it comes down to it and it's time I get it on
Ain't no way to do it
You can find yourself alone
All you high falutin' ain't worth nothin' when you're old
When it comes down to it
Love will get you more than gold
When it comes down to it
When it comes down to it

When it comes down to it
There'll be dancin' in the night
Cause now the fools who blew it will be hidin' from the light
So mama tell your children not to feel so all alone
Cause when it comes down to it
He'll be there to take us home

We can get back to the garden
If we keep our karma high, yeah
We were meant to love each other
Like the birds wer meant to fly

When it comes down to it
There'll be dancin' in the night
Cause now the fools who blew it will be hidin' from the light
So mama tell your children not to feel so all alone
Cause when it comes down to it
He'll be there to take us home

When it comes down to it
