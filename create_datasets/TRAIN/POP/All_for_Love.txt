Love was in her heart
But I had dreams to find before I could see
I asked her if she'd wait for me
But I was gone too long
Tears were in her eyes
She said I took our love and threw it away
And nothin' I could do or say
Could bring it back again

I was tryin' to be somethin' more
Than the man I had come to be
I never meant to leave her sad and lonely
If only she could see

I did it all for love
All for love
'Cause nothin' really matters if it's strong enough
All for love
All for love
No, nothin' really matters if you've got enough

She walked out that door
And all my dreams went with her into the night
I wondered how a love so right
Could ever slip away
Love was in her heart
But I had dreams to find before I could see
That somewhere deep inside of me
She'll always be the one

I was tryin' to be somethin' more
Than the man I had come to be
Never meant to leave her sad and lonely
If only she could see

I did it all for love
All for love
'Cause nothin' really matters if it's strong enough
All for love
All for love
No, nothin' really matters if you've got enough

I did it all for love
All for love
'Cause nothin' really matters if it's strong enough
All for love
All for love
No, nothin' really matters but I want her by my side

I did it all for love
All for love
'Cause nothin' really matters if it's strong enough
All for love
All for love
No, nothin' really matters but I want her
