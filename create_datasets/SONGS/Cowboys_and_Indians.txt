It's a long fast dance
Well the long fast dance of progress
And the long slow waltz of decay
Made such a natural born couple

They settled down right here in the USA
Dream home for two in the USA
Hot jazz, cool blues, we got country
We get rock and roll all day

Like to dance, come on down get funky
That's the way, that's the way
That's the way hey, hey in the USA
There's still cowboys and indians at home on the range

But the cowboys and indians have changed - they've changed
We've got James Dean on the silver screen
We've got James Brown he won't let you down
Now Elvis was the king of rock and roll

We got preacher men who want to save your soul
Got the motorcity with the Motown beat
Get hip to the beat on the hip hop street
Stars and bars and the biggest cars

And a rocket ship take you up to Mars
There's the east coast trip where it's real uptight
Where you work all day and you play all night
And the west coast side with the laid back scene

When you just lay back and it seems like a dream
There's a lot of places in between
There's Hollywood and the city by the bay
And the whole damn south down Louisiana way, way, way

That's the way, that's the way hey, hey in the USA
There's still cowboys and indians at home on the range
But the cowboys and indians have changed, the've changed
In the land of the free and the home of the brave

The cowboys and cowgirls and indians have changed
Baby, baby, baby
That's the way, that's the way in the USA
Cowboys and indians...

Home on the range
