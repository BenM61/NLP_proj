Now we're in twin cities, where the Mississippi rises and then falls. 
One is Minneapolis, the other though less famous, is St. Paul. 
There are stray dogs on the highway and the local farmers moan about lack of rain. 
When the winds blew last winter I'd swear England had another hurricane. 

And we are twin cities and we are that river. 
From the standing still, we will be delivered.
The last time in new york was with Mandela and Madonna and the Mets. 
For icons of an era, well, that's about as famous as it gets. 

I've seen cities full of ticker tape and cotton trains through Utah disappearing out of sight. 
And now I'm standing in a city that's as pretty as an ocean in the night. 
And we are twin cities and we are that ocean. from the standing still, we are set in motion. 
And no one calls me up to say, "how long are you going to be away?" 

No one calls me up to say, "don't let that life lead you astray"
They were rioting in Detroit on the night the pistons won it back to back. 
I was out of there the next day and I only had just two bags to pack. 
And we are twin cities and we are one river. 

From the standing still, we will be delivered. and we are twin cities and we are one ocean. 
From the standing still, we are set in motion.
