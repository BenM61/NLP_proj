Here in your arms soft and warm 
I'm at peace with the world once again 
At the end of a long weary day we embrace 
Once again I've the world in my arms'

Just like a ship lost at sea 
That's been tossed by the wind and the waves 
I return to the haven I know will be there 
And again I've the world in my arms

So press me close to the soul 
And the heart of you love 
By the beat of a heart that is true 
I'm content though I know that 
My worldly possessions are few 
For in you I've a world full of love 
So let me stay, let me stay, that in you 
I've the world in my arms
I've the world in my arms'
