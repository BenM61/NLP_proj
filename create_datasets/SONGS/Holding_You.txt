Everyone has words to say 
And they make me strong 
Hear the sound 
Won't you take my hand 
Just a smile and your embrace 
I can do no wrong 
Turn around say you understand 

Holding you I fear no evil 
I can feel the love inside you 
Holding you holding you loving you 
Holding you could be so easy 
I can feel your arms around me 
Holding you holding you loving you 

When the daylight fades away 
And I'm on my way 
Fantasy a world without a storm 
Can we really feel the way people say we do 
Won't you find you're here to keep me warm 

Holding you could be so easy 
I can feel your arms around me 
Holding you holding you loving you 
Holding you could be so easy 
I can feel your arms around me 
Holding you holding you loving you
