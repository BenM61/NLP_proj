I can prove anything
I'll make you admit again and again
I can prove anything
The way that it's read again and again

And its only 'cause you came here with your brothers too
If you came here on your own you?d be dead
Its only 'cause you follow what the others do
Its no excuse to say your easily lead

You can choose anything
You choose to lose again and again
You could do anything
Why should you do anything again

And its only 'cause you came here with your brothers too
If you came here on your own you?d be dead
Winding yourself up until your turning blue
Repeating everything that you've read

So here we go with the letter
Well can you fix it for me
'Cause we need entertainment
To keep us all off the streets

So tonight you'll sleep softly in your bed

You can try anything
And no-one would know apart for you and me
You can stop anything
It's starts with just one and two then three

Its only 'cause you came here with your brothers too
If you came here on your own you?d be dead
Raise a glass or two
You raise a fist or two
And get a shopping basket wrapped round your head

Here we go with the letter
Oh can you fix it for me
Twenty four hour drinking
To keep us all off the streets

So tonight you'll sleep softly in your bed

We are the angry mob
We read the papers everyday day
We like who like
We hate who we hate
But we're also easily swayed
