I don't know why I've got it so bad
But somehow I got out of a fryn' pan
I'm in a new file where at it sooner
Buried with souls

I'm back in my head so I'm ready to go
Slipping and sliding, I'm out of control
Tryin' to hide my head in a hole
There's something about you I've gotta know
Before we go to far

But I wanna know, I wanna know
But I wanna know, what I wanna know is
Are, are you the one? Are you the one?
Are you the one? Are you the

Me and my girl havin' the time o'
Time of the world
But I've got a secret no one can know
If you wanna find out come to the show

We've got the music, you got to go
Temperature's hot, babe, it's ready to blow
Until she finds out all she knows
Something's said out loud in on the wall
Before she goes too far

But I wanna know
I wanna know but I wanna know
What I wanna know is
Are, are you the one? Are you the one?
Are you the one? Are you the

Creepin' around, cryin' darkness
Place to be found
Leave me behind the noise of the crowds
It's been a while since you've come around

So let's make it worth the lights to the sounds
Pills to the spills, drink to the shouts
Still tryin' to find out what it's all about
It's just one more thing, I've gotta find out
Before we go too far

But I wanna know, but I wanna Know
But I wanna know, what I wanna know is
Are, are you the one? Are you the one?
Are you the one? Are you the one?
Are you the one? Are you the one?
Are you the one? Are you the one? Are you the
