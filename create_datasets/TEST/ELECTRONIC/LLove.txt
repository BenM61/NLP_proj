1, 1, 2, 3 you know L-L-O-V-E?
Peeking through the window,
Tryna get a looksie, looksie.

4, 4, 5, 6 I know how to get my kicks.
You may think that this is live,
Waiting for the remix, remix.

Sometimes I don't have much to say
Words just get in the way
Feelings come from a place
Far away from your face.

Sometimes I just wanna sing softly
Sing softly...
Sing softly...
Sing.

Sing softly...
Sing softly...
Sing.

Hey, hey, you, you
One more time will get us through
Turn the clock so we don't see
Happy just to be

1, 1, 2, 3 you know L-L-O-V-E?
This rhythm is sublime
Is so unreal

Sometimes I don't have much to say
Words just get in the way
Feelings come from a place
Far away from your face.

Sometimes I just wanna sing softly
Sing softly...
Sing softly...
Sing.

Sing softly...
Sing softly...
Sing.
