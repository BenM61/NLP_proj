Hi!

It was the best of times
It was the worst of times
I had to kill the new sheriff in town
She was gonna try to keep me
You go-go down
You go-go down
In a dream you will never be down
Some how
Some how
Another way to make the picture clearer
Point a gun
At the mirror
Heart's so dark, make dirt look clean
So clean
So clean
Don't kick
Don't scream
But at the end
I can only be
No rhyme
No reason
Be not afraid
Be not afraid
Be not

You are my bitter rival
But I need you for survival
You are my bitter rival
But I need you for survival
You are my bitter rival
But I need you for survival
You are my bitter rival
But I need you for survival

It was the best of times
It was the worst of times

You go-go down
You go-go down
In a dream you will never be down
Some how
Some how
Lay a hand on me
Lay a hand on you
Lay a hand on me
Lay a hand
Heart's so dark, make dirt look clean
So clean
So clean
Convicts
Convicts
East to West
The answer is yes
No rhyme
No reason
Be not afraid
Be not afraid
Be not

You are my bitter rival
But I need you for survival
You are my bitter rival
But I need you for survival
You are my bitter rival
But I need you for survival
You are my bitter rival
