I went to party
The people were screaming
Oh yeah!
The people were dancing

Everybody laughing
I couldn't believe, I was so surprised
Everybody singing right before my eyes 
Simon Says, let's play it one more time

Simon Says, before we lose our minds
Simon Says, it's only just a game
Simon Says, let's do it all again. 
I didn't understand

I was so confused
Who was this Simon?
Who let him loose?
The party was rocking, so out of control

No way to stop it
No where to go
Simon Says, let's play it one more time? 
No, no, we won't go

We want to play
No, no we won't go
Until we play
Oh, oh, oh we want to play 

If you want to play
The rules you must obey 
Simon Says put your hands in the air
Simon Says like you just don't care

Simon Says let the girls sing YE-AH! YE-AH!
Simon Says let the boys sing YO-YO!
Simon Says everybody sing OH-EH OH-OH-EH-OH
Simon Says put your right foot out

Shake your body all about. You're out! 
Simon Says, let's play it one more time
Simon Says, before we lose our minds
Simon Says, it's only just a game

Simon Says, let's do it all again.
