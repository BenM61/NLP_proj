One, two, three, four 
Yeah, c'mon
Comin' on comin' on moving faster
Got to get this feeling out yeah!
Just enough fall again she was fire
Hot enough to burn you out yeah!

Alright
Wait for me darling I can't wait to see you
Everyone's losing their mind again, mind again

On again, off again, indecisive
Caught up in bold desire 

Yeah 
Fill me up in the cup you are lovely 
Paint the town the color money 

Alright
Wait for me darling, I can't wait to see you
Everyone's losing their mind again

Don't fall in love 
That's the line they will feed you
If I can't have you I'll be dead again 

Dead again

Alright!
Wait for me darlin'
