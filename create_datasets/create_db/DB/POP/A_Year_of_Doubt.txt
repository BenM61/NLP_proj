I wait behind the factory gates
For you to finish off your shift
Irate because your losing faith
Fortune is said to favor the brave

Are you bored or are you blind
Beware the contents of your mind

I wait to find a different race
If so then I will not compete
My pain is worth no more than yours
In time we'll give up on ourselves

A simple life is not an option
Try to define the word satisfaction

I wait behind the factory gates
For you to finish off your shift

Solitary confinement never sounded so good
You said you were speechless
God I wish you were

Too late to gather in the sails
Commit, or face a year of doubt
Stand up to what we both despise
In spite we find a friend

It never pays to be complacent
Nature will always choose a replacement

I wait behind the factory gates
For you to finish off your shift
Irate because your losing faith
Fortune is said to favor the brave

I wait behind the factory gates
For you to finish off your shift

Solitary confinement never sounded so good
You said you were speechless
God I wish you were

I wait behind the factory gates
For you to finish off your shift
I wait behind the factory gates
