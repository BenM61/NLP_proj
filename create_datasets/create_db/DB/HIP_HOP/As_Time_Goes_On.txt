And will we ever share? (will we ever share?)
Yow yow

You who seh rule de people
Say don't it so deceitful
Yes year to year it's clear to de youths dat yuh don't care
Top dollar all you wanna is thief it
Everybody know it ain't no secret
Ammunition and gun dat's all yuh really wanna share
I see di blood is on your hand
I see di youths don't understand
It's goin nowhere
Round and round in a circle
Politics tacticts nah go work cauh
Too much blood gotta spill pon earth
Man is dying everywhere

As time goes on
When will we live together?
Time goes on
And one seem so unclever
As time goes on
Will we ever get along?
When will we live as one as time goes on?
When will we ever care?

Everybody got good and evil
Tek a look inna yourself people
Positive, negative, which one will yuh manifest?
Everybody wah de same ting down deh
Nobody don't wanna live in a dismay
Everybody's fighting, to achieve their happiness
Some man wah rich and famous
Den dem get it switched and blame us
I wish dat those could see their emptiness
Round and round in a circle
Selfishness just nah go work cauh
Too much blood gotta spill pon earth
Man is dying everywhere

As time goes on
When will we live together?
Time goes on
When one seem so unclever
As time goes on
Will we ever get along?
When will we live as one as time goes on?
When will we ever care?

Will we ever care?

Blood's on de creeps

Will wi ever care about life?
When de blood is on your hand
And di youths don't understand

Round and round in a circle
Blood spilling just nah go work cauh
Too much man just a dead pon earth
Man is dying everywhere
