It's Hell down here
and we've got to make a change (x3)

Got to make it hard
It's hard to make it
It's hard to make it
Gettin' harder every day

It's Hell tryin to make it
When you're doin it by yourself
It's Hell payin taxes
When there's no money left
It's Hell givin up the best years
The best years of your soul
Payin bills from the day you're born, good God
Your body starts gettin old

Oh oh oh oh
it's Hell down here
And we've got to make a change

It's Hell tryin to do right
By everyone you know
No matter how hard you try lil bubba
They say that they need some more

It's Hell
It's Hell (Ain't it the truth)
when you don't have the shoes on your feet (Ain't it the truth)
when you don't have a job, and you got to steal ...(?)

It's Hell
It's Hell
It's Hell down here
and we've got to make a change
It's Hell down here
and we've got to ... Make a change!

Burn! (?)

It's Hell tryin to make it

Your body starts gettin old

It's Hell down here
