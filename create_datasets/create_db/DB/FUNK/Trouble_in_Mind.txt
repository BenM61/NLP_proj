Trouble in mind, yes I'm blue
But I won't be blue always,
Sun is gonna shine in my back door someday

Trouble in mind, yes, it's true
I have almost lost my mind
Never had so much trouble in my life before

And if it don't stop, I'm going right on down to the river
I'm going to take my easy chair
And if the blues don't get me
I'm going to rock on away from here

Talking 'bout, I'm, trouble in mind, oh yes, I'm blue
I have almost lost my mind
Never had so much trouble in my life before

Now if it don't stop, I'm going right on down, ooh, to the river
I'm going to take my easy chair
And if the blues don't get me
I'm going to rock right on away from here

You better believe that, ah, trouble in mind, oh yes it's true
I have almost lost my mind, never had so much trouble
In my young life before

If it don't stop, I'm going right on down, ooh, to the river
I'm going to take my old easy chair
And if the blues don't get me, I might have to to rock on away from here

Say that, I've trouble in mind, oh yes I'm blue
But I just refuse to be blue always
The sun is gonna shine in my back door some day
I said it is and I know it is
Sun is gonna shine in my back door some day
When I said that I believe the sun is gonna shine in my back door some day
Oh, trouble in mind
