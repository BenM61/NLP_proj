I have a little red rooster
Too lazy to crow for day
I have a little red rooster
Too lazy to crow for day
Keep everything in the barnyard
Upset in every way

Oh, the dogs begin to bark and the
Hound begin to howl
Oh, the dogs begin to bark
Hound begin to howl
Oh, watch out, strange-kin people 'cause the
Little red rooster is on the prowl

If you see my little red rooster
Please drag him home
If you see my little red rooster
Please drag him home
There's been no peace in the barnyard
Since the little red rooster been gone
