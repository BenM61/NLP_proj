The flight of the finch it can be lonely
I don't expect for you to understand
He's got no use for words
He's the weakest of the birds
And when he spreads his wings
You watch him span

Well I can tell in your words that your sincere
I'm telling you what you don't wanna hear
But like the finches in the story
I'll be there when I'm lonely
But don't expect for me to stick around

The flight of the finch
Ooh the weakest of the birds
The flight of the finch
Ooh the weakest of the birds

Well I can tell in your words that your sincere
I'm telling you what you don't want to hear
But like the finches in the story,
Ill be there when I'm lonely
But don't expect for me to stick around

The flight of the finch
Ooh the weakest of the birds
The flight of the finch
Ooh the weakest of the birds

The flight of the finch

Oooh-ohh
