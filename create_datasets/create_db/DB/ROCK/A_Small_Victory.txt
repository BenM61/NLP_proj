A hierarchy
Spread out on the nightstand
The spirit of team
Salvation is another chance
A sore loser
Yelling with my mouth shut
A cracking portrait
The fondling of trophies
The null of losing
Can you afford that luxury?
A sore winner
But I'll just keep my mouth shut
It shouldn't bother me
It shouldn't bother me
It shouldn't bother me
It shouldn't but it does
The small victories
The cankers and medallions
The lips on my face
They keep me thinking, that someday
I might beat you
But I'll just keep my mouth shut
It shouldn't bother me (no)
It shouldn't bother me (no,no)
It shouldn't bother me
It shouldn't but it does

It shouldn't bother me (no, no)
It shouldn't bother me
It shouldn't bother me
It shouldn't bother me

If I speak at one constant volume
At one constant pitch
At one constant rhythm right into your ear, you still won't hear
You still won't hear
You still won't hear
You still won't hear
You still won't hear
You still won't hear
You still won't hear
You still won't hear
You still won't hear
You still won't hear
You still won't hear
