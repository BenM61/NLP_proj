I'm with you, you're with me
This is reality
We're together like never before
And now I want you more
Heaven must have sent you
So perfect your love

Come to me don't be afraid of this love
Never let go
In my heart you're everything
That I need to survive
You keep me so alive

Your love's so precious
Like a diamond in the rain that drops
On the window pane
Your love's so precious
Nothing in the world could ever take me away

You're the love of my life
I'm gonna do you right 
'Cause you possess a heart of gold
You're so beautiful
These feelings that you give me
I'll keep forever

Come to me don't be afraid of this love
Never let go
In my heart you're everything
That I need to survive
You keep me so alive

Your love's so precious
Like a diamond in the rain that drops
On the window pane
Your love's so precious
Nothing in the world could ever take me away
