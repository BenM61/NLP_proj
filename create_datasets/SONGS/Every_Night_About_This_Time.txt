Every night about this time
She's waiting for a man
It could be me or it could be you
Who'll touch her with their hands
Someone left her long ago
She never found out why
So she falls in love again
Every night about this time

Every night about this time
She'll be holding someone tight
Faces don't mean much
When she turns out the lights
Just tell her that you love her
Even though she knows you're lying
Then she'll lead you to her room
Every night about this time

Every night about this time
She could be yours
She could be mine
Just hold her when she cries
Every night about this time

Every night about this time
She'll pretend the best she can
It could be me or it could be you
Who'll remind her of a man
Don't say nothing when you leave
No need for long good-byes
You're not the one she's missing
Every night about this time

Every night about this time
She could be yours
She could be mine
Just hold her when she cries
Every night about this time
