In the midst of all my darkness, baby
You came along to guide me
You took pity on a lonely man
When you said you'd stand beside me
I'll never forget you
Or what you've done
I'll never turnt my back on you for anyone

I've got so much love to give you
Baby, I've got so much love to give you
Girl, there's more than enough to last a whole life through
And it's all for you

My world was cold and empty
And my life was so unfilled
When I needed someone to pick me up
You were oh so willing
Now to you it might seem like a little thing
But to me it was like changin' my winter to spring

I've got so much love to give you
Baby, I've got so much love to give you
Girl, there's more than enough to last a whole life through
And it's all for you

There's so few women now a days
Who understand the soul of a man
They're always on the talking end
Never giving, never offering a helping hand
But baby, I can count on you
Whenever trouble calls
You see me through 
You show your love in so many ways
And I'm gonna love you for the rest of my days

I've got so much love to give you
Baby, I've got so much love to give you
Girl, there's more than enough to last a whole life through
And it's all for you
