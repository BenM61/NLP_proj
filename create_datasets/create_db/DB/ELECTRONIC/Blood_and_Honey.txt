Midnight in the city and everyone's asleep
See the shadow walking in the dark
Here she comes
She's all in black

Long hair flowing down her back
Gotta get her out of my mind.
Honey
I want to kiss you
Honey
Give me your head
Honey
I want to kiss you
Baby

Let me waste away upon your tender lips
Oh
She loves blood and honey

She's got the devil in her eyes
(She's got the devil in her eyes)
She loves blood and honey
They say nobody survives a deadly kiss

Oh
She loves blood and honey
She's got the devil in her eyes
(She's got the devil in her eyes)
She loves blood and honey
Devil is her love and it's the kiss of death to love he

Now she's lonely walking down your street
She's looking for a bite to eat
When she loves she really leaves her mark

Pain in her eyes and death in her smile:
It'sSa one-way-trip to hell!
Give in to desire and she'll put your soul on fire
Velvety eyes and pearly skin
When she'll knock at your door
Your night will begin

Oh
I want to kiss you
Baby

I want to honey
I want to kiss you
Baby
Got to kill the lady who loves blood and honey.
Oh
Sheloves blood and honey

She loves blood and honey

Honey
I want to kiss you
Honey
Give me your head

Oh
She loves blooa and honey
