I met my girl on a mountain side
Looking for warmth and a place to hide
She took me in as the day grew long
As we lay by the fire our love grew strong

I left the city for its dirt and grime
The factory walls to make mountain time
I found love, but she slipped away
Now I'm alone, but here I'll stay

I keep on looking till this very day
For my baby...my baby...(so far)...who's gone away
I'll search... search this land till my dyin' day
A sweet loving woman, make a mountain
Make a mountain
Cry
Cry
Make a mountain
Cry
Mountain cry
Make a mountain (mountain cry)
Come on baby
Mountain cry
Mountain cry
Mountain...mountain...
Make a mountain cry
