Cutting razors and violence
Recalling cutthroats razor sin
We're watching heaven as the sun goes down
I watch the sun burst it hits the ground
You've gone too far
Dawnrazor's falling brush their skin
Dawnrazor's falling brush their skin

Dawnrazor
Dawnrazor well now
Dawnrazor
Dawnrazor well now

Only dreams survive
Been lost before
Only dreams survive
Been cut before

Cutting razors and violence
Recalling cutthroats razor sin
You've gone to far
Dawnrazor's falling brush their skin
Dawnrazor's falling brush their skin
Dawnrazor's falling brush their skin
Our dark angel has fallen brush their skin
