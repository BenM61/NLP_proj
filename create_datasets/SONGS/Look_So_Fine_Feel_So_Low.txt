I've been seen on the street
Wearing brand new clothes
I guess I've landed on my feet
I'm a lucky guy I suppose 

She tells me that she loves me
She buys me things
She wants to take care of me
And all I gotta do is sing sing sing sing 

Well I look so fine but I feel so low 

She takes me by the arm
She takes me all around
She knows all her friends are talking
Saying look what our good girl's found 

One thing she's got on you
She's so easy to impress
When she asks me dumb questions
All I gotta do is say yes yes yes yes 

Yeah I look so fine but I feel so low
