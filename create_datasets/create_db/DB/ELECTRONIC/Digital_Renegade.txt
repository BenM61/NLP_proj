I'm seeing clear, I'm leaving fear
For the first time in my life,
I'll take everything I know
To the streets, to the people

Trying hard to feel something real
We've had enough, this is reality
It's not enough, to keep this feeling alive

Trying hard to feel something real
We've had enough, but this is reality
It's not enough, not enough
To keep this feeling alive

The truth, we want it now, we want it right now
(The truth, we want it now, we want it right now)
The truth, we want it now, we want it right now

We did nothing wrong
Life's long enough, they'll find me
My home was here all along
I just needed a dose of reality

I'm seeing clear, I'm leaving fear
For the first time in my life,
I'll take everything I know
To the streets, to the people
I'm seeing clear, I'm leaving fear
For the first time in my life,
I'll take everything I know
To the streets, to the people

Trying hard to feel something real
We've had enough, but this is reality
It's not enough, not enough
To keep this feeling alive

We did nothing wrong
Life's long enough, they'll find me

The truth, we want it now, we want it right now
(The truth, we want it now, we want it right now)
The truth, we want it now, we want it right now

This is reality, yeah!
