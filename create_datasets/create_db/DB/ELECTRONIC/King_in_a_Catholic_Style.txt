Wake up, wake up
King in a catholic style
With your man
With your man make up
And your big money business smile

Cut 'em up, cut 'em up
Crucial to every child
With a mind
With a mind made up
And your main man confidence smile

The residential black sea band
They rose up out of a sinking sand
The presidential elect man said
For what you want take me instead

Wake up, wake up
Exercise your every right
With your plan
On the up and up
And your prize money struggle in sight

Cut 'em up, cut 'em up
Physical in every way
Tough enough, tough enough
Face up
And blow your big body blues away
