And so I landed here on another planet
By now it seems it might have happened to me
Everybody here looking at me weird, so I wondered
And so I wondered and wandered around the planet
Looking for some things that might have mattered to me
Everything here looks to me to be:
All in order
All in order it seems to be

'Till cautiously, I go
Around the corner where nothing will grow without a
Kind of water that they don't know about
The Plants think the animals are ruining everything
Everything here looks to me to be:
All in order
All in order, I go
