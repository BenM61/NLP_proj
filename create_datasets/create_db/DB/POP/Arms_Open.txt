I can't unfeel your pain
I can't undo what's done
I can't send back the rain
But if I could I would
My love, my arms are open

So when you feel like you can't take another round of being broken
My arms are open
And when you're losing faith and every door around you keeps on closing
My arms are open

I can't uncry your tears
I can't rewind the time
I can't unsay what's said
In your crazy life
My love, my arms are open

Oh, and when you're cursing at the sky
And thinking, "lord, you must be joking"
My arms are open
And, and when you're looking in the mirror
Thinking that, "my life is over"
My arms are open

My arms are open (oh, oh)
My arms are open (oh, oh)
My arms are open (oh, oh)
My arms are open (oh, oh)

So what did they do to you?
Are you always done for me?
And let me be the ground
Underneath your feet

I can't unfeel your pain
I can't undo what's done
I can't send back the rain
But if I could I would
My love, my arms are open, arms are open

So when you feel like you can't take another round of being broken
My arms are open
Oh, and when you're losing faith and every door around you keeps on closing
My arms are open

My arms are open (oh, oh)
My arms are open (oh, oh)
My arms are open (oh, oh)
My arms are open (oh, oh)

(My arms are open)
I will be standing here
I will be by your side (my arms are open)
You see me loud and clear
With my arms open wide (my arms are open)
I will be standing here
I will be by your side (my arms are open)
You see me loud and clear
With my arms open wide

My arms are open
