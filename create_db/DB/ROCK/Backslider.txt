Bended knee
Nine years old
Waitin' for
Just one word!

I was thinkin' of all the things
My daddy told me of
Sin and salvation and
Manhood and dignity

All that time
In the dark
Just one word
Backslider!

I remember the day I stepped
Into the water
My daddy held me in his hands
And pushed my head under
And said

Son I am
So proud.
Just one word
Backslider!

Well I opened my eyes
And my daddy held me in his hands
I looked up through the water
And thought I saw Jesus, and then

Well I threw up my hands!
And I heard, Amen!
And I prayed, sweet Jesus
Don't let me become a backslider!
