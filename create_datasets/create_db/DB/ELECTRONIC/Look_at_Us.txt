For all the times that we, we ever were to be
Look at us baby, look at us now
For every day that I should have you by my side
We'll make it baby, look at us now

For every night I pray I know that you will stay
Look at us baby, look at us now
Remembering the time our love was not so fine
We made it baby, look at us now, baby look at us

Everybody believed we would never be
Look at us up above, we are so in love
Everyday in your arms, baby, can't go wrong
We are strong, look at us now

For all the times that we, we ever were to be
Look at us baby, look at us now
For every day that I should have you by my side
We'll make it baby, look at us now

For every night I pray I know that you will stay
Look at us baby, look at us now
Remembering the time our love was not so fine
We made it baby, look at us now, baby look at us
Baby look at us
Baby look at us
Baby look at us

Everybody believed we would never be
Look at us up above, we are so in love
Everyday in your arms, baby, can't go wrong
We are strong, look at us now

For every night I dream, together you and me
Look at us baby, look at us now
And like a flower blooms, the glowing of the moon
We'll make it baby, look at us now

Though everyone believe that we could never be
Look at us baby, look at us now
Now all the hurt is gone, I knew it all along
We'd make it baby, look at us now

Baby look at us
Baby look at us
Baby look at us
Baby look at us
Baby look at us

For every night I dream
Baby look at us
For every night I dream
Baby look at us
For every night I dream
Baby look at us
For every night
Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, 
Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, 
Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, 
Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream,
Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream (fade)

For every night I dream, the more I do believe
Look at us baby, look at us now
A bird up in the sky, our love will not deny
We'll make it baby, look at us now

In all you ever do, I know you will be true
Look at us baby, look at us now
A story of our kind, these ones that never die
We'll make it baby, look at us now
Baby look at us 

For all the times that we, we ever were to be
Look at us baby, look at us now
For every day that I should have you by my side
We'll make it baby, look at us now

For every night I pray I know that you will stay
Look at us baby, look at us now
Remembering the time our love was not so fine
We made it baby, look at us now, baby look at us
