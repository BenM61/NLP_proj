Is it real, what I feel, is it love,
Is it love that's making me weak, in the night,
And when she's next to me,
I just stumble on my words,
And all the things I want to say,
Come out wrong,
I am lost in a dream,
But I know this is more than it seems,
I need a little help;

Someone put on a love song,
To bring her closer to me,
All I want is this diamond in the dark,
To begin what must be;

When she turns at her name, when she smiles,
When she smiles, I feel it again, in my heart,
Across the crowded room,
She is just a dance away,
And I can feel her like a fire that's burning strong,
She keeps looking at me,
And I know this was all meant to be,
And then it had to come;

Someone put on a love song,
To bring her closer to me,
All I want is this diamond in the dark,
To begin what must be,
All I want is this diamond in the dark,
To begin what must be,
All I want is this diamond in the dark, to begin what must be,
All I want is this diamond in the dark, to begin what must be.
