There at the window you're standing in the dark
Come turn on the light
You know I'm out there scratching like a dog
Prowling in the night

You know I'm waiting
You know what for
If you keep me waiting babe
I won't just be knocking anymore

I'm gonna bang down the door to your love
I'd love to make it easy but you make me play rough
Bang down the door to your love
Why do you want to make me want to
Bang down the door to your love

Out in the shadows
Locked out in the cold
I should turn and walk away
My instincts tell me ooh I can feel it
That you want me to stay

You hear me calling and you know why
You think you'll stop me but
No matter how hard you try

What kind of trick are you playing on me
Don't push me further in my fantasy
I'm gonna lose my self control
You've got to give me more
Or I'll bang down the door
To your love

I'm gonna bang down the door to your love
I'd love to make it easy but you make me play rough
Bang down the door to your love
Why do you want to make me want to
Bang down the door to your love

Bang down the door to your love
Bang down the door
Bang down the door to your love
