And I saw a burning chariot,
And the four horsemen of the apocalypse,
Waiting on high,
And I heard the thunder rolling in,
And behold our leader on a pale horse riding in the sky;

And I saw this land a battlefield,
With a hundred thousand men,
Fighting hand to hand,
And I heard the sounds of victory,
And the rivers ran red with the blood of our enemies;

And I, I saw fire from the sky,
I saw fire, and I saw paradise, (paradise,)
Fire from the sun, I saw fire,
And I saw Alpha and Omega;

Fire, I saw fire,
And I saw paradise, (paradise,)
Fire, I saw fire;
