Well, you know you're gonna have to steal it,
If you want your cake and eat it, too
There is no one less believin',
Than the guy who's been deceiving you

You got to pay the piper,
In the end you will be so much wiser
Got to use your best endeavor,
When you're kissing to be clever

'Cause it's a hard, hard lesson,
That you're gonna learn,
On the river of no return

You been burnin' all your bridges,
Like a child with forty wishes,
On the river of no return

Well, you got your finger,
On the trigger,
It would help if you was-a bigger
Now, it's not easy, I know, it's not easy

'Cause it's a hard, hard lesson,
That you're gonna learn,
On the river of no return

Yes, you have done your share of cheatin',
Now you're gonna have to take a beatin'
You been acting like a sucker
Now, you're gonna have to suffer, yeah

'Cause it's a hard, hard lesson,
That you're gonna learn,
On the river of no return

Say, say, say
It's a hard, hard, lesson,
That you're gonna learn,
On the river of no return

It's a one way to go,
It's on and on you go
On the river of no return.

Say it again!
It's a hard, hard lesson,
That you're gonna learn,
On the river of no return

Got swept out in the tide,
With no one on your side,
On the river of no return
