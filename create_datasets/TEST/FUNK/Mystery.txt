Turning back the hands of time
Holding on to misty memories
Chasing shadows throught the night
Trying to find my happy ending

Reaching out for another chance at heaven
We could still find a way if we try

Baby, believe in the myster
Like it used to be
We were more than lonely drifters in the dark
I can remember the sun inside
Love held us tight
I need to feel your magic in my heart
Instead of it tearing apart

Diamonds shining in the night
Lying soft and warm together
Only images survive
Can't my dreams go on forever

Oh there's still time to lock away your sadness
Let the secrets of love start to smile

Baby, believe in the myster
Like it used to be
We were more than lonely drifters in the dark
I can remember the sun inside
Love held us tight
I need to feel your magic in my heart
Instead of it tearing apart
Baby believe in the mystery
Like it used to be
Baby bring back all the passion to my heart
I can remember the tender days, all the love we made
Can't you see in me your magic here tonight

Lonely spirits seem to whisper in the wind
It's a silent song that's never meant to be 
Since the dawn of time the mystery never ends
We could find forever if we let love rise again

Tell me shy can't we reach for another chance at heaven
We can still find the way if you try

Baby, believe in the myster
Like it used to be
We were more than lonely drifters in the dark
I can remember the sun inside
Love held us tight
I need to feel your magic in my heart
Instead of it tearing apart
Baby believe in the mystery
Like it used to be
Baby bring back all the passion to my heart
I can remember the tender days, all the love we made
I need to feel your magic here tonight
