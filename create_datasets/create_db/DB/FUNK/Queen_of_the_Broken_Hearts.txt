Both sides are fightin'
You don't know who to choose
You're stuck in the middle
And you can't lose
Both sides are talkin'
You've finally seen the light
You'll get it together
But not tonight

You were born with it
And now you got it
The way you want it
And you don't care
Cause nothin's gonna bring you down

You were born with it
And now you got it
And oooh you flaunt it
And you don't care
'Cause nothin's gonna bring you down,
No

But she's not that kind of girl
I'm tellin' all the world
She was born the Queen of the Broken Hearts

She says she'll write you letters
But that ain't face to face
She'll give you a number
But it's not her place...oh
Don't keep her waiting
Now see what you have done
You look in the mirror
It ain't no fun

You were born with it
And now you got it
The way you want it
And you don't care
Cause nothin's gonna bring you down,
No

You were born with it
And now you got it
And oh you flaunt it
And you don't care
'Cause nothin's gonna bring you down,
No

But she's not that kind of girl
I'm tellin' all the world
She was born the Queen of the Broken Hearts

'Cause she's not that kind of girl
I'm tellin' all the world
She was born the Queen of the Broken Hearts

'Cause she's not that kind of girl
I'm tellin' all the world
She was born the Queen of the Broken Hearts
She was born the Queen of the Broken Hearts
She was born the Queen of the Broken Hearts

Yeah, yeah, yeah
