I don't want to love you
But I do and I just can't help it

You bring me happiness and then pain
Are these nights I spend
Crying over you really worth it, really worth it?
Or am I shedding tears in vain

You know every girl has to have
Someone she can depend on
Someone to trust in and I depend on you day by day
It's always been that way

When you kiss me tears of joy I shed
Makes me wonder, makes me wonder
Wonder am I shedding tears in vain

Darling, I wonder
Are all these tears in vain
