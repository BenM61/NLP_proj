Once upon a time science opened up the door
We would feed the hungry fields till they couldn't eat no more
But the potions that we made touched the creatures down below, oh
And they grew up in the way that we'd never seen before

Supernature, supernature
Supernature, supernature
Supernature, supernature
Supernature, supernature

They were angry with the man 'cause he changed their way of life
And they take their sweet revenge, as they trample through the night
For a hundred miles or more you can hear the people cry
But there's nothin' you can do even God is on their side

Supernature, supernature
Supernature, supernature
Supernature, supernature
Supernature, supernature

How can I explain, things are different today
Darkness all around and nobody makes a sound
Such a sad affair, no one seems to care

Supernature, better watch out
Look at you now, better watch out
Look at you now, supernature

Better watch out, there's no way to stop it now
You can't escape, it's too late
Look what you've done, there's no place that you can run
The monster's made, we must pay

Supernature, you better watch out
Supernature, look at you now
Supernature, you better watch out
Supernature, look at you now

Better watch out, there's no way to stop it now
You can't escape, it's too late
(Supernature)
Look what you've done, there's no place that you can run
The monster's made, we must pay

Maybe nature has a plan to control the ways of man
He must start from scratch again many battles he must win
Till he earns his place on earth like the other creatures do
Will there be a happy end, now that all depends on you

Supernature, supernature
Supernature, supernature
Supernature
