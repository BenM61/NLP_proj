I had to clear my mind 'cause they're envious
You know that some things just don't change
Started rumors, spread lies about me
Tried to decompose my name

See, the shady sisters they be watchin me
I got shady n****s gettin next to me
Try to get some of this, see what I'm about
Thinkin I'm an easy prey and they can dog me out

But I tells them no
I'm trying to be all I can be
It's kind of funny 'cause they keep on
Talkin trash about me
They know nothin bout me
So tell me why

Why is everybody so envious
You know that envy never dies
Need to raise up off of me and worry 'bout yourself
Not the way I live my life (Oh)

Why is everybody so envious

See, they envious about the moves I make
I ain't afraid to take a chance
See, they envious because I can't just stop
Even envious about my man

While they're busy talkin', I just keep on walkin'
'Cause it doesn't mean a thing
See, your sticks and stones they may break my bones
But the words will never hurt me

'Cause I let it go

It's kind of funny 'cause they keep on
Talkin' trash about me
They know nothin' 'bout me
Tell me why
