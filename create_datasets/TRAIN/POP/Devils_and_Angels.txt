There's a devil in my head
An angel in my bed that's getting colder
I'm trying to warm it up with the only way I know
There's something hid inside...I think that I should tell her
Cause its about that time I let her know

He says come with me I'll show you my way
Into a place where all the devils go

Days and days go by that I tell myself the lie I'm getting older
I need to slow it down but the way I don't know
And the devil inside is telling me an order
"To ever feel alive I've got to let her go"

He says come with me I'll show you my way
Into a place where all the devils go
No more pain no more lies and no more worries
It's a place where all the devils go

And I feel cold and so alone
Cause I don't know which way to turn
And I feel like I'm getting weaker 
Cause I can't ever take control
(Cant ever take control)
Ohhh Devil in my head an angel in my bed that's getting colder
I cannot I will not let her go

She says come with me I'll show you my way
To a place where all the angels go
No more pain no more lies and no more worries
It's a place where all true lovers go
She says come with me I'll show you my way
To a place where all the angels go
