People say I'm the life of the party
'Cause I tell a joke or two
Although I might be laughing loud and hearty
Deep inside I'm blue

So take a good look at my face
You see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears

I need you (Need you)

I need you (Need you)

If you see me with another girl
Acting like I'm having fun
Uh now she may be cute but she's a substitute
Because, girl, you're the permanent one

Well, take a good look at my face
You see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears

Outside I'm masquerading
Inside my hope is fading
Just a clown since you put me down
My smile is my make up
I wear since my break-up with you

Baby, baby take a good look at my face
You see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears

Baby, baby, baby take a good look at my face
You know my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
