I never thought I'd feel this
Guilty and broken down inside
Living with myself, nothing but lies

I always thought I'd make it
But never knew I'd let it get so bad
Living with myself is all I have

I feel numb
I can't come to life
I feel like I'm frozen in time

Living in a world so cold, wasting away
Living in a shell with no soul, since you've gone away
Living in a world so cold, counting the days
Since you've gone away
You've gone away

Do you ever feel me?
Do you ever look deep down inside
Staring at yourself, paralyzed?

I feel numb
I can't come to life
I feel like I'm frozen in time

Living in a world so cold, wasting away
Living in a shell with no soul, since you've gone away
Living in a world so cold, counting the days
Since you've gone away
You've gone away

From me

I'm too young (I'm too young)
To lose my soul
I'm too young (I'm too young)
To feel this old
So long (so long)
I'm left behind
I feel like I'm losing my mind

Do you ever feel me?
Do you ever look deep down inside
Staring at your life, paralyzed?

Living in a world so cold, wasting away
Living in a shell with no soul, since you've gone away
Living in a world so cold, counting the days
Since you've gone away
You've gone away

From me

I'm too young, (I'm too young)
I'm too young, (I'm too young)
