Tonight I celebrate my love for you
It seems like the natural thing to do
Tonight no one's gonna find us
We'll leave the world behind us
When I make love to you
Tonight I celebrate my love for you

And I hope that deep inside you feel it too
Tonight our spirits will be climbing
To a sky lit with diamonds
When I make love to you tonight

Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And that midnight sun 
Is gonna come shining through
Tonight there'll be no distance between us
What I want most to do 
Is to make love to you tonight

Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And soon this old world will feel brand new
Tonight we will both discover 
How friends turn into lovers
When I make love to you

Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And that midnight sun 
Is gonna come shining through
Tonight there'll be no distance between us
What I want most to do 
Is to make love to you

Tonight I celebrate my love for you
Tonight I celebrate my love for you
