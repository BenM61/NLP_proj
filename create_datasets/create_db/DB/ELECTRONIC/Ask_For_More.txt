I feel you
I hold you
I taste you
As you travel
Deep into my senses
So refreshing

Soon you will open up the door
Feel my eternal love
So pour yourself right into me
Too much is never enough

I love love
You need love
Don't be afraid
Just ask for more

I need love
You have love
Don't be afraid
Just ask for more

Come feel love
Come taste love
Just ask for more

Give the love a chance to speak to you
And it's voice will bring passion
As I taste it
In your silence

I feel the love
When we're having fun
So pour yourself right into me
Too much is never enough

I love love
You need love
Don't be afraid
Just ask for more

I need love
You have love
Don't be afraid
Just ask for more

You deserve love
Touch this love
Don't be afraid
Just ask for more

Come feel love
Come taste love
Just ask for more
