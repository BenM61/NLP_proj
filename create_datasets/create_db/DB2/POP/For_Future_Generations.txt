The signs are obvious, they are everywhere 
All that we hear about is the gloom and despair Too many would be prophets sayin' 
"It's the end of it all" 
'Cause mother earth can't take much more 
The hammer's gonna fall

So nature has its needs, 
that's a lesson learned 
But it appears to me 
there are greater concerns 
'Cause we can save the planet 
Thinkin' we will somehow survive 
But father time is calling us 
To save somebody's life, so

I won't bend and I won't break 
I won't water down my faith 
I won't compromise in a world of desperation 
What has been I cannot change 
But for tomorrow and today 
I must be a light for future generations

If we could find a way to 
preserve our faith 
So those who follow us 
See the price that was paid 
Then maybe when they question 
What it's gonna take to survive 
They'll find the strength to carry on 
In what we leave behind

I won't bend and I won't break 
I won't water down my faith 
I won't compromise in a world of desperation 
What has been I cannot change 
But for tomorrow and today 
I must be a light for future generations

Lookin' in the eyes of the children 
Knowing that tomorrow is at stake 
When the choice is up to them 
Will they have the strength to say

We won't bend and we won't break 
we won't water down our faith 
We won't compromise in a world of desperation 
What has been we cannot change 
But for tomorrow and today 
We must be a light for future generations

I won't bend and I won't break 
I won't water down my faith 
I won't compromise in a world of desperation 
What has been I cannot change 
But for tomorrow and today 
I must be a light for future generations
