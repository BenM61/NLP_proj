Is this the way I wanna live?
Trying hard not to miss anything life might give
Or do I keep on running round?
Chasing my tail, never exhale
How come I never settle down?

Will I ever rest my head?
At ease, at peace
And in need of nothing else

I ask of you

If only fools are satisfied
Take my sanity away
If only fools, fools are satisfied
Take my sanity away

If only fools are satisfied
Take my sanity away

When will I ever lose this drive?
I try but I never seem to win this fight
I'm like a house without a soul
The emptiness keeps me going
Maybe you can make me whole
And sooth my head
At ease, at peace
And in need of nothing else

I ask of you

If only fools are satisfied
Take my sanity away
If only fools, fools are satisfied
Take my sanity away

If only fools are satisfied
Take my sanity away
