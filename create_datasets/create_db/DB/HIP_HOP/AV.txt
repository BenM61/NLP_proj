This girl was so fine, much more than two guns
I had to pump my brakes man she
Looked like no other kind, you can see in your mind
I had to take this one with me
Now, could you imagine like everything you want
Every piece of your fantasy was just like a dream come true
One thing for me to do I had to get this girl

Girl you know I see in your eye
I'm checking you, you're checkin' me
We both can see it's meant to be
Come chill with your man AV
Let's spend some time, sip on some wine
Baby relax let's take our time
We both can see it's meant to be
Come chill wit ya man AV

You know there's no limit to things that I wanna do
I'll make your every dream come true
Tickets first class for two, penthouse with ocean views
Now feel me while I set the mood
Dinner by the candle light girl, get cha mind right
And damn you are the sexy type, baby girl I got plans for you
Disregard all the rules tonight I'm getting into you

First I'm gonna work ya body from the top
Get around the middle baby I won't stop
Then I'll keep it movin' till I find the spot
Temperature is rising girl, it's so so hot

Girl you know I see in your eye
I'm checking you, you're checkin' me
We both can see it's meant to be
Come chill with your man AV
Let's spend some time, sip on some wine
Baby relax, let's take our time
We both can see it's meant to be
Come chill wit ya man AV

And now the back bone slippin' and the hands are girppin'
And the sheets is drippin' and the body's flippin', yes
This is a piece I can't give ya too much
It's an example of makin' good love
And the walls is shakin' and the bed is breakin'
And the lips is movin' and the hips is groovin', yes
And I got the protection for this type of affection
When you're pitting your best in there ain't no time for restrain

Girl you know I see in your eye
I'm checking you, you're checkin' me
We both can see it's meant to be
Come chill with your man AV
Let's spend some time, sip on some wine
Baby relax, let's take our time
We both can see it's meant to be
Come chill wit ya man AV

So lock all the doors
[Incomprehensible] the phone
I'm happy nobody's here, we're all alone
I'm gonna keep DJ
[Incomprehensible] goes to me
I've come in the way, you twist your body for me

So lock all the doors
[Incomprehensible] the phone
I'm happy nobody's here, we're all alone
I'm gonna keep DJ
[Incomprehensible] goes to me
