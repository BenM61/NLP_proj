Cold as ice
And more bitter than a December
Winter night
That's how I treated you
And I know that I
I sometimes tend to loose my temper
And I cross the line
Yeah that's the truth

I know it gets hard sometimes
But I could never
Leave your side
No matter what I say
'Cause if I wanted to go
I would've gone by now but
I really need you near me
To keep my mind off the edge
If I wanted to leave
I would've left by now
But you're the only one that knows me
Better than I know myself

All along
I tried to pretend it didn't matter
If I was alone
Deep down I know
If you were gone
For even a day I wouldn't know which way to turn
'Cause I'm lost without you

I know it gets hard sometimes
But I could never
Leave your side
No matter what I say

'Cause if I wanted to go
I would've gone by now
But I really need you near me
To keep my mind off the edge
If I wanted to leave
I would've left by now
But you're the only one that knows me
Better than I know myself

I get kind of dark
Let it go to far
I can be obnoxious at times
But try and see my heart
'Cause I need you now
So don't let me down
You are the only thing in this world
I would die without

'Cause if I wanted to go
I would've gone by now but
I really need you near me
To keep my mind off the edge
If I wanted to leave
I would've left by now
But you're the only one that knows me
Better than I know myself

'Cause if I wanted to go
I would've gone by now but
I really need you near me
To keep my mind off the edge
If I wanted to leave
I would've left by now
But you're the only one that knows me
Better than I know my self
