So bang the drum all night
You left your soul beside
Don't let them in
Don't let your feelings shine
It'll be alright, alright

And I try too hard
And I try too hard

Pray to your shrine all night
You left your shoes beside
Don't breathe it in
The thought is in disguise
It'll be alright, alright

And I try too hard
And I try too hard

Life will be the same
I'm sure you're on your own
And I try too hard
Life will be the same
I'm sure of who you are

And I try too hard

Life will be the same 
I'm sure you're on your own
And I try too hard
Life will be the same
I'm sure of who you are
And I try too hard
Life will be the same
I'm sure you're on your own
And I try too hard
Ahhhhhhh
