The moon shook and curled up like gentle fire
The ocean glazed and melted wire
Voices buzzed in spiral eyes
Stars dived in blinding skies

Stars die, blinding skies

Tree cracked and mountain cried
Bridges broke, window sighed
Cells grew up and rivers burst
Sound obscured and sense reversed

Stars die, blinding skies

Hello Neil and Buzz, 
I am talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House
and this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made
I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you have done
For every American this has to be the proudest day of our lives
Because of what you have done the heavens have become a part of man's world
and as you talk to us from the sea of tranquility
it inspires us to redouble our efforts 
to bring peace and tranquility to earth

Idle mind and severed soul
Silent nerves and begging bowl
Shallow haze to blast a way
Hyper sleep to end the day
