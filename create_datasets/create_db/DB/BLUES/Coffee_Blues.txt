Mama got mad at Papa
'Cause he didn't bring no coffee home
Mama got mad at Papa
'Cause he didn't bring no coffee home
She begin to wonder what is going on wrong

Papa said, "Mama, I ain't mad with you
Now don't you get mad with me
Baby, I ain't mad with you
Now don't you get mad with me"

Papa's been teasing mama
'Cause she said, "I ain't mad with you"
Papa's been teasing mama
'Cause she said, "I ain't mad with you"

She said,"Every thing's all right
Don't make no difference what you do"
You know Papa got good with Mama somehow

And I was crying for bread, and yes, I
Baby, I was crying for bread
And these are the words I said
Now look at mama, just trying to shout

It was early one evening
But Papa came home late at night
It was early one evening
But Papa came home late at night
That's when Mama was mad and hurt
And Papa began to fight
