I can see a time when I won't be able to feel the time no more, 
and I can leave this town for other shores. 
'cause I could never make it last or ever understand
what you'd keep me for when I turn evil in your hands.

Saying all they have is drawn from memory, 
I've got you and tomorrow.
You can steal the scene but you're blind
and the magic will leave you feeling hollow.

The girl that I could never hurt had to go and lose all that power over me,
and I claimed victory.

Saying all they have is drawn from memory, I've got you and tomorrow. 
You can steal the scene bit you're blind and the magic will leave you feeling hollow.

So innocent, that sweet look in your eyes,
no hate nor fear could open.
You blessed a part of me without knowing.
And it strikes me that I could cry
and the thought of me crying will start me laughing.
You blessed a part of me without lying.
