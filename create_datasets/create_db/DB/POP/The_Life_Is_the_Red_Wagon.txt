You watch the slow train moving through the city late at night
Adjusting back and forth against the darkness and street lights
I know that you're feeling bad but I'm glad you didn't lie
Easy to get caught up but you know you can always, you can always
You can always walk away

The life is the red wagon rolling along
The life is the red wagon simple and strong
The life is the red, is the red, oh, it's no big deal
But when the feet are dragging you pull for me
And I pull for you, you pull for me and I pull for you

Past the teeming marketplace and the blur of faces there
Past the silent dockyards and the darkness looming there
Maybe it won't work this time but that's the risk you take
And you want to take it and just as long as it feels right doesn't matter
Just as long as doesn't matter gotta feel good though you don't know why

The life is the red wagon rolling along
The life is the red wagon keeps the feet upon the ground
The life is the red, is the red, oh, it's no big deal
But when the feet are dragging you pull for me
And I pull for you, you pull for me and I pull for you

The life is the red wagon simple and strong
The life is the red wagon simple and strong
The life is the red wagon simple and strong
