It's calling on me
If what I see is true
To me you're just a girl (oh yeah)
And it's starting baby

Julia
I don't know a thing about you
Soon enough
You'll be all I ever need

Too easy
All I ever need
Too cold
You'll be all I ever need
Are you mad about me? (All I ever need)
Or do you see a fool?
To me you're just the girl (you know that I)
Tell me (all I ever)
If it's starting baby
All I ever need

Julia
I don't know a thing about you
Soon enough
You'll be all I ever need

All I ever need
Too cold
You'll be all I ever need
It's calling on me (all I ever need)
If what I see is true
To me you're just a girl (oh yeah)
All I ever need
To get through
All I ever need

Julia (yeah all I ever need)
I don't know a thing about you (yeah all I ever need)
Soon enough (you know that I)
You'll be all I ever need

Julia (yeah all I ever need)
I can't do a thing without you (yeah all I ever need)
Soon enough (you know that I)
You'll be all I ever need
