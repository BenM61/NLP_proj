If I could make a wish I think I´d pass
Can´t think of anything I need
No cigarettes, no sleep, no light, no sound
Nothing to eat no books to read
Making love with you, has left me peaceful warm inside
What more could I ask
There´s nothing left to be desired

Sometimes all I need is the air that I breathe and to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe, yes, to love you
Just to have you now
All I need is the air that I breathe, you´re all I want

Peace came upon me and it breathes in me
Don´t sleep silent angel don´t you sleep

Sometimes all I need is the air that I breathe 
And to love you just to have you now
All I need is the air that I breathe yes to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe you´re all I want

Sometimes all I need is the air that I breathe and to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe, yes, to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe

Sometimes all I need is the air that I breathe and to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe yes to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe
