Ain't no angel.. standin' by me 
Good or evil it's all the same 
I'm defenceless leave me breathless 
When I hear your name.. 

You're my one vice, at a high price 
An addiction I just can't shake 
Gotta have it like a dirty habit 
That I just, can't, break 

(It's not your body), it's not your mind 
It's somethin' else 'cause I've had your kind before 
(It's more than love), more than your kiss 
The secret lies in your, fingertips 

(Hands on), you' got control o' me 
Push the buttons drive me (crazy baby) 
(Hands on) a hunger that I' gotta feed 
I'm a slave to your touch (hands on) 

(I want to lock you up, tie you down) 
'Cause tomorrow ya might be gone 
(Any fool knows to take a good thing) 
When it comes along... 

(It's not your money), it's not your style 
It's something else, that makes me wild for you 
(It's more than love), more than your kiss 
The secret lies in your, fingertips.. 

(Hands on), you' got control o' me 
Push the buttons drive me (crazy baby) 
(Hands on) a hunger that I' gotta feed 
I'm a slave to your touch (hands on) 

(Hands on), you' got control o' me 
Push the buttons drive me (crazy baby) 
(Hands on) a hunger that I' gotta feed 
I'm a slave to your touch (whoa-oh-oh) 
I need you oh so much (hands on) 
 
Come on baby, put your hands on this! 

It's not your body, it's not your mind 
It's somethin' else, that makes me wild for you 
(It's more than love), more than your kiss 
The secret lies in your, fingertips.. 
Oh yeah... 
Oh.. baby..
