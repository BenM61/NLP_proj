If I ever needed you,  I need you now
I can't remember when I've ever been so blue
If I ever needed love, I need it now
I feel so all alone I don't know what to do
No day or night goes by when I don't have my cry
I feel like I could die from wanting you
I can't ease my aching heart, but you'd know how
If I ever needed you I need you now
 
If I ever needed you,  I need you now
I can't remember when I've ever been so blue
If I ever needed love, I need it now
I feel so all alone I don't know what to do
No day or night goes by when I don't have my cry
I feel like I could die from wanting you
I can't ease my aching heart, but you'd know how
If I ever needed you I need you now
