I misbehaved, done some things I know I shouldn't do
I touched myself, even though you told me not to
You commanded me to wait for you (I tried)
But I can smell you on my sheets
Taste you on my skin so vividly
Daddy I disobeyed you
Now I want you to come punish me

Babe, I need some discipline tonight
Don't hold back
I've been very bad
Make me cry
Got to make me cry

Babe, I need some discipline tonight
Don't hold back
I've been very bad
Make me cry
Got to make me cry
Babe

I misbehaved
And my punishment should fit my crime
Tie me to something
Take off all my clothes
Daddy I want you to take you're time (I'm scared)
My heart is beatin' fast
Shiver as you grab my neck
Baby, blindfold me daddy
Is better when I don't know what to expect

Babe, I need some discipline tonight
Don't hold back
I've been very bad
Make me cry
Got to make me cry

Babe, I need some discipline tonight
Don't hold back
I've been very bad
Make me cry
Got to make me cry
Babe

Did I upset you daddy
Take out you're frustrations on me
Did I make you mad
Take out you're frustrations on me
You be the teacher, I'll be the student
Tell me to do it, and I will do it
I'm under you're command
You be the teacher, I'll be the student
Tell me to do it, and I will do it

Babe, I need some discipline tonight
Don't hold back
I've been very bad
Make me cry
Got to make me cry

Babe, I need some discipline tonight
Don't hold back
I've been very bad
Make me cry
Got to make me cry
Babe
