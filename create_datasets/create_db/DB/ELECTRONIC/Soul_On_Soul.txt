I was blinded forever 
By the beautiful light of madness in your eyes 

Such a sweet revelation 
And the darkest sensation on soul on soul 

Soul on soul 
Soul on soul 
On soul 

Soul on soul 
Soul on soul 
On soul! 

With heaven around me 
Your ?? gets around me in your arms again 

For once I was lost and 
Somehow you found me and I was yours again 

Soul on soul 
Soul on soul 
On soul 

Soul on soul 
Soul on soul 
On soul! 

Soul on soul 
Soul on soul 
On soul! 

Soul on soul 
Soul on soul 
On soul! 

Soul on soul 
Soul on soul 
On soul!
