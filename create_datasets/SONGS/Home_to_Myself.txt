I wake up and see
The light of the day
Shining on me
Make my own time
It's mine to spend
Think to myself
My own best friend
It's not so bad all alone
Comin' home to myself again
Now I understand

Whatever I feel is whoever I am
Watching my life and how its grown
Looking on back to friends I've known
Its not so bad all alone
Coming home to myself again
It's not so bad to get lost in my tears
And to laugh and to cry for the years gone by
Oh my, oh my

Now somehow I know
I've come a long way
Got a long way to go
But something inside
Keeps making me strong
And in the bad times
I'll get along
'Cause it's not so bad all alone
Comin' home to myself again
I'm comin' home
