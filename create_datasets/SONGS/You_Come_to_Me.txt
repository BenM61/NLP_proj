I spelled out your name written with all the stars I see
And like that you vanished instantly

Love, oh
You will come to me, you'll come to me, you'll come

Blinded by familiar strangers, deafened by their sounds
I could never follow you around
I'll wait by the Annex door until my poisoned mouth
Takes all my intentions to the south

Love, oh
You will come to me, you'll come to me, you'll come
Love, oh
You will come to me, you'll come to me, you'll come
To me in time, to me in time, time, time

And the little things, the smallest habits
Are the hardest ones to break
But I'm breaking all the ones I used to love
Because I'm seeing through you, seeing right through you
I'm seeing through you, seeing right through you now

I spelled out your name written with all the stars I see
And like that you vanished instantly
Love, oh
You will come to me, you'll come to me, you'll come
Love, oh
You will come to me, you'll come to me, you'll come
You come to me 
You come to me 
You come to me 
You come to me 

You come to me 
You come to me 
You come to me 
You come to me
