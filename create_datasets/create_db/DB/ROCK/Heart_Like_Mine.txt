Don't you know that we're out of touch,
Yeah, we fight too much,
How'd we ever get so messed up?
Every night, we say the craziest things
You know our words they once had wings.

Now it's all covered up
In double-talk and lies
There's a stranger looking back
When I look in your eyes.

Now it's all covered up
In double-talk and lies
There's a stranger looking back
When I look in your eyes.

I just want to find a heart like mine
I just want to find a heart like mine
A heart like mine, a heart like mine.

You call me a fool, 'cause I still feel the same.
You say that your love has changed,
Ah! Here we go again
Close your eyes tell me what do you see
Do you still remember me?
Like some Mexican diplomat
After the fact
Air-brushed from history
Swept under the mat.

I just want to find a heart like mine
I just want to find a heart like mine
A heart like mine, a heart like mine.

And as I walk out the door
I step into a dream.
The world's quiet and I feel free,
But things are never what they seem
But then I hear you call
And warn myself, now don't go back
But slow motion attacks
Like some Mexican diplomat
After the fact
Air-brushed from history
Swept under the mat.

I just want to find a heart like mine
I just want to find a heart like mine
A heart like mine, a heart like mine.
