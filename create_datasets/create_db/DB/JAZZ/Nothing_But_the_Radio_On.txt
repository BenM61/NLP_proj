Life, shades of blue
Love was bittersweet 'til I found you
Time after time
Feelings disappear

Friend when we met
Life was like a joke I didn't get
But when you're holding me
You make me understand
What this heart is for

Now we've nothing but the radio on
We are dancing to a new emotion
We've got nothing but the radio on
We're making love in slow motion

Ooh, one night like this
Can melt away the lonely emptiness
Each perfect kiss
Answers every wish I wish

There in your eyes
I can see the years of tears I cried
And though the waiting game 
Is all I ever play
It's time to let love in

Now we've nothing but the radio on
We are dancing to a new emotion
We've got nothing but the radio on
We're making love in slow motion

Hey girl, oh

When nothing is right
We can't go wrong
And so tonight
They're playing our song

We're kiss to kiss
And heart to heart
And the music never stops
Once the love starts

We've got nothing but the radio on

Hey baby
Nothing but the radio on
Ooh, love in slow motion
Ooh, nothing but the radio on

We are dancing to a new emotion
Hey baby, nothing but the radio on
Making love in slow motion
We've got nothing but the radio on
Don't you know, we've got
Nothing but the radio on
