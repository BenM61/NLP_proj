[Chris Rock   Intro] 

Goodevening Class of 1999 I have 
One piece of advice for you no 
Matter what a stripper tells you 
There is no sex in the champagne 
Room 
Oh there's Champagne in the champagne 
Room but you don't want Champagne you 
Sex in the Champagne room 

Don't go to parties with metal detectors 
Sure it fells safe inside but what about 
All those mutherfucka's waitin outside wit 
Guns they know you ain't got one if a women 
Says she's twenty and she looks sixteen she's 
Twelve if she tells you she's twentysix and 
Looks twentysix she's damn near 40 take off 
That silly ass hat the ODB couldn't have 
Possible committed all those crimes Coolio did 
Some of that shit young blackman if you go to 
The movie theater and someone steps on your foot 
Let it slide why spend the next twenty years in 
Jail cause someone smudged your pumas cornbread 
Ain't nothin wrong wit that no matter what you think 
Of what I'm saying remember this one thing there's 
No sex in he champagne room 

[Gerald Lervert] 

Uhh 
No sex in the champagne room 
No sex in the champagne room 
No sex in the champagne room 
No sex in the champagne room 
No sex in the champagne room 
No sex in the champagne room 
Abosolety postively no sex in the champagne 
Abosolety postively no sex in the champagne 

[Chris Rock] 

If a homeless person has a funny sign 
He hasn't been homeless for that long 
A real homeless person is too hungry 
To be funny if a girl has a pierced tongue 
She'll probably suck you dick if a guy has 
A pireced tongue he'll probably suck you dick 
Here's a harascope for everyone 
Aquarius your going die 
Capricorn your going die 
Gemini your going die twice 
Leo your going die 
Scorpio your going die fuckin 
No one go's to hooters for wings 
If you been datinga man for four 
Months and you haven't met any of 
His friends your not his girlfriend 
Some of the things I've said may not 
Apply to you some of the things I may 
Have said may offened you 
No matter who you are yo must 
Remember this one thing no matter 
What a stripper says 
There is no sex in the champagne room 
NONE! 

[Gerald Lervert] 

There's no sex sex in the champagne room 
There's no sex sex in the champagne room

In the champagne room na na say na na
