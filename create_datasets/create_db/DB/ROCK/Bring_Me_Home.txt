There is this emptyness I carry around with me
Just like a hole that you will never see
I wander in the sun but it's cold inside of me
I'm a monkey in the zoo but someone cut my tree

Hey God if you are really up there and I am not alone
Just do me a favor,
Bring me home
Just do me a favor,
Bring me home

My oversized bedroom appears so small without you
I've tried it all from pills to gin but haven't found the clue
It's like someone has locked the door so I can't get through
To where the emptyness is wiped away by you

Hey God if you are really up there and I am not alone
Just do me a favor,
Bring me home
