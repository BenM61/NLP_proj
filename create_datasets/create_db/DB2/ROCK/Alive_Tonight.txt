Ahh, ahh, ahh - tonight
Ahh, ahh
Object movers have done nothing on me
Take me to the party I just want to feel free
I won't pass the bastard? nightmares into another Sunday
I won't pass the bastard? nightmares into another Sunday

When they asked me want I wanted to do
What kind of job do you think we're due to
I said I don't know I just want to feel alive tonight
Well I don't know I just want to feel alive tonight

Remember high life isn't won by degrees
No one understands it, just like your little sneeze???????
But there is another world where you can't see me
But there is another world where you can't see me

When they asked me want I wanted to do
What kind of job do you think we're due to
I said I don't know I just want to feel alive tonight
Well I don't know I just want to feel alive tonight

Tonight
Tonight
Well that's right

(Solo)

When they asked me want I wanted to do
What kind of job do you think we're due to
I said I don't know I just want to feel alive tonight
Well I don't know I just want to feel alive tonight

To-to-tonight
To-to-tonight
When they asked me
Well when they asked me
I just want to be alive to-
I just want to be alive to-
To-to-tonight
To-to-to-tonight
To-to-to-tonight
To-to-to-tonight
To-to-to-tonight
