Over and over
I tried to prove my love to you
Over and over
What more can I do

Over and over
My friends say I'm a fool
But over and over
I'll be a fool for you

'Cause you've got personality,
Walk, with personality
Talk, with personality
Smile, with personality

Charm, personality
Love, personality
And plus you've got
A great big heart

So over (over and over) and over
Oh, I'll be a fool for you
Now over (over and over) and over
What more can I do?

'Cause you've got personality,
Walk, with personality
Talk, with personality
Smile, with personality

Charm, with personality
Love, with personality
And of course you've got
A great big heart

So over (over and over) and over
Oh, I'll be a fool for you
Now over (over and over) and over
What more can I do?

Over and over
I said that I loved you
Over and over
Honey now it's the truth

Over and over
They still say I'm a fool
But over and over
I'll be a fool for you

'Cause you've got personality
Walk, with personality
Talk, with personality
Smile, with personality

Charm, with personality
Love, with personality
And of course you've got
A great big heart

So over (over and over) and over
Oh, I'll be a fool for you
Now over (over and over) and over
What more can I do?
