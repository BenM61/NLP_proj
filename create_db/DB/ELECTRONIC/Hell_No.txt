Wait, before you leave I've got something to say - so listen tome 
I know you wanted to hate me
When you found out that I lied
I want to spend eternity
But you say you've been deceived
Now you say you want to leave
But I say 

Hell no, hell no I won't let you leave me this time
Hell no, hell no don't act like you never lied to me
Hell no, hell no my actions are not justified
Remember the many nights I cried
So hell no you can't leave me this time 

Now I know the circumstances
Do you remember what you did to me
When I found that other hoochy's pictures
Had em inside Dru Hill's CD
I'm not trying to go back and forth
I'm just trying to let you know
I've forgiven you a hundred times, so
Baby, I'm not gonna let you go so 

Hell no, hell no I won't let you leave me this time
Hell no, hell no don't act like you never lied to me
Hell no, hell no my actions are not justified
Remember the many nights I cried
So hell no you can't leave me this time 

Don't leave me now
I'll be here if you stay stay right here 

Hell no, hell no I won't let you leave me this time
Don't leave me
Hell no, hell no oh don't you go away
Hell no, hell no I'm so sorry, so sorry baby
Hell no, you can't leave me this time
Hell no, hell no what do you think
Do you think I can be all alone
Hell no, hell no can you forgive me can you forgive me baby
Hell no, hell no hell no you can't leave me this time 

Don't leave me now
Stay right here
