All bets are off
Lay your cards on the table
Draw down the moon
All bets are off
'Cause I know you're not able
And everything will be ending soon

I don't speak, I don't feel
'Cause I know that it's over
But this hurt is unreal
So I'm holding on
I don't speak, I don't feel
But I know what it takes
This is how it feels when a heart breaks
This is how it feels when a heart breaks

Just one more time
Let me dream of fresh fortune
Just one more time
Freak show divine
All the things that I can't do
Crowd and muddle my mind

Was it always ever this?
Were we condemned to an end?
A bitterness that tastes so sweet
No matter what I do
Must I always think of you
Forever, forever?

I don't speak, I don't feel
'Cause I know that it's over
But this hurt is unreal
So I'm holding on
I don't speak, I don't feel
But I know what it takes
This is how it feels when a heart breaks
This is how it feels when a heart breaks
When a heart breaks

I don't speak, I don't feel
'Cause I know that it's over
But this hurt is unreal
So I'm holding on
I don't speak, I don't feel
But I know what it takes
This is how it feels when a heart breaks
This is how it feels when a heart breaks
Oh, this is how it feels
So this is how it feels.
