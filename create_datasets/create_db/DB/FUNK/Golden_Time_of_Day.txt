There's a time of the day when the sun is going down
That's the golden time of day
It's a time that the sun turns a gold all around
That's the golden time of day
At the end of the day when the wind is soft and warm
Don't it make the flowers sway

When the sun settles down and it takes a lovley form
That's the golden time of day

People let me tell you
There's a time in your life when you find who you are
That's the golden time of day

In you mind you will find your a bright shining star
Ooh that's the golden time of day
When you feel deep inside all the love your lookin' for
Don't it make you feel ok
Like the time of the day when the sun is going down
That's the golden time of day
That's the golden time of day
That's the golden time of day

Shining can't you see it shining ooh ooh ooh ooh
Shining can't you see it shining ooh ooh ooh ooh
