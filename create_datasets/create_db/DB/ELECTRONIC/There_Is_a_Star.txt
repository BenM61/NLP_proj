There is a star 
There is a star 

There is a star, there is a star 
There must be one 
Whatever you wish it will be done 
And if you believe the star's always shining 

There is a star, there is a star 
There must be one 
Whatever you wish it will be done 
And if you believe the star's always shining 

Star light, so bright. First star 
I see tonight. Make me think about life 
The meaning you and me, myself, I 
Can you picture why 
If your mind is strong, no matter what's going on 
Believe in yourself and shine on 
And the meaning is so clear to see 
Understand the power then a life goes deep 
Then a life goes deep 

There is a star, there is a star 
There must be one 
Whatever you wish it will be done 
And if you believe the star's always shining 
There is a star, there is a star 

Just let it go, but believe in you, 
Do what you want to do, with the limit true 
Twinkle, twinkle see the star 
Now believe in who you are 
Cause all you want is a future of love and peace 
Then everything is clear to see 
The starting point is the star 
Just believe in who you are

There is a star, there is a star 
There must be one 
Whatever you wish it will be done 
And if you believe the star's always shining 
There is a star, there is a star 
There is a star

There is a star, there is a star 
There must be one 
Whatever you wish it will be done 
And if you believe the star's always shining 

There is a star, there is a star 
There must be one 
Whatever you wish it will be done 
And if you believe the star's always shining 
There is a star, there is a star 
There is a star
