I went running to the end of a rainbow
Looking for a treasure they said I would find
I found nothing but heartaches and troubles
I'm about to lose my mind

On the way, the load got heavy
And the burdens got hard to bear
None of my friends was there to help me
Left me standing in the middle of nowhere

With a heart full of pain, I was lost
So blind I couldn't see a thing
I couldn't even remember my name
They talked loud and clear

Every word, my ears could hear
In my heart was heavy
I couldn't even move
I just stood there like a silly fool

I believe, I'm going, back home
To start all over again
Left my rainbow behind me
Right where I, I began

Going, going, going, going home
I'm going home
(I'm going home to the end of the rainbow)
I'm going home
(I'm going home to the end of the rainbow)
Going, going, going, going home
I'm going home

Going, going, going, going home
I'm going home
(I'm going home to the end of the rainbow)
I'm going home
(I'm going home to the end of the rainbow)
Going, going, going, going home
I'm going home
