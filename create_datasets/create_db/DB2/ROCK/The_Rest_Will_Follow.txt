How can anyone be so unkind
As to want to take another's piece of mind?
Is acceptance so implausible?
Well I know how the best will fall
And the rest will follow.

It's important to recognize
In this world we live there is nothing worth dying
It's enough to say "hello", we're all human
But I know how the best will fall
And the rest will follow

Is it so easy to resign
To ruin this world for everyone?
I guess when it's all said and done
It's just something in our design.

We are all of us so capable of
The greatest acts of hate and the worst acts of love
I wonder sometimes what's the matter with us all
And I know how the best will fall
And the rest will follow...
