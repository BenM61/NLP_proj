Baby me, come on and pet me, honey, baby me 
You know you get me when you give me that affectionate talk 
Like "darling, dearie, precious, pretty", I could go for "itty bitty"
Baby me, because I love it when you baby me 
The beauty of it is that I love you and you love me too 
So baby, won't you baby me!
