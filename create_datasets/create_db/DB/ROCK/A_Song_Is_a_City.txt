See him walking in the park 
With a few things on his mind 
He's been talking with the ones 
With the ones that he loves 

Tell me who is gonna pay 
I'm so anxious I don't know 
You can see it on their face 
As it takes its toll 

And he takes his time 
Yeh he takes his time 
No one ever, ever gonna mind 
I don't care what the future holds 
All I know is that I'm getting old 

I think I've had an affair 
At least that's what they call it these days 
And it wasn't very fair 
To the ones that I love 
Well I just pushed her away 
There was nothing I could say 
Now I hang myself each night 
With this noose that I built 

And he takes his time yeah he takes his time 
No one ever, ever gonna mind 
I don't care what the future holds 
All that I know is that I'm getting old
