I saw her in the neighborhood
She was movin' sideways
Not lookin' too good
Then I saw her in the parking lot
Wearing Blackmail and she was smokin' pot
On the arm of Antonio
Lookin' for love inside the rodeo
Top ranking in a three piece suit
Like a black work model 
In lonestar boots

Singing 
Street songs of love
Singing
Street songs of love
Singing
Street songs of love
Singing
Street songs of love

I saw her dancing on a beachland night
Movin' for money on some bad advice
Her reflection was her drug of choice
Praticed apologies in a voodoo voice
Her hips were gliding to a 
Les Paul scream
Harder then the rest like a tin machine
Top ranking in a mohair suit
Like a tattooed Elvis
In a Jaguar boot

Singing
Street songs of love
Singing
Street songs of love
Singing
Street songs of love
Singing
Street songs of love

The happy hour is winding down
I want to hang but there's no on around
I saw her dancing in the parking lot
Wearing Blackmail and she was smokin' pot
On the arm of Antonio
Lookin' for love inside the rodeo
Top ranking in a gas mask kiss
Like a tattooed Elvis
In a French movie twist

Singing
Street songs of love
Singing
Street songs of love
Singing
Street songs of love
Singing
Street songs of love
