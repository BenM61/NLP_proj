Heart and soul Baby 
There's no goal
Turn the lights on bright
You're a rock and roll star
Feel my love
Coming from the heavens above
When my eyes meet your eyes
You know it's true

[Chorus]
Baby come dance with me
Baby come dance with me
On TV at the TV station
Baby come dance with me
Baby come dance with me
On TV at the TV station

You are lost
And I'm at home
And nobody wants to be here alone
Oh baby's in mint condition
Man I'm doin' some dirty wishin'
Let's both get on that rocket to the stars

[Chorus]
