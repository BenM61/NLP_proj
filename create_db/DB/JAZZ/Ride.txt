The rides are fast, the thrill is mean
Your heart is pumping, you're sure to scream
You'll always go, for another ride
The second time, you'll be on the other side
You hold on tight, you have no sight, not even a clue
The carnie man has a plan, they know what to do
Round and round and round and round and round you go
Where you get off, only we'll know
You find yourself in a cold room of glass
Signs of counless children, reflections past
Things you knew and loved are hard to see
Your body's empty, your wills been taken by me
Submerged - Tell ya what I'm gonna do
Submerged - Someone's gonna make a slave out of you
Submerged - Not really sure the price you'll bring
Submerged - And you're not gonna say anything
Submerged - Now for the shocking truth
Submerged - Our conditioning it's "fool proof"
Submerged - Endless stock, supply and demand
Submerged - How about another ride, the kiddies ride for free
Another day, another town
Gather round for the greatest show on earth
That's it folks, there's for one and all
And the kiddies ride for free
