When the VJ shoots the beam
I take my partner from the screen
And hold her close I hold her close
One more chance to make it right
Holding hands in black and white

I'll meet you there, I'll meet you there
Leave my mind back in my room
Maybe I will blow it soon and fall in love
At the videotheque (the videotheque)
We can dance forever
At the videotheque (the videotheque)
We control it all
At the videotheque (the videotheque)

Ghosts are only lovers on the screen
Only pictures on the wall
They don't mean a thing at all
And I don't care
When the visions start to form
The same illusion takes us all
And you are there you are there
Slowly senses leaving me

Once the two are in 3D we play the game
At the videotheque (the videotheque)
We can dance forever
At the videotheque (the videotheque)
We can fall in love
At the videotheque (the videotheque)

Ghosts are only lovers on the screen
The videotheque
The videotheque
The videotheque only ghosts are lovers on the screen
Videotheque
