The more I see, the less I scream,
The figure eight inside out is infinity
The naked light bulb is always on
They make your break complete
Then they blow it to kingdom come

Riderless horses, Noam Chomsky's Camelot
Bruises on my hands from digging my nails out
A series of images against you and me
Trespass your torments
If you are what you wanna be

I once impersonated a shopwork dummy
The Levi jean will always be stronger than the Uzi
A dwarf takes his cockerel out of the cockfight
Falcons attack the pigeons
In the west wing at night
