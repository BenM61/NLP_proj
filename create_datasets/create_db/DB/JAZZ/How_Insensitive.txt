How insensitive
I must have seemed
When she told me that he loved me
How unmoved and cold

I must have seemed
When she told me so sincerely
Why she must have asked
Did I just turn and stare in icy silence

What was I to say
What can you say when a love affair is over

Now she's gone away
And I'm alone with the memory of her last look
Vague and drawn and sad
I see it still

All her heartbreak in that last look
Why she must have asked
Did I just stare in icy silence
What was I to do
What can one do when a love affair is over
