This place a palace of light drawn with shade
Of silence and pretence a token of our trade
And here you and I lie wreathed in flames
All over a life lived by making up new games
Of gazes and whispers

I want you to know I still love you
Even though we've been dancing on broken glass
Parade all your memories for the moments we shared
Never fade away

I want you to know I still love you
When I walk down the memory lane
Where the night swears its love to the stars
There will be no more tears today, hey, hey

We share a penchant for cyanide praise
Fashioned our armors of empathy's malaise
And all of that hurt, and all of those words that we said
You'd think we poisoned the ground on which we tread
But the lining is silver

I want you to know I still love you
Even though we've been dancing on broken glass
Parade all your memories for the moments we shared
Never fade away

I want you to know I still love you
When I walk down the memory lane
Where the night swears its love to the stars
There will be no more tears today, hey, hey

The best of intentions will not see the road paved
The end of illusions, who could ever be saved
What's left behind in the storms that we've braved
The troubles we find and the chances we waived

We're going where dreams really come true
And we won't be held back by our fears
Come hell or high water
We'll trust there's a life for us here this way

I want you to know I still love you
Even though we've been dancing on broken glass
Parade all your memories for the moments we shared
Never fade away

I want you to know I still love you
When I walk down the memory lane
Where the night swears its love to the stars
There will be no more tears today, hey, hey, hey, hey
