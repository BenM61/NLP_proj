Break up already wake up now
Walk away take it all back now
Don't be quick to lick the scab off
You're spitting in his face with the rest of them

Walk away take it all back now
Don't be quick to lick the scab off

Please give me something I'm so thirsty,
I'm so thirsty
Oh please, let me warn them,
Don't you come here, don't bring anyone here

The chasm isn't fixed yet.
Take this water
Drinking ever deeper, living water

Please give me something I'm so thirsty
I'm so thirsty
Oh, please, let me warn them.
Don't you come here, don't bring anyone here

Please
