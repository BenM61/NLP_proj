Come in, take a chair
Nothing else to do out there
Is what you want, what you need
Decisions made in privacy

Step right up and name your game
Take a chance, pick a card, any card
I'll guess your age, I'll name your fate
Don't be shy I'm waiting

Come to the sideshow
Come to the sideshow, yeah
Come to the sideshow
Come and get your mind blown, yeah

Mysterious and curious
Boredom is so serious
The red velvet curtain draws
There's no way to hide your flaws

Now you've come to see your show
It feels like what you've learned ain't vogue
Do you know what you're looking at
Can you see what is staring back

You're in the sideshow
Come to the sideshow, yeah
Come to the sideshow
Come and get your mind blown, yeah

The government, firmament, spearmint, double mint
Handshaking, green berets, looking cool and talking sharp
And you say this and that and that ain't where it's at

Time can wash away the fears
Stay away from the devil's tears
Get off your knees and on your feet
Can you feel the heartbeat

Come to the sideshow
Come to the sideshow, yeah
Come to the sideshow
Come and get your mind blown, yeah

Time can wash away the fears
Stay away from the devil's tears
Off your knees and on your feet
Don't be shy I'm waiting

Come to the sideshow
Come to the sideshow, yeah
Come to the sideshow
Come and get your mind blown, yeah

Come to the sideshow
Come to the sideshow, yeah
Come to the sideshow
Come and get your mind blown, yeah

Come to the sideshow
You're in the sideshow
Come to the sideshow
Come and get your mind blown

Come to the sideshow
Come and get your mind blown, yeah
Come to the sideshow
Come get your mind blown
Come to the sideshow
