Me, I'm gonna rise in the morning and fade into the sunlight and you
You're gonna miss me
See me
Kiss me in your midnight dreams and fantasies
Where you have me any way you wanna
There I have you any way I wanna and see you when the sun sets again

This time I've gotta run from your other your brother and your mother
And I can't
I just can't say that I'm sorry
They hate me 'cause baby I'm in your midnight dreams and fantasies
Where I have you any way I wanna ( any way I wanna)
And you have me any way you wanna (any way you wanna)
You know we do anything we wanna (anything we wanna)

All night with you anything we wanna, anything we wanna, anything we wanna

I wanna hold you so tight baby
I wanna keep you warm till the sun rise
Falling deeper and deeper into you
Falling deeper and deeper into you
I, I
If you got a lock, I got the key
If you got the honey baby, I'll be the bee
Oh yeah, oh oh don't wake me baby, don't wake me no
'Cause just like you I get lonely too
I get lonely too
