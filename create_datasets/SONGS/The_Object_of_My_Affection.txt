The object of my affection
Can change my complexion
From white to a rosy read

Anytime he holds my hand and tells me that he's mine
There are many boys who can thrill me
And some who can chill me

But I'll just hang around
And keep acting like a clown
Until he says he's mine

Now I'm not afraid that he'll leave me
He's not the kind who takes a dare
But instead I trust him implicitly
He can go where he wants to go
Do what he wants to do
I don't care

The object of my affection
Can change my complexion
From white to a rosy read
Anytime he holds my hand and tells me that he's mine
