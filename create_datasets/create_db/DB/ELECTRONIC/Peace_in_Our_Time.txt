Go swiftly
The flags and drums can hypnotize
When glory has faded the dream is worth more than the prize
A twisting, turning flame
Of freedom burning bright
Knows all of the names
And all of the games of the yellow, black and white
We gotta have faith
To work it out
Faith and hope
Without a doubt
Give us strength to make a start
Put a song in our hearts...

We're never gonna break down walls
And build a prison with the stone
'Cause you and I know what this is worth
We're gonna build heaven on earth
We're running in the wheels of fortune
Turning water into wine
We're gonna take love and make it shine
We're gonna find peace in our time...

Softly, softly
When there is lightning in the sky
When rivers are rising and trouble rolls in on the tide
We'll keep on keeping on
'Til all the tears are dry
We'll weather the storm and welcome the dawn
Of tomorrow you and I...

We've gotta have faith...(faith)
And get it fast
Faith and hope...(hope)
And let it last
Give us strength...(strength)
To reach the stars, put a song in our hearts.

At the sign...(sign) of the dove...(love)
Is gonna shine...(shine) shine (shine) shine
On a wing...(sing) and a prayer...(yeah)
We'll be fine...(fine) fine (fine) fine...

People! People!
Do you believe in what you see
Surrounded by fire and magic are you really free
It's heating! Heating up!
Along the avenue
We're raisin' the dust it's heaven or bust

We will see this dream come true
We're gonna have faith...(faith)
The road will be long
Now there's hope...(hope)
To carry us on
We'll have strength...(strength)
We'll never go wrong, with this song in our hearts
