There were days
When we use to lounge
Hangin' out in my car
Till the sun went down

When I'd call
You'd pick up the phone
Tell me now much you were alone
Let's get deep

If I ever broke down
Gave you what I felt now
Would you still hang around

Are we crazy for feeling this way
You used to laugh until you cried
You and I keeping the world at bay
We'd sit around all day
Let's get deep

If I ever broke down
Gave you what I felt now
Would you still hang around

Closer and closer
every time we turn around
You'll never be lonely
I'll keep you beside me
Deeper and deeper
I'll never go away

Sun falls torrential your highness
I'm think about the days we left behind us
Sunshine and rain and misery
I'm lookin' at you beside me here
Now I don't know how
You came into my life wonderin' will you be my wife
Spend a day or two in Spain or France
In the rain will dance
Your heart next to mine beatin'
In the rain let me explain
Let me do my think and tell you how I feel
This love is for real

Summer's finally found us
The children playing in the sun
Baby can't you see our time has come
Turning on my radio I hear the song, and see your face
Cause you are the one I can't replace
So let's get deep

I would give in learn to depend
That I'll be there until the end
There were days
When we use to lounge
Hangin' out in my car
Till the sun went down

When I'd call
You'd pick up the phone
Tell me now much you were alone
Let's get deep

I would give in learn to depend
That I'll be there until
