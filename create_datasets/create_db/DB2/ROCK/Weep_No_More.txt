You left the room, without a sound.
And as you both walked out,
the people still were dancing 'round.
And when you touched,
did it feel so bad.
You didn't pull away, but now you wish you had.
My baby's sad.

Weep no more, I'm here beside you,
even though you let me down.
Weep no more, let my love guide you,
shelter you from all around.
Na Na Na Na...

Were you wrong? Did you go too far?
Sitting with him in the back seat of the car.
Though you were young,
I guess he thought you knew.
Now it's just a little while before the baby's due.
My baby's blue.

Weep no more, I'm here beside you,
even though you let me down.
Weep no more, let my love guide you,
shelter you from all around.
Na Na Na Na...
