Sweet little baby don't you talk too much
Tell me little girl can ya feel my touch
'Cause I have had seven times
Fallen for a girl who can't be mine

Don't go
Into the gutter
Into the gutter
 
Did you even know that the line exists
Girl you need me and I need you
Living right alone when I can't be moved 

Don't go
Into the gutter
Into the gutter
Into the gutter
Into the gutter

Hey! 
Losing time
Ohh, you, aww, can't be mine

Feeling that my time has come
Living on the line
Don't you know
That you mean so much to me

Oohh, please don't go
Into the gutter
