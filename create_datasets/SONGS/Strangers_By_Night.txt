When you're down and feelin' blue 
Close your eyes, I'll be with you 
Oh heartache, here comes heartache 
Makin' love for him was fun 
He never needed anyone 
Oh heartache, here comes heartache 

Strangers by night 
Be strangers tomorrow 
'Cause deep in the night 
The light is fooling your hearts 
And lovers tonight inside our hearts 
Are lovers tomorrow 
But lovers by night 
Sometimes be strangers today 

Nights won't last forever, girl 
Strange are the ways of this world 
Oh heartache, here comes heartache 
Cinderella, heroes wait 
For your hard times it's too late 
Oh heartache, here comes heartache 

Strangers tonight 
Be strangers tomorrow 
Lady, tonight 
Tonight be careful with love 
Some love is too hot, too hot to stop 
A bad fall tomorrow 
And lovers by night 
Sometimes be strangers today 
And lovers by night 
Sometimes be strangers today
