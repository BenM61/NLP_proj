Fireworks exploding
In a 21 gun salute
Fireworks exploding

Angels are crying
Through a crystal Irish flute
Angels are crying

Champagne is spilling
Champagne is spilled

As if a million flowers
Had suddenly been killed
As if a million flowers

Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today
Dearly beloved

We have come together
For the love that got away
For the love that got away

Naked on a staircase
That we could never build

As if a million flowers
Had suddenly been killed
As if a million flowers

As if a million flowers
As if a million flowers
As if a million flowers

Roulette, roulette, place your bet
Roulette, roulette, cigarette

As if a million flowers
As if a million flowers
As if a million flowers
As if a million flowers

And the last time
