I heard this girl one day.
She had these long, tight legs.
She said, "I get it every night,
and he calls me every day.

He'll leave you black and blue.
He'll rip you right in two,
then wake up in the morning, 
and say "Who the hell are you?"

And then she turns to me and says "We know you.
Tell us some secrets, honey. We won't say a word."

But I say nothing, I talk to no-one.
I know what I believe. Don't need to wear it on my sleeve.
I talk to no-one, I will say nothing.
If we come and go alone, why do they need to know?

The boy who's always mad.
He's just alone and sad.
He holds my hand so tightly.
He says "Go away, I'm bad.

I'll leave you black and blue
I'll rip you right in two.
But it is just because 
I do not know how to be true.

That's why I sometimes stand alone at parties.
That's why I drink, so I'll be who they think I am.

But don't say nothing. Don't talk to no-one.
I'm not what they believe, and if they find out they will leave.
Don't talk to no-one, Just don't say nothing.
If we come and go alone, why do they need to know?
(Arcades)

All those endless days of all those sci-fi slaves.
The noise is just a drag until you say close your eyes,
and listen...
They're singing just for you
It's swinging just for you
It's screaming just for you

(instumental break)


I'll say nothing. 
I'll talk to no-one.

There is a place somewhere
Some times you'll find me there
And If I am alone 
I will be sitting on the stairs.

I'll be as good as new.
One of the lucky few,
who's laughing at the joke, and
as I leave I laugh for you.

But I say nothing, I talk to no-one.
I know what I believe. Don't need to wear it on my sleeve.
I talk to no-one, I will say nothing.
If we come and go alone, then what's the point of carrying these arcades?


I'll say nothing. 
I'll talk to no-one.
I will say nothing. 
I'll talk to no-one, but you.
