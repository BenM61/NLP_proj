Doot'n do doo doot'n do doo doo Angela Jones

I'll meet you at your locker when school's dismissed
I'll carry your books home if you just give me one little
Doot'n do doo...

You know I love you darling more than I do life
Some day we'll get some preacher and let him make us man and
Doot'n do doo...

Each night I pray to heaven way up above
That you won't ever forget me and give somebody else your
Doot'n do doo...

I love your kind of loving I's always been true
I love the way you whisper I'll always be in love with
Doot'n do doo...
