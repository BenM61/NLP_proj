Some equal man here is telling it to me
On how to live and what I ought to be
I don't like you, I don't like what you do
I don't like it when you tell me to

Walk in line
Walk in line
Walk in line
Walk in line
I'll tell you something you don't seem to understand
It's already going according to the plan
You're free to choose your attitude
And free to lose what's inside of you

Love is a power that makes the heart
Yet the heart can't make that power
And that the walk of love is strong, strong, strong
You know what we are
We are children
We can love and listen to our soul
There's a place for everybody here
To that space now never should we fear to
