You know what is when you hear that, hann (JAE5)
Did you see what?
Montana
Did you see what I done?
Yeah, yeah
Did you see what I?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam when niggas wanna try somethin'
Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one

Ride with the clique, smoke, lick it up
Then hop, jump, skip, quick to pick her up
And you should see when I come
Come in the left lane, leave with the right one
Intra, white one, two tuck
Baby, I ain't typin', clipped like a hyphen
About to go bananas
Have you 2 steppin' with the dances
Blue and white diamonds like Kansas

She poked the top, I backed up on her
We fell in love on the corner
You the plug, I'm the outlet socket
Drop top it, 8 ball, right pocket

Take step for me by your ride
In the smoke with me, I'd jump in the fire for you
I'd die for you, blue face smile for you
Toke on doobie now, lock the city down
I'm just a hoodlum, smile every day
You should see where I come from
You should see what I done
Thought it was a one-done
She kept it a hun-dun

She poked the top, I backed up on her
We fell in love on the corner
You the plug, I'm the outlet socket
Drop top it, 8 ball, right pocket
