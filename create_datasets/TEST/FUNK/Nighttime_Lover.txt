Strangers in the dark
We kiss and we touch
The little things can mean so much
Smoke is in our eyes
Let's finish the wine
It's time to kiss and say good-bye
Oh, oh, I wonder where you go
When the darkness fades and the tracesshow
Oh, oh I wonder if she knows 
That all my days are filled with dreams of my

Nighttime lover, over and over
I dream of us dancin' in the dark, me and my
Nighttime lover, love undercover 
W'ere lost in this love is where we are

This heart is not so smart
It knew from the start
This tenderness would cause a fire
Love is always blind
The truth isn't always kind
We ask no questions, tell no lies
Oh, oh I wonder where you go
When the party's over, will I know
Oh, oh I wonder if she knows
That I could spend my life being her

Nighttime lover, she's like no other
Nighttime lover, over and over
I dream of us dancin' in the dark
Me and my nighttime lover, she's like no other
We're lost in this love is where we are
Me and my nighttime (lover) over and over
Dream of us dancing in the dark
Me and my nighttime (lover) lover undercover
We're lost in this love is where we are
