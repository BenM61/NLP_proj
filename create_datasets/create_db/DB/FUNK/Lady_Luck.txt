Oh, lady luck turned her back on me
Now I'm full of misery
There's only one thing left for me to do
Try not to think about you

I'm just as blue as a sad old song
Night and day everything go wrong
There's only one thing left for me to do
Try not to think about you

I'm just as blue as a sad old song
Night and day everything go wrong
There's only one thing left for me to do
Try not to think about you

Oh, oh, oh, over and over again
Come-a, come-a, come-a, come-a to me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, wee child
I've got to win your love somehow

Went to the river but I couldn't jump in
Now I know I just can't win
There's only one thing left for me to do
Is try not to think about you

Oh yeah, oh lady luck, oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, over and over now
Please a come-a, come-a, come-a to me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, wee child
I've got to win your love somehow

I went to the river but I couldn't jump in
Now I know I just can't win
There's only one thing left for me to do
Is try not to think about you
Oh yeah, oh lady luck
