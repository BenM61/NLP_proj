I want to (Diamond in the back) 
I want to (Sunroof top) 
I want to (Diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean) 
I want to (Diamond in the back) 
I want to (Sunroof top) 
I want to (Diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean) 
I want to (Diamond in the back)

And I want to (Sunroof top) 
I want to (Diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean) 

Diamond in the, diamond in the, diamond in the

It's hard growin' up lookin' at drug dealers wit' all this paper 
Wonderin' how I can get me some 
My family's strugglin', I'm buggin', sittin' on my porch 
So confused, chewin' on some bubblegum 
I was always taught to use my manners with the misses 
But please, stay away from the hoes and snithes 
And I was always reached for the sky, I don't know why 
I'ma little bitty kid wit' a whole bunch of gangsta wishes 
When I grow up, you just wait, I'ma be so straight 
And everything's gonna be so marvelous 
No more borrowin' from the neighbors, no more haters 
No more blowin' Nintendo cartridges 
I'ma have it made in the shade, I'ma be so paid 
And my fam, get 'em off that payin' them bills 
Matter fact I'm schemin' my way on up out this hood, I'll be good 
When I ditch these trainin' wheels 

I want to (Diamond in the back) 
I want to (Sunroof top) 
I want to (Diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean) 
I want to (Diamond in the back) 
I want to (Sunroof top) 
I want to (Diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean) 
I want to (Diamond in the back) 
I want to (Sunroof top) 
I want to (Diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean) 
I want to (Diamond in the back) 
And I want to (Sunroof top) 
I want to (Diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean) 

Diamond in the, diamond in the, diamond in the

I'm sick and tired of ridin' public transportation 
Been patient waitin' on my set of wheels 
I'm willin' to do what it takes, whatever the stakes 
In order to get myself some dollar bills 
It's too many holes in my socks, and I'm ready to box 
Anyone tellin' me I need better shoes 
And I ain't the only one trippin', or makin a fuss 
My older cousin need some cheddar too 
He thinkin' 'bout comin' up on the lick, to get it quick 
It involves that local corner store 
I overheard him say he knew who works there 
And whatever they do, don't let the owner know 
I hope he come back with enough to let me borrow some change 
At least for the summer 
And if he don't let me borrow nothing, but ask me what I want 
I'ma tell him I wanna

Why can't I walk with a limp mama? won't be no drama 
For goodness sakes, I'm just a kid 
Had to get my whoopin' in fo's, I was just a po' 
Like there no remorse for what I did 
Gotta learn the hard way, when runnin' them streets 
How some just creep, really just to eat a meal 
"I could of swore it was mine," what I used to tell the po-pos 
What I left to rob and steal 
Man, I gotta earn for a livin', ain't nobody givin' me nothin' 
Find somethin' I love to do 
Hmm, what about that pimpin'? It's good tippin' 
Tax free, and I know a lot of people that love to screw 
Yeah, it's just a way of the world, with boys and girls 
I'm adjustin' to my environment 
This government cheatin' us, so I'll cheat 'em back 
Why can't work feel like retirement?
