Look over yonder
What do you see?
The sun is a'rising
Most definitely

A new day is coming
Ooh ooh
People are changing
Ain't it beautiful
Crystal blue persuasion

Better get ready
To see the light
Love, love is the answer
Oooh ooh
And that's all right

So don't you give up now
So easy to find
Just look to your soul
And open your mind

Crystal blue persuasion
Mmm, mmm
It's a new vibration
Crystal blue persuasion
Crystal, blue persuasion

Maybe tomorrow
When he looks down
On every green field
And every town
All of his children
And every nation
They'll be peace and good brotherhood

Crystal blue persuasion
Yeah
Crystal blue persuasion
Aha
Crystal blue persuasion
Aha
Crystal blue persuasion
Aha
Ohhhh
Crystal blue persuasion
Aha
