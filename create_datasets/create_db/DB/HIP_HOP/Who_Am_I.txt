I've tried to wrap my mind around the thought of you
I stretched myself so far I nearly come unglued
You hold the universe inside your hands
Still you thought of me

I can't believe
Is there no limit to your love for me
As shallow as this selfish heart can be
You are the maker of reality

And I stand in awe
You are God

Who am I
To understand your ways
Who am I
To give you anything but praise
Who am I
To try and solve the mystery
Behind the heart and soul of all that I believe
Who am I

You're every reason for my heart to hope
Creator of the things I've yet to know
You are the river for my thirsty soul
You are my desire
You are God

Who am I
To understand your ways
Who am I
To give you anything but praise
Who am I
To try and solve the mystery
Behind the heart and soul of all that I believe
Who am I

I am your child
I will follow, who am I?
You gave your life
For my tomorrow

Who am I
To understand your ways
Who am I
To give you anything but praise
Who am I
To try and solve the mystery
Behind the heart and soul of all that I believe
Who am I
