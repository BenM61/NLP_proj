Hey now, hey now

I was walkin' up the street, actin' big and bold
But deep down in my pockets I had no gold
Was lookin' kinda sad when, before my eyes
Was a million-dollar bill that must've fell out the skies

I said hey now, hey now (hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now)
Hey now, hey now (hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now)

I took this million dolars and looked for more
Got halfway up the dock, and I took it real real slow
And much to my surprise I was knocked right out
When I met a little chick who knew what life was all about

I said hey now, hey now (hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now)
Hey now, hey now (hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now)

Hey now, hey now
Hey now, hey now

I've got the things that I want, plus a great big car (hey now, hey now)
And every day I'm getting more pop-u-lar (hey now, hey now)
So use these magic words that can see you through (hey now, hey now)
When you ain't got no gold, and don't know what to do (hey now, hey now)

Say hey now, hey now (hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now)
Hey now, hey now (hey now, hey now, hey now, well, hey now)
He-e-e-e-ey now
