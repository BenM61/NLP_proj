When you look at me
Tell me what do you see?
This is what you get 
It's the way I am
When I look at you
I want to be I want to be
Somewhere close to Heaven
With neanderthal man
Don't go
I know you want to touch me
Here there and everywhere
Sparks fly when we are together
You can't deny the facts of life

You don't have to act like a snob
Try your moves in the back of a car
Don't you know that we can go far
'Cause tonight you're gonna get my
(Mwaa mwaa)
Don't play the games that you play
You know that I won't run away
Why're you askin' me to stay
'Cause tonight you're gonna get my
(Mwaa mwaa)
Kiss kiss

You can be mine
Baby what's your starsign
Won't you take a step
Into the lion's den
I can here my conscience calling me
Calling me
Say I'm gonna be a bad girl again
Why don't you come on over
We can't leave this all undone
Got the devil on my shoulder
There's no place for you to run

You don't have to act like a snob
Try your moves in the back of a car
Don't you know that we can go far
'Cause tonight you're gonna get my
(Mwaa mwaa)
Don't play the games that you play
You know that I won't run away
Why're you askin' me to stay
'Cause tonight I'm gonna get my
(Mwaa mwaa)

If you forget
I'll remind you
If you're paranoid
I'm behind you
You lose your head
I'll find you
Giving you my kiss

If you forget
I'll remind you
If you're paranoid
I'm behind you
You lose your head
I'll find you
Kiss kiss

You don't have to act like a snob
