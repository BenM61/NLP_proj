Cold chills, my baby makes cold chills go all over me
Cold chills, cold chills goes all over me
Every time I lay my hand on her brown body
Cold chills goes all over me

Baby, I say please don't run around
Baby, please don't stay out all night long
Baby, please don't run around
Baby, please don't stay out all night long

When you come home I'll be there
And you know that word

My baby went out last night, my baby got drunk
That's one thing, god knows, I just can't stand
She makes cold chills
She make cold chills go out all over me

Every time you go out and get drunk
It makes cold chills go all over me

I got drunk last night, baby
I got drunk to keep from cryin'
Lord, I got drunk last night, baby
I got drunk to keep from cryin'

You didn't come home last night, baby
And that lasted four days
