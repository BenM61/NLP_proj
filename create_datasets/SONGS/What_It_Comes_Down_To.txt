Here I am loving you, you're like a dream come true
For so long I've waited for this time
Girl what you mean to me, in reality, is more than I ever hoped for
You will always be, more than right for me, each day I love you more

Well what it comes down to, this is all I want from you
Same as you want from me; that can only be
Love and understanding
For what we have at stake, a little give and take
It's better than demanding

Why do we stay together, talking about you and me,
You got your reasons, I got mine
Oh, if it had to be, one and only me, sure would be a drag now,
Need somebody who, needs somebody to, keep from being sad now

Well what it comes down to, this is all I want from you
Same as you want from me; that can only be
Love and understanding
For what we have at stake, a little give and take
It's better than demanding
