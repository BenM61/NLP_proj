I feel the spirit
Of the great sisters
Calling on me to sing
This is the learning

Of the great story
I'll tell you about this place
From the edge of the mountains
Fly down the valley

Down where the Snowy River flows
Follow the water
Down to the ocean
Bring back the memory

This is a timeless land
This is our land...
Just like the wise man
Who taught me the beauty

Of the creation times
The point where the mountain
Meets with the sky
Sparks a fire within my sould

Watching Mother Nature around me
Woman, creators, history
Finding these people Up in the mountain
Sharing the same old song

This is a timeless land
This is our land...
This is a timeless land
This is our land...
