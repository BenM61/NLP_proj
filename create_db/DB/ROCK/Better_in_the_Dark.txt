I don't know your name
But I'll kiss you just the same
Holding hands, that's a start
'Cause you'd look better in the dark

So turn the lights down, turn them down
So turn the lights down, turn them down
Won't you come and spend some time with me?

Come on boy there's no shame
'Cause I know how to play the game
First a drink then a laugh
'Cause I'd look better in the dark

So turn the lights down, turn them down
So turn the lights down, turn them down
Won't you come and spend some time with me?

Come on boy there's no shame
'Cause I know how to play the game
First a drink then a laugh
'Cause I'd look better in the dark

So turn the lights down, turn them down
So turn the lights down, turn them down
Won't you come and spend some time with me?

You look better
I look better
They look better
We all look better in the dark
