Every morning on every news flash
I hear the sorrow of the world
It seems like everybody's lost and
Scared trying to make sense of it all
And as I travel to and fro, so many faces pass me by
I see lonely hearts living lonely lives just biding their time
And while we call ourselves civilized, many people living empty lives
As they drone their way through day and night

I pray for our world, I pray for every child
I pray for our world to be filled with smiles
Like the colors of a rainbow and not just black and white
I pray for our world to be filled with light
I pray for all of us, to choose the path that's right
To believe in Allah every day of our lives 

In the evening on the TV news, I see images of war
I see brother killing brother with no consequence at all
And while those who claim to be leaders, sell us tales of deceit
But Allah alone know in their hearts what they reveal and conceal
And while we call ourselves civilized
We go on killing human lives
Too caught up in our own web of lies

I pray for our world, I pray for every child
I pray for our world to be filled with smiles
Like the colors of a rainbow and not just black and white
I pray for our world to be filled with light
I pray for all of us, to choose the path that's right
To believe in Allah every day of our lives 

Every mother, every father, every daughter, every son
Don't you see, that the answer lies only with the one
