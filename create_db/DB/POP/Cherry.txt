Cherry
Tells me some things I don't want to know
And I can't see
A light at the end for us anymore

But I can't keep crying
All of the time
No, I can't keep crying
All of the time

Cherry
Can be very sweet when she needs a friend
But it's only
A mask that she wears so she can pretend

And I can't keep running
All of the time
No, I can't keep running
All of the time

Cherry
I hate that it's true but you make me blue
I kept waiting
For you to find what I see in you

And I can't keep quiet
All of the time
No, I can't keep quiet
All of the time
