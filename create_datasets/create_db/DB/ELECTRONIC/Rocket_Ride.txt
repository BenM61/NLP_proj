Hey boy, take me off the radar
People said we'd never go far
Look at you, so take me away from him
Turbo boost me into your stratosphere
Looking fine, got you in my sight
I surrender, won't put up a fight
You're my darling, I adore you
I'll stand by you, always be true

Spaced up kid, won't you take me on a rocket ride?
Don't say no cause I won't be denied
You're my boy and I'm your girl
Take me out of this messed up world

Out the window, there's the tiny earth
In your arms, I know what I'm worth
You and I, love in outer space
here with you, a perfect dream place
Far away, the distant earth lies
Yours forever, silent space wife
Energize my inner fantasy
Go whatever this craft takes me

Spaced up kid, won't you take me on a rocket ride?
Don't say no cause I won't be denied
You're my boy and I'm your girl
Take me out of this messed up world

Trans centers all static
Together by electric fate
I'm a solar power princess
your technological soul mate
emotion at the speed of light
Jet fueled warship
A lusty in the red
Of a digital relationship

Spaced up kid, won't you take me on a rocket ride?
Don't say no cause I won't be denied
You're my boy and I'm your girl
Take me out of this messed up world

Spaced up kid, won't you take me on a rocket ride?
Don't say no cause I won't be denied
You're my boy and I'm your girl
Take me out of this messed up world

Spaced up kid, won't you take me on a rocket ride?
Don't say no cause I won't be denied
You're my boy and I'm your girl
Take me out of this messed up world

Spaced up kid, won't you take me on a rocket ride?
Don't say no cause I won't be denied
You're my boy and I'm your girl
Take me out of this messed up world

Spaced up kid, won't you take me on a rocket ride?
Don't say no cause I won't be denied
You're my boy and I'm your girl
Take me out of this messed up world
