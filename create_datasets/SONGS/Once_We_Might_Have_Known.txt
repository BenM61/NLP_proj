I'm afraid that this is all new to me
We barely struck the tip of the ice
The world is full of missed opportunities
Ask yourself what you feel inside

The trouble with you is the trouble with me
Both of us thinking we're on our own
If love's just a dream of what together we can be
Well maybe
Once we might have known
Once we might have known

Seems somehow that we still could save our love
Lately I've been asking why
I know the odds are not in favor of
But we hardly gave it a try

The trouble with you is the trouble with me
We like to keep movin' from home to home
The fact that I had you, and we could have been happy
Once we might have known
Once we might have known

I'm afraid that this is all new to me
Seems somehow that we still could save our love
There's just a few good things youdon't know about me yet
There's just a few good things you don' know about me girl
Like the fact that we could have been happy now
Just talking to each other like we used to do
Is this not a golden opportunity we might be losin'?
I said lately, said lately
We keep movin', movin', home to home, home to home, home to
I keep asking why?

The trouble with you is the trouble with me
Each leaving places that we've outgrown
If all that you've taken seems like nothing you need
Baby
Once we might have known
Once we might have known
