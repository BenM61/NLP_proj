I like to slip into something good
I see a young girl in the neighborhood
The way she move, I must confess
I like to run my hands up and down her legs
The way she dress, she look so fine
I'll make her wet, I'll make her mine        [Gonna make her mine]
She like it hard, she like it slow           [She don't like it slow]
All right honey, come on lets go          

Baby, what you want, it's the way she move   [Baby, feel what you want]
Feel what you need, come on let's go         [Baby, feel what you need]

Pull on the zip, she give good lip service
It's nothing for the show, I just pay to see her go
She make you hot, you spray your lot
[So] Comin' in honey, we're headin' to the top
The way she push, don't give a dime          [she don't give a dime]
Abuse your life, gonna make you satisfied
She's kinda rough, she give it tough
Come on honey and strut your stuff
