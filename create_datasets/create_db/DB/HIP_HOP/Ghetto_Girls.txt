Like when Janet was justic that's what I am talking about 
A shorty that can tell you when the J's come out 
Get creative with they haircuts like T-boz 
Fav'rite rappers is Bow Wow, Snoop, JD, & Nas 
Always up in they somebody's face trying to fuss 
And to get where she going she can take the bus 
Like when Jada was Peaches in the movie Shame 
Or the type you can find sitting at a Ruckers game
Only like dealing with cats that love to floss 
Only like rocking the stuff that really costs
Lip gloss shinnis' tattoos on her back 
Attitude like Mary J. Mixed with Brat 
You can find a man at a beauty shop, mall, or church
Name brand head to toe with the matching purse
So all that siddity stuff, ya'll can keep 
Cause only girls that keep it ghetto get to ride with me (fo' sho) 

Ghetto Girls 
That like hot boys that push hot toys
And ball wit the best of them 
Ghetto girls that rock braids in different shades
And in the kitchen fixing up the bomb Kool-aid
Ghetto girls that think they can hang
And talk more slang
Than I do
Ghetto girls that's all I like so tell me baby is that you

When they ride with they man like you won't believe
Switch the color on there hair like Eve
When they talk like I talk but walk like a lady 
Snap lile I snap and get a little crazy
I love that especially when they bout the cheese
Type that won't front for some Mickey D's 
Bandannas to barrets daisy dukes to spandex all that's good with me 
I like em' G-H-E-T-T-O now believe me she got's to go
At the corner store buying up all the sweets
From Choo Choo's to Rice Krispy Treats on my street 
That's all I see like everyday 
And they do what they do in a crazy way
Hang with the ballers so they never pay
And they usually got a name that's hard to say (ya heard) 

Ghetto Girls 
That like hot boys that push hot toys
And ball wit the best of them 
Ghetto girls that rock braids in different shades
And in the kitchen fixen up the bomb Kool-aid
Ghetto girls that think they can hang
And talk more slang
Than I do
Ghetto girls that's all I like so tell me baby is that you

Lets talk about it now 
If ya know what I mean
Shawty let yourself be seen (ya Heard) 
Lets talk about it now 
If ya know what I mean
Shawty let yourself be seen 
Uh,uh
