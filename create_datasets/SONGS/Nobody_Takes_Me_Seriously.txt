Nobody listens to a word that I say
And at work I'm just a foremans tool
Sitting in the corner with my coffee & tray
All the secretaries think I'm a fool

I don't want to suffer these conditions no more
Haven't I the right to say
I don't want to suffer these conditions no more
Nobody takes me seriously anyway
Nobody takes me seriously anyway
Nobody takes me seriously anyway

Loves not a glimpse, it's a permanent rinse
And it keeps you on your toes all day
Every girl I met seemed to get apathetic
When I looked at her that special way

I can't get nobody else to take me for real
They like to keep me tucked away
Even if they listened to what I had to say
Nobody'd take me seriously anyway
Nobody takes me seriously anyway
Nobody takes me seriously anyway

If war broke out I'd be the last one to know
If there was a fire they'd just leave me to burn
I got just as much to say as any man
But I never seem to get my turn

I don't want to suffer these conditions no more
Haven't I the right to say
I don't want to suffer these conditions no more
Nobody takes me seriously anyway
Nobody takes me seriously anyway
Nobody takes me seriously anyway

(Nobody takes me seriously)
Nobody... no, no, no-nobody...
