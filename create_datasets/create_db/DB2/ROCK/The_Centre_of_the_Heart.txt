You wear them so well, those innocent eyes
You're puttin' on a wonderful disguise
I want you so bad. I'm pushing my luck
It feels like being hit by a truck
This is no place special. don't know why I came
If someone has a minute, won't you explain

Being with you, dealing with fire
Oh won't you come around (come out)
Come out (today) and play

Answer my calls
Let's spend the night within these walls
This is no place special.
Nothing for the sane (nothing for the sane)
If someone's got minute, do please explain
