I said I'm living in a lost generation
I said I'm living in a lost generation
I've got my heart

I'm living, I'm living, I'm living life man

Switch on the TV, they keep it real, but not in that way
I turn the channel and just see somebody's life displayed
Awkward pauses and dodgy moments I smile it keeps me sane
Reality TV is morphine give me that now, let me ease the pain
(Oh yeah) Man, talent shows I seen some of our friends, go and beat their targets
I've also seen careers end when they ain't even really started
Jeremy Kyle got the nation laughing at the other people's expense
Somebody tell that guy that we hate him too we are not his friends yeah
