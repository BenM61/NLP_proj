The candles whisper, 
The shadows outline that you're right on time for the very first time...
You can't conceal that look, 
The one I couldn't ignore,
Your look this evening was meant to deny...
The black and white's on the wall,
Our future there in Doisneau,
My pocket is heavy with diamonds tonight...
But they won't shine on your hand,
And what I thought were our plans flicker out with goodbye...

Am I the last to know?

Your eyes are cold but my tears are warm,
Why do people like you hurt people like me?
You blind your fear with your pride, 
Protect the woman inside,
I know you know how true it can be...
But you're afraid of the need, 
Can't risk the imminent bleed,
What is love but the greatest of dangers...
And now the songs are a lie,
I never dreamed you would cry in a bed of a stranger...

Am I the last to know?

And in the shuddered rush, I will fall...
And in the tumbling I see it all...
A hushed release of you, and I'm free, and alive, and my heart, is the
Last...

Am I the Last to know?
