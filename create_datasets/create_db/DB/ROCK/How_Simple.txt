I suppose one, one, one who hasn't seen
Earlier fames
Could say I am advancing up this road
I am advancing

Pale as a banshee sun
Think I should stop checking myself out
In the windows of cars
When I could see my future in her pictures of relatives

How simple my heart can be
How simple my heart can be
Frightens me

Don't worry we will both find out
Just not together
Don't worry we will both find out
Just not together

Your hand was on me
It seemed like you were being sweet
Here I am again
At the reserve to drink

It's not that I thought
Like all of a sudden you change
We were covered in each other's snot
In my childhood bed
Well it seemed like we were being sweet
Her pictures of relatives

How simple my heart can be
How simple my heart can be
Frightens me, oh oh oh oh oh
