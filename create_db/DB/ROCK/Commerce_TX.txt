I got a bad flavor
I got dirty clothes
I got a strange neighbor
Who doesn't have curtains on her windows

I got a pet hedgehog
Drinkin' Jaeger all day
You got me crate combo and a baby on the way
But it's ok

It's gonna take a lot of time
Before i can cross that finish line
And when i can't take the fall
I really want to make that call

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ah ah ah

That's my new best friend
Ann disaster's her name
We're passin' out on the carpet
And our attributes are the same

It's the slacker lifestyle
That we do so well
Bills are due on Monday
I'm oblivious, can't you tell

It's gonna take a lot of time
Before i can cross that finish line
And when i can't take the fall
I really want to make that call

My brain is super-fried
It involves pain to look inside

It's gonna take a lot of time
Before i can cross that finish line
And when i can't take the fall
I really want to make that call
