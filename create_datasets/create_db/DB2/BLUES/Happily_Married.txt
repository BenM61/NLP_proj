We are so happily married
We gave up all for love
And now we are free

It's so heavenly
We wish everyone to know
It's robins and roses
Whenever we go, oh, oh, ooh, oh

We sacrificed
And paid the price, together
We made a vow to be the same
Forever, ever and ever

Oh, we are so happily started
And never to part again
To be gay to the end
Mmm, mm, mmm, yeah

Uh huh

Come on up ladies and gentlemen

Oh, we are so happily married, yeah
We gave up all for love
And now we are free
Yes

It's so heavenly
We wish everyone to know
It's robins and roses
Ever, ever we go

We sacrificed and paid the price, together
We made a vow to be the same
Forever, ever and ever

Whoa, we are so happily started
And never to part again
We'll be gay to the end
Yas
