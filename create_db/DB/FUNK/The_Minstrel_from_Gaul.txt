A minstrel came down from Gaul, with scores of tales to tell. 
Some of them were true and some were false and some we knew too well. 
It was told in fire, it was told in ice, 
It was told a million times though it need not be told twice. 

A soldier came down from Diem Ben Phu, with silence in his eyes. 
He told of many an evening when fire was the sky. 
He told of many a morning when the bravest of men would cry, 
Knowing, through Satan's earthbound magic, many more would have to die, 
Many more would have to die. 

A man came down from Sinai Mountain, with words of truth for us all. 
How we bowed and knelt down, 
How we worshipped well. 
And when it came to listening, 
We listened little, if at all, 
If at all.
