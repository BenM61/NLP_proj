You always were the special one
The breath of air, the heap of fun
You always had a kind of light
That might dismay, or might delight

I thought about tall along
I used to doubt you
Guess I was wrong

Now you shine like chrome
You're a star and bold like chrome
And from Tokyo to Rome
We're all aware of you
Now you shine like chrome
Your so hard and cold like chrome
And I'd like to take you home
But I'm scared of you

It's nice to see you looking well
I know your age but I won't tell
You always had a kind of glow
You're luminous
But I guess you know

I see it clearly
You're gonna shine
I never really thought you'd be mine

Now you shine like chrome
You're a star and bold like chrome
And from Tokyo to Rome
We're all aware of you
Now you shine like chrome
Your so hard and cold like chrome
And I'd like to take you home
But I'm scared of you
