Doo doo doo doo doo doo 
Whoa, oh, oh, whoa 
Ho, ho,  

Hey, there mister 
So it seems again we meet 
The first we met it was crazy 
You swept me off my feet 

I still imagine your lips, boy 
Kissin' me here and there 
Ooh, and if my hands could touch your body 
They'd caress you everywhere 

I want you to love me down, oh 
Let's go for what we know 
Hold me so tight 
Then love me some more 

Oh, oh, whoa, fine, fine fella 
Where do I begin 
I guess I should start by tellin' you, sugar 
That you're the perfect 10 

Let's find a nice warm cabin 
Way up on some hill 
Then you and I will close up the world around us 
And do the things we feel 

Won't you come on, boy and love me down, yeah 
And let's go for what we know 
Hold me so tight 
And then love me some more, oh, oh, oh 

Love me down, yeah 
And let's go for what we know, ho, ho 
Hold me so tight, yeah 
And then love me some more, more 

Ooh, never before have I felt this way 
And how I feel about you is crazy I must say 
But one thing's for sure, I know it feels good 
So come on love me, boy, oh, I wish you would 

Boy,  
This must be my lucky day 
And I'm so glad the wind that blew you in 
Was heading my way 

Oh, come on, boy and love me down, yeah 
And let's go for what we know 
Hold me so tight, yeah 
And then love me, love me, love me down 

(Love me down) 
I go crazy when you love me, baby 
(Love me down) 
I go crazy when you love me, baby 

(Love me down) 
Ooh, love me down, baby, yeah 
(Love me down) 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, make me feel good 

(Love me down) 
Ooh, love me down, down, down, down
