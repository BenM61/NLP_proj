S-O-L-O, S-T-A-are that's how I roll
Solo Star's keep rocking don't follow nobody's lead, lead
S-O-L-O, S-T-A-are that's how I roll.
Starting my own style and I'm takin' it to the streets, streets

We'll I hate seeing people
Rock, the same style
At, the same time
They think, that it is fly
But yo you really need to know
Yo it's better to be solo
You'll never catch me with something you have up in your wardrobe

I'm solo, I got do my own thing
Solo, ya'll may not understand me
Solo, I'm dancin' to a different drummer
Solo, ya'll really don't want none, come on!

S-O-L-O, S-T-A-are that's how I roll
Solo Star's keep rocking don't follow nobody's lead, lead
S-O-L-O, S-T-A-are that's how I roll.
Starting my own style and I'm takin' it to the streets, streets

From my head to my socks
Down to, my cell phone
I rock, it solo
And to think, ya'll don't know
So look like twins in Versace, BC, BG, Gucci, Viddi
Yeah I like it, but don't buy it
'Cause ya'll wear it and it ain't for me

I'm solo, I got to do my own thing
Solo, ya'll may not understand me
Solo, I'm dancin' to a different drummer
Solo, ya'll really don't want none, come on!

S-O-L-O, S-T-A-are that's how I roll
Solo Star's keep rocking don't follow nobody's lead, lead
S-O-L-O, S-T-A-are that's how I roll.
Starting my own style and I'm takin' it to the streets, streets

Dance dance
S-O-L-O S-T-A-are
S-O-L-O S-T-A-are is solo solo solo solo
S-O-L-O S-T-A-are
S-O-L-O S-T-A-are is solo star!

S-O-L-O, S-T-A-are that's how I roll
Solo Star's keep rocking don't follow nobody's lead, lead
S-O-L-O, S-T-A-are that's how I roll.
Starting my own style and I'm takin' it to the streets, streets
