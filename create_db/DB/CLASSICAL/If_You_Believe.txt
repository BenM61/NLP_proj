I close my eyes,
And even when I'm sleeping
I'm alright,
'Cause You were, in my life.
 
Once upon a time,
I only imagined this
And now You're mine.
Wished for you so hard
Prayed that You'd find me
Maybe your here today
Here to remind me
 
If you believe that dreams come true,
There's One that's waiting there for you.
'Cause I believed when I saw You
That when you want something enough
That it can't escape Your love.
There is nothing in the world that cannot be
If you believe, oh oh

Everybody said
That I was a fool to think
That we'd connect
But I couldn't get my heart out of my head
And they just didn't see
No, they just couldnt know
The feeling that You get
The places that You go

If you believe that dreams come true,
There's One that's waiting there for you.
'Cause I believed when I saw You
That when you want something enough
Thren it can't escape Your love
There is nothing in the world that cannot be
If you believe
 
Never wished for material things
Never needed wind in my wings
I never wished for anything but You, oh!
I can't explain it
Someone just told me
"Go where your heart is
You'll never be lonely."
 
If you believe that dreams come true,
There's One that's waiting there for you
'Cause I believed when I saw You
That (when you believe) when You want Someone enough
Then they can't escape Your love
There is nothing in the world that cannot be
If you believe.
Believe, believe, believe, ooh
