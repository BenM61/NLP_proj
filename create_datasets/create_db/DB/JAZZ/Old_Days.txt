Old days
Good times I remember
Fun days
Filled with ship of pleasure

Drive-in movies
Comic books and blue jeans
Howdy Doody
Baseball cards and birthdays

Take me back
To the world gone away
Memories
Seem like yesterday

Oh, old days
Good times I remember
Gold days
Days I'll always treasure

Funny faces
Full of love and laughter
Funny places
Summer nights and streetcars

Take me back
To the world gone away
Our good memories
Seem like yesterday
Old days

Ah, ah, ah
Old days 
Ah, ah, ah
Old days
Ah, ah, ah
Old days
Ah, ah, ah
Old days
Ah, ah, ah
Old days
Ah, ah, ah
Old days
