Oh Condi Condi beggin' on my knees 
Open up your heart and let me in wontcha please 
Got no money but everybody knows 
I love you Condi and I'll never let you go 
Sweet and dandy pretty as can be 
You be the flower and I'll be the bumble bee 
Oh she loves me oops she loves me not 
People say you're cold but I think you're hot 

Oh, Condi, Condi 
Oh, Condi, Condi 

Oh Condi, Condi I'm talkin' to you girl 
What's it gonna hurt come on give me a whirl 
Shake your body now let me see you go 
One time for me Oh Condi I love you so 
Skank for me Condi show me what you got 
They say you're too uptight I say you're not 
Dance around me spinnin' like a top 
Oh Condi Condi Condi don't ever stop 

Oh Condi Condi Can't you hear me call 
I'm standin' in the street outside your garden wall 
Pocketful of money belly full of wine 
Condi in my heart and romance on my mind 
Listen to me Condi don't be afraid 
I come here tonight to chase your blues away 
I'll never hurt you I'll treat you right 
Oh Condaleeza won't you come out tonight 

Pretty little Condi precious as can be 
Bet you never had another lover like me
