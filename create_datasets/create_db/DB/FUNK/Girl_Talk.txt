They like to chat about the dresses they will wear tonight
They chew the fat about their tresses and the neighbours' fight
Inconsequential things that men don't really care to know
Become essential things that women find so apropos

But that's a dame
They're all the same
It's just a game
They call it girl talk, girl talk

They all me-ouw about the ups and downs of all their friends
The who, the how, the why, they dish the dirt, it never ends
The weaker sex, the speaker sex, we mortal males behold
But though we joke, we wouldn't trade you for a ton of gold

So baby stay, and gab away
But hear me say
That after girl talk
Talk to me

Talk to me
