**Intro**
Oh baby, you're the finest, the finest, i've seen,
Oh baby, you're the finest, the finest, i've seen,
Oh baby, you're the finest, the finest, i've seen,
Oh baby, you're the finest, the finest, i've seen,

**Verse 1**
If i had a choice,
I'd always choose love,
Up or down,
???
I don't mind,
Just as long as it's real,
My friends say i'm lucky,
To have found someone as good as you,
My love's understanding,
Understanding how to hold onto you,

**Chorus**
After all that we've been through,
Time won't change the way i feel about you,
Out of all the love before,
You're the finest i've ever known, 
After all that we've been through, (we've been through)
Time won't change the way i feel about you,
Out of all the love before, (love before)
You're the finest i've ever known,

Baby, you're the finest,
I've never met anybody like you,
You can call me,
I'll come on and... (just call me)

**Verse 2**
If i had to choose,
I'd be by myself,
I want to be in love,
Or with nobody else,
Time flies when you're with me,
Goes so slow whenever you're away,
Made up my mind and i'm positive,
I thought love would never come my way,

**Chorus**
After all that we've been through, (we've been through)
Time won't change the way i feel about you,
Out of all the love before, (love before)
You're the finest i've ever known,
After all that we've been through, (we've been through)
Time won't change the way i feel about you,
Out of all the love before, (love before)
You're the finest i've ever known
