Oooh, yeah

It was right
Even though it felt wrong
Nothin' ever stopped you
From showin' your progression suddenly

Broken lies
Drivin' backwards
Makin' all the wrong turns
Sayin' all the wrong words
Dodgin' angels

Oh, let's not be alone
Let's not be alone
Let's be one
Oh, let's not be alone
Empty thoughts fill the room
Breathe for me and I'll breathe for you

Let's be selfish tonight, tonight (selfish, baby tonight)
Let's be selfish, tonight, tonight (selfish, baby tonight)
Yeah, yeah

I just hit the lick, south of France
Currency exchange, lookin' fancy
If that money dirty, make it dance
25 karats cost a mansion
Gold rose petals, bottle standin'
Came from the concrete, takin' chances
Pop gold Ace like a Xanny
I just need the blessin' from your family
Broken lies, ain't no love without us
It will die, roses turn into dust
Every night, we gettin' more popular
Wrong is right, when it comes to us

Oh, let's not be alone
Let's not be alone
Tonight, yeah

Let's be selfish tonight, tonight (selfish, baby tonight)
Let's be selfish tonight, tonight (selfish, baby tonight)
Yeah, yeah

I'll be selfish
Let's be selfish
Ohh, ohh
(Yeah, yeah)
Oh, oh oh oh
I'll be selfish
Let's be selfish
Let's be
Let's be selfish
(Yeah, yeah)
