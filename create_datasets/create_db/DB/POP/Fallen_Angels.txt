Fallen Angels 
Fallen Angels 

I got a man in the business line 
He power hungry, he's a money mine 
Smooth as satin he's a big time shark 
Fallen Angel 
I got a brother, oo he mean as sin 
He got a brother who's just like him 
Livin' over in Moscow, 2 of a kind. 
How come the great power got the junkie mind 
Fallen Angels 
They never get enough 
Fallen Angels oo oo 
They got the addictions 
Fallen Angels 
They litter the skies 
Fallen Angels 
Don't you wanna turn 'em around 
Turn 'em around

I got a man in the USA 
He runnin' guns with the CIA 
He's the best that being bad can be 
Who'd think he do it all for me 
What's it matter if you're green or red 
The Yankee dollar or the commie threat 
When the real power in the real world 
Gonna deny it all anyway 
Fallen Angels 
They never get enough 
Fallen Angels oo oo 
They got the addictions 
Fallen Angels 
They litter the skies 
Fallen Angels 
Don't you wanna turn 'em around 
Turn 'em around

You believe in the system from the top on down 
Potential is a beautiful thing 
It's hard to keep believing in the big time 
Now you're sinking in the wind 
Star light, star bright 
Somebody going down tonight 
Told the truth when it was time to lie 
Got it right 
Fallen Angels 
They never gel enough 
Fallen Angels hoo hoo 
They got the addictions 
Fallen Angels 
They litter the skies 
Fallen Angels 
Don't you wanna turn 'em around 
Turn 'em around

Fallen Angels 
They never gel enough 
Fallen Angels hoo hoo 
They got the addictions 
Fallen Angels
