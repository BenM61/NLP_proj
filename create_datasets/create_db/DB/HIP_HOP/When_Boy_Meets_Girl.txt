Baby I can't figure it out,
Your kiss is just like honey.
Baby I can't figure it out,
Your kiss is just like honey.
 
You can't deny what you feel for me,
Baby, baby, baby, baby.
See love comes once so let's take it babe,
Baby, baby.
 
Tell me baby, 
If I need you you're here with me.
Show me baby,
That the love we share is real.
So...

You can't deny what you feel for me,
Baby, baby, baby, baby.
See love comes once so let's take it babe,
Baby, baby.
 
I need you baby,
Let me show you the way to my heart.
Trust me baby,
And so I won't let you go away.
 
You said that love was too confusing,
But see I'm so relaxed I will let it lead the way.
Uncontrollably no one can refuse it,
See I've got to have that loving once again.

You can't deny what you feel for me,
Baby, baby, baby, baby.
See love comes once so let's take it babe,
Baby, baby.
You can't deny what you feel for me,
Baby, baby, baby, baby.
See love comes once so let's take it babe,
Baby, baby.

You said that love was too confusing,

Baby, baby, baby, baby.
See love comes once so let's take it babe,

If loving you is wrong,
I don't want to be right now baby 
If loving you is wrong,
I don't want to be right now baby
