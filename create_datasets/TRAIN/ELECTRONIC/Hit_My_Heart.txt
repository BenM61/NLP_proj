Hey
Hit my heart

Are you gonna hit my heart
Are you gonna leave me once again
Baby don't you hit my heart

Are you gonna break my heart
Are you gonna make me cry again
Baby don't you break my heart

Hey, boy it's not a game
You are the one to blame
My love is not your toy
You better be careful boy

You told a million lies to me
One day you said goodbye baby
I gave you one more chance
So be still be baby

Are you gonna hit my heart
Are you gonna leave me once again
Baby don't you hit my heart

Are you gonna break my heart
Are you gonna make me cry again
Baby don't you break my heart
