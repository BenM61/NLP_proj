Watching the rain fall in Vienna
Pictures of another time
From the corner of a small cafe
We watched the world go by

Now we sit here the best of strangers
We played the game for all it's worth
Endless nights in Vienna's eyes
Take me back again

'Cause in Vienna- we were poetry
Yes, in Vienna- love was alive
Watching you watching me
All that our eyes could see
All of the nights
We chased into the dawn
It was the best time of my life

We can't surrender to a feeling
That dance belongs to yesterday
Yet, I still hear Vienna's song
Take me back again 'Cause in Vienna- we were poetry
Yes, in Vienna- love was alive
Watching you watching me
All that our eyes could see
All of the nights
We chased into the dawn
It was the best time of my life

'Cause in Vienna- we were poetry
Yes, in Vienna- love was alive
Watching you watching me
All that our eyes could see
All of the nights
We chased into the dawn
It was the best time of my life
