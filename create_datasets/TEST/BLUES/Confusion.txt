Confusion, baby (confusion) 
(Confusion, baby, confusion) 
Confusion, baby (confusion) 
Heaven help a man who is confused as I 
She keeps me guessin', oh me oh my 
(One day I'm happy, next day I'm blue) 
Confusion, baby, I don't know what to do 
I don't know if I'm goin' or comin' 
I just don't understand this woman 
Confusion, baby (confusion) 
Won't be the man that has peace of mind 
Won't be the fool like me runnin' all the time 
(I should feel blessed for bringin' back you) 
Confusion, baby, I'm so confused 
I don't know if I'm goin' or comin' 
I just don't understand this woman 
Confusion, baby (confusion)
