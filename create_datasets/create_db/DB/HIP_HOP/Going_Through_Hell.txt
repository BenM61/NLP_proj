It's not the size of the dog in the fight,
But the fight and the dog!
Let's surprise and take a ?
And if you get a knife from behind there,
? any funny!
Do it, do it!
I won't say a word till I ? in your shoes...
Very nice new shoes!
Do it, do it!

If you're going through hell!
If you're going through hell!
If you're going through hell!
If you're going through hell!
Keep going!

Fall down five times,
Rise up six!
Keep the good news,
By all means,
The main streets are in a fight to win
This is right and both sides win!
Yeah! What's the name
Round the ring around your finger
And build the ring around to bring it, bring it!

If you're going through hell!
If you're going through hell!
If you're going through hell!
If you're going through hell!
Keep going!

If you can't join them, beat them!
If you want, ? be friends!
The joy of the fight is the fight and the boy
I'm making this up now finding a point.
Is he even comprende,
? is the fun of the thing,

I can't resist anything,
For temptation ?
I'm finding myself!

In here is only ordinary,
Is the hero among the ordinarily.
You have nothing to lose but your chains,
So we might ?
And yet might be ?
Or a ?
Do it!
Do it!
At the end of the tunnel, there is always light,
It just might be a train.
Is it?

If you're going through hell!
If you're going through hell!
If you're going through hell!
If you're going through hell!
Keep going!
