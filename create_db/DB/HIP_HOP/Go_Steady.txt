 

(Sara)
When I'm with you, you make me feel so sexy, ooh
Made up my mind, I agree that we are ready
(I'm so ready) On a steady pace for love
Ready'and I'm ready'for love
So do you boy'do you want a taste'

[VERSE 1]
What I see when I look at you
A rugged dude, but a gentleman too
With your hat tilted to the side
I get a chill from those pretty brown eyes
Rippled chest and how you dress
I'm so impressed, can't get you off my mind
I'm so excited, can't wait to be with you tonight

[HOOK]
So can we hook up around 8 so
Try not to be late boy (It's on)
I got so much in store for you
Tell ya boys bye, it's about time
Gonna make it hotter than July
And make it worth your wait and I
I like it when you say, 'Don't be shy'

[CHORUS]
When I'm with you, you make me feel so sexy, ooh
Made up my mind, I agree that we are ready
(Ready for love) On a steady pace for love

[VERSE 2]
Dim the lights, I turn my two-way off and close the door
I'm in the mood for more
Bring it here, I want to take you there
Ooh boy I swear no one compares
(To this love) Love makin', breath takin', body shakin, no fakin'
You're really somethin', can't wait to be with you again

[HOOK]
So can we hook up around 8 so
Try not to be late boy (It's on)
I got so much in store for you
Tell ya boys bye, it's about time
Gonna make it hotter than July
And make it worth your wait and I
I like it when you say, 'Don't be shy'

[CHORUS]
When I'm with you, you make me feel so sexy, ooh
Made up my mind, I agree that we are ready
(For love) On a steady pace for love

[BRIDGE]
No more waiting, contemplating
'cause I know it's love
I'm so anxious to start makin'
Goin' steady now
Go 'head boy, tear it up

(Ness Rap)
Look playa'I admit it was a game I played
But now I see things different, girl you changed my ways
You never know you got good fate''till it's gone
Now you feel you bein' hoodwinked'now it's on
Listen'you never told me you ain't want me to grissle 'cause I
Kept you hot and now it's somethin' official
You kept a pistol in ya pocket but the government issue
Look I'seen too much to tell you I miss you
Or tell you I love you, all day kissin' and huggin'
Listen'bottom line if I ain't wit you I'm fuckin' I never
Fucked wit ya sister, never fucked wit ya cousin, no fussin' and fightin'
Tonight, we under the covers tusslin'
Paradise where the water is blue and grab a snack 'round a quarter to 2
Me and boo hoo'and I ain't gotta give you Extacy
For you to want to have sex wit me, that's my specialty

[CHORUS 2x]
When I'm with you, you make me feel so sexy, ooh
Made up my mind, I agree that we are ready
On a steady pace for love
