And it's the ham
'Cause the beats is so fresh
It's like I'm rippin apart the rest
But they try never the less
It's like everybody wants a piece
Of the big apple pie
But they haven't the heart 
It's like do or die 
You've got have the shit
Never let them make you quit
Rule number 1 is that you're 
Not to give a shit
About every damn body that 
Now wants to cut you down 
Even though you're broke and 
Still livin' in funky town
And free shit is cool no
Don't try to get me wrong
Just for kickin' another lyric
Over 28 metal songs 
You see I got the best damn job
In whole damn world
Props go out to Jackson Dee
Mad props go out to my girl 

You might want to step the f*ck back
Or just try to fake the funk
And make me attack
You vocally snikt snikt
I'm like wolverine
Cut you deeperthan a fuckin guillotine
It's just like a bad dream
Time to get with the program 
No glam, no glitz
Check this shit f*ck the counterfeits
They want hits
That shits me so please quit
Do I have to make you submit
No you don't want that shit

28 and the system 
Beats so heavy you know you can't lift 'em

Everybody's feelin' laid back another 
Track from the system of the 
Pound and the crew with mad sounds
How long have you waited for us to kick it
Like this the big beats is mad fun
And that's what it is and here we go, go
We got a system where the kids say go
And then we rock em, not with rocks 
But with blocks of guitars and mad cuts
Jedi master jay watch the kid
Rip it up cross faderdarth vader
Watch him bring it on cold rock
The decks in effect and I'm like 
Qui-gon-jinn rock the mic
Get psyched, deadly like a saber 
Feel the force from the source
Cause his no imitator

28 and the system 
Beats so heavy you know you can't lift 'em
