I be the man droppin' the slang on your premises
We the menaces, clanging rappers like they're Genesis
Now what the hell is this I heard, you wanna see this?
Ya best believe this kid, I got more rhymes than Run got Adidas
You can't defeat us so just back up off the metaphor
The Boogie Banger, tell me what the hell's the art for?

Yiggity yeah
The sooky-sooky, bringin' it from the sewer, it's the Boogie Bang
Used to kick the rookie slang, critics wonder "could he hang?"
Drop my first joint and made the whole world flip
Next trip, critics that wasn't wit' it popped lip (like what?)
"Nigga eat dat and nigga eat dis"
But f*ck, nigga need that, get off my nigga, eject

Miggity mog it's the Prince of Darkness here to spark this
Riggity mic, my target's the underground market
I be the rapper and chief, the editor etcetera
The miggity mad dred night predator
'Cause all the time, niggas be frontin' in their rhymes
Claimin' to represent the bastards, missin' classes, doin' time
But when I come through they be like "ooh look, the man!"
Shakin' niggas down like the earth shook Japan

Well all I need is my 40, some Buda and my Timbs
My biggity black benz with them ninteen-inch rims
I gotta maintain and at the same time I watch my ass
The cash, 'cause any fuckin' day could be your last
I took a breather, now we snipin' off the roof
We back up in the booth and gettin' busy off the 100-proof
Of Vodka, I rock a rhyme just for the thrill of it
'Cause when I'm spillin' it I'm fillin' it, check how I'm killin' it

Got ta hold it down
Hold it down, nigga keep it on lock
Hold it down, nigga yeah, nigga keep it on lock

Got ta hold it down
Hold it down, nigga keep it on lock
Hold it down, nigga yeah, nigga keep it on lock

Got ta hold it down
Hold it down, nigga keep it on lock
Hold it down, nigga yeah, nigga keep it on lock

But a'time I write a rhyme I takes some time to make it rougher
So suffer, y'know it's me the nicotine puffer
I miggity made this for the snitches, 'cause for the riches
We never changing faces like them two singin' bitches
So hold it down for '95 or you's a goner
Big up to all my peoples on corner puffin' marijuana

I briggity break the dame, we roll the game
In '92 wit' my crew, ain't a thing changed
But the styles, the miles on the Jeep, the Beamer
The drawers on my ass, the 'erb grass got greener
My knocker plus be droppin' the skills off the top a
The dome for my peoples in the sewer, yo I got ta

Got ta hold it down
Hold it down, nigga keep it on lock
Hold it down, nigga yeah, nigga keep it on lock

Got ta hold it down

The young and the restless, word we don't stop
Hold it down, keep it on lock

Hold it down, keep it on lock
My nigga DJ Scratch wit the real hip-hop
Hold it down, keep it on lock
