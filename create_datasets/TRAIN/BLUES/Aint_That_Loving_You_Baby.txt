Know I love ya, babe?
Know I love ya, babe?
Know I love ya, babe?
But you don't even know my name

Let me tell ya, baby
I'll tell ya what I would do
I would rob, steal, kill somebody
Just ta get back home ta you

Ain't that lovin' ya, baby?
Ain't that lovin' ya, babe?
Ain't that lovin' ya, babe?
But you don't even know my name

Let me tell ya, baby
Don't sound like it's true
They could drop me in the ocean
I'd swim to the bank
An' crawl home ta you

Ain't that lovin' ya, baby?
Ain't that lovin' ya, babe?
Ain't that lovin' ya, baby?
But you don't even know my name

They may kill me, baby, bury me like they do
My body might lie but my spirit gonna rise
And come home to you

Ain't that lovin' ya, baby?
Ain't that lovin' ya, babe?
Ain't that lovin' ya, baby?
But you don't even know my name
