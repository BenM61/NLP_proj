In January it's so nice, 
While slippin' on the slidin' ice
To sip hot chicken soup with rice
Sippin' once, sippin' twice
Sippin' chicken soup with rice

In February it will be
My snowman's anniversary
With cake for him and soup for me!
Happy once, happy twice
Happy chicken soup with rice

In March the wind blows down the door
And spills my soup upon the floor
It laps it up and roars for more
Blowin' once, blowin' twice
Blowin' chicken soup with rice

In April I will go away
To far off Spain or old Bombay
And dream about hot soup all day
Oh my once, oh my twice 
Oh my chicken soup with rice

In May I truly think it best
To be a robin lightly dressed
Concocting soup in side my nest
Mix it once, mix it twice
Mix that chicken soup with rice

In June I saw a charming group 
Of roses all begin to droop
I pepped them up with chicken soup
Sprinkle once, sprinkle twice
Sprinkle chicken soup with rice

In July I'll take a peep
Into the cool and fishy deep
Where chicken soup is selling cheap
Sellin' once, sellin' twice
Sellin' chicken soup with rice

In August it will be so hot
I will become a cooking pot
Cooking soup, of course why not?
Cookin' once, cookin' twice
Cookin' chicken soup with rice

In September for a while
I will ride a crocodile
Down the chicken soupy Nile
Paddle once, paddle twice
Paddle chicken soup with rice

In October I'll be host
To witches, goblins and a ghost
I'll serve them chicken soup on toast
Whoopy once, whoopy twice
Whoopy chicken soup with rice

In November's gusty gale
I will flop my flippy tail
And spout hot soup, I'll be a whale
Spoutin' once, spoutin' twice
Spoutin' chicken soup with rice

In December I will be
A baubled, bangled Christmas tree
With soup bowls draped all over me
Merry once, merry twice
Merry chicken soup with
Merry chicken soup with
Merry chicken soup with rice.

I told you once, I told you twice
All seasons of the year are nice
For eating chicken soup, 
Eating chicken soup with rice
Chicken soup, chicken soup with rice.
