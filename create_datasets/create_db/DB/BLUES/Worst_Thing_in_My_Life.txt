Yes, it was the worst thing in my life, the worst thing I ever witnessed to
Yes, it was the worst thing in my life, the worst thing I ever witnessed to
When the woman that I loved, when she said we were really through

Take it easy baby, lots of things come before we part
Take it easy baby, lots of things come before we part
Yes, lots of those little things you're doing
I want to know if you're doing them, because you think you're so smart

I don't say that you won't leave me, but think of the shape you'll be in
I don't say that you won't leave me, but think of the shape you'll be in
I want to know you'll hate that you ever met me, and you'll hate the day that we began

Why should you 'cuse me, baby, without me giving you a cause
Why should you 'cuse me, baby, without me giving you a cause
I know I've been good to you, baby, as if I was a Santa Claus

You don't think much of your life, to put yourself in a spot
You don't think much of your life, to put yourself in a spot
When the people see me clowning, they all wonder what you got
