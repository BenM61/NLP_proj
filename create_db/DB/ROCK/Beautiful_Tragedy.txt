Silent night
Let me sleep away these memories within
Sacrifices of purities are turning into sins
And this judgment day is drawing near
And this confession is killing me again

This beautiful tragedy
Is crashing into me
This dying destiny

So now you lay yourself down in this grave with shattered eyes
Beautiful melodies to try and wash away the lies
And this judgment day is drawing near
And this confession is killing me again

This beautiful tragedy
Is crashing into me
This dying destiny
Take me away
This beautiful tragedy
Come crashing into me
This dying destiny

Will you be there
Will you be there by my grave
Or will you be
The death of me.
In my, my beautiful tragedy

This beautiful tragedy
Is crashing into me
This dying destiny
Take me away
This beautiful tragedy
Come crashing into me
This dying destiny
