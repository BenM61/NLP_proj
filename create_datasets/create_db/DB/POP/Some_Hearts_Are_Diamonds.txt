Open your heart to all of those years
Baby
you look through a rainbow of tears.
You watched your dreams all fadin' away

This time you're right
oh
you make my day.
Years may come
years may go
But I still love you and I want you to know:

Some hearts are diamonds
some hearts are stone

Some days you're tired of being alone.
Some hearts are diamonds
some hearts are stone

It takes two lovers to be as one.
Illusions of love
they'll come and they'll go

Trust in your heart
maybe your love will grow.
Your silent tears they're so full of pride

Baby
I know that you can't run and hide.
You need love like I do

I hope you want me like I know I want you.
Some hearts are diamonds
Some hearts are stone...

Some hearts are diamonds
some hearts are stone -
Some hearts arr diamonds
some hearts are stone

Some days you're tired of being alone
Some hearts are diamonds.
