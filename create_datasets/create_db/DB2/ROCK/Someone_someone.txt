Someone someone
Someone who really loves yoy
when someone realy loves yoy
that's when your live begins

Once I was loved by no one
no one depended on me
I thought I was truly happy
but oh how wrong can you be


A heart can be easely broken
a heart can even stand still
a heart can be easely broken
but I know that mine never will

Once all the stars were shining
now it's so easy to see
once all the stars were shining
but now they are shining for me
