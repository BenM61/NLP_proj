Good to be alive
Oh It's good to be alive this sunny morning and to see the world so fine.
Yes it's good to stretch your arms and greet the morning and to know that you are mine.
Oh it's good to be alive and to know I'm living what a turn about for me and to think
I used to think that I was living is this happening to me.

Into my days and into my heart and into my life you came and brought me beautiful days
Your beautiful ways now touch my heart let the loving starts.
Oh it's good to be alive this sunny morning and to see the world so fine

You are mine.
Oh it's good to be alive and to know I'm living what a turn about for me ant to think
That I used to think I was living is this happening to me.

Into my days into my heart and into my life you came and brought me beautiful days
Your beautiful ways and touch my heart let the loving starts.
