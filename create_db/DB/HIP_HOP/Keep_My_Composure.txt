Must keep my composure
Must keep my composure 
Space rockin' and killers

Moving through the city
Fill my body with the poison
Head spinning to the rhythm like clockwork
I ain't trying to do no wrong but they leave with no choice man
There is so much spirit cut the curse to my verse
Be the piper pick peppers and I snort lines sorry mom I'm just a man of my times
Even though they hold me hostage
Said I ain't worth a dime and time is money so I ain't worth your time

And I ain't worth your time
But I ain't worth your time
But I ain't worth your time
Hold it down

Must keep my composure
Must keep my composure
Must keep my composure

Run and hold me closer
Until this is over

Must keep my composure
Through your control look

Run hold me closer
Until this is over

Space rockin' and killers

Everybody is quick to put their arms around me
They got nothin' to lose
All this gane shit I'm empty inside
And every time I try to refuel
Quickly ringing
Told me times are hard for zemers
Thought I would be fine but
What?
These bitch ?
But I'm sick of the intent of it
You don't know me and you don't know my style
?
And your thoughts are quarter live

Said you don't know my style
You aint' half this wild
You aint' half this wild

Hold It Down

That's right lets stay groove
Come on and let me see you move
That's right lets stay groove
Come on and let me see you whoa

Hands up
Hands up
Stand up
Stand up (woo)
Uh
Hands up
Hands up
Stand up
Stand up (whoa)
Uh
Hands up
Hands up
Stand up
Stand up (whoa)
Uh
Hands up
Hands up
Stand up
Stand up (whoa)

Takin' it back to the basics face it
We are the kind to pitch this song in basement
And I ain't tying to have a problem here so putcha
Go on and shake it
Get that ass in gear
Go on and shake it
Get that ass in gear
Go on and shake it
Get that ass in gear
Go on and shake it
Get that ass in gear
Go on and shake it
Get that ass in gear
