T-shirts and tight blue jeans, t-shirts
T-shirts and tight blue jeans, t-shirts
T-shirts and tight blue jeans, t-shirts, I like it
T-shirts and tight blue jeans, t-shirts.

You animal, you animal, walking down the street
You animal, you animal, move to the savage beat
Hey Chico, hey Machacha, say there Mr. Macho
Exercise, lift them weights, you work out I'll palipatate
To coin a phrase you're the cat's meow
And I'm the dog so Bow-wow-wow.

T-shirts and tight blue jeans, t-shirts
T-shirts and tight blue jeans, t-shirts
T-shirts and tight blue jeans, t-shirts, I like it
T-shirts and tight blue jeans, t-shirts.

Construction boots, hard hats
Patches on the seems
Wam bam thank you Sam
T-shirts, tight blue jeans.

T-shirts and tight blue jeans, t-shirts

Forget about evening wear
Don't worry when the people stare
Forget about these three piece suits
Let's put on our cowboy boots
Forget about what's on the scene
It's t-shirts and tight blue jeans.

T-shirts and tight blue jeans, t-shirts
T-shirts and tight blue jeans, t-shirts
T-shirts and tight blue jeans, t-shirts, I like it
T-shirts and tight blue jeans, t-shirts.

Your tight blue shirt drives me insane
It makes me want to play those games
Turn the light way up high
Yeah big man don't be shy.
