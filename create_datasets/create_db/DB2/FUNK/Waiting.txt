I don't mind what people say,
They always think the worst anyway
And if I'm wrong I'll pay the price
It's a cost that I don't count as sacrifice
I'm gonna love you anyway
I don't care what people say
I'm gonna love you come what may
I don't care what people say

An opinion held is such demand
But I'd much sooner hold your hand
It's a question of priority
And I think that you would still be here for me 

I'd be a fool to bow to their advice
As if their wish were my command
And I would be a fool to say goodbye
To the love that lies waiting, now
