All of my visions were untrue
Till I had a vision of you
And untimely end for all
But it was only then, only then that I saw
Saw the morning glory.

Can't you take me there
Can't you take me there
Away from soliloquies of sadness
And prophecies of pain
For us all to see.

I had a vision in my mind
I had a vision of peace
I had a vision of you.
