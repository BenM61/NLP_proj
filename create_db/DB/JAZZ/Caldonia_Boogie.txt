Find a wheel and it goes round, round, round
As it skims along with a happy sound
As it goes along the ground, ground, ground
Till it leads you to the one you love

Then your love will hold you round, round, round
In your heart's a song with a brand new sound
And your head goes spinning round, round, round
'cause you've found what you've been dreamin' of

In the night you see the oval moon
Going round and round in tune 
And the ball of sun in the day
Makes a girl and boy want to say

Find a ring and put it round, round, round
And with ties so strong that two hearts are bound
Put it on the one you've found, found, found
For you know that this is really love
