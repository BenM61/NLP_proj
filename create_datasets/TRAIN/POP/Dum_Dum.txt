Da-rup, da-rup, da-rup, da 
Dum dum, a-diddly dum oh 
Ho-ho
Dum dum, a-diddly dum 
Oh yeah !
Dum dum, a-diddly dum;

The music's sweet, the lights are low,
The playing is soft on the radio,
Your ma's in the kitchen, your pa's next door,
I wanna love you just a little bit more

Singin' dum dum, a-diddly dum, Ah, hah
Dum dum, a-diddly dum;
Sing it out, dum dum, a-diddly dum

Come on, baby, don't you be so shy,
You know that I love you, let me tell you why,
You've got a heart, I know that it's true,
I couldn't love you any more than I do;

Singin' dum dum, a-diddly dum, Oh yeah
Dum dum, a-diddly dum, 
One more time
Dum dum, a-diddly dum

Ah ! I want you with me all of the time,
Tell me you love me and you'll be mine,
There's so many things that we could do,
So say the words and make my dreams come true

Singin' dum dum, a-diddly dum, Ah, hah
Dum dum, a-diddly dum, 
Sing it out 
Dum dum, a-diddly dum

Dum dum, diddly dum, sing it out 
Dum dum, diddly dum, 
I can't hear you 
Dum dum, diddly dum, Oh, yeah
Dum dum
