Men like me 'cause I speak my mind 
And women like me 'cause I take my time 
Try not to take life too serious 
I might get burned 
If you've got somethin' to show me 
I'm willing to learn 
Got enough trouble just making it day to day 
And when the world starts spinnin' 
'N I feel like I'm going insane 

I got a system that's guaranteed 
I got a rock 'n roll strategy 
It ain't no science but it works for me 
It's just a rock 'n roll strategy 

Get in my car 
Head downtown 
Turn up the radio roll the windows down 
It ain't no science but it gets me around 
It's just rock 'n roll strategy 

Turn it up 
If you walk down the middle people criticize you for 
Sitting on a fence 
And if you walk on the right 

Or you walk on the left 
They say you're much too radical to make any sense 
Can't win for losin' 
Might as well be yourself 
And when it gets so confusin' 
You fell like checkin' out 

I got a system that's guaranteed 
I got a rock 'n roll strategy 
It ain't no science but it works for me 
It's just a rock 'n roll strategy 

Can't win for losin' 
Might as well be yourself 
And when it gets so confusin' 
You feel like checkin' out 
I got a system that's guaranteed 
I got a rock 'n roll strategy 
It ain't no science but it works for me 
It's just a rock 'n roll strategy 

Get in my car 
Head downtown 
Turn up the radio roll the windows down 
It ain't no science but it gets me around 

It's just rock 'n roll strategy 
I got a system that's bonafide 
Works for me every time I try 
It ain't no science but it gets me by 
It's just a rock 'n roll strategy 
Turn it up
