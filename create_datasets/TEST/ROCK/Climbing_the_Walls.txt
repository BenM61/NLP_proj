Climbing the walls
I'm safe until the moment I close my eyes
Climbing the Walls
I don't know if I can make it through the night
I'm going to find my way
Someday, maybe, I'm going to come down
I'll start all over again
I can't afford this high that's all around me
We all want to live forever
And I'm starting it all today
I am climbing the walls
I am climbing the walls
Now here I am with a stranger and
I'm faced again with a needle
How am I supposed to relate to you?
Help stop me now if you would
Because I could fly from here and make if feel good
And I could rule the world, but I'm misunderstood
I'll start all over again
I can't afford this high, but it's all around me
We all want to live forever
We all want to be something someday
Ready to taste whatever is yet to come
And I'm starting it all today
Today, today
I am climbing the walls
I am climbing the walls
Climbing the walls
I don't know if I can make it through the night
We all want to live forever
We all want to be something someday
Ready to taste whatever is yet to come
And I'm starting it all today
It all today, today, today
I am climbing the walls
Climbing the walls
Climbing the walls
I am climbing the walls
