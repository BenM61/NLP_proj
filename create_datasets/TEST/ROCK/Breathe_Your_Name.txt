It's everyday I'm in this place
I feel this way, I feel the same.
It's everyday I'm in this place
I feel this way, I feel the same.
Is it all inside my head?
Is it all inside my head?

I view the list and take my pick,
I'll view my fate and make the choice,
'Cause it's nobody else's but mine.

But You're in my heart, I can feel your beat.
And You move my mind from behind the wheel
When I loose control,
I can only breathe Your name.
I can only breathe Your name.

So many days within this race,
I need the truth, I need some grace.
I need the ? to find my place,
I need some truth, I need some grace.
The part of You that's part of me
Will never die, will never leave.
And it's nobody else's but mine.

You are in my heart, I can feel your beat.
And You move my mind from behind the wheel.
When I loose control,
I can only breathe your name,
I can only breathe your name.

You view the list and take your pick,
You view my fate and make the choice,
'Cause I'm nobody else's but Yours.

And You're in my heart--I can feel your beat,
And You move my mind from behind the wheel.
When I loose control,
I can only breathe Your name.
'Cause you're in my heart--I can feel Your beat,
And you move my mind from behind the wheel.
When I loose control,
I can only breathe your name
I can only breathe your name
I can only breathe your name
I can only breathe your name
