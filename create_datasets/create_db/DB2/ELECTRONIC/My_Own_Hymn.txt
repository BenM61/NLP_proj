In the confines of a photograph
Lives a child who once was me
Ooh, do you see? I still see through those eyes
Why did you choose to believe bare-faced lies
And let the troubles of others darken your skies?

I wrote my own hymn
I sing my own hymn
It says, ooh "your soul is good!"
I wrote my own hymn
I sing my own hymn
It says "yes, your soul is good!"

In the remnants of our time I wake 
To find you've broken me
Used to be free
But in pain I chose to stay
Why did you choose to believe things unkind?
Oh, hallelujah!
Heaven is in your mind

I wrote my own hymn
I sing my own hymn
It says, ooh "your soul is good!"
I wrote my own hymn
I sing my own hymn
It says "Yes, your soul is good!"

I wrote my own hymn
I sing my own hymn
It says, " yes,your soul is good!"
