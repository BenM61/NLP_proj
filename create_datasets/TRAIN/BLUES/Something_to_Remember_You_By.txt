Oh, give me something to remember you by
When you are far away from me
Just a little something, meaning love cannot die
No matter where you chance to be

So I'll pray for you, night and day for you
It will see me through like a charm 'til you return
So give me something I can remember you by
When you are far away from me

So I'll pray for you, every single day for you
It will see me through like a charm until you return
Give me something, something to remember you by
When you are far away from me
