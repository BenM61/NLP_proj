Laying out on some early acts
Losing your way
Getting way off track
Ain't no stopping
Time from coming

When tomorrow hits
When tomorrow hits
When tomorrow hits

What's easy for you
Comes so hard
What you got
Never got me far
There's no stopping
The end from coming

When tomorrow hits
When tomorrow hits
When tomorrow hits

All right
Lookout
When tomorrow hits
It'll hit you hard
When tomorrow hits
It'll hit you hard
When tomorrow hits
It'll hit you hard
When tomorrow hits

That's the lowdown
