Bad luck streak in dancing school 
Down on my knees in pain 
Bad luck streak in dancing school 
Swear to God I'll change
Swear to God I'll change
Swear to God I'll change
Swear to God I'll change

Pauline, don't make me beg
Bad luck streak in dancing school 
Down on my knees in pain 
I've been acting like a fool 
Pauline I swear I'll change 
Down on my knees in pain
Down on my knees in pain
Down on my knees in pain
Down on my knees in pain

Bad luck streak in dancing school 
Down on my knees in pain 
I've been breaking all the rules
Swear to God I'll change
Swear to God I'll change
Swear to God I'll change
Swear to God I'll change
Swear to God I'll change

Down on my knees in pain
Down on my knees in pain
Down on my knees in pain
Down on my knees in pain
