There she goes Miss Heartattack
That girl is gone, ain't comin' back
Love we had call it yesterday
But now is now, today's today

And when the sun is shinin'
I still feel the same
And when the rain is comin' down
I'm hurtin' with the pain
I've been here before

No love, no way, no more
Am I just a fool to fall for love
Put my heart in gunnysack
Dress it up in black on black
Take it down to Congo Square
Raise it from the dead down there

And when the sun is shinin'
I will feel no pain
And when that rain is pourin' down
I'm on my feet again
