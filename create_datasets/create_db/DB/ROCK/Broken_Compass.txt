I've become distorted lines
From above I blur in time
Let me fade away
I could drown right here tonight
Breathe it in I'll be alright
Getting closer now
Like a wave I washed away
Left behind what I didn't say
Turn your back again
Just turn your back again

This is impossible
Feels like were lost without a hand
It's so hard for us to navigate
This is impossible
I fear we come and go alone
So hard just to communicate
It's over

Watch me eat myself alive
Stood right here a thousand times
Couldn't help me if you tried
If I'm diving into you
I'll be the desperate
I'll be abused
Just don't count me out

They're not gonna change me
They're not gonna save me
I'll just save myself
I'll just save my fucking self
Don't save me
I'll save my fucking self
