(Do you think about me)
(Do you think about me)
(Do you think about me)

You think about money when you think about me huh,
That's what my ex, my ex you don't want to be her,
She used to have the beemer, now she own a sneaker,
I had her eating lobster now she eating pizza,
I think about Easter when I think about Keyshia,
Shorty stay fly that's why I keep her,
Round like the reefer, brown Mona Lisa,
She good if I leave her she got her own visa,
Think about them when you about frontin'
Think about stuntin' when you think about me,
I'm the boss Bentley or the Porsche,
Overseas, see jet skis slide across,
I love the way you dress,
Now take it off,
Put your legs high on my shoulders of course,
I'm racing through your mind but you already lost,
I'm at the finish line and your the friend of mine,
Come on lets ride

Just a lil' bit
Every now and then
God damn girl, we used to be friends
Just a lil' bit
Just a lil' bit
Just a lil' bit
Just a lil' bit

I think like a hustler,
I'm thinking bout a shipment,
She thinking I'm her husband,
So she thinking bout commitment,
Its like Paul McCartney stuck in my head,
Fell in love with a bitch walked away with one leg,
She ain't even have to run to get away with the bread,
That's some fucked up shit
Think about that kid,
I'm thinking what this bitch thinking when she take me to court,
I pay my child support, what the f*ck she want,
This relationship, shit its too much for me,
I wanna f*ck your friends and live comfortably
She wanna shine and blow minds on shopping sprees,
She should have what she wants just not for me,
I'm thinking bout my future she part of my past,
She don't care bout me she just want some cash,
I'm thinking damn girl, we used to be friends,
How did sh-t become all about ends

Just a lil' bit
Every now and then
God damn girl, we used to be friends
Just a lil' bit
Just a lil' bit
Just a lil' bit
Just a lil' bit

Do you think about me?
(Do you think about me?)
I know you think about me,
(You gotta remember all the good times we had)
Just a lil' bit
Just a lil' bit
Just a lil' bit

Do you think about me?
(Remember when you told me,
That I would always be special to you darling)
I know you think about me,
You were so special to me
Do you think about me?
