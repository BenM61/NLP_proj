Like a bird flies from tree to treetop
On the wings of a special love
I hear the sound of young hearts beating

Love is never where you think you'll find it
All you need is the very first kiss

Then you're...
Walking on air
Love won't let you come down
Walking on air

Your feet will never touch
Walking on air
Love has finally caught you

Love's a ride that can last a lifetime
You find your heart in a warm embrace
Then you can go around the world
In just 5 minutes

There's so many ways to say you love her
It's so easy once you make the first move

Then you're...
Walking on air
Love has really hit you
Walking on air

Your feet will never touch
Walking on air
And love won't let you come down

Lovelovelove
How can you wonder
If you really love her?
It's so easy once you make the first move

Walking on air
Love has finally hit you
Walking on air

Your feet'll never touch
Walking on air
And love won't let you
Love won't let you
Love love won't let you...

Come down
I'm walkin on air

Lovelovelove
