Baby don't you look so sad you know we have
Something that should only ever make you smile
It's not like it was something we were looking for we were sliding doors
It's what it is it doesn't need to be defined

No regrets, come to bed
I'll set all your worries free
Come with me, it's what you need
Shut your mouth just let it be
Just let it go and let it be

Ooh, everything is meant to be a memory
Ooh, so one last time do anything you want with me
And I promise I will leave you
With a beautiful goodbye

I won't lie but I'll apologize
Cuz I'll never make a promise you know I won't keep
I'll make love to you, I know you want it, too
Whisper something sweet but no more questions please

Drops of sweat, dripping wet
The taste of you all over me
You will see, It's what you need
Shut your mouth just let it be
Just let it be

Ooh, everything is meant to be a memory
Ooh, so one last time do anything you want with me
And I promise I will leave you
With a beautiful goodbye

Nothing good lasts forever, Nothing
Ooh Nothing lasts forever Nothing
Nothing can last forever, Nothing
Nothing lasts forever, Nothing

Ooh, everything is meant to be a memory
Ooh, so one last time do anything you want with me
And I promise I will leave you
With a beautiful goodbye
