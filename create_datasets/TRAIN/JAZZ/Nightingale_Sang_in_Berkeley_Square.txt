That certain night, the night we met 
There was magic abroad in the air 
There were angels dining at the Ritz 
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square 
I maybe right, I maybe wrong 

But I'm perfectly willing to swear 
That when you turned and smiled at me 
A nightingale sang in Berkeley Square 
The moon that lingered over London town 
Poor puzzled moon, he wore a frown 

How could he know we two were so in love 
The whole darn world seemed upside down 
The streets uptown were paved with stars 
It was such a romantic affair 
And as we kissed and said goodnight 
A nightingale sang in Berkeley Square!
