This remarkable sometimes incoherent transcript, 
Illustrates a phantasmagoria of fear, terror, grief, exultation and finally breakdown. 
The highlights have been compressed on this recording to make their own disquieting points.

The time is 9:30 P.M. 
One hour after the participants have eaten sugar cubes saturated with LSD. 
We hear Brian and his fellow travelers observing their gradual transformation.

Brian has been amusing his friends by chewing on some plastic flashbulbs.

The time is now 1:00 A.M. 
Brian is unable to snap his fingers, and terminate the trip which continues.

He sobs, as his joy turns to fear.

Brian's rocky journey ended twelve hours after it so innocently has begin. 
He was shattered by it.

This young man never had a bummer, 
In some thirty-three LSD trips. 
Everyone of them was a delight, 
He only needed to snap his fingers and down he came, anytime. 
But on Voyage 34 he finally met himself coming down an up staircase and the encounter was crushing.
