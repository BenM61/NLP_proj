I was lost in the lakes
And the shapes that your body makes
That your body makes
That your body makes, that your body makes

And the mountains said I will find you here
They whispered the snow and the leaves in my ear
I traced my finger along your trails
And your body was the map, I was lost in it

Falling over your rocky spine
The glaciers made you and now you're mine
Falling over your rocky spine
The glaciers made you and now you're mine

I was moving across your frozen veneer
The sky was dark but you were clear
Could you feel my footsteps?
And would you shatter, would you shatter? Would you?

With your soft fingers between my claws
Like purity against resolve
I could tell then there we were formed from the clay
And came from the rocks for the earth to display

They told me to be careful up there
Where the wind rose up there, in this rage through your hair
They told me to be careful up there
Where the wind rages through your hair
