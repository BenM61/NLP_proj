Let me tell ya, 
You're at the jubilee, or you're all alone 
Because the more, the merrier it sound 
Friends all tell me so 
The birds wake up the grass, and tell everybody, say it's time to grow 
The sun whispers to the birds, oh the song yet to be sung... 

Song yet to be sung, (song yet to be sung) the song yet to be sung... 

Give them the world ay yi yi 

You're at the jubilee,or you're all alone 
Because the more, the merrier it sound 
My friends, everybody, they all tell me so 
From the heights, from the heights of saiyon 
Ohhh yeah, whisper in your ear 
We got to play on, what a designery 
A little bit of song, the song yet to be sung 

Song yet to be sung (song yet to be sung) song yet to be sung 
Song yet to be sung (song yet to be sung) song yet to be sung
