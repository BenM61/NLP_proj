My brightest star's my inner light
Let it guide me
Experience and innocence bleed inside me
Hallucinogens can open me or untie me
I drift in inner space free of time
I find a higher state of grace in my mind

I'm beautiful 
I wasn't born to follow
I live just for today
I don't care about tomorrow
What I got in my head 
You can't buy, steal or borrow
I believe in life and let live
I believe you get what you give

I've glimpsed I have tasted 
Fantastical places
My soul's an oasis
Higher than the sun
I'm higher than the sun

I'm higher than the sun
Higher than the sun
Higher than the sun 
Higher than the sun
Higher than the sun
Higher than the sun
Higher than the sun
Higher than the sun 
Higher than the sun
Higher than the sun
