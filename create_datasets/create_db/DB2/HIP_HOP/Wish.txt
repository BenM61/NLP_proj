Is there a world beyond these white walls?
Is there a life out there for me?
Will there ever be another sunrise
Other than the one inside my dreams?

Can you hold on to me tightly?
Will you ever let me go?
There are just so many things
That I need to know
Can you hold on to me tightly?
Will you ever let me fall?
Sometimes I just wish that I was
Not like me at all

I haven't seen something different
Beyond this cage I call reality
Raindrops on my fingers, snowflakes on my tongue
Seem like something never meant for me

So take these walls and tear them down
Feel the sunlight shining all around
Take this body, make it whole again
Make this the beginning, not the end

Can you hold on to me tightly?
Will you ever let me go?
There are just so many things
That I need to know
Can you hold on to me tightly?
Will you ever let me fall?
Sometimes I just wish that I was
Not like me at all

The world outside my window calls
Far away like some forgotten friend
I'll no longer have to close my eyes
And live a life that's only make-pretend

So take these walls and tear them down
Feel the sunlight shining all around
Take this body, make it whole again
Make this the beginning, not the end
