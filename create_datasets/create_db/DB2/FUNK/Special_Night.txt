Every night is a special night
When I'm with you, girl
When I'm with you
The way you hold me
In your arms, so so tight
The way that you do, girl
The way that you do

And I don't mind
The hustle and the bustle and the ride
'Cause it's so worthy
Because of you

See, I'm just a sad and lonely man
Livin' in a lonely world
And you came and took my hand
Now my prayers have been answered
I'm so glad to be your man
Let me thank you, thank you, thank you
I wanna thank you, love

Every night is a special night
When I'm with you, girl
When I'm with you
The way you hold me
In your arms, so so tight
The way that you do, girl
The way that you do

I don't mind
The hustle and the bustle and the ride
It's so worthy
Because of you

See, I've been all alone
For so long
I thought no one would come along
Then you appeared
Straight out of heaven
Now I wanna thank you
By singing this song
Let me thank you, thank you, thank you
I wanna thank you, love

If you don't know 
What is like to be lonely
Than you can't know
How I feel
I said, it feels so good when somebody love you
It feels so good when somebody care

Every night is a special night
When I'm with you, girl
When I'm with you
The way you hold me
In your arms, so so tight
The way that you do, girl
The way that you do

Every night is a special night
When I'm with you, girl
When I'm with you

Loneliness
Yes, what is loneliness?
Loneliness is the absence 
Of someone or others who care about you
Loneliness
Can numb the senses
In other words
Your smell, taste, touch, sight, hearing are slightly impaired
Loneliness can be dangerous
And should be avoided if possible
And for those of you who are lonely now
I urge you to find someone soon
