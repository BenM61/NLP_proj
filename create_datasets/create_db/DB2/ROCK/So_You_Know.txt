Just so you know, just so you know
Just so you know, just so you know

I got to find a way to grieve without my head sticking into my heart
I don't want to let her leave without my heads thinking this is the start
I was dreaming before that she believes that I'm the one who's on her side
Cannot let this go until I get my way
Stay

Just so you know
Just so you know
I never believed you
Just so you know
Just so you know
I want you to stay

Looking closely at a picture of myself from years ago
Looking closely at a stranger who could never let it show
Now I still feel empty as I lay here and absorb myself
Cannot let this go until I get my way
Stay

Just so you know
Just so you know
I never believed you
Just so you know
Just so you know
I want you to stay

Stay
Stay

Stay
Just so you know
Just so you know
I never believed you
Just so you know
Just so you know
I want you to stay

Stay
Just so you know
Just so you know
I never believed you
Just so you know
Just so you know
I want you to stay

Stay
Just so you know, just so you know
Just so you know, just so you know
