I woke up early
And I can't see the light
My back is broad but
It's been a long and lonely night
What if I'm a fool for even trying
To right the wrongs when all we
Had is dying

Like moving shadows
We dance around remains
The burning embers
Illuminate my shame
So yes, I am a fool for even trying
To right the wrongs when all
We had is dying

It's easier to leave
Not to face the pain
With everything to lose
Nothing left to gain
Broken
Empty promises you made
Token
Empty gestures that you made
I am reeling, reeling
Easier to leave
So you walked away With everything to lose
There's nothing left to say

You disappoint me With a Judus kiss
Crown and anoint me
The poison pours from your lips
So yes, I am a fool for even trying
To right the wrongs when ail we had is dying

It's easier to leave
Not to face the pain
With everything to lose
Nothing left to gain
Broken
Empty promises you made
Token
Empty gestures that you made
I am reeling, reeling
Easier to leave
So you walked away With everything to lose
There's nothing left to say

Broken
Empty Promises you gave
Token
Empty gestures that yov made
Unspoken
Did you ever mean to stay
I am reeling, reeling
I am reeling
I am betrayed
