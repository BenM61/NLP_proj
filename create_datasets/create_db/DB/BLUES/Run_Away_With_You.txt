I would've run away with you
If I hadn't asked what I should do
Believe me what I say is true
I would've run, run away with you

I would've known it from the start
If I had listened to my heart
You'll never know but this is true
I would've run, run away with you
Run away with you

I was afraid at what they might say
When I could have turned the other way
You've got to know this love is true
And that I would've run, run away with you
Run away with you
Run away with you
Run away with you
Run away with you
Run away with you
Run away with you
Run away with you
