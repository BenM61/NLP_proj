(Give it up, to give it up)
You know what's on my mind
(Give it up, to give it up, girl)
You've been wastin' too much time

You know you got what I want
You come on, you're 'bout to blow my mind
(Can you dig it? 
Give it up, to give it up, girl)
You've been wastin' too much time

(Give it up, to give it up, girl)
You know what's on my mind
Ah, don't wait another longer

Patiently I've waited, baby, waited just for you
And I ain't gonna move and act till you do what you're supposed to do
You got your thing together and I can't waited too
And that's the very reason, baby, 
I'm stickin' here with you

(Give it up, to give it up, girl)
You know what I'm talkin' about, give it to me
(You can dig it, to give it up, girl)
Yeah, make me shout

Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me

(Give it up, to give it up, girl)
My baby, don't take so long
It's right around the corner
I'm gonna get it and bring it home

(Give it, give it up, child)
Oh, make me shout
(Give it, to give it up, girl)
Oh, that's what I'm talkin' about

Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me

That's right, baby
Now you just give it to me
