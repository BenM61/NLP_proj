No sweat, no pain
No lost, no gain
More of the same
You've got to stop that straight away

Beg the question
There in the answer lies
Search your soul for a self control
(redefine your roll
But keep your feet on the ground)

Sooner or later
Maybe tomomrrow
Sooner or later
You've got to learn to say no

I'll be cruel to be kind
You play it cool every time
Playing games in your mind
You've got to stop that straight away

Sad and lonely
But you say you're having fun
Don't you know you been had enough
When push comes to shove
You always let yourself down

Sooner or later
Maybe tomorrow
Sooner or later
You've got to learn to say no

The key to moving on is knowing when it's over
Sometimes surrender is the only way to go

Sad and lonely
But you say you're having fun
Seem to me you've been so confused
Can't you see that it's time to choose
You've got to beg your questions
There in the answer lies
Don't you know you been had enough
When push comes to shove you're always let yourself down

Sooner or later
Maybe tomorrow
Sooner or later
You've got to learn to say no
