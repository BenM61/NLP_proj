You love me with your eyes, you melt me with your smile
And I can't resist you
You always look so cute, your clothes, your attitude
And I just wanna kiss you

But don't get so tense when I hang with my friends
'Cos it's not making sense and it's not like you

You want to spend from now until the end
Of time with me
I don't want to fight, I want to make it right
And I want you to be happy

So don't get uptight if I don't call tonight
'Cos I've got a right boy, to live my life
