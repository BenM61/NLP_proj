Listen people, come on listen good
We're gonna dance, gossa do you some good
You've got to pull off your shoes
You've got to pull off your shirt 

refrain:
Relax yourself, getting ready to do the dirt
Doing the dirt (dirt), you've got to watch me work (work) 

You've got to stretch your legs, as far as you can
Stretch your legs now, so your knees wont bend
You've got to bend your hips, bend it good
Shuffle your arms, like I know would
Doing the dirt, doing the dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty now
Get nasty 

You've got to step some to the left,
You've got to step some to the right,
Feels so good now, you can do it all night 

refrain (4x) 

I know you can do it now
You've got to bend your hips, bend it good
Shuffle your arms, like I know would
