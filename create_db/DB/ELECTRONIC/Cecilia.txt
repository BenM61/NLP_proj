Cecilia, you're breaking my heart
You're shaking my confidence daily
Oh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you please to come home

Cecilia, you're breaking my heart
You're shaking my confidence daily
Oh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you please to come home
Come on home

Making love in the afternoon
With Cecilia up in my bedroom (making love)
I got up to wash my face
When I come back to bed someone's taken my place

Cecilia, you're breaking my heart
You're shaking my confidence daily
Oh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you please to come home
Come on home

Hey, you should know you never treat me too right
Should've come home you shouldn't stay out at night
Think you never know you shouldn't treat me this way
And you know I wouldn't stray
Man, you should've known you could have give me everything
Go down on your knee, you should've put on the ring
Oh deny the rest, to me alone you should sing
And you know I wouldn't stray, no way

Jubilation, she loves me again
I fall on the floor and I love it
Oh, jubilation she love me again
I fall on the floor and I love it

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
