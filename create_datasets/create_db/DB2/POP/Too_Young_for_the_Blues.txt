Such a bad thing to run away from my mother 
Right into the arms of a lover
I should walk away from you in my brand new shoes
Because I'm just too young, too young for the blues
I'm a baby, and your kiss is so tender
I'm a big fool if I ever surrender

I'll come back some day when I learn the rules
Because I'm just too young, too young for the blues
Soon enough the blues will come and break my heart 
So I'll make my getaway before the teardrops start
It's a hard game and I'm just a beginner
Why play if the blues is the winner
If I stick around I know I'll lose
Because I'm just too young, too young for the blues

Soon enough the blues will come and break my heart 
So I'll make my getaway before the teardrops start
It's a hard game and I'm just a beginner
Why play if the blues is the winner
If I stick around I know I'll lose
Because I'm just too young, too young for the blues
Just too young, too young for the blues.
