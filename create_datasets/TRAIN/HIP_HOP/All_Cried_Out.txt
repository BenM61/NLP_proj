All alone on a Sunday morning
Outside I see the rain is falling
Inside I'm slowly dying
But the rain will hide my crying

And you, don't you know my tears will burn the pillow
Set this place on fire 'cause I'm tired of your lies
All I needed was a simple "Hello"
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear my cry

Ah, I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you, you leave me so confused
Now I'm all cried out over you

Oh, you. All over you, oooh
Never wanted to see things you way
I had to go astray, oh, why was I such a fool?
Now I see that the grass is greener (why oh why)
Is it too late for me to find my way home,
How could I be so wrong? (Leavin' me all alone)

Don't you know the heart will cause an inferno
Romance up in flames, why should I take the blame
You were the one who left me neglected (I'm so sorry)
Apology not accepted, add me to the broken hearts you collected

Ah, I gave you all of me (gave me all of you)
How was I to know you would weaken so easily
Ah, I don't what to do
I'm all cried out (I'm all) over you (I'm cried out too)

Ah, I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you (I left you so confused, now I'm all cried out)
Now I'm all cried out...over you...
