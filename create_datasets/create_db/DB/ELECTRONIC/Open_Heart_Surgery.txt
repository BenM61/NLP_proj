I'll open up if you make an incision
I'll do right by you
All I ask is for your care and precision
And maybe I could pull through

You could've saved me if you'd only known better
But you so carlessly
Took me apart and put me back together
Open heart surgery

I was fine at first
Now I assume the worst
When I could overhear
The repercussions of a sad discussion
Another girl in tears

I could've saved here if I only knew better
That you so carelessly
Took her apart and put her back together
Open heart surgery

If girls like you and girls like me
Are really a dime a dozen
Why are we in such a high demand
My mother says it's just a shame you don't come around too often
Even she's begun to understand

Just let me know
What you were thinking
I find a way to get along somehow
Just let me go
Don't leave me hanging
Oh, please don't fail me now

Just take it slow
Don't let me suffer
I'm on the verge of an emergency
The final blow
Will make me tougher
Until then you will always be
A danger to me

We should've listened to our intuition
But we knew all to well
In addition to our suspicions
Only time could tell

With friends like you I get confused
Who needs enemies
We've been here too many times before
Open heart surgery

If girls like you and girls like me
Are really a dime a dozens
Why are we in such a high demand
My mother says it's just a shame you don't come around too often
Even she's begun to understand

Just let me know
What you were thinking
I find a way to get along somehow
Just let me go
Don't leave me hanging
Oh, please don't fail me now

Just take it slow
Don't let me suffer
I'm on the verge of an emergency
The final blow
Will make me tougher
Until then you will always be
A danger to me
A danger to me
