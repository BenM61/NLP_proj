We caught up easy, 
I was up and you were down
Your face reads nothing
But It made you sound
So I'm not about
To show you up and weep

I've seen you flicker
Out the corner of my eye
It? made me look up
As you passed us by
So you broke a smile
And turned your back to leave

You're timeless, I'm only wanting more
When you were running by, did I look unsure?
Cause you played me along
And I'll never leave it down.

You didn't have to become
Chasing time
I only ever wanted to make you mine
But I was always too far from your side
I got left behind

It sunk in deeper
When I woke up you were gone
I said I'm easy but
But It's been too long
Cause? you left enough
To leave me wanting more

I know you figured
I'll be better when in time
I let you go
And got get my next in line
Took a second best
And you will never know

Cos you're timeless, I'm only wanting more
When you caught my eye did I look unsure
Cause you played me along
Now how can I leave it down

You didn't have to become
Chasing time
I only ever wanted to make you mine
But I was always too far from your side
I got left behind

You're timeless, I'm only wanting more
When I was on your mind, did I look unsure?
Cause you played me along
Now how can I leave it down

You didn't have to become
Chasing time
I only ever wanted to make you mine
But I was always too far from your side
I got left behind

Cos I was always too far from your side
I got left behind
