Frank bought a heater
An the elements were made of wire and clay
He reached out to touch and he heard a voice say
And he heard it say

"Come on and plug me in
I want to feel that heat begin
Don't move till the morning comes
And you can fly up to the sun
So come on and plug me in
Plug me in
Plug me in"

Frank liked his heater
His electric heater
Upstairs alone with the elements
He dreamed of gold and frankincense
(Frank, frank, frankincense)
And he heard it say

"Come on and plug me in
I want to feel that heat begin
Come close and listen while I sing
I won't melt your precious wings
So come on and plug me in
Plug me in
Plug me in"

"Come on and plug me in
I want to feel that heat begin
Although my body is rusting through
I have carried this song for you...
It's from the Sphinx and the Serpent too
So plug me in"
