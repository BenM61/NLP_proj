Finger on the trigger
Let it bang bang, baby let it bang
I don't give a damn 
Cause I'm a rebel kind
Watch me do my thang

Let me introduce you to my Lucy
I don't care if you like me
(I'll walk it out on 'em)
Running from the law
I'll hit the borderline
They trying to trap me
So let's get down baby

I'll be locking and loading
I'll be shooting forever
Got my eye on the target
And I'm aiming at cha
See me moving in silence
Feel destruction and violence
Got my eye on the target
And I'm aiming at cha

Bang, Bang (I'm aiming at cha)
Bang, Bang (I'm aiming at cha)

Ain't nothing like the feeling of that cold cold metal in my hand
Know I sound psycho, Daddy-o, you'll never understand
Let me introduce you my chrome-plated bullet
She shining
(I'll whip it out on 'em)
Polishing my '45 Chevy ride scraping the highway
Top down, pick it up

I'll be locking and loading
I'll be shooting forever
Got my eye on the target
And I'm aiming at cha
See me moving in silence
Feel destruction and violence
Got my eye on the target
And I'm aiming at cha

Bang, Bang (I'm aiming at cha)
Bang, Bang (I'm aiming at cha)

(I'm aiming at cha)
(I'm aiming at cha)

Baby I should leave and let it die
Take it like a soldier and dont cry
Hold my hand, come down from my eye
 
I'll be locking and loading
I'll be shooting forever
Got my eye on the target
And I'm aiming at you
See me moving in silence
Feel destruction and violence
Got my eye on the target
And I'm aiming at cha

Bang, Bang

See me moving in silence
Feel destruction and violence
Got my eye on the target
And I'm aiming at cha

Bang, Bang (I'm aiming at cha)
Bang, Bang (I'm aiming at cha)

(I'm aiming at cha)
(I'm aiming at cha)

Let me introduce you to my Lucy, ow, hey oh
Bang bang bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang
Bang, ow
