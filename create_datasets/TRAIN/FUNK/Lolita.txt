Stop it baby

You're a VIP
At least to me
Come here and show
Me some ID
I know you're fine
From head to pumps
If you were mine
We'd bump, bump, bump

You're much to young
To peep my stash
You're tryin' to write
Checks you're body can't cash

You can't hang with this, girl

Lolita, you're sweeter
But you'll never make a cheater out of me

Watch out now

Cool together, yes
I must admit
Long time ago
We'd be the shh uh oh
Like Frank and Ava
We'd paint the town
Just on the floor
Gettin' way down

Dom Perignon and caviar
The finest clothes, and fancy cars
Oh you know, one of them '56 pink caddies, baby! 
Oh!

Look out
Lolita, you're sweeter
But you'll never make a cheater out of me
No you won't!
Hey hey hey

Lolita

You're Is, you're mouth
You're curly hair, you're bad no doubt
But I must beware

Oh, You get a brother in trouble girl

Lolita, you're sweeter
But I won't mislead ya
I'll feed ya
If it please ya
But then I'll say see ya
You're a fine, mama mia
But you'll never ever, never ever
No you'll never make a cheater out of me

Fellas!
Yeah!
How bad is this girl?
Bad!
Then what you wanna do?
Whatever you want!
Then come on let's dance!
Dance?

Lolita?
Yeah?
How bad are you girl?
Bad!
Then What you wanna do?
Whatever you want!
Then come on let's dance!
Dance?

Imagine me on the tip of you're tongue
If I took a sip then I would be on the run
Hellhounds barkin' round my door
I can't sip you once
'Less I sip you some more
Lolita!

Better get out of here
'Less you wanna dance
