Preachers and their followers
Crusading for the light
My stomach twists and tightens up
The feeling is so vile
They're trying to brainwash me
But I am not a fool
Each one shall taste my defecation
As dark becomes the rule

Kill screams my mind

They die by knife and strangulation
Lead pipe to the head
They squeal like pigs
Until I shit upon their severed head
They squeal like pigs
Until I shit upon their severed head

To eternally serve the dark and impure
I breathe each hateful breath
To see their minds and morals destroyed
I shall follow death

Snuff out the life
Of those who force their ways upon me
On their limp carcasses
I leave a token of my disgust
