So many times before
I had to let you know
The very thought of you
Is too hard to bear
Faults like mine
Not this time
So go ahead all lonely
Just like you know you want to

So many times before
I had to let you know
The very thought of you
Is too hard to bear
Faults like mine
Not this time
So go ahead all lonely
Just like you know you want to

Faults like mine (Not this time)
So go ahead all lonely (Not this time)
So go ahead all lonely (Not this time)
So go ahead all lonely (Not this time)
Just like you know you want to (So go ahead all lonely)
Just like you know you want to
