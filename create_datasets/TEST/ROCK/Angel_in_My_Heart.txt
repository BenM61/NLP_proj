Play upon your heart strings to me
I will sing a strange melody
Dance with me a magic ballet
Stay with me 'til night turns to day
Let me in your dreams

Angel in my heart
Angel in my heart

By a pool of darkening dreams
Love is slowly twisting downstream
Underneath the tortue trees
Out into the sad, silent seas
Lock me in your arms

Angel in my heart
Angel in my heart

How can I feel, how can I feel love when you're gone
How much sin, how much can true forgiving cost
I'm in your skin, I want to win back what I've lost

How can I feel, how can I feel love when you're gone
I'm in your skin, I want to win back what I've lost

I can feel the salt on my skin
I can hear the birds on the wing
I can smell the wood on the fire
I can see the smoke of desire
Let me in your dreams

Angel in my heart
Angel in my heart
