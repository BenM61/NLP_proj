I drove a tank in on the left, i hid a rifle on the right
When she said,
"I see a tunnel, and at the end I see a light"
"I see a fire on the water on the right bank and the left" 
(And she smiles when she wears the iron curtain as a dress)

CHORUS
I said come on
You're telling me to see the truth even with my eyes sewn up
I said come on
You're telling me to see the truth even with my mouth sewn shut

I see a preacher with a secret and he dare not make a sound
"I see the smoke and fire and the market burning down"
I se a tulip on a grave of a lover who confess
"I'm a soldier and a poet, but I'm a dancer at best"

CHORUS

I'm burning houses baby
I'm burning bridges baby

I drove a tank in on the left, i hid a rifle on the right
When she said,
"I see a tunnel, and at the end I see a light"
"I see a fire on the water on the right bank and the left" 
(And she smiles when she wears the iron curtain as a dress)
