There's no need for you to worry about anything
Who can say what the future gonna bring
But if you worry about tomorrow (tomorrow)
It will only bring you sorrow

Go out and have a good time (forget about the cloudy weather)
For this world is so fine (can't stop the matter)
Go out and have a good time
This world is so fine
This world is so fine

Hold your head up high
Face the future with a smile
Things'll be better, it just takes a little while
So when your feelin' low, down and out (down and out)
You're gonna shine without a doubt

Go out and have a good time (start thinking a little sweet)
For this world is so fine (if you give 'em your beat)
Go out and have a good time
This world is so fine
This world is so fine

Life is just what you make it
Can be good or can be bad
How can you miss something you never had?
When things go wrong don't forget (don't forget)
There's no need for you to get upset

Go out and have a good time (just go on out)
For this world is so fine (just can't stay down)
Go out and have a good time
This world is so fine
This world is so fine

Well, it's gonna be all right
I said soon one morening
Every-every-every-every-thing, everything is gonna be
