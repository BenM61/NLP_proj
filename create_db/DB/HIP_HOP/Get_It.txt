[Swizz Beats]
The kings back

[Chorus]
I got that get it get it 
I got that get it what you need
From soft parts to trees got that get it what you need
I got that get it 
I got that get it what you need
From dope boyz and bitches who love that road
Come and get it hey cause I got it bitch 
Tell and get you know I got It bitch

[Verse 1]
I got my broads if u want em
On the C.O.D please 5 G's
I don't promise but I got good numbers
Tote 2 thunder, sat that lumber
Got that guacamole holy moly you don't know me
See me clean as I wanna be, what these niggas wanna be
Shots so bright I can't see niggas standing right in front of me
These niggas don't want none of me, this rapping shit is fun to me
What I look like beefing wit you nigga yousa son to me
Move weight out to Georgia get it cross the water
Rive that shit to New York coming all the way from Florida
Dope boy trap nigga that's what they call em
Summer time balla when I buy the mall up

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Mighta seen me getting gas at the Citgo and he sit the six low
Riding right beside a 45 and what its hitting for
Shawty ain't bullshitin' folk he'll be out be here hitting folks
Stick around and try to tell polices what he did it for
Ain't nothing he ain't did before other niggas getting so 
Blurred wit the pussy and bet some even getting so
Long he ain't funny he got that long money
No money you niggas barely got hit the mall money
I'm the perfect example of how to hit the ground running
From the trap to busting up how the underground stunting
So you still see me down at the underground stunting 
I'ma Westside Bankhead nigga it ain't nothing

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I was raised off Easy, Cube, Ice T, 8Ball, MJG, Face, Pimp C
I'ma king just believe me, try me when you see me
And niggas start busting like they start busting pushups push a
Button shot calling niggas not balling
Just doing a lotta loud mouthing and not dogging
I got the shit locked from Atlanta to New Orleans 
Virginia Mississippi Kentucky I run all that
You niggas better fall back, boy grab a ball bat
Take it to ya skull, that's gone be the end of all that
Insist on having problems, bet dis revolver will solve that
Hit em in the temple then I leave em where they fall at

[Chorus]
