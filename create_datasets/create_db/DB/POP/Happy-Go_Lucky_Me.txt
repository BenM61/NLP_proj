I can laugh, woh-oh-oh, when things ain't funny
Ha-ha-happy go lucky me, oh yeah
I can smile when I ain't got no money
Ha-ha-happy go lucky me

Well, it may sound silly, but I don't care
I got the moonlight, I got the sun
I got the stars abo-o-o-ove
Me and my filly, well, we both share
Slappy go happy, happy go lucky lo-o-o-o-ove

We-e-ell, life is sweet, oh-oh yeah, sweet as ho-oney
Ha-ha-happy go lucky me, oh yeah
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha happy go lucky me
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha happy go lucky me

Well, it may sound silly, but I don't care
