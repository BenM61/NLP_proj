Do you, do you, do you do you wanna be

Do me a favor, pick me up, take me out later
Don't worry about no paper
Cause I got much stacked up for nights like this
My life can get crazy, I deal with shit on the daily
But baby I'm thinking maybe, we could agree to work it out like this

I need you (you, oh) to give me your time (give me your time)
I need you (you, oh) to not wanna be mine

Are you down to be a distraction baby
But don't distract me, let me ask you baby
Do you, do you, do you do you wanna be
A distraction baby
Do you, do you, do you do you wanna be
Yeah, yeah
Are you down to be a distraction baby

Do you, do you, do you do you wanna be

Do you, do you, do you do you wanna be

I need you to respect it, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sometimes this shit get me stressing
So I need you with me
To keep me right and keep me up all night
We can get faded
This life can make you so jaded
So we can stay shaded
Just to us and try to get it right oh

I need you (you, oh) to give me your time (give me your time)
I need you (you, oh) to not wanna be mine
