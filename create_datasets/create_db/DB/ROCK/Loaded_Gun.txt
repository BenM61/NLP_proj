What are we gonna do now it's lookin at you?
You got a beat on your rifle, it's called survival
And I don't mind if they see it all when you discover
That she's got a loaded gun

That she's got a loaded gun
And it's pointing at me
There's nowhere to run
She's got it pointing at me

I'm gonna hit on the town but I feel fenced in
Did you forget the way that you came in
And you don't care for my livid soul, and just remember
That she's got a loaded gun

That she's got a loaded gun
And it's pointing at me
There's nowhere to run
She's got it pointing at me

Well she's got a loaded gun
And it's pointing at me
There's nowhere to run
She's got it pointing at me

She's got it loaded
She's got it loaded
