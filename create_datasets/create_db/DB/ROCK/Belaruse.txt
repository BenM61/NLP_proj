Belaruse no longer feels the sun
But it's under the skin of everyone
Belaruse forgotten by the blind 
That is until the next time 

Remember all your yesterdays
In the deep blue 
Before the world came 
And rested there on you

And if the sun and moon 
Were both to doubt 
Then sure enough 
They'd both go out 
When you can't walk in your field
Feel water in your hands 
You've been touched by the doubt of man
