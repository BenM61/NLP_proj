As the colors fade away my love,
As the darkness turns to day above,
Celebrate the one you love.

And she says she has a friend inside.
Shows her everything she tries to hide
Please stop the pain inside

She don't know.
Please stop her pain.
I think she's coming down again,
I hear the rain.
She's coming down again,
I hear the rain.

And she's dancing with the hands of fate,
While she's sleeping with the one she hates,
And tonight they celebrate.

She don't know.
Please stop her pain, stop her pain.
I think she's coming down again,
I hear the rain.
She's coming down again,
I hear the rain.
And the rain still falls.
It's falling down on me.

She don't know,
Please stop her pain, stop her pain.
I think she's coming down again,
I hear the rain.
She's coming down again,
I hear the rain.
