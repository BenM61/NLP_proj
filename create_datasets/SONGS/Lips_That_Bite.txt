So when we're out there running all day who wins?
And when we're inside crying all day who wins?

I cut the hand
That shakes the hand
That shakes the hand
That shakes the hand, that shakes the hand, that shakes the hand, that shakes the hand
That shakes the hand, that shakes the hand
That wastes my time
That wastes my time
That wastes my time

With lips that bite
Teeth that bite
Lips that bite
Teeth that will bite you

Lips that bite
Teeth that bite
Lips that bite
Teeth that will bite you

Lips that bite

So when we're out there running all day who wins?
And when you're trying to find a corner to hide but it won't bend

It's about time
To get the arms, to get the arms
To get the arms, to get the arms, to get the arms, to get the arms
To get the arms, to get the arms
To take back my head

Well it shook me
But I won't let you rest
Well it shook me
But I won't lay down
I won't stay down
I can see you
There's always a way out

With lips that bite
Teeth that bite
Lips that bite
Teeth that will bite you

Lips that bite
Teeth that bite
Lips that bite
Teeth that will bite you

Lips that bite
Teeth that bite
Lips that bite
Teeth that will bite you

Lips that bite
Teeth that bite
Lips that bite
Teeth that will bite you
