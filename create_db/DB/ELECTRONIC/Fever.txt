Fading back into the night
No, nothing's gonna wake me now
Far away from what we are
Hold me up into the lights
Get back to where we started out
Fire away up in the sky

Bring back the Fever again
And don't lose the Fever again
Bring back the Fever again
Don't lose the Fever again

Fading back into the night
No, nothing's gonna hold us down
Leaving all the rest behind
Hold me up into the lights
Get back to where we used to like
We are lost inside our minds

Bring back the Fever again
And don't lose the Fever again
Bring back the Fever again
Don't lose the Fever again

Bring back the Fever again
And don't lose the Fever again
Bring back the Fever again
Don't lose the Fever again
