Dreams are a dime a dozen,
But oh what a way of passing time.
Dreams are a dime a dozen,
But you are in every one of mine.
They say there's nothing to 
The dreaming I do,
But they don't know how sweet it is
To dream about you.
Dreams are a dime a dozen, darling,
But I wouldn't take a million for mine.
