What do we call it now
It isn't marriage anymore
Call it new and different
It's not the way it was before

Out of all the words to choose from
There's only one that fits
Call it what you want to
I just call it quits

We've come down to the place
Where love barely fits
Call it what you want to
I call it quits

Turn and walk away
Across the desert of our hearts
Loves kinda said that we've run out of time
And though we once had something
No words could tear apart
Now you be your's and I'll be mine

We've come down to the place
Where love barely fits
Call it what you want to
I call it quits

Call our friends
And tell them,
Oh tell them that we just don't care
Tell them dreams of flowers
But our garden's bare

Call it separation, independence
Divorce, if that word fits
Call it what you want to
I just call it quits

We've come down to the place
Where love barely fits
Call it what you want to
I call it quits
