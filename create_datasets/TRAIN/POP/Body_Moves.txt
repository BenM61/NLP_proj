Side by side
Walking home, stumbling home, getting curious
What's on your mind?
'Cause what's on mine's a dirty mind
Why so serious?

Baby the stars above will light the way
Just take my hand and hear the words I say
Yeah, when the morning comes, I'll always stay
You gotta know, you gotta know that I'm feeling this, ow

Come and roll with me, we'll rock them body moves
Me and you (oh, just a little bit)
Body moves (yeah, just a little bit, ow!)
Coming home with me, oh baby, let it loose
Me and you (oh, just a little bit)
Body moves (yeah, just a little bit)
I don't need it, but you know how bad I want it
And your touch has got me haunted, but I like it
Come and roll with me, we'll rock them body moves
Me and you (oh, just a little bit)
Body moves (yeah, just a little bit)

Got all night
Show me more, a little more, it's getting scandalous
Yeah, all my life, yeah
Waiting for the girl next door to get real dangerous

Baby the stars above will light the way
Just take my hand and hear the words I say
Yeah, when the morning comes, I'll always stay
You gotta know, you gotta know that I'm feeling this, ow

Come and roll with me, we'll rock them body moves
Me and you (oh, just a little bit)
Body moves (yeah, just a little bit, ow!)
Coming home with me, oh baby, let it loose
Me and you (oh, just a little bit)
Body moves (yeah, just a little bit)
I don't need it, but you know how bad I want it
And your touch has got me haunted, but I like it
Come and roll with me, we'll rock them body moves
Me and you (yeah, just a little bit)
Body moves (huh, just a little bit), ow

Ha, that's right
Haha

Yeah, when the morning comes, I'll always stay
You gotta know, you gotta know that I'm feeling this
Ow
