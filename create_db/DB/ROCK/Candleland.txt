Get your handful of remembrance
For you to sprinkle through your life
In between the penance
That you carry by your side
With the make belief and miracles
That only come alive

In Candleland
Candleland

Wear your guilt like skin
And keep your sins disguised
Take some salt and sugar
And rub it in your eyes
You'll know that something's left you
Just as you arrive

In Candleland
Candleland

I walked back inside me
I'd gone back from my youth
As I came down the fire escape
It must have stayed up on the roof
They say you just know
And the knowing is the proof

Of Candleland
Candleland
Candleland
Candleland
Candleland
Candleland
Candle
The candleland
