I've got a message, I think the moon is falling
But thank God we're on the sun
So put the knife in as the night just keeps on turning
It's 6 a.m. but we've just begun

You don't need a reason
To get out on the dance floor
We can get it on and on
All night long

You don't need a reason
To get out on the dance floor
We can get it on and on
All night long

I am blood on the bottom of your shoes
You feel it, baby, maybe, hook line and sinker
I am the sun, you are the sinking moon
Definitely maybe, baby, no one to take you

You've got a message but all the lights are boring
Yeah, we're so shamed [unverified] under the gun
So turn the lights out, we're holding hands while burning
Your 21 and second to none

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You don't need a reason
To get out the on the dance floor
And we can get it on and on
All night long

I am the blood
On the bottom of your shoes
You are the savor, baby
Come, fight the singer

I am the sun you are the sinking moon
I feel it coming, yeah, and I want to take you

Ooh, oh, oh
Ooh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh

You don't need a reason
To get out on the dance floor
We can get it on and on
All night

You don't need a reason
To get out on the dance floor
We can get it on and on
All night long
