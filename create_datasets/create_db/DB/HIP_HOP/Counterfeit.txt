Freakin' me out you wear a mask called counterfeit,
 
You're freakin' me out you wear a mask [Repeat: x5] 

Freakin' me out you wear a mask called counterfeit, 
You're freakin' me out you wear a... fake 
Hey man wake up and smell the concrete 
Strange to see you've changed like the LB 

Could be identity crisis but I can't buy this 
Reality bites but that's what life is 
Pitiful you, your hideous behavior 
Hate what God gave ya, fakin all the flava 

Artificial minds seekin out the new trends 
Get in where you fit in 
Quit thinkin like a has-been diggin in my culture 

Let me let your punks know I'm an old school soldier 
With the funk flow 
A damn shame you want to change yourself 

[Chorus] 
Because you're sick of yourself 
Well I'm sick of you too, fake 
You're a, a counterfeit, fake 
You know we figured you out 
Well I'm sick of you too, fake 
You're a, a counterfeit, fake 

I wonder, I wonder 
I wonder what it's like to be a clone 
Doin' nothin, nothin' on my own 
Alone in your misery, you're bitin on my new style 

Filed as a counterfeit, going down in history as nothin but a copy cat (copy cat) 
So if your fakin that you're phat you need a ballbat 
Right where your head is at 
All your desperation causes separation 

Now I grab the mic to intimidate 
Your weakness screams from the limb on your siren 
Phonies get the hint quick smacked with funk flick 
Pain for the fakers fame can't maintain 

[Chorus]

All these phonies 
You disregarded your life (disregaurded your life) 
You disrespected your friends (you disrespected your friends) 
You've even stolen your appearance (stolen) from hangin out with my family 

But I should have never dropped my guard (shoulda never dropped my gaurd) 
So you could stab me in the back (stab me in the back) 
But you were faking me out (you were faking me out) 
Just faking me out you wear a mask (you wear a mask) 

Freaking me out you wear a mask called counterfeit, you're freaking me out you 

Wear a mask called counterfeit [Repeat: x2]

Freaking me out you wear a mask called counterfeit [Repeat: x4]

Now you're steadily startin to change 
You want to rearrange your lifestyle with live like the wild child 
With the vibe alive you could lie to try and be so fly 
A lie but you deny you're a fake 

You know we figured you're a phony (fake) 
You know we figured you out (fake) 
You know we figured you out, figured you out, figured you out 
Fake (a bunch of times)

You're probably freaking me out (a bunch of times)
