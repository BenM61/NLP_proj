Every time I have to lie it tears me apart
Every time I see you cry
It takes a piece of my heart
I know that I said never never walk away from you
I know that I said I'd always be there my whole life through

I got to walk away, walk away
There's nothing left that I can do but walk away
Walk away
Slowly turn my eyes from you and walk away

Every time I make believe it hurts more and more
There was a time I couldn't see, now I know for sure
I know that I can't help it if it hurts you when I say goodbye
Don't know why it has to be the way it is, I tried and I tried

I got to walk away, walk away
There's nothing left that I can do but walk away
Walk away
Slowly turn my eyes from you and walk away

Walk away, Walk away

I got to walk away, walk away
There's nothing left that I can do but walk away
Walk away
Slowly turn my eyes from you and walk away

Walk away.

I got to walk away
There's nothing left that I can do but walk away
Walk away
Slowly turn my eyes from you and walk away

I got to walk away, walk away
Walk, Walk, Walk away
Walk away.
