Everyone dreams about heaven
Nobody knows what to think
The truth is that I go to heaven
Every time you look at me

If I wait too long I may not say goodnight
Never knowing how or when I might just die

I?m yours
I?m yours
I?m yours (Heaven can?t wait)

Everyone dreams about something
Heaven can be anything
The truth is that my slice of heaven
Tastes better than my favorite drink

If I wait too long I may not say goodnight
If I take my time than maybe you will find

I?m yours (day breaks away)
I?m yours (no work, all play)
I?m yours (Heaven can?t wait)

Say what you will
I?m perfectly still
I?m sailing on a sea of sweet that?s you

If I wait too long I may not say goodnight
If I take my time than maybe you will find

I?m yours (day breaks away)
I?m yours (no work, all play)
I?m yours (Heaven can?t wait)
I?m yours
I?m yours (day after day I wanna say)
I?m yours (all play)
I?m yours (all play)
I?m yours
I?m yours
