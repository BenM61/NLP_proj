Early morning juices blend, he chooses
Bowl of seed, and water cleanses.
Caffeine free, with herbs for tea.
Clear and fresh, he won't be tempted.
High on see, he's staring at me.
We make us seem far apart.
Dead for a while, resurrects with a smile.
Pulls my conscience inside apart.

Green Man,
I'll take a leaf from your book.
Found a new love.
I say: peace, man.
Green Man,
I'll take a leaf from your book.
Found a new love.
I say: peace, man.

Second sight, no sense of fight.
He lives his life for the moment.
He stands like a god, an enlightetned god.
Ruby centers his crown.
Man of Wealth, loaded with health.
Alien, with a mother's heart.
Magic man, with your save-Earth plan.
Thanks for giving me my part.

Green Man,
I'll take a leaf from your book.
Found a new love.
I say: peace, man.
Green Man,
I'll take a leaf from your book.
Found a new love.
I say: peace, man.

Our body is a precious thing,
Treat it with care.
Treat it with bare.
As a snake sheds its skin,
You've got to shed your past;
Over and over.
Again, the more that you give,
The more you'll receive.
So give your love for free.
Don't live for the past, or the future.
Live now.
