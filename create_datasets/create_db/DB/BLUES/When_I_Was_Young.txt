'The rooms were so much colder then
My father was a soldier then
And times were very hard
When I was young 

I smoked my first cigarette at ten
And for girls, I had a bad yen
And I had quite a ball
When I was young 

When I was young, it was more important
Pain more painful
Laughter much louder
Yeah, when I was young
When I was young 

I met my first love at thirteen 
She was brown and I was pretty green 
And I learned quite a lot when I was young
When I was young
When I was young 

Pain more painful
Laughter much louder
Yeah, when I was young
When I was young 

My faith was so much stronger then
I believed in fellow man
And I was so much older then
When I was young
When I was young
When I was young
