The moon's high, stars shine, 
Perfect night
You're with me, there is nobody else
And it's all just right

I been waiting for this moment impatiently
I was anxious that it might never be
Then you called me tonight and my heart stood still, 
I guess you must feel what I feel, ah

Ooh-ooh-ooh, are you ready for love
Are you ready? I'm saying baby, 
Ooh-ooh-ooh, are you ready for love
I hope you're ready too, I'm saying
Ooh-ooh-ooh, are you ready for love
Doncha know you gotta be ready? doncha know you gotta be ready?

Tomorrow, stones throw
Not far from here
Darlin', we will make this night
Seem like a year

Such a whole lot of lovin' I've been holdin' back
I've been saving it for the man I lack
Now I know you're the lover I've been waiting for
And I won't hold it back anymore, ah

Ooh-ooh-ooh, are you ready for love
Are you ready? I'm saying saying, 
Ooh-ooh-ooh, are you ready for love
I hope you're ready too, I'm saying
Ooh-ooh-ooh, are you ready for love
Are you ready? I'm saying baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh, are you ready for love
Are you ready?

Such a whole lot of lovin' I've been holdin' back
I've been saving it for the man I lack
Now I know you're the lover I've been waiting for
And I won't hold it back anymore, ah
Won't hold it back anymore, ah

Oooooh, are you ready for love
Are you ready? I'm saying baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh, are you ready for love
Doncha know you gotta be ready? doncha know you gotta be ready?

Ooooh, doncha know you gotta be ready?
Doncha know you gotta be ready?
Ooooh, doncha know you gotta be ready?
Doncha know you gotta be ready? (fade)
