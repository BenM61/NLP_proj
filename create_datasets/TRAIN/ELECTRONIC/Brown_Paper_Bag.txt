"Step to the rhythm made out of brown paper, sounds entering of a different nature,
Rhythms get greater, And the rhythms they get greater, Yes another rough-a-tough
Four for the chaser, New configuration, New riff and New Structure
Built on the frame that'll hold the room puncture, Tight
We wrap it up, it's wrapped, tightly.

Mmmmmmmmmmmm

It lives, The bass is the army that it gives.
When we apply the breaks, There'll be no skids.
Just more elements to continue as we glide.
Dimensions & The Measurements and the evidence you will find
Change it, rearrange it so its regularly updated
Hits from every angle so expected the un-expected
Represent the fusion of the mind and stay connected
The star that is presenting, The size of the markers been indented

Delivering the style we give you so that means a mention
In your direction is the baron that we aimed, ascension
Instead the way the floor the stunner made a we invention
And then you get your moneys worth before you've even sensed it
Make you think a four figure for the whole nation
Send it down so one we know it with no discrimination
Like a safe with 50 locks, as many combination
No matter which way that you turn you reach the same destination.

The fullness of the spectrum, 360 keep it circling
Deep inside the flow is where its working it
Under lease, submerging it, time to make it go deeper
Way past the point that blows holes in your speaker
Under and over, take it over and under
First you get the lightning and then you get the thunder
The sound is the music and the music is the feature

Mmmmmmmmmmmm

Step to the rhythm made out of brown paper, sounds entering of a different nature,
Rhythms get greater, And the rhythms they get greater, Yes another rough-a-tough
Four for the chaser, New configuration, New riff and New Structure
Built on the frame that'll hold the room puncture, Tight
We wrap it up, it's wrapped, tightly.

Mmmmmmmmmmmm

Step step step step step step step step step step
Paper paper paper paper paper
Step step step step step step step step step step
P-P-Paper paper paper paper paper
Mmmmmmmmmmmm
Step step step step step step step step step step
Step to the rhythm made out of brown paper
Step.(Etc till end)"
