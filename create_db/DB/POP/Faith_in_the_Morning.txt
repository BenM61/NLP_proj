Too far, too far to turn around
And now your thoughts have slowed you down
Too many people go too fast
Too many people on your own at last
All occupied apart from you
With daily lives apart from you 
To fill a room, to fill a room how can it be so very hard to do
So very hard to do

you have a lot of faith in the morning
You have a lot of faith in the morning

above the ceiling, below the floor, eating sleeping doxens more.
Ignore them in the corridor, they are not the ones you're looking for.

you have a lot of faith in the morning
You have a lot of faith in the morning

sometimes I try
I try reaching out to you
The nights are long and so confused
But its so very hard to do
So very hard to do

you have a lot of faith in the morning
You have a lot of faith in the morning
You have a lot of faith in the morning
You have a lot of faith in the morning
You have a lot of faith in the morning
You have a lot of faith in the morning
You have a lot of faith in the morning
You have a lot of faith in the morning
You have a lot of faith in the morning
You have a lot of faith in the morning
