There's something about your smile
There's something about the way you make me feel
Keeps me holding on
It brings me back, you know the game to play
Back into your flame
Back towards the point of no return
To see your face again 

To point it out as no one else apart from you
keep drugging me with all the things you do
But you already know that I want you
But you already know that I need you 

So hear me, feel me
Oh can you handle me baby 
Oh can you handle me baby 
Love me, heal me
But don't turn me down no 
But don't turn me down no
Don't you want me 

So it is not that I don't care oh no
It's not that I don't give a damn oh no no no no I
And I don't think it's fair hey 

To point it out as no one else apart from you
keep drugging me with all the things you do
But you already know that I want you
But you already know that I need you 

So hear me, feel me
Oh can you handle me baby 
Oh can you handle me baby 
Love me, heal me
But don't turn me down no 
But don't turn me down no 
For I sometimes trust you
Oh can you handle me baby 
Oh can you handle me baby 
Love you always
Don't turn me down no, don't turn me down
Don't you want me? oh-oh
Don't you want me? oh-oh

So hear me, feel me
Oh can you handle me baby 
Oh can you handle me baby
Love me, heal me
But don't turn me down no 
But don't turn me down no
For I sometimes trust you
Oh can you handle me baby 
Oh can you handle me baby
Love you always
Don't turn me down baby 
Don't turn me down baby 

Love me heal me
Don't turn me down baby 
Don't turn me down baby
For I sometimes trust you
Don't turn me down 
Don't turn me down 
Don't you want me?
