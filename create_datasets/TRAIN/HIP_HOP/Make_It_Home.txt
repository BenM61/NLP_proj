I wanna go where the lights are low and the dreamers are chasing,
I wanna live like we don't know much but we know we're gonna make it,
And I don't wanna spend another night alone, (yeah)
I wanna go cause if we don't leave now,
Then we're never gonna make it home.

I'm living front row
Ya'll can take the mezzanine
Backstage chillin'
Treating life like it's a magazine

Seventeen and making money, with no doubt
Had a crush on Gwen Stefani, yeah no doubt
Like, woke up inside a new Bugatti
Just roll out
Nobody told me this was just a hobby
You know now
But if you didn't then you probably would have got it
I remember breaking even
Now we out makin' profit

I ain't trying to take the throne
But baby give me options like I'm Geno Smith
I tell them do it on your own me and Kina did
And now we trying to take the road less traveled
But sometimes the best shit's secret

So go your own ways cause I don't need it
I'm doing it my way so don't repeat it
I'm doing it my way so don't repeat it

And you can say it's just a dream I'm feeling
You wanna take me down a notch but this is more appealing like
I got the type of life that no one trying to mess with,
You got that McKayla Maroney bitches ain't impressed with, you

I wanna go where the lights are low and the dreamers are chasing,
I wanna live like we don't know much but we know we're gonna make it,
And I don't wanna spend another night alone, (yeah)
I wanna go cause if we don't leave now,
Then we're never gonna make it home.
Oh-oh oh-oh waiting til I make it home
Oh-oh oh-oh waiting til I make it home

I ain't a movie star, I ain't a ball player
But if you ask me what I do, I do it all player
I got these girls going wild like I'm John Mayer
And I don't need a damn guitar

Watch me I'm going far
Living out all my dreams
I used to live in my car
Now it's a limousine
I put it in the garage
Right next to my degrees

Hundred dollars for a hat
Trying to keep it supreme
I bet you're trying to fit in with your best friends
But your best friends
Made some bad investments

I wish I could but I don't believe you for a second
You said you living good but call me when the Mets win
The Mets win it in the pendent
Doing it independent
They tell me I hit a wall
They wondering where I'm headed

Busy buying the barn and busy trying to rent it
It happens when you sit around and wait cause you forget it

And I be playing poker with a blind man, throwing all my chips in
Working till I'm breaking every record like I'm Ripken
Dang

I wanna go where the lights are low and the dreamers are chasing,
I wanna live like we don't know much but we know we're gonna make it,
And I don't wanna spend another night alone,
I wanna go cause if we don't leave now,
Then we're never gonna make it home.
Oh-oh oh-oh waiting til I make it home
Oh-oh oh-oh waiting til I make it home
Oh-oh oh-oh waiting til I make it home
Oh-oh oh-oh waiting til I make it home
