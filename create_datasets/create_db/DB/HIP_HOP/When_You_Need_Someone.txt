When you need someone 
Sometimes it's hard to run 
Away from everything you're feeling 

I know that I want to be with you 
And I know that one day all my dreams will come true 
I just want to kiss you 
And show you how I feel 
Boy my love is real, oh 

All the times that you told me 
That you would never leave me lonely 
How does it feel to be rejected 
But I'll tell you again that I know 

When you need someone 
Sometimes it's hard to run 
Away from everything you're feeling 

I told you that I really need you 
So why don't you tell me 
Right now what you're gonna do 
About this feelin' I have deep inside 
Boy, I want to ride 

All the times that you told me 
That you would never leave me lonely 
How does it feel to be rejected 
But I'll tell you again that I know 

When you need someone 
Sometimes it's hard to run 
Away from everything you're feeling 

When you need someone 
Sometimes it's hard to run 
Away from everything you're feeling 

Now I told you, that I really need you 
So why don't you tell me 
Right now what you're gonna do 
About this feelin' I have deep inside 
Boy I want to ride, I want to ride 
I want to ride, I want to ride, oh oh 

When you need someone 
Sometimes it's hard to run 
Away from everything you're feeling
