You're gettin dirty at the club again
I'm usually round your waist like a chain but then
I got that call so I jumped in my car

I love you baby
But not like I love my guitar
Not like I love my guitar, no

You couldn't do it all by yourself
You had to go and get somebody else
Your high enough to call me
But your can't reach the bar

I love you baby
But not like I love my guitar
Not like I love my guitar, no
I love you baby
But not like I love my guitar, no
Not like I love my guitar

Oh, listen
Turn it up

Yeah, now dig

I tried to warn you that it's hard to be a star
Especially when your driving other people's car
I woulda gave you mine, girl, but you took it too far
I love you baby
But, just not like I love my guitar
Not like I love my guitar

I know you love me and you wanna be friends
And if you don't at least you need to pretend
We're still together even if we don't get that far
I love you baby
But not like I love this guitar

I love you, I love you baby
(Not like I love my guitar)

I love you baby and I wish you well (I wish you well)
I'll write a letter when I learn how to spell
Until that day, you can go to the... 
I love you baby...you know the rest
