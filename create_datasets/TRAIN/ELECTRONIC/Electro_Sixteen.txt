Sweet sixteen in leather boots 
Body and soul I go crazy 
Baby baby I'm hungry 
Sweet sixteen 
Funky bar all full of faces 
Pretty faces beautiful faces 
Body and soul 
Body and soul 
I give to you 
I'm an easy mark 
With my broken heart 
Sweet sixteen 
Show you my explosion 
Sweet sixteen 
Go out to the funky bar 
I get hurt, crying inside 
'Cause 
Everybody's so fine and, and they 

Don't need me 
Tell me what can I do
Sweet sixteen 
I give you my body and soul 
Sweet sixteen 
I must be hungry 
'Cause I go crazy 
Over your leather boots 
Now baby I know 
That's not normal 
But I love you 
I love you 
I love you 
Sweet sixteen
