Hey babe, how's your day been?
No, you first.
Oh, what, the day's quite bad?
Yeah, sorry

Where are you, I can hardly hear you
A taxi distracted, anyway you, you were saying
Wait, uh, love, they're waving me over
Can I call you back, yeah everything's fine
Why, am I, I don't know why
I probably just need sleep, it's been a busy week
Sorry, I've got to go
Sorry, OK, bye

This is just so unlike us
Come back to horizontal isms
If we could win just one small touch
Contact versus tele-miscommunications

Plan foiled, the sirens pass by
Kids screaming, the longest predicaments
Reach ticket, finally got through
Running for a flight, shoes off
You're calling voicemail

In joke, group laughter
Closing scenes, in a meeting
Angel, angel why didn't you tell me

One second, someone needs directions
Can't you see I'm on the phone?

This is just so unlike us
Come back to horizontal isms
If we could win just one small touch
Contact versus tele-miscommunications

So unlike us (unlike us)
Come back to horizontal isms
If we could win just one small touch
Contact versus tele-miscommunications

(Get better)
Did I tell you, I loved you today?
(Get better)
Did I tell you, I loved you today?
(Get better)
Did I tell you, I loved you today? (did I)
(Whoa)

(Get better)
Did I tell you, I loved you today?
(Get better)
Did I tell you, I loved you today?
(Get better)
Did I tell you, I loved you today? (did I)
