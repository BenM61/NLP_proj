Though I live on the edge time is on my side
all the doors to my life are open wide
just as long as the wheels keep on turning 'round
I will live for the groove 'til the sun goes down

living it up, living it up
I can feel it
living it up
is it a crazy notion?
living it up, living it up
I can feel it
living it up
I got forward motion

I don't wanna go to war, I don't wanna go to war
I said I know what I want and I don't wanna go war - do you follow me?
I saw a soldier standing in a bar
looked so tired he'd come so far
he said "I need to love someone, before they drop the atom bomb"

there's a girl at the back making eyes at me
and her hair long and black is a sight to see
but I get kind of scared when love's around
I just live for the groove 'til the sun goes down

living it up, living it up
I can feel it
living it up
is it a false emotion?
living it up, living it up
I can feel it
living it up
I got forward motion

so I'm a-taking you out but I'm a-faking
I'm married to the beat
but to the music I gave the heart I could have given you
still there's something 'bout the way that you move
and the way that people stare it's the shock of the new
I want my friends to see me standing next to you

the sun goes down . . .

time is on my side
I don't care what they say I'll enjoy the ride
but I get kind of scared when I turn around
so I'll stay with the groove 'til the sun goes down

living it up
living it up
I can feel it
living it up
I got forward motion

ooh - watch her dance
there must be one like her in every club in every town
but I don't mind if that the way she wants to be
there's something 'bout her that reminds me of me
she's my soulmate - we'll be together 'til the sun goes down

the sun goes down 

living it up
living it up
I can feel it
living it up
I got forwand motion
