Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
never get enough I'm crazy for your love.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
never get enough I'm crazy.

Ice cream couldn't taste any better;
your bad reputation, a mission that you keep to the letter.
A state of love can drive us all insane.
Why a man can stand for so much pain, but I stand.
You know the time is right, I feel my knees start shaking
and I can't stop running.

You don't know but the word is out
I go crazy for your love,
I breakdown to the ground, and I gotta shout
I go crazy for your love.

I go crazy when you touch me and I'm over the top.
Don't want to fight it and I'm giving up, lips all ready to burn,
don't need a doctor, nobody can save me.

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
never get enough, I'm crazy for your love.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
never get enough, I'm crazy.

I know, I know, I know, oh, oh, oh, oh,
I can't sleep, can't sleep, I turn the television on,
it's your face that I see on the screen replacing all the other ones.
I'm so blind, that every girl I see reminds me that I need to be in your arms,
the place is here and now, the brain is past controlling and the soul is crying.

You don't know but the word is out
I go crazy for your love.
I breakdown to the ground, and I gotta shout
I go crazy for your love.

I go crazy for your fingers up and down my spine,
come a little closer, baby, you will find lips all ready to burn,
don't need a doctor when I'm almost dying.

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
never get enough, I'm crazy for your love.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
never get enough, I'm crazy.

Lips all ready to burn,
don't need a doctor when I'm almost dying.
Gotta keep trying.

You don't know but you're number 1,
I go crazy for your love.

You give me feelings that I couldn't get from anyone,
I go crazy for your love.
You don't know but the word is out
I go crazy for your love
