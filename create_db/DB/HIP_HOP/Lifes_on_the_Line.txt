Nobody likes me
Nobody likes me, but that's okay
'cause I don't like y'all anyway

And I don't like y'all anyway
F*ck all y'all!!
My watch talk for me, my whip talk for me
My gat talk for me
Blat! What up homie
For bitches who don't know me

They want to blow me 
Cause the shit I floss wit sayin' a lot for me

I came into rap humble, I don't give a f*ck now
Serve anybody like niggas who hustle uptown
Coke price go up, cats is come down
The D's run in my crib, I'm nowhere to be found
The bitch who hustle for me, they don't even stash tracks
They keep it on em, right there in they ass crack
When I don't like a nigga, I don't pretend to
I'll have the paramedics wrap your fuckin' head like a Hindu
Look, I ain't goin nowhere, so get used to me
O-G's look at me and see what they used to be
I'm that nigga that sold coke, the nigga that sold dope
The nigga that shot Dice when he broke to So So
The thug, they pop shit
The thug that pop clips
The thug that went from three and a half to whole bricks
Nigga ain't in his right mind, goin' against me
My picture's painted through words that make a blind man see

Scream murder! (I don't believe you!)
Murder! (F*ck around and leave you!)
Murder! (I don't believe you!)
Murder, murder! (Your life's on the line!)

Y'all niggas don't want no parts of me
I'm tryna figure out how y'all started me
Make me catch her on the late night
Pop shots wit the fifth and slide off wit the six

I'm not a marksmen while spark issue, I spray random
Not a pretty nigga but my moms think I'm handsome
I hate to hear "He say, She say" shit
Unless he say she say she on my dick-
