Dreamy eyes
You've got such dreamy eyes
When I'm away from you
I'm so alone and blue

When I take you home
I feel so all alone
And then I realize
I love you, Dreamy Eyes

Your eyes hold a dream of a love for two
A love so warm and rare
I hope to see that dream come true
A dream we both can share

Dreamy eyes
You've got such dreamy eyes
And I see paradise
Within your dreamy eyes

Your eyes hold a dream of a love for two
A love so warm and rare
I hope to see that dream come true
A dream we both can share

Dreamy eyes
You've got such dreamy eyes
And I see paradise
Within your dreamy eyes
