Listen, girl, it's getting hot in here
And ya making me feel
Like you wanna do something, oh girl
What's on your mind?
I can't take much more of this bumpi' and grindin'

Don't stop what 'cha doing to me
Baby, you gon' make me want you even more
Act just like you want me, back that ass up on me
We can take this party to my place or yours

All up on me, playin' it close
You can't stop it, won't stop rollin'
Shorty, what you feelin' like?
You can come and spend the night

Oh girl
It's on in here, that belvedere got you open up wide
And, oh, girl
Since we locked eyes
Said it's so surreal that we both cannot fight it, oh yeah

Don't stop (said, don't stop) what 'cha doing to me (said, to me)
Baby, you gon' make me want you even more (make me want you more and more)
Act just like you want me, back that ass up on me (yeah)
We can take this party to my place or yours

All up on me, playin' it close
You can't stop it, won't stop rollin'
Shorty, what you feelin' like?
You can come and spend the night

(Bridge:)
Oh girl, it's that time
Feels good to know you're leaving here with me tonight
'Cause you're in the mood, so am I
And the sky is not the limit; we gon' see how well I give it, oh yeah

Don't stop what 'cha doing to me
Baby, you gon' make me want you even more (you make me want you more and more)
Act just like you want me, back that ass up on me
We can take this party to my place or yours (to my place or yours, baby)

All up on me, playin' it close
You can't stop it, won't stop rollin'
Shorty, what you feelin' like?
You can come and spend the night
