I don't understand
The way you take my hand
As we're walking down the stair
Out the door to anywhere
I think something's in the air

But I can't read your mind
Oh girl, you're wasting my time

Don't you know that you're taking your time
To make up your mind?
Don't you know that you're taking your time
To make up your mind?

Don't you know that you're taking your time
To make up your mind?
Don't you know that you're taking your time
To make up your mind?

I think somehow I know
When we dance real slow
From your attention span
That you're about to plan
To throw my guess in the garbage can

But I can't read your mind
Oh girl, you're wasting my time

Don't you know that you're taking your time
To make up your mind?
Don't you know that you're taking your time
To make up your mind?

Don't you know that you're taking your time
To make up your mind?
Don't you know that you're taking your time
To make up your mind?

Love's all we need
In the world to succeed
Love's all we need
Yeah, in the world to succeed

Love's all you need
In the world to succeed
But it's hard to find a pearl
In the heart of a girl
It's not the end of the world

But I can't read your mind
Wasted my time

Don't you know that you're taking your time
To make up your mind?
Don't you know that you're taking your time
To make up your mind?

Don't you know that you're taking your time
To make up your mind?
Don't you know that you're taking your time
To make up your mind?

Taking your time
To make up your mind?
Don't you know that you're taking your time
To make up your mind?

Don't you know that you're taking your time
To make up your mind?
Don't you know that you're taking your time
To make up your mind?

Don't you know that you're taking your time?
Don't you know that you're taking your time?
Don't you know that you're taking, take your time?
