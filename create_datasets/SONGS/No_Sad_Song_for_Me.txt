No sad songs for me
Soon our love will be
Just a memory
It's all over

I walk around, imagining
The way you'll say goodbye
And when you try to tell me
I just hope that I won't cry

No sad songs for me
Soon our love will be
Just a memory
It's all over

The glow has gone forever
Our dreams have turned to dust
I don't know how I can go on
Yet I know I must

No sad songs for me
Soon our love will be
Just a memory
It's all over

It breaks my heart to feel this way
Although I try to smile
To think I'll be alone again
In just a little while

No sad songs for me
Soon our love will be
Just a memory
It's all over

It's all over
It's all over
