Well you didn't have to come
If you want me here I is
Well suck it up, you little girl
'Cause its done for you and him
And you didn't have to come
If you want me here I is
But when you hold me, 
All you want to talk about is him

And he said la la la la la
Well he don't love you no more
And when you kiss me,
You just want to even up that score
And he said la la la la la
And you tell me how it hurts
But I like when you come over
So that only makes it worse
Oh, now I'm the replacement man

But I like you hanging round
And I wish when you come over
You'd forget about that clown
Now I'm the replacement man

Well I guess that it's my turn
But your heart belongs to that little boy
That ain't none of my concern
Oh, now I'm the replacement man
Oh, now I'm the replacement man

Well you didn't have to come
If you want me here I is
Well suck it up, you little girl
'Cause you're acting like a kid
And you didn't have to come
If you want me here I is
But when you hold me,
All you want to talk about was him
And you said la la la la la
Well he don't love you no more
And when you kiss me, 
You just want to even up that score
And you said la la la la la
And you tell me how it hurts
But I like when you come over so that only makes it worse
Oh, now I'm the replacement man

But I like you hanging round
And I wish when you'd come over
You'd forget about that clown
Now I'm the replacement man
Well I guess that it's my turn
But you're heart belongs to that little boy
That ain't none of my concern
Oh, now I'm the replacement man
Oh, now I'm the replacement man
