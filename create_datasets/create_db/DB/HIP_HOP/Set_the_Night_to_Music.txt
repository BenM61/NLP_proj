Set the night to music
Set the night to music

Look at all the stars tonight
Look at all the moonlight
Look at us we're all alone
Oh and it's just like a dream
Like some romantic fantasy
Darling come and hold me close
We could be making love
And with the slightest touch
We could

Set the night to music, we could
Set the night to music, we could
Do what we want to do
It'll only take me and you
To, to set the night to music, he ye he

We'll find a rhythm all our own
Melt into it nice and slow
Love ourselves away from here
Your heart beating next to mine
Perfect love in perfect time
Watch the world, just disappear
This moment is our to take
And with the love we make
We could

Set the night to music, we could
Set the night to music, we could
Do what we want to do
It'll only take me and you
To set the night to music, ooh oh

This moment is ours to take
And with the love we make
And with the slightest touch
We could

Set the night to music, we could
Set the night to music, we could
Do what we wanna do
It'll only take me and you
To, to set the night to music
Set the night, set the night to music, to music
(Set the night to music)
Set the night, set the night to music, to music
(Set the night to music)
Set the night, set the night to music, to music
(Set the night to music)
Making
We could be making love
Love
Makin' love
Makin' love
And the stars
We'll be makin' love, making, yes we could
The skies above
Making love
