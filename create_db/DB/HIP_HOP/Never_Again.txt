When the days are done
When you and I would take the world on
Yeah, to the place where no one knows of
Now I can't stop thinking about you
I'm a ghost looking for you
It hurts but it's true

That I will never ever see you again
And I'll never ever hold you again
In my arms, never ever again,
And I will never ever feel you again
But I will always love you the same
My girl never ever again
I wish we had a little more luck in love

Now you are long gone
But I still got your birthday card
Yeah, put a stamp on her address
Oh now I can't stop dreaming 'bout you
I'm a lost star without you
It hurts but it's true

That I will never ever see you again
And I'll never ever hold you again
In my arms, never ever again,
And I will never ever feel you again
But I will always love you the same
My girl never ever again
I wish we had a little more luck in love

Suddenly it takes me all along
To the point where it breaks my heart
Such a major love, never gonna touch again

I will never ever see you again
And I'll never ever hold you again
In my arms, never ever again,
I wish we had a little more to look in love
Never ever again
Never ever again
Never again
