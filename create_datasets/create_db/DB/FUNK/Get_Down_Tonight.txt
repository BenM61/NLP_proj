Baby, babe, let's get together
Honey, hon, me and you
And do the things, do the things
That we like to do
Do a little dance, make a little love,
Get down tonight

Do a little dance, make a little love,
Get down tonight

Same place, same time
Where we can get together
And ease up our mind
Do a little dance, make a little love,
Get down tonight
