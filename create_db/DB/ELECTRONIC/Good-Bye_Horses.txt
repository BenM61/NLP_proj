You told me, I see you rise 
But, it always falls 
I see you come, I see you go 
You say, "All things pass into the night" 
And I say, "Oh no sir I must say you're wrong 
I must disagree, oh no sir, I must say you're wrong" 

Won't you listen to me 
You told me, I've seen it all before 
Been there, I've seen my hopes and dreams 

A lying on the ground 
I've seen the sky just begin to fall 
And you say, "All things pass into the night"  
And I say, "Oh no sir, I must say you're wrong 
I must disagree, oh no sir, I must say you're wrong" 

Won't you listen to me 
Goodbye horses I'm flying over you  
Goodbye horses I'm flying over you
