What you know about love?) 
I know love is out of sight 
(What you know about life?) 
I think life can be so nice 
If I find somebody 
What you think will happen to me? 
Find a girl who can do me so bad (so beautiful) 
And teach her heart to sing (so beautiful) 
The kind of thing that makes you crazy (so beautiful) 
Makes you want to swing 
(How can you tell you got it?) 
You feel it right in your heart 
(Where should I get on?) 
It's never too soon to start 
And I've gotta find somebody 
To prove what you're tellin' me 
They say that love is a beautiful thing (so beautiful) 
Can teach your heart to sing (so beautiful) 
The kind of thing that makes you crazy (so beautiful) 
Makes you want to swing; go get it now! 

(Instrumental) 

(What you think about that?) 
Well, I think it's kinda nice 
(Man, they're really out of sight) 
I'm glad I took your advice 
'Cause I went in & got somebody 
To prove what you said was true 
I know that love is a beautiful thing (so beautiful) 
Can teach your heart to sing (so beautiful) 
The kind of thing that makes you crazy (so beautiful) 
Makes you want to swing 
Love is a beautiful thing (so beautiful)
