It's a melancholy moon, making magic in an empty night
It's a sorry serenade that's being played when you're not near me
And I long to hold you near me 
So my darling if you hear me 

Let the stars begin to shine 
Let me see them in your eyes tonight
Give the music back its charms 
Don't let these arms remain without you

Oh my love the world without you is a world that's out of tune
It's a sorry serenade to a mighty lonely me and a melancholy moon
Make it soon, here we'll be a mighty lonely me and a melancholy moon
