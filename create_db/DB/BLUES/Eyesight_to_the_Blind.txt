Wish to god, man, you could see mine 
You're talkin' about your woman 
Wish to god, man, you could see mine 
When she start lovin'
She brings eyesight to the blind 

Her daddy must have been a millionaire 
I can tell by the way she walks 
My baby's daddy must have been a millionaire 
I can tell by the way she walks 
When she start walkin'
The deaf and dumb begin to talk 

I remember one Friday morning 
We were layin' down across the bed 
Man was in the next room dyin'
Knelt down and raised up his head 
And said ain't she pretty 
The world know she's fine 
She start lovin'
She brings eyesight to the blind 

Hey, I declare my baby's pretty
The whole state knows she's fine
Oh, I declare my baby's pretty
The whole state knows she's fine
Oh, when she starts lovin'
She brings eyesight to the blind
