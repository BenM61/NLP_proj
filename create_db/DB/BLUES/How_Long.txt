Standin' at the station when the train come by
Deep down in my heart, baby, feel an achin' pain
How long, oh, baby, how long?
Baby, how long, baby, how long
Has that evenin' train been gone?
How long, oh, baby, how long?

If I could holler like a mountain jack
I'd go up on the mountain, call my baby back
How long, oh, baby, how long?

I could see the green grass
Growin' up on the hill
But you can't see a green-black drawin' on a
On a dollar bill
Baby, how long?
Baby, how long?

How long, baby, how long
Has that evenin' train been gone?
Baby, how long, oh baby, how long?
Baby, how long, oh baby, how long?
