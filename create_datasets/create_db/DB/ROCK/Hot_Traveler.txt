We suffer and dream
And ride on a steel blade
One more exit home

I'm relying on your senses
My equilibrium is failing
The hole in me, rips a hole in you

I didn't want to hurt you
I had to make a snap move
I didn't think you'd notice
But now I see your purpose

Stay up late with me
Stay up until the softness fades
And we're not afraid

The pain begins to finally fade away
And my own thinking has been blown away

What can you see?
From your steel hive
A thousand ways to lose your purpose
A thousand more to make it worth it

I didn't want to hurt you
I had to make a snap move
I didn't think you'd notice
But now I see your purpose

Stay up late with me
Stay up until the softness fades
And we're not afraid

Tricked by light again
Fooled by features in cannibal skies
This promise lies
You were right again
Stalked by creatures just beyond the fire
We need the light

(?)
Night eyes
Still hide

I didn't want to hurt you
I had to make a snap move
I didn't think you'd notice
But now I see your purpose

Don't hit the switch, don't hit the switch
Don't kill the lights, don't kill the lights

Don't look inside
Don't look inside
