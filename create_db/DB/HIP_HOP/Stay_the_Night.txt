Oh oh baby 
Immature's back back back 
Ooh ooh baby baby ooh ooh baby 
Romeo LBD and Bat  
You want to get with me tonight 
Oh 
 
Baby tryin' me givin' me, all your love 
I will never do you wrong 
Baby won't you let down your guard 
Then maybe we can go real far 

[Chorus]
Ooh ooh baby 
Say you want to stay the night 
You know you got a brother high 
I'll come and pick you up in my ride 
Ooh ooh baby baby 
Ooh ooh baby 
Say you want to stay the night 
You want to get with me tonight 
I'll come and pick you up in my ride 
Ooh ooh baby baby 

Baby, I'll be there to get you, around one 
So we can go chill and have some fun 
Baby, let's cuddle, 'til the sun comes up 
And baby, you know that I love you so much 

[Chorus]

One, two, three, get down like that 
You didn't know? Well understand 
We can move from the front to the back 
Watch me make you feel like that 
Make the moves, you don't like the rules 
Take no fools, if that's cool 
Romeo, I never lose 
With the girls I choose 

Immature's back back back 
Throw your hands in the sky 
Do you think we're tight?  
Hey ladies  
Do you think we're...  
Immature's back, back, back 
Throw your hands in the sky 
Hey girls 
Do you think we're tight?  
Oh baby 

[Chorus]
