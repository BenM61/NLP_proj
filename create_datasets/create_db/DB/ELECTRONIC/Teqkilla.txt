Johnnie keep walking, Jack does too much coke
Jim Beam and Jameson, they just gave me joke
When I see Pernod, I say oh hell no
Kahlua's a turn off, I tell him to Smirnoff
Captain Morgan, a shake with sparks
When we hang out, he shoots arrows through my heart
Blue tattoo, chillin' up in Malibu
He got 99 Bananas, but he's not my boo

I got sticky sticky ikky ikky wiiiiid
I got a shot of t'quila in me
I got sticky sticky ikky ikky wiiiiid
I got a shot of t'quila in me

When I met Seagrams
Sent Chivez down my spine
Got me on the dance floor
Then we start to wine
His ex Sambuka
She jus' a hooker
I put it on a chilla but
I want to quil a

I got sticky sticky ikky ikky wiiiiid
I got a shot of t'quila in me
I got sticky sticky ikky ikky wiiiiid
I got a shot of t'quila in me
I got sticky sticky ikky ikky wiiiiid
I got a shot of t'quila in me
I got sticky sticky ikky ikky wiiiiid
I got a shot of t'quila in me

Down the drain
Down the drain
Down the drain
Dddddd the drain
Down the drain

I got sticky sticky ikky ikky wiiiiid
I got a shot of t'quila in me
I got sticky sticky ikky ikky wiiiiid
I got a shot of t'quila in me
I got sticky sticky ikky ikky wiiiiid
I got a shot of t'quila in me
I got sticky sticky ikky ikky wiiiiid
I got a shot of t'quila in me

I got sticky sticky ikky ikky wiiiiid
I got a shot of t'quila in me
I got sticky sticky ikky ikky wiiiiid
I got a shot of t'quila in me
