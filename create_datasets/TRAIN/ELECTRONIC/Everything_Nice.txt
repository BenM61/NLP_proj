I'm feeling high, champagne fly
Work hard everyday till we reach to di goal
Dis a fi di people dem a work hard
All who gone to di morgue, R.I.P to a loved one

Thugs a proll out, girls a roll out

Hennessy pack up, refill yuh cup
Music a play till the speaker f*ck up
Gyal faint when mi click mi finger like Erup
She a wine unda rum and syrup
Reaching out to all who do 9-5, weh yah

Thugs a proll out, girls a roll out
Everything is nice, yeah
Everything is nice

I'm feeling high, champagne fly

All who gone to di morgue, R.I.P to a loved one
