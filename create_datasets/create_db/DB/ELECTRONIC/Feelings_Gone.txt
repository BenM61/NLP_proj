I never thought, I never dreamed,
That things would get the better of me,
But then, a shadow creeped just behind me.

Oh I guess, (I guess)
You can't run forever
On your own (on your own)
No, no

Tell me, tell me,
Will you walk with,
Just for a little while, (Just for a little while while while)
Until the feelings gone. (Until the feelings gone)

Tell me, tell me,
Will you walk with,
Just for a little while, (Just for a little while while while)
Until the feelings gone. (Until the feelings gone)

It gets so cruel, it gets so cruel out there in the world outside
When your standing, just standing on your own,
Oh, it seems like every awkward part, of your soul's exposed (exposed)
And I know out there, no ones on your side.

Tell me, tell me,
Will you walk with,
Just for a little while, (Just for a little while while while)
Until the feelings gone. (Until the feelings gone)

Tell me, tell me,
Will you walk with,
Just for a little while, (Just for a little while while while)
Until the feelings gone. (Until the feelings gone)

I'm not asking for you to fall in love,
For some great romance,
Just be with me, until the feelings gone.

Feelings
Feelings
Feelings
Gone
Gone
Gone

Tell me, tell me,
Will you walk with,
Just for a little while, (Just for a little while while while)
Until the feelings gone. (Until the feelings gone)

Tell me, tell me,
Will you walk with me
To hold my hand
Until the feelings gone.

So how about you, my shadow and me,
Just us three, just us three,
Walking on.
