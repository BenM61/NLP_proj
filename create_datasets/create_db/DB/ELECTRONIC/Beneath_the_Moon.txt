Over that mountain, straight down this highway
24 hours from you
Counting the headlights, billboards and raindrops
Somehow I'll get through
Crossing the border, no danger can stop me
Oh Lord how I've been missing you

Tonight beneath the moon
One million dreams reach out to a star
Tonight I'll say a prayer
And tell the world how lucky we are
Tonight, to be in love

I still remember that Sunday in Roseland
You came alone to the dance
I acted crazy to try and impress you
What did I know of romance
Two children searching for love and assurance
Each of us afraid in our own way

Tonight beneath the moon
One million dreams reach out to a star
Tonight I'll say a prayer
And tell the world how lucky we are
Tonight, to be in love

One mile to go
Oh the anticipation
Gonna hold you tight
Making love all night
'Cause I know how you feel
Ya hate separation
But I'm down on my knows
Please, baby, please

Tonight beneath the moon
One million dreams reach out to a star
Tonight I'll say a prayer
And tell the world how lucky we are
Tonight, to be in love
