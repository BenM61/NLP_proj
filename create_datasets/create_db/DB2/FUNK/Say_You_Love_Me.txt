Say you love me
Say I'm the one your eyes see
Tell me you need me
Deep down inside like I need you

You see I need you to see me through
I wanna hear you say darling, darling, I love you

So say, say you love me
(Say you love me) yeah, yeah (say you love me)
Say, just say you love me
(Say you love me, say you love me)

Through the rain and through the cold
Together we will never grow old
Sometimes the going will get a little tough
And I must admit living with me can be rough

But I, I need you to see me through
I get off when you say, baby, baby, baby, I love you

(Say) just say (say) just say you love me
Wanna hear you say
(Say) say, (say) you love me, oh

Ooh let me be, I wanna be your woman
Together we can make a stand, I know, I know
Let me take your trembling hand
Somewhere in God's country we'll settle on a piece of land

Because I need you to see me through
I just wanna hear you say, oh, baby, baby, baby I love you, I love you

Say, say you love me
Oh, just wanna hear you say, say, say
Say, say you love me

Say, say, say
Say, say, say
