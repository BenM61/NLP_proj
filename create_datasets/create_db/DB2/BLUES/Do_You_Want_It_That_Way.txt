When I looked around, I felt so low down
To find you in someone else's arms
Well, what could I do or what could I say?
But do you really want it that way?

If being untrue meant that much to you
I'm certain our love has lost its charm
Oh, how could you be unfair to me?
Do you really want it that way?

My love was so blind; my heart lost its smile
How hopeless it all seem to be
You nearly destroyed the love we enjoyed
Why should this happen to me?

If you only knew what I meant to you
My skies would never be so gray
Why must I say we've had a lovely day?
Do you really want it that way?
