I'm filled up inside a world of sin
But I don't know how it all begins
When my blood shot eyes are
Burning
And the devils thumb is turning
That's when I feel alive
That's when I feel alive
That's when I feel alive
Drunken times livin' high the
Devil knows
He says, hey brother, hey, you
Don't need control
Drunken times livin' high the
Devil knows
He says, hey brother hey, your
Gonna lose your soul
Burnin' down the road the devil
Grins
And baby, baby, baby, he smells
Of sin
When you're betting that you'll
Win
That's when you'll sin and sin
Again
That's when I feel alive
That's when I feel alive
That's when I feel alive
Drunken times livin' high the
Devil knows
He says, hey brother, hey, you
Don't need control
Drunken times livin' high the
Devil knows
He says, hey brother hey, your
Gonna lose your soul
