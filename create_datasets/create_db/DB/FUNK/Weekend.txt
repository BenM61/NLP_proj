It's the weekend hopin we can chill again sort of like we use to
'cause you know its over due
maybe we can if you ain't got other plans
I know something we could do
girl you know its overdue

Last time I saw ya we were together
do you remember times that we shared
'cause I still remember your simple pleasures 
the way that you move and the way that you dance
it's been too long much to long
and I can get you off my mind
so lets hook up like old times
hit me up with feets so right
