Take me
Into the fire
The truth is bleeding
Like an open wound
It's buried deep within
You can't escape it
Wherever you hide
It's gonna find you
Behind the eyev
Hollow
It's not forgotten
And all is lost 

No
See how they arise from my memories
Up from the grave
They haunt me
They taunt me
They won't leave me alone
And no
It's seems like they are here to stay, no
Up from the grave 
They haunt me
They taunt me
They won't leave me alone 

I was kissed
By a razor
A touch of life
For a change
And so much said 
But mouths are sealed
An understanding 
But no wounds are healed
Last breath and quiet words
All is forgiven 

The persecution is just about to begin
I feel their nails deep under my skin
This cannot be
Set me free 

Into the grave
I must follow
