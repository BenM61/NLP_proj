I should write a song about you
And all the shit that you do
You don't even know what's up
But soon it all comes crashing down on you
Since we're on the subject
Tell me why your name is in the dictionary when I look up idiot
Check yourself it's very necessary

Stop listen what's that sound
Supersonic spinning 'round
You don't mind the fall until your face hits the ground
Crash and burn girl
Going down down down down down
Crash and burn girl
You don't mind the fall until your face hits the ground

You should have a sticker on you
Saying warning keep out
You're the kinda girl that'll mess you up for
Life that's smashing up his car
Crying on his doorstep, waiting in the rain all night
And did you tell him you're the kind that never show your ugly side
Until you sticking like glue

Stop listen what's that sound
Supersonic spinning 'round
You don't mind the fall until your face hits the ground
Crash and burn girl
Going down down down down down
Crash and burn girl
You don't mind the fall until your face hits the ground

It's just that every time you mess it up like that I see myself in you
I've been there too
And there's so many times I stand beside and see what you're going through
Where you headed too

Stand by!

Crash and burn girl
Going down down down down down
Crash and burn girl
You don't mind the fall until your face hits the ground
Crash and burn girl
You keep on banging you head girl your shirt's all red
Crash and burn girl
You don't mind the fall until your face hits the ground

Crash and burn girl
You keep on banging you head girl your shirt's all red
Crash and burn girl
You don't mind the fall until your face hits the ground

Going down, going down, going down, oh no
You're going down, going down
You'll crash and burn girl
