I ain't an educated man
As all you Fleet Street preachers know,
It's just the simple things in life
Get my motor running, ready to go
If I can make you smile
I will raise my glass,
An' if you don't like it
Then, baby, you can kiss my ass!
You can tell me it's wrong,
But, I love wine, women an' song

Give me a good time woman,
An' a love potion bottle of booze
'Cause I got a juke box heart
Full of honky tonk rhythm an' blues
You better lock up your daughter, your sister too,
If get in my way, I'm gonna rock an' roll over you,
Ain't nothing you can do 

You can tell it's wrong,
But I love wine, women an' song
Wine, women an' song, talking 'bout
Wine, women an' song,
Wine, women an' song,
Wine, women an' song
You get what you can
But, don't take too long
Wine, women an' song, 

Give me a rock an' roll band
With a mean an' dirty blues guitar,
Take me to a dance hall palace
With a twenty four hour bar
Then you better lock up your daughter, your sister too,
If you get in my way, I'm gonna rock an' roll over you,
Ain't nothing you can do 

You can tell me it's wrong,
But I love wine, women an' song
Wine, women an' song, talking 'bout
Wine, women an' song,
Wine, women an' song,
Wine, women an' song
You get what you can
But, don't take too long,
Wine, women an' song 

Wine, women an' song,
Wine, women an' song,
Wine, women an' song
You get what you can
But, don't take too long,
Wine, women an' song 

Wine, women an' song
