I'm so sad, feeling blue.
Since you left,
I've been missing you.
Need your love, Oh so bad,
Realize everything we had.

All day, all night
You can have it anyway you want it.
One love, so right.
Don't you know that I live my life for you?

I was wrong, my mistake.
I regret, look at the price I paid.
Take these words, understand.
Try forgive me,
I'm a broken man.

All day, all night
You can have it anyway you want it.
One love, so right.
Don't you know that I live my life for you?

For you,
You can have it anyway you want it.
For you
For you
