In a wake of some change
Stones in the pipeline
Like some new mountain range
We leave the lowlands behind

They take your photograph
You come into existence
You realize it's your path
In this very instant

Some heroes are we
To pass outside these gates
With a will to adjust
Adjust to what it takes

You add another year to this
And it all has gone to waste
Other plans have been made
To pursue your own separate fates

The kids are on High Street
The kids will not sleep tonight
The kids got in a knife fight
We trained them well
They're gonna be alright

I'll be joining with them soon
I can't even wait to get away from you
'Cause it's only in hindsight
That we will know what was right to do
I always thought we had it made
Ambition spurred the plans we laid
