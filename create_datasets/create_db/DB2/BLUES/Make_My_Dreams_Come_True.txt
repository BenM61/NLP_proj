I'm in love with the one, she's in love with my best friend 
I'm in love with the one, she's in love with my best friend 
Well now we're really through, all gotta start all over again 

Won't you tell me baby, where you spent last night 
Won't you tell me baby, where you spent last night 
Well you didn't come home, until the sun was shinin' bright 

I got a fine lookin' woman, she lives clear 'cross town 
I got a fine lookin' woman, she lives clear 'cross town 
And when I'm with my baby, don't want no one else around 

Well I love my baby, tell the world I do 
Well I love my baby, tell the world I do 
Give me little love darlin', and make my dreams come true
