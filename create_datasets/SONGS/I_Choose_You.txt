You introduce me to life, that I've never known
When I'm by your side that's when I'm feeling home
And my only attempt is to make you smile, I promise
So believe what I say when I say I'm real
'Cause there ain't no mistake in the way I feel
Baby open your heart and accept this love, I give you

Over the others, over my pride,
Over the falls I have in my life
I choose you
I choose you
I choose you
I choose you
Over the others, over my pride
'Cause you're the best thing, in my life
I choose you
I choose you
I choose you
I choose you

Said I knew it was right, so I took the chance
Disregarded the challenge of the circumstance
Now your to big a part of me to let you go, I promise
So despite the way that I make mistakes
And despite the direction this love may take
You can always be sure of me just have faith,
Got you , this what is true 

Over the others, over my pride,
Over the falls I have in my life
I choose you
I choose you
I choose you
I choose you
Over the others, over my pride
'Cause you're the best thing, in my life
I choose you
I choose you
I choose you
I choose you
