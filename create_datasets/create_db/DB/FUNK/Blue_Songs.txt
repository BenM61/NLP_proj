She will say the word and vanish
She will say the word and disappear
Blue songs that are sung in the temple
Stories for all to hear
Lust was put upon my child
Mothers will hold their children close
Blue songs that were sung in the temple
Told stories of these ghosts

Lessons learned in temple walls
Water wash the children clean
Blue songs that are sung in the temple
Songs to keep the spirits green
I will write the blue songs now
Mine will sing the song unsung
Blue songs to be sung in the temple
Will be songs for the young

She will say the word and vanish
She will say the word and disappear
Blue songs that are sung in the temple
Stories for all to hear
