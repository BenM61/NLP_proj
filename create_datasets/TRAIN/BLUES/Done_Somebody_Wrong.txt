Yes, the bell just toned, my baby done caught that train and gone                       
It's all my fault, I must have done somebody wrong, oh yeah                       
Everything that happened, you know I am to blame                       
Everything that's happened, you know I am to blame                       
I'm gonna find me a doctor, maybe my luck will change, oh yeah                       
My mother told me these days would surely come,                       
But I, wouldn't listen to her, said, I gotta have some fun                      
Aah, I must-a did somebody wrong,                       
Uuh, it's all my fault, I must-a did somebody wrong
