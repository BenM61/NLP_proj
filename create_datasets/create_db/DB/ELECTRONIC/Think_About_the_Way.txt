Music is the vibe 
So open up your eyes 
Time is running out 
So find the feeling 

Boom diggy diggy diggy boom diggy bang 
Boom diggy diggy diggy boom diggy bang 

In mek Italian de Spanish an de Mexican 
Yes God put pan de earth all kind of man 
Japanese German and Columbian 
Chinese and de Russian an de African 
American Finnish and Canadian 
Dutch and de Swedish Brazilian 
To the Syrian the Indian and Jamaican 

Too many people dem a talk' bout peace 
But de war in a de world man it just cya cease 
Boom diggy diggy diggy boom diggy bang 
Unity a de bond an you know dat strong 
When you take a look pan de television 
Nuff gunshot and blood deh pan nuff programme 
Level vibe level an you know dat cya wrong true 

Think about the way 
That we live today 
Think about the way 
How some people play 

Think about the way 
That we live today 
Think about the way 
Think about the way 

Boom diggy diggy diggy boom diggy bang 
Milk an honey deh ina everyland 
But a who have it all dat a de power man 
An dem don't give a damn' bout de situation 
De homeless de jobless or de confusion 
Ina Bosnia Lord me know seh dem wrong 
Mek de future look good fi all de youth man 
To come through 

Think about the way 
That we live today 
Think about the way 
How some people play 

Think about the way 
That we live today 
Think about the way 
Think about the way
