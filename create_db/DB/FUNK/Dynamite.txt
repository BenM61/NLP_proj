If you try babe
I guess you can
Figure out who the hell I am
The Unabomber - bomber
Is my fan
'cause blow up is the only thing I can
Say the time babe
And I'll be there
Oh! I'm fragile baby so handle me with care
Oh! Action - Action
Can be louder than words
At least that's something that I've heard

Time bomb - Set the time and I'll be there babe
Time bomb - I can explode so handle me with care
So you know who I am?
I'm a time bomb pretty baby, yes I am
And it feels so fucking great to be me
I'm a high explosive bomb, I'm T.N.T.
Yeah! I'm alright
I'm dynamite!

D why N A M I T E
D why N A M I T E
D why N A M I T E
D why N A M I T E

Now that you know me
And my name
I still hope your feeling are the same
If you need action - action
I'm your man
'cause blow up is the only thing I can

Time bomb - I know that you will notice me
Time bomb - Loud enough to make the whole world see
Who I am
I'm a time bomb pretty baby, yes I am
And it feels so fucking good to be me
I'm a high explosive bomb, I'm T.N.T.
