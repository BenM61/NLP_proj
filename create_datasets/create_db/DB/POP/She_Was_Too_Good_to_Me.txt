She was too good to me
How can I get along now?
So close she stood to me
Everything seems all wrong now
She would have brought me the sun
Making me smile, that was her fun

If I was mean to her
She'd never say go away now
I was a king to her
Who's gonna light my way now?
It's only natural I'm so blue
She was too good to be true

She was too good to me
How can I get along now?
So close she stood to me
Everything seems all wrong now
She would have brought me the sun
Making me smile, that was her fun

If I was mean to her
She'd never say go away now
I was a king to her
Who's gonna light my way now?
It's only natural I'm so blue
She was too good

She was too good to me
She was too good to be true
