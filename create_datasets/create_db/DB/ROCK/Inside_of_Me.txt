I feel my time is slipping away,
(Every minute gone by seems like a day),
I'll never get back the things I lost along the way,
What the hell is wrong with me?
This isn't who I'm suppose to be

I feel all alone everyday,
And just so far away,
I know something's got to change,
Inside of me

What is it that I'm running from?
My head is like a loading gun,
Every thought is trapped inside this web I've spun

What the hell is wrong with me?
This isn't who I'm suppose to be

I feel all alone everyday,
And just so faraway,
I know something's got to change,
Inside of me

I feel all alone everyday,
And just so faraway,
I know something's got to change,
Inside of me
