Well, I kicked on my mule to parade me
Everyone else laughed and betrayed me
They said, "You ain't got the look and you ain't got the size
And you sure look like a fairy with those sweet puffy eyes"

And you won't
No, you won't
No, you won't
Get that load up stardom road

Well, there's managers and producers
And all the queens you need
There's (Incomprehensible) and there's juices
And there'll spaced out on speed

And when all the public see and when all the people stare
They say look at him riding his mule upstage
He ain't going no where, no where
He ain't got no, well, he ain't got no highway fare

Well, I kicked on my mule and he obeyed me
Everyone else, they snubbed and delayed me
They said, "You ain't got voice and you ain't got the chords
And you're living in bay's water on floorboards"

And you won't
No, you won't
No, you won't
Take that load up stardom road

you're nowhere, you ain't got non'
You ain't got no highway fare
No, you're nothing, you're no one, never gonna be anyone
You ain't got nothing

And you won't
No, you won't
No, you won't
Take that load up stardom road
