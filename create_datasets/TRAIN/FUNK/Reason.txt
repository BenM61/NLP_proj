You've given me a reason to love one more time
Came into my life and made up my mind
You are to me what I want you to be
You've given me a chance to love tenderly

And deep in my heart I knew you were meant for me
Right from the start it was like destiny

You've given me a reason
A reason
You've given me a reason
A reason one more time

I can't explain the way you make me feel
You've given me a love that's oh so real
You came along and you gave me a song
Now we have a love that's oh so strong

You light up my life the things that you do for me
And I'll be with you throughout all eternity

You've given me a reason
A reason
You've given me a reason
A reason
