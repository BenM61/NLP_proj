Yeah, yeah, yeah
Sole', never saw me comin', uh
My brigade, some bad bitches

[Chorus]
If ya get doped with bezels
Your neck, wrist and fixed clothes
You spit flows, your click roll
And ride with lorenzo's, say
Iy yi yi yi, iy yi yi (woo!)
Iy yi yi yi, iy yi yi

[sole']
Ugh, got these niggas by the balls
See me comin', drop the drawers, stop and pause
Hear me bustas, better drop the charge
Mothafucka, i'm about to roar

Spittin' at the sad nigga with the cup of dom, wha
These mothafuckas can't see me
You mothafuckas can't be me
These mothafuckas can't read me

You mothafuckas, you need me
Followin' with that who dat, it's true dat
Rip shit like a true bitch, you knew that
Call to my girls, we gon' do that

Any bitch that's havin' a clue that
9-9, time to shine, comin' with the fine rhymes
Line, line, hang it up, here comes
Mine's mine

[Chorus: x2]

[Miss toi]
Want to get paper due
Chicks mistake the doo when i sway through
Any nigga in the place gon' hate, so i make mom and pop and diamond case
So i be mucho luciano, true low

You know be	-o be in montigo bay sunbathin' topless, out in the tropics
Eatin' good, what's for lunch?
Crab licked, and lobsters
Runnin' with many cats, sole' (probably blazed out)

Get that cheddar, nothin' better
Y'all keep talkin', yeah whatever
Keep yappin', we goin' continue to make this party happen

[bobbi]
I'm fittin' to cake now
Check it out, break down
All ya dogs, startin' to act fake now
First album dropped, but ya ain't nuttin'

Bar slangin' for the take-down
Oh, you want to hate now?
Shut me down? f*ck why'all clowns
At why'all now, bust em down
Sole' evil, bobbi boss platinum bound

[Chorus: x2]

[Miss toi]
You irritating hoes don't stress me
And try to cop a fit, listen to my shit
And trick split when you show these suckas you ain't havin' it
Max to this, quit your dis, this a new chick, you familiar with

It's frequently comin' from this sis miss bitch
That's what i gotta be, my soldiers full on side of me
Oh they ain't scared to ride for me
All my niggas will die for me

I place these niggas inside of me
So raise your hand real high for me
Don't let no pussy slide with me
Oh, you think you gon' roll with me?

Just any ol' nigga can't roll with me
want to see your niggas ??
Don't need no monkeys sworin' me, huh
You feel the pain, pain?

We droppin' game, game
You'll go insane, feelin' the heat from this mic
Comin' real real tight tight, ah-ight?

[Chorus: x2]

[sole']
Ugh, bitches, now what you know 'bout this?
These niggas want to taste the best of licks
The led filled chick, that spit this raunchy led filled shit
See, i'm that "niggas want to eat me on my period" bitch

I'm serious bitch
That stray ho gettin' curious, bitch
Got kiddies shakin' in their boots, they scared to fight me in this
This pocahontas bitch got bitches straight re-writin' they shit

I'm iy yi yi 'n on this mothafucka, keepin' you lit
Got veteran niggas in this mothafucka ridin' my clit
See, tricky shine on this shit
Got nothin' but dimes in my click

And 2 of the baddest mothafuckas out here 'round on this shit
Think you come hard, come with it
Then hear me ballin', forget it
Don't put the mic down and quit
