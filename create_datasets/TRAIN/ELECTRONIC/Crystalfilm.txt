Lost my grip and my vision gone dull
I swing my hip like a dancer gone numb
I saw your shadow, saw the skeleton run
Now something's missing from my memory of you
You shake my world from my ground to my head
Distant noise that wake me out of bed
I listen as the walls cave in
I'm hanging on 'cause your memory's thin

I lost my grip, I balanced it on a piece of paper
True in one tip, it's weaving
And I wait for later
Who is leaning in on my yes to be?
Who is sneaking in, is sneaking in on me, on me?

I've cut a house in half and turn a frown distant
Painted walls and letters upside down
I try to hold on, I try to hold on but we gone
Then I try to let go but your memory's still on

I lost my grip, I balanced it on a piece of paper
True in one tip, it's weaving
And I wait for later
Who is leaning in on my yes to be?
Who is sneaking in, is sneaking in on me, on me?

On me, on my
