A man we passed just tried to stare me down
And when I looked at you
You looked at the ground

I don't know who he is
But I think that you do
Dadgummit
Who is he, and what is he to you

Something in my heart and in your eye
Tells me he's not someone just passing by
And when you cleared your throat
Was that your cue
Dadgummit
Who is he, and what is he to you

Now when I add the sum of you and me
I get confused when I keep coming up with three
You're too much for one man
But not enough for two
Dadgummit
Who is he and what is he to you

Well, you tell me men don't have much intuition
Is that what you really thinking girl
Or are you wishing
Before you wreck your old home
And search for another new

Dadgummit
Who is he, and what is he to you
Dadgummit
Who is he, and what is he to you
Dadgummit
Who is he, and what is he to you
Dadgummit
Who is he, and what is he to you
