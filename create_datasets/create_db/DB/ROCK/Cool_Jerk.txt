Cool jerk
Cool jerk
Cool jerk

Well I know a cat who can really do the cool jerk
I know a cat who can really do the cool jerk
Well this cat that you're talkin' about
Has nothing, nothing on me
Cause I know I'm the heppest cat
The heppest cat that ever could be

[Chorus]
Well they see me walkin' down the street
The say hey!
All them fellas drop to their knees
I'm the reason that they don't smirk
Cause they know I'm the queen of the cool jerk

Cool jerk

When way deep down inside
You know we're way cool

Oh man, she beat it mean
That mighty sound will shake the ground
C'mon and do your thing

A one, a two, a one two three four
You're playin' baby
