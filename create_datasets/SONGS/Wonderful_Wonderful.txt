Don't you listen to the never
Keep praying for rain
Dancing for rain little girl by the drain
Motherless child, rescue rescue
Don't you listen to the never
Keep praying for rain
Dancing for rain with your doll by the drain
Motherless child, rescue rescue

Keep your ear to the shell, keep your ear to the shell
Stay on the path that leads to the well
There are many take the one that leads to the well, rescue rescue
Keep your ear to the shell, ear to the shell

Motherless child does thou believe
That thine afflictions have caused us to grieve?
Motherless child angels have closed
Their eyes, thou wast thrown away and exposed

Don't you listen to the never
Keep praying for rain
Dancing for rain, no sweet for the pain of a motherless child
Rescue rescue

Keep your ear to the shell, keep your ear to the shell
Stay on the path that leads to the well
There are many, take the one that leads to the well

Motherless child, follow my voice
And I shall give thee great cause to rejoice
Motherless child, be of good cheer
My arm is reached out, I am here
I'll crush every doubt and every fear
Clothesline the shame and you will answer to the rain

Wonderful wonderful, wonderful wonderful
Motherless child I am with thee, thou wast never alone
Maybe I'm dirty, maybe I'm unworthy
Motherless child, can you hear me? I will give you a home
Wonderful wonderful, wonderful wonderful
Motherless child I am with thee, thou wast never alone
Maybe I'm dirty, maybe I'm unworthy
Motherless child, can you hear me? I will give you a home
You were never alone
