The iceman came to me tonight
So very near but out of sight
I heard the footsteps in the hall
And I heard a cold voice call
It's such a lonely world

Then I knew that you were gone
It came to me, I was alone
Now I'm left out in the cold
But the story's far from told
It's such a lonely world

It's like Latitude 88 North
It's so cold, cold as hell
35 below and falling
How I wish that she was calling me

Frozen shadows in the doorways
They will linger there always
And as the dawn begins to break
She's gone it's hard to take
It's such a lonely world

It's like Latitude 88 North
It's so cold, cold as hell
35 below and falling
How I wish that she was calling me

It's like Latitude 88 North
It's so cold, cold as hell
35 below and falling
How I wish that she was calling me

Latitude 88 North
It's so cold, cold as hell
35 below and falling
How I wish that she was calling me

Latitude 88 North
It's so cold, cold as hell
35 below and falling
How I wish that she was calling me
