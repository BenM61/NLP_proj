I'm on fire 
My emotions run so deep 
You vowed to love me 
Is that a vow you keep 
Your smile's so tender 
You'll not be sighing a sweet surrender 
Your touch is so pleasing 
Makes me warm inside 
Makes me feel I'm alive 
And I can't resist the heavenly bliss 
The magic concealed in your kiss 
Must realize what I see in your eyes 
Takes me beyond the skies 

Silent Morning, I wake up and you're not by my side 
Silent Morning, You know how hard I try 
Silent Morning, They say a man's not supposed to cry 
Silent Morning, Why did your love have to be a lie 

I'm on fire 
And you're my every desire 
A living fantasy 
And you know just what to do for me 
I love the things you do 
Here open arms waiting here for you 
Words you whisper 
Makes me warm inside 
Makes me feel I'm alive 
And I can't resist the heavenly bliss 
The magic concealed in your kiss 
Must realize what I see in your eyes 
Takes me beyond the skies 

Silent Morning, I wake up and you're not by my side 
Silent Morning, You know how hard I try 
Silent Morning, They say a man's not supposed to cry 
Silent Morning, Why did your love have to be a lie 

And I can't resist heavenly bliss 
Magic concealed in your kiss 
Must realize what I see in your eyes 
Takes me to paradise 

Silent Morning, I wake up and you're not by my side 
Silent Morning, You know how hard I try 
Silent Morning, They say a man's not supposed to cry 
Silent Morning, Why did your love have to be a lie
