Although music is sweet 
But the song incomplete 
Now in my life, 
Boy in my life 
Something is missing 

It's the truth, yes it's true 
Still there's no me and you 
Here in my life 
Boy in my life 
Something is missing 

In my life there ain't no melody oh no 
In my life there ain't no harmony 
To let me sing a song 
All I need is a cue when I'm waiting for you 
Boy in my life 
You are the melody 
Coz in my life 
You are the song 

Baby, in my life 
You are the song 
You are my melody 
To me baby, in my life 
You are my song
