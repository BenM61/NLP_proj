Merry Christmas, baby
You sure did treat me nice
Merry Christmas pretty, baby
You sure did treat me nice
Gave me a diamond ring for Christmas
Now I'm living in paradise

Well, I'm feeling mighty fine
Got good music on my radio
Well, I'm feeling mighty fine
Got good music on my radio
Well, I would have kissed you, baby
While you're standing beneath the mistletoe

Well, alright
Ain't that the truth now

Santa came down the chimney
About a half past three
He brought these pretty presents
That you see before me
Merry Christmas, baby
You sure been good to me

I haven't had a toddy this morning
But I'm all lit up like a Christmas tree

Well, I wanna, wanna bring it a little bit high
Well, I, well I wanna bring it a little bit high
Oh, I wanna bring it a little bit high, baby
No, wanna bring it a little high, baby
Little high

Haven't had a toddy this morning
But I'm all lit up, but I'm all lit up
But I'm all lit up, but I'm all lit up
Said I'm all lit up, I'm all lit up, baby

Merry Christmas, baby
Merry, merry, merry, merry
Merry Christmas, baby
