Tinie tempah,
And she, Kelly Rowland
Let's go

Invincible, invincible
Invincible, invincible
We're invincible

Ah, yeah they said we shouldn't, ah they said we wouldn't
Ah look where we are, we've done what they thought we couldn't
As bad as the odds were looking, push yeah, we kept on pushing
And every time I nearly hit the ground, you were my cushion

There's evidence that proves, that you were heaven sent
'Cause when I needed rescuin', you were there at my defense
Girl in you I find a friend, you make me feel alive again
And I feel like the brightest star, 'cause you made me shine again

No matter where we are
No matter just how far our paths may lead
We don't need no shields 'cause love is the armor that we need
We're invincible, invincible
Invincible, love's our protector
We're invincible, invincible
Invincible
We're invincible

Ah from the wildest water, ah to the highest mountains
Ah she went on forever, even through the driest deserts
You lift me higher than ever, I feel as light as a feather
And when we're fightin' together, we can take on the weather

I will keep you warproof, every single storm you
Ever have to walk through, I will go before you
I will be the voice when you need someone to talk to
Please don't ever doubt me, let me reassure you

No matter where we are
No matter just how far our paths may lead
We don't need no shields 'cause love is the armor that we need
We're invincible, invincible
Invincible, love's our protector
We're invincible, invincible
Invincible
We're invincible

It's you and I against the world
They can't stop us now
We've come too far
We've worked too hard
We're invincible forever

No matter where we are
No matter just how far our paths may lead
We're invincible

No matter where we are
No matter just how far our paths may lead
We don't need no shields 'cause love is the armor that we need
We're invincible, invincible
Invincible, love's our protector
We're invincible, invincible
Invincible
We're invincible
