Freedom come 
Freedom go 
Tell me yes 
And then she tells me no
Freedom never stay long
Freedom moving along
Freedom want
Freedom stay
Freedom love
And then she flies away
Freedem never stay long
Freedom moving along

Daddy is a doctor
Mother is a debutante
Pillars of society
Living in a mansion
Somewhere in the country
And another in Chelsea
Freedom is a rich girl
Daddie's little sweet girl
Pretty as a sunny day
Freedom never does do what
She doesn't want
To freedom never has to pay
Freedom come

Freedom is her name
And freedom is her nature
Running all around the town
Ev'rybody wants to
And ev'rybody tries to
But nobody can hold her down
Freedom is so kind
And freedom is so gentle
Freedom is a happy day
Freedom what would you do
If I say love you
Freedom would you
Run away
Freedom come

Da da da da da da (freedom)
Da da da da da (freedom)
Da da da da da da da
Moving along
Da la la la la la
Moving right on along
Da da da
