They say I'm going to burn on fire
(Yo quiero vivir sin miedo)
I'm trying to stay out of trouble
(Yo quiero vivir sin miedo)
Walk away from the mad man
(Voy a vivir sin miedo)
From the mad man that give me candies
(Quiero vivir sin miedo)

"You will never step into Promised Land
Cause God's land do not want dirty sheeps like you girl"
No I do not want to follow rules
I play my way, that's why they say "this girl is on fire"

Do not know where is my church
But I know where's my God and what he wants from me now
I know he's always on my side
Cause by a miracle I found an angel in you

There's an exodus to love
And I'm on fire
Singing I
You and I
There's an exodus to love
On my way to paradise
Singing I

Yeah, they keep talking 'bout prophets and losses
(Yo quiero vivir sin miedo)
But they never talk about the love of all
(Yo quiero vivir sin miedo)
They say the paradise is a far way land
(Voy a vivir sin miedo)
I was on Holy Ground when you took me in your arms
(Quiero vivir sin miedo)

And I don't want to wait, don't want to wait
No don't want to wait, cause now my soul is on fire
And we do not have much time left
There's a mass exodus of love
You and I, we're gonna walk in the frontline
You know I know, You know I know
The paradise is waiting for the both of us
Of us, you and I

There's an exodus to love
And I'm on fire
Singing I
You and I
Yeah, there's an exodus of love
On my way to paradise
Singing I

There's an exodus to love
And I'm on fire, fire, fire
There's an exodus to love
On my way to paradise
Singing I
Exodus of love
And I'm on fire, fire, fire
