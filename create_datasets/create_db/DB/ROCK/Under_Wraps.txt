Keep it quiet. (Go slow.)
Circulate. Need to know.
Stamp the date upon your file
 masquerade, but well worth while.

Wrapped in the warmth of you 
 wrapped up in your smile.
Wrapped in the folds of your attention.

Wear an air (keep mum)
 of casual indifference.
Careful how you go
 about your usual business.

Wrapped in daydreams of you 
 wrapped up by your eyes.
Wrapped in the folds of your attention.
Under wraps! I've got you under wraps.

Tell you when (not yet)
 soon the great unveiling.
Bless my boots! Upon my soul!
Secrecy, it is my failing.

Wrapped in your Summer night 
 wrapped in your Autumn leaves.
Wrapped in the Winter of your sleeping.
