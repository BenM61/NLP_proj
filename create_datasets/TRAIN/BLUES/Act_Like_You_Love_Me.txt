baby that's all right for you
you treat me mean
that's the way you do
if you love me call me on the phone sometime
to you hear your voice ease my worryin mind
one of these days i'm going to show you how nice i can be
the love i got for you swear is good for me
the sun is gonna shine in my front door someday
the wind is gonna ride all my troubles away
