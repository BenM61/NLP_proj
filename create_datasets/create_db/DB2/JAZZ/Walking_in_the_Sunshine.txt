After the rain goes, people see rainbows
But I see rainbows when it storms above
So, darling, is it any wonder I can laugh at thunder
Walking in the sunshine of your love?

And below zero, I'm such a hero
I never wear a muffler or a glove
While all the world have frosty noses, I'm knee-deep in roses
Walking in the sunshine of your love

Just so you know, dear, I'm gonna tell you
Your smile's my golden umbrella
Even the rain-out, trouble, and pain out of my heart
And from the very start your tender affection in my direction
T'was like a lovely blessing from above
That's why I go around just beaming, wondering if I'm dreaming
Walking in the sunshine of your love

So, baby, is it any wonder I can laugh at thunder
Walking in the sunshine of your love?

And below zero, I'm such a hero
I never wear a muffler or a glove
While all the world have frosty noses, I'm knee-deep in roses

That's why I go around just beaming, wondering if I'm dreaming
I'm walking, walking in the sunshine of your love
Yeah, baby, you keep me and warm
