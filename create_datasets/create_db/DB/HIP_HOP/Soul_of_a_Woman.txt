This song is dedicated
To all the brothers out there
Who've ever loved a woman
Whether it was your mother

Whether it was a lover 
Or whether it was your daughter
In every woman lies a soul
And in the soul of every woman

Lies the secrets of love
And sometimes 
You don't do right by her
But the way back to her heart

Lives in that same soul
You just have to find it....

So pure, Mmmm
There through thick and thin
No shame in showing 
She is your best friend

So strong
And though you've let her down
You won't see her frown
But make it right and look inside

You will find 
She was everything your heart desired
But nevertheless, she cries
But you never cherished her
And you took for granted love

You sigh 
Remembering the times she made you smile
And knowing that down inside
She was the only one
Who'd love you forever more

[Chorus]
In her soul you'll find
The way to bring her back into your world
Grown mind
But she's just a precious little girl
In her soul you'll find
The things that made your life seem so worthwhile
Then you can give it in return

So real, Mmm
The way she'll sacrifice
Only for you 
To have the best in life

Been too long
You need to let her know
You want to make it right
You gotta touch her soul to find

You will find 
She was everything your heart desired
But nevertheless, she cries
But you never cherished her
And you took for granted love

You sigh 
Remembering the times she made you smile
And knowing that down inside
She was the only one
Who'd love you forever more

[Chorus]

(You can't buy)
Can never buy her love
Can never buy her love
'Cause money just won't fill the void

You made oh no
You want to have her love
You've gotta earn her love
Her soul will lead the way
And show you where to go

[Chorus: x2]
