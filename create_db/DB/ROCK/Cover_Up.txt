Lost yourself in the couch
Swimming with all the change again
Waking up indifferent day after day
Just one constant slap in the face keeps you awake
Waking up inside bleeding through the eyes
Caught up confused all the anchors sigh
Strapped to the floor
Nothing left to lose
Now that you've got a trail to cover up,
Why are you whispering to me?
And deep inside my room there's no such thing as light
Passing through these bars
Talk out loud so I can hear your voice scattered clearly
Lungs breathing evenly
Often I sleep
And often you'll leave
Just one more reminder keeps you wandering
Waking up inside bleeding through the eyes
Caught up confused all the anchors sigh
Strapped to the floor
Nothing left to lose
Now that you've got a trail to cover up,
Why are you whispering to me?
And deep inside my room there's no such thing as light
Passing through these bars
Wax candles selling out the room.
While the eyes have theirs is not to be confused
Change your name
Change your name
