My love, my, my love
My love, my, my love
My love, my, my love
My love, my, my love

My love, my, my love
My love, my, my love
My love, my, my love

Oh my love, your love is like a flame I'd never blow
A song that I've always known
Higher than I've ever been before, my love

Oh my love, your love is like a dream can be awake
I'm taking a leap of faith
I took a turn but I don't want away, my love

And when we're close, you know I feel passion
In the eye of your fatal attraction
My main attraction, a chain reaction
And when we touch, we beat, it's automatic
I've become obsessive, informatic
Systematic, gotta have it, my love

And when we're close, you know I feel passion
In the eye of your fatal attraction
My main attraction, a chain reaction
And when we touch, we beat, it's automatic
I've become obsessive, informatic
Systematic, gotta have it

And when we're close, you know I feel passion
In the eye of your fatal attraction
My main attraction, a chain reaction
And when we touch, we beat, it's automatic
I've become obsessive, informatic
Systematic, gotta have it, my love

And when we're close, you know I feel passion
In the eye of your fatal attraction
My main attraction, a chain reaction
And when we touch, we beat, it's automatic
I've become obsessive, informatic
Systematic, gotta have it

My love, my, my love
My love, my, my love
My love, my, my love
And when we're close I feel with you (oh oh oh oh)

Oh my love, you don't know what you do or mean to me
Your presence is a fantasy
It's never nothing short of ecstasy, my love

Oh my love, it's a feeling that can't be described
Oh my love, shared between only you and I
My love, too much seldom seems to be enough, my love

And when we're close, you know I feel passion
In the eye of your fatal attraction
My main attraction, a chain reaction
And when we touch, we beat, it's automatic
I've become obsessive, informatic
Systematic, gotta have it, my love

And when we're close, you know I feel passion
In the eye of your fatal attraction
My main attraction, a chain reaction
And when we touch, we beat, it's automatic
I've become obsessive, informatic
Systematic, gotta have it

My love, my, my love
My love, my, my love
My love, my, my love
My love, my, my love

And when we're close I feel with you (oh oh oh oh)
