Rap stack, spectacular with the vernacular
Stealth from a killing spree, they call be Blackula
Step back, get your neck fractured by the rapture
Get choked out to the beat by the manufacturer

And I ain't here to laugh at you, I'm just here to mash
Like potatoes, flush your fucking flow down the drain yo
Let's get it on, let's get it gully, get it ugly
East New York nigga, we get it muddy, feel this

I'm hittin' with sound, with the sound of a tre pound
That knock niggaz down, then run clowns outta town
My malls taller than skyscrapers, you catchin' the vapors
You only got a pair of jacks, I got a pair of aces

As a matter of fact, I left a pool of bb's on your girl's face, kid
Slap the taste out your mouth from the Boogie Down
To the southern most tempted down south
There's six million ways to kill a pussy, wanna count?

I never fake no moves, I just do my thing
(Do my thing, now watch me do my thing, now)
I never fake no moves, I just do my thing
(Do my thing, do my thing)

When I step up in the studio, rollin' dolo
With the bolo, mandingo, stunnin' mojo
Que paso? I be the sharpest capolo
I ride over the ruggedest tracks like a Tahoe

Maybe a bronco or even a durango
I MC for life, that's right, I do my thing, yo
Bang bang yo, back 'em on the chain gang
Yo, I wanna spit it for my people so I can let 'em know

I never ripped it to show off that I'm nicest
My instinct, is in sync plus it's timeless
And the light I shine dog is ultraviolet
A night catch a sun tan man where my rhyme hits

My soul glow is unstoppable, unrockable
I'm light weight but I can put you in the hospital
Hittin' up the collective or individuals
I'm like an eighth covered in crystal, I'm gonna hit you

I never fake no moves, I just do my thing
(Do my thing, now watch me, do my thing, now)
I never fake no moves, I just do my thing
(Do my thing, do my thing)

I never fake no moves, I just do my thing
(Do my thing, now watch me do my thing, now)
I never fake no moves, I just do my thing
(Do my thing, do my thing)

Oh, oh, so I'm the shit huh, now I'm Down like a Black Hawk
Everywhere I go, like I'm walking on the catwalk
I wax it and tax it, I'm doing the kungfu kick
Holding my dick like Michael Jackson

Yowser, yowser, yowser, the more you can bounce to count
That everybody feel the power, you know
I step on the stage, my mic like a light saber
Blast through the Seran Vega then I jump off the wall

As I take it to your face like Vega
Now who wanna contest the champion sound
With the crown from the underground ready to fuckin' put it down
Parallel or perpendicular, you couldn't get with the

Lyrical elixir, I be the victorious
And bless the mic so glorious
And go 'head and dust off your rust
I leave you stiff as a statue boy, standing in the dust

I never fake no moves, I just do my thing
(Do my thing, now watch me do my thing, now)
I never fake no moves, I just do my thing
(Do my thing, do my thing)

I never fake no moves, I just do my thing
(Do my thing, now watch me do my thing, now)
I never fake no moves, I just do my thing
(Do my thing, do my thing)

Do my thing, now watch me do my thing, now
Do my thing, thing, do my thing
Do my thing, now watch me do my thing, now
Do my thing, thing, do my thing
