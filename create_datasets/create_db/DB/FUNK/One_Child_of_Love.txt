One child that's born in peace
One babe that knows no war
That's what we live to see
That's what we're praying for
A healthy and a happy one, born with no misery
A child that's so full of fun
And just as free as he wants to be

And we'll give him peace with all we can give
And we'll give him hope with each day we'll live
And our dream will be
This world will see one child of love
One child of love

Love that is deep and true makes life so precious too
And when love means more with time
We'll conquer all
And we'll make each climb
And all we want is a healthy one, born with no misery
A child that's so full of fun
And just as free as he wants to be

And we'll give him peace with all we can give
And we'll give him hope with each day we'll live
And our dream will be
This world will see one child of love
One child of love

One child that's born in peace
One babe that knows no war
That's what we live to see
That's what we're praying for
A healthy and a happy one, born with no misery
A child that's so full of fun
And just as free as he wants to be

And we'll give him peace with all we can give
And we'll give him hope with each day we'll live
And our dream will be
This world will see one child of love
One child of love
