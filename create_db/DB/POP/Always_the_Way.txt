Your smile was so disarming
You'd better mind your own affair
Picking up the pieces of a life that shone in tatters
You're gonna come back if you dare

Ain't it always the way?
You get just one chance
Ain't it always the way?
Ain't it always the way?

You'd better learn to mind your business
Watch out for your own, sail your boat on placid bays
You'd better learn to keep the big ship
On the straight and narrow, let the first mate cast away

Ain't it always the way?
You get just one chance
Ain't it always the way?
Ain't it always the way?

And then along comes the day
And then along comes the day

Be a winner, a dead ringer for the truth
Will the circle be unbroken?
Be a master of your destiny
This is not a joke

Ain't it always the way?
You get just one chance
Ain't it always the way?
Ain't it always the way?

Always the way
