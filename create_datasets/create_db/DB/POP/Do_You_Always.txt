I wake to the sound of a far away thunder
Wondering why
This secret in your heart
Why don't you let me share your thoughts
Something strange is going on
Maybe something you've gone through
So often sadness in your eyes
I don't know what to do, I don't know what to

Do you always have to be alone
Just by yourself, just you alone
Why don't you let me in
Do you have always have to go away
So far away, so far away
Why can't you stay

In a place of refuge where no one's allowed
Somewhere up north
Where no helping hands will reach you
In your silent desert land
As captain of a peaceful phantom ship
In a proud and senseless soul
How am I supposed to help you
I don't know what to do, I don't know what to

Do you always have to be alone
Just by yourself, just you alone
Why don't you let me in
Do you always have to go away
So far away, so far away
Why can't you stay 

How am I supposed to help you
When you're in your desert land
How am I supposed to help you
I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do

Do you always have to be alone
Just by yourself, just you alone
Why don't you let me in
Do you always have to go away
So far away, so far away
Why can't you stay
Why can't you stay
Why can't you stay
