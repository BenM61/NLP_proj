My ghosts and monsters
They wake me every night
Sharp teeth and bad breath
Whispering your name

I'm not quite lonely
Feels more like scared to death
your memory haunts me 
When I put myself to bed

I've been sleeping with the lights on
Talking in my sleep 
And waking to an empty home
I've been sleeping with the lights on 
Since you've been gone

Bela Lugosi
And Boris Karloff too
Make such strange bedfellows
But how to they know you

They'll stay for hours
They'll haunt me all night long
Talk about you new love
'Til the crack of dawn
I know you're not to blame
For the shape I'm in 
it's the nature of the beast
But how do I explain 
When it's time to love again
The monsters are real
