When the rain is pattering Helter Skelter
And the butterflies are caught out in the rain
Leafy hollyhocks would murmur come and shelter
Until the rainbow shines again

In the heart of every roses apron
From the pitter patter pitter pat refrain
There's protection from the showers
From the sympathetic flowers
For the butterflies in the rain

Pretty things, you'll have to fold your wings
Waiting for the bright and placid sun showers
`Neath the broad protection of the sunflowers
Gone the rain, the sky is clear again
You can carry on your sweet flirtation
With every blushing rose
