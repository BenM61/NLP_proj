You are the love of my life
I knew it right from the start
The moment I looked at you
You found a place in my heart

You are the love of my life
You give me reason to live
You taught me how to be strong
With you is where I belong

No one's ever touched me
Quite the way you touched me
People search a lifetime
To find what we have

You are the love of my life
One thing that's good in this life
I'll spend the rest of my days
Just loving you

You are the love of my life
The heart and soul of my life
Once I was lost and alone
With you at last I am home

You give me so much of you
And leave me room to be free

No one's ever touched me
Quite the way you touched me
People search a lifetime
To find what we have

You are the love of my life
One thing that's good in this life 
And in a world full of change
One thing I'm sure of

You are the love of my life
The one thing that makes sense in this life
I'll spend the rest of my days
Just loving you

You are the love of my life
And I thank god I'm alive
To spend my lifetime with you
You are the love of my life
