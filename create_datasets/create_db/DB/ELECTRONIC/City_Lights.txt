Freefalling
Deep through the clouds, hm
Keep falling
Feet off the ground

If all you want is fire, fire, fire
Then watch me burn like the city lights, yeah
If all you want is fire, fire
Keep watching me
Keep watching me
Keep watching me
Keep watching me
Keep watching

If all you want is fire, fire, fire
Then watch me burn like the city lights, yeah
If all you want is fire, fire, fire
Then watch me burn like the city lights, yeah

Freefalling
Deep through the clouds (Yeah, keep watching me)
Keep falling
Feet off the ground

(Keep watching me)

Freefalling
Deep through the clouds, hm
Keep falling
Feet off the ground

You better watch me burn

If all you want is fire, fire, fire
Then watch me burn like the city lights
If all you want is fire, fire, fire
Then watch me burn like the city lights, yeah

Freefalling
