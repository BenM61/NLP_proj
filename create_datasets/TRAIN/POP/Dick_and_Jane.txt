Look, Dick look, look at Jane
See Jane laugh and play
Look, Dick look, see pretty Jane
I'm gonna marry her someday

I've loved her since we were children
Back in grammar school
Loved her then and I always will
Though I know I'm just a fool

Then one day I kissed her
But it was all in vain
Cause I was at their reception
To have fun with Dick and Jane

Look, Dick look, look at Jane
See Jane laugh and play
Look, Dick look, see pretty Jane
I'm gonna marry her someday

Time has turned some pages
Since they moved away
I think back in stage
Of the way she'd laugh and play

Today I received a letter
That she has passed away
So one last time I kissed her
By the flowers where she'll lay

Look, Dick look, look at Jane
See Jane laugh and play
Look, Dick look, see pretty Jane
I'm gonna marry her someday
