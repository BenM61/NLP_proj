I belong, I belong, I belong

Since half my life
My heart's been sleeping
For all this time
My love's been keeping

And now my heart has recovered
From past affairs that turned wrong
All my dreams are uncovered
I belong, I belong, I belong

At first I thought
Just one more lover
But then I found
Why he's like no other

And now my heart has recovered
From past affairs that turned wrong
All my dreams are uncovered

I belong, I belong, I belong

Too many hours slipped away
Too many loves came my way
But they only broke my heart in two
All it needs is someone just like you

At last you came
And from now on
The two of us
Will be as one

'Cause now my heart has recovered
From past affairs that turned wrong
All my dreams are uncovered
I belong, I belong, I belong

I belong
