We are the earth intruders
We are the earth intruders
Muddy with twigs and branches

Turmoil, carnage

Here come the earth intruders
We are the paratroopers
Stampede of sharpshooters
Come straight from voodoo

With our feet thumping
With our feet marching
Grinding skeptics into the soil

Shower of goodness
Coming to end the doubt pouring over
Shower of goodness coming to end

We are the earth intruders
We are the sharp shooters
Flock of parashooters
Necessary voodoo

I have guided my bones
Through some voltage
And loved them still
And loved them too

Metallic carnage
Ferocity
Feel the speed

We are the earth intruders
We are the sharp shooters
Flock of parashooters
Necessary voodoo

There is turmoil out there
Carnage, rambling

What is to do but dig
Dig bones out of earth
Mudgraves, timber
Morbid trenches

Here come the earth intruders
Stampede of resistance
We are the canoneers
Necessary voodoo

And the beast
With many heads
And arms rolling
Steamroller

We are the earth intruders
We are the earth intruders
Muddy with twigs and branches

Forgive this tribe

We are the earth intruders
We are the earth intruders
Muddy with twigs and branches

We are the earth intruders
Muddy with twigs and branches
We are the earth intruders

We are the earth intruders
Muddy with twigs and branches
Marching

We are the earth intruders
Muddy with twigs and branches
Marching

March
