Oh I, I, I feel like a diamond
But I ain't got no diamonds
No, I don't even like 'em
Oh I, I, I, I don't need attention
If I got your attention
Then, baby, that's perfection

All the cars and the pearls and the gold in the world
No, it ain't for us
All the stars and the lights and the glamorous nights
No, they ain't for us
So high, high, high, we tasted high life
And it ain't for us
No, it ain't for us

Baby, you make me feel goddamn famous
I feel so goddamn famous
You take what you want
Pieces of me, and my soul, and my heart
You make me feel goddamn famous

Oh I, I, I don't stress the money
Nothing's gonna stop me
Yeah, I'll know that you got me
Oh I, I, I don't need nobody
Don't need no one to watch me
'Cause you're my paparazzi

All the cars and the pearls and the gold in the world
No, it ain't for us
All the stars and the lights and the glamorous nights
No, they ain't for us
So high, high, high, we tasted high life
And it ain't for us
No, it ain't for us

Baby, you make me feel goddamn famous
I feel so goddamn famous
You take what you want
Pieces of me, and my soul, and my heart
You make me feel goddamn famous

Won't let go of ya
I'm at home with ya
No one could ever buy our love in paradise
I won't let go of ya
I'm at home with ya
No one could ever buy our love in paradise

Baby, you make me feel goddamn famous
I feel so goddamn famous
You take what you want
Pieces of me, and my soul, and my heart
You make me feel goddamn famous

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Baby, you make me feel goddamn famous
