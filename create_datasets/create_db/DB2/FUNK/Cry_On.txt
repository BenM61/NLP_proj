All my tears
Are in vain
I just lost, lost
Lost my man
But in spite of all
The wrong he's done
I just cry on
I just cry on

But I still love him
With all my heart
Never, never, never, baby
Did I want to part
But in spite of all the wrong he's done
I just cry on
I just cry on

But maybe one day
Before long
You might decide
To come back home
But until then
I have no relief
You got me living on lonely street

All of my tears
Are in vain
I just lost, lost
Lost my man
But in spite of all the wrong he's done
I just cry on
I just cry on
Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry
I just cry, ah, ah
Cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry
