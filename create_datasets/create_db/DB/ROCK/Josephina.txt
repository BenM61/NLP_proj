Jo, Jo, Jo, Jo, Jo
Josephina
Oh, dream girl
Where did you go

I woke up calling your name
You were gone
Josephina
You're not of this world

What did you bring for me
What will I pay
Can't you hear me
Why can't you hear me

I call your name, I say
Jo, Jo, Jo, Jo,
Josephina
Golden bird

Bird of prey
Spread your wings
Across the sun
Seize the day

You're like a diva
So proud and vain
What will you sing for me
What will you pay

It won't be long
It won't be so long now
I will be with you
I will be with you

Somehow my Josephina
Can't you hear me
Why can't you hear me
Feel my pain

Jo, Jo, Jo, Jo
Josephina
My Josephina
