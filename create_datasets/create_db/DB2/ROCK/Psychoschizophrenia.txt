Hey brother, can you spare some time?
It seems I've lost my mind
I'm one strange personality.
Have I gone crazy?
Yeah, Please take me somewhere new.

I don't associate with people, you see,
Maybe that's what's troubling me,
I feel rebellion's overdue,
So chain me up now,
You'll get what's coming to you

Hey, I'm Schizophrenia

Thunderstorms evolving inside of me,
Straight jacket quick and swallow the key,
My sanity lives on the edge
But I'm so happy,
I'm going away,

Hey, I'm Schizophrenia

It's all in your mind, it's all in my mind.
