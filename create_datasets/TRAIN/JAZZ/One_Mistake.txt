One mistake, (one mistake),
Is all I evever made;
I broke your tender heart,
A heart that held a love so true.

One mistake, (one mistake),
And now I've paid, have paid;
Now I'm comin' back to beg forgiveness
From you.

Why did I leave you?
Why did I grieve you?
Why did I yearn to be free?
Since I broke the ties,
I realise
There's no greater love for me!

One mistake, (one mistake),
Is all I evever made;
I broke your tender heart,
A heart that held a love so true.

One mistake, (one mistake),
And now I've paid, have paid;
Now I'm comin' back to beg forgiveness
From you.
