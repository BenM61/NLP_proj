Watch a movie i've seen five times before
Falling asleep with my head
On the emergency door

Food tastes good at fifty thousand feet
Red wine and cognac
Makes me feel complete

Make me feel safe
Keep me in my place
Make me feel safe
Keep me in my place

The snow and ice 
A green hill below
One more place
I would like to go

Make me feel safe
Keep me in my place
Make me feel safe
Keep me in my place

Watch a movie i've seen five times before
Falling asleep with my head
On the emergency door

Make me feel safe
Keep me in my place
Make me feel safe
Keep me in my place

Make me feel safe
Keep me in my place
Make me feel safe
Keep me in my place
