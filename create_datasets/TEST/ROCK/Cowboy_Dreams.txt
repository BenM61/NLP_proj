Cowboy dreams
Cowboy dreams
You give me cowboy dreams

Love's a silver bullet
That blows your world apart
I wanna be remembered as an outlaw
The boy who stole your heart

I wanna be the guy who wears the white hat
Then rides across the plain
I'm gonna be your enigmatic stranger
Honey you are lookin' at your Shane

Cowboy dreams
Cowboy dreams
You give me cowboy dreams

Cowboy dreams
You give me cowboy dreams

If ever you're in trouble
If ever you are down
I'm gonna be the hangin' judge and sheriff
Gonna ride your troubles out of town

You're lookin' at a mountain
You're lookin' at the law
You're lookin at a six gun legend
Fastest on the draw

Cowboy dreams
Cowboy dreams
You give me cowboy dreams

Cowboy dreams
You give me cowboy dreams

Yippi ay yay

I can make you happy
It's easier than it seems
I'm gonna ambush you at sundown
I'm gonna give you cowboys dreams

Cowboy dreams
Yippi ay yay
I'm gonna give you cowboy dreams
Yippi ay oh
I'm gonna give you cowboy dreams

Cowboy dreams
Cowboy dreams
I'm gonna give you cowboy dreams

Yippi ay yay
I'm gonna give you cowboy dreams

Love's a silver bullet
That blows your world apart
I wanna have it written on my tombstone
Here lies the boy who stole your heart
