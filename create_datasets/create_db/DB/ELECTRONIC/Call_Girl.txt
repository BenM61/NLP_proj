You say that I'm your girl 
And you tell me that I'm your little sugar-honey bunch
But I don't feel safe with you 
Cause in your world there's a lot of little sugar-honey bunch

I'm not the type of girl you need (oh no, no no)
My friends keep telling me again, and again, and again

[Chorus]
I'm not your call girl
I'm not your call girl
I'm not your call girl
I'm not your call call girl, in the night

You have to prove yourself
Or I ain't gonna be your little sugar-honey bunch
I hope that you can do it
Cause I really want to be your little sugar-honey bunch

I'm not the type of girl you need (oh no, no no)
My friends keep telling me again, and again, and again

[Chorus: x3]
