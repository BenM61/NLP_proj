You're wandering about for days
An education for your brain
You start to rearrange
But you keep wondering
Who's to blame

It's just a matter of time
Until you find out you're pretending
To be ok (but you're not)
Something tickles the back of your mind
You ain't getting no grip, you slip and you slide
You'd better ease your mind

Ease your mind
Ease your days for your own good
(Hold right there, partner!)
Ease your kind
Ease your ways for your own good
(Hold right there, partner!)

Do do do do do do do...

Can't you see that you are
Jumping through the roof, man?
Are you a fool that you still need instant approval?
(Can't you see that you are
Jumping through the roof, man?
Are you a fool that you still need instant approval?)

Don't you get tired of your own behaviour?
You keep on acting like you're some kind of stranger
(Don't you get tired of your own behaviour?
You'd better ease your mind!)

Ease your mind
Ease your days for your own good
(Hold right there, partner!)
Ease your kind
Ease your ways for your own good
(Hold right there, partner!)

Come back and save me
Lift me up and amaze me
Lately, you are driving me crazy

And ease your mind

Come back and save me
Lift me up and amaze me
Lately, you are driving me crazy

And ease your mind

Come back and save me
Lift me up and amaze me
Lately, you are driving me crazy

Do do do do do do do
