"I need your love" he said
Lying naked in my bed
He said it quiet, like it's a crime
"I need your love" he said

Did you know when you sleep
You look human, you look like me
And Napoleon's gone with the wind
And you admit defeat

When you fade into darkness, the big blue
You'll know who I am, immortelle
You're the king on this fortune but I'll save you
Don't you know what I am, immortelle

Have a smoke, I lie awake
I wanna shake you until you break
To find the crack into your heart
Maybe it's too late

When you fade into darkness, the big blue
You'll know who I am, immortelle
You're the king on this fortune but I'll save you
Don't you know what I am, immortelle

La la la la la la, immortelle
La la la la la la, immortelle
Hmm

When you fade into darkness, the big blue
You'll know who I am, immortelle
You're the king on this fortune but I'll save you
Don't you know what I am, immortelle

You're the king on this fortune, la la la la la la
You don't need to conquer me, immortelle
You're the king on this fortune, la la la la la la
You don't need to conquer me, immortelle
