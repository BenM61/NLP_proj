Ah, look what they've done to the rock 'n' roll clown 
Ah, rock 'n' roll clown, look he's dead on the ground 
Well he used to high fly but he crashed out the sky 
In a Stardust fling, hey rock 'n roll king is down 

Roll on up, won't you come and take a look at me, oh 
Come on, stand in line, just one at a time and see me 
See my painted-on grin as I stand up to sing 
In a stardust fling, hey rock 'n' roll king is down 

But he's the leader of the band 
He is a lonely man 
Don't you wanna take his hand 
Yes you know you can 

Well I used to high fly but I crashed out the sky 
In a Stardust fling, hey rock 'n? roll king is down
In a Stardust fling, hey rock 'n? roll king is down
In a Stardust fling, hey rock 'n? roll king is down
