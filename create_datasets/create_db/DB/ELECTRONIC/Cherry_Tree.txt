We used to meet on Sundays, 
Feet underneath the cherry tree, 
Hidden by leaves and branches, 
We used to kiss so secretly. 

Baptize my fries and capsize into everything, 
I stole your berries, 
Something to do, 
First guise, disguise, contrive, move into everyone, 
Quite literally, 
I want to move into you. 

Disturb your words and return when you're top of the queue, 
I need a repeat, I know you do to, 
Renegotiate the rate now 'cause I'm leveling out, 
I'm in a hurry, 
Wanna move into you
