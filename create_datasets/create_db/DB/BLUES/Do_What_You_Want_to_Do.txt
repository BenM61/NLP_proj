You think you're the only woman
Who can keep me satisfied
You think you're the only woman
Who can always keep me tied

But you don't know, baby
You don't know what I got in store for you
I'm gonna give up ev'rything, baby
You can do what you want to do

I always took the naggin'
The accusation of doin' wrong
But I'm fed up with it, baby
Because my love is not that strong

You don't know, baby
You don't know what's in store for you
I'm gonna give up ev'rything, baby
You can do what you want to do
