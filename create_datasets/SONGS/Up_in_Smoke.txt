Up in smoke, that's where my money goes
In my lungs and sometimes up my nose
When troubled times begin to bother me
I take a toke and all my cares go up in smoke

Up in smoke, donde todos es mi rey
There are no signs, que dice no fumer
So I roll un "Bomber", y me doy, un buen toke-ay
Y despues I choke, y todos mis cares, go up in smoke

Come on let's go get high

Up in smoke, that's where I wanna be
'Cause when I'm high the world below don't bother me
When life begins to be one long and dangerous road
I take a toke and all my cares go up in smoke
I take a toke and all my cares go up in smoke
