Cool, futuristic Montana

Well, have you ever been mixed up
Feel like you're in a stick-up, a hold-up
A robbery in progress?
Well, I have
 
Well, have you ever been faked out
Feel like you're in a stake-out
A cook-out, barbecued chicken?
Well, I have
 
Come on, mama, get on the yo-yo
We're all givin' up down in the arroyo
 
Have you ever been stranded
Feel like you never landed
A bandit, a merchant of Venice?
Well, I have
Well, have you even been tumbled
Feel like you're in a jungle
A jungle, a town in New Jersey?
Well, I have
 
Come on, mama, get on the yo-yo
We're all givin' up down in the arroyo
 
Well have you ever been hungry
Feel like you're gettin' ugly
Ornery, and everybody's greasy?
Well, I have
Well have you ever been zooey
Feel like you're David Bowie
A truly unidentified person?
Well, I have
 
Come on, mama, get on the yo-yo
We're all givin' up down in the arroyo

Something running parallel
What something is, it might be called
Something other than what could be the same thing

In other words, it might be a contigent-pository
If what you are doing at the same time
That you are doing something else
 
Let's take, for example, if you were born on Lake Michigan
