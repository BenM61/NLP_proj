Goin' home tomorrow
Can't stand your evil ways
Goin' home tomorrow
Can't stand your evil ways

When you're around me
I'm full of misery all day

I can't go on
I can't go on this way
I can't go on
I can't go on this way

You don't want my loving
So I'm going away to stay

Don't try to find me
Don't ever call me on the phone
Don't try to find me
Don't ever call me on the phone

I'm better off without you
So won't you leave poor me alone
