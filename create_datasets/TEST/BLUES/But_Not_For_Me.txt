They're writing songs of love, but not for me
A lucky star's above, but not for me
With love to lead the way
I found more clouds are gray
Than any rainy day, could guarantee

I was a fool to fall, and get that way
I should have known the price, I'd have to pay
Although I can't dismiss
The memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me
