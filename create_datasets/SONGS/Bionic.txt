I gots to gets me some love
'Cause it gets me loved
Gots to gets me some hole
Like it gets me holed
I'm your greatest, oh hero
I'm your heroine your absolute zero

Got the wind on my back
Like a good Frank Black
Gots to gets me some speed
Like the lord Lou Reed
I'm your greatest, oh hard on
I'm your heroine your absolute starfuck

I'm bionic you're bionic
I'm bionic you're bionic
I'm bionic you're so much more
There's fire if you want it

I gots to gets me some cool (I'm losing my cool)
Gots to gets me some love (cos it keeps me above)
I'm your greatest, oh hero
I'm your heroine your absolute starfuck

I'm bionic you're bionic
I'm bionic you're bionic
I'm bionic you're so much more
There's fire if you want it

I'm bionic you're bionic
I'm bionic you're bionic
I'm bionic you're so much more
There's fire if you...
