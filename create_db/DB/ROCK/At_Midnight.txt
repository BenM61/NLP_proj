Uh-Uh-Uh
Let me tell you 'bout my girl
Garantied to make your head curl
Doing things that only she can do

Uh-Uh-Uh
She made the world a space
Taking care of public image
She's looking good but the she always run
It's what she want's to do

At midnight
Oh, I'm gonna love you
Oh, at midnight
Oh, I'm gonna make you mine at midnight

Uh-Uh-Uh
Money is every thing to her
Gonna get her diamond vapours
But there's one thing my name just can't buye

Uh-Uh-Uh
Love waits for the rich and on
Sell your soul for the taste of flowers
Still i love you but then i always will
It's what I want to do

At midnight
Oh, i'm gonna love you
Oh, at midnight
Oh, I'm gonna make you mine at midnight

When daylight comes to you
You hide from the world outside
Lover of the darkest night
Midnight is the time to get high

At midnight
Oh, I'm gonna love you
Oh, at midnight
Oh, I'm gonna make you mine at midnight

At midnight
Oh, I'm gonna love you
Oh, at midnight
Oh, I'm gonna make you mine at midnight

At midnight
Oh, I'm gonna love you
Oh, at midnight
Oh, I'm gonna make you mine at midnight
