In the city made of stone
I hear the sirens moan
I can't escape the beating question:
Where do I belong?

The boundary lines lie before me
I cross into the unknown
I try to leave my fears behind me,
Try to carry on

Ev'ry day sing a song of grace
We've come this far by grace
And when you pray to find your place:
Love will lead the way!

In the shadows of the valley
Tears mingle with rain
A shining light will break my darkness
And mercy will remain

Bless the seven souls who raised me
Back in Georgia state
And tell my loved-ones not to worry
But love will conquer hate

Ev'ry day sing a song of grace
We've come this far by grace
And when you pray to find your place:
Love will lead the way!
