We wake from a dream looking through
Different eyes
Some other space and time
Where love survives all the changes

Time takes you and I into another life
Burn in our hearts of fire
A new design, we are changing
Let the spirit of a new world

Keep our love alive
In the spirit of a new world
We're in overdrive
Believe all that we feel

Living a future dream
Open our eyes to see technology
Our direction
Let the spirit of a new world

Keep our love alive
In the spirit of a new world
We're in overdrive
Step into the dance

We step into the dance of life
Ride the rhythm take a chance
We can make the spirit rise
Reach out there's a new world we created

Break out, hear your heart shout
You can make it
