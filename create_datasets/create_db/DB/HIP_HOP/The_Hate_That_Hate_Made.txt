June 6th in the time of 6 o'clock
Hot summer night in the city of hard knocks
Two black brothers took a walk in the South side
Could've been any brother lookin' for a dope ride

Seein' a white girl wasn't in the plan
But the plan had plans of it's own for a brother man
A bad case of the right place at the right time
Makes you just ask, why?

I guess, you suppose you know what a nigga do
To a female that was meant for you
Jealous 'cause your girlfriend screwin' a black man
So you bust caps on an innocent by stand

But I guess, we all look the same
A goddamn shame, you don't know my name
Must-a just been two blacks so the payback
Fit the ID for someone like me

But you see, I don't think like you do
I come much sicker with the retribute
Rollin' twenty-five deep, troop down in a parkin' lot
Ready movin' steady when I bust your spot, huh

You dumb motherfuckers just don't know me
You don't control me, so leave me lonely
Step and be prone to a cap to the dome
I don't quit, I'll start tearin' up shit

This is a Scarface set and no snakes allowed
Keep the pace ready set brothers rollin' out
Packin' a MAC-10, strapped and capped in
Now who's to blame for the hate that hate made?
