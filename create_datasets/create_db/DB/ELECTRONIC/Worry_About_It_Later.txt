Worry about it later
We couldn't resist the risk
Worry about it later
We couldn't resist the risk

(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

I'm always foolish
Stupid and foul
No one to disguise it
No turning back

I will pay, I will pay, I will pay
As much or as little as I have to
To try and confuse you
Because you have to do

Worry about it later
We couldn't resist the risk
Worry about it later
We couldn't resist the risk

(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

Never to return
Because one turn is enough
Two sides of the same coin
But it's the bad-luck stuff

I will pay, I will pay, I will pay
As much or as little as I have to
To try and confuse you
Because you have to do

Worry about it later
We couldn't resist the risk
Worry about it later
We couldn't resist the risk

(Oh)

Risk
Risk
Risk
(Worry about it later)
Oh
(We couldn't resist the risk)
Oh
(Worry about it later)
Oh
(We couldn't resist the risk)
