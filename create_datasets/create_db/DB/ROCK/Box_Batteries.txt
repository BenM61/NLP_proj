We'll get your stepdad's car
Let's take it out to the cliffs
Oh, we could start a fire
And you can pretend
You can pretend to be a witch
Tip money in the ashtray
Oh, it feels like we're rich
We've got box batteries
And the cheapest beer there is
Hey
It's so dark
And that's what we like
We don't go too far
Oh, but we might
We've got

Box batteries
Box batteries
Box batteries

Now I can see the smoke
From the flagstones in the neighborhood
Rising up above your hair
And your hair looks good
We're not so into nature
Oh, but we're deep into the woods
Bring your tapes and disaffection
And the rest is understood
The rest is understood
It's so dark
And that's what we like
We don't go too far
Oh, but we might
Yeah, it's so dark
Tell the other kids we bite
We don't go that far
Oh, but we might
Oh yeah

Box Batteries
Box Batteries
Box Batteries

We've got, oh
Box batteries
Box batteries
Box batteries
