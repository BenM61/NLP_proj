Now while the beat is slow
Here in your arms I sway
Now that the light is low
there's something I want to say

I guess you've known it for a while
That I mean trouble
I only want to see you smile
And I burst this bubble
The hardest thing
Is to let go

When love is real
Like a flower 
Loves a bee
But I know you're meant
To give yourself 
To someone else
Not me

And I could carry on with you
Does that sound crazy?
I think you feel the same way too
And you can't face it
The hardest thing
Is to let go

But it's not defeat
When you set somebody free
And I know you're meant
To be yourself
With someone else
Not me

Can you let go?
Cause that's love that's real
Like a flower loves a bee
And you know you're meant
To give yourself 
To someone else
Not me

Somebody else not me
Meant for somebody else
Not me
