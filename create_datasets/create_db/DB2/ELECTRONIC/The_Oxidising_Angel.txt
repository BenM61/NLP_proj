In this dark and rainy night
He comes out of the shadows
He wants to finish what he began
Thousand years ago

He starts the engine of his machines
He puts her body on a table
He looks into her broken eyes
And he seals it with a kiss

Where am I? What's happening to me?
Everything so cold... everything so dark...
What is this pain I feel? Why does it hurt?
Please no--let me die!

She's a creation made by evil hands
She slept in her grave for thousand years
But in this night of iron tears
He brought her back to life again

He created an angel just for himself
He gave her beauty, he gave her life
But she could not live without a soul
So she fades away again

He's so fascinated
By her pale white skin
He starts to kiss her body
All over again

They belong together
That's what he has in mind
She kills him with a kiss
Forever joined in death...
