What about our love?
What about our love?

You had me waiting, sitting all alone
Do you still love me? Or is the feeling gone
All that's left of broken dreams and promises
And I don't feel it, no, oh what's going on?

What about our love?
Will we be together?
What about our love?
What about our love?
Will it last forever?
What about our love?

You keep me guessing, got me so confuse
Should we be hanging? Don't know what I'm gonna do
It's not the same as it was before
I can't take it, I got to know for sure

What about our love?
Will we be together?
What about our love?

Will it last forever?
What about our love?

I want to know baby, tell me
Will we stay together?
What about our trust?
I gotta know, will it
Will it last forever
Don't wanna give up

Tell me where we went wrong, I got to know
I don't want to waste my time, I've got to have peace of mind
I've given you the best of me, my heart and soul
Give me an answer, or just let me go
