I sway in the place to a slow disco
And a glass for the saints
And a bar for the road

Am I thinking what everybody's thinkin'?
I'm so glad I came, but I can't wait to leave

Slip my hand from your hand
Leave you dancin' with a ghost
Slip my hand from your hand
Leave you dancin' with a ghost

There's blood in my ears
And a fool in the mirror
And the pain of mistakes couldn't get any clearer

Am I thinking what everybody's thinkin'?
I'm so glad I came, but I can't wait to leave

Slip my hand from your hand
Leave you dancin' with a ghost
Slip my hand from your hand
Leave you dancin' with a ghost

(Don't leave me to slow dance to death)
(Don't leave me to slow dance to death)
(Don't leave me to slow dance to death)
(Don't leave me to slow dance to death)
(Don't leave me to slow dance to death)
(Don't leave me to slow dance to death)
