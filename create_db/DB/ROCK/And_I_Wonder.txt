You used to love me and you used to breathe my name
Now you don't love me and I think the sun's to blame
You found a rich man and he's got an fancy yacht

And I wonder, yes, I wonder
I wonder do you need me

I know I'm a poor man but I should be given a chance
I used to hold you close down at the Palais de Dance
But now I'm crying and you don't even care

And I wonder, yes, I wonder
I wonder do you need me

I'm a loving wreck and I'm waiting waiting time
Just to wait for a letter, waiting for a line
I'm struck here, baby, down by the Serpentine

And I wonder, yes, I wonder
I wonder do you need me

London's a dreary place when there ain't no place to go
People just seat around and they don't talk to me no more
I'ma lonely, ragged and sad and blue

And I wonder, yes, I wonder
I wonder do you need me
