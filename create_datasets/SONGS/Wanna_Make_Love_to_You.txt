How can I explain
This feeling that's true?
Honey, I can't hardly stand it,
I want to make love to you.

I ain't gonna try to tell you
How it's made me so blue,
Sitting alone here and wondering.
I want to make love to you.

When the stars fall from the heavens
And the rivers, they stop their flow,
If you just stop and talk to me,
Honey, that's when I'll know.

I want to make love to you.
I want to make love to you.
I want to make love to you.
I want to make love to you.

Please, stop and tell me,
Tell me you want me too.
Come on, baby,
I want to make love to you.


Oh, darling.
