The sun is high and I'm surrounded by sand
For as far as my eyes can see 
I'm strapped into a rockin' chair 
With a blanket over my knees 
'I' am a stranger to myself 
And nobody knows I'm here 
When I looked into my eyes 
It wasn't myself I'd seen 
But who I've tried to be
I'm thinking of things I'd hoped to forget.
I'm choking to death in a sun that never sets.
I clogged up my mind with perpetual greed
And turned all of my friends into enemies.
And now the past has returned to haunt me.
I'm scared of god - and scared of hell
And I'm caving in upon myself 
How can anyone know me 
When I don't even know myself
