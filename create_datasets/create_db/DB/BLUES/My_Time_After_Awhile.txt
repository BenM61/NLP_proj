It's your time now baby
Ohh but it's gonna be mine after awhile
I said it's your time right now baby
Lord but it's gonna be mine after awhile
You know you know if things don't change
I'm gonna move on down

She stayed out last night
And do you know she just walked in
The girl is gettin' ready
She's going back out again
I said just wait one minute
Just before you go
She didn't even look at me
She just turned and walked out the door

It's your time, it's your time, it's your time right now
Ohh, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta feelin'
Ohh it's gonna, it's gonna, it's gonna be my time after awhile

I got a look through my window
And guess what I seen
My baby sat with another man
In a long black limousine

I said it's your time, it's your time
Yes you know I, you know I got that feelin' woman
Baby it's gonna be my time after awhile

I just wanna talk to my baby
And here's what I wanna say
Go ahead on and mistreat me
But every every dog got his day wow

Somebody better come here and get me baby
I just want to talk to my baby
