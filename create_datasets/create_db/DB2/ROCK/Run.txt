I wanna watch you undress
I wanna watch you glow
Let your hair down
All around, and cover us both
You come in a waves
We crash and we roll
You surround me, pull me, drown me then swallow me whole

You turn, turn, turn, turning me on
Like a slow fire burn
I know that it's wrong
Still I run, run, run, run right into you
Yeah, I run, run, run, run right into you

Oh oh oh
You pull me in close
And buckle my knees
I shake and I shiver just to feel you breathe
You trace my lines (you trace your lines)
Stirring my soul
Shoot sparks at the heart of the world and I watch it explode
(I watch you yeah I watch you)

You turn, turn, turn, turning me on
Like a slow fire burn
I know that it's wrong
Still I run, run, run, run right into you
Yeah, I run, run, run, run right into you

Oh oh oh
I'm amazing (oh oh oh)
When you're beside me (oh oh oh)
I am so much more 

(Oh oh oh) And I feel your fingers
Pound like thunder (oh oh oh)
And I am so much more
I am so much more

You turn, turn, turn, turning me on
Like a slow fire burn
I know that it's wrong
Still I run, run, run, run right into you

You turn, turn, turn, turning me on
Like a slow fire burn
I know that it's wrong
Still I run, run, run, run right into you
I run, run, run, run right into you
Oh love oh love
If I run, run, run, run right back to you

Turning me on
Like a slow fire burn
