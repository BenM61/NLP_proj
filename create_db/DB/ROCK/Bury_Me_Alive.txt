There's no use in crying
All my tears won't drown my pain
Free me from your sorrow
I can't grieve you again
I watched you let yourself die
And now it's too late to save you this time

You bury me alive
And everybody's gotta breathe
Somehow don't leave me, die
Too consumed by your own emptiness and lies

All I did was love you
Now I hate the nightmare you've become
I can't let you fool me
I won't need you again
I watched you let yourself die
And now it's too late to save you this time

You bury me alive
And everybody's gotta breathe
Somehow don't leave me, die
Too consumed by your own emptiness and lies
And everybody's gotta breathe
Somehow don't leave me, die
Too consumed by your own emptiness and lies

Make me feel this love we used to hold
All I see is black and cold
As I try to pull you down
To the ground, the ground

And everybody's gotta breathe
Somehow don't leave me, die
Too consumed by your own emptiness and lies
(you bury me alive)
And everybody's gotta breathe
Somehow don't leave me, die
Too consumed by your own emptiness and lies
