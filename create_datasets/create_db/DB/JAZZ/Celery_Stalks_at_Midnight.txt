Celery stalks at midnight
Lurking in the moonlight
What's this funny nightmare
All about

Celery stalks at midnight
Mounted on their broomsticks
Gliding through the treetops
In and out

It's like a bad dream
A crazy kind of mad dream
Must have been something that I ate
No doubt.

Celery stalks at midnight
Lurking in the moonlight
What's this very funny nightmare
All about
