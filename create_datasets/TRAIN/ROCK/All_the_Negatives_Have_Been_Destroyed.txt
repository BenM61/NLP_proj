I had a feeling from the start of it
I had a joke on everyone
I had a joke who was in everyone
And if you listen up just once you know
If you want, you can never leave and
If you want, you can let her go
I had a feeling from the start of it you could say so, motherfucker
You could say so, motherfucker
And then I took it all around, I took her back and I said to myself
If you want, you can never leave and
If you want, you can let her go
All the negatives have been destroyed, and they said
All the negatives have been destroyed-oh yeah
I had a feeling from the start of it, 
You could let me go if you wanted to
But I haven't seen that you wanted to
So I took it all around, I took it back and I said to myself
If you want (you want) you can never leave and
If you want (you want) you can let her go
All the negatives have been destroyed, and they said
All the negatives have been destroyed-oh yeah
