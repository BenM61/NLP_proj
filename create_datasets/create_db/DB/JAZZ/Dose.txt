I went to see that La Lola just to tell her what I'd done
The things inside my hands were far away from gone
What happens to a kid La Lola when he grows up brown?
Said, "Sit down and let me tell you if you wanna stick around"

Poured some coffee in a cup made of Mexican clay
"Sit down right in that chair and listen what I say
Richer men, poorer men, dumber men, sure men
Who would ever think that they were all made the same"

I laid down on the sofa and fell asleep just yesterday
And in my sleep a guy in white came up to me to say
"Bet you're wondering why everybody else gets all the breaks
While your mama and your papa and your sister's turning gray"

Made a cup of something hot, some kinda Hindu brew
Listen to me good 'cause this is all I have for you
Doesn't matter who you are, this side or that side of the fence
Or you got a pile of money or you can barely pay the rent

When you die and they take you and they put you in the ground
No matter who or what you are, you'll end up looking brown

You end up looking brown
You end up looking brown
You end up looking brown
You end up looking brown
You end up looking brown
