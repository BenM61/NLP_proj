It takes a fast car lady to lead a double life
It takes a slow star lady if you want to do it twice
You take your backseat rumble
Take your front seat wife
Takes a fast car lady to lead a double life

It takes a light foot lady to lead a double life
It takes a good book maybe if you want to do it nice
When you idle at the stop light you better get the signal right
Light foot lady, you need a double life

Well, lift me from the wonder maze
Alienation is the craze
And it's all gonna happen to you
You think it's a phase
And it's all gonna happen to you
When you drive in the haze

It takes a freeway lady to lead a double life
It takes some leeway lady if you want to do it twice
Neon blinking on the street
Everyone is bittersweet
Freeway lady, you lead a double life

Well, lift me from the wonder maze
Alienation is the craze
And it's all gonna happen to you
You think it's a phase
And it's all gonna happen to you
When you drive in the haze
It's all gonna happen to you
(It's all gonna happen to you)
That's right I said
And it's all gonna happen to you
That's right well
Gonna? say it to you
(It's all gonna happen to you)
Well that's right oh?
It's all gonna happen to you, well
I said it's all gonna happen to you yeah
Gonna tell ya again, I said
(It's all gonna happen to you) well...
