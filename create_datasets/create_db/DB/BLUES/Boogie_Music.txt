Boogie music has a pretty sound,
It might even turn your head around, 
It might turn your head around.
When I heard it on the radio, 
You know I fell out on the floor,  I fell out on the floor

It can lift you up, it won't drag you down
We're talkin' about music, sweet soul music,
Once you get that feelin', I bet you'll never lose it
You can shake your head, and stomp your feet
Yeah you boogie to the music child, it can't be beat,

It will raise the dead child, 
It will make a blind man see
Well, if you listen to the boogie 
You can all be free

Boogie music has a pretty sound,
It might even turn your head around, 
It might turn your head around.
When I heard it on the radio, 
You know I fell out on the floor,  I fell out on the floor
