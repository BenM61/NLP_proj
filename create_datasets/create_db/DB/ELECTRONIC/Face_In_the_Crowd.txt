Don't try to tell me you're the only one
Don't ever me that you're mine
You hear that I've been running around
Now you're asking why

Don't start asking why he's running around
Don't try to find out why
Don't go looking where you shouldn't look
'Cause you won't like what you find

You think that you're the only one
How about you take a look around
(take a look around)
I never had trouble getting girls I don't need
(you're just a face in the crowd)

You're not the one, not the one
And not only that you're not anyone, anyone
You're not anyone
Yeah you're not the one, not the one
You're not anyone at all

Don't try to tell me you're the only one
(not the one)
Don't ever tell me you're the only one
(not the one)

You better hear me say
(you better wise up)
It can never be that way
(you're on the way out)
You better hear me say
It can never be that way

Don't try to tell me you're the only one
You're not anyone at all

You're on your way out

You're not the one, not the one
And not only that you're not anyone, anyone
You're not anyone
(you're on your way out)
Yeah you're not the one, not the one
You're not anyone at all

(You're on your way out)

You're not the one, not the one
And not only that you're not anyone, anyone
You're not anyone
