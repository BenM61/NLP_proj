Lift the scab off the sore
Rub another lump of salt in the wound
Word is out that you're
Gonna get reasonable soon

Guess a man is no man
If he doesn't have the beast inside
Guess a man is no man
If he doesn't have the beast inside

Take the head off my neck
Drop the splinters of glass down the hole
'Cause you're doing your best
To destroy every inch of my soul

Guess a man is no man
If he doesn't have the beast inside
Guess a man is no man
If he doesn't have the beast inside

Take the gun off the wall
Put the lead in my soul
Lift the bones from my skin
Lay them out on the floor

Take the gun off the wall
Put the lead in my soul
Lift the bones from my skin
Lay them out on the floor

Don't count your chicken
Before he crawls out of his shell
'Cause the firing squad waits
And you know this so perfectly well

Guess a man is no man
If he doesn't have the beast inside
Guess a man is no man
If he doesn't have the beast inside

Take the gun off the wall
Put the lead in my soul
Lift the bones from my skin
Lay them out on the floor

Take the gun off the wall
Put the lead in my soul
Lift the bones from my skin
Lay them out on the floor

All of our hopes and our wishes
Our future remains
Could be destroyed by these
Pointless emotional games

Guess a man is no man
If he doesn't have the beast inside
Guess a man is no man
If he doesn't have the beast inside

Take the gun off the wall
Put the lead in my soul
Lift the bones from my skin
Lay them out on the floor

Take the gun off the wall
Put the lead in my soul
Lift the bones from my skin
Lay them out on the floor

Take the gun off the wall
Put the lead in my soul
Lift the bones from my skin
Lay them out on the floor

Take the gun off the wall
Put the lead in my soul
Lift the bones from my skin
Lay them out on the floor

Lay them out on the floor
Lay them out on the floor
Lay them out on the floor
Lay them out on the floor
