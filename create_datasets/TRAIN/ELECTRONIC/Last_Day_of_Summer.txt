You crash out on his side
All is quiet, all is calm
The air thick with stale smoke, your cheap perfume and alcohol
And although you know you need him like a stake through your heart
You think it's worse to stay apart

Cause it's the last day of summer,
And it will hurt you more than most
Cause you're still trying to mine for memories in a ghost
It's the last day of summer
And you know you're not supposed,
But you're still trying to mine for memories in a ghost

You're absence makes no sense, just a constant state of suspense
And although you both know the bubble might burst as soon as you meet
Another false start, rather than to stay apart

Cause it's the last day of summer,
And it will hurt you more than most
Cause you're still trying to mine for memories in a ghost
It's the last day of summer
And you know you're not supposed,
But you're still trying to mine for memories in a ghost
