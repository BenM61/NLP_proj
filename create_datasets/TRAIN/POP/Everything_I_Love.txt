If I were Lord Byron,
I'd write you, sweet siren,
A poem inspiring',
A killer diller ooh
Too bad, I'm no poet,
I happen to know it,
But anyway,
Here's a roundelay,
That I wrote last night about you.

You are to me everything,
My life to be, everything,
When in my sleep you appear,
Fair skies of deep blue appear,
Each time our lips touch again,
I yearn for you, oh, so much again,
You are my favorite star,
My haven in heaven above
You are everything I love
