If it seems that I'm too quiet, that's 'cause I'm missin' her
My mind tells me I have to fight, but I can't help missin' her

You'd better leave me alone, you'd better leave me alone
Until I can think about her without feelin' sorry for myself
You'd better leave me be till I don't need her anymore
I don't wanna see her again until I'm sure I'm over her

But still feeling tired and wanting is not like I thought it would be
Love just cannot end at parting; my world's dropped from under me

You'd better leave me alone, you'd better leave me alone
Until I can think about her without feelin' sorry for myself
You'd better leave me be till I don't need her anymore
I don't wanna see her again until I'm sure I'm over her

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
