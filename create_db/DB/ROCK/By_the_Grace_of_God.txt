HEY GIRL
YOU'LL LAND IT
YOU'VE GOT SUPPLIES
IF THEY DEMAND IT 
YOU'VE GOT THE LOOKS
AND THE GLAMOUR
CUT BY THE CHISEL
AND BEAT BY THE HAMMER

THEY'RE NAIVE
SO THEY'LL BELIEVE IT
THEY WILL ACT LIKE DOGS
WHEN THEY receive IT

THROUGH THE DARKNESS
AND THE HAZE
A STRAIGHT AND NARROW
FALL FROM GRACE

THEY NEED - THEY YEARN
THEY LUST WITH CHEEKS UNTURNED
HANDS SHAKE AND HEADS WILL NOD
THEY GET BY BY THE GRACE OF GOD

HEY BOY
YOU UNDERSTAND
SAY YOUR PRAYERS
OR YOU'LL BE DAMNED

HE'S A WATCHER
AND A VOYER
BYSTANDER
AND DESTROYER

THEY NEED - THEY YEARN
THEY LUST WITH CHEEKS UNTURNED
HANDS SHAKE AND HEADS WILL NOD
THEY GET BY BY THE GRACE OF GOD
