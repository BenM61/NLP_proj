city sky comes down like rain
through all the alleys to the sea
i hear footsteps getting louder
drowning in my sleep
painted lies on painted lips
that promise heaven tastes like this
i don't believe that i believed in you
all that money wants

all that money wants
all that money wants

sunday's child will fall through faith
i feel i'm falling out of grace
grey city sky comes down like rain
to drown me in my sleep
people fade and i forget you
i hear footsteps see their faces
but it all means nothing to me now

all that money wants
all that money wants
all that money wants

city sky comes down like rain 
through all the alleys to the sea
i hear her footsteps getting louder
i'm drowning in my sleep
painted lies on broken lips
that promise heaven tastes like this
came home pushed and full of pins

sunday's child will fall through faith
i feel i'm falling out of grace
i see the sky comes down like rain
to drown me in my sleep
people fade and i forget you
i hear footsteps icy faces
but it all means nothing to me 
all that money wants

all that money wants
all that money wants
all that money wants
