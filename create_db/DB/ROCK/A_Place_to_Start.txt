I found a reason to live long ago.
I'm still looking for a place to start.
The only thing I can give to you
are the bits of this broken heart.
I'll always be on the mend.
That'll always be a part of what we are.
I'll always be needing you
much more so when we're apart.

If loner start to change for the worse,
show me something real.
I'll do my best to turn it around and get back to you.

In every blossoming darkness
I'll try to let you lead the way.
With every effort of my body
In every word that I don't say.
Let me not miss an invitation
In any moment of every day.

If lever start to change for the worse,
show me something real.
I'll do my best to turn it around and get back to you.
