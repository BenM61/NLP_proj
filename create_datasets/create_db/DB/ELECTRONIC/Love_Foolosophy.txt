Baby baby, I feel these sweet sensations
Honey honey, looks like a superstar
She's got a promise of lovestruck fascination

What am I to do? How am I to know?
Who you are

She shimmers like a California sunset
Honey, honey glitters but there's no gold
She carries sweetly infectious magic formulas
I'm so delirious, is she that serious?
Is she bringing me on, I've been waiting so long

And this love, fool, osophy is killing 
Previous illusions that
I had in my mind about you
Seems so true, all the lies you're telling
Tragically compelling and
My love it means nothing to you
So maybe I'm still a love fool

I don't want to be a love fool
I don't want the world I want you
