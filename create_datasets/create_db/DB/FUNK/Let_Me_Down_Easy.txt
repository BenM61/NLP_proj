Let me down easy though your love for me is gone
Let me down so easy, baby, since you feel to stay isnt wrong
But its all over but the last goodbye, let me down easy, hmm

When you pass me by, say hello once in a while
When you pass me by, does it hurt so much to smile
But its all over but the last goodbye, let me down easy, baby

I remember at the start
It was so nice to think that we never had to part
But its all over but the last goodbye, let me down easy, baby

Hum hum hum hum,let me down so easy baby, let me down so easy baby
Let me down down down down, let me down so easy baby,oh oh oh
I dont want anyone of your love, baby, let me down down, let me down so easy
Baby, oh oh, let me down so easy
