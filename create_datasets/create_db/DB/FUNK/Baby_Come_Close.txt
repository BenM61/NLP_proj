Turn the lights down low, baby come close 
Put your hand in mine, oh please be kind 
Let me touch your heart, let the fire start 
Oh so warm, so warm 

Soft music plays, please sit down & stay 
Put your trust in me, let this love be 
This is for real, let time stand still 
Oh so warm, so warm 

Turn the lights down low, baby come close 
Oh so warm, so warm 
So warm, so warm 

Oh turn the lights down low, baby come close 
Let dreams come true for me & you 
We won't regret, we won't forget 

Oh so warm, so warm, yeah yeah 
So warm, so warm 
so warm 
Turn the lights down low, baby come close

[Repeats till fade]
Oh so warm
