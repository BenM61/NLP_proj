I was broken, battered, bruised all over
But I was never one to cry
Shattered, torn apart, forsaken
Felt more that than alive

Embraced the pain, buried the hatchet
Learned to sleep with an opened eye
They can waste me, hate me, refuse to save me
But I'm not letting go

For I know
You have to be a light to yourself
Be a spark
In the dark
Shine and be a light to yourself
Watch me glow

I was madly in love with the devil
On those lonely winter nights
I would kiss their lips of an angel

No, I'm not letting go

For I know
You have to be a light to yourself
Be a spark
In the dark
Shine and be a light to yourself
Watch me glow

Watch me glow

No, I'm not letting go
For I know
You have to be a light to yourself
Be a spark
In the dark
Shine and be a light to yourself
Watch me glow

You have to a light to yourself
Watch me glow
Shine and be a light to yourself
Watch me glow

Watch me glow
Shine and be a light to yourself
