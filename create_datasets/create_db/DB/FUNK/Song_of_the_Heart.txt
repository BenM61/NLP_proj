We have to find our heart songs all by ourself
It's the voice you hear inside
Who you truly are (truly are)

Raise your voices brothers and sisters
Praise the great one who put songs in our hearts

You might make a different song, yes that's right it's true
That don't make anybody more or less as good as you
If you can't feel the music that's all you really need
Then turn this party all the way out
Good time guaranteed

Everybody get up
Clap your hands and dance to the beat
Whatever you do little darlin' it's cool
Just get up out your seat
And wave a flag because everybody plays a part
One world united singing the song of the heart

Everybody makes mistakes
Oh yeah, not one or two (right!)
But that don't make the dirty little things they say about you true
(You tell 'em!)
Step aside little babies and watch me do my thing
I don't even need a good reason to do
Listen to me sing

Everybody get up (ha!)
Clap your hands and show them what you got
Tonight we gonna jam from now until eternity
Don't you stop - make it hot oh!
And wave a flag because everybody plays a part
One world united singing this song - this song of the heart

Come on! Watch me now!

Oh, I don't care what the people say
This is my life (this is my life)
I just got to like that OK (OK?)
They can go fly their momma's kite
Hooray! (we got it!)

We can be together if we all do our part
I'll let you if you let me sing the song of the heart

We can be together if we all do our part
I'll let you if you let me sing the song

Song of the heart

All right I'm going to tell you one more time
Listen...
Uh

One world
One world
One world united
Singing a song
Singing a song
Singing a song of the heart

Feel me? Oh yeah!
Feel me? Keep singing!
You can do you
I do me
Whatever! Better get going y'all
The song of the heart
