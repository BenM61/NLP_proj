Didn't I tell you the way back home 
Didn't I warn you to stay on the road 
Didn't I help you to understand 
That life is just time passing thru your hands 

There's no easy path thru it 
The truth is there is no truth to it 
Moving thru the spotlight 
Don't let the paparazzi world define you 
Now you've made your mark on it 
I know you believed the hope of it 
You know nobody wins 
It's the way you lose that keeps it hopeful 

Didn't I tell you I will be there 
Didn't I show you 
I really care 

You spoke of your plans for it 
You talked all about your destiny 
I could see the rain clouds 
But I couldn't stop the rain from falling 
You tried to go way beyond it 
You'd already made the most of it 
Nothing wrong with dreaming 
Just don't fool yourself about the meaning 

Didn't I tell you the way back home 
Didn't I warn you to stay on the road 
Didn't I help you to understand 
That life is just time passing thru your plans 

You say that you can't let go of it 
That your life only works because of it 
You're afraid that you can't hold on to it 
But your heart doesn't seem so sold on it 
Why not try to believe the heart of it 
Why not try to perceive the art in it 
Why not let me be more a part of it 
Didn't I tell you that I'd be there 
Didn't I show you that I really care 

Didn't I tell you the way back home 
Didn't I warn you to stay on the road 
Didn't I help you to understand 
That life is just time passing thru your hands
