We met in the winter
And we fell in love

Right by a fire place
We shared our first embrace
And then inside my heart
I felt a fire start
It's gonna snow outside
The weather will be cold
But I'm gonna be warm (ho ho) this winter

Each time your lips touch mine
They taste like sparkling wine
I feel so warm and loved
Just 'cause I love you so
It's cozy in your arms
I'm yours to have and to hold
But I'm gonna be warm (ho ho) this winter

Ice skating on a frozen lake
Sleigh riding down a mountain slide
Roasting popcorn, dancing 'til the dawn
That was how, a new love was born

It's just like make believe
Each night is New year's eve
Each day is Christmas day
You make me feel this way
It's gonna snow outside
The weather will be cold
But I'm gonna be warm (ho ho) this winter

You know it's gonna snow outside
The weather will be cold
But I'm gonna be warm (ho ho) this winter

Oh, you'll make me warm this winter
Hm baby make me warm (ho ho) this winter

Oh, you'll make me warm this winter
Hm baby make me warm (ho ho) this winter
