I don't want to talk about it 
I've done enough I think 
I don't want to spend more money 
Don't want another drink 
I would scratch out all the images 
If I had the chance 
Don't ask me what I'm thinking 
Can't you see I only want to dance

Dance without sleeping 
Dance without fear 
Dance without senses no message I hear 
Dance without sleeping 
Dance till I'm numb 
Dance till I think I can overcome

Walking on the edge of rage and understanding 
Between the black and the white 
This child is so angry 
Alone here tonight 
Alarming desperation 
Leads me to believe 
With all my shields and protection 
It's only me I deceive

Dance without sleeping 
Dance without fear 
Dance without senses no message I hear 
Dance without sleeping 
Dance till I'm numb 
Dance till I think I can overcome

The eyes on a magazine 
The voice on the radio 
The kiss on the movie screen 
This is the story I know 
Fathers hold on and they never go 
Mothers hold on and they never go 
Lovers hold on and they never go 
Lovers they come and they never go

Dance without sleeping 
Dance without fear 
Dance without senses no message I hear 
Dance without sleeping 
Dance till I'm numb 
Dance till I think I can overcome
