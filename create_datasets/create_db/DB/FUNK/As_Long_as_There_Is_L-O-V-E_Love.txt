You've told me lots times there's another on your mind
And you say that you find it's so hard to forget him
No matter how I try, I still envy the guy
Even though I'm sure that I never even met him

But I've been lovin' you so long
And my love's been true, so long, don't you know
As long as there is L-O-V-E love
And T-I-M-E, time, it's for sure that I'm

I'm gonna keep on trying
(I'm gonna keep on trying)
I'm gonna keep on trying
(I'm gonna keep on trying)
Every day, yeah
(I'm gonna keep on trying)
Yeah

They say patience is a virtue, so I will not desert you
I realize he hurt you so it's gonna take some time, now
For you to forget about him and learn to live without him
Don't doubt me 'cause you doubt him
'Cause we could make some time now

And I'll be trying hard for you
I need you, baby, yes, I do, don't you know
As long as there is L-O-V-E, love
And T-I-M-E, time, it's for sure that I'm

I'm gonna keep on trying
(I'm gonna keep on trying)
I'm gonna keep on trying, baby
(I'm gonna keep on trying)
Every day, yeah
(I'm gonna keep on trying)
Hear what I say, yeah
(I'm gonna keep on trying)
