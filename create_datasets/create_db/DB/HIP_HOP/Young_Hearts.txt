You left me here alone with a shine 
Our hearts were strong but I couldn't find 
My world alone how could I break my home 
Still I doubted you and still your strength 
Enchanted me you was the father to my child 
And a man to me now I'm sung of strong hearts 
Run free run free young hearts 
Young hearts run free 
Run free young hearts 

(Cappadonna) 
Girlfriend, what you did was wrong 
Even though the love was strong, you moved on 
Never had faith in the Don, you was safe 
With the Don, and then you walked out 
A broken house, a broken heart 
Cry for my dart, we had a plan 
We was woman and man, the hourglass 
Held the sand, I held you like contraband 
But you didn't understand when the four devils 
Came inside of your life that night 
We argued and fight, you knew it wasn't right 
Fucked up our life, my thoughts come stronger 
Every ounce, it's not my fault 
That you wanted to bounce, now you tellin' me 
That you cleaned up your act, beep me every time 
But I never call back, that's how I felt 
When you was makin' me crack 
Me leave wifey for you?? 
I'm crying 
I'm crying 

You left me here alone with a shine 
Our hearts were strong but I couldn't find 
My world alone how could I break my home 
Still I doubted you and still your strength 
Enchanted me you was the father to my child 
And a man to me now I'm sung of strong hearts 
Run free run free young hearts 
Young hearts run free 
Run free young hearts 

(Blue Raspberry) 
Young hearts, run free 
Run free, young hearts 
Young hearts, run free
