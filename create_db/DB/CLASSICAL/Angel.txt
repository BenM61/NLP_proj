I, I can't read the future
But I still want to hold you close
Right now, is all I want from you
So give me the morning
Sharing another day
With you, is all I want to know

And baby I, I've tried to forget you
But the light of your eyes still shine
You shine like an angel
A spirit that won't let me go

I, I didn't want to tell you
Things I didn't want to know myself
I was afraid to show
But you gave me a reason
A reason to face the truth
To face the truth, face the truth, face the truth

And baby I, I've tried to forget you
But the light of your eyes still shine
You shine like an angel
A spirit that won't let me go
Won't let me go
Let go of my heart
