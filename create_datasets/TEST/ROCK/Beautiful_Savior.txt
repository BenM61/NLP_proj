You are mine and I am yours, My Love
Nothing could keep me from your side, My Love
I look Into the ocean, I see you, 
I look into the heavens, I see you, 
And your love is flowing like a fountain 
It pours on me

Beautiful savior 
I'll be forever by your side 
Hear the sounds of heavens song
Listen as the people sing along
I look into the ocean, I see you
I look into the heavens, I see you 
And you love is flowing like a fountain 
It pours on me
