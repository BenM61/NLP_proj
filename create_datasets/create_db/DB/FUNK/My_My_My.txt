So good
My, My, My
Listen
Put on your red dress

And slip on your high heels
And some of that sweet perfume
It sure smells good on you
Slide on your lipstick

Let your hair down
'Cause Baby when you get through
I'm going to show you
Tonight will be a special night

No matter where we go
And I'm so proud to be with you
I just want to let you know

You got my saying
My, My, My
My, My, My
You sure look good tonight

And your so damn fine
I gotta say
My, My, My
My, My, My
You sure look good tonight

After all this time
Slip on your nightgown
Step into our bedroom
First I want to take sometime

I just want to look at you
Girl you are so fine
I can't believe you're mine
And all I want to do

I want to make love to you
Tonight will be a special night
A minute more to come
And I'm so proud to be with you
So proud to share you're love

My, My, My
My, My, My
My, My, My
My, My, My

Make love all night long
Make love all night long
'Til the dawn
Come on
Come on
Sweet little thing I need you

And I'm so proud to be with you
So proud to share you're love
My, My, My
My, My, My
You sure look good tonight

I want to love you in everyway
I want to love you in everyway
Let me
Let me

Show you how sweet it's gonna be
I want to show you things that you
Never, ever, ever seen before

Put your nightgown on
Let your hair hang low
Step into our room
I'm in the mood to love you all night long

My, My, My
My, My, My
My, My, My
My, My, My

My, My, My
My, My, My
My, My, My
My, My, My

My, My, My
My, My, My
My, My, My
My, My, My
