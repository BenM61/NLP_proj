I wanna be your afternoon
When you take a break from work
When you go to see your debutante in the city
Man, I wanna know that I saw you first

I wanna be your afternoon
I wanna be your good time girl
I wanna be your all day too
But if I had to choose I'll be your afternoon

She can have your money, Joe
She can take you out for lunch
She can tuck you in at night
And you can tell her all about what's goin' on

I wanna be your afternoon
Come on boy, we'll have some fun
I wanna be your all night too
But if I had to choose I'll be your afternoon

I wanna be your afternoon
I want you comin' back for more
When you go to see your debutante in the city
Man, I want you wonderin' what for

I wanna be your afternoon
I'm gonna jump, now don't let go
I wanna be your whole life too
But if I have to choose I'll be your afternoon
