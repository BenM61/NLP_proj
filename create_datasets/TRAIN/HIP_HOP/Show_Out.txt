I got lots of gwalla, lemme show you how I show out.
Everywhere I go I,
Dress up and I go out.
I got lots of gwalla, lemme show you how I show out .

(Show out) Gucci, Louie, Prada, man I'm all about my dollas
(Show out) I be all up in the mall ballin like it's no tomorrow
(Show out) Gucci, Louie, Prada, man I'm all about my dollas
(Show out) I be all up in the mall ballin like it's no tomorrow (out out out out)

I got lots of gwalla, I spend it.
I'm a ball-a-hollic like my money, never ending.
Pockets so swole just like Popeye on his spinach.
Like Roscoe why you *grind* so hard? I'm like I'm tryna get it.
And that's just how I do it, hit the mall with bout 10 stacks; but you know that I blew it.
Hit the blunt, and threw it. That's just how we do it.
V.I.P. with M.M.I. you know we gon be stupid.
You know I make it rain hoe, Goosey by the bottle, blowin fruity like a mango.
Gone and catch this change hoe, yeah we in this thang hoe.
It's R-O-S-C-O-E dash, I'm headed for the fame hoe.

Everywhere I go I
Dress up and I go out,
I got lots of gwalla, let me show you how I show out
Everywhere I go I,
Dress up and I go out,
I got lots of gwalla, let me show you how I show out

(Show out) Gucci, Louie, Prada, man I'm all about my dollas
(Show out) I be all up in the mall ballin like it's no tomorrow
(Show out) Gucci, Louie, Prada, man I'm all about my dollas
(Show out) I be all up in the mall ballin like it's no tomorrow (out out out out)

Show out, show out, show out, all I do is show out.
Inhale the kushhh, then I blow out.
SS Camero bitch, watch me as I go out
Back to the crib with yo girl and I go out.

We don't even go out, all she do is hoe out.
I don't even know her and I fucked er, what you know bout that?
See all she know is Roscoe got dem racks
Now my meat's between her buns like a fuckin big mac.
And everytime she place her order, I beat er then deport er.
I get heads and tails like both sides of the quarter.
Shawty bad, she expensive; so you prolly couldn't afford er.
But every time I see her it's crunch time, like we in the fourth quarter, and I'm gone.

Everywhere I go I,
Dress up and I go out,
I got lots of gwalla, let me show you how I show out
Everywhere I go I,
Dress up and I go out,
I got lots of gwalla, let me show you how I show out .

(Show out) Gucci, Louie, Prada, man I'm all about my dollas
(Show out) I be all up in the mall ballin like it's no tomorrow
(Show out) Gucci, Louie, Prada, man I'm all about my dollas
(Show out) I be all up in the mall ballin like it's no tomorrow (out out out out)
