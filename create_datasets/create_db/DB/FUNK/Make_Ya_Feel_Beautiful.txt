Baby, first off let me start by saying
I ain't trying to get in your jeans
First, I'd rather learn your ups and downs
And everything in between

I wanna know you, your insecurities
Secrets and your needs
I want your mental and your physical too
And once I've got it I won't stop
Until you know you're beautiful

[Chorus]
I just wanna make you feel beautiful
Wanna make you feel beautiful
Girl, that's all I wanna do
Girl, just let me make you feel beautiful
Let me make you feel beautiful
'Cause you are beautiful
I just wanna make you feel beautiful
Wanna make you feel beautiful
Girl, that's all I wanna do
Girl, just let me make you feel beautiful
Let me make you feel beautiful
'Cause you are beautiful

Beautiful as Sunday in the spring
Saturday in the fall, beautiful as poetry
Oh, when you look at me
Say nothing at all

I want you to know this
Girl, I want you to see that it's real
I want you to feel that you're my focus
And, girl, that's what you'll be
Until I make you see that you are beautiful

[Chorus]

There's so much for ya, girl
I know that you're beautiful from your head to your toe
You are so beautiful; there's so much for ya, girl
I know that you're beautiful from your head to your toe
You are so beautiful

[Chorus]
