What's a man supposed to do
When the blues have got him down
What's he gonna do
When the blues have got him down
You go down to the liquor store
And you drink your bottle down

Where you gonna run to
Or are you gonna hide
Where you gonna run to
With those blues right down inside
You got no place left to go
You go down to the liquor store
And you drink your bottle down

Where you gonna run to
Are you gonna hide
Where you gonna run to
With those blues right down inside
You got no place left to go
You go down to the liquor store
And you drink your bottle down.
