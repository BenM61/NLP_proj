Underrated, overrated up and down in here
I always thought I was the one who got to run the bill
Now I can't seem to get it off of my mind
Losing my grip because I think about it all the time

Making up the stories is the type of thing that you do
Outrageous, simply outrageous
Forget about your merits or the methods that you're used to
Outrageous, simply outrageous

Mixing up the potions like a medicine man
Stirring my emotions cause I know when you know you can
Leave me open, halfway maybe I can heal myself
You just seem to keeping on, keep it up

Keep on keeping on
You just keep on, you just keep on
Keep on keeping on
You just keep on, you just keep on
Keep on keeping on
You just keep on, you just keep on

I must admit that I've been up and down just like a yo-yo
Roller coaster of love, didn't know where the heck did I go
Feels like you're under my skin
Man said love, couldn't remember how it all began

Making up the stories is the type of thing that you do
Outrageous, simply outrageous
Forget about your merits or the methods that you're used to 
Contagious, simply outrageous

Mixing up the potions like a medicine man
Stirring my emotions cause I know with your love you can
Baby, open halfway maybe I can heal myself
Keep on, keep it up

Forget about it, forget about it, the medicine you're used to
Mixing up the potions, that's your miracle baby
Stirring my emotions cause I know that you know you can
Leave me hoping, halfway baby I can heal myself

You just keep on, doing what you do
Keep on, keeping on
You just keep on, doing what you do
Keep on, keeping on

I'm onto your plan Mr. Medicine Man
I'm onto your plan Mr. Medicine Man
I'm onto your plan Mr. Medicine Man
I'm onto your plan Mr. Medicine Man
I'm onto your plan Mr. Medicine Man
I'm onto your plan Mr. Medicine Man
