All the things you hate I find fun
Things you wanna see are just done
I may regret if you're the right one
But I can't avoid the midnight run

I'll keep on going, I'll keep on going
Til I find the right one
I'll keep on growing, I'll keep on growing
Til I find myself a new gun

If we're meant to be together change the way you see the weather
Live for now, forget forever
We can still be in December
If we're meant to be together change the way you see the weather
Live for now, forget forever

On another midnight run, sniffin for trouble, unlucky for some
On another midnight run, I'll still be breathing come the morning sun
It's hurting my eyes, it's hurting my ears
I know, I know, I'm know there'll be tears
You're hurting inside, been hurting for years
I know, I know, I know there'll be tears
But it's never that clear, clear

All the things you said you don't like,
Were helping me get high as a kite
Someone promised me they wouldn't bite
I guess I'm someone different at night

I'll keep on going, I'll keep on going
Til I my heart says no
I'll keep on growing, I'll keep on growing
Til I find myself a new show

If we're meant to be together change the way you see the weather
Live for now, forget forever
We can still be in December
If we're meant to be together change the way you see the weather
Live for now, forget forever

On another midnight run, sniffin for trouble, unlucky for some
On another midnight run, I'll still be breathing come the morning sun
It's hurting my eyes, it's hurting my ears
I know, I know, I'm know there'll be tears
You're hurting inside, been hurting for years
I know, I know, I know there'll be tears
But it's never that clear, clear

[Rap:]
Got a couple of skeletons in my closet
Couple of skeletons in my bed
Couple of skeletons in my wallet
Couple of skeletons in my head
I never shoulda listened to the serpent
No one's perfect certainly it worked for me
You've tasted sherbert so don't point your sticks at me

I've read the ten commandments at large no harm ignoring parts of it
I've had it up to here with the jargon
Pardon? They're my rules I started
Not saying that I don't feel guilty
Silky smooth it's never gonna be
But I'm looking at a man in the mirror right now and I'm not quite sure it's me

On another midnight run, sniffin for trouble, unlucky for some
On another midnight run, I'll still be breathing come the morning sun
It's hurting my eyes, it's hurting my ears
I know, I know, I'm know there'll be tears
You're hurting inside, been hurting for years
I know, I know, I know there'll be tears
But it's never that clear, clear
