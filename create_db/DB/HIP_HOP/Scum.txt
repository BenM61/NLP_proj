Kids hopping gates in public park gangs
Tryna express themselves with no real plans
Segways in alleyways, suffering in my own mind
S-C-U-M, the used and abused
Cold comes in through your smashed windows
Leaving damp on the walls next to your pillows
Never had much but you appreciate things better
Ripping roaches out of the eviction letter

S-C-U-M
Stealing cars under masks
S-C-U-M
Scummy cunts are using me
S-C-U-M
Stealing cars under masks
S-C-U-M
Scum

Well, there's fear when you drive off with a tear
Leaving gravel scattered near
Like you might disappear
Leaving things left unclear
I wish you'd really hear me out
Instead of storming about
Grabbing keys
Baby, please don't leave

S-C-U-M
Stealing cars under masks
S-C-U-M
Scummy cunts are using me
S-C-U-M
Stealing cars under masks
S-C-U-M
Scummy cunts are using me again

We always say the most hurtful things
But never, never know why
And I'm not sure that it's true, but
It can't be no lie
You want the last word
And so do I

S-C-U-M
Stealing cars under masks
S-C-U-M
Scummy cunts are using me
S-C-U-M
Stealing cars under masks
S-C-U-M
Scummy cunts are using me again

Dange
Dange

S-C-U-M
Stealing cars under masks
S-C-U-M
Scummy cunts are using me
S-C-U-M
Stealing cars under masks
S-C-U-M
Scummy cunts are using me again
