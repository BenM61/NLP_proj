Love is bringing me down
Love is bringing me down
That's why I'm always crying

You know you stayed away too long
You know you stayed away too long
It wasn't right, 'cause you know right from wrong

I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't why you always wants to make me cry
I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't why you always wants to make me cry
But darling I need you by my side!
