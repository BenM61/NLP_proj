Oh yea oh yea
(it's you're turn now kid)
Bad boy

[Chorus]
I want a woman that's down for me
I want a woman that'll take care of my body 

[Loon]
I want a woman that'll wash my hair
Someone who's always there

I want a woman that'll show me things
Someone to fullfil my dreams
Settle down wit be my queen
she's the only one for me

Yo ebony complexion, came in my direction 
Eyes made connection, body was perfection 
And got a smile that will light you're life up 
She make a thug put the guns and knives up 
Defenitly the type of chick you wife up
Tennis skirts and nike up, throwin the bike up 
1100 ducatti, ain't as fine as her body
don't believe me, should have been at the party
you can tell wheter not was her hobby 
The way niggas act, you would think j.lo in the lobby
Or, maybe beyonce maybe ashanti
The way i feel ma i need a fiance
The type of love that will last foreva
Not a chick that's around just for half my cheddar
want to play want to laugh together
Even flash together, and girl you can get the cash wheneva (yeah)

[Chorus]
I want a woman that's down for me (oh yes i do)
I want a woman that'll take care of my body (my body)
I want a woman that'll wash my hair (ohh yea)
Someone who's always there (always there)

I want a woman that'll show me things (ohh yea)
Someone to fullfil my dreams (my dreams) 
Settle down wit be my queen
she's the only one for me

Uh... yeah... uh... yo... yo
When it comes to sex, I'm similar, to the thriller
In manilla, they call me young marcus I'm heartless
But baby girl I'm on a whole notha plateau
After i taste you i'll hit from the back slow
you can get it from the back mo
Until you hit a nigga back whoa
It was a fight tonight, I'm going out like mike tonite
I might bite tonite, you got a right to like
Wateva you want, tonites the night
We gon be right tonite, bottles on ice tonite
Teddy p barry white tonite (keep going)
Cause i adore you, and that's the reason why i spoil you
Foot massage body rub with the oil
I knew i wanted you first minute i saw you
And i was lucky to find a woman that's loyal
(lets go)

[Chorus]
I want a woman that's down for me (oh yes i do)
I want a woman that'll take care of my body (my body)
I want a woman that'll wash my hair (wash my hair)
Someone who's always there (and i'll wash urs to)

I want a woman that'll show me things (show me things) 
Someone to fullfill my dreams (baby baby baby)
Settle down wit be my queen
she's the only one for me

Uh yea come on uh yo ay yo
Ay yo the things that you showed me, the way you consoled me
The way that you used to hold me might have moled me
To the man that you see in the flesh
I promise you, i could neva be like the rest 
Treat you like my moms, as far as the way that i love her
Feelings I'm feel inside like the day that i hugged her
Open up the door, i help her out with the bags
Car get dirty, i help her out the jag
Folks get flirty, i help em out with the mag
I ain't lyin, I'm in love wit you bad
Cause you something i neva had, something i want to lose
Something i gotta have, its nothing for me to choose
But still i hope that i love get perfected
Even thou on the low it get hectic
Feelings we share don't need no correction
Let me be you're angel and i'll be you're protection (mario talk to em)

Girl won't you take my hand (ohh) i'll help you understand (oh baby)
This could be love (oh yea) ohh this feels like love to me

I want a woman that'll wash my hair (wash my hair)
Someone who's always there (oh baby baby)
