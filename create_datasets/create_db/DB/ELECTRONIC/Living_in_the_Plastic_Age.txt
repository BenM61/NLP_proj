Every day my metal friend
Shakes my bed at 6am
Then the shiny serving clones
Run in with my telephones

Talking fast I make a deal
Buy the fake and sell whats real
Whats this pain here in my chest
Maybe I should take a rest

They send the heart police to put you under, Cardiac arrest 
and as they drag you the door 
They tell you that you've failed the test

Living in the
Living in the plastic age
Looking only half my age
Hello doctor lift my face
I wish my skin could stand the pace

In the bed I read my mind
Remember how the mice were blind
I watch them fighting in their cage
Could this be the plastic age?

They send the heart police to put you under Cardiac arrest 
and as they drag you the door 
They tell you that you've failed the test

Living in the 
Plastic age
Plastic age
Plastic age

PLAS-TIC
PLAS-TIC

They send the heart police to put you under Cardiac arrest 
and as they drag you the door 
They tell you that you've failed the test

Living in the

Plastic age
Plastic age
Plastic age
