Oh is he more, too much more than a pretty face 
It's so strange the way he talk, it's a disgrace 
Well I know I've been out of style 
For a short while 
But I don't care how cold you are 
I'm coming home soon 
I'm gonna make you a star, yeah 

Well he say he's into his music 
But I don't believe it 
He just doesn't seem to understand the rock media 
Well I know I'm not super hip 
And I'm liable to take a slip 
But I don't care how cold you are 
I'm coming home soon 
I'm gonna make you a star, yeah, yeah 

We gonna make ya a star 
We gonna make ya a star 

Oh is he more, too much more than a pretty face 
(I don't think so) 
It's so strange the way he talkin', it's a disgrace 
Well I know I've out of style 
For a short while 
But you see I don't care how cold you are 
I'm coming home soon 
I'm gonna make you a star, yeah 

We gonna make ya a star 
We gonna make ya a star 
We gonna make ya a star 
We gonna make ya a star 
We gonna make ya a star
