I, loved you in the sunshine
You chase the moon with a spear
Twenty afternoons in utopia
Kiss an ugly turtle to make it cry
Sever the head of cornucopia
We rape the Earth and don't know why it strikes

Do you believe in stormy weather, stormy weather?
Hurricanes play musical chairs with homes and chateau
The whirling dervish tornadoes we call disaster
Seesaw tsunamis give and take, what's the matter?

I, loved you in the sunshine
You chase the moon with a spear
I pray that you will be all mine
You foam at the mouth and disappear

Sever the head of cornucopia
We f*ck the Earth and don't know why it cries

Do you believe in stormy weather, stormy weather?
Hurricanes play musical chairs with homes and chateau
The whirling dervish tornadoes we call disaster
Seesaw tsunamis give and take, what's the matter?
I, loved you in the sunshine
You chase the moon with a spear
I pray that you will be all mine
You foam at the mouth and disappear

We broke our pact
And away we go
To another place

Oh, o, o, oh

Where we come home
Why do we disfigure all the things that are so beautiful inside?
Where we compose the calamities for all to abide
Microcosm, macrocosm are the same
What a lame game

Don't you think we're extraordinary?
Believing, and seeing
Realizing the imaginary
Don't you, don't you?
Yes, I think we're extraordinary
Being, and living
Yes, I think we ought to marry

We broke our pact
And away we go
To another place

I, loved you in the sunshine
You chase the moon with a spear
I pray that you will be all mine
You foam at the mouth and disappear
