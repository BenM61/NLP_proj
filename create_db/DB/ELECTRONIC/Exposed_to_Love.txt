Changing stages to the love and games 
Silent whispers in the falling rain 
It took your heart to expose me to love 
There's a look, there's a look in your eyes 
And in your smile even just for a while 
In the still, in the still of the night 
I've got to show you baby how I feel 
And melt you with my love 

[Chorus:]
Exposed to love 
Never felt like this love 

[Chorus]

Hear my echos, they are not in vain 
Listen to me before I go insane 
You found a way into my open arms 
Like the stars, like the stars heart to heart 
Is there a way for me to sing you this song 
In the heat, in the heat of the night 
I've got to show you baby how I feel 
And melt you with my love 

[Chorus x2] 

I've got to show you honey how I feel 
And boy I'll melt you with my love 

[Chorus x5]
