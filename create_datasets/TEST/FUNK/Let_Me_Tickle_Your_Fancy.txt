Like the sun, I rise and shine
With last night on my mind
It's so hard to concentrate
Til our love we recreate
Let me tickle your fancy 
Let me excite your soul
Let me tickle your fancy 
Let me excite your soul
When I think about us 
I get all keyed up
And the tantalizing touch
That I love 

Like the sun, I rise and shine
With last night on my mind
It's so hard to concentrate
Til our love we recreate
Let me tickle your fancy 
Let me excite your soul
Let me tickle your fancy 
Let me excite your soul
When I think about us 
I get all keyed up
And the tantalizing touch
That I love 

Honey words cannot express
The sensation that I get 
It's a quiverin', tremblin' feelin',
Make me wiggle
It makes me shake
When I think about us 
I get all keyed up
And the tantalizing touch 
That I love

Like the sun, I rise and shine
With last night on my mind
It's so hard to concentrate
Til our love we recreate
Let me tickle your fancy 
Let me excite your soul
Let me tickle your fancy 
Let me excite your soul
When I think about us 
I get all keyed up
And the tantalizing touch
That I love 

It's gettin' late
And I can't wait 
To relieve that love we made
I got an itchin' in my heart
You control that vital part
(Let me) tantalizing tickle
Keyed up for touch (good God)
C'mon let me tickle your fancy 
Let me excite your soul
