When I was a kid I was best at whatever I did
When I was a kid I was smart, at the top of the class
When I was a lad I was sure I had the world in my hands
I was my own teacher I had my own plan

I could have been an athlete could have trained all the time
Been just like the others could have left them behind
But I was too lazy I could not see ahead
All I thought of was music that was filling my head

I could have been a painter painting life in a rush
All I saw in a day on canvas with my brush
But I was just painting my life in a song
Getting all the chords right getting all the words wrong

I could have been a writer with a back catalogue
Full of stories of crimes, sex and beer, girls and drugs
But instead I was writing my first song so bad
On the cheapest guitar that the music store had

Cause instead I strummed on guitars
Instead I wasted my time
And I strummed on guitars

I could have been a lawyer defending some guy
With a paycheck so big for my heart paid to lie
But instead I was keeping the truth to myself
In the records I placed one by one on my shelf

I could have been a champion, man of the year
Wave to the crowd as they scream and cheer
But here I am playing to people sat down
Nursing their beers while I play the clown

And instead I strummed on guitars
Instead I wasted my time
And I strummed on guitars

I could have been a racing car driver speed mad
Seeking the thrills that my youth never had
But instead I was busy enjoying my age
With teen punk rock anthems and hearts paid to rage

I could have been a scientist, doctor or man
With a stethoscope diagnosing ladies' old hands
But instead I built fret-callous fingertip scars
On my ten year old hands meant for toy ships and cars

And instead I strummed on guitars
Instead I wasted my time
Strummed on guitars

I could have been so much
But I wasted my time on useless guitars
I could have been so much
But I'm not
And I'm glad
And I'm glad
Cause when I was a kid I was best at whatever I did
