I feel so uninspired
All the songs that I write are about you
You're not about me anymore
You're standing on the shore
I'm drifting away, I can't hear you no more
And the further that I get
I'm closer to decisions that I will regret

It's not about you, it's not about you anymore
It's not about you, it's not about you anymore

I feel so uninspired
All the songs that I write are about you
You're not around me anymore
It feels like we capsized
Splitting down the sides, you're not around me
This is our last chance to make it work

It's not about you, it's not about you anymore
It's not about you, it's not about you anymore
It's not about you, it's not about you anymore
It's not about you, it's not about you anymore

Please don't take my hope away
Please don't take my hope away
Please don't take my hope
It's not about you
It's not about you anymore

It's not about you, it's not about you anymore
It's not about you, it's not about you anymore
It's not about you, it's not about you anymore
It's not about you, it's not about you anymore
