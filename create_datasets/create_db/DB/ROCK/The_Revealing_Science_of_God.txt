The Revealing Science of God can 
Be seen as an ever-opening flower in which 
Simple truths emerge examining the complexities 
And magic of the past and how we should not forget 
The song that has been left to us to hear. The
Knowledge of God is a search, constant and clear.

Dawn of light lying between a silence and sold sources,
Chased amid fusions of wonder, in moments hardly seen forgotten
Colored in pastures of chance dancing leaves cast spells of challenge,
Amused but real in thought, we fled from the sea whole.
Dawn of thought transferred through 
Moments of days under searching earth
Revealing corridors of time provoking memories, 
Disjointed but with purpose,
Craving penetrations offer links with the self instructor's sharp
And tender love as we took to the air, a picture of distance.
Dawn of our power we amuse redescending as fast as misused
Expression, as only to teach love as to reveal passion chasing
Late into corners, and we danced from the ocean.
Dawn of love sent within us colours of awakening among the many
Won't to follow, only tunes of a different age, as the links span
Our endless caresses for the freedom of life everlasting.

Talk to the sunlight caller
Soft summer mover distance mine

Called out a tune but I never saw the face
Heard but not replaced
I ventured to talk, but I never lost my place

Cast out a spell rendered for the light of day
Lost in lights array
I ventured to see, as the sound began to play

What happened to this song we once knew so well
Signed promise for moments caught within the spell
I must have waited all my life for this
Moment moment

The future poised with the splendor just begun
The light we were as on
