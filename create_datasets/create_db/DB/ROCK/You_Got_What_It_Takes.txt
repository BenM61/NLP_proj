Ow! You don't drive a big fast car, no
You don't look a-like a movie star
And on your money we won't get far
But baby, you got what it takes, Oh! to satisfy
You got what it takes to set my soul on fire
But oh, oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh whoa-oh-oh yeah
You got what it takes for me

Ow! You don't live in a beautiful place
And you don't dress in the best of taste
Oh! Nature didn't give you such a beautiful face
But baby, you got what it takes, Oh! to satisfy
You got what it takes to set my soul on fire
But oh, oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh whoa-oh-oh yeah
You got what it takes for me

Now when you're near me, ooo-wee
My head goes around and around
And when you kiss me, a-little girl
My love comes tumblin' down, you send me

You don't live in a beautiful place
Oh, you don't dress in the best of taste
And nature didn't give you such a beautiful face
But baby, you got what it takes, Oh! to satisfy
You got what it takes to set my soul on fire
But oh, oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh whoa-oh-oh yeah
You got what it takes for me

Now when you're near me, mmm-mmm
My head goes around and around and around and around
And when you kiss me, a-little girl
My love comes tumblin' down, you send me

You don't live in a beautiful place, no
You don't dress in the best of taste
And nature didn't give you such a beautiful face
But baby, you got what it takes
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you got what it takes
Baby, I'm tellin' you
You got what it takes

Hey! hey! hey!
