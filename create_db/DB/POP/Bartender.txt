It's a little after midnight
There's a couple in the corner
And I wonder what he said because she's crying
And I guess they won't remember
When they wake up in the morning
With the headache from the whiskey and the wine
I know that I have said things I regret when I am sober
'Cause we always hurt the ones we love the most
I messed up and I know it if I hurt you girl I'm sorry
But it's good to see the girl I used to know

We can dance but I can't dance
Maybe we can stick to holding hands
Or should we raise a glass
And forget the past?

If we keep on drinking we're gon' fall back in love
So fill it up, fill it up
We must not be thinking 'cause we can't get enough
So fill it up, fill it up
Bartender, can you pour some love?
Bartender, can you pour some love?

We can talk about a future, we don't wanna reminisce
Because we both know it was me who got it wrong
But f*ck it's good to see you
You look awesome and I miss you
Baby listen now, they're playing our song

We can dance but I can't dance
Maybe we can stick to holding hands
And let's raise a glass
And forget the past

If we keep on drinking we're gon' fall back in love
So fill it up, fill it up
We must not be thinking 'cause we can't get enough
So fill it up, fill it up
Bartender, can you pour some love?
Bartender, can you pour some love?

And it's closing time, back to yours or mine?
After all this time, you still blow my mind
And it's closing time, back to yours or mine?
After all this time, after all this time

If we keep on drinking we're gon' fall back in love
So fill it up, fill it up
We must not be thinking 'cause we can't get enough
So fill it up, fill it up
Bartender, can you pour some love?
Bartender, can you pour some love?
