There's a tree in my garden
Tall and dark with countless leaves
And it whispers in the air
And it dances in the breeze
And it sways in the storm
But its hold is strong

And like the hope that's come my way
And turns me 'round to face the sky
The rhythm of this world, the gift of life
The essence that can never die

The hope that's come my way
And turns me 'round to face the sky
The rhythm of this world, the gift of life
The essence that can never die

By a river crystal bright
There's a tree where waters flow
Leaves that fall for our healing
Scattered on the world below
Where angels dance and the people sing

A song of hope that's come my way
And turns me 'round to face the sky
The rhythm of this world, the gift of life
The essence that can never die

The hope that's come my way
And turns me 'round to face the sky
The rhythm of this world, the gift of life
The essence that can never die

A song of hope that's come my way
And turns me 'round to face the sky

The song of hope that's come my way
And turns me 'round to face the sky
The rhythm of this world, the gift of life
The essence that can never die

The hope that's come my way
And turns me 'round to face the sky
The rhythm of this world, the gift of life
The essence that can never die
