Against the crushing faith of boredom
Your feelings of indifference unite
The classic hero of your dreams
A lily wash effigy

China white, China blue, time is closing in on you

Blue eyed frenzy with a softness like worlds that collide
This soothing madness should keep me from going blind

Your name burns a hole in the spot where my mind used to be

Let me crash
Let me burn like a flare
Don't try to face me
Let all of this erase me
Every single moment
Sucking time from my veins

But still I'm taking in from the inside
Still I'm breathing nitroglycerine
Taking in from the inside
The primitive taste of what I could have been

Still I ache from the inside
