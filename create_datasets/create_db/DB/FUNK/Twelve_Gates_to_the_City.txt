Three gates in the east
Three gates in the west
Three gates in the north
Three gates in the south
That makes twelve gates to the city Hallelujah

Oh what a beautiful city
Oh what a beautiful city
Oh what a beautiful city
There's twelve gates to the city Hallelujah

Walk right in, you're welcome to the city
Step right up welcome to the city
Walk right through those gates to the city
There are twelve gates to the city Hallelujah

Oh what a beautiful city
Oh what a beautiful city
Oh what a beautiful city
There's twelve gates to the city Hallelujah

Who are those children all dressed in red
Twelve gates to the city
Must be the children that Moses sent
There are twelve gates to the city Hallelujah

Rich and the poor welcome to the city
Young and the old welcome to the city
Weak and the strong welcome to the city
There are twelve gates to the city Hallelujah

Oh what a beautiful city
Oh what a beautiful city
Oh what a beautiful city
There's twelve gates to the city Hallelujah

Oh what a beautiful city
Oh what a beautiful city
Oh what a beautiful city
There's twelve gates to the city Hallelujah
