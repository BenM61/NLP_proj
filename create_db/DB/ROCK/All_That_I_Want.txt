If I could make you love me
I would not want you to
It's you that I want
And not what I want from you

If I could help you see me
The way that I see you
Hope you like what you see
And I hope that it pleases you

I don't care what it takes
From me to give to you
I'll do anything that you ask me to

You're all that I want
You're all that I want

If you could feel my heartache
Each time you walk away
You would never leave
And I would never ask you to stay

If you could only hear me
The way I hear your voice
It would bring you to tears
And I want you to have a choice

I don't care what it takes
From me to give to you
I'll do anything that you ask me to

You're all that I want
You're all that I want

If I could make you love me
I would not want you to
It's you that I want
And not what I want from you

If I could help you see
The way that I see you
Hope you like what you see
And I hope that I please you
