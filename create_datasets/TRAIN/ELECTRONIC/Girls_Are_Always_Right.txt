Well the way the girls act
Is a problem for me
Everything they do is complete mystery
They stand around being so outspoken
They're just waiting for their hearts to be broken

If I can find one I could understand
I'm gonna kiss her feet and shake her hand
Some things are better left to the dead of night
But one thing you better learn
But one thing you better learn
But one thing you better learn
Girls are always right

I stand and watch in anticipation
While you deliver your message to the nation
I'm not your new toy from the bargain basement
I'm not your pride and joy
Im not heaven-sent

If I can find one I could understand
I'm gonna kiss her feet and shake her hand
Some things are better left to the dead of night
But one thing you better learn
But one thing you better learn
But one thing you better learn
Girls are always right
(Don't they just know it?)
Girls are always right
(Don't they just show it?)
Girls are always right
(One false step and you blow it)
Girls are always right
