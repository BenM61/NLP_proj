I can't stop talking to myself
I keep on looking in the mirror
Something is different about me these days
Or maybe I just woke up
I know I'm breaking through my shell
'Cause everything is getting clearer
A little light can make a lot of change
Or maybe I just spoke up
Or maybe I am just finally

Conscious
Haven't gone crazy, I promise
I'm just high up from that harness
Open my mouth 'cause I feel
(Feel, feel, feel)
Conscious
You might say I'm out of pocket
But I got so tired of boxes
Watch me as I keep it real
(Real, real, real)
Conscious

There's a new rhythm in my walk
I'm taking every step on purpose
And I've seen people start to notice
But maybe I just don't care
I know that some will say that I'm lost
I'm eating apples from the serpent
Does my awareness make you nervous?
I'm thankful I'm not still there
I'm thankful that I'm now finally

Conscious
Haven't gone crazy, I promise
I'm just high up from that harness
Open my mouth 'cause I feel
(Feel, feel, feel)
Conscious
You might say I'm out of pocket
But I got so tired of boxes
Watch me as I keep it real
(Real, real, real)

While you spend your time chasing collections
I'll chase a deeper connection
To love more
Live more
Be more

Conscious
Haven't gone crazy, I promise
I'm just high up on that harness
Open my mouth 'cause I feel
Feel, feel, feel
Conscious
You might say I'm out of pocket
But I got so tired of boxes
Watch me as I keep it real
(Real, real, real)

(Watch me as I keep it real)

Conscious
