I faked the humming sucked down honey
Ones preventing while the others coming
Striking repeatedly and sleeping slightly
While snowball waits snowball breaks

It all snowballed
Your humming eyes makes stewball lie
And the offers made about this time
In the upper arm snowball tries
Snowball waits stewball breaks
