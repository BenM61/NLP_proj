Remember how it used to be
It was only you and me
We didn't worry much about anything
And not a dollar to my name
But you loved me just the same
Yeah I felt like I had everything

Holding my hand, walk down the beach
I would pretend that you were my queen
Even though our castle is only in the sand, yeah

Girl we've got something that keeps reminding us
We don't need nothing as long as we got love
Believe it, I mean it, I know we'll always have enough
As long as we got love, love
As long as we got love
As long as we got love

Blink your eyes and here we are
Got a dog and bought a car
Little footsteps down the hall
Life's responsibilities
Sometimes makes it hard to see
The million things about you I adore

But the castles are now more than just sand
So let the rain fall cause we are gonna stay

Boy we've got something that keeps reminding us
We don't need nothing as long as we got love
Believe it, I mean it, I know we'll always have enough
As long as we got love, love
As long as we got love, love
As long as we got love

At the end of the day the city is asleep
I'm wide awake with the girl of my dreams
And all that we've got is the only thing I'll ever need

Boy we've got something that keeps reminding us
We don't need nothing... Oh

Girl we've got something that keeps reminding us
We don't need nothing as long as we got love
Believe it, I mean it, I know we'll always have enough
As long as we got love, love
As long as we got love, love
As long as we got love, love
As long as we got love, love
As long as we got love
