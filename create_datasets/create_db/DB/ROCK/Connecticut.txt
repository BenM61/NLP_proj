One more week and I'm going home
Sitting (downtown)
Eat my tongue
Take a risk
I will search for the real thing
I go
Water's edge
Scary thoughts
A hoping sea
(In sales)
Use any excuse
For what you want
And its not true
Its not true
Bumming
So trying to find you
I'll try to find you
(Ah hell)
Mark the spot
Put an x
Cross my heart
You say I'll use any excuse
For what you want
I 
Will
Never go to sleep
Generous mind
I am not that fine
No I'm not
I am not you
Every word
And I will feel a bad, bad high
