Little boy kneels at the foot of the bed, 
Droops on his little hands, little gold head. 
Sssttt, whisper. Who dares? 
Christopher Robin is saying his prayers: 

"God bless Mommy, I know that's right, 
And wasn't it fun in the bath tonight, 
The cold's so cold and the hot's so hot. 
God bless Daddy, I quite forgot. 

If I open my eyes just a little bit more 
I can see Nanny's dressing-gown on the door; 
It's a beautiful blue but it hasn't got a hood, 
God bless Nanny and make her good. 

Mine has a hood and I lie in bed 
And I pull the hood right over my head, 
And I shut my eyes and I curl up small 
And nobody knows that I'm there at all. 

Thank you God, for a lovely day, 
And what was the other I wanted to say? 
I said, 'Bless Daddy', so what could it be? 
Now I remember: God bless me".
