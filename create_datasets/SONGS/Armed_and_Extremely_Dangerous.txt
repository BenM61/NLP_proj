Calling all cars calling all cars
Be on the lookout for Dangerous Dan
This man is wanted by the F.B.I. - 10-4 

Said he's dangerous, armed and extremely dangerous 

The day he walked into my life he caught me with my guard down 
Don't let him talk his sweet talk on ya 
'Cause I've hit on the bait that he threw and I got hooked
Don't let it happen to you 

Said he's dangerous, armed and extremely dangerous 
Said he's dangerous, armed and extremely dangerous 

The day I came into his charms who would think that he would succeed 
 
Then go on his way leaving me here with another mouth to feed 
So girls if you see him, you might think that you need him 
He might look like the average guy, but he's wanted by the F.B.I. 

Said he's dangerous, armed and extremely dangerous 
Said he's dangerous, armed and extremely dangerous 

Said he's dangerous 
Oh, hell do it - bleed the life from me 
Said he's dangerous 
He don't care for nobody but his self 

Said he's dangerous, armed and extremely dangerous 
Said he's dangerous, armed and extremely dangerous 

Look out girls, he might be 
Walkin' the streets right now 
Said he's dangerous, extremely dangerous
