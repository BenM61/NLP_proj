You're the only bank that's open all night, La Dolce Vita
Now that's clear, can you give me a light, La Dolce Vita
Now that that's clear, when do we eat? La Dolce Vita
Now that that's clear can I have another plate of your
La Dolce Vita

[CHORUS]
Goldiggers arise
Goldiggers are hungry guys
Goldiggers are we
Step up follow me
Mira, mira, guys, there's Lira in her eyes, La Dolce Vita
Looking real bored is what you pay me for, La Dolce Vita
Looking real bored's as hard as scrubbing floors, La Dolce Vita
I'm overpaid but still I'll ask for more, La Dolce Vita
Baby, after all you've got to help the poor, La Dolce Vita

[CHORUS]
Mira, mira, guys, there's Lira in here eyes, La Dolce Vita
I catch a cold just by looking in your eyes, La Dolce Vita
That's just a hazard in work of this kind, La Dolce Vita
Baby you're looking younger every day, La Dolce Vita
I really mean it, it ain't just the pay, La Dolce Vita

[CHORUS]
Mira, mira, guys, there's Lira in her eyes, La Dolce Vita
Life isn't much, but there's nothing else to do, La Dolce Vita
