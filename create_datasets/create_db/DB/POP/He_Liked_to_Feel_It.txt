There was a boy
Who liked to wiggle his tooth loose so he could show it
And then we'd watch
While he would tie it to a doorknob, wind up, and then slam it

And that was how he liked to have his teeth pulled out
He told us how he liked to feel it when it came out

But he grew tired
Of using doorknobs and so he thought up a brand-new trick
He said he'd tie
His tooth to his dog's tail, find a stick, wind up, and then throw it

And that was how he liked to have his teeth pulled out
He told us how he liked to feel it when it came out

He called his dog
But just as he was set to go, his dad arrived there
He yelled at him
Then got some pliers, held him, wound up, and yanked it out right there

That wasn't how he liked to have his teeth pulled out
He wouldn't tell us how it felt when it came out
