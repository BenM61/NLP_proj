You're from the cotton fields
Yeah, but J.A., he's out there bailing hay
He's got muscles

Did you see the cow with the furrowed brow?
He's laughing out
You can pick me up and put me down
Do what you want, you've had enough

I hope I can feel, I hope I'm not blind
I hope I can feel, I hope I'm not blind

Pappa says, "Keep a civil tongue in your head
Don't talk about it?
Just pick right up where you left off
Don't think on it

I hope I can feel, I hope I'm not blind
I hope I can feel, I hope I'm not blind

Weep for her
(Did you see the cow?)
Weep for her
Weep for her
(Did you see the cow?)
Weep for her

Love, lovely, love
Love, lovely, love
Love, lovely, love
Love, lovely, love

Weep for her
(Did you see the cow?)
Weep for her
Weep for her
(Did you see the cow?)
Weep for her

You wounded me again
Tugged at my nerve ends

I hope I can feel, I hope I'm not blind
I hope I can feel, I hope I'm not blind
(Don't talk about it)

You wounded me again
Tugged at my nerve ends

Weep for her
(Did you see the cow?)
Weep for her
Weep for her
(Did you see the cow?)
Weep for her
