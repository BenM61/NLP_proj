Somewhere, where am I
Don't now when I'm high
People lookin' at me
Is there, what did I see

Man with a bible
Won't somebody tell me please
Somebody help me
Tell me what's happened to me

Fever night and day
Woman, hear what I say
Daze all, lighter come
This life won't be long

Man with a bible won't
Somebody tell me please
Somebody help me
Tell me what's happened to me

Woman, hear my plead
Come on, rescue me
Signs all, death has come
Woman look what you've done

Man with a bible
Won't somebody tell me please
Somebody help me
Tell me what's happened to me

Man with a bible
Won't somebody tell me please
Somebody help me
Tell me what's happened to me
To me
