[Chorus: x2]
Buy me diamonds and rubys and crazy bow Bentleys
Gucci dresses and drop top compresses
Wine me and dine me bring those platinum rings
Those are a few of my favourite things

What I need is a gentleman
That does the best he can
There to hold my hand
I want him to understand
Of course I want diamonds and expensive things
'Cause a girl gotta have her favourite things

Males (don't know what they say)

Buy me diamonds and rubies and crazy bow Bentleys
Gucci dresses and drop top compresses
Wine me and dine me bring those platinum rings
Those are a few of our favourite things

I would like a man who would 
Take care of business and still have the time to take
Me on a shopping spree
What mine is yours and what's  yours is mine
If what we have lets put it together and we can shine

Males (don't know what they say)

Buy me diamonds and rubys and crazy bow Bentleys
Gucci dresses and drop top compresses
Wine me and dine me bring those platinum rings
Those are a few of my favourite things

Let me tell you what these are about
You see I'm easy to please but I like expensive things
For me you can buy diamonds and pearls
Its those little things I like in my world

Males (don't know what they say)

Buy me diamonds and rubys and crazy bow Bentleys
Gucci dresses and drop top compresses
Wine me and dine me bring those platinum rings
Those are a few of my favourite things

Diamonds and rubys and crazy bow Bentleys
Gucci dresses and drop top compresses
Wine me and dine me bring those platinum rings
Those are a few of my favourite things
