I'm happy to be here
I'm happy to be with you
For where in a lifetime
Do we do the things we really want to
Now old friends they watch lovers
They wonder where we're going to
They know each look from the other
And they accuse you, accuse you

It's on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and
Don't do this to me, stop listening, start calling my name
Stop turning from me, start feeling I'm here, stop listening
Keep holding me

I'm happy to lie here
Well, I'm happy to touch your face
I've got nothing to fear here
So these feelings, they cannot be placed
Oh, why do you never listen? What do you ever want?
It's funny how I feel like, some kind of person
Another kind of person I would never like to be

Your on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and
Can't do this to you, stop listening, I keep calling your name
I'm not turning from you, start feeling I'm here, stop teasing me
Keep holding me
You can be fragile I don't care I'll always be there

Can't do this to you, stop listening, I keep calling your name yes I do
I'm not turning from you, start feeling I'm here, stop teasing me
Keep holding me
