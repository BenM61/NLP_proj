Deep in the soul of a man whose seen it all
He stands alone with borrowed time
Dealing with two nothings new but the look at you
With broken backs and bleedin' minds

Well I don't know, you know then tell me so
You'll be the one who walks the line, standing tall
They're so fragile, but they always find you when you hide

'Cause your a broken man in a broken land
'Cause your a broken man in a broken land
And don't they wish they were blessed like you

The struggle inside of your mind is a waste of time
Your purest thoughts evaporate
Dark clouds reveal how you feel in your idle time
Your own tail becomes the bait

You don't even know even though your blood flows
Destroy yourself, you're the one you hate, standing tall
They're so fragile, but they always catch you when you're late

'Cause your a broken man in a broken land
'Cause your a broken man in a broken land
And don't they wish they were blessed like you

Standin' tall they look so small with the world up their shoulders
But a broken man on broken land looks far beyond his bothers
Yeah, yeah

Break for the sun you're the one, you're the chosen one
Your time is up your time is due
Craked like a whip from the hand of a broken man
To find out that he's just like you

But you've seen it all in your mind, you've seen it all
You built it up and they made it fall
Because your killing yourself, and you're so fragile
But they cannot crush you if you don't crawl

Now I'm a broken man in a broken land
Now I'm a broken man in a broken land
Now I'm a broken man in a broken land

And don't they wish they were blessed like you
And don't they wish they were blessed like you
And don't they wish they were blessed like you
