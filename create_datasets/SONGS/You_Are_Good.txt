Some would say that You cannot be found
And some would say that You are far away
But I know You're the God who lives in me
And I know You will always have my heart.

'Cause you are good
And Your love endures forever
You are good
And Your love endures forever
You are good
And Your love endures forever
You are good, you are good.

And Your love endures forever

You are the One that I desire
You are the only One, my King.

'Cause you are good
And Your love endures forever
You are good
And Your love endures forever
You are good
