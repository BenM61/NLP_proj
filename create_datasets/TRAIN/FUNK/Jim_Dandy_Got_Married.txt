Jim Dandy done fell in love
Jim Dandy done fell in love
Jim Dandy done fell in love

Jim Dandy rescued May
Fell in love with her the very same day
Got engaged that afternoon
Left that night on his honeymoon

Jim Dandy got married
Love, Jim Dandy, love, Jim Dandy

Jim Dandy gave May a kiss
Fought a lion with his two damn fists
Swam the ocean in a suit of steel
With a sign saying, my love is real

Jim Dandy got married
Love, Jim Dandy, love, Jim Dandy

Jim Dandy got married
Jim Dandy got married
Jim Dandy got married
Love, Jim Dandy, love, Jim Dandy

Jim Dandy was nicknamed Dan
Luckiest cat in all the land

Loved May so well it seems
In a month, she was plum insane

Jim Dandy got married
Love, Jim Dandy, love, Jim Dandy

Jim Dandy was summoned to court
May was suing for non support
Judge, she hollered
He would make you sob
Loving May is a full time job

Jim Dandy got married
Love, Jim Dandy, love, Jim Dandy

Love, love, love, Jim Dandy
Jim Dandy got married
He's real gone this time
Y'all hear, so long, Jim Dandy
He's gone, y'all
I know he won't be back now
