Oh yeah they call me 'The Recluse'
'Cause I don't go outside for nothin', no one
Is gonna make me leave this room
Oh no they can't tell me nothin', no way

You see I'm being a fool
Yes so I don't care about being cool
What's it to you?
If I just stay here in this hole that I boarded into

Oh yeah they call me 'The Recluse'
'Cause I don't go outside for nothin', no one
Is gonna make me leave this room
Oh no they can't tell me nothin', no way

You see I ain't thinkin' clear
Yes so I dunno, I'm feeling sorry for myself
Who asked you to interfere?
Would you really know what is or isn't good for my health?
Why don't you leave me alone?
I ain't hurtin' nobody, why you up in my face?
Get up out my soul
Why can't you just let me get through my time this way?

Oh yeah they call me 'The Recluse'
'Cause I don't go outside for nothin', no one
Is gonna make me leave this room
Oh no they can't tell me nothin', no way, no way, yeah
Can't tell me nothin'
They can't tell me nothin'
They can't tell me nothin'

Sitting here by myself looking mad at myself thinking "I don't wanna go out there"
I don't need no help, looking after myself, I got everything I need right here
I ain't trying to impress anyone in this cesspit jail I just don't care
I ain't gotta smell fresh for a woman so I'm blessed not washing my skin or my hair
They can call me a recluse, they ain't gonna remove or cut me loose from this place, I'm locked in hiding
Like a rocker wall moves 'cause you know I've gotten used to the space that I'm occupying
There really ain't anything out there on the win they'd enjoy more more than see me crying
So I do it in my room where none of these goons can see me though I know they've been trying
I ain't cut out for this shit, I'm a coward I admit, I've never been no big ting
The thought of killing makes me sick, but I don't wanna be no victim no way not Strickland
So I just stay in my cell like I'm bricked in and hope that stops me from getting kicked in
Even if it earns me this nickname in prison

Oh yeah they call me 'The Recluse'
'Cause I don't go outside for nothin', no one
Is gonna make me leave this room
Oh no they can't tell me nothin', no way
Oh yeah they call me 'The Recluse'
'Cause I don't go outside for nothin', no one
Is gonna make me leave this room
Oh no they can't tell me nothin'
