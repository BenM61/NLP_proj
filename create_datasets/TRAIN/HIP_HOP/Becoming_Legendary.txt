Let's make a toast to success 
It tastes so sweet 
Reflectin' on my past 
Thankin' God for blessin me 
I made it on my own 
From the start runnin beats 
To sittin' on the thrown 
Pickin' rappers out my cleats 
Yea I'm feelin' like the greatest 
'96 Pac out in Vegas 
Or '98 Jordan when he made it 
This my last shot 
I want it all before I'm livin' in a cemetery 
I'm only 25 but still Becoming Legendary 

I take a look at all the blessings I've received 
I'm livin' proof with God 1st 
Plus a little hard work 
Just how much you can achieve 
So all you gotta do is dream 
I got the pressure on my back but I can hold it 
'Cause I been workin' hard in preparation for this moment 
I think it's kinda crazy I'm Becoming Legendary 
Now all these legends are becoming my opponent 
The thrown is for the takin' 
So watch me renovate-in this game 
I sit down wit my crown and contemplate my reign 
My only hope when I'm dead and gone 
Will the world remember my name 
Will my music live long 
My picture hang in the hall of fame 
Then I can't complain 
They tried to tell me what I couldn't be 
If I'd a listened I'd a never made this legacy 
So pay attention 
I don't think you n****s hearin' me 
This is the voice of some real life royalty

I'm only 25 but still Becoming Legendary 

I'm lookin' back at everything that I done been through 
And all the people that've hated 
Are the same people sayin' 
I'm the one that they look up to 
They sayin' Yung Stet we love you 
But I don't hear 'em 
I ain't listen 
'Cause them people wasn't there 
When I was grindin' tryna get it 
Rockford, Illinois is on the map 
I finally did it 
I do it for my city 
You can never tell me different 
So if you talkin' legends 
Just be sure you n****s mention-my name 
I put in work for my position 
I step inside the booth and execute wit' such precision 
So pay attention to the verses I be spittin' 
My talent's God given 
It's a sin if you don't listen 
It's kinda crazy now my idols are my rivals 
Eyein' my position out in Paris at the Eiffel 
Focused on survival 
Yea I'm bringin' home the title 
I hope it last forever like a modern day Michael
