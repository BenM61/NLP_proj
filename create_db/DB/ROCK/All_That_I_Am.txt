I can be tough, I can tender
Strong as a saint, weak as a sinner
When I'm in your arms I'm so complete
You bring out what's inside of me

A woman with a mind
A body with a soul
A heart full of love
That won't let go
I love the way you understand
All that I am

I'm a member of the modern world
But sometimes I'm still an old fashioned girl
You make me laugh, you let me cry
I finally found a man who's not afraid to try

A woman with a mind
A body with a soul
A heart full of love
That won't let go
I love the way you understand
All that I am

I'll hold on as long as I can
And keep lovin' you with all that I am
