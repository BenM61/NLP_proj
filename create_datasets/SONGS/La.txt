La is a great big freeway
Many girls have come to you
With a line that was untrue
And you just passed them by

And now your innocent to whim
And their lies don't mean a thing
Why don't you let me drive

I don't need a diamond ring
'Cause you prove your love to me when you say
Sweet and mellow

La la la la la la la la la means I love you
La la la la la la la la la means I love you

Never thought I'd meet a boy
Who could bring me so much joy
You are the one for me

But let me take you in my arms
Surround you with my charms
I'm sure that you will see

The things that I'm saying are true
This is the way that I explain them you
Listen to me

La la la la la la la la la means I love you
La la la la la la la la la means I love you
The things that I'm saying are true
Now I'd bet to spend my whole life through
Loving you
Can't you hear me

La la la la la la la la la means I love you
La la la la la la la la la means I love you

La la la la la la la la la means I love you
La la la la la la la la la means I love you
