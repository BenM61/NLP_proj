Show me the magic
I must have lost it somewhere
In my dreams, so far away
I turn around
Everything's changing but me 
Where is the soul in my song

Once there was heaven in my eyes
Whatever happened to those skies
Somebody show me how to get back 
To a simple life

Out of the blue
Temptation's all around me
Train came along, and I got on board
Danced with the darkness
Skies were the limit
But it's such a long way to fall
 
Once there was heaven in my eyes
Whatever happened to those skies
Somebody show me how to get back 
To a simple life

I've done my time in paradise
I tried it all maybe once or twice
To a simple life

Stars keep me goin'
And the moon is there to light my way
I need to go where my heart is free
Lookin' for the way back
Hopin' to get back to me

Once there was heaven in my eyes
Whatever happened to those skies
Somebody show me how to get back 
To a simple life
