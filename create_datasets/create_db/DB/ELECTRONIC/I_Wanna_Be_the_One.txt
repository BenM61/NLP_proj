Late at night when I'm all alone
I think of you and I'm feelin' strong
Wishin' you would look my way
Let me be the one
My heart is achin' for that special girl
To come on in and to share my world
Someone to love and someone to hold
Let me be the one
I love you

I need you girl and I need you now
I'll get you lookin' at me somehow
The love I have is an open door girl
Come on in, lets begin, I love you

[Chorus:]
I want to be the one you're givin' your lovin'
I want to be the one you're kissin' and huggin'
I want to be the one you dream of at night
Let me be the one
(Repeat 2X)

I love you, baby
I don't believe it should take so long
To find someone I can call my own
Just come more close and you'll feel my love
It's a burning love, my baby
My heart is achin' for that special girl
To come on in and to share my world
Some one to love and someone to hold
Let me be the one, my baby

I need you girl and I need you now
I'll get you lookin' at me somehow
The love I have is an open door girl
Come on in, lets begin, I love you

[Chorus:]
