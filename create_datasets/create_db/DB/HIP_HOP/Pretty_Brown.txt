Is it a crime to want that old thing back?
Can it be wrong to miss the way you used to kiss me?

(Back!) Back in the day
(Back!) Back to the way you used to love me (you used to love me)

Now you've got me ready to break the law again,
Cause I made a vow to rock with you til the end
So, tell me why lately you ain't been the same?
Cause I remember when you said!

Right from the door, said can we talk?
You had me caught, got to admin it love
Let's cut straight to the point,
You know with me is where you belong
Now here we are, how did we grow so much apart?
So far from the start

Keep holding on after all your rejection
Cause I don't wanna let go, but you should know
