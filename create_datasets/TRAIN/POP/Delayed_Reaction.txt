You strike a low blow
You fight a dirty fight
Right to the heart
You're putting me away

Time was movin' slow
But I was in control
There were so many things
I should've said

But couldn't think of one word
Delayed reaction, oh yeah
First I was ashamed
Then I was inflamed
I wanted to hurt you

Saidthat delayed reaction, oh no
First I was alright
And then I had to fight
I wanted to hurt you
I wanted to hurt you so

It was a backlash
No, I couldn't let it pass
I was so mad, I couldn't keep it down
I made it real tough
Ooh, I had to blow you off
I couldn't stand it having you around

I couldn't stand the sound, no
Delayed reaction, oh yeah
First I was ashamed
And then I was inflamed
I wanted to hurt you

Say that delayed reaction, oh no
First I was alright
And then I had to fight with you
I wanted to hurt you
I wanted to hurt you so

But if the rage is right
Oh, you would better be wrong
'Cause if I force a fight
Well, then I'm twice a fool

Ooh, I could've listened more
Was that what you were waiting for?
I can't imagine why, I can't imagine why
I can't imagine why you'd wanna let it go
I didn't wanna blow but

Delayed reaction, oh yeah
At first I was ashamed
And then I was inflamed
I wanted to hurt you

Say that delayed reaction, oh no
At first I was alright
And then I had to fight with you
I wanted to hurt you so

(Delayed reaction, oh yeah)
Ooh, I had to fight, fight, fight you
(Delayed reaction, oh no)
Just let the love blow
You've had a dirty fight

(Delayed reaction, oh yeah)
What good is saying
I lost my head, I didn't mean it, girl
(Delayed reaction, oh no)
Ooh baby, ooh baby
I can't imagine why
You wanna let it go

(Delayed reaction, oh yeah)
Ooh and the boy's so fine
And I'm twice the fool
(Delayed reaction, oh no)
I can't imagine why
