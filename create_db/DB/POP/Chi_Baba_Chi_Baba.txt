Many a year ago in old Sorrento
A certain ditty was quite the thing
Whenever a mother rocked her baby in Sorrento
This little ditty she used to sing

Chi-baba, Chi-baba, Chihuahua
Enjilava kooka la goomba
Chi-baba, Chi-baba, Chihuahua
My bambino go to sleep
Chi-baba, Chi-baba, Chihuahua
Enjilava kooka la goomba
Chi-baba, Chi-baba, Chihuahua
My bambino go to sleep

All the stars are in the skies ready to say good night
Can't you see your doll is sleepy, too?
Close your drowsy little eyes, mama will hold you tight
While she sings a lullaby to you

Oh, Chi-baba, Chi-baba, Chihuahua
Enjilava kooka la goomba
Chi-baba, Chi-baba, Chihuahua
My bambino go to sleep

(Chi-baba, Chi-baba, Chi-baba)
(Chi-baba, Chihuahua, enjilava)
Chi-baba, Chi-baba, Chihuahua
Enjilava kooka la goomba (la goomba)
Chi-baba, Chi-baba, Chihuahua
My bambino go to sleep
(Chi, Chi, Chi-baba)
Chi, Chi, Chi-baba, Chi-baba, Chihuahua
Enjilava kooka la goomba (la goomba)
Chi-baba, Chi-baba, Chihuahua
My bambino go to sleep
(All the stars are in the skies ready to say good night, good night)
(Can't you see your doll is sleepy, too?)
(Close your drowsy little eyes, mama will hold you tight)
(While she sings a lullaby to you, ever so sweetly)
