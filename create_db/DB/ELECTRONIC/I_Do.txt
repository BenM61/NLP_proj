I can sense what you've been thinking 
You wanna know if what I feel 
Is undoubtedly the real thing 
Does your touch give me chills 
If you think I have no interest 
In the things you say and do 
Baby if you close this distance 
I'm gonna prove to you that' 

I'm ready' ready' ready'boy oh wanna play (?) 
Baby come in' cause I got something I wanna say to you (?) 
Gonna tell you whatcha wanna hear boy 
And its oh so true 

Ohhh 
Do I like the way you're kissin me. 
I Do..Yes I Do 
Do I think about the birds and the bees 
You know I Do 
Cause there ain't no ifs or maybes 
Do I wanna be your baby 
Yes I do, I do , I do 

You wanna know 
Do I like the way you complement my style 
Yes I Do 
Do I like the way your jokes can make me smile 
You know I Do 
Been thinking bout it lately 
And I wanna be your baby 
Yes I do, I do, I do 

I can see you got some issues 
You're afraid to let love start 
Many pieces of this puzzle 
Are missin from your heart 
I can heal the pain your feelin 
I can fix the things you fear 
Seems too obvious to mention 
That you're the reason that I'm here.. 
Yeah' Yeah' 

I'm ready' ready' ready' boy oh wanna play (?) 
Baby come in'cause I got something I wanna say to you(?) 
Gonna tell you whatcha wanna hear boy 
And its oh so true 

(Do I Like..)Do I like the way you're kissin me. 
I Do..Yes I Do 
Do I think about the birds and the bees 
Ohhh You know I Do 
Cause there ain't no ifs or maybes 
I wanna be your baby 
Yes I do, I do , I do 

(Do I..) Do I like the way you complement my style 
Yes I Do 
Do I like the way your jokes can make me smile 
You know I Do 
Been thinking bout it lately 
And I wanna be your baby 
Yes I do, I do, I do 

We could melt into the sun 
Water colors start to run 
We'll lie between the blue and green 
Maybe love changes everything 
Tears won't wash away the hurt 
Runnin from it doesn't work 
Cause love changes everything, 
Everything, everything' Everything 

Do I like the way you're kissin me. 
I Do..Yes I Do 
Do I think about the birds and the bees 
You know I Do 
Cause there ain't no ifs or maybes 
Do I wanna be your baby 
Yes I do (I do), Yes I do (I do) , Yes I do (I do) 

Do I like the way you complement my style 
Yes I Do 
Do I like the way your jokes can make me smile 
You know I Do 
Been thinking bout it lately (Thinkin' bout it) 
And I wanna be your baby 
Yes I do, I do, I do 

(I really really really do)
