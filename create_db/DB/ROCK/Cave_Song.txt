Oh, I'm tired and I'm bored
We've waited by the shops for like an hour
Just to get to some cans of 'bow

It's sad, but days they slowly drag
Let's call the local slag and sing it louder
Then we ever have before

Singing
Drinking in the caves
All night, yeah
Singing
Drinking in the caves
All night

We, are children of the streets
Don't listen to a word about tomorrow
'Cause the world is at our feet

It's mad so try and just relax
Smoke another fag and ease your sorrows
'Cause you lads are all I need

Singing
Drinking in the caves
All night, yeah
Singing
Drinking in the caves
All night, ah

This is the anthem of the caves
All night, yeah
This is the anthem of the caves
All night, woah

Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na

Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
