From Jamaica to the world
This is just love
This is just love
Yeah

Why must our children play in the streets
Broken hearts and faded dreams
Peace and love to everyone that you meet
Don't you know, it could be so sweet
Just look to the rainbow, you will see
Sun will shine 'til eternity
I've got so much love in my heart
No one can tear it apart
Yeah

Feel the love generation
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Feel the love generation
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon yeah

Feel the love generation
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Feel the love generation
Ooh yeah-yeah

Why must our children play in the streets
Broken hearts and faded dreams
Peace and love to everyone that you meet
Don't you worry, it could be so sweet
Just look to the rainbow, you will see
Sun will shine 'till eternity
I've got so much love in my heart
No one can tear it apart
Yeah
