Well you're out there, on the highway
While you're drivin', a-roll on by
Goin' south between the bridges
While the river's runnin' dry

And if ya can't come home
Please send your mind

(Send your mind)
(Send your mind)
(Send your mind)
(Send your mind)

Now you're talkin', where ya goin'
On the train that sees the road
'Cross the nation, passing stations
While the night is as black as coal

And if you can't come home
Please send your mind

(Send your mind)
(Send your mind)
Ooo!

(Send your mind)
(Send your mind)

Well, if your handle ain't, on your heartbeat
And your headed between the sheet
And the sign isn't from the lamp post
On the corner of the street

And if ya can't come home
Please send your mind

(Send your mind)
(Send your mind)
