It's another call attentive
But I didn't get the message
Forever due this Mother Earth is all my life

'N the more I think it out
about the time we spend together
together we'll be sharing all eternity

It's another day
It's another way
It's another feeling in my heart

And the more I try to get it
'Cause I did not change the weather
So the light that shines is always coming out of you

For it was ever to be given
Ever full of blessings
As the message coming clearer, see it coming through

So I come
Open to your heart
Make this song
True right from the start

We all live together
We belong together
This Mother Earth and I

All this song will always be
Better by reason
God's clear light
Make sure you feel this life
Flow all inside of you now

All this song will always be
Better by children
Let them sing
For always be the Light

It's another day
It's another way
It's another feeling in my heart

So if ever there's a question
So in part there is an answer
Remember that it's always in the heart of you

To begin this conversation
So intent to get the level
In everything your sacred life is going through

All I know
Want to be with you
Day after day
Want to be with you
And the more I think of it
It can never change me
I believe that this is truly for me

All this song will always be
Better by reason
God's clear Light
Make sure you feel this life
Flow all inside of you now

All this song will always be
Better by children
Let then sing
For always be the light
