I get to thinking that I, that I should call you
I like to think about the first time that I saw you
Thinking about you as if I lost you

I get to thinking that I, that I should call you
I like to think about the first time that I saw you
Thinking about you as if I lost you

It's the sickest kinda feeling I got, won't leave me alone
When you can get your hands out
And you want every little chance that I got
I'll give it away for free

We love to touch
This world needs people to be in love
