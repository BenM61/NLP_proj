Say you've got a right, and who am I to say
But when you do drugs, you get in my way
I'm not gonna waste my breath on you
I'll let your drugs run you through

The things I've been hearing are scaring me
A man made substance that sets your mind free
I can't believe you've gone back on your words
Those drugs are gonna kill you if I don't get to you first

So what are you gonna do, be strong or fold?
Make the wrong choice, you'll do what you're told
I'm stepping back, and I'm gonna judge you
I hope that fucked up head can tell you what to do

I'm keeping it simple
And I'm keeping it clear
And I won't use words
'Cuz you're too fucked up to hear

The crew is strong
And we're setting it straight
And we'll be the judge
Of your fucking fate

You've lost my respect
And I've seen your worst
And I've seen your best
And I won't settle for anything less
I guess you can call me obsessed

You've lost my respect
You've lost my respect
You've lost my respect
Keep clear or take my best
