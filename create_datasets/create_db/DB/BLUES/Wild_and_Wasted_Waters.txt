(Strange things happening in the land
Strange things happening in the land
Wars going on. Hold our heart to mourn
Strange things happening in the land)

Wild and wasted waters (Strange things happening)
Wild and wasted waters (Wars going on)
Wild and wasted waters (Strange things happening)
Have come to carry me, carry me on

Carry me on, my mother's prayers.
Carry me on, my mother's prayers.
Dark waters have come to carry my cares,
So take me on my mother's prayers.
Don't you leave no candle to burn.
Don't leave no candle, to burn.
I leave with the waves, 'neath the stern.
Don't you leave no candle to burn.

Wild and wasted waters.
Wild and wasted waters.
Wild and wasted waters.
Have come to carry me on.
I'll leave with the evening on my breath.
I'll leave with the evening on my breath.
You'll find my letters when I've left.
I'm gonna leave, the evening on my breath.
I won't remember the fires of home
Won't remember the fires of my home.
My homeless bones churn them ragged stones.
I won't remember fires of my home.
Wild and wasted waters.
Wild and wasted waters.
Wild and wasted waters.
Have come to carry me on

May the sickness of my heart be told.
May the sickness of my heart be told.
Let it bleed out in the coffee shop and stagger in the road.
May the sickness of my heart be told
Wild and wasted water
Wild and wasted water
Wild and wasted waters
Have come to carry me
Carry me on, carry me on,
Carry me on, yes there are
