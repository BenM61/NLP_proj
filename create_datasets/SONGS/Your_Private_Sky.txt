Laying in the long grass
Beside your home
Watch the day pass
Your private sky
A gull flies by
And cuts up the air into pulses

Synchronized heartbeat's gone
I own the buried one
Blades growing through my arteries
Will you return and harvest me

If you leave me on my own I'm done

You came and laid down
In a daydream
You smelled like cedar and roses
Skin cool to the touch
Is this real life
Not me making you up

The sky is growing deeper blue
A satellite cuts through the view
I feel the touch of a ghost

Laying in our short past
When I lost you
And we both drew 
Our last breath
