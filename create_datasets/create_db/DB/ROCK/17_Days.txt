Is that my echo?
You mean the straight one?
Can you turn the lights down for me?
Keep going!

Called you yesterday
You didn't answer your phone
The main drag is knowing that
You probably weren't alone

(Turn the voice now a little)
I want to to call you everyday
And beg you to be near me
I know your head is underwater
I doubt that you could hear me

Let the rain come down
The rain come down
Let the rain come down, down
Let the rain come down
Let the rain come down
Let the rain come down, down

Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah aha
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah aha

You've been gone seventeen days
Seventeen long nights
The main drag is knowing that
You're holding someone else tight

I want to to call you everyday
And beg you to be near me
I know your head is underwater
I doubt that you could hear me

Let the rain come down
Rain come down
The rain come down, down
Hey, rain
Oh baby now

Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah aha
Gone seventeen days
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah aha

You've been gone seventeen days
Seventeen long nights
Oh is a drag babe
I know, holding on and make it tight

I wanna call you everyday
And beg you to be near me
I know is underwater
I doubt that you could hear me

Let the rain come down
Come on down, let the rain come down, down
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Come on down in the night
Oh come on down, yeah

Babe 
Yeah ooh, yeah ooh
Come down, oh yeah
Oh oh oh oh oh
Ha, ha ha ha 
Ha, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

That's a new day
Ha, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Come down, let down
Down oh oh oh oh
