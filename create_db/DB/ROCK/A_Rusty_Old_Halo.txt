I know a man as rich as a king
Still he just won't give his neighbors a thing
His day will come, I'll make a bet
He'll get to heaven and here's what he'll get

A rusty old halo skinny white cloud second hand wings full of patches
A rusty old halo skinny white cloud robe that's so wooly and it scratches

Some people have them big shiny cars
Swimming pools fur coats and diamonds in jars
Real silver gates real golden doors
They'll get up to heaven and trade them all for

A rusty old halo skinny white cloud...
[ harmonica ]
While you're on earth you should shine like a star
Brighten up the corner wherever you are
Doing each day the best you can do
That way you're saure that they'll never hand you

A rusty old halo skinny white cloud...
A rusty old halo skinny white cloud...
