When I was a young boy I'd pretend that I had a job
My daddy stayed pretty while my momma married into the mob
I dreamed one day I'd be living off the system for free
But dream's come true, honey, welcome to my reality

And I sleep all day and awake myself in the shadows
(It's time to get up, gotta get up)
I gotta catch that train by midnight for the

Night work, gotta do the night work
Punch that clock and break all the numbers
Night work, gotta do the night work
Weekday nine to five shift is over

Didn't ever pay to know I couldn't, couldn't check with the blade
I used to have the shakes but now they couldn't get in the blade
I sleep all day but I break my back in the moonlight
(It's never enough, it's never enough)
I gotta cash that check by midnight for the

Night work, gotta do the night work
Punch that clock and break all the numbers
Night work, gotta do the night work
Weekday nine to five shift is over

Night work, gotta do the night work
Punch that clock and break all the numbers
Night work, gotta do the night work
Weekday nine to five shift is over

And when the whistle blows and your body can't take it no more
You gotta keep on moving, remember, this is what you asked for

N-n-n-n-n-na
Ooh hoo
The night work
N-n-n-n-na, do the night work
Oh oh night work
Gotta do the night work 
Nine to five sift is over
