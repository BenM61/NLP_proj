"Order wings for the week of all designs - sign them over to me"
"Oh no they're sure as ever to see"
"I don't care"
"Then another day"

"Well maybe. Send some more rain down there"
"Summer rain? Insane eyes empty rooms"
"Won't goad no one"
"That's all there is"

"Don't scare me"
"Only wish we could breeze over these involuntary nosebleeds, fall asleep for the days when there was power, terror and greed"
"Don't go there. Only wish we could breeze over these higher mountains to those beds, fall asleep for 
a while among these dandelions and leaves"

"So calm there. Though it's hard to believe that this was all that we could achieve. For now you're lying down on your knees"
"Oh no dear I only want to appease"
"So calm me... No no no no no no not the last blast again..."
