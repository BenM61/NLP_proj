I travel light
You wont even notice that I'm passing through
My voice is a whisper that you hardly hear
But my perfume you remember

Do I complain
Do I belong to anyone or anywhere
My skin is black but so is Gigi Youngs
And Snowwhite is my mother.

Oh will I ever get to the end of my journey
All I know for sure is were all made
Made of the same flesh and blood
Just happens to be made in Europe

This Venice bed
Makes me recall a memory I close my eyes
And Grand Canal turns into a Swedish lake
Or is it Lake Genova?

That Danish hand
Seems to do wonders for my fantasy
I seem to recall Paris You and me
Oh that hand in Barcelona

Oh will I ever get to the end of my journey
All I know for sure is were all made
Made of the same flesh and blood
Just happens to be made in Europe

Will I ever get to the end of my journey
All I know for sure is were all made
Made of the same flesh and blood

Oh will I ever get to the end of my journey
All I know for sure is were all made
Made of the same flesh and blood
Made of the same flesh and blood
Made in Europe
