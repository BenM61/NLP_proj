Sometimes I get into deep trouble
Illusions burst like a big bang bubble
Squeeze please knocking about
Nonsense that's the way out

Squeeze please
Squeeze please

I never wanna ever talk about the big boom bang
Can't you understand is this another the band
The big bang bean what you mean
The big bang bay what do you say

Squeeze please knocking about
Nonsense that's the way out

Squeeze please knocking about
Nonsense that's the way out

Squeeze please
Squeeze please
