All My Love, I give you All My Love,
The skies may fall, my love 
But I will still be true.
All my sighs will disappear at last,
Now that you're here at last,
My heart belongs to you.
Oh, don't you ever let me go,
You thrill me so.
I can see, as I recall my life, 
I've waited all my life 
To give you AL My Love.
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay,
