I spent all my money at the House of Guitars
I've been trying to take a break but it's just so hard
I should save the money to fix my car
I've been trying to get home but it's just so far

I just want to be content
No matter where I am
I guess I shouldn't have to take the chance
I'm gonna get back to the city where I live

So I drove downstate in a broken car
I've been six long weeks, every night in a bar
It's hard to find some rest in a place you don't know
I fell asleep on a tarp on the ground 'neath the stars

I just want to be content
No matter where I am
I guess I shouldn't have to take the chance
I'm gonna get back to the city where I live

It feels like I grew up too late
Been refusing to finish everything on my plate
I've been spending most of my time
Trying to find some peace of mind

I'm walking to the store, I sold my car
Don't need a car
Anyway, it's a nice day outside and it's not that far
