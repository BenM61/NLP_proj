Puppet on a string, all that I am
Pull a little harder and watch me dance
I can't control what I can't understand, for now
Everybody wants you to fit with their plans
Some want the cynical and some want romance
Some want the chemicals to bring on a trance, for now
At night I rest, at night I sleep

The whole world turns around
I pray the lord my soul to keep
Until it comes around again
Puppet on a string, all that I am
Everybody wants me to fit with their plan
I can't control what I don't understand, for now
Some want the cynical and some want romance

Some want the chemicals to bring on a trance
Fate oscillator making crazy demands, for now
At night I rest, at night I sleep
The whole world turns around
I pray the lord my soul to keep
Until it comes around again
Puppet on a string, all that I am
Puppet on a string, watch me dance

Puppet on a string, it's out of my hands, for now
Puppet on a string, all that I am
Puppet on a string, watch me dance
Puppet on a string, it's out of my hands, for now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, puppet on a string
Mmhmm, puppet on a string, yeah, yeah
