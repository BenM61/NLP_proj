Come on, the night is young.
Seek me out because I'm ready to get stung.
So long, so long, feed me.
Come on, show me, come on, need me.

Come on, show me the way.
Come on, need me in that way, so long. 
You just never ever get what you want! 
You just never ever get what you need! 

Come on, you deserve me. 
Come on, it's the thought of you in my veins. Come on, show me the way. 
Come on, show me the feeling, so long. 
You just never ever get what you want! 
You just never ever get what you need! 
Get what you want! Get what you need
