I've been weeping silent like a wound
Would you stitch me up
Or let the blood soak through?
Watching my world turn from white to maroon

Ignore my claws
Look into my eyes
And convince us both
That I'll last through the night

I could land on my feet if I tried
I never jumped a chasm so wide
And made it to the opposite side
Even now, as we are, standing here
I can see the doubt in your eyes
I can smell the animal fear
(I can smell the animal fear)

Hold my body, trembling fur and tooth
I won't bite, or did I speak too soon?
Treacherous light that ignites the moon

And she calls my name
And I howl her tune
But the hunters slay
By the clair of the moon

I was raised with my face to the skies
But I was not a heavenly child
Savage, with a temperament wild
Even here, as we are, standing now
I can see the fear in your eyes
I can taste the sweat I your brow
I can smell the animal fear
(I can smell the animal fear)
