And if I say to you tomorrow
Take my hand, child, come with me
It's to a castle I will take you
Well what's to be, they say will be

Catch the wind, see us spin, sail away, leave today, way up high in the sky
But the wind won't blow, I really shouldn't go, it only goes to show
That you will be mine, by takin' our time

And if you say to me tomorrow
Oh what fun it all would be
Then what's to stop us, pretty baby
But what is and what should never be

Catch the wind, see us spin, sail away, leave today, way up high in the sky
But the wind won't blow, I really shouldn't go, it only goes to show
That you will be mine, by takin' our time

So if you wake up with the sunrise
And all your dreams are still as new
And happiness is what you, you need so bad
Well girl, the answer lies with you

Catch the wind, see us spin, sail away, leave today, way up high in the sky
But the wind won't blow, I really shouldn't go, it only goes to show
That you will be mine, by takin' our time

Ooh, oh 
Well, the wind wont blow and it really shouldn't go and it only goes to show
Catch the wind, we're gonna see it spin, we're gonna sail, little girl

Do do do, bop bop a do-oh
My my my my my my yeah
Everybody I know seems to know me well
But does anybody know I'm gonna move like hell
