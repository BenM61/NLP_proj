Who can make a million fans up off one track
A backpackin' popstar with a skater pass
Girls love it when I sing but I love to rap
They get their eyes on this money like they wear a patch
I don't tell 'em that I'm broke where's the fun in that?
We at college playing shows, get a ton of ass
Dudes say I make songs for the culo
Girls ask me what the hell the mad at you for
Same reason they was mad at Menudo
I get girls and rap nerds watch Naruto
These girls are pretty fast no kissing
Still come at your Johnson if you only get some clit in
Music's your dream - no patience
Hordes back to work in here with no pension

Hey little diddy wassap now
Hey wassap now
Hey little diddy wassap now
Yeah
A million fans ain't living in my home,
But I'm making me a million and I'm paying what I owe

But I'm making me a million and I'm paying what I owe
Wassap now

I'm a color not another black rob
Stack go buzz till they turn to Steve Jobs
I gotta make a million, to make a difference
Hate if you want, long as you listen
Flow coded and convenience store refreshments
Head of my class I'm beating on the freshmen
I use money but I am not the next man attracted to this metal
Like we tryna kill an X-man
Emo my lyrics are feeding off depression
Caused by the last decade of recession
School loans are starting to be a bitch
So I just quit school and I'm starting to get rich or
Die tryin', turn into a giant
Here to add value to this music that I'm writing

If anything's good, there's a rare amount
So stop giving me songs that I don't care about
I'm not concerned with your past or your whereabouts
Used to never claim that I rap, so I'm try it out
Flow somethings new, beats borrowed
And I can guarantee a million fans follow
An outcast with rage against machines
Transform art to slave for companies
Homeboy Green, been pavin' out the dream
Since I hang from trees and scraped my dungarees
You can't change the world from writing songs
But I have civil rights because of a microphone
Though a million ain't fittin' in my home
I'm making me a million and I'm paying what I owe
