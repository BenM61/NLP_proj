Have you heard these blues
That I'm gonna sing to you
When you hear them they will thrill you 
Through and through 
There the sweetest blues you ever heard
Now listen and don't say a word

Sugar blues 
Everybody's singing the sugar blues
The whole towns ringing
My loving man sweet as can be 
But the doggone fools 
Turned sour on me
I'm so unhappy 
Feel so unhappy 
I could lay me down a die
You could say what you choose
But I'm all confused
I got the sweet, sweet sugar blues 
More sugar 
I've got the sugar blues

Sugar blues
Every singing the sugar blues
My loving man sweet as can be 
But the doggone fools 
Turned sour on me
I'm so unhappy 
Feel so unhappy 
I could lay me down a die
You could say what you choose
But I'm all confused
I got the sweet, sweet sugar blues 
More sugar 
I've got the sugar blues

Yea!
