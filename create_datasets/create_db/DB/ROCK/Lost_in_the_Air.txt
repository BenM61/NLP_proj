Radar, you lost me
An impossible disguise
Men all around are searching hard
Never mind, he's so long and gone
Boy, he's really hard to find!
And by design you know he won't be found

Otherwise he'll crash into the ground
Lifted away
What a day to be lost in the air!
They won't come across me
Hiding in the sky
'Cause nobody walks without their heads

Pointed down at the ground in a daze
Well, it's amazing what you'd find
And by design you know i won't come down
Otherwise I'll crash into the ground
Lifted away
What a day to be lost in the air!
