Circulate around the room
A collection of truths
I inhale with no choice
But to accept

Full but not satisfied
My thirst for clarity
Drowning under the weight
Of influence gasping for air
Yet holding on to a thought of my own

Disclosure

If you isolate your thoughts you will
Clear your perception to see the world
Free of influence, free of control

Disclosure

Satellites have blinded truth unknown
Hidden in plain sight
In a sea of pollution
We are drifting away

Disclosure

If you isolate your thoughts you will
Clear your perception to see the world
Free of influence, free of control

Disclosure
