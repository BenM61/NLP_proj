Come on honey let me turn you on, 
Let's get it right from the start, 
We got us more than silver and gold, 
We got a heart full of rhythm and rock n' roll

Something's shaking and it just won't stop, 
Let's get to movin' before they call the cops, 
So come on honey won't ya take my hand, 
We got heart full of rhythm they don't understand, 
I'll give you more than silver and gold, 
I got a heart full of rhythm and rock n' roll

Lay me on down cause I'm your man, 
It don't take much to understand this love

Oh come on honey let us turn it on, 
Lets get it right from the start, 
Our love will never be bought or sold, 
We got a heart full of rhythm and rock n roll, 

Come on honey we got nothing to lose, 
We got the country and the rhythm and the blues, 
We ain't living in a promise land, 
We got a heart full of rhythm in a wonderland, 
I'll give you more than silver and gold, 
I got a heart full of rhythm and rock n roll

Lay me on down cause I'm your man, 
It doesn't take much to understand my love, 
With a heart full of rhythm and rock n roll

Oh come on honey let me turn you on, 
Lets get it right from the start, 
Our love will never be bought or sold, 
We got a heart full of rhythm and rock n roll

Come on honey we got nothing to lose, 
We got the country and the rhythm and the blues, 
I told you honey now that I'm your man, 
I got a heart full of rhythm they don't understand, 
I'll give you more than silver gold, 
I got a heart full of rhythm and rock n roll... 

Tell me honey now that I'm you're man, 
Lay me down a little bit longer, 
It don't take much to understand this love, 
With a heart full of rhythm and rock n' roll
