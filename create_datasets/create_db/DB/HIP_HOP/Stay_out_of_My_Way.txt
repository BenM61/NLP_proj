[Intro] 
Hey yo  dogs  for real? 
I'm yo' man but you got the address up 
'cause now you got chicks talk' "What the f*ck" 
"What the f*ck"  "what the f*ck" 

[Mase] 
You know somebody swung on me & cut me? 
(Come on come on come on) 
You know somebody pulled a gun on me or robbed me? 
(Come on come on come on) 
Is they stoppin' my money? (Hell no) 
(Come on come on come on) 
Then it ain't no problem here 
(Come on come on come on) 
c'mon I ain't wit that man 
(Yeah, what, what) 
Just throw my be	 back on 

Yo, yo, yo 
You know my mission ain't complete 
'Till I hit the city with a 600 Jeep 
Hardest nigga from All Out you want to meet 
Hash in the dash with heat under the seat 
Chased Kate 52 states straight 
But still ain't nothin' sweet 
I took a year off to let the young nigga's eat 
Everybody wit' me want bucks 
Walk around platinum linked up 
With money like Brink trucks 
Shit get too hot? Puff, put the minks up 
Come back in the summertime like f*ck it, it's summertime 
All Out tattoo's over wife beaters 
Get mail Branson, never buy reefer 
Bentley five seater, it's all for real 
First rapper to close down a mall with a mil' 
The clothes, the hoes, the cars that flaunt 
Plus the money so I'm on nigga one 
Talk to me 

1 - [Total] 
If you don't f*ck with me 
Like I don't f*ck with you 
It ain't much for us to talk about 

'cause you don't f*ck with me (Yo, yo, yo, yo) 
And you know I don't f*ck with you 
So all I can say (uh uh) 
Is stay out my way 

[Mase] 
Don't take much to wake up, taped up 
F*ck the district, I live in Jacob 
Hit a nigga, bitch nigga, kiss and made up 
See me without Puff, try to get your weight up, uh 
Ain't nuttin' between you and me 
And on the real, nuttin' you could do wit me 
I got cats that'll find you and leave you 
Pull that hoodie over your head 
And put five in your Caesar 
Doubt me now and die a believer 
Run and catch bullets like a wide receiver 
When the war's on, put your gloves and your Gore's on 
Teflon hard hat nigga, put it all on 
Beef no more that's what other nigga's for 
I got a fam' that love to go to war 
Love to get locked up, love pickin' the odds up 
Love not comin' home, love to be boxed up 
I'm from a town where kids could pop up 
Little punks in garbage bags, body all chopped up 
I'll come around your block knowin' you got popped up 
Arms are rocked up, Bentley wit' the top up 
Uh, you don't stop, come on 

[Repeat 1 while: ]
What, what, what 
Yeah yeah yeah what what what 
You don't like me nigga? (What the f*ck?) 
You want to fight me nigga? (Huh? huh?) 
Stop frontin' nigga (You frontin' nigga) 
Uh 

[Mase] 
Yo, one, two, three, four 
Everybody on the floor 
You see grams, I'mma see craters 
By the time you see land I'mma see acres 
Drop another CD just to see paper 
And before you see me you'll see the maker 
All I see is more chances, more advances 
More houses, no spouses, more beaches 
Wild thugs around me and no leechin' 
When they gun's out played, there'll be no reachin' 
Ballin' in Dirty South wit' no creases 
And all I see is more F-in' iced out Jesus pieces 
The rock over Sean John fleeces 
You never love the money like we love it 
Pay the chick sucka, and let her teeth touch it 

All Out 
Bad Boy forever 
The Movement 
What
