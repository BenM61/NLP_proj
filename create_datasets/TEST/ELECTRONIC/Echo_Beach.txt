I know it's out of fashion
And a trifle uncool
But I can't help it
I'm a romantic fool
It's a habit of mine
To watch the sun go down
On Echo beach, I watch the sun go down

From nine till five I have to spend my time at work
The job is very boring, I'm an office clerk
The only thing that helps me pass the time away
Is knowing I'll be back at Echo Beach some day

On a silent summer evening
The sky's alive with light
A building in the distance
Surrealistic sight

On Echo Beach
Waves make the only sound
On Echo Beach
There's not a soul around

From nine till five I have to spend my time at work
The job is very boring, I'm an office clerk
The only thing that helps me pass the time away
Is knowing I'll be back at Echo Beach some day

Echo Beach
Far away in time
Echo Beach
Far away in time

Echo Beach
Far away in time
Echo Beach
Far away in time

Echo Beach
Far away in time
Echo Beach
Far away in time

Echo Beach
Far away in time
Echo Beach
Far away in time

Echo Beach
Far away in time
Echo Beach
Far away in time

Echo Beach
Far away in time
Echo Beach
Far away in time

Echo Beach
Far away in time
Echo Beach
Far away in time

Echo Beach
Far away in time
Echo Beach
Far away in time

Echo Beach
Far away in time
