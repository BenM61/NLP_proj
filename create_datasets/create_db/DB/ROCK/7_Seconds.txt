Did you get this far
Did you get this far, just to hurt me
Did you get this far, to realize that you don't, you don't deserve me

Need you to move me
Need not point it out
Need no sayin' exactly that

It can't be that far behind
I don't remember we've been stepping over it

If  I sold out to the underway
Than it's really hard to say
And anyway I got nothing to show for it

I know you
In to this and out of that in seven seconds flat
Whatever you do
You take it to the to point where it's me
Not you, and you really did not attack

Whatever you do, you've got to cut it out quick
If this is some kind of trick
I've got no way to see you trough it, no

Yeah whatever you do, you've got to cut it out quick
If this is some kind of trick,
I've got no way to see you through it

I know you
In to this and out of that in seven seconds flat
Ah got on the road
Need not spell it out
Need not saying exactly that

Ah yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah
