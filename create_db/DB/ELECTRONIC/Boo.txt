Do not fear me,
I bring no harm,
No one knows where I came from,
I walk on water all day long,
No one knows how far I came,
No one even knows my name,
I sometimes sing as I float,
No one ever hears a note,
I sometimes move from place to place,
No one ever sees my face,
I can't touch I can't weep I can't taste I can't sleep,
I appear I disappear I reappear I'm getting near,
I'm tired of living in my brain,
I feel no joy I feel no pain,
I don't live I just exist,
I need to know the life I missed,
I'm the only one host I'm this town,
I'm the only ghost in the lost and found,
I'm the only one if you look around,
Reappear I'm getting near.
