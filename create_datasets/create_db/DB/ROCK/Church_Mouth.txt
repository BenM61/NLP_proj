Sell me, I'm a skeptical boy
And if you need help I'm not easy to find
We met the man in the deep, deep south
With the gritty smile and the dirty old church mouth

Papers, read and weigh down the stands
It's cold out here and waiting weighs on this man
Still not full, I need a pass and a page
March stepped some steps and it spoke some words
Thinking about that dirty old church mouth

(My breath was short, better hit the ground running)

I'll feel better when that sleep comes and finds me
(My salt was skin of maps made whole
Gotta get out, gotta sell this soul)
I'll feel better when that sleep comes and finds me
(Stroll about through these forks and roads
Find me in the pines, in the sleet and cold)

Shine on, in this brilliant paced pulse
All I need in this life is this love
We met the man in the deep, deep south
With with the shifty teeth smile
That poured about the church's mouth

(March stayed with the dirty old church mouth)

I'll feel better when that sleep comes and finds me
(My salt was skin of maps made whole
Gotta get out, gotta sell this soul)
I'll feel better when that sleep comes and finds me
(Stroll about through these forks and roads
Find me in the pines, in the sleet and cold)

Fill me up with money-gold, ain't nobody ever needs me
Take me to the steeple, let the preachers hands a'bathe me

I'm going down, down to the river, ain't nobody needs me
(Fill me up with money-gold, ain't nobody ever needs me)
Out in the water let those man's hands a'bathe me
(Take me to the steeple, let the preachers hands a'bathe me)
Down, down, down, down, down
(Fill me up with money-gold, ain't nobody ever needs me
Take me to the steeple, let the preachers hands a'bathe me)

We met the man in the deep, deep south
With the gritty smile and the dirty old church mouth

(March stayed with the dirty old church mouth)
(Fill me up with money-gold, ain't nobody ever needs me)

I'll be better when that sleep comes and finds me
I'll be better when that sleep comes and finds me

I'll be better when that sleep comes and finds me
(Fill me up with money-gold, ain't nobody ever needs me)
I'll be better when that sleep comes and finds me
(Fill me up with money-gold, ain't nobody ever needs me)
