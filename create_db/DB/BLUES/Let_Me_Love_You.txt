If you would let me love you, baby
 There is nothing in the world I wouldn't do for you
 Yes if you would let me love you, baby
 Ain't nothing in the world I wouldn't do for you
 I would even try to walk on water, woman
 If you would just say,
 "Baby I love you too"
 If you let me love you, baby
 I'll buy you a car made of gold
 I'll even give you a fountain of youth, baby
 So you will never grow old
 Just let me love you, woman
 Ain't nothing I wouldn't do in this world
 I want you to call me your boy, woman
 Baby, and I'm gonna call you my girl
 Yeah, I'll hire you a teacher, baby
 To read you storybooks
 I'll make you a talkin' mirror, woman
 Just to tell you how good you look
 Ain't nothing I wouldn't do in this world
 I want you to call me your boy, woman
 Baby, and I'm gonna call you my girl
 Yes, I'm gonna fall on my knees
 Would even call the Lord
 Just to seed the dimple, baby
 In your cheeks when you smile
 Let me love you
 Ain't nothing in the world I wouldn't do for you
 I say I would try to walk the water, baby
 If you say that you love me too
