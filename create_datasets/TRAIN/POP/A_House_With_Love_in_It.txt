A house with love in it is rich indeed
Although there are a thousand things 
That house may need
The carpet may be old

The room so plain and bare
And yet, it's beautiful somehow
When love is living there
A house with love in it 

Just seems to bloom
As tho the month of May 
Were filling every room
So, darling, through the years

With all my heart I'll pray
A house with love in it 
Is where we'll stay
