Staring through the windows of time
Drying off the last year of our bind
Was it real or just a mirage
Love has it's way of making you blind
I stared deep into your heart and your soul
And I feel what any woman would want
Why did I run? Why did I hide?
Because the memories bleed on and on

Time goes on and the feelings stay strong
Memories laugh and play with my heart
Like thunder in a rainstorm

Tell me is this real or just a mirage
I ask myself

Could this be love
Or just a memory
Of the two of us together
Lifetime friends forever
You and me a unity
Of friendship and love

As we moved our separate ways that day
Tears ran down my face
And I asked myself
Was I just too weak to face the truth
That love is what I have for you
You're someone special deep down inside
Your love is true, why did I hide?
Why did I run? Why did I hide?
Because the memories bleed on and on

Time goes on and the feeling stays strong
This word called love- are you the one? That I want
Tell me is this real or just a mirage
I ask myself
Could this be love
Or just a memory
Of the two of us together
Lifetime friends forever
You and me a unity
Of friendship and love
