Groovy people
I like to be around
Groovy, groovy people

I don't like nobody that's got an ego
I don't like to sit around and hold a conversation
With somebody who don't know where he wants to go

Give me the simple life
Full of fun and joy
Can't you see, I'm just a big ol' country boy

And I like groovy people
I'm talking 'bout
Groovy, down home people

I don't like nobody that's got an attitude
Walkin' 'round with their nose in the air
Them kind of people, I just can't use

I like to be relaxed
With my mind at ease
The best things in life
Is all I want for me

So give me some, groovy people
I said, groovy, groovy people
Talkin' 'bout groovy, groovy
Groovy, groovy people

Now baby, oh darlin', we don't have to put up
With them jive-time folks no more
Let's pretend that we're not at a-home
When they come knockin', knockin' on our door

I don't like nosy people
Get in my business and things
I done been through all of that, baby
And I know the bad feelings that it brings

Give me the simple life
Full of fun and joy
Can't you see I'm just a big ol' country boy?
