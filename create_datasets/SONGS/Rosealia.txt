Where have you gone, my Rosealia?
Into the crowd, he'll never find you
If you walk real fast and you stay down low
So many times, so many chances, this one could be your last

You say no, no, no
The fighting has left you tired
You say no, no, no
But the fighting goes on

Put on your mask, wearing your cape
Put on your mask, my Rosealia
Put on your mask, wearing your cape
Put on your mask, my Rosealia

What has he done, my senorita?
His kind of love is going to kill you
Do you fake a smile when you dodge the blows?
So many times, so many chances, this one could be your last

You say no, no, no
The fighting has left you tired
You say no, no, no
But the hurting goes on

Put on your mask, wearing your cape
Put on your mask, my Rosealia
Put on your mask, wearing your cape
Put on your mask, my Rosealia

Jealousy can rip your heart out
And jealousy can turn a hand into a fist

You say no, no, no
The fighting has left you tired
You say no, no, no
But the fighting goes on

Put on your mask, wearing your cape
Put on your mask, my Rosealia
Put on your mask, wearing your cape
Put on your mask, my Rosealia

Put on your mask, wearing your cape
Put on your mask, wearing your cape
My Rosealia
My Rosealia
