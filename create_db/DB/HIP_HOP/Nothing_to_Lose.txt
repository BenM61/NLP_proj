I've been living my life
But it isn't fair
Woulda never thought I'd be
Down in this gutter

If I can make it here
I can make it anywhere
When the going gets tough
I've gotta get tougher

Sometimes you only get one shot
I've gotta give it all I got

'Cause I ain't got nothing to lose
So much to prove
I get to far to hear no
Gotta go hard or go home
I ain't got nothing to lose
I gotta do what I gotta do

(I ain't got nothing)

Oh, how the hell did my back
Get against the wall
Never thought that I would
Be here at rock bottom, oh oh

At least I don't have to worry
About the phone
Why did I end up with 99 problems

Sometimes you only get one shot
I've gotta give it all I got

'Cause I ain't got nothing to lose (I ain't got nothing)
So much to prove (I got so much to prove to you)
I get to far to hear no
Gotta go hard or go home
I ain't got nothing to lose
I gotta do what I gotta do (oh, I ain't got nothing)
