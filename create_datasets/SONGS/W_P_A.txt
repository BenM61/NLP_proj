Now wake up, boys, get out on the rock
It ain't daybreak, but it's four O'clock

Oh, no, no, no, Pops, you know that ain't the play

What you talkin' 'bout? It's the W.P.A.

The W.P.A.
The W.P.A.

Sleep while you work, while you rest, while you play
Lean on your shovel to pass the time away
T'ain't what you do; you can't die for your pay

The W.P.A.
The W.P.A.
The W.P.A.

Now don't be a fool; working hard is passe
You'll stand from five to six hours a day
Sit down and joke while you smoke; it's okay

The W.P.A.

I'm so tired, I don't know what to do
Can't get fired, so I'll take my rest until my work
Is through

The W.P.A.
The W.P.A.

Don't mind the boss if he's cross when you're gay
He'll get a pink slip next month anyway
Three little letters that make life okay

The W.P.A.
