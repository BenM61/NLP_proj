Love is the only thing that matters
Love is the only thing that's real

I know we hear this every day
It's still the hardest thing to feel

This time
When I go back to Ludlow Street
I find each stoop and doorway's incomplete
Without you there

Another generation's parties
And it is still the same old scene
I can recall each morning after
Painted in nicotine

This time
When I go back to Ludlow Street
I find each stoop and doorway's incomplete
Without you there

All of the people I once knew...
All of the ones I was close to...

Love is the only thing that matters
Love the only thing that's real

And when I think about you now
Love is the only thing I feel

This time
When I go back to Ludlow Street
I find each stoop and doorway's incomplete
Without you there

Tim, this time
When I go back to Ludlow Street
I find each stoop and doorway's incomplete
Without you there
