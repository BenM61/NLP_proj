Count me out
Count me out

Fellas want to hang
And save tonight just
For the gang
But you'll have to count me
Out this time 
If I can't bring my girl

Don't look surprised
When I tell you that
Gotta spend some time
With my baby, yes

So if that means
We're gonna rain on
Your parade

You'll have to count me out
You're gonna have to count me out
You'll have to count me out

I want to be with my girlfriend
You'll have to count me out this time
You'll have to count me out

When she asked me please
Could I say no and feel at ease
If you count me out tonight
She's gonna be with me wherever
I go

She's got a sweet personality
She saves her kisses just for me
So if that means we're gonna rain on your parade

You'll have to count me out
You're gonna have to count me out
You'll have to count me out
I'm saving kisses for my baby

You'll have to count me out this time
You'll have to count me out

You'll have to count me out
You're gonna have to count me out
You'll have to count me out
My baby wants to be with me
You'll have to count me out
That's the way it's gonna be
You'll have to count me out

Count me out
Count me out

You'll have to count me out
You're gonna have to count me out
You'll have to count me out
I want to be with my girlfriend

You'll have to count me out this time
You'll have to count me out this time
You'll have to count me out

You'll have to count me out
You're gonna have to count me out
You'll have to count me out
I'm saving all my loving for her

You'll have to count me out this time
You'll have to count me out

I love my baby but she's just a tease
And when I need her I say please, please, please
Can I hold you,
Squeeze you,

'Cause I need you
Count me out
You'll have to count me out this time

Don't count me out
Don't leave me out
You'll have to count me out 
this time

You'll have to count me out
Count me out
You'll have to count me out
You'll have to count me out
Count me out
You'll have to count me out

Man, we're going to the movies
Then to the park, to play a little ball 'til it get dark
That's what being young is all about
Man, see-O-you-N-T me out

Well what about us,
We're your friends
We want to see-O-you-N-T 
me in,
No not tonight
Where you going then
Tonight I want to be with my girlfriend

You'll have to count me out
You'll have to count me out
You'll have to count me out
You'll have to count me out
this time
You'll have to count me out

Count me out
Count me out
Count me out

Don't count me out
Don't leave me out

You'll have to count me out
You're gonna have to count me out
You'll have to count me out
I'm saving kisses for my baby

You'll have to count me out this time
You'll have to count me out

You'll have to count me out
You're gonna have to count me out
You'll have to count me out

You'll have to count me out this time
You'll have to count me out
