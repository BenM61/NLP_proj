I don't need no wheels
I don't need no gasoline
Cause the wind that is blowing
Is blowing like a smoke machine

If I said to you
That I was looking for a place to get to
Cause my neck is broken
And my pants ain't getting no bigger

I got a stolen wife
And a rhinestone life
And some good old boys
I'm writing my will
On a three dollar bill
In the evening time

All my friends
Tell me something is getting together
I got a beard that would disappear
If I'm dressed in leather
Now let me tell you about my baby
She was born in Arizona
Sitting in the jail house
Trying to learn some good manners

I got a stolen wife
And a rhinestone life
And some good old boys
I'm writing my will
On a three dollar bill
In the evening time

Match sticks strike
When I'm riding my bike to the depot
Cause everybody knows my name
At the recreation center

If I could only find a nickel I would pay myself off tonight
Cause nobody knows
When he good times have passed out cold
I got a stolen wife
And a rhinestone life
And some good old boys
I'm writing my will
On a three dollar bill
In the evening time

I got a stolen wife
And a rhinestone life
And some good old boys
I'm writing my will
On a three dollar bill
In the evening time

Don't talk to me
If you're looking for somebody to cry on
Don't talk to me
If you're looking for somebody to cry on
Ah!
