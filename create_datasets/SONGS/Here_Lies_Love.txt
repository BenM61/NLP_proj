Night winds cold and melancholy 
Wail the ? and holly
Oh my tragedy 

Like a misery 
Made for only me
While I linger weary
'Neath a willow tree

Right here our romance was started
Here again we parted 
When I set you free

All my thoughts are jumbled
Everything is blurred
Oh the world has crumbled
Shattered by a word

The end has come 
By heart is numb
Was like a volt from the blue above
I can't believe it 
But you're gone darling
And here lies love

The skies dark
And I hear a lark
He sounds as sad as a mournful dove
The dew appears like the tears of gone
Darling for here lies love

All my dreams lost beyond recall
Dreams of spring blessed within the fall 
You gave lips
You gave arms
I gave all 

I ought to cry
My eyes are dry
There's only one thing I'm conscious of
I only know that I can't go on
Darling here lies love

The end has come
And my heart is numb
It was like a volt from the blue above
I can't believe it but you're gone darling
And here lies love

I only know that I can't go on
Darling for here lies love
