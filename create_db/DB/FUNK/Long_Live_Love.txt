I was tired of choking
So I took your noose off my neck
I got bored of lying face down
So I wouldn't have to see you
I got sick of crawling
So you could be a big man
I got tired of my balls being cut off
'Cause you didn't have none
You had a good run yeah didn't ya babe?
Now it's ashes to ashes and dust to dust

So long live love
I ain't ever given up on it (long live love)
Won't be long until I rise up (long live love)
I ain't ever given up on it (long live love)
Won't be long until I rise up and I'll rise up
So long live love

Long live, long live 
Long live 
Long live, long live, long live love

Gonna wash your dirt off
'Til I'm spankin' clean
'Cause the real deal baby
He's gonna look good on me
I forgive myself
For all the time I wasted on you
If I learned anything baby I learned
What a man ain't to do
You had a good run yeah didn't ya babe?
Now it's ashes to ashes and dust to dust

So long live love
I ain't ever given up on it (long live love)
Won't be long until I rise up (long live love)
I ain't ever given up on it (long live love)
Won't be long until I rise up and I'll rise up
So long live love

Long live love
Long live love
Long live love, long live love

Long live, long live
