I will fight to the end
If it means our love will win
I will do, do my best
Put me to any test
I will fight to the end
If it means our love will win
I will do, do my best
Put me to any test

Baby, I'm with you
Though times get hard, I'll do my part to stay here
Baby, I'm with you
We will survive, keep it alive
Just hold on
Baby, I'm with you
Love is the key, just you and me
I'm ready and willing

I will fight to the end
If it means our love will win
I will do, do my best
Put me to any test
I will fight to the end
If it means our love will win
I will do, do my best
Put me to any test

Baby, I'm with you
Mistakes we'll make; it's give and take
Believe me, baby, I'm with you
Tears in our eyes
Faith will arrive on time
Baby, I'm with you
Forget the past
We'll make it last forever and ever

I will fight (4x)

Baby, I'm with you
Though times get hard, I'll do my part to stay here
Baby, I'm with you
We will survive, keep it alive
Just hold on
Baby, I'm with you
Love is the key, just you and me
I'm ready and willing

I will fight (repeat and fade)
