If we both decide to try and make it one more time
I hope we take the time to know each other well
And if the answers don't come quick we'll go with how it feels
And sometimes that's not 'Yes' or 'No'

But maybe there'll be no falling stars this time around
I still believe that honesty is all we'll ever need
You and me again, maybe

You keep asking me if I will love you for all time
If two of us will be enough to make it strong
And if we learn to keep it free and let each other grow
We'll find out there's no 'Yes' or 'No'

Just maybe there'll be no falling stars this time around
I still believe that honesty is all we'll ever need
Can we make it through? Maybe

No candles or guitar this time around
(This time around)
I still believe that honesty is all we'll ever need
(All we'll need)
You and me again
(Maybe)

(Maybe)
Maybe there'll be no falling stars this time around
(This time around)
I still believe that honesty is all we'll ever need for us
(Can we make it through?)
