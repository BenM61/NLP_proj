Brother and sister,
Tell me how you feelin'.

And I say mother,
Tell me how you feelin'.

Father,
Tell me how you feelin'.

If you can't tell me how you feel,
I may say: There will be no freedom.

One million miles away from home.
One million miles away from love.
One million times away from hope.
One million times away from god.
