I'm gonna stand up straight, hold back my shoulders
I'm gonna paint that smile on my face
When I'm walking out that door, you're the reason
That I've got courage, I've got strength

The truth is I get a little scared now that we're older
The truth is I get a little scared of life without you
You're the one to lift me up if I'm weaker
The truth is I feel like I'm alive when I'm with you

We have grown so fast some days feel like they're stolen
Trying to make our way through dark uncertainties
I want you to understand that I'll be there
Any time you want me to

And the truth is I get a little scared now that we're older
The truth is I get a little scared of life without you
You're the one to lift me up if I'm weaker
And the truth is I feel like I'm alive when I'm with you

I look to you, only you
I look to you, only you
You're my savior, you're my light
You're my reason
I'll stand by you
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

But the truth is I get a little scared now that we're older
And the truth is I get a little scared of life without you
You're the one to lift me up if I'm weaker
And the truth is I feel like I'm alive when I'm with you
