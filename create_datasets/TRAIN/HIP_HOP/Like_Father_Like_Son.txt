Yeah, I'll filthy rich wit quarter keys in the kitchen on 'em
The block is hot, but we still out here gettin' it on 'em
And keep a tool every time we hit these streets
'Cause these n***** act a fool and we'll be quick to put it on 'em

Them tear drops homey we so not
The n**** the f*** wit 'cause we will pop
Forty cal keep it cocked n*** ready to block
Keep the gun, the extra clip homey that's how we rock

And like father like son daddy we don't borrow
We stay on the grind homey 'cause we grind harder
And f***** wit me homey you won't like
You'll be the next T-shirt, we ya hood all night

We got them birds flying out and we allowed them pipes
We do this state to state thing and cheat the price
And Rufus came home and I told him to shave
But he was tellin' me 'bout these p**** n***** back in the 80's, baby

Listen, Birdman put me on when I was just eleven
He was my teacher so I was like f*** the lesson
He was my preacher so I was like f*** the reverend
My mother Cita she said that I was wit the devil

My mother Cita now say that he was sent from Heaven
So I take heed to every single word that he tell me
And I remember what my poppa told me
Remember what my poppa told me, young stunna

Yeah, I'm out here homey pitchin' the game
And yes I do the whole thang, n*** give me my change
Yes, we do them old thangs out the brand new range
Lil' n*** like his father homey doing his thang

We keep the gun for paper, homey aimed and cocked
Every n**** I'm my circle homey ready to pop
We be ridin' drops tops that's just how we rock
And I'll be rollin' in the Phantom through my uptown blocks, ***

Look, Birdman Jr. *** the world pops
And we goin' keep it movin' even if the world stops
Stay strapped and laced like girls socks
Stay dapped and drapped like a birthday cake

Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sippin' on wooey when we thirsty
Ya know, I do believe the money's cursed me
So I pray to God that the devil don't murk me, huh

Lil' Wizzle but you b****** call me first place
And poppa taught me paper chase never skirt chase
I put you n***** in the closet, in the shirt space
You n***** is yellow like Sesame Street's Bert's face

Worst case senario, burial
Two tone Carera like mascara, uh
That G-4 take ya boi where ever
Like father, like son the era, n****
