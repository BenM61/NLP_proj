While I sit in here, a sentimental face stares
And a voice says hi, so
So what you gotta what you gotta disdain.

Walk 25 miles oh

Ulysses

I'm not Ulysses, I'm boy Ulysses
No, but you are now, boy.

So sinister, so sinister,
Last night was wild.
What's a matter there, feeling kinda anxious?
That hot blood, grew cold.
