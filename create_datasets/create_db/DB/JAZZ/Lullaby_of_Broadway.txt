Come along and listen to the lullaby of Broadway,
The hip-hooray and ballyhoo, the lullaby of Broadway.
The rumble of a subway train, the rattle of the taxis,
The daffodils who entertain at Angelo's and Maxie's.

When a Broadway Baby says goodnight, it's early in the morning,
Manhattan babies don't sleep tight until the dawn,
Goodnight, baby, goodnight, milkman's on his way.
Sleep tight, baby, sleep tight, let's call it a day.
Listen to the lullaby of Broadway.
