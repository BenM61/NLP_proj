Under this sun
Look what we have got
And those who haven't
Bad luck

We've been running 'round
Pushing the shopping cart
January 2012
Even in the suburbs of Rome

A brick in a castle a camp for those on the run
Dance as weapons
Release my eyes eyes eyes eyes tell me you
Some other kid is sucking on my thumb
Eyes eyes eyes eyes tell me you
Another kid needs to suck on my thumb

Under the sun
Picking piles of flowers for the flowers' pot
It's all that I've got

On my doorstep
A screaming hand
I'm telling you stories
Trust me

Rewrite history to suit our needs
Open my country
A tooth for an eye eyes eyes eyes tell me you
Some other kid is sucking on my thumb
Eyes eyes eyes eyes tell me you
Another kid needs to suck on my thumb

Border's lies the idea of what's mine
A strange desire
Drawing lines with a ruler, bring the fuel to the fire

Border's lies the idea of what's mine, a strange desire
Drawing lines with a ruler
Bring the fuel to the fire
