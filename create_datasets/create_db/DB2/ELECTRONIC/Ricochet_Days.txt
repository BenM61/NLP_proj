Come on down with me 
I'll show you sights you've never seen 
The end is near for you and for me 

Come inside and feel 
There's so much here and something tells me it's for real 
Hiding behind the walls and windows 
Keeping away from the questions on your tongue 

In a room in a house in a dream 
No one's too sure whose dream it is we're living in 
If it's real, that's a brand new deal 
Ricochet days welcome to reality 

Radio holds your confidences 
You're never quite on your own 
A secret kept in silhouettes 
Something eats you deep inside 

In a room in a house in a dream 
No one's too sure whose dream it is we're living in 
If it's real, that's a brand new deal 
Ricochet days welcome to reality 

The walls move in and cramp your comforts 
Windows aren't for looking through 

Someone calls your name but your name was a stranger to you 
It doesn't matter doesn't matter 
Take me by the hand this is all I can offer you
