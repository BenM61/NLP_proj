Daytime you're to proud to brag
About the badge you wore
Nighttime you're to tired to drive
Your change across the floor
All your guns are gone I'm told
Or in the Aerodrome
Did you die the day they sold
The ones you left at home
Hold my hand in the Android Warehouse
Who's to know if you take a dive
Ain't life grand in the Android Warehouse
What a burner when you take off your goggles and find?
That you're alive
That you're alive
Did you really gobble up
The things they claimed you ate
Were you fit to swallow it
Or scared to clean your plate
Have you tried to calculate
The hours they'd applaud
I would guess it's somewhat less
For just another fraud
Hold my hand in the Android Warehouse
Who's to know if you take a dive
Ain't life grand in the Android Warehouse
What a burner when you take off your goggles and find...
That you're alive
That you're alive
That you're alive...
