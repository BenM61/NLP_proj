There she blows, Jacques Cousteau
Hear her sing so sweet and low
Lull me overboard, out cold
Gathered in and swallowed whole

Yeah do I want to, with all that charm?
Do I want to? Twist my arm
Yeah do I want to, with all that charm?
Do I want to? Twist my arm

You just hit me where I live
I guess it looked quite primitive
What was that supposed to prove?
Throw the calf or he'll throw you

Do I want to, with all that charm?
Do I want to? Twist my arm
Yeah do I want to, with all that charm?
Do I want to? Twist my arm

Sucked in by the victim world
Thirsty as a cultured pearl
Culled and wooed, bitten, chewed
It won't hurt if you don't move

Do I want to, with all that charm?
Do I want to? Twist my arm
Yeah do I want to, with all that charm?
Do I want to? Twist my arm

Yeah musical chairs, double dares, memorized stairs
Shootin' off flares, springtime hares, broken-down mares

Yeah coward phones, big soup stones, prideless loans
Grill sick crows, motel moans and big fat Jones, woo woo

Martyrs don't do much for me
Though I enjoy them vicariously
After you, no! After me
No, I insist! Please, after me

Do I want to? With all that charm?
Do I want you? Twist my arm
Ha, do I want to? With all that charm?
Do I want you? Twist my arm, ah do it
