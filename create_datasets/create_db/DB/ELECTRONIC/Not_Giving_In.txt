Well, it's time to start the show
Lost my heart and lost my soul
Now it's the time that you won't know
Lost my mind and lost my goal

Not giving in
I'm not giving in
Not giving in
I'm not giving in, yeah

This time, I'm gonna be stronger I'm not giving in
This time, I'm gonna be stronger, no, I'm not giving in

Waste my time which makes things worse
Lost in mine, my love is cursed
time to make these things feel right
let's start this show for one last time

Oh, I'm not giving in
(Not giving in) not giving in, (not giving in)
Let me tell you no, not giving in
Not this time (not giving in)
Not gonna give it in

This time, I'm gonna be stronger I'm not giving in
This time, I'm gonna be stronger, no, I'm not giving in

No, not giving in
Not giving in (this time, I'm gonna be stronger I'm not giving in)
I'm gonna be stronger (this time, I'm gonna be stronger I'm not giving in)
I'm gonna be stronger

This time, I'm gonna be stronger I'm not giving in
This time, I'm gonna be stronger I'm not giving in
This time, I'm gonna be stronger I'm not giving in

(I'm gonna be stronger) this time, I'm gonna be stronger I'm not giving in
This time, I'm gonna be stronger I'm not giving in
This time, I'm gonna be stronger I'm not giving in

This time, I'm gonna be stronger I'm not giving in
