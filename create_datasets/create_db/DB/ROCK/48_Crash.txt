Well you got the hands of a man and the face of a little boy blue-ue
And when you stand you're so grand there's a case just for looking at you-oo oo-oo
You're so young, you could have been the devil's son
You're so young, but like a hang up I'll be sad when you're old and you're gone

Watch Out!
You know the 48 Crash come like a lightning flash (48 Crash, 48 Crash)
And the 48 Crash is a silk sash bash (48 Crash, 48 Crash)
48 Crash, 48 Crash
Come like a lightning flash, a lightning flash
And it's a silk sash bash, a silk sash bash, that's the 48 Crash

You've got the kind of a mind of a juvenile Romeo-o
And you're so blind you could find that your motor ain't ready to go-o o-o
You're so young, you're a hot shot son of a gun
You're so young, but like a teenage tearaway soon you'll be torn and you'll run

Watch Out!
You know the 48 Crash come like a lightning flash (48 Crash, 48 Crash)
And the 48 Crash is a silk sash bash (48 Crash, 48 Crash)
48 Crash, 48 Crash
Come like a lightning flash, a lightning flash
And it's a silk sash bash, a silk sash bash, that's the 48 Crash

Crash, Crash, 48 Crash (Crash)
Crash, Crash, 48 Crash (Crash)
Crash, Crash, 48 Crash (Crash)
Crash, Crash, ah!

You know the 48 Crash comes like a lightning flash (48 Crash, 48 Crash)
And the 48 Crash is a silk sash bash (48 Crash, 48 Crash)
48 Crash, 48 Crash
Come like a lightning flash, a lightning flash
And it's a silk sash bash, a silk sash bash
That's the 48 Crash
48 Crash
48 Crash
48 Crash
48 Crash
48 Crash
48 Crash
48 Crash
48 Crash
48 Crash
48 Crash
48 Crash
