All alone at the end of the of the evening
When the bright lights have faded to blue
I was thinking 'bout a man who might have loved me
And I never knew

You know I've always
I've always been a dreamer
Spent my life running 'round
And it's so hard to change
Can't seem to settle down

But the dreams I've seen lately
Keep on turning out and burning out
And turning out the same, same
So put me on a highway
And show, show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time

You can spend all your time, spend all your time making money
Oh and you can spend all, spend all your love making time
But if it all fell to pieces tomorrow
Would you still, would you still be mine?

And when you're looking
When you're looking for your freedom
Nobody seems to care
You can't find the door
Can't find it anywhere

When there's nothing
Nothing to believe in
Still you're running back
You keep coming back
You're running back for more

Put me on a highway
And show me, show me a sign
Take it to the limit one more time

Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit one more time

Take it to the limit
Take it, take it to the limit
Take it to the limit

Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh no
Oh oh
Take it to limit, one more time
