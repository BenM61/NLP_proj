All I can ever be to you
Is a darkness we once knew
And this deep regret I had to get accustomed to
Once it felt so right
Anticipation at its height
Lived and weighed in hotel rooms late at night
I knew I hadn't met my match
But every moment we could snatch
I don't know why I let myself get so attached
It's my responsibility
And you don't owe nothing to me
But to cut myself off, I have no capacity

He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm grown
And in your grey in this cool shade
My tears dry on their own

I don't understand
Why do I stress a man
When there's so many better things at hand
We could a never had it all
We had to hit a wall
And this is inevitable withdrawal
Even if I stop wanting you
A perspective pushes through
I'll be some next man's other woman soon

I cannot play myself again
I should just be my own best friend
Not f*ck myself in the head with stupid men

He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm grown
And in your grey
In this cool shade
My tears dry on their own

Wish I could say no regrets and no emotional debt
And as we kiss goodbye the sun behind you sets
So we are history, your shadow covers me
The sky above, a blaze that only lovers see

He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm grown
And in your grey
In this cool shade
My tears dry on their own

He walks away
The whole sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm grown
Baby, in your grey
In this cool shade
My tears dry on their own

And in your grey (?)
My tears dry on their own
In your grey, in this cool shade
My tears dry on their own 
In your grey, in this cool shade
My tears dry on their own
