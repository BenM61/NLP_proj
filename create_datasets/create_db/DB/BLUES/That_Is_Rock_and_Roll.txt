[Spoken]
In the beginning, there weren't nothin' but rocks.
Then somebody invented the wheel--
And things just started in to roll!

[Sung]
Did you ever hear a tenor sax
Swingin' like a rusty axe?
Honkin' like a frog
Down in a hollow log?
Well, baby, that is rock and roll.

Did you ever hear a guitar twang,
Dingy, dingy, dingy, dang?
Ever hear those strings
Doin' crazy things?
Well, baby, that is rock and roll.

That ain't no freight train that you hear,
Rollin' down the railroad tracks--
That's a country boy piano man
Playin' in between the cracks.

You say that music's for the birds,
And you can't understand the words?
Well, honey, if you did,
You'd really blow your lid,
'Cause, baby, that is rock and roll.

Baby, that is rock and roll. (in the evenin')
Baby, that is rock and roll.
