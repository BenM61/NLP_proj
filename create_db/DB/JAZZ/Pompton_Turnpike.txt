POMPTON TURNPIKE
Charlie Barnet   

Pompton Turnpike, that's 
A very famous Jersey roadway 
Full of country charm.
Pompton Turnpike, leads you 
To a place not far from Broadway,
Still it's on a farm.
You dine with lights subdued,
The music interlude puts you right in the mood
To dance and find yourself romance.
Pompton Turnpike, ride your bike 
Or if you like just hitch hike,
Come to Pompton Turnpike
