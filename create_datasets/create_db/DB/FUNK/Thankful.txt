This song is just a simple little message
There's no heavy thing
It's just a mere reminder for those of us who
Sometimes forget just how good we are

Life is something we pretend to take for granted
We've gotta it so good that we're hard to satisfy
It would be so nice if we lead towards appreciation
It's not hard if just we try

You should tell the child that only has bread and butter
That some folks have no bread at all
And the man that has no fortune
That hasn't still found someone to love
He should stand just as tall

That's why I'm thankful for every morning that I rise
I'm thankful whether God sends rain or blue sky
I'm thankful 'cause I can clearly see
His love for you and me

Hey, looking back through the years when I was very young
I used to dream of becoming a star
Even though I was [Incomprehensible], I was patient because of you
In time I would grow fine

There were many obstacles that were in my way
I could have done bad things and been locked away
But with lot of attention from my family
Success is seen this day

I'm thankful for every morning that I rise
I'm thankful whether God sends rain or blue sky
I'm thankful 'cause I can clearly see
His love for you and me

If we only stop to count our blessings
We'll find that there will be no time to complain
Oh, what we don't have, that's not the best thing
'Cause the most important things in life we can always gain

That's why I'm thankful
Thankful, thankful
His love

That's why I'm thankful for every morning that I rise
I'm thankful whether God sends rain or blue sky
I'm thankful 'cause I can clearly see
His love for you and me

Thankful, thankful
I'm thankful
Thankful 'cause I can really see
His love
