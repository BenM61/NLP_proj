And I, I just wanted you so bad
And I, I just wanted you so bad
I don't know where I'm going
I don't know who to trust anymore
One thing's for sure: that I can't fall asleep without you next to me, babe
Mmm, I'm a mess
Hey, I, hey, I
You know I wanted you bad, baby
Hey
Hey

And I, I just wanted you so bad
Hey, hey
I, I just wanted you so bad
Hey, hey
I, you know I wanted you so bad
You know I want you so bad, bad, bad, bad
Bad, bad, bad
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, hey

Step right up for the grand romantic
Always tragic broken bones
Step right up, it's the grand romantic
Karma, leave these kids alone
Step right up for the grand romantic
Always tragic broken bones
Step right up, it's the grand romantic
Karma, leave these kids alone
I don't wanna live as the grand romantic
Grand romantic anymore
I don't wanna live as the grand romantic
Grand romantic anymore
