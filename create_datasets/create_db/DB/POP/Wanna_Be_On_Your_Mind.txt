Wanna be on your mind
Stay there all the time
You can call my name
Dadadada
Wanna be on your mind
Stay there all the time
You can call my name

Dadadada
Watching light travel
Across your face
As I move my clothes
Into your place
Side by side
Through different doors
Honey, I got my path
And you've got yours

Wanna hypnotize you
With the sweetest sweet
Cause you know your love
Makes me complete
In the darkest hours
Of the brightest days
I wanna be beside you
Each step of the way
