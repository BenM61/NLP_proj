I've got something to say to you
I'll back it up with my fist
Sick and tired of dealing with assholes
That's why I resist

We're not snowflakes
We are the antifa

Right wing is in freefall
Skinheads taking a dive
Antifa is coming for you
They won't survive

We're not snowflakes
We are the antifa

Brown shirt little snowflakes
Never want to admit
Terrified of the red and black flag
Antifa's the shit

We're not snowflakes
We are the antifa
