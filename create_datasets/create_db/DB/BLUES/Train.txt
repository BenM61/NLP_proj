And now the sun has broken through, it looks like it will stay
Just can't have you comin' home on such a rainy day
The train is leaving Ellensville, unless my watch is fast
The kids are comin' home from school, must be quarter past

So many changes since you've been away, and there's so many things to say
This time around you'll want to stay, 'cause I've had so many nights to find the way
Even bought that summer cottage yesterday, pretty soon I'll be close to you
And it will be so good, we'll talk about the part of you I never understood,

And I will take good care of you, and never let you cry
We will look so much in love to people passing by
So many changes since you've been away, and there's so many things to say
I wrote so many times and more, but the letters still are lying in my drawer

'Cause the morning mail had left some time before
All the passengers for Allentown wait closer to the track
It's hard for me to realize you're really coming back
The crossing gate is coming down I think I see the train

The sun has gone and now my face is wet with heavy rain
The passengers for Allentown are gone, the train is slowly moving on
But I can't see you any place, and I know for sure I'd recognize your face
And I know for sure I'd recognize your face.
