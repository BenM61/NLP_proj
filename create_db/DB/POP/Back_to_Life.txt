‘Cause I'm bringing you back to life

Our love's enough
Transcending us through space and time
It's holding up
It keeps you and me intertwined

What's a pipe dream if you ain't trying to do it?
What's a heartbreak if you ain't crying all through it?
What's a sunset if you ain't riding into it?
Let's drive into it

‘Cause I'm bringing you back to life (back)
And I know that you're gone, but I swear that you're here
It's a feeling that won't disappear
And you're bringing me back to life (back)
I was looking for something that I couldn't find
It's a feeling you give me inside

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
‘Cause I'm bringing you back to life
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
This feeling's coming back to life

Our memories
They're more than just our history (our history)
They lift me up
They flow like electricity (oh, oh, oh)

What's a pipe dream if you ain't trying to do it?
What's a heartbreak if you ain't crying all through it?
What's a sunset if you ain't riding into it?
Let's drive into it

‘Cause I'm bringing you back to life (back)
And I know that you're gone but I swear that you're here
It's a feeling that won't disappear
And you're bringing me back to life (back)
I was looking for something that I couldn't find
It's a feeling you give me inside

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
‘Cause I'm bringing you back to life
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I can see you in the night
Coming through like flashing lights
When the world is passing by
Oh, oh, oh
I can see you in the night
Coming through like flashing lights
When the world is passing by
Oh, oh, oh (oh)

‘Cause I'm bringing you back to life (back)
And I know that you're gone but I swear that you're here
It's a feeling that won't disappear
And you're bringing me back to life (back)
I was looking for something that I couldn't find
It's a feeling you give me inside
'Cause I'm bringing you back
'Cause I'm bringing you back
'Cause I'm bringing you back to life
'Cause I'm bringing you back to life
And you're bringing me back
And you're bringing me back
And you're bringing me back to life
This feeling's coming back to life

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
‘Cause I'm bringing you back to life
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
This feeling's coming back to life
