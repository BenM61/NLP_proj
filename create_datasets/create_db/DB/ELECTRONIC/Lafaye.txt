You broke into the fabric house of stranger Lafaye
And there your heart was taken from you
You have the blood of intuition
With a name that branded you
And the familiar, unfamiliar
Would be the only thing you knew

Lafaye, la laa, Lafaye
Lafaye, la laa, Lafaye

Your birth became a place to sing and relive again
And every death a love to choose
A one to lose
You are a chain of indecision
Into a cloud that followed you
And with a with no measure
You brought a sun to guide you through

Lafaye, la laa, Lafaye
Lafaye, la laa, Lafaye

Oh

Lafaye, la laa, Lafaye
Lafaye, la laa, Lafaye
