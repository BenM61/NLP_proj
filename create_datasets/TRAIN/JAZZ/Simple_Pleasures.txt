you don't have to be so strong
don't move mountains for me
don't slay a dragon
every time you run back here
you are more than a knight in shining armour
who would need a prince...
anyway i don't believe in fairy tales
let's leave them for the dreamers
there is something much more real i'm after--
 
simple pleasures--bliss i finally found
in ordinary home-made treasures
on familiar ground
when i'm with you--the time's so precious
hours flying past
we've got to take some long-term measures
so simple joy is here to last
 
don't go yet...
i'll be missing your smile,
your gentle voice, so soothing...
very night and day i will long for the warmth
of your embrace
so who would need a prince
anyway i don't believe in fairy tales
let's leave them for the dreamers
there is something much more real i'm after--
