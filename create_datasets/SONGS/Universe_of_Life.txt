We can't disguise
When our faces show the fear that is inside
There's no surprises, no excuses
Just the body flows

All the lies
And a mono sound that is waking up the dead
Pulling thoughts from side to side
Like a puppet show hand

Open hands
See the fires burn when the sun gets low
Sending shockwaves through our bodies
To the ground below

Seeing is, believin', no there's nothing at all
Don't be fooled by foolish minds
Maybe there's a reason at the life that we hold
In this universe of life

Open hands
Now up high to a sky that is glowing red
Shed with smiling in our memories
Than thoughts instead

Save inside
In our beds as our routine slides away
On the ice there's a hole that we're heading for
And the fish have dragon heads

Seeing is, believin', no there's nothing at all
Don't be fooled by foolish minds
Maybe there's a reason at the life that we hold
In this universe of life

We will go (we will go) to the end
The stars above the sky is now below
We will find (we will find) inner strength
Wave goodbye to soul we used to know

Open hands
See the fires burn when the sun gets low
Sending shockwaves through our bodies
To the ground below

In this universe of life

Maybe there's a reason at the life that we hold
Don't be fooled by foolish minds
Seeing is, believin', no there's nothing at all
In this universe of life

(Life, life)
