Oh young lions
This is your kingdom
Every beast has its poison
Every lion has its victim

Choose your crime
Pour the ashes out the window
Empty mickey by the river
Shattered like a broken arrow

Oh young lions
This is your kingdom
Roll out a cradle
Climb out the window

Make your now
Too wild for words
Stumblin' through the city
With the ordinary bird

Choose your crime 
Pour the ashes out the window
Empty mickey by the river
Shattered like a broken arrow

Loosen up the collar
Shake of the wire
Run like a river
Glow like a beacon fire
