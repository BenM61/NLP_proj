Last night before you fell asleep
You whispered something to me
Was it just a dream
I'm gonna listen to you close
Coz your goodnight kiss
Felt like a ghost

What are you trying to say to me
What are you trying to say

Everybody's searching for initmacy
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Everybody's hurting for initmacy
Ooh ooh ooh ooh 

We come into this world alone
From the heart of darkness
The infinite unknown
We're only herre a little while
And I feel safe and warm
When I see you smile

Baby don't move away from me
Baby don't pull away
  
Everybody's searching for initmacy
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Everybody's hurting for initmacy
Ooh ooh ooh ooh 

Remember when you were a child
And your momma would hold you in her arms
And rock you to sleep
Now darling theres just you and I
Let's give each other everything baby baby...

Everybody's searching for intimacy
Ooh ooh ooh ooh 
Everybody's hurting for intimacy
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Baby come around and lay down next to me...
