Let me love you tonight, let me tell you how much I adore all your charms,
Though you leave me tomorrow, for this night we'll borrow a love song.
Let me love you tonight, let me thrill to the touch of your sheltering arms,
Till the scent of the roses, caresses the sky and closes your eyes.
Let me kiss you tonight, while the stars in the sky give a heavenly light,
So, love is an ember, my heart will remember your sighs,
Live a lifetime of love in a moment like this,
Darling, let me love you tonight.
