Your construction
Smells of corruption
I manipulate to recreate
This air to ground saga
Gotta launder my karma 

I said hallelujah to the sixteen loyal fans
You'll get down on your mothafuckin' knees
And it's time for your sickness again
Come on and tell me what you need
Tell me what is making you bleed
We got two more minutes and 
We gonna cut to what you need
So one of six so tell me
One do you want to live
And one of seven tell me
Is it time for your mothafuckin' ass to give
Tell me is it time to get down on your mothafuckin' knees
Tell me is it time to get down 

I'm blown to the maxim
Two hemispheres battlin'
I'm blown to the maxim
Two hemispheres battlin'
Suckin' up, one last breath
Take a drag off of death 

Hey Mr. Policeman
Is it time for getting away
Is it time for driving down the mother fuckin' road
And running from your ass today
Now tell me if do you agree
Or tell me if I'm makin' you bleed 
I got a few more minutes and 
I'm gonna cut to what you need
So one of six so tell me
One do you want to live
And one of seven tell me
Is it time for your mothafuckin' ass to give
Tell me is it time to get down on your mothafuckin' knees
Tell me is it time to get down 

Got a revolution behind my eyes
We got to get up and organize
Got a revolution behind my eyes
We got to get up and organize
Got a revolution behind my eyes
We got to get up and organize
You want a revolution behind your eyes
We got to get up and organize 

Come on baby tell me 
Yes we aim to please
