'm soaring the sky, I can hear the birds
And man they don't lie
How you gonna catch me, When I'm this high

I'm moving on
I got the words to a brand new song
How you gonna catch me, when I'm this gone

Gone tomorrow here today
Just in case you got somethin' to say
I'll be leaving with the rest if goodbye
Is all we have

I disconnected the phone
Told the neighbors I'll be heading home
As soon as the light hits the morn

I'm heading north
Gonna see what this heart's really worth
I guess it's time to be on my own

Gone tomorrow here today
Just in case you got somethin' to say
I'll be leaving with the rest if goodbye
Is all we have
Gone tomorrow here today
Just in case you got somethin' to say
I'll be leaving with the rest if goodbye
Is all we have

I sure would love to see you tonight
Maybe try to end this fight
If I don't hear you knockin on my door
Then I'll know for sure

Gone tomorrow here today
Just in case you got somethin' to say
I'll be leaving with the rest if goodbye
Is all we have
Gone tomorrow here today
Just in case you got somethin' to say
I'll be leaving with the rest if goodbye
Is all

Gone tomorrow here today
Just in case you got somethin' to say
I'll be leaving with the rest if goodbye
Is all we have
Gone tomorrow here today
I'll be leaving with the rest if goodbye
Is all we have
