I remember when we used to stay up all night long
We would never have thought we've be in the wrong
Spending hours never really doing anything
We could hear each other without a word

Is there another feeling in between?
Is there another feeling in between?

I've always been wandering how we could change so fast
Did it really happen in the past?
Once you told me there was nothing better than a friend
I would easily believe in a friend

Is there another feeling in between?
Is there another feeling in between?

Now I have to clear myself in front of everyone
But I'm not really sure what I've done
It seems like you're trying to choose between love and hate
While I keep asking to myself

Is there another feeling in between?
Is there another feeling in between?
