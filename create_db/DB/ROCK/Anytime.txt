Blow a kiss from your hand,
I'll catch it 'fore it hits the ground
Cry a little for our fears.. Baby... Baby
I'm so scared there's something wrong
I hid you in the corner of my empty room,
Never really cared 'til now, not standin in the
Corner for me anymore, you done your time
Pass your sentence an' I'll pass mine
But when my time is through can I still come 
Home to you

Anytime, anytime you want me,
Anytime, anytime your lonely
You just have to call ''cause you
Know I'll be there... Oh...
Anytime, anytime you need me
Anytime, anytime maybe you're dreamin'
Waking up all alone, you're heart is screaming
Oh...

I know I caused you so much pain,
I promise that I'll never hurt you again
Even tho the scars remain
With a little time I know we can win
Can't stop this fire, lost control over my desire
Still it burns for you like it always used to do

Anytime, anytime you want me,
Anytime, anytime your lonely
You just have to call ''cause you
Know I'll be there... Oh...
Anytime, anytime you need me
Anytime, anytime maybe you're dreamin'
Waking up all alone, you're heart is screaming
Oh...

And after the war is over 
And all the fighting is through
Can I make my peace with you? 
I want to come home to you

Anytime, anytime you want me,
Anytime, anytime your lonely
You just have to call ''cause I'm
Always there... Yeah...
Anytime, anytime you need me
Anytime, anytime maybe you're dreamin'
Waking up all alone, you're heart is screaming
Oh...

Anytime, anytime you want me,
Oh so lonely... so lonely...
But you know I care... Yeah...
Anytime, anytime do you need me 
Anytime, anytime oh are ya dreamin'

Waking up all alone, you're heart is screaming
Oh...
