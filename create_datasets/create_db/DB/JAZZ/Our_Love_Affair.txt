Our love affair was meant to be
It's me for you dear, and you for me
We'll fuss, we'll quarrel and tears start to brew
But after the tears our love will smile through
I'm sure that I could never hide
The thrill I get when you're by my side
And when we're older we'll proudly declare
Wasn't ours a lovely love affair
