She shadows me in the mirror
She never leaves on the light
And some things that I say to her
They just don't seem to bite
It's all mixed up
It's all mixed up
It's all mixed up

She tricks me into thinkin'
I can't believe my eyes
I wait for her forever
But she never does arrive
It's all mixed up
It's all mixed up
It's all mixed up

She says to leave it to me
(Leave it to me)
Everything'll be alright
(be alright)
She says to leave it to me
(Leave it to me)
Everything'll be alright

She's always out makin' pictures
She's always out makin' scenes
She's always out the window
When it comes to makin' dreams
It's all mixed up
It's all mixed up
It's all mixed up

She says to leave it to me
(Leave it to me)
Everything'll be alright
(Be alright)
She says to leave it to me
(Leave it to me)
Everything'll be alright
(Be alright)
She says to leave it to me
(Leave it to me)
Everything'll be alright
(Be alright)
She says to leave it to me, yeah
(Leave it to me)
Everything'll be alright
(Be alright)
If you leave it to me
(Leave it to me)
Everything'll be alright
(Be alright)
Yeah, if you leave it to me
(Leave it to me)
(Be alright)
(Be alright)
(Be alright)
(Be alright)
