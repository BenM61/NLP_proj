Like I always say, what's good for the geese
Is always good for the gander
Oh, Sheila

Oh, baby love me right
Let me love you till I get it right
Can't you let the others be
'Cause with you is where I got to be, yeah

Oh, sugar where you been
Hangin' out with your male friends
Listen, somebody's going to hurt you
The way you love, to keep hurting me
And we sing

Oh, oh, Sheila let me love you till the morning comes
Oh, oh, Sheila you know I want to be the only one

Oh baby, understand that I want to be the only man
But it seems as though it's getting too hard
And I think I'll start to have my own friend

Oh baby, it's plain to see
That you're qualified to fulfill your needs
You think you pulled one over on me
Well honey, baby, just you wait and see
And we sing

Oh, oh, Sheila let me love you till the morning comes (just tryin' to say)
Oh, oh, Sheila you know I want to be the only one (for her)

Oh, baby, it's one two three
I love you baby honestly, 
I want to di a di da li, a di a di da li

Oh, oh, Sheila
Oh, Sheila
Oh, oh, Sheila
Oh, Sheila

Oh, baby, love me right
Let me love you till we get it right
Can't you let the others be
'Cause with you is where I got to be, yeah

Oh, baby understand
That I want to be the only man
You think you pulled one over on me
(Well, honey, baby, just you wait and see)
(And we sing)

Oh

Oh, oh Sheila
Let me love you till the morning comes (just wanna say)
Oh, oh, Sheila
You know I want to be the only one

Oh, oh Sheila
Let me love you till the morning comes 
Oh, oh, Sheila
You know I want to be the only one

(Here we go, oh)
