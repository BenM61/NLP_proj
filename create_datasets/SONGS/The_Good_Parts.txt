I'm sorry if I seem impatient
I'm not a fan of pleasantries
See, I get bored with the weather and what's in the news
The topics we all hide beneath

Could not care less about your day job
The gossip or ordinary stress
See, every relationship I've ever loved
It starts when someone says

Show me where it hurts and give me something real
And lead me to the part of you that never really heals
And say the words that burn when they leave your mouth
Tell me your story, but don't leave the good parts out

And tell me all about your failures
The little things that make you cry
And tell me the acts that you preach but cannot seem to practice
That leave you compromised

Show me where it hurts and give me something real
And lead me to the part of you that never really heals
And say the words that burn when they leave your mouth
Tell me your story, but don't leave the good parts out

I've seen your trophies, your highlight reels
You know I would love you still if you lost it all
And I love the castle that you have built
But I am asking still to let down the walls

Show me where it hurts and give me something real
And lead me to the part of you that never really heals
And say the words that burn when they leave your mouth
Tell me your story
And show me where it hurts, yeah
Oh, to the part of you that never really heals
And show me where it hurts, woah
Tell me your story
But don't leave the good parts out
Don't leave the good parts out
