Let us take a walk in the city lights
'Cause this night is right and time is tight.
Come and take my hand
put your cigarette out

I would like to know all about you.
A few blocks from here is a boulevard
Where we can find a late night cafe.
We got everything to win when the night closes in.

Let me dry your tears
I know what you've been through

But baby feel no fear
I've been through it too.
So just take my hand take a chance on me

This night belongs to us - you and me.
A few blocks from here is a boulevard...
We got everything to win when the night closes in.
When the night closes in - when the night closes in.
