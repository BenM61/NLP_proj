Send me shivers down
Through a voice out of nowhere
When the boats go round
Turn on back to a spiral

Send me shivers down
When the boats go round
Turn on back to a spiral

Send me shivers down
Through a voice out of nowhere
When the boats go round
Tun on back to a spiral

Turn back
Turn 
Turn
Turn
Turn

Send me shivers down
When the boats go round
Turn on back to a spiral

Turn back
Turn 
Turn
Turn
Turn

Send me shivers down
Through a voice out of nowhere
When the boats go round
Turn on back to a spiral

Send me shivers down
When the boats go round
Turn on back to a spiral

Send me shivers down
Through a voice out of nowhere
When the boats go round
Turn on back to a spiral
