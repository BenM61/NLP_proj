If your child ain't all he should be 
This girl will put him right
I'll show him what he could be now
If Just give me one night

'Cause I'm the gypsy, I'm the acid queen
Pay me before I start
I'm the gypsy and I'm guaranteed
To tear your sould apart

Give us a room, close the door
Leave us for a while
You won't be a boy no more
You be young, but not a child

'Cause I'm the gypsy I'm the acid queen
Pay me before I start
Say, I'm the gypsy, I'm guaranteed
To mend his aching heart

Gather your wits and hold them fast
Your mind gotta learn to roam
Just as the gypsy queen must do
You're gonna hit the road

'Cause I'm the gypsy, I'm the acid queen
Pay me before I start
I'm the gypsy, I'm guaranteed
To tear your sould apart

I'm the gypsy, I'm the acid queen
You gotta pay me before I start
I'm the gypsy, I'm guaranteed
To tear your sould apart

I'm the gypsy, I'm the acid queen
You gotta pay me before I start
I'm the gypsy, I'm guaranteed
To mend his aching heart
