It's Christmas
It's always the same at every Christmas
When Lord comes alive around the world
We open up our hearts
When love is in the air
It seems such a shame to May
It's a season that comes only once a year

So let's make the Christmas wish together
It's like the best of dreams come true
Let's make the spirit last forever
This is my Christmas wish for you

My wish for you
If I could give any gift I wanted
A present to every boy and girl
I'd make it a miracle that came from God above
A picture of peace under
Where each person is touched by the power of love

Let's make the Christmas wish together
It's like the best of dreams come true
Let's make the spirit last forever
This is my Christmas wish

For you
It's seems such a shame to May
It's a season that comes only once a year

So let's make the Christmas wish together
It's like the best of dreams come true
Let's make the spirit last forever
This is my Christmas wish for you

So let's make the Christmas wish together
It's like the best of dreams come true
Let's make the spirit last forever
This is my Christmas wish for you

This is the Christmas wish I pray for you
