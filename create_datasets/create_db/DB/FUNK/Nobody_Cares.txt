Nobody knows (nobody knows)
Nobody cares (nobody cares)
When the tears fall from my eyes
Do you think anyone would stop
And ask me the reason why

No, because nobody
Nobody cares about me

Nobody knows (nobody knows)
Nobody cares (nobody cares)
When I am sitting all alone
Do you think anyone would
Call me on the telephone

No, because nobody
Nobody cares about me

Yes, I used to have many lovers
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah
They have gone and
Found themselves others

Now I'm alone
Just as lonely as can be

Nobody knows (nobody knows)
Nobody cares (nobody cares)
When the tears fall from my eyes
Do you think anyone would stop
And ask me the reason why

No, because nobody
Nobody cares about me
