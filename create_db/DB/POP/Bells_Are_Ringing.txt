All around, there's the sound of the midsummers night
Bells in the air are ringing everywhere
I can hear footsteps that pass on the street
And lovers rushing to meet
Here alone I can only imagine the sight
Me on the town, in some bewitching gown
But I just wait at the end of the line
As bells are ringing, the bells keep ringing
Oh why, oh why can't the next call be mine

Thank you, thank you, thank you Susanswerphone, Ah-ahhh!
