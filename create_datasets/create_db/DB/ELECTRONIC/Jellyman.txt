He's the middle man
Stole my heart
But he was the master

Oh no no
Now knee deep in yearning
The bastard kept me waiting
Around like a dumb dumb
I see you, what
But I won't learn
I see you

He's a little thief
Stole my heart
But he was faster
Than I've ever known
Now I'm like a zombie
Go where he goes
He could bounce me like a yo-yo
Around like a boomerang
He didn't think of that one
Look, here he comes around
I'd better run

[Chorus:]
Jellyman, jellyman
You know you're messin' with a Jezebel
I won't bounce you like a yo-yo
Jellyman, jellyman
You know you're messin' with a Jezebel
I won't bounce you like a yo-yo around an around

He was some petty thief, caught my eye
An I'm in a fix now
Oh no he won't see me, I'm no one
Just another one to make goo goo eyes like a dumb dumb
Not a string along, no
I'm the only one
He'll come around

I don't want no jellyman jammin' up my can can
I'm with my mister, ah yes I am
Now he has to follow, go where I go
I can bounce him like a yo-yo
Around like a boomerang
He didn't think of that one, no
When he came around, I didn't run

[Chorus:]

I see you on
I see you on
I see you on

I see you jellyman, jellyman
See you
See you jellyman, jellyman 
See you 
See you jellyman, jellyman

[Chorus:]
