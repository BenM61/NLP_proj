Black Power, girl power, rack and ruin
Blackmail, ponytail, something doin'
Something pulls me over
Pulls me through to you

Walking downstairs sideways
Vodka, sonic proof
Screaming murder always
And trying to catch it

Trying to catch it
Trying to catch it

And bring me the head of the fortune teller
It wasn't meant to be this way
It weren't meant to work out this way
So bring me the head of the fortune teller
I'm gonna wear it 'round my neck as a charm
When I feel lucky I'm gonna chance my arm

Sure-fire, backfire, golden shoes
See-through, fall through, nothin' to lose
You say you feel fine now
Until the end of time

One night when we're screamin'
Loathe to find a way
These days when we're scheming
And trying to catch it

Trying to catch it
Trying to catch it

And bring me the head of the fortune teller
It wasn't meant to be this way
It weren't meant to work out this way
So bring me the head of the fortune teller

I'm gonna wear it 'round my neck as a charm
When I feel luck I'm gonna chance my arm
Chance my arm

Black power, gay power, black and blue
Blackmail and tall tales, try something new
You say you'll feel fine now
It pulls me through to you

One night when we're screamin'
Vodka, sonic proof
Walking downstairs sideways
And trying to catch it

Trying to catch it
Trying to catch it

And bring me the head of the fortune teller
It wasn't meant to be this way
It weren't meant to work out this way
So bring me the head of the fortune teller

I'm gonna wear it 'round my neck as a charm
When I feel lucky I'm gonna chance my arm
