Will you surrender? Restless in a war, war
We're sailling, farewell love
We praise our shared destiny
Be sure to embrace the dreams
I'm more than a dead and gone

Close your eyes

I see the past of the time passing fast
The present's over and gone
So know I'm ready, I trust my soul
I'm hoping to fly with style, we shall know

Trust in me and set me free
You're hiding your love
I don't wish to try this alone
I feel lone, why shouldn't I go?
'Cause even the time we're so longing gets blown
I feel I tried
I feel so alone
One day we'll say it to the glow
I dream so too

The dreams turn alive, in the heavens

When we surrender, restless in a war, war
