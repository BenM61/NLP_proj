Well now I'm in love with a fast moving angel
Dresses like the city girls do
When we're apart there's no ache in my heart
When we're together we're a hell of a crew 

[Chorus]
And I got presents to send you
Even got money to lend you
But honey I could never ever pretend
Your not there on my mind 

There sits a fifth of tequila
God I swore I'd never drink it again
But my last little bout
I had my hair pulled out by a man
Who wasn't really my friend
And I know I'll never see him again 

[Chorus]

Thought I might sail down to Bridgetown
Spend some time in the Barbados sun
But my plans took a skid when I smoked the whole lid
And wound up where I'd begun 

Yes and

[Chorus]
