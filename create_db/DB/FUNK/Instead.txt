Verse 1:
I saw him shaking his change in a coffee cup
Asked for a dollar but I told the man to give it up
Said he's hungry, I don't think that it's true
Bet my dollar he gon' spend it on booze
I turned my back on him and began to walk away
But then I heard the little voice inside me say
What if it's really true, what if he's hungry?
What if it's not for him, does he have a family?

Pre-chorus:
How'd you get here?
How'd you end up on the street?
Where did it go wrong?
Wonder what I'd do if it were me!

A new point of view
A walk in your shoes
I wish I could get inside your head
To see what you see
When you look at me
'Cause I could've lived your life instead

Verse 2:
It was 90 degrees in the summer heat
She was veiled in black all the way down to her feet
This is America, doesn't she know?
Somebody take her shopping, buy her some cloths
She came up to me, I didn't understand a word
I was about to leave then another thought occurred
She might be really lost, scared and frustrated
I should try again to see what she's sayin'

Pre-chorus 2:
How'd you get here?
How'd you get so far from home?
What was it that made you leave?
Wonder what I'd do if it were me!

A new point of view
A walk in your shoes
I wish I could get inside your head
To see what you see
When you look at me
'Cause I could've lived your life instead

I would see, oh oh
Oh, see what you see
And I would feel
Oh, feel just what you feel

Chorus (x2)

'Cause I could've lived your life instead (x2)
