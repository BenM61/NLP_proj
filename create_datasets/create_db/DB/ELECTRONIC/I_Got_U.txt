I spent it with you
If I lose my fame and fortune
Really don't matter
As long as I got you, baby

Clap your hands, drop so right
Clap your hands, drop so right
Clap your hands, drop so right
As long as I got you, baby
Clap your hands, drop so right
Clap your hands, drop so right
Clap your hands, drop so right
As long as I got you
