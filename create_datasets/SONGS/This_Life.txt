
(You couldn't even bring yourself)
to stay, oh no
You had to go spoil it all
I know you had to go
Now I find these endlessly, colourblind days to fill
... you never will

(take this life)
Take this life
Take it all in your hands
You are mine
I could smile
again

I dream you come to me ( come back to me )
and comfort me and now
I dream
Where did the time go?
Where did the time go?
did live go?

I know you had to go spoil it all
and now I know
you never will

take this life
take it all in your hands
you are mine
I could smile
again

Just what you said was cold advice
I discovered sticks go with knives
I discovered I could have died in your chain
still I feel, so won't you stay?
