Dynabeat, you better keep it grooving
Dynabeat all the night
Dynabeat, you better keep on dancing
Dancing, now all the night
Dynabeat, you better keep it grooving
Dynabeat all the night
Dynabeat, you better keep on dancing
Dancing, now all the night

Tick-tock time, tryna get the tempo
Music is my way to make it all go
Tick-tock time, tryna get the tempo
Music is my way to make it all go
I can't stop the clocks
But I can make a rhythm out of it
We are lit by the rhythm
And the heartbeats flow
Like it's in your dreams
You feel the need to move

Dynabeat, you better keep it grooving
Dynabeat all the night
Dynabeat, you better keep on dancing
Dancing, now all the night
Dynabeat, you better keep it grooving
Dynabeat all the night
Dynabeat, you better keep on dancing
Dancing, now all the night

All for one and one for all
We raise our hands to push away the dawn
All for one and one for all
We raise our hands to push away the dawn
Welcomes to night
The demons we fly
Love it or hate it
But you have no other choice
You have to realise
That we are all living on a beat

Dynabeat, you better keep it grooving
Dynabeat all the night
Dynabeat, you better keep on dancing
Dancing, now all the night
Dynabeat, you better keep it grooving
Dynabeat all the night
Dynabeat, you better keep on dancing
Dancing, now all the night
Dynabeat, you better keep it grooving
Dynabeat all the night
Dynabeat, you better keep on dancing
Dancing, now all the night
Dynabeat, you better keep it grooving
Dynabeat all the night
Dynabeat, you better keep on dancing
Dancing, now all the night

Dynabeat all the night
Dancing, now all the night
Dynabeat all the night
Dancing, now all the night
Dynabeat all the night
Dancing, now all the night
Dynabeat all the night
Dancing, now all the night
