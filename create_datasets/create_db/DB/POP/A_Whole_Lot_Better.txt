Take a seat, 'cause there's something I wanna say
Take it easy, don't take it the wrong way
I feel a whole lot better when you're not around
I feel a whole lot better
I feel a whole lot better
When you're not around

In and out of love
In and out of love
In and out of love
In and out of love

I change my mind every time that the wind blows
Don't know what happens, don't know where the time goes
I feel a whole lot better when you come around
I feel a whole lot better
I feel a whole lot better
I feel a whole lot better when you come around

I fell in love with you, and out of love with you, and back in love with you, all in the same day
I fell in love with you, and out of love with you, and back in love with you, all in the same day
I fell in love with you, and out of love with you, and back in love with you, all in the same day
I fell in love with you, and out of love with you, and back in love with you, all in the same day

I fell in love with you, and out of love with you, and back in love with you, all in the same day
I fell in love with you, and out of love with you, and back in love with you, all in the same day
I fell in love with you, and out of love with you, and back in love with you, all in the same day
I fell in love with you, and out of love with you, and back in love with you, all in the same day

I feel a whole lot better when you come around
I feel a whole lot better
I feel a whole lot better
I feel a whole lot better when you come around
