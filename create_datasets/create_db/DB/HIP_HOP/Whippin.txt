Don't hit me past one 'cause I might come
Pop a yellow bus, now I'm goin' dumb
If it's past two, I can't look at you (f*ck it)
But I will 'cause you're too true
Too real for the waters, how you make me puke
No-no-no, hey, I still f*ck with you
It's good luck, when I'm like, "Oh, what's up with you?"
Wrist, wrist, wrist, whippin' in the car with you

Whippin' in the car with you, you, you
Whippin' in the car with you, you, you
Whippin' in the car with you, you, you
Whippin' in the car with you, you, you
Wh-whippin', whippin'
Whippin', whippin', whippin'
Whippin'
Whippin', whippin'
Whippin'
Whippin', whippin', whippin' in the car with you
Whippin' in the car with you
Whippin' in the car with you, you, you
Whippin' in the car with you, you, you
Whippin' in the car with you, you, you
Whippin' in the car with you, you, you

Phone lit, past three, see you say "what's up?"
Fuckboy, thought I told you not to hit me up
I got a problem and it sucks, boy
O.T., I'm in love with the fuckboys
I'm just bein' real, can I keep it real?
Way too many feels, way too many feels
Chanel bag, cop it, I don't fuckin' want it
I don't need that bullshit in your wallet

Whippin' in the car with you, you, you
Whippin' in the car with you, you, you
Whippin' in the car with you, you, you
Whippin' in the car with you, you
Whippin', whippin'
Whippin', whippin', whippin'
Whippin', whippin'
Whippin', whippin'
Whippin' whippin', whippin' in the car with you
Whippin' in the car with you
Whippin' in the car with you, you, you
Whippin' in the car with you, you, you
Whippin', whippin' in the car with you, you, you
Whippin' in the car with you, you, you
Whippin', whippin' in the car with you, you, you
Whippin' in the car with you, you, you
Whippin' in the car with you, you, you
Whippin', whippin' in the car with you, you, you

Whippin' in the car with you, you, you
You, you, you, you
