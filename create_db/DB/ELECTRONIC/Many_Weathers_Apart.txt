It's raining now
I couldn't be more soaked up in you
'Cause I conduce
That you're in my heart
Although we are
Many weathers apart

Cloud came by
I'm overshadowed by you
While I conduce
That you're in my heart
Yet we are
Many weathers part

Like cumulo-nimbus
Your memory lingers
Drifting my thoughts afar
I sit in my car
The way we are
Many weathers apart

I can see there's a little rain
I can see sunbeam again
I'm alive
I was hopelessly dead
I'm achieve
Achieve what I said
That's my line

The sun is out
It shines an people like you
All the ones I knew
They're in my heart
Although we are
Many weathers apart
