If I was listening
And knew I shouldn't be
Made all the threats again
The pain is deafening

The jury couldn't win
And put the verdict in
Like many times before
They closed the coffin door

Leave it all if you had it before
Turn it out if you wanted it more

If it was all wrong the first time
It's the last time
If I was born unbelieving
Unbelieving

He tried to be defined
And all the children whined
It killed the last of them
The King would fall again

Leave it all if you had it before
Turn it out if you wanted it more

If it was all wrong the first time
It's the last time
If I was born unbelieving
Unbelieving
