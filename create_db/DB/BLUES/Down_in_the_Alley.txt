I met a man, asked me did I want to pally 
Yes, baby, let's go down in the alley 
Take me down in the alley 
Take me down in the alley

I met another man, asked me for a dollar 
Might have heard that mother fucker holler 
Let's go down in the alley

When he got me in the alley, he called me a name 
What I put on him was a crying shame 
Down in this alley

Where I got my business fixed all right 
You got me in the alley, but don't get rough 
I ain't gonna put up with that doggone stuff 
Way down in the alley

Can't see no light 
Got to feel my way out this alley

You took me in the alley, you knocked me down

Walking late at night
