How long, baby how long,
Has that evening train been gone?

[Chorus:]
How long,
How how long,
Baby how long?

Went to the station, didn't see no train.
Down in my heart, I have an aching pain.

[Chorus]

I feel disgusted, I feel so bad
Thinking 'bout the good time that I once have had.

[Chorus]

I could see the green grass growing on the hill;
I ain't seen no greenback on a dollar bill.

[Chorus]

You're gonna be sorry, you'll feel so blue.
When you want me, baby, I declare I won't want you.

[Chorus]

Don't have no money for to ride the train.
I would ride the rods, baby, to be with you again.

[Chorus]

How long, baby how long
Must I keep my, my watch in pawn?

[Chorus]
