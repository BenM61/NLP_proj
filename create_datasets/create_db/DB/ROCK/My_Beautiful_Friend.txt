My Beautiful Friend
I will pay attention, don't say this is the end
I find it hard to describe you
To point and discover you
Could I tell you once again

Oh my beautiful friend
Let me sleep and I will feed you when your hungry
Forever live inside of me
Through the holes in the pockets of my clothes
High, as high as an angel
I will stand there beside you
Love is all we need

Oh my beautiful friend
Oh my beautiful friend

I swear I adore you
Ain't no woman deep enough
I don't know how we made it this far dear
Without losing at least an ear
I could leave us, I could leave us a painting
Our lives are-a-changing

I couldn't and I wouldn't want to change you
Don't you know it, I can save you
I will do all of this on my very own
My Beautiful Friend
My beautiful Friend

Do you ever get this feeling
When it's hard to carry on
