And I am living
Without the love of Jesus in my eyes
But it's easier to swallow than collide
The way above the lows and sold your highs

When suddenly they strip it when you try

I still don't get the joke but nevermind
All hype, All height

But you're gonna fall down
Yeah you're gonna fall down
And you're gonna be wound
And you're gonna see

That I am leaving
The light of baby Jesus far behind
For one with history leaking from her eyes
As always things get tense when things are taught
Twisted and distort

But you're gonna fall down
Yeah you're gonna fall down
And you're gonna be wound
And you're gonna see

And on for heavens sake
I needed you today
And never having been
The countryside's obscene

I understood the part
But only only one
You've given up the choice
Why don't she dig my voice

And I believe in
The biggest touted answer to the lie
But always when it's caught you in the eyes
'Cause otherwise it is that I don't mind
It's all hype
It's all height
