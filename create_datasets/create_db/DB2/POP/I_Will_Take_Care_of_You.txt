On a September afternoon, in nineteen-sixty-one,
A little girl's first criy rang out - a new life had begun
Her mother rocked her in her arms, and she kissed her tiny brow
She said "Darling I'm just as scared as you, I promise you somehow."

I will take care of you
The very best that I can
With all of the love here in my heart
And all of the strength in my hands
Your every joy I'll share
For every tear I'll be there my whole life through
I will take care of you

On a September afternoon in nineteen-eighty-five
That little girl had grown into a beautiful young bride
And she turned to the man who held her hand
In front of the wedding crowd
They smiled at each other as they spoke,
And this was their wedding vow

I will take care of you
The very best that I can
With all of the love here in my heart
And all of the strength in my hands
Your every joy I'll share
Your every tear I'll be there my whole life through
I will take care of you.

On a September afternoon in nineteen-eighty-nine
A Girl waited by a hospital bed, never leaving her mother's side
She said "Mama, why don't you close your eyes, try to get some rest
It's my turn to take care of you
I learned from the best, I will take care of you"

I will take care of you
The very best that I can
With all of the love here in my heart
And all of the strength in my hands
Your every joy I'll share
Your every tear I'll be there my whole life through
I will take care of you
