Know your faults 
Know your friends 
Be prepared to take revenge 

Thought I feed it 
Keep it alive 
Watch it dissolve into slaughterhouse five 
Thought I could feed it sift the debris 
Heir to the throne of a suicide king 

Bend like a reed in the wind- 
Violator diplomat 
They slip their fingers in 
Is it alive sift the debris 
Heir to the throne of a suicide king 
-Bend like a reed in the wind- 

The simple plots become confused 
The jaws are locked and we are immune 
From the horizon 

They slip their fingers in 
She smells like the future of money 
She smells like everything 
Simple plots become confused 
The jaws are locked and 
We are immune
