At the end of the Macabees
The Jones find their fault 
At the end of the day 
Don't turn around you'll have to pay 

At the end of the rivers 
Go find your way through every day 
At the end of the rivers 
At the end of the Macabees 

The Jones find their fault 
At the end of the day 
Don't turn around you'll have to pay 
What did you do today 
I brought you this way
