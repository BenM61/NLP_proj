Sometimes I feel lonely
Sometimes I feel sad
Sometimes I grow weak
But I always know that you're there

Sometimes I am so selfish
Sometimes I fill up with pride
But I always know that
You're right there by my side

If I had to do it over
I'd have met You long before
I'd have given my whole life to You
I'd have given my whole life

And now my only question
How can I love You more
I want to give You
All that I am
I give You all I am

[Chorus]
So take me down the corridor
That leads me to the cross
Take me to where You are
Lord I want to be where You are
Take me down the corridor
That leads me to Your house
Take me to where You live
Lord I want to be where You live

Sometimes I question my existence
Sometimes I wonder why I'm here
But when I realize Your ability to use me
It becomes clear, so clear

And when I look into the eyes
Of my child so innocent
There's evidence of Your love
Evidence of You

Then it makes me realize
That's how You see me
Made within Your image
So pure and perfectly

[Chorus]

Regardless of how I feel
It's Your word I will rely on
'Cause the road is ever narrow
So I'll heed to Your command

[Chorus]
