Now you can't always get what you want 
No, you can't always get what you need 
Sometimes you lose what you thought you had 
Now that's a real bad deal indeed 
But when you're angry at life itself 
Having a bad, bad day 
Don't judge yourself so brutally 
I can't stand it when you talk that way 
Oh baby, baby 
Better back off of that stuff 
You'd better take it slow 
I know you know 
That you're talking about someone I love 
Did you say what I think I heard? 
Did you mean what I think you said? 
Why don't you redirect your rage 
Onto someone else instead 
Now, we all have to walk that line 
Between sorrow and happiness 
Come over here and take my hand 
Won't you please give us both a rest? 
Oh baby, baby 
Better back off that stuff 
You'd better take it slow 
I know you know 
That you're talking about someone I love 
Oh baby, baby 
I've heard enough 
'Cause I know you will come through 
And you know it too 
You're talking about someone I love
