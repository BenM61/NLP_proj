Jesse's all alone and crying
Jesse what have you done wrong?
You can't sit there feeling sorry for yourself
Get a life and make sure you be strong 
She said
Nobody really loves me
Nobody really cares
Won't somebody please help me?
I just need someone to be there

(Chorus)
Jesse close your mind to hurtful cries and people's lies
Jesse I understand, take my hand, feel alright 

Hey Jesse, I think that I can help you
Cos I used to feel like you do
I know someone who can solve all your pain
He was there for me and for you he will too

She said
No you don't understand me
Nobody ever does
I'm too frustrated with my life
I wanna get off and end it with no fuss

(Chorus)
Jesse close your mind to hurtful cries and people's lies
Jesse I understand, take my hand and feel alright
Jesse feel your life , see the light, touch the mind
Jesse I understand, take my hand and feel alright

Don't you feel that way
Hear the words I say
Face the world today
Hold your hands to pray

Yeah, you close your mind to hurtful cries and people's lies
I understand so take my hand and don't tell lies
Don't be afraid of plans you've made don't delay
Live for today hear what I say it's not too late!
