I knew when I first saw you
On the show room floor
You were made for me
I took you home
And dressed you up in polyester
Princess of my dreams
Emotionless and cold as ice
All of the things I like
The way you look
The way you move
The sounds you're making
In Ultrachrome, latex, and steel

[Chorus]
I plug you in
Dim the lights
Electric Barbarella
Your perfect skin
Plastic kiss
Electric Barbarella
Try to resist
Then we touch
Hallucinate and tranquilize

(She's so fine)
(She's all mine)

Our private life is subject to investigation
No time to waste
People say they heard about our deviation
But you never looked so good
Wear the fake fur fake pearls for me
And put on your mystery
The way I feel you know
I never keep you waiting
In Ultrachrome, latex, and steel

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

Princess of my dreams
Princess of my dreams
Majordomo plasticomo Barbarella
(She's so fine)
Pro genetic your Electric Barbarella
(She's all mine)
My pretty pretty
Pretty pretty
Barbarella
Barbarella
Barbarella
Barbarella
