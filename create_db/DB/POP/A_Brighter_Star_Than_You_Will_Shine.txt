Down on the flag stones
The accordians
And sweet trumpets rise
Rusty memories
Of sin and doubting
Mingle in around
The Queen Street
Traffic noise
Would that all the love in the world
Watch me through the night
You know the preacher
All he preaches is vanity
Maybe, at last, you`ll see
A brighter star than you will shine one day
Hymns and words and busy planets
Said the preacher have come and gone
Even your smile will one day die away
When your wealth and words are forgotten
Would that all the love in the world
Stay with me tonight
You know the preacher
All he preaches is vanity
Maybe, at last, you`ll see
A brighter star than you will shine one day
