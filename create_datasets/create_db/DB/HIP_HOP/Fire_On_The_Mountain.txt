There is fire on the mountain,
And nobody seems to be on the run.
Oh there is fire on the mountain top,
And no one is a running.

I wake up in the morning
Tell you what I see on my TV screen
I see the blood of an innocent child,
And everybody's watching.

Now, I'm looking out of my window,
And what do I see?
I see an army of soldiers that are
Marching across the street 

What did they say to make you so blind,
To your conscience and reason?
Could it be love for your country,
Or for the gun you use in killing? 
So,

There is fire on the mountain,
And nobody seems to be on the run.
Oh there is fire on the mountain top,
And no one is a running.

Hey, Mister lover man!
Can I get a chance to talk to you?
'Cause you are fooling with a dead man's corpse,
And you don't know what you do. Oh

So little Lucy turns sixteen,
And like the movie she's been seeing,
She has a lover in her daddy.
She can't tell nobody
'Till she makes the evening news.

For there is fire on the mountain,
And nobody seems to be on the run.
Oh there is fire on the mountain top,
And no one is ah running. Oh yes.

One day the river will overflow,
And there'll be nowhere for us to go,
And we will run, run
Wishing we had put out the fire, oh no
