I wrote to fear, to disappear 
At most a kiss, this time
I'll be the boy, I'll packet the earth
Into the abyss, we'll climb
At most a kiss, this time 

Is it on? 
Someone said that you left town
But I've been holding on too long 
Someone said that, boy, she's gone
If it's time, then I'm yours, so let me know

She wedded her man 
Let's elope to Japan 
Between the Rosemary wilds we'll hide
I thought I was your boy, the earths on hold
I'll packet a stone I find 
At most a kiss, this time 

Is it on?

Someone said that you left town
But I've been holding on too long 
Someone said that, boy, she's gone
If it's time, then I'm yours, so let me know

I was thinking you were always mine
We watched the skies fall down 
We'll carry on when worlds divide
This party beast that makes no sound 

Is it on? 
Someone said that you left town
But I've been holding on too long 
Someone said that, boy, she's gone
If it's time, then I'm yours, so let me know

At most a kiss
At most a kiss
At most a kiss
At most a kiss
