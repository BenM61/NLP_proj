Nothing can come close
Nothing can come close
Nothing can come close

I never doubted it
What's for you will not pass you by
I never questioned it
It was decided before I asked why
It's all there ever was
And it's all there ever will be
How could you have questioned us?
It's yourself you deceive

Nothing can come close
To this familiar feeling
We say it all without
Ever speaking

Nothing can come close
To this familiar feeling
We say it all without
Ever speaking

Nothing can come close
To this familiar feeling
We say it all without
Ever speaking

Nothing can come close
To this familiar feeling
We say it all without

Hush now
No need to say the words
At first sight you perfectly heard
Love in all its entirety
Is no less than we deserve

I saw, your face
Some place
I felt this feeling before
Is it deja vu?
Do I somehow know you?

Nothing can come close
To this familiar feeling
We say it all without
Ever speaking

Nothing can come close
To this familiar feeling
We say it all without
Ever speaking

Nothing can come close
To this familiar feeling
We say it all without
Ever speaking

Nothing can come close
To this familiar feeling
We say it all without

Nothing can come close
To this familiar feeling
We say it all without
Ever speaking

Nothing can come close
To this familiar feeling
We say it all without
Ever speaking

Nothing can come close

Nothing can come close

Nothing can come close
To this familiar feeling
Nothing can come close
