Loving you is easy, loving you is wondrous and pure
I shout it from the roof tops
How long must I wait 'til I see your smile

Might of been the moonlight
Caught up in the sparkle in your eyes
So we gotta know I should go slow
But it's not in me to wait

'Cause I'm alive I'm on fire
Shine like a star burst into the sky

Oh the fury of desire
You burn so bright electrify
You light me up you take me higher

I've been down a long road
And I've become a stranger to myself
Digging in my heels and hoping time
Might be kinder if I wait it out

Nothing came from wondering
And I became so small and insecure
Didn't know the cost of all I lost
Until I found it fresh and new
(Again with you)

And I'm on fire
Shine like a star burst into the sky

Oh the fury of desire
You burn so bright electrify
You light me up you take me higher

(Whoa)

Loving you is easy
Loving you is wondrous and pure
I shout it from the roof tops
How long must I wait 'til I see your smile
