Specialize in danger, I'm from Niagara Falls
And now I sit here waitin'
Like an idiot for your call
Words cannot explain
That rattlesnake in my bones
Guess it's time to face the truth
I stand here licked by love
And in the name of love

I wanna go go go, like a burning stuntman

I fry exposed to fire of course
Choke up while I'm breathin' smoke
Come on quench the fire inside my soul
I wanna go go go

Slumberin' volcano, a bout to explode
Puttin' on a smile and then 
You're takin' of your clothes
Words cannot explain
My heart's red pepper blue
And my blood goes boilin' 
Every time I look at you
I'm in danger, how about you

I wanna go go go, like a burning stuntman

You fry exposed to fire of course
Like a flame whisperin' to a moth
Come on quench the fire inside my heart

I wanna go go go
Like a burning stuntman
Like a burning stuntman
