Come on
Have you heard the news
Talk is goin' around
Let me tell you people
What is goin' down

Well, it sure is easy
To get yourself in [Incomprehensible], yes it is
You better be careful, yeah
Every time to touch
Every time to touch

Baby fat
That's where it's at
Baby fat
That's where it's at

All right
Hey there, little school girl
My, you sure look sweet, yes, you do
I'll give you some of my candy
If you come on home with me

Don't tell your papa
What we're gonna do, no
They'll put me in the jail house, yes they will
For the crime of lovin' you
Just for lovin' you

Baby fat
That's where it's at
Baby fat
That's where it's at

Break it down now
Baby fat

People caught upon me
But I won't take their advice
It might get me in trouble
But Lord, it sure is nice

When I look around me
And I see a sweet young thing
Well, my heart just starts to jump in
And I just have to sing
I just have to sing

Baby fat
That's where it's at
Baby fat
That's where it's at

Baby fat
That's where it's at
Baby fat
That's where it's at

Baby fat
Baby fat
Baby fat
