Please return it

Now, now is the time
Time to reckon
Time to beckon, be surprised
Like a letter
I just sent it, please return it, just forget it
When we live the life we live
It's never ours completely
Not completely
Like a movie, like a style, please return it, please return it
Like a favor, like a glance, please return it, please return it

8, 8 is the hour
Hour of our trials, ours too sickening to live
Please return it
Put it back, I take it back, I can burn it
When you let me live my life
You didn't do it completely but you were discreet
Like the year I spent comparing me to you, please return it
Like a servant, like a sewer, please return it, please return it

There's an 'upside' -- there has to be an 'upside'
There's an 'upside' -- there has to be an 'upside'
There's an 'upside'

When you took me by surprise
That's half the fun of everything
Do you miss the point like I do? 
In the certainty of friendships you can ask
Please return it
Bring the balance back to you
In returning

There's an 'upside' -- there has to be an 'upside'
There's an 'upside' -- there has to be an 'upside'
There's an 'upside' -- there has to be an 'upside'
