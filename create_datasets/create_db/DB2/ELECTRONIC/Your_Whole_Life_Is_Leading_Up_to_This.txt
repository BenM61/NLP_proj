All along the way
I've been burden by the hands of fate
The Devil couldn't say
If my wrong is right
I have the night in me
Do you believe

Your whole life is leading up to this
I'm here child
No more, no cry
Cuddle up inside
No fear child

There's only one way out
Only one way out

It's all in what we say
How we live our lives
How we betray
The music that we play

Couldn't be more true
We have the night to be
And do you believe

A million miles in your eyes
I hope you know that I did try
Not a life I deny
But don't you ever leave my side
