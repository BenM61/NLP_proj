Well thinking of my schooldays,I remember Maybeline
Used to dance with her all night she was little sweet sixteen
Her brother used to chase me
He thought I did, but I never could
I used to call him Little Queenie
His name was Johnny B. Good

I used to hold 'till I was older
Then I got bolder
Her brother used to scold her
I left there in the mornin'
Went back to Memphis, Tennessee
You know her brother never found me
And that's all right with me.

I went to New York City to find what could be found
Just for kicks down sixty-six, stopped in L.A. Town
Yes I went to California just to see what I could see
Well nobody knew just where I was
And that's all right with me
You know I met a girl named Carol
And her girlfriend sweet Nadine
Played rock n' roll music
Used to kiss me in between
Roll over Beethoven that happened to be her favorite song
But we never did much rollin'
I didn't stay there long

I used to hold her and try to mold her
Somebody told her, Nadine and I were bolder
I left there in the mornin'
Went back to Memphis, Tennessee
You know I never saw her face again
And that's all right with me

I used to hold her and try to mold her
Somebody told her, Nadine and I were bolder
I left there in the mornin'
Went back to Memphis, Tennessee
You know I never saw her face again
And that's all right with me
