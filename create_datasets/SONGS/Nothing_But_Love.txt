Guess what baby
The things we say came true today
'Cause we listened to our hearts

No one but you will ever do
Our search is through
But our journey's just beginning

Nothing but love can last forever
Nothing but love will start
To mend the place inside your heart
That needed healing

Nothing but love can last forever
Nothing but love will start
To make your head spin round and round
You know you're feeling love

Nothing but love
Nothing but love

Can't read your mind
Lord knows I'm tryin'
But in your eyes I see everything you need to know

Nothing to do but follow you
My aim is true 
I could never ask for any more

And if you walk away
You know that I will follow
To steal back your broken heart
At least until tomorrow
Because whatever comes today
Beside you I can't hide that you're the one

Nothing but love can last forever
Nothing but love will start
To mend the place inside your heart
That needed healing

Nothing but love can last forever
Nothing but love will start
To make your head spin round and round
You know you're feeling

Nothing but love could hold our world together
Nothing but love can start
To let us hear the sounds above that have been screaming love

Nothing but love
