Hey, I done bought that car, brought that mall
Bought my girls all Vicky draws (c'mon)

Me and my crew is throwin' a big party dude (oooh woo yea)
If you come we must all, get along (get along, get along, get along)
Ladies no pants, all I want to see is thongs (is thong, is thong)
I hope no beef jumps off - hell naw (hell naw)
We all money owners, so be proud y'all, ohh

Hey (hey) . . .

Who makin' his rounds, who givin' up pounds
and five minutes later nowhere to be found? (Sheis Sheis)
Who up in the lot, about to get shot
cause ladygirls man caught her touchin' my spot (whoo, damn)
Now who got a be	, nah who got a V
and who the nigga got 'em both with PS3? (Sheis Sheis)
They give me a charge, I give 'em a plea

Yo, so many drugs in me, I just totalled this ride
and totally forgot it came from Tim
So, anyone ask for me, you betta' tell 'em

[Chorus: Shade Sheist and Timbaland]
Hey (hey) . . .

[Verse: Shade Sheist]
(Hey) I done spoke so long, niggas got to stop
and give the slot another quarter (quarter, quarter)
Flows, they been heated as long as I been
writing rhymes and using the tape recorder (recorder, recorder)
Shade, he's Sheis, he's never nice
so full of himself he make ya say his name twice (Sheis Sheis)
Notice the chain, then notice how your eyes
never seem to work the same again? Damn
From L.A. to Boston, a nigga gon' stun proud
like my name was Stone Cold Austin (Austin)
So gimme a minute (just gimme a minute) 
And let find the reciepts I'll show you how much shit is costin' (costin')
