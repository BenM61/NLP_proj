Everybody say ah, ah 
Yeah, its 50 cent
And Lloyd Banks 
And Young Buck 
Yeah, and Joe 
G-Unit! 
Everybody say (la la la la la la la la la la la la)
Rock 'n' roll wit ya to the cover 
We'll still hit the blocks and I'm sold with you 
Can you picture me and you not even friends no crew 
We can do whatever you wanna do 
I'll take your mind off whatever you going through 
Just sit back and relax to the sound of the sax, I'm hood 
But that don't mean I ride around with the rats 
I work and make the music lose a 
Couple pounds in the sack 

Look at what we got right here 
Such a work of art 
Someone I'll give my heart 
Do anything that's what I do 
Just so that she would be mine 
I'll give her all my time 
Every part of me my mind 
Soul and my body were inseparable 

[Chorus] 
Ride wit u, lie wit u 
I wanna move with u, move with u, move with u 
I wanna fly with u, ride with u, lie with u 
I wanna move with u, move with u, move with u 
I wanna ride 

Your the type that just don't care 
If its you I want 
Then I'm gonna come and get you 
And see what's really good with you 
Please believe I'll take you there 
But first let's see if you're intellectual 
Matches up with your physical baby 

[Chorus] 

Come on and ride with a thug we can do what you like 
A baller baby you see the blue in my ice 
Drop the top and let your head blow back 
Them J. Lo jeans girl that ass so fat 
Puff know just what to do with all that 
Chest to chest so I'll hit it from the back 
I do it like a pro won't nobody know 
Lets pop some more ride and listen to Joe 

I just want to let u know that 
That oh you're so beautiful (you're so beautiful) 
And that nothings impossible 
The places that we can go (we can go anywhere baby) 
I just want to let you know 
That oh you're so beautiful (you're so beautiful) 
And that nothings impossible 
The places that we can go (we can go anywhere baby) 

[Chorus: x2] 

I just want to let u know that 
That oh you're so beautiful (you're so beautiful) 
And that nothings impossible 
The places that we can go (we can go anywhere baby) 
I just want to let you know 
That oh you're so beautiful (you're so beautiful) 
And that nothings impossible 
The places that we can go (we can go anywhere baby)
