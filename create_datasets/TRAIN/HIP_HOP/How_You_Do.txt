I don't need to be
The one that walks around
Without a smile on my face;don't need a frown on my face
I don't care bout yesterday
Threw all my numbers away
Ever since you came to me; showed me the things I could not see.

Baby now you're the one who understands.  Out of all the guys I met
You make me smile every time you get close my emotions run away.
How ya make me feel this way; I don't know boy I think you've
Got me.

I'm not beefin'
I'm not fussin'
I'm not stressing you
I'm just sayin' I'm open off of how you do

I'm not buggin'
It feels so good when I'm touching you
All I"m sayin' is I'm open off of loving you.

I never have to wait-wait for you to call
'cause all of the silly chicks you're used to
Can't come close to me at all
And there ain't never been a time
When you would not ride for me
'cause I'll be the one to wash your hair
Be everything you need.

I never thought that everyday could be a sunny day
But baby since you came into my world
I have something you need.
