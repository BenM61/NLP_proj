I did all that I should  well all that I could  but will I be clean? 
I did all that I should  well all that I could  but it isn't me 
All my strength is dead and gone

Slept as long as I could  as long as I should  to find comfort here 
Slept as long as I could  as long as I should  but I still have fear 
All my strength is dead and gone

Black letter day 
All the fun has gone away 
Black letter day 
All the joy has gone away 
Black letter day 
All my strength has gone away 
Black letter day 

I drank all that I could, much more than I should, in simple despair 
I drank all that I could, much more than I should, to find someone there 

Once upon a time there was a scientist with the nose made of silver, he found 
That there were far too hurtless days a year that one could do without, he called 
Them black letter days and the rest is silence

I hope Monday will be a better day
