Lord i'm thankful for my blessings
everything that you gave 
Times when danger was around me
My life lord you saved
Where would I be without your love
Where would I be without your grace
You didn't have to do it but I'm glad you did 

Can't pretend that what I got 
I got it on my own
Every move that i made 
Can't say I never been wrong
When I fell you picked me up again
Thought I brought it on myself
I can always depend on you
Whenever I need help

[Chorus:]
Lord I'm thankful for my blessings
everything that you gave 
Times when danger was around me
My life lord you saved
Where would I be without your love
Where would I be without your grace
You didn't have to do it but I'm glad you did

The next time you go to sleep
And you wake up alright
Remember that he kept you safe
And warm all through the night
Lift your hands and lift them high 
And this is what you say
Lord you didn't have to give me
One more day

[Chorus]

Thank you, Thank you, Thank you
It's plain to see 
all that he's done for me
I thank you for everything
I live my life 
So I can let the world 
know that I am

[Chorus]
