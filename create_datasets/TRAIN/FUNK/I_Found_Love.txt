Said I wouldn't be bothered with lovin' no one else
Oh, I took my heart and soul, and put ?em on the shelf
Well, I was so low that to me the ground was high
I was about to let life just pass me by

There you were one day standin' in front of me
Askin' me if you could have this heart of mine
Opened my eyes and somehow made me see
And this ol' rusty, dusty heart of mine, how you've made it shine (Shine)
I'm so glad you're in my life, I'm so glad you're mine

I found love (I found love)
I found love
I found love (I found love)
And I'm so glad you're in my life
So glad that you're mine

I was so wound up in love till it had me blind
The writing on the wall couldn't read between the lines
Well, I was dressed in silk and satins on the town
I was always lost, but never ever found

There you were one day standin' in front of me
Askin' me if I would give your love a try
Opened my eyes and now I know why
And this ol' rusty, dusty heart of mine, how you've made it shine (Shine)
I'm so glad you're in my life, I'm so glad you're mine

I found love (I found love)
I found love, oh
I found love (I found love), oh, yeah
And I'm so glad you're in my life
So glad that you're mine

I found love (I found love)
I put my heart above the shelf
Said I'd love nobody else (Ooh, ooh)
Ooh ooh ooh (I found love), oh, yeah
And I'm so glad you're in my life
So glad that you're mine

I found love
