My heart tells me stay but my pride tells me go

I know you're doing lots of things that ain't right
You're out with a different crowd almost every night
You're making me look like a crazy fool
Why do I have these doubts about leaving you

My heart tells me stay and my pride tells me go
But how can I leave you when I love you so
Which way should I turn, I'd sure like to know?
My heart tells me stay but my pride tells me go

I'd be much better off to get you off of my mind
And make you a mem'ry that I'd like to leave behind
I know that misery's all you'll put me through
Why do I have these doubts about leaving you

My heart tells me stay and my pride tells me go
But how can I leave you when I love you so
Which way should I turn, I'd sure like to know?
My heart tells me stay but my pride tells me go
