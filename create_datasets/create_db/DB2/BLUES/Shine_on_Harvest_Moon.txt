The night was mighty dark so you could hardly see,
And the moon refused to shine;
Couple sittin' underneath the willow tree; for love they pined.
The little maid was kinda 'fraid of darkness, so
She said, "I guess I'll go."
The boy began to sigh, looked up in the sky,
And told the moon his little tale of woe.

Shine on, shine on, harvest moon up in the sky;
I ain't had no lovin' since January, February, June or July.
Snow time ain't no time to stay outdoors and spoon,
So shine on, shine on, harvest moon, for me and my gal.

I can't see why a boy should cry when by his side
Is a girl he loves so true;
All he has to say is, "Won't you be my bride, for I love you."
But why should I be telling you this secret when
I know that you can guess?
Harvest moon will smile, shine on all the while,
If the little girl should answer "Yes"!

Shine on, shine on, harvest moon up in the sky;
I ain't had no lovin' since January, February, June or July.
Snow time ain't no time to stay outdoors and spoon,
So shine on, shine on, harvest moon, for me and my gal.
