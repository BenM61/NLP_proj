Who could send something so pure to lure me away
I fought with the last of my breath
But you came along on a glorious day
By the time that you left I was crawling again
Yeah you came along on a glorious day
Now I want you to save me again

The fire that they said would burn just lights up the way
I lie in the place where I fell
And three is always nine day one
That wont go away
Till you bring an end to my hell

But you came along on a glorious day
By the time that you left I was crawling again
Yeah you came along on a glorious day
Now I want you to save me again

Let them all keep their plans
'Cause all I want is in my hands
And I cant look down
Back then I had it all, now I want it back that's all
And I cant get out

You came along, on a glorious day
By the time that you left
I was crawling again
Yeah you came along on a glorious day
Now I want you to save me again
Now I want you to save me again
Now I want you to save me again
