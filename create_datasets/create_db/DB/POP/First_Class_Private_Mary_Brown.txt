First Class Private, Mary Brown, 
she wore that uniform like a million dollar gown . . . 
How my heart would leap when she drove the Jeep 
with the one big stripe on her arm, 
and it seemed to me that a PFC 
stood for "perfect feminine charm" ! 
 
First Class Private, Mary Brown, 
Oh! how she smiled at me when they shipped me out of town . . . 
Let the big guns roar, let me win this war, 
'cause I want to hurry right back 
to First Class Private, Mary Brown, my wonderful WAC! 
 
( Doo, doo, doo doo, doo . . . ) 
First Class Private, Mary Brown, 
I've got her army serial number written down . . . 
She's got bulgy eyes, but when she marched by, 
I just had to look at her twice, 
And it struck me then that the ASN 
Meant an "angel, specially nice"! 
 
First Class Private, Mary Brown, 
could make the PX seem like the Ritz in New York town . . . 
Let the big guns roar, let me win this war, 
'cause I want to hurry right back (on the double) 
To First Class Private, Mary Brown, my wonderful WAC
