All the leaves are brown
And the sky is gray
I went for a walk
On a winters day

I'd be safe and warm
If I was in L.A.
California dreamin'
On such a winters day

Went through the church, just me
I stopped along the way
When I got down on my bended knee
And I began to pray

You know the preacher digs a call
'Cos he knows I'm gunna stay
He knows I'm gunna stay, I told him so
California dreamin'

Oh, somebody hit me now
I wanna go so bad, yeah

'Cos all the leaves are brown
And the skies are gray, yeah
I went for a walk
On a winter's day, ooh

I'd be safe and warm
If I was in L.A.
California dreamin'
On such a winter's day
Such a winter's day
On such a winter's day
Yeah, yeah, woah

California dreamin'
California dreamin'
Gotta, gotta, gotta get some sunshine
Can't believe I blew my mind

Gotta get some sunshine
California dreamin'
California dreamin'
Ohh, gotta get some

California dreamin', ohh
California dreamin'
Gotta get to L.A.
Get some sunshine every day
California dreamin', ohh
