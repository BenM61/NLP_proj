I used to have none
Now with you, I've got one
If I could get just one more
Then you know what you're in for

You ain't getting any sleep tonight
I hope that you girls don't fight
And I hope that you won't run away
'Cause I'm halfway to a threeway

I tried again and again
To indulge in just one sin
All you have to do is lie there
While I push aside your wheelchair

And I do everything it takes
To change your mind and apply your brakes
So I know that you can't roll away
'Cause I'm halfway to a threeway

Can't wipe the smile off my face
When you strut by in your leg brace
You just can't climb the stairs
And you ain't got any hair

I just can't get you to sit
You and your stupid epileptic fits
And I know that you can't run away
'Cause I'm halfway to a threeway

As I lay you down on my bed
It don't matter that you're brain dead
I can get so you close to ya
Now that you're in a coma

I'll make it sweet but short
When I pull out your life support
And I know that you'll just fade away
Now I'm halfway to a threeway
And I know that you'll just fade away
Now I'm halfway to a threeway
