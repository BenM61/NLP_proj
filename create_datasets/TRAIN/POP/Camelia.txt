From where I stand I can see all the lights in the city
For one man to love one woman so much it's a pity
From where I stand I can see the cantina she goes to
Where she's not supposed to but goes anyway
From where I stand I can hear the music and laughter
Camelia keeps tellin' me that's all her young heart is after
I see it differently, I see her there with a man
Camelia keeps lyin', I see, from where I stand
If there was one ounce of man left in me I'd accuse her
What's left of a man knows for certain if I do I'll lose her
It wouldn't do to let her know I know she's lyin'
Or that I've been spyin', she'd never come back
Camelia, I almost despise the ground that you walk on
The reason I don't is, it's me not the ground, that you walk on
Constantly tormented knowing you're just partly mine
Camelia, I hate you and love you at the same time
