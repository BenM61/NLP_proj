No questions asked
No reason to give an explanation
It's trust against your will
My accomplice in a crime of compassion
Would you let me go
Let me go?

It's the hardest thing
The hardest thing
I'm ever gonna have to do
It's the hardest thing
The hardest thing
You're ever gonna help me do
Would you help me?
Would you help me?
Be my liberator?
'Cause I need you now
Need you more
Need you more than ever before
Would you comply
To live or let die?
You've got to send your heart to me

[Chorus]
Send your heart
Send your heart
Send your heart to me
It's an act of mercy
Send your heart
Send your heart
Send your heart to me
It's an act of mercy
Send your heart
Send your heart
Send your heart to me
It's an act of mercy
Send your heart
Send your heart
Send your heart to me

Fatalistic
Control my own fate
Is a mystic
Won't you aid in my escape
I want it easy
No complications
Want to feel no pain
Want to feel no pain

It's the hardest thing
The hardest thing
I'm ever gonna have to do
It's the hardest thing
The hardest thing
You're ever gonna help me do
Would you help me
Would you help me
Be my liberator
'Cause I need you now
Need you more
Need you more than ever before
Would you comply

I need it
I need it
I need it
I need it
I need it
I need it
Send, send
Send your heart to
Send your heart to me

[Chorus]

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Won't you help me?
Won't you help me?
Won't you help me?

It's an act of mercy
Hey, hey, oh
It's an act of mercy
Mercy
Mercy
It's an act of mercy
