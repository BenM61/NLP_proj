Put your ladder down
Put your ladder down
Put your ladder down

Don't be concerned
It's just the way that gravity works round here
All slowly rising, falling patiently
Feel no
Feel no fear

Cirrus caress you
Cumulus kiss you
Raindrops of crystal
Whisper "we'll miss you"
But go
Let go

Always and always and always ascending
The opening line leaves an uncertain ending
Always and always and always ascending
The chords seem to pause, but ah never gonna resolve

Never going to resolve
Never going to resolve
Never going to resolve
Never going to resolve
Never going to resolve
Never going to resolve
Never going to resolve

Talk to me
Talk to me
C'mon talk to me
Talk to me
Yeah talk to me
Talk to me
Ah

And wake me up
C'mon wake me up

Waking up dry
Waking up dusty
Feeling remorse
Feeling thirsty
Bring me a cup
Bring me water

We can ascend
From this arrangement
We can see fate
As entertainment
Bring me a cup
But bring me water
Yeah, bring me water

Always and always and always ascending
The Shepard misleads so you think you're transcending
Always and always and always ascending
Pause the progression, but ah never gonna resolve

Never going to resolve
Never going to resolve
Never going to resolve
Never going to resolve
Never going to resolve
Never going to resolve
Never going to resolve

Talk to me
Talk to me
C'mon talk to me
Talk to me
Now talk to me
Talk to me
Ah

And then wake me up
C'mon wake me up

Waking up dry
Waking up dusty
Feeling remorse
Feeling thirsty
Bring me a cup
And bring me water
Yeah, bring me water
Yeah, bring me water
Bring me water
Bring me water, yeah

Put your ladder down
Put your ladder down
Put your ladder down
Put your ladder down
Put your ladder down
Put your ladder down

Cirrus caress you
Cumulus kiss you
Raindrops of crystal
Whisper "we'll miss you"
But go
Let go
