I'm a slave to your love religion... 
I believe in obsession, baby 
You're driving me insane 
I'm addicted to your sweet lovin' 
A Venus in chains 

If I resign to this big temptation 
You're the one to blame 
Made me an addict of passion 
Like a Venus in chains 

Here's Venus in the chains of love 
Feels so good, can't get enough 
Chained up to her destiny 
All you need is fantasy 

Step inside this vacant dream 
Let me show you what it means 
I'll convince you - here's your fate 
Step right in and celebrate 

I believe in obsession, baby 
You're driving me insane 
I'm addicted to your sweet lovin' 
A Venus in chains 

If I resign to this big temptation 
You're the one to blame 
Made me an addict of passion 
Like a Venus in chains 

If I resign to this big temptation 
You're the one to blame 
Made me an addict of passion 
Like a Venus in chains 

I will surrender to love's seduction 
Take venture as a game 
'Cause I'm a slave to the love religion 
A Venus in chains 

I'm a slave to your love religion... 

I believe in obsession, baby 
You're driving me insane 
I'm addicted to your sweet lovin' 
A Venus in chains 

If I resign to this big temptation 
You're the one to blame 
Made me an addict of passion 
Like a Venus in chains 

You came, you saw and you conquered, baby 
You took away the pain 
Now I'm a slave to your love religion 
A Venus in chains.
