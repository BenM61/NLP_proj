He was a kid,
Who lived in a box
Stuck in between
A win and a loss
He made up his mind,
He wanted to rock
He sweat 'til he bled,
The city was hot

Off of the page,
He wrote in his head
Awfully strange,
The things that he said
No time to waste,
He's rotting in bed
But all through his pain, 
He was laughing instead

7,8, 9, 10, 11 P.M.
He's bumpin' to the beat without a single friend
Solo on the floor and it just don't stop until he sees the stars
12, 1, 2, 3, 4 A.M.
And when the night's over, he will do it again
Solo on the floor and it just don't stop 'til he sees the stars
He's a lost cause

He was a kid,
Who lived by the wheat
Who laid while awake,
But slept on his feet
He put on a show,
His stage was the street
He walked like a dog,
The city would see

Off of the page,
He wrote in his head
Awfully strange,
The things that he said
No time to waste,
He's rotting in bed
But all through his rage,
He was laughing instead

7,8, 9, 10, 11 P.M.
He's bumpin' to the beat without a single friend
Solo on the floor and it just don't stop until he sees the stars
12, 1, 2, 3, 4 A.M.
And when the night's over, he will do it again
Solo on the floor and it just don't stop 'til he sees the stars
He's a lost cause

Can't find out find out from someone else
The moves you make don't move themselves
You can't have everything tomorrow, no, no, no
So when you wake up with the shakes
And hold your breath for your big break
Think you've finally lost your place,
It's just waitng for you.

'Come on
7,8, 9, 10, 11
