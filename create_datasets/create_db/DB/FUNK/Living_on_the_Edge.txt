You know I've had my share of dealing with despair.
I'm tired of seeing my dreams vanish in the air.
Enough of users and all them two time losers.
I've seen that killing floor and I just won't take no more.

So I'm gonna move out on the highway. 
Head on down the road leaving it all behind. 
Had enough of lying. There'll be no more crying this time.
Living on the edge. Running with the wind.
Soaring to the heights on an eagle's wing. 

If you wanna see your spirit flying free.
Then step outside your mind and cross over the line.
Don't spend your lifetime weeping.
For things that ain't worth keeping.
Life can be very short and you know everybody is bought. 

So I'm gonna move out on the highway. 
Head on down the road leaving it all behind. 
Had enough of lying. There'll be no more crying this time.
Living on the edge. Running with the wind.
Soaring to the heights on an eagle's wing. 

It's time to go down to Mexico.
Mescalitos' song will help you to be strong. 

So come on move on down the highway.
Head on down the road leaving it all behind.
Had enough of lying. There'll be no more crying this time.
