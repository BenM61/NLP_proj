Da da da, da da da
This time
Da da da, this time
Making Christmas
Making Christmas (ooh)
Making Christmas, making Christmas
Is so fine

It's ours this time
And won't the children be surprised

It's ours this time
Making Christmas
Making Christmas
Making Christmas
Time to give them something fun
They'll talk about for years to come
Let's have a cheer from everyone
Dum Da Da
Da Daoh

Snakes and mice get wrapped up so nice
With spider legs and pretty bows
It's ours this time
All together, that and this
With all our tricks we're making Christmas time
Ha ha ha

I don't believe what's happening to me
My hopes, my dreams, my fantasies
Ah, ha ha ha

Won't they be impressed, I am a genius?
See how I transform this old rat
Into a most delightful hat
Hmm, my compliments from me to you
On this your most intriguing hat
Consider though this substitute
A bat in place of this old rat
Huh! No, no, no, now that's all wrong
This thing will never make a present
It's been dead for much too long
Try something fresher, something pleasant
All together, that and this
With all our tricks we're making Christmas time

'Cause when the full moon starts to climb
We'll all sing out
It's Christmas time
