Sweetest girl in all the world
His eyes are for you only
Sweetest girl in all the world
His eyes are for you only
Sweetest girl in all the world
His words have died before me
Sweetest girl in all the world
His words have died before me

When they walk in the park, I never can tell
When they walk in the dark, I never can tell
It's just loving ooh loving

The sweetest boy in all the world
His life has got so lonely
Sweetest boy in all the world
His life has got so lonely
Sickest group in all the world
How could they do this to me
The sickest group in all the world
How could they do this to me

What I want I will take, what you think that you know
Oh such an awful mistake to never let go
It's just loving ooh loving

The weakest link in every chain
I always want to find it
The strongest words in each belief
Find out what's behind it
Politics is pride too
Vagaries of science
She left because she understood
The value of defiance

When the government falls, I wish I could tell
When, oh when necessity calls, I never can tell
It's just loving ooh loving

Sweetest girl in all the world
These words are for you only
Sweetest girl in all the world
These words have died before me

When they walk in the park, I never can tell
When they walk in the dark, you know that it never can be told
