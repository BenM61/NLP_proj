There is no Christmas
Like a home Christmas
With your dad and mother
Sis an' brother there!

With their hearts humming
At your home comin'
And that merry yuletide spirit
In the air!

( You can feel that
yuletide spirit! )

Christmas bells, Christmas bells
Ringing loud an' strong
Follow them, follow them
You've been away too long!

There is no Christmas
Like a home Christmas
For that's the time of year
All roads lead home!

( merry Christmas,
Merry, merry Christmas! )

Christmas bells, Christmas bells
Ringing loud an' strong
Follow them, follow them
You've been away too long!

There is no Christmas
Like a home Christmas
For that's the time of year...
The time when all roads lead home!

La, la, la la...
