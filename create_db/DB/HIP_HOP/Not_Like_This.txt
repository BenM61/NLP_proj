Girl, I know a thing or two about the way things go
With someone as fine as you
You be constantly dealin with the drive-bys 
And the way guys be spittin at you
So it's hard for me to think
That you ain't had love
Ain't been you he thought the world of
And I just can't see
How even a playa wouldn't be
Ready to settle down

(Chorus)
You never been cared for (no not like this)
Girl, don't look no further
You never made love before (no not like this)
It's just for you
You say you had everything
And nothing was missing
What you thought was right is wrong
So baby just let me in
Girl, I know you had it but not like this

Girl, you must have heard all the things I'm tellin you
I'm not tryin to pressure you
But, I have to come at you with what I really feel
Girl, I, I'm sick over you
You ain't been told 
That you're worth more than gold (now you know)
Girl, you are
Now, girl, I'll take the time
The time to treat you right
'cause, girl, I just want to settle down

Girl, you're so special
I will be the one
That makes you believe (that makes you believe)
That you ain't had a real good man
I just can't see it 
So how could it be that

(Chorus)

So I take all the time that I need
(To show you how I really feel about you)
And I do all the things just to prove
That I never want to be with out you
So baby girl the things you never had
I'll give you, and I'll,
I'll be the one that's gonna claim you
I'll be the one that's gonna name you
Girl, I'll be the one for you. Oh,

(Chorus)

Never had it like this...
Oh no, no, no...
Girl you never had it like this...
No not like this...
You never...
