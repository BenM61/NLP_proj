I'm growing so distant
Nothing makes sense to me anymore
I'm learning to resist
Becoming more than you ever were

Can't explain, what's come over me (come over me)
Can't explain, why it's so hard for me,
So hard to see your side.

Projecting all my anger
I can't seem to get this through to you
The walls are closing in
I dare you to walk in my shoes

Can't explain, what's come over me (come over me)
Can't explain, why it's so hard for me,
So hard to see your side.

Your side,
I won't see your side

Can't explain, what's come over me (come over me)
Can't explain, why its so hard for me,
So hard to see your side.

Can't explain, what's come over me (come over me)
Can't explain, why it's so hard for me,
So hard to see your side.

I won't see your side.
Your side
