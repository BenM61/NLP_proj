I'm in the Bathroom
Listenin' to the girls who saw you in the car
And they want you baby
Can't blame them kinda feel the same
It's about to be a game and I have to win it

Want to know you before they do
And I got a little place we can go to
And you can show me some of your tattoos

Hey mommy take it easy
Just lookin' at you can't phase me
What can I say feel the same way
Lets go somewhere we can play

Why do they call you sexy
I'll tell you why they call you
'Cause your pants be singing
And your smile be ringing
A cool little gangsta style (baby)

Why do they call you sexy
I'll tell you why they call you
'Cause your hips be showing
And your lips be singing
So many reasons to call you sexy

Yo it's the back and G and teeth clean
Colgate the 1 that got me keen
Gotta get to know you boy
'Cause every night your in my dreams
Chest flecks show off your pecks
That's the way you impress
The things you do the sexy ways
To grab the ladies interest

By the DJ moves talking to my boys
Who saw you on the floor and they want you baby
But the way you lookin' over here
Just seems that you made your choice already

Now it's on you
Can I call you
Or do you have a little place we can go to?
And you can show me some of those dirty moves (baby)

Hey pappy take it easy
'Cause I'm lovin' the way you tease me
What can I say
Feel the same way
Lets go somewhere we can play

Why do they call you sexy
I'll tell you why they call you
'Cause your pants be singing
And your smile be ringing
A cool little gangsta style (baby)

Why do they call you sexy
I'll tell you why they call you
'cause your hips be showing
And your lips be singing
So many reasons to call you sexy

Tight clothes lips connect with them eyes closed
And when I'm chillin' and billin' that's how the game goes
Ring on the fair to thinks it's that colour for rainbow
And you ain't even interested in how the grass grow

What's the deal about you?
That makes it feel so right
That's the reason why they call you

Why do they call you sexy
I'll tell you why they call you
'Cause your pants be singing
And your smile be ringing
A cool little gangsta style (baby)

Why do they call you sexy
I'll tell you why they call you
'Cause your hips be showing
And your lips be singing
So many reasons to call you sexy
