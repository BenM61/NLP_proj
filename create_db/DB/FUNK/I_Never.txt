I never bite the hand that feed me
I'm always on call incase you niggas need me
Never decieve ya, put to rest your enemies
You can depend on me, I'll never leave ya
You can believe that in your time of tribulations
I'll be that first nigga shootin without no hesitations
I ride with you niggas whether you right or wrong
I guess it's why us soldiers last so long

I wasn't born with none of you niggas but we be come from the same hood
Fifty dollars gave birth and y'all treated me good
Think I was family so if any nigga disrespect
I'm a grab him and shake him till I break his fuckin neck
Ain't no bottom to this love I go to the ends of the earth
To ensure as long as you with Magic you'll never be hurt
To mentally and physically prepared for gangsta shit
And I pray to my chances of survival rollin with this click
I throw myself in the line of fire to die with a good name
F*ck the fame, let it be said I was made by the game
Found a friend when you found me
And I'm dedicated to TRU so it's alright to put your faith in me

I never bite the hand that feed me
I'm always on call incase you niggas need me
Never decieve ya, put to rest your enemies
You can depend on me, I'll never leave ya
You can believe that in your time of tribulations
I'll be that first nigga shootin without no hesitations
I'm a ride with you niggas whether you right or wrong
I guess it's why us soldiers last so long

Picture the power I possess now with this tank around my neck
I wasn't shit before this so I thank the Lord cause I'm blessed (thank you Lord)
Now I can rest cause I know I'm on my way to the top
And a tank of TRU niggas that refuse to stop
I'm still a rookie but I'm makin more cash then Trump's bookie
Got my tank on shine so it's hard for you not to look at me
Face it, I'm legendary, I'm the first of my kind
I'm makin money nationwide, it's only my first time
I'm in a no lose situation with Beats By The Pound
Whole shit platinum cause no one around to f*ck with the sound
No greater love then being affiliated with y'all
But we all stand together so together we fall
Mr. Magic

I never bite the hand that feed me
I'm always on call incase you niggas need me
Never decieve ya, put to rest your enemies
You can depend on me, I'll never leave ya
You can believe that in your time of tribulations
I'll be that first nigga shootin without no hesitations
I'm a ride with you niggas whether you right or wrong
I guess it's why us soldiers last so long
