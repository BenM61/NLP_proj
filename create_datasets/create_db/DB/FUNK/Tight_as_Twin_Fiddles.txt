I grew up on western swing
Bob Wills had me hooked early in my teens
A fiddle was the only thing I put my fingers on
Faded love was my love till you came along

Oh, now we're tight as twin fiddles in a Bob Wills band
The fiddle we play with came straight from the man
We fiddled around oh, but we both understand
That we're tight as twin fiddles in a Bob Wills band

Here's to the fiddler playin' at my side
Now don't tell me Bob Wills sound ain't alive
(Incomprehensible) twin fiddles let it flow
Her harmony's on right or wrong lets me know

Oh, that we're tight as twin fiddles in a Bob Wills band
The fiddle we play with came straight from the man
We fiddle around oh, but we both understand
That we're tight as twin fiddles in a Bob Wills band
We're tight as twin fiddles in a Bob Wills band
