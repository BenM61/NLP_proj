You're sophisticated
I think I'm naive
Well, let's play the game that way
Yes, that's what I believe

An apple for the teacher
That seems the thing to do
Because I want a learn
About romance from you
An apple for the teacher
Just to show that I'm meek and mild
If you insist on saying
That I'm just a problem child
You're gonna get all my attention
And your wish will be my rule
And maybe you'll be good to me
Just keep me after school
An apple for the teacher
That's how I'd better start
Then after awhile you may give in
And let me bring my heart

An apple for the teacher
That seems the thing to do
Because I wanta to learn
About romance from you
An apple for the teacher
To show I'm meek and mild
If you insist on saying
That I'm just a problem child
You'll get all my attention
Your wish will be my rule
And maybe you'll be good to me
And keep me after school
An apple for the teacher
That's how I'd better start
Then after while you may give in
And let me bring my heart

An apple for the teacher
S'always gonna do the trick

Not if you didn't study
Your arithmetic

I got an apple for the teacher
Gonna make a great success

Well it won't, if you didn't memorise
The Gettysburg address

I got a little bit of glamour
And a charm that's cute and quaint

I may excuse your grammar
And believe you're what you ain't

I got an apple, big red apple for the teacher
That's how I'm fixin' to start

Then after awhile I may give in
And let you bring your heart

Then after awhile she may give in
And let you bring your heart
