Ah say yeah yeah yeah, say yeah yeah yeah
Ah say yeah yeah yeah, say yeah yeah yeah

I try to put my arms around you
All because I want to hold you tight
But every time I reach for you, baby
And try to kiss you, you're just jumping out of sight
Oh, I've got news for you
Baby, that I've made plans for two
I guess I'm just a stubborn kind of fellow
Got my mind made up to love you

Ah say yeah yeah yeah, say yeah yeah yeah

I'm gonna love you
In every way
I'm gonna love you
In every way

With other girls I've wanted
I've made it just a moment
With you I'll share each day
Now I know you've heard about me
Bad things about me, baby, please let me explain
Oh, I have kissed a few
I tell you, a few have kissed me too
I guess I'm just a stubborn kind of fellow
Got my mind made up to love you

Everybody sings
Yeah yeah yeah,  yeah yeah yeah
Everybody sings
Yeah yeah yeah,  yeah yeah yeah
Sing now everybody
Yeah yeah yeah,  yeah yeah yeah
