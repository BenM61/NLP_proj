I spent some time with myself
But my head was on fire because my picture is on your shelf
You always told me that I would be strong
But we get so high there's nowhere to go but up

And when you find yourself in a crowded room
Do you find your head inflating just like me
'Cause I love me

Then late one night a diamond fell from the sky
And I held it up high as it shimmers in your eye

But if I break myself into a million pieces
I'll be unglued
'Cause I love me
