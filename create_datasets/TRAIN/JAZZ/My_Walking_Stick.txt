Without my walking stick, I'd go insane
I can't look my best I feel undressed without my cane.
Must have my walking stick 'cause it may rain
When it pours can't be outdoors without my cane.

If I ever left my house without my walking stick
Well it would be something I could never explain
Oh the thing that makes me click, on lovers lane
Would go for naught if I were caught without my cane.

Be-bop-bop-de-la-dum
Be-bop-a-da-bum
Re-bop-be-a
Rop-a-de-bop
Rump-a-de-dum
Ra-da-da-de

Re-bop-bop-la-da-dum
Re-bop-be-de-a
Rop-a-de-bum
Rop-a-de-bum
Deet-de-de-a
Ra-da-da-dum

If I ever left my house without my walking stick
Well it would be something I could never explain
Oh the thing that makes me click on lovers lane
Would go for naught if I were caught without my cane.
