If you were a bird and you lived very high
You'd lean on the wind when the breeze came by
You'd say to the wind as it took you away
That's where I wanted to go today
And I do know that I need to have you around
And I do, I do know that I need to have you around
Love like a mountain springtime
Flashing through the rivers of my mind

It's what I feel for you
You and me go walking south
And we see all the world around us
The colors blind my eyes and my mind to all but you
And I do know that I need to have you around
And I do, I do know that I need to have you around
Around

I have a house where I can go
When there's too many people around me
I can sit and watch all the people
Down below goin' by me
Halfway down the stairs is a stair
Where I sit and think about you and me
I sit and think about you and me

But I wonder will the sun still see all the people goin' by
Will the moon still hang in the sky when I die
When I die, when I'm high, when I die, when I die?
If you were a cloud and you sailed up there
You'd sail on water as blue as air
You'd see me here in the fields and say
Doesn't the sky look green today?

But I wonder will the sun still see all the people goin' by
Will the moon still hang in the sky when I die
When I die, when I die
When I'm high, when I die, die, die, die, die?
