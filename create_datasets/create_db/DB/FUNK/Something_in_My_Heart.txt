You took my love and I'm willing
There's no limit to the love I'm giving
The love I'm giving

Ooh
Oh yeah

There's no reason why we should be apart
Mmmm, Oh baby
Cause searching for something out there
Will lead two lonely hearts, two lonely hearts
(Baby don't you know)
We come too far to let it all end
I've told you over and over again
How I feel inside but if you go
Oh baby, there's something you should know
Something you should know

(Something you should know)
There's something in my heartmy mind boof
(Something in my heart, something in my heart)
Ooh, has got me hooked on you
(Something in my heart, something in my heart)
Ooh, has got me hooked on you

Baby if we try, thing's will get better
Oh yeah
No one could tell me different
We should be together

(Baby don't you know)
The changes I'm going through
You know I'll never be the same
Your love has touched my soul
There's no one else to blame but you
There's something you should know

(Something you should know)
There's something in my heart
(Something in my heart, something in my heart)
Ooh, has got me hooked on you
Ahh
(Something in my heart, something in my heart)
Ooh, has got me hooked on you
Ahh, yeah

(Baby don't you know)
We come too far to let it all end
I've told you over and over again
How I feel inside but if you go
Oh baby, there's something you should know
Something you should know

(Something you should know)
There's something in my heart
(Something in my heart, something in my heart)
Ooh, has got me hooked on you
Ahh

(Something in my heart, something in my heart)
Ooh, has got me hooked on you
Oh, yes it does
(Something in my heart, something in my heart)
Ooh, has got me hooked on you
Yes it does, why won't you stay?

(Something in my heart, something in my heart)
Ooh, has got me hooked on you
(Something in my heart, something in my heart)
Ooh, has got me hooked on you
