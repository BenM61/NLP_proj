This is mine, it will never be yours
Stay away from what I love
'Cause it's the only thing I've got

Won't stick to those I cannot trust
No matter how you gonna try
I never sell and you can't buy

So don't you tell what's up your sleeve
Lock it away and let me be
I don't mind, I don't care
Lock it away and let me be

This is mine, it will never be yours
I got mine and you got yours

It's written all over your skin
You never out the liar in
As if you knew it's gonna be
The end of you, the end of me

You're going astray, getting carried away
So breathe and receive what you cannot believe
Until you know I don't belong to anyone

Got to give it a break, we are going astray
Tried and true ways have been leading
To demons galore

I got mine and you got yours

Burn down this ground
Meet your path then
