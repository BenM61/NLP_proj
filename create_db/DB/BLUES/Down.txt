Woke up
Hot texas morning
Shades up and take a pee
The weather...
That empty feeling
That comes from way down inside

feeling down again

it's raining
Depression hits me
Mixed up, the sky's all gray
The phone rings
I don't feel like talking
Some things
I can't explain

feeling down again

feeling low, no one home, living life
Feeling cold, growing old in the night

feeling down again

woke up
Hot texas morning
Shades up
Turn on the tv
The weather and that empty feeling
That comes from way down inside
