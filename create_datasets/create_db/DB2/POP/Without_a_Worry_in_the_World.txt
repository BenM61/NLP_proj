You all have seen the vagabond
As he went singing in the dawn
Without a worry in the world
I've never seen a gypsy who
Could be a gypsy through and through
And have a worry in the world

All merry men are minstrels then
Who keep their troubles locked inside
And don't inflict them on the world
Isn't there something to be said
For leaving your troubles home in bed
And never taking them to the road

The sailor cruising into town
Is not afraid to be a clown
Without a worry in the world
No cowboy with an ounce of pride
Will mount his horse and ride
And have a worry in the world

All merry men are minstrels then
Who keep their troubles locked inside
And don't inflict them on the world
Isn't there something to be said
For leaving your troubles home in bed
And never taking them to the road

If I must love then let me love
As thought I've never loved before
Without a worry in the world
If I must go then let me go
And only gently close the door

All merry men are minstrels then
Who keep their troubles locked inside
And don't inflict them on the world
Isn't there something to be said
For having had someone instead
Of never have had any at all

Without a worry in the world
Without a worry in the world

Yes I've got troubles of my own
I'll try to solve them all alone
I won't inflict them on the world
