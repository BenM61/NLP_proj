[Chorus]
I love it when she bossy
Sexy when she bossy
I know I am the boss
I kinda like it when she boss me
Love it when I'm bossy
Touch me when I'm bossy
She thinks she is the boss
She kinda likes it when I'm Bossy
Who da' boss, who da' boss
Who da' boss, who da' boss
She thinks she in control but I'ma let her know
Who da' boss, who da' boss
Who da' boss, who da' boss
When we switch roles I let it be known
I'm da' boss

[Verse 1]
Yeah sun shinin' doin' it like this-a-way
5 star doin' it like everyday
Pick mama up ridin' with the paper plates
Big houses 20 mills own estates
Brought her to my town
Showed her my uptown, showed her my uptown
Show her where I stood my ground
How we did it how we put it down
New money and we blowin' straight out the pound
To the mall let her do what she do
She grind cause she wanna
And she hustlin' too
I do it how I feel
I'm da' boss of my shit
About 8, 9 o clock mama cookin' my shit

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
When you see baby girl nigga rockin' red
Best believe that she doin' it for a nigga
Tear drop on her hand just like her man
14 tear drops nigga I'm the man
Stand my ground do mines uptown
Get it how I live nigga show em how I put it down
When I see her on TV cause
It be like thats my blood (yeah)
Cause she rep me thoroughly
Uptown nigga hold me down thoroughly (yeah)
And she f*ck me patiently
And I love how she work me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
So I'm back in my hood in the neck of my woods
5 star you know I'm good
5 star I'm out my hood
Put in work lil' daddy so you know its good
Mama love my style I can't do it though
Been through a whole bunch of yall solo
You know its all good like I give it up
Gave it up, Got it up
Now I'm still standin' up
I got me somethin' in the plan though
Money in the hand doin' it so brand-o
Bring her to an island let her piece it out
Lovin' my gangster tatted out

[Chorus]

Let it be known I'm the boss
