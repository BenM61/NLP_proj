Ooo, baby, ooo baby girl, oOo Ooo
If I had been there to wipe your tears
Than no one else would be around
If I had been there to cradle your fears
We'd still be together now, now
Wish I could be there to share your dreams
I wish that I could still be down
But now you're gone and I'm here alone
And I sure do regret it, now, oh, yes I do, said, I really do, I'm missing you

Baby, I should've known
Should've cared just a little bit more
I shouldn't have listened to a word from the fellas
I shouldn't have let my sweetie go
Baby, I, I want you to know
If I could take it back, you know that I would
I'd give anything to get things back
Now that I know, all the thing
I should've known

Should've been there with my baby every night
Better kissing her and holding her so tight
How I wish that I could be with you right now
I'd give anything, just to see you smile, smile
But I'm all alone and the 'should haves' and the words
They won't bring you back and I'm the one to blame
I didn't know how to act or save the love
And I do regret it now

Baby, I should've known
Should've cared just a little bit more
I shouldn't have listened to a word from the fellas
I shouldn't have let my sweetie go
Baby, I, I want you to know
If I could take it back, you know that I would
I'd give anything to get things back
Now that I know, all the thing
I should've known

I promise I won't ignore you
You'll never, never ever be alone
Lean on me as your shoulder
