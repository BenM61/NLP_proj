Big world
Please do not swallow us up
Please do not blind our eyes
With ocean blue

Young girl
She’s got time left to grow up
See the light of hope in her eyes
She gives to you

And now I know
Just what we’re fighting for
How long to go
Until we ask for more

And we all might find ourselves
Living below the line
Still living below
The line

One word
Strong as the beating of drums
Loud as the voice inside
It’s more than enough

Fire
Under a burning red sun
Wake up the harmless sky
Show some love

And now I know
Just what we’re fighting for
How long to go
Until we ask for more

And we all might find ourselves
Living below the line
Still living below
The line

Oh oh
And when I stopped to feel, the night began to fall
Oh oh
And in the silence here, the heart of it all
Oh oh
Sometimes it’s hard to find a way to rise above
Oh oh
But now we find our self and know

Just what we’re fighting for
How long to go
Until we ask for more

Now we all might find ourselves
Living below the line
We’re all living below
The line
We’re living below the line
We’re all living below
The line
