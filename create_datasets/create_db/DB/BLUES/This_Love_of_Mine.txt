This love of mine, goes on and on
Though life is empty, since you have gone
You're always on my mind, though out of sight
It's lonesome through the day and all the night

I cry my heart my out, it's bound to break
Since nothin' matters, then let it break
I ask the sun and the moon, the stars that shine
What's to become of it, this love of mine?

I cry my heart my out, it's bound to break
Since nothin' matters, then let it break
I ask the sun and the moon, the stars that shine
What's to become of it, this love of mine?
