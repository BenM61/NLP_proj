Got my eye on you, nothing's slipping by
Watching everything you do, like a Spy
I come here everynight, I'm like a firefly
Moving through the strobe lights, like a Spy

I know your shadow hides, just what I need
There's something there inside, I want to see
I've got to take the lead, undercover lover
I'm so intrigued by you

Been wearing my disguise, for too long a time
Tonight I'm movin' in, like a Spy

I know your shadow hides, just what I need
There's something there inside, I want to see
I've got to take the lead, undercover lover
I'm so intrigued by you

You have your reputation in this town
For dressing up and letting people down
Until I find out for myself, I'll follow you around

You were flying high the night we met
I was just another stranger in your bed
But I remember showing you, one thing you won't forget

So here's a little note for you, it says: "Please reply
I'm the girl with the blue tattoo of you (It's a bunny), I'm the Spy"

I know your shadow hides, just what I need
There's something there inside, I want to see
I've got to take the lead, Undercover lover
I'm so intrigued by you
