Cabaret!

Yes, what good is sitting, alone in the room?
Come, hear the music play
Life is a cabaret, old chum
Come to the cabaret
Put down that knitting
That book and the broom
Time for a holiday
Life is a cabaret, old chum
So come to the cabaret

Come taste the wine
Come hear the band 
Yes, it's time for celebrating
Right this way, your table's waiting!

No use permitting some prophet of doom
Wipe all your smiles away
Life is a cabaret, old chum
So come to the cabaret, yeah!

Come taste the wine
Oh, come hear that band 
It's time for celebrating
Right this way, your table's waiting!

Oh, start, violin
Carry the tune
Yes, it isn't a longer stay, yeah
Life is a cabaret, old chum
Only a cabaret, old chum
So come to the cabaret!
