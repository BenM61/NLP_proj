I've gotta have you
All of you
I've gotta have all of you
Every bit of you

Everything I have is yours
And I will give it to you
I will never let you down
Anything you need just ask
I will give to you
I will never let you down
I'll be around

Everytime I close my eyes
I think of you
Wishing you were here
To make my dreams come true
Just like a child
With a brand new toy
My life is full of ecstasy
It brings me much joy

I really can't help myself
I get weak in my knees
When you're away
I can hardly breathe
It is so amazing
The way you make me feel
I have to stop and think
Is this a dream or is it real

Baby, I love you
Baby you know, baby you know
I'll do anything
So baby, don't worry
I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down
I'll always be around

Lady
Everything you want
You can have it
Everything you need
Come and get it
