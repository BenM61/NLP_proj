How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side, I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat it's all I ever

I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up and brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back
I gotta take it on the other side

Centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I marry the sea
Stranger things could never change my mind
I gotta take it on the other side
Take it on the other side
Take it on, take it on

How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side, I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat it's all I ever

Pour my life into a paper cup
The ashtray's full and I'm spillin' my guts
She wants to know am I still a slut
I've got to take it on the other side

Scarlet starlet and she's in my bed
A candidate for a soul mate bled
Push the trigger and I pull the thread, I gotta take it on the other side
Take it on the other side
Take it on
Take it on

How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side, I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat it's all I ever

Turn me on, take me for a hard ride
Burn me out, leave me on the other side
I yell and tell it that it's not my friend
I tear it down, I tear it down
And then it's born again

How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side, I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat it's all I ever

How long, I don't, I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat it's all I ever
