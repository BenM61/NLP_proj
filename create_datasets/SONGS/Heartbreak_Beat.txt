I'm a heartbreak beat, yea, all night long
And nobody don't dance on the edge of the dark
We've got the radio on
And it feels like love,
But it don't mean a lot
And it feels like love
And it's all that we

There's a heartbreak beat, playing all night long
Down on my street
And it feels like love, got the radio on
And it's all that we need
There's a heartbreak beat, and it feels like love
There's a heartbreak beat, and it feels like love

Well, the feet don't stop, the way you talk so tough
And there's a perfect kiss, somewhere out in the dark
But a kiss ain't enough
And the world don't stop, every time that you call
And the world don't stop, every time that you call

There's a heartbreak beat, playing all night long
Down on my street
And it feels like love, got the radio on
And it's all that we need
There's a heartbreak beat, and it feels like love
There's a heartbreak beat, and it feels like love

I'm a heartbreak beat, yea, all night long
And nobody don't dance on the edge of the dark
We've got the radio on
And it feels like love,
But it don't mean a lot
And it feels like love
And it's all that we

There's a heartbreak beat, playing all night long
Down on my street
And it feels like love, got the radio on
And it's all that we need
There's a heartbreak beat, and it feels like love
There's a heartbreak beat, and it feels like love

There's a heartbreak beat
There's a heartbreak beat
