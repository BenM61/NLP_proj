Hear my silent prayer
Heed my quiet call
When the dark and blue surround you

Step into my sigh
Look inside the light
You will know that I have found you

Hear my silent prayer
Heed my quiet call
When the dark and blue surround you

Step into my sigh
Look inside the light
You will know that I have found you
