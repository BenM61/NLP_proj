Inside of me there is a lonely place
Sometimes I just don't know it's there
But when I'm all alone
That's when I have to face

The part of me that needs someone
To be by my side that's when I call on

You, you make my life complete
You give me all I need
You help me through and through
I'm calling on you

I can't explain just what you do to me
My love grows stronger everyday
You give me love, you give me company
And when I have to face the rain
You bring sunshine into my life

You, you make my life complete
You give me all I need
You help me through and through
I'm calling on you

You, you make my life complete
You give me all I need
You help me through and through

You, you make my life complete
You give me all I need
Calling on you
Calling on you

Calling on you
Calling on you
(Calling on you, now)
(Calling on you, calling on you)
Calling on you, calling on you, now
Calling on you
