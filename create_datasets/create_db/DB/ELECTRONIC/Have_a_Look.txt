Never thought that you'd be mine, I just stayed there to be kind. 
Now you see that you're leaving me, well I don't really care; 
I have other things on my mind. 
Then when you tell me to just get out, well this isn't just your house. 
Well I thought I sort of told you, I guess you didn't listen baby. 
Now that I'm looking for your time, just to see if I'm on your mind. 
I think we're really over now, I saw your girlfriend; 
You and her seem to be fine. 
 
Now that we are through - I realise I want you! 
I try to get you back - but you don't need me! 
Baby, what you thinking now, baby? Ooh, baby, 
Have a look, have a look, look at me! 
Baby, what you thinking now, baby? Ooh, baby, 
I took a change now - Baby! Baby! Baby! Baby! 

I know, I know that I've done something wrong, I never left coz I wasn't strong. 
Now that we're over, I don't think that I could even go on. 
Well I've changed my naughty ways, well I'm telling you I've changed. 
Just come back and stop the crap, work it out with me... 

Now that we are through - I realise I want you! 
I try to get you back - but you don't need me! 
Baby, what you thinking now, baby? Ooh, baby, 
Have a look, have a look, look at me! 
Baby, what you thinking now, baby? Ooh, baby, 
I took a change now - Baby! Baby! Baby! Baby!

I changed my mind, I really changed everything that I had. 
I'm even walking towards you now, and you won't look at me. 
And I'm feeling really used up, yeah I'm getting really mad about it. 
I changed everything for you, and only you. 
You won't even look at me, look at me. 
Oh yeah, look at me, yeah. 
Well it's a fact - I need you, I want you back. 
Just change your mind and we'll be fine, work it out with me. 

Now that we are through - I realise I want you! 
I try to get you back - but you don't need me! 
Baby, what you thinking now, baby? Ooh, baby, 
Have a look, have a look, look at me! 
Baby, what you thinking now, baby? Ooh, baby, 
I took a change now - Baby! Baby! Baby! Baby!

Baby, what you thinking now, baby? 
What you think now, baby!? 
Have a look, have a look - look at me.
