So many roads 
So many trains to ride 
So many roads 
So many trains to ride 
I'm gonna find my baby 
Before I'll be satisfied 

I was standing at my window 
When I heard that whistle blow 
Standing at my window 
When I heard that whistle blow 
Well it sung like a straight line 
But it was below 

It was a mean old fireman 
And a cruel old engineer 
It was a mean old fireman 
And a cruel old engineer 
That took my baby 
And left me standing here
