Go on and close the curtains
'Cause all we need is candlelight
You and me, and a bottle of wine
To hold you tonight (oh)

Well we know I'm going away
And how I wish - I wish it weren't so
So take this wine and drink with me
And let's delay our misery

Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow - tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow - tomorrow I'll be gone

Save tonight

There's a log on the fire
And it burns like me for you
Tomorrow comes with one desire
To take me away (oh it's true)

It ain't easy to say goodbye
Darlin' please, don't start to cry
'Cause boy you know I've got to go (oh)
And Lord I wish it wasn't so

Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow - tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow - tomorrow I'll be gone

Save tonight

Tomorrow comes to take me away
I wish that I, that I could stay
But boy you know I've got to go (oh)
And Lord I wish it wasn't so

Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow - tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow - tomorrow I'll be gone

Save tonight
Save tonight
Come tomorrow
Save tonight
Come tomorrow
Save tonight
