City's breaking down on a camel's back
They just have to go 'cause they don't know whack
So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
You won't get undercounted 'cause you're damned and free
You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they got her kissing, 'cause I don't get sleep, no

Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking, falling down
Love forever, love has freely
Turned forever you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

Laughin' gas these hazmats, fast cats
Linin' 'em up like ass cracks
Play these ponies at the track
It's my chocolate attack
Shit, I'm steppin' in the heart of this here (yeah)
Care Bear rappin' in harder this year (yeah)
Watch me as I gravitate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Yo, we gon' ghost town this Motown
With yo' sound, you in the blink
Gon' bite the dust, can't fight with us
With yo' sound, you kill the Inc. 
So don't stop, get it, get it (get it)
Until you're cheddar head
And watch the way I navigate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha (Ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)

Windmill, windmill for the land

Don't stop, get it, get it
Peep how your captain's in it
Steady, watch me navigate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Don't stop, get it, get it
Peep how your captain's in it
Steady, watch me navigate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
