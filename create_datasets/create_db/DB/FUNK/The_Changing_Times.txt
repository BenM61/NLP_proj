As you discover changing times
You must have the strength to endure
As you discover changing world
You can't be guessing, you must be for sure
In these ever changing times
You must learn to stand up on your own

Life has so much to show you
You must be ready for the new
Space on the strife, fix up your life
Space on the strife, fix up your life

As you discover changing times
It's not so bad as you will find
As you discover changing world
A new direction you must keep in mind

Life has so much to show you
You must be ready for the new
Space on the strife, fix up your life
Space on the strife, fix up your life

We go through so many changes
As we learn to grow
