Sun shine seems so bright
Lonely days go by
No light

Olga sings the light
Evil way in the night

H Mass in the end
Can you cast the night away
'Cuz some of us have to hide
All night

Smashing Indian
Can you make them keep away
'Cuz some of us been to high
High

Didn't know that
Didn't know that
