You're pushing down on my shoulders
And emptying my lungs
And in a moment I'm older
In a moment, you've won
And you escape me
Like it's nothing
Like words I never should have said
And the stress comes to the surface
But all of the heroes are dead

And I hate that I can't say your name
Without feeling like I'm part of the blame
And it's never gonna feel quite the same
But it's never gonna change
And I hate that I'm always so young
Had me feeling like you were the one
And it's never gonna feel like it's done
'Cause it's never gonna change (Change)
Never gonna change (Change)
Never gonna change (Change)
Never gonna change

While I dance here softly
You're next to me again (You're next to me again)
But we're still tugging on each other
And tearing up the fraying loose ends

And I hate that I can't say your name
Without feeling like I'm part of the blame
And it's never gonna feel quite the same
But it's never gonna change
And I hate that I'm always so young
Had me feeling like you were the one
And it's never gonna feel like it's done
'Cause it's never gonna change (Change)
Never gonna change (Change)
Never gonna change (Change)
Never gonna change (Change)

And I hate that I can't say your name
Without feeling like I'm part of the blame
And it's never gonna feel quite the same
'Cause it's never gonna change (Change)
Never gonna change (Change)
Never gonna change (Change)
Never gonna change

'Cause it's never gonna change (Change)
Never gonna change (Change)
Never gonna change (Change)
Never gonna change (Change)
