Ha Oh

All alone in a crowd in a city
Searchin' for love
A handsome guy tells a girl she's so pretty, yeah
But it's never enough

So many tried
So many times I was cheated
Just one look made me realise
From today I won't be mistreated

This is the way love is meant to be
This is the way, in a true love story
This is the way love's supposed to be
You came along to show to me
This is the way
Oh, Yeah, Oh Oh

Never knew just how much I was missin'
You answered my prayer
And from now on I won't be dismissing
The love that we shared
Oh, there is no need to question why
I don't need to give you a reason
I just can't get you off my mind
From today, I began believing

This is the way love is meant to be
This is the way, in a true love story
This is the way love's supposed to be
You came along to show to me, Yeah
This is the way

A love so strong could never die
Can't be wrong, could never lie
That is why
Never again will I have to walk alone baby

This is the way love is meant to be
This is the way, in a true love story
This is the way love's supposed to be
You came along to show to me, Yeah
This is the way
This is the way yeah
Love is supposed to be
You came along to show me baby baby baby yeah
In a true love story
You came along to show to me
This is the way
