Send a revival in the Whitehouse

Send a revival in our schools

Now I got words I gotta say here
Send a revival

Cause the world has gone astray

Pray and seek your faith
You would forgive ourselves
And heal the lame

Send a revival in the streets

Send a revival
That's what we need Lord, we need you to
(Send a revival, send a revival, send a revival)
Send a revival
We're living in a world, in a world of confusion
Where we got mothers, mothers fighting their daughters
We got fathers, fathers fighting their son
Children won't listen, won't listen to their parents
We got children having children
Children killing children
Men likin' men
Women likin' women

What we need you to
Move, move Lord
(Move Lord)
Move, move Lord
(Move Lord)
We need you to move Lord
In our church Lord,
In our home Lord
In the schoolyard
I gotta special request
In the Whitehouse Lord
Touch the President
Touch the President
Let him know in a time of war
We need peace
(woo Lord)
We need peace
(Woo Lord)
A long way Lord

The devil is tryin' to take us out (Woo Lord)
As we sing this Lord (Woo Lord)
What I want you to do is heal Lord (Heal Lord)
Heal Lord
Heal our depression
Heal children of needs
Heal Cancer Lord
Heal aids Lord
The biggest disease, Heal Hatred Lord
Heal hatred Lord

I feel your presence Lord
Ha! two times
Ha! three times
I feel like having some church in here

Move Lord
Move Lord
Right now Lord
Right now Lord
We got another problem
We have some families
We got the mother goin' to church
But the father staying home
We need some balance
Balance spiritually

We need you to save (Save Lord)
Save the father, Lord (Save Lord)
Save the mother, Lord (Save Lord)
Save the heart Lord (Save Lord)
Save the humble Lord (Save Lord)
Save the children Lord (Save Lord)
Save the whole family (Save Lord)

Save it everybody (Save Lord)
Save it everybody (Save Lord)

Now somebody out there going through some real issues right now
Seems like the devil's trying to take control of your life
Don't you know we at spiritual warfare right now
Don't give the devil no room in your life
There's one name the devil can't stand
All you got to do is mean it from your heart
And rare back and call his name
If you call his name, watch the devil flee
All you got to do is call his name
