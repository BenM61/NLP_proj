They say that kid he's got

I'm bringing sassy back,
And everything that you thought you can't forget
Cause y'all know nothing but my name
And I don't wanna hear
About people I don't know
Not you, not him, not her, no

You only see what I let you see,
Nothing less, nothing more
What you say is nothing new to me
Honestly

They say that kid he's got soul
I'm everywhere that you go
And I've been there, seen that, and I ain't taking you home
No-o-o

Oh

And I ain't gonna lie,
I can be a nasty guy
So you should probably sit
Cause yeah my words come kinda quick
And if you don't get it let me repeat it, just forget what you thought

Only see what I let you see
Over and over again
What you say is nothing new to me
Honestly

They say that kid he's got soul
I'm everywhere that you go
And I've been there, seen that, and I ain't taking you home
No-o-o
But what do they know?
I'm everywhere that you go (and I still got soul)
And I've been there, seen that, and I ain't taking you home
No-o-o

Oh

(Yeah, yeah Travis Here we go!)

They say that kid he's got more soul than Flight Club
Can't you tell by the way I use my wall?
Travis stay way cooler than the hand that lose that
Yeah bite too many times worse than my bark
Yeah, took a little time but I'm finally here
Ten years deep just to make things clear
Now I'm doubled up throwing double D's in the air
Go get it off your chest like a tight brassiere
Don't regret it
Just let it
Give credit
Don't sweat it

You can try but you just can't stop,
Fangs up
Cobra style

Honestly

They say that kid he's got soul
I'm everywhere that you go
And I've been there, seen that, and I ain't taking you home
No
But what do they know?
I'm everywhere that you go (and I still got soul)
And I've been there, seen that, and I ain't taking you home
No

I'm everywhere that you go
And I've been there, seen that and I ain't taking you home
