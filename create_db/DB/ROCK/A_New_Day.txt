Waiting for a new day reliving my thoughts alone
At the gates of garden where the joy have never shown
Since I've known

I close my eyes and let your voice lead me tonight
Black painted view I see the river flows your cry

Since I've known I have carried the pain all within
Since I've known my mind have been painted with sin
Since I've known

Waiting for tomorrow frail I need to paint my sorrows away
to find another path into my scars
Waiting for tomorrow frail I need to paint my sorrows away
You bring me the light for my life

I turn off the lights to create the darkness of my own
The evil inside me is growing so strong that I have to let go
