Such a shame, that doctors and workers(?),
Can't just kill the bad part
Return a good boy

Darling, you can be so unforgiving,
You can be so unloving,
You can be misunderstanding
But I don't know how to feel without your love

So tell me what to do

It's a lovely night with the moon in the sky-e-oh

It's a lovely night with that look in your eye-e-oh

But you still sleep with your back to me.
Is me and you or is it really nothin'?

Oh baby, I thought that you forgave me,
I thought that you still loved me,
Don't you need me

I want it forever
I want it forever
I want it forever
I want it forever
I want it forever
I want it forever
I want it forever
I want it forever

I want it forever
I want it forever
I want it forever
I want it forever
I want it forever
I want it forever
I want it forever
I want it forever

It's a lovely night with the moon in the sky-e-oh
It's a lovely night with that look in your eye-e-oh

But you still sleep with your back to me.
Is me and you or is it really nothin'?
