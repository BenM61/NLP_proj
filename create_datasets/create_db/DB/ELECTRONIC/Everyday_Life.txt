Maybe this world is a broken mirror,
Reality in reverse,
Maybe it's just a shadow,
Of a parallel universe, I don't know 

Why do I want to go there? 
Why do I really care? 
Why should I climb a mountain? 
Find your way, if you dare. 

There's a universal language, I shall learn to speak 
Maybe then I will find, the answers that I seek 
And I will fly to higher ground, high above the clouds 
See the stars up closer watch the world go round,

A universal language, we can learn to speak 
Talk with the creator, no more hide and seek 
Global understanding, an end to all the strife 
Seems to me the only challenge that we have, is everyday life
