Now what if I told you my city was the best
And my city was a threat to the rest
And my city was a threat to the rest

This city is my city
And I love it, yeah I love it
I was born and raised here
I got it made here
And if I have my way, I'm gonna stay
Forever we're coming
To every block yeah
Whether it's warm or storming it down or right stupid hot, hot
From the colors all the way to the solutions yeah
Forget all the drugs and gangs, corruption and pollution no

'Cause this city is my city
And I love it, yeah I love it
I was born and raised here
I got it made here
And if I have my way, I'm gonna stay here
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh

Now what if I told you my city was the best
And my city was a threat to the rest
But you can't rest inside my city
My city's so cold if you ain't dressed
And what they accept, better had a right address
Come to my city, certain colors can't step
And sadly I'm talking about the color of your skin
Sign my brother can't let you in
'Cause the property value might go down
To a level that's economically unacceptable
