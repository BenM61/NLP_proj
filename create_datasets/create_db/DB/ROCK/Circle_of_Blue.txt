Verse 1:
I love you and you love him and he loves somebody else
The three of us, so much in love
And yet, we're all on the shelf
'Round and 'round the wheel keeps turnin'
While our hearts are always yearnin'
For a dream that never will come true

Chorus:
A circle of blue, blue, blue
A circle of blue, blue, blue-hoo

Verse 2:
I wish somehow that there could be a way to work it all out
If one of us could realize just how to turn it about
'Round and 'round we keep on spinnin'
Love just can't find it's beginnin'
Lost inside a maze we can't get through

(repeat chorus)
Refrain: A circle of blue that's filled with only sorrow
A cirlce of blue with no hope for tomorrow

ba da da, ba da da
ba da da da ooh
(repeat)

Verse 3: 'Round and 'round the wheel keeps turnin'
While our hearts are always yearnin'
For the dreams that never will come true
(repeat chorus through fade-out)
