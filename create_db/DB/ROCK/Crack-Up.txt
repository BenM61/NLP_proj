So the mind won't lie
And the arm won't set
And the bright red eye isn't off you yet
So the words won't come
And the hand won't touch
And a midnight sun doesn't look like much
As an iris contracts, facing the day
I can tell you've cracked
Like a china plate

When the world insists
That the false is so
With a philippic as Cicero
"The tighter the fist
The looser the sand"

If I don't resist
Will I understand?
Ooh, ooh, ooh

All things change
Dividing tide far as I can see
All fades through but my light of you, as Ylajali

All I see, dividing tide
Rising over me
Ooh, wait
Oh, will you wait?
You, alive
You, alive
You, alive
