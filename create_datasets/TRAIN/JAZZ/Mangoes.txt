Mangos, papaya just nuts from the fire 
In my house of straw I have so much more 

Pie from the peach and I fix in the kitchen 
Each bite is just right for your appetite 

Now if you like-a the way I cook 
And if you like-a the way I look 
Then step inside my shady nook 
And you'll find mangos and papayas, anything your heart desires. 

Mangos, papayas, just nuts from the fire 
The food is so good, you will wanna stay 

Eat up and drink up and you'll think up 
The day when we say preacher man, okay 

	musical break 

Now if you like-a the way I cook 
And if you like-a the way I look 
Then step inside my shady nook 
And you'll find mangos and papayas, anything your heart desires. 

Mangos, papayas
