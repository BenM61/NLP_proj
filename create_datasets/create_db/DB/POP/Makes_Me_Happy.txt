Well hello let's go
Everybody must know
Love's in my heart like a bomb
It's blowing a song inside I'm singing
Sunshine that your bringing now
And it makes me happy

Listen to the radio playing back in stereo
Sounds like my favorite song
I'm humming along
My head is ringing

And I just can't stop singing now
'Cause it makes me happy
It makes me happy
You're everything I need

Handed from above
I can't get enough of your love
'Cause it makes me happy
It makes me happy

Living in a day-dream
I'll show you what it all means
Spending some more time in the sun
Let's get up and run it's just beginning

I just can't stop singing now
'Cause it makes me happy
Like a fantasy that you never find
Right in front of me all the time
And it makes me happy

I want it all but not too much
I wanna feel the way you touch me
I'm the kind of guy who's always there to come and find you
Save the rainy days for another time
I'm just here to say read between the lines
I'm so glad that your mine

'Cause you make me happy
You make me wanna sing
