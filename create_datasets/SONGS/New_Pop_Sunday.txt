Well she was
Clearly nervous
She asked me if I would drive
And I noticed
Then I knew
She had been drinking
And I always could
Read between the lines
There she was
Clearly nervous
Because there was something
That I had neglected
I was obvious
She could see right through me
Then we made love, ya we made love
So unprotected
Now here we are

It? a New Pop Sunday
We went too far
And now you?e gone
The brightest star
On my darkest Monday
Now here we are
It? a New Pop Sunday

Well she was
Clearly nervous
And I noticed she had
Something on her mind
But I was cool
Yeah I was cool
I knew what was coming
But doctors ain? really
Hard to find
Now here we are

It? a New Pop Sunday
We went too far
And now you?e gone
The brightest star
On my darkest Monday
Now here we are
Forever gone
Forever gone
