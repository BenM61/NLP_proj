Any day now, its gonna' start-my real life
And any day now, everything id gonna' be alright,
Any day, now, life's gonna' get real good.
And somehow, life'll be like I said it would.

Any day, now-mark my word!
Any day, now-I will be heard!
Any day, now-my ship
Will finally come in

Any day, now..I'm gonna' jump right in.
And any day ,now my destiny will begin.
And until then I'll just be here
Wasting my time,
But, don't you worry,
I'll be just fine

Any day, now-mark my word!
Any day, now-I will be heard!
Any day, now-my ship
Will finally come in
