I'm feeling perfectly out of place
And a little spinny three states away
I'm not allergic, just slightly phazed
And this attention, oh

Let's step it up is all
I didn't know your name so I guessed
And got it right or you were lying
I'll take it either way, I'm impressed

Or quickly fading and convinced that
We won't find this
We won't find anything anywhere that's better than us
I've got a lot of lines I could throw

But you were meant for something better
We're so divisible, running low
And that you're still here only shows that
You don't know me, you just know
I'm necessary to the process
We're not lonely, we're just tired
Of being here alone right now
We won't find this, we won't find 
Anything anywhere that's better than us
