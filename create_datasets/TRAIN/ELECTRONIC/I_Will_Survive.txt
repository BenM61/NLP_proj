Who's that gigolo on the street
With his hands in his pockets and his crocadile feet
Oh  I , I will survive
As long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive
Cuz I've got all
All my life to live
And I've got so much love to give
I'll survive, I'll survive
I will, I will survive
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye

I was afraid, I was petrified
Thinking I could never live without you by my side
And I spent so many nights
Thinking how you did me wrong
But I grew strong 
I learned how to get along

So you're back from outer space
I know I'm damned to find ya hear 
With that sad look upon your face
I shoulda changed all the locks
I shoulda made you leave your key
If I'da known for one second you'd be back to bother me

1 - 	Oh  now go
	Walk out the door
	Just turn around now
	Cuz you're not welcome anymore
	Weren't you the one that tried to hurt me with goodbye
	Did ya think I'd crumble
	Did you think I'd lay down and die

	Oh no not I
	I will survive
	Oh as long as I know how to love
	I know I'll stay alive
	Cuz I got all my life to live
	And I got all my love to give
	And I'll survive 

Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye

Took all the strength I had not to fall apart
Trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent so many nights feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high

And you see me somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person
That's still in love with you
And so you felt like dropping in
Thinking that I'd be fee
But now I'm saving all my loving
For someone who's loving me

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

If you wanna know
Do I need you
No no no no no no no no no no no
