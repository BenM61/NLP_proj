Cool like you
To be or not to be, I feel my blues
Cool like you
Maybe it's me, I just need something brand new

'Cause I'm so tired of talking through you
Uninspired
Can't ever let it show
Do what's required of you
Always got me wired
Don't think I'll ever

Know if I can leave when I want to
'Cause there's so many things that I could say to upset you
Maybe there's a way that I could be so that you knew
How it really feels in the space where I won't be
Cool like you

I won't sleep
You fabricate the things that you say to me, their needs
I can't keep
Putting up the front to pretend I'm happy

'Cause I'm so tired of talking through you
Uninspired
Can't ever let it show
Do what's required of you
Always got me wired
Don't think I'll ever

Know if I can leave when I want to
'Cause there's so many things that I could say to upset you
Maybe there's a way that I could be so that you knew
How it really feels in the space where I won't be
Cool like you

Don't be the one, won't be the one
Don't be the one, won't be the one
Don't be the one, won't be the one
Don't be the one

If I can leave when I want to
'Cause there's so many things that I could say to upset you
Maybe there's a way that I could be so that you knew
How it really feels in the space where I won't be
Cool like you

If I can leave when I want to
'Cause there's so many things that I could say to upset you
Maybe there's a way that I could be so that you knew
How it really feels in the space where I won't be
Cool like you
Cool like you
Cool like you
Cool like you
Cool like you
