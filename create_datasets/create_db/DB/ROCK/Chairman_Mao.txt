An early photograph
Of the young braid with the confident grin
Who is celebrating his first defeat
By clouching a haircut from his skull

The pig tail
In death of modern man
Like a young braid with a price on his head
Delilahs and Samsons

Stands the accused the symbol is clear
Cut from his skull
The long hair
The long hair

If this is the missing link
The threaded locks getting down to remain
Unable to avoid the sacrifice
The short back and side

The closest shave
The pig tail
Remember how it's done
First you must think and then you began

Seemingly retreating
The coiling spring is triggered to leave father ahead
The long march
