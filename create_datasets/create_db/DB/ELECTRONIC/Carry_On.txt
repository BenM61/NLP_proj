We sat on the edge
Of worlds today
The light of the sundown's on my fate
And we're tried and true
Our souls we bare
You promised to love me for some time

So don't let me fall, don't let me fall
Let the nighttime come this way
Don't let me fall, don't let me fall your way

And carry on
Just cross the waters, I'll be okay
'Cause I've been loved, I've been loved enough today
I know your fears are hidden well beneath your wind
So don't be long, leave me here, let me belong
Let me belong

In darkness, we rise
At twilight, we sway
Only then do we feel alive
The verve we once had
Lies in the bay
I hear it yelling for our lives

So don't let me fall, don't let me fall
Let the nighttime come this way
Don't let me fall, don't let me fall your way

And carry on
Just cross the waters, I'll be okay
'Cause I've been loved, I've been loved enough today
I know your fears are hidden well beneath your wind
So don't be long, leave me here, let me belong
Let me belong

So don't you let me fall, so don't you let me fall
Let the nighttime come its way

And carry on
Just cross the waters, I'll be okay
'Cause I've been loved, I've been loved enough today
I know your fears are hidden well beneath your wind
So don't be long, leave me here, let me belong
Let me belong
