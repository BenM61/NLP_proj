Strange as the night, but her love was all right
I know I want you by my side
She was strange as the night, but her love was all right
I know I want you by my side, listen

First time that I saw you was like you stepped out of a magazine
Your lips just a ruby red, but how many colors in your hair
Your style so divine; oh, how I wished you were mine, baby
Physical attraction, girl, from the look of your stance
And the way you look out of your eyes

My approach was soon to score 
That's why I'm knocking on your door 
Standin' there with roses in my hand 
Hopin' that you'd understand 
The way I feel 'bout you, baby 
And I wish you were mine, baby 

Physical attraction, girl, from the look of your stance 
And the way you look out of your eyes 

She was strange as the night, but her love was all right 
I know I want you by my side 
She was strange as the night, but her love was all right 
I know I want you by my side forever 

I want you by my side 
I need you to be my guide
