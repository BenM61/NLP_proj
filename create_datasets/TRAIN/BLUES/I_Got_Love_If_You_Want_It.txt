Got love if you want it, babe
Got love if you want it, babe
Got love if you want it
Got your love if you want it
Got love it you want it

We can rock awhile
We can rock awhile

Quit teasin' me, baby
Quit teasin' me, baby
A-wit' yo' fine bone frame
Wit' yo' fine bone frame
If you let me love you, baby
I'll be yo' lovin' man
I'll be yo' lovin' man

Now, here you come, baby
Now, here you come, baby
A-wit' ya head hung down
A-wit' ya head hung down
I know ya been followin'
The talks all over town
The talks all over town

Now, the next-do' neighbor
Now, the next-do' neighbor
Peepin' through the blinds
Peepin' through the blinds
Don't worry, nobody
That's all, they spyin'
That's all, they spyin'

I love you, little woman
I love you, little woman
Better than I do myself
Better than I do myself
But you mistreat me, baby
For someone else
For someone else
For someone else
For someone else
For someone else
For someone else
