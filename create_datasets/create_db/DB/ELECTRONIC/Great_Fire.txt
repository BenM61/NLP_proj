Great fire burning, you supplied the spark
Fires burning spreading through the ark
Animals are panicking
I'm animal and panicking

Your plans, a match on the tinder wood
You never spoke but I understood
Bring water
Eyes, bring water

Great fire burning through
Great fire burning through my house
Great fire burning through my house and heart

Great fire burning, all because of you
Fires burning spreading through the zoo
Animals are panicking
I'm animal panicking

No round of drinks can extinguish this
Feeling of love and engulfing bliss
Bring water
Eyes, bring water

Great fire burning through
Great fire burning through my house
Great fire burning through my house and heart

I've been in love before
But it's never been as hot as this
Smoke curling 'round the door
Memories of old loves crack and blister
Mister fireman bet you couldn't put me out if you tried

Your glance, a match on the tinder wood
You never spoke but I understood
Bring water
Eyes, bring water

Great fire burning
Great fire burning

Great fire burning through
Great fire burning through my house
Great fire burning through my house and heart

Great fire burning through
Great fire burning through my house
Great fire burning through my house and heart

Great fire burning through
Great fire burning through my house
Great fire burning through my house and heart

Great fire burning through
Great fire burning through my house
Great fire burning through my house and heart
