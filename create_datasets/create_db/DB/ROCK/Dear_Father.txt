Buried him in the cold wet ground
Familiar faces would have made him proud
The military and the working man
The history of the life he led

Can you feel that soil covering your coffin?
Can you feel? 
Can you feel that soil covering your coffin?
Can you feel? 
Can you feel that soil covering your coffin?
Can you feel? 

(So, what are you gonna do?) Be the hero that your father was
(So, what are you gonna do?) Be the man he made you to be
And you are your father's son
Dear father, dear father
Be the hero that your father was
Be the man he made you to be

The war torn stories that he told you
You've got a hell of a lot to live up to
An airborne man with a scar and a wound
Never make a promise that you can't prove

Dear father, dear father

(So, what are you gonna do?) Be the hero that your father was
(So, what are you gonna do?) Be the man he made you to be
And you are your father's son
Dear father, dear father
Be the hero that your father was
Be the man he made you to be

Where are you? Where are you?
You coward, you coward
Where are you? Where are you?
You coward, you coward
