Back in my schooldays, acting the fool days
One and one and one is three
And the man said, "Hey, come and cut yourself a piece of the big time"
Armor-clad forces, riding Trojan horses
Never made sense to me
I didn't want to be a part of the great debate on moonshine

"Stop, pay the price," they said to me
"Take this advice, you're out of your head"
I said, "Stop, hold the phone
This has to be cut to the bone
Too bad, I see red, I see red, I see red"

Sly man stumbles, twists and he tumbles
He always lands on his feet
And he sets his face towards the far horizon
Won't you come this way? Can't you go that way?
But his rhythm don't miss a beat
'Cause he's doing everything he can to keep surviving

"Stop, pay the price," they said to me
"Take this advice, you're out of your head"

"Stop, pay the price," they said to me
"Take this advice, you're out of your head"
I said, "Stop, hold the phone
This has to be cut to the bone
Too bad, I see red, I see red, I see red"

So who wants a riot? People should be quiet
Don't we give them good TV?
You can learn to love your lifetime of distraction
Nothing on the inside, nothing on the outside
All the way from A to Z
I can live without that kind of satisfaction

"Stop, pay the price," they said to me
"Take this advice, you're out of your head"
I said, "Stop, hold the phone
This has to be cut to the bone
Too bad, I see red, I see red, I see red"
