When she was just a girl she became a woman of the world
Soon there wasn't room enough for her
In between the bosoms of her family
She popped the cork, got on the Greyhound to New
York
Small-talked her way round just the sort
Of playboys' playground she'd once dreamed about

Maybe I love her, but I'm jealous of her
She's a woman of the world

She's a fake sure but she's a real fake
On the make making up for lost time
Just you wait hey, give the girl a break
And a fifty dollar bill will see to that
That ain't enough to feed the cat
Serve up the rats and super rats
Well they just get fatter while she fades away

Maybe I love her 'cause I'm jealous of her
She's a woman of the world
Maybe I hate her 'cause I didn't create her
It's human nature girl
Maybe I'll suffer just to be her lover
Just to be part of her world
Maybe I need her, because I want to be her
Baby can I be your girl?
Maybe I'll kill her, just trying to thrill her
If she don't kill me first

We're making eye-contact
Oh those hypnotic eyes attract such philanthropic flies
That's that, you cannot stop it so why the devil do you try?
