Before you speak the words 
So plain to see 
Upon your skin 
They sing 
They dance and spin 

So what pray tell 
Will save you now 
Here comes that cold sunrise 

And at the peak we reach 
To cue the strings 
They ring so sweet 
They lean 
And plead release 

So what pray tell 
Will save you now 
Here comes that cold sunrise
Here comes that cold sunrise
