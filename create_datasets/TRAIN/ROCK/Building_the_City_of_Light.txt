I set my shoulder to a brand new groove
Building the city of light
Something wonderful on the move
Building the city of light

I'm laying roots, planting seeds
Building the city of light
Grateful to give whatever it needs
Building the city of light

I'm using my head, using my heart
Getting the balance right
I've got the horse before the cart

I'm using bricks and sticks and stones
Building the city of light
And sweat and soul and blood and bones
Building the city of light

Technology, imagination
Building the city of light
Trust, belief and dedication
Building the city of light

I'm using my brains, using my balls
Keeping the goal in sight
Feeling at heart a part of it all

I'm writing songs, singing 'em out
Building the city of light
I live the things I'm singing about
Building the city of light

I'm working on myself and my stuff
Building the city of light
I just keep going when the going gets tough
Building the city of light

Facing my beast, facing my fears
Loving the darkness bright
I'm like a mirror when the shadow clears

Got no politics, got no price
Building the city of light
I don't need saved, I don't need advice
Building the city of light

I don't need freed, I'm already free
Building the city of light
All the answers I need are inside me
Building the city of light

All may change in the blink of an eye
All may change in the blink of an eye
