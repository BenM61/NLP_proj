Changed all my plans, look what you've done
My house is small, and there's only room for one
I know this game darling ' I don't want to play
Why can't I just walk away
Who's got the time, I need my space
Maybe someday in another time and place
Who's got the time, I need my space
Maybe someday in another time and place
Just turn around, I don't need this, not right now
But I'm falling anyhow

[Chorus:]
How does it feel? And it feels so fine
How do you know? 'cause I feel something deep down inside
What do you see? I see the light in his eyes
And I know what I know (I know it's clear)
Nobody's got to tell me so
See hearts never lie, the truth is in a sigh
I look in his eyes and I'm on fire
Logic prevail
I don't believe in fairy tales
Lately I find, I'm waiting by the phone
And I don't want to be alone
Feelings won't fade, doesn't matter what I say
Bit I'm falling deeper everyday
Ain't nobody got to tell me so
I know what I know
Ain't nobody got to let me so
I give up, I give in
Touch your body, taste your skin
The answer is the same again and again
How does it feel? And it feels so fine
How do you know? 'cause I feel something deep down inside
What do you see? I see the light in his eyes
And I know what I know (I know it's clear)
Ain't nobody got to tell me so
How does it feel? Said it feels so fine
How do you know? 'Cause I feel something deep down inside
What do you see? I see the light in his eyes
And I know what I know (I know it's clear)
What I know baby, baby
