If you need me, I will run to you
And if you call me out of the blue
I will run to catch you as you fall on me
And it's no surprise that you'll soon forget about me

So slow it down
Take it easy

If you want me
I will be right here
And if you love me
You will notice me here

But it's no surprise that your eyes are crying my name
And it's no surprise that your eyes are seeing the same

So slow it down
Take it easy

So slow it down
Take it easy
