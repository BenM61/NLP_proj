Out my window
The rain starts to fall
And the wind blows
Through an empty hall
In the mirror
Reflections of you

In the distance I hear a sound
Is that you coming around

Oh, what you gonna do
I think I should be with you
A love that's overdue
Oh I think I should be with you

Thought I saw you
In a stranger's face
Should I call you
Or should I walk away
'Round the corner
Is around the world

Is that you looking at me
Or am I living a dream

And when I'm lost in a dream
You are all I can see
All alone in the night I'm waiting for you
Every moment I'd die
Just to look in your eyes
The dream is alive

I'm waiting
Oh my, how I try
To make you see that
I should be with you
