I've got a fortune
A fortune in dreams
That's how I measure
My treasure of schemes

I'm never poor
If I can pretend
I wouldn't take a million
For the dreams that I spend

With only daydreams to keep me at night
I get along and I'm doin' alright

I haven't got a bankful
But I'm thankful to say
I've got a fortune in dreams put away
I've got a fortune in dreams

I've got a fortune
A fortune in dreams
That's how I measure
My treasure of schemes

I'm never poor
Not if I can pretend
And I wouldn't take a million
For the dreams that I spend

With only daydreams to keep me at night
I get along and I'm doin' alright

I've leaned to love the
Things in life that money can't buy
That's why I see the sun
And not the clouds up in the sky

I haven't got a bankful
But I'm thankful to say
I've got a fortune in dreams put away
I've got a fortune in dreams!
