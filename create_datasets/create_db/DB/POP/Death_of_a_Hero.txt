I was in Pittsburgh when I saw Superman in the backroom
He was doing lines or something in the bathroom
I barely recognized him at all
I saw him doing things you shouldn't do with all that power
I wish someone would have thrown him in the shower
I barely recognized him at all

That night I put my youth in a casket
And buried it inside of me
That night I saw through all the magic
Now I'm a witness to the death of a hero
I burned all the pictures in the attic
And threw away the magazines
That night I saw through all the magic
And now I'm a witness to the death of a hero

I tried to look away but you can't look away from a trainwreck
The things you said to girls, well they were shameless
I barely recognized him at all
I tried to help but he said he was just too far from saving
And nothing I could say was gonna change him
I barely recognized him at all

That night I put my youth in a casket
And buried it inside of me
That night I saw through all the magic
Now I'm a witness to the death of a hero
I burned all the pictures in the attic
And threw away the magazines
That night I saw through all the magic
And now I'm a witness to the death of a hero

The death of a hero, he couldn't be saved
Now I'm cutting the grass and I'll cover his grave
I'll cover his grave
The death of a hero, I'm turning the page
Now I'm cutting the grass and I'll cover his grave
I'll cover his grave

That night I put my youth in a casket
And buried it inside of me
That night I saw through all the magic
Now I'm a witness to the death of a hero
I burned all the pictures in the attic
And threw away the magazines
That night I saw through all the magic
And now I'm a witness to the death of a hero
