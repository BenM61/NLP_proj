The snow across the old white fields
I have no care so long as you're safe
And it's been settling down quite thick this year
She was a teacher to me, I remember when she loved me

We daydream alone, forgetting the one place we call home
Why would you do this? Without leaving me with one more kiss
That's all died

I miss the way you paint square flowers
And I love the way your grace is your face
I miss the way you taste
(I miss the way you taste)
When I get lost in myself

We've been drinking it dry for quite a while
I have no home, only you
One by one the troops fall down, I'm daydreaming
I remember when she left me

I heard it was murder, she laughed and she laughed till it hurt her
He's no longer weeping, the secrets no longer worth keeping
That's all died

I miss the way you paint square flowers
And I love the way your grace is your face
I miss the way you taste
(I miss the way you taste)
When I get lost in myself

Does she forgive you?
(Does she forgive you?)
Does she still believe in you?
(Does she believe?)
Does she forgive you this time?
(Does she forgive?)
Does she still believe in you?
(When all is all said and done)

Does she forgive you this time?
(Does she forgive?)
Does she still believe in you?

Does she forgive you?
Does she still believe in you?
When all is all said and done
