Listen closely it's all around.
The way to make it I've always found is to;
Turn the thoughts inside
Steal the strength that hides.

Follow feelings to make the climb.
Intuitions can tow the line, through the;
Bars that would not break
To the great escape

All alone in a change, may be a lonely place.
Everything is so strange, in this race...

Time will tell, stand and begin to fight for yourself
Time will tell, anyway
Time will tell, only the strong can take it so well
Time will tell, anyway - Only time will tell.

Take a flame to ignite a try.
Indecision won't satisfy, all the the;
Choices must be made.
When your hand is laid.

In the end there may be some pain.
Before you're back on your feet again, but it;
Always comes out right
When you've won your fight

All alone in a change, may be a lonely place.
Everything is so strange, in this race...

Time will tell, stand and begin to fight for yourself
Time will tell, anyway
Time will tell, only the strong can take it so well
Time will tell, anyway

Time will tell, stand and begin to fight for yourself
Time will tell, anyway
Time will tell, only the strong can take it so well
Time will tell, anyway - Only time will tell.

Only time will tell
Only time will tell
Only time will tell
