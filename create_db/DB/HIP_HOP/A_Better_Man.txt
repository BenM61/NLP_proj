Hello, hello it's me again
You're still not home
'cause if you were, it's after 4 am
I wouldn't be here alone, see
God, give me the strength and the courage I need
What my heart lives for, have to let it be

But it's okay, I understand 
(You've got to leave)
I don't cry no more baby, what for? 
(You don't shed a tear for me)
See, I was blind but now I see
There's gotta be a better man for me
There's gotta be a better man for me

Hello, oh no not this again, I'll be counting down
Your bags are packed and they're at the door
I gotta get used to not having you around
God, give me the strength and the courage I need
To move forward with my life, have to let him be

But it's okay, I understand 
(You've got to leave)
I don't cry no more baby, what for? 
(You don't shed a tear for me)
See, I was blind but now I see
There's gotta be a better man for me
There's gotta be a better man for me

There's gotta be a better man
Ooh, God, hear me now
'cause God, give me the strength and the courage I need
'cause I know now, baby
There's gotta be a better man for me

You've got to leave
You don't shed a tear for me
See I was blind, but now I see
There's gotta be a better man for me
There's gotta be a better man for me

See I'm tired of your lying, and I'm tired of tryin'
(You've got to leave)
I don't cry no more baby, what for? 
(You don't shed a tear for me)
See, I was blind, but now I see
There's gotta be a better man for me
Somewhere out there, baby
There's gotta be a better man for me
Gotta be a better man, oh yeah
