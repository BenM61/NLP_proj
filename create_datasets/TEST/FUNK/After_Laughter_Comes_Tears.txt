After laughter comes tears
After your laughter there will be tears

When you're in love, you're happy
When your in a arm, you gaze
This doesn't last always

After your laughter there will be tears

My friends all say, don't try to hold it in
But i can't let that guy know how i feel
I'll try to hold back my, my, my tears
But they keep say

After your laughter oh, oh, oh

I'll try to hide, hide my sorrows
I wonder can i hold them till tomorrow
Maybe ill hold them for a year
But they keep say

After your laughter
Now you will see those wet little tears

After your laughter
A little biddy tear will look climb into your eye
