I was living in the belly of a shark
Seen what he was eating all the time
She pulled me out with her pirate sense of duty oh
She said you've been living off the dark end blend
Now it's time to come out my friend, you thought
Oh I'll never see the light but you were wrong
You just became the light

'Cause I am a ghost boy I don't 
Scare and I don't get no bellyaches
And I'll be eating sparrows 
Sitting on top of a tree
And as the days go by won't
You show me where to get them bellyaches
Or I'll be eating marrow
Straight from the bone

Those days I had a coronary taste
Falling from the tip of my tongue
She was looking for a little fun
And me I was the only one oh she said:
Big sewers filled with little kids,
West side story be the story of bids that go 
High till they brake the sky.
They make bible stones seem old 
Now all that can save me
Is my own rabies 
So I bite my own self
And I quiet down like stealth again
All that can save me
Is my own rabies
So I bite my own self
And I quiet down like stealth bombers

'Cause I am a ghost boy I don't 
Scare and I don't get no bellyaches
And I'll be eating sparrows 
Sitting on top of a tree
And as the days go by won't
You show me where to get them bellyaches
Or I'll be eating marrow
Straight from the bone
