There's a crooked street
In Houston town
It's a well born path
I've traveled down
Now there's ruin in my name
I wish I never got off the train
I wished I'd listened
To the words you said

Don't go down to Fannin Street
Don't go down to Fannin Street
Don't go down to Fannin Street
You'll be lost and never found
You can never turn around
Don't go down to Fannin Street

Once I held you in my arms
I was sure
But I took that silent stare
Through the guilded door
The desire to have much more
All the glitter and the roar
I know this is where
The sidewalk ends

Don't go down to Fannin Street
Don't go down to Fannin Street
Don't go down to Fannin Street
You'll be lost and never found
You can never turn around
Don't go down to Fannin Street

When I was young
I thought only of getting out
I said goodbye to my street
Goodbye to my house
Give a man gin, give a man cards
Give an inch he takes a yard
And I rue the day
That I stepped off this train

Don't go down to Fannin Street
Don't go down to Fannin Street
Don't go down to Fannin Street
You'll be lost and never found
You can never turn around
Don't go down to Fannin Street
