I got my eyes on you baby from yea feet up to ya head 
A perfect night it'd be if I could see ya in my bed 
I wont beat around the bush, I'm a be real instead 
You need a thug in ya life, is you down or you scared? 

[Frankie J] 
Everybody knows when I step in the club 
Girls see me and they wanna show me love 
I got my chain on, with my shades on 
Rockin' designer shoes and I sold a million 
So many girls, but theres one that caught my eye 
Pretty lady so fine she blew my mind, oh my, cause shes the one for me 

[Chorus] 
Ive been around the world, and seen so many girls 
But none can compare cause I cant keep my eyes off that girl 
She got a bill and a face like a supermodel 
And her body built just like a coke bottle 
But none can compare cause I cant keep my eyes off that girl 
Shake it shake it shake it shake it shake it shake it snap! 
Shake it shake it shake it shake it shake it bring it back! 
But none can compare cause I cant keep my eyes off that girl 

[Frankie J] 
I think she knows that I'm tryin' to get at her 
I'm a go ahead and try to put in work 
Whats your name, whats your number can I hit you up 
If you digging what I'm sayin' let me know whats up 
So baby let me know if I can take you home (take you home) 
I just wanna be somewhere where were alone alone 
Cause you're the one for me 

[Chorus]

Welcome to Miami, I've seen so many mommy's 
Overseas the girls I've seen but none compare to you oh baby

Slim Thug 
Now I done been around the whole world played with the best of em 
But by far baby girl got the rest of em 
Shes so blessed from her back to her chest 
Got a player on the quest to try to get her out her dress 
Yes, I'm feelin' like I just hit the lotto 
A caramel model shaped like a coke bottle 
I'm a mack on attack like who the hell is that girl 
When you leave I'm tryin' to be where you at girl 

[Chorus]

She got a bill and a face like a super model 
And her body built just like a coke bottle 
But none can compare cause I cant keep my eyes off that girl 
Shake it shake it shake it shake it shake it shake it snap! 
(Come on come on come on come on baby) 
Shake it shake it shake it shake it shake it bring it back! 
(Come on come on come on your so sexy) 
But none can compare cause I cant keep my eyes off that girl 
Shake it shake it shake it shake it shake it shake it snap! 
(I love the way your body moves) 
Shake it shake it shake it shake it shake it bring it back! 
(I love your sexy attitude) 
But none can compare cause I cant keep my eyes off that girl
