You know, you must take a look at the new land
The swimming pool and the teeth of your friend
The dirt in my hand
You know, you must take a look at me
Baby, baby
I know that's the way
You know, you must try the new ice cream flavor
Do me a favor, look at me closer
Join us and go far
And hear the new sound of my bossa nova
Baby, baby
It's been a long time
You know, it's time now to learn Portuguese
It's time now to learn what I know
And what I don't know
And what I don't know
And what I don't know
I know, with me everything is fine
It's time now to make up your mind
We live in the biggest city of South America
Of South America
Of South America
Look here, read what I wrote on my shirt
Baby, baby
I love you
You do
