It's been a long time comin'
It's goin' to be a long time gone
Appears to be a long time,
Yes, a long, long, log time
Before the dawn

Turn, turn any corner
Hear, you must hear what the people say,
You know there's something that's goin' on here,
That surely, surely, surely won't stand the light of day
And it appears to be a long,
Such a long, long, long time before the dawn
Speak out, you got to speak out against
The madness, you got to speak your mind,
If you dare

But don't try to get yourself elected
If you do you had better cut your hair
'Cause it appears to be a long time,
Before the dawn

It's been a long time comin',
It's been a long time gone
But you know, the darkest hour,
Is always just before the dawn
And it appears to be a long time,
Such a long, long, long time before the dawn
