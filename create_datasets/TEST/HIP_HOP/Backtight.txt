Looking back at all I put you through
Too much of a thug nigga to tell you I love you
I know I made mistakes
Here hoping and prayin that it aintoo late
Thought I had my game tight
Thought I had it locked down, knowing shit wasn't right
Now you want to blow
Before I let you go
Something you just gotta know

Ain't nothing stopping me from getting backtight with you
Go head and trip you got the right to
If I gotta roll up my sleeves and fight for you
I'll stand outside in the rain all night for you

Ain't nothing stopping me from getting backtight with you
Go head and trip you got the right to
If I gotta roll up my sleeves and fight for you
I'll stand outside in the rain all night

Three months three weeks two days its the same shit
Shorty she ain't haven't it
Back then I wasn't serious
Makin' so much paper kept me curious
Chickens cluckin' everywhere I didn't care
Thinking to myself that you'd always be here
Instead of makin' love to you lady
I would rather be out pushin' my Mercedes

Ain't nothing stopping me from getting backtight with you
Go head and trip you got the right to
If I gotta roll up my sleeves and fight for you
I'll stand outside in the rain all night for you

Ain't nothing stopping me from getting backtight with you
Go head and trip you got the right to
If I gotta roll up my sleeves and fight for you
I'll stand outside in the rain all night for you

If the sun was to fall and the stars was to lose their shine
Id be content with it all as long as your by my sidegirl
Through the good through the bad through it all gonna need your back
Ill always be with you just want to please you

Ain't nothing stopping me from getting backtight with you
Go head and trip you got the right to
If I gotta roll up my sleeves and fight for you
I'll stand outside in the rain all night for you

Ain't nothing stopping me from getting backtight with you
Go head and trip you got the right to
If I gotta roll up my sleeves and fight for you
I'll stand outside in the rain all night for you
