Baby, you mistreated me all the time
Baby, you mistreated me all the time
Yes, you know I hope some day, baby
That you will change your mind

Baby, now what wrong have I done
Baby, now what wrong have I done
You try to mistreat me, baby
When I try to have my fun

Baby, it's all comin' back to you
Baby, it's all comin' back to you
You're gonna be sorry, darlin'
That you treat me like you do

Baby, got to go and leave you here
Baby, got to go and leave you here
But maybe some day, baby
You will feel my care
