Grab your coat honey, grab your hat
This train is leavin' an it ain't comin' back
Don't need a ticket can't you understand
You're on your way to the promised land
It's overdue, but now the time is right, yeah
It's up to you, to make it real, so take me

Take me back to paradise, (paradise) oh, oh
Take me back to paradise, (paradise) oh, oh

Old Saint Peter at the pearly gate
Sayin', "Hurry up boy or you're gonna be late"
Take your mind off your worries for a moment or two
You gotta rock to the rhythm, it ain't hard to do
'Cause what you see, I know you're gonna like, yeah
It's up to you, to make it real, to take me

Take me back to paradise, (paradise) oh, oh
Take me back to paradise, (paradise) oh, yeah

Oh, when it's out of reach, it's just another beach
In another town
You get your feet back on the ground
You worked all your life, you ain't satisfied
With a thing you've found
When will you realize it'll come around?

Pack your bags baby, get your things
You'll never know what tomorrow brings
Mind your step and watch what you say
Before you know, you'll be on your way
It's overdue, but now the time is right, yeah
It's up to you, to make it real, so take me

Take me back to paradise, (paradise) uh huh
Take me back to paradise, (paradise) oh
Take me back to paradise, (paradise) oh
Won't you take me back to paradise, (paradise) oh
Yo! Take me back to paradise!
