Today I Felt a Pain Inside My Heart
The Thought of Leaving You Was On My Mind
If I've Been Deceiving You, It's All Because I'm Blind
Cause I Care For You More Than You Know
Although My Heart Says Go
Today I Saw the Tears Inside Your Eyes
The Thought of Hurting You, I'd Rather Die
If I'm Deserting You, I Don't Mean to Make You Cry
Cause I Care For You More Than You Know
Although My Heart Says

How Do You Tell the One
You Love Goodbye For Good
Or Even Know If You Should
And How Do You Say the Words
You Thought You Never Could
When You Promised Her
That You Love Was True
Said I'd Never Think, of Leaving You
Oh How Can Love, Be Cruel

Today I Felt a Pain Inside My Heart
The Thought of Leaving You Had Crossed My Mind
If I've Been Deceiving You, It's Only Cause I'm Blind
Cause I Care For You More Than You Know
Although My Heart Says Go

How Do You Tell the One
You Love Goodbye For Good
Or Even Know If You Should
And How Do You Say the Words
You Thought You Never Could
When You Promised Her
That You Love Was True
Said I'd Never Think, of Leaving You
Oh How Can Love, Be Cruel

How Can You Live a Lie
When You Know It's Wrong
And You Know It's Not Right
When You Say You Do
But You Know You Don't
When You Say You Will
But You Know That You Won't
When You're Not Alive
You Should Let It Die
Just Let Go, Just Let Go, of the Pain Inside
Tell Me How Do You Know
Tell Me How to Let Go
Tell Me How, How, How

How Do You Tell the One
You Love Goodbye For Good
Or Even Know If You Should
And How Do You Say the Words
You Thought You Never Could
When You Promised Her
That You Love Was True
Said I'd Never Think, of Leaving You
Oh How Can Love, Be Cruel
