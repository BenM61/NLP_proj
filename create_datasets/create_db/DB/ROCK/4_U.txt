This shit right here is for you

All your faces I can see
You all think it's about me

I'm about to break, this is my fate
Am I still damned to my life, of misery and hate?

You will never know

What I've done for you

What you know

Got me through 

I'd do it for you

I could have, never loved
If it wasn't, for you
