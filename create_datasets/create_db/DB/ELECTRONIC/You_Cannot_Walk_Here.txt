You Cannot Walk Here, You Cannot Walk Here
I've Been Watching You All The Way
Where The Hell Do You Think You Are?
You Cannot Walk Here, You Cannot Walk Here

You're On My Land, Soiling My Ground
You Cannot Walk Here, You Cannot Walk Here
What You Say I Don't Understand
Beware I Have My Gun At Hand

You Cannot Walk Here, You Cannot Walk Here
You Want A Shelter From The Rain
I Don't Want You To Stay
Wrong Way! Dead End! No Entrance!

There Is Nothing For You Here!
Wrong Way! Dead End! No Entrance!
Wrong Way! Dead End! Is It Clear?
Crawl Back To Where You Come From!

Hey Stranger You're Not Welcome Here!
You Cannot Stay Here, You Cannot Stay Here
I Don't Want To Be Seen With You
What Would My Neighbors Say?

You Cannot Stay Here, You Cannot Stay
For We Just Might Get Used To Know Each Other
Maybe Become Friends And I Don't Want That
And I Don't Want That

There Is No Bed For You Tonight
No Room Inside For Someone Like You
For Someone Like You
You Cannot Stay Here, You Cannot Stay!

Wrong Way! Dead End! No Entrance!
There Is Nothing For You Here!
Wrong Way! Dead End! No Entrance!
Wrong Way! Dead End! Is It Clear?

Crawl Back To Where You Come From!
Hey Stranger You're Not Welcome Here!
The Spring Has Gone, My Well Is Dry
There's No More Water In My Jars

That's Why...
You Cannot Drink Here, You Cannot Drink Here
My Wine Has Turned To Vinegar
The Well Is Dry, The Spring Has Gone

You Cannot Drink Here Nor Even Eat
You Say You're Starving, You Say You're Starving
But There Is Nothing Left For You
I Have A Family To Feed, My Granaries Are Empty

You Cannot Eat Here, You Cannot Eat Here
You Cannot Eat!
You Cannot Walk Here, You Cannot Walk Here
This Place Is Not Your Paradise

Go To Hell, Shrivel Up And Die
You Cannot Walk Here, You Cannot Walk Here
You Cannot Walk Here!
You Cannot Walk Here!
