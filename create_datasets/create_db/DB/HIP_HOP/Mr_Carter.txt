Yo!
Yo Joint Inf' did this
This right here is crazy
I-I feel big! You-know what I'm
Not-not "Big" in the sense of weight, 
You know like gaining weight or, nothing like that
But like colossal! you know what I mean? Like 

I heard you were looking for me

(Hey Mr. Carter)
Hello!
(Tell me where you been?)
You know!
(They been asking, they been searching, they been wondering why)
Yeah, Ha-ha, ha I know!
(Hey Mr. Carter)
Hey, Hello!
(Tell me where you been?)
Shit, you know! 
(They been asking, they been searching, they been wondering why)

Yeah
To you
Forever, from me to you
I heard somebody said church, I'm a need a suit
I'm a need a coup
I won't need a roof
Flier than Beetle juice
Beetle juice
Beetle juice
I got the floor, I'm tryna see the roof
Didn't wear a bulletproof
So I got shot and you can see the proof
Blind eyes could look at me and see the truth
Wonder if Stevie do?
But I'm a leave it to
God, not Beaver
Neither
You
Cause I'm a murder, why I kill ol' and even you?
Man, I got Summer hating on me cause I'm hotter than the sun
Got Spring hating on me cause I ain't never sprung
Winter hating on me cause I'm colder than y'all
And I would never, I would never, I would never fall
I'm being hated on by the seasons
So f*ck y'all who hating for no reason!

(Hey Mr. Carter)
I am him!
(Tell me where you been?)
Around the world and I'm back again!
(They been asking, they been searching, they been wondering why)
Who's been asking about me? In case you're wondering!
(Hey Mr. Carter)

(Tell me where you been?)
Around the world and now I'm back again!

Who's been asking about me? In case you're wondering!
Ha!

Yeah
I been in and out the bank, bitch!
While all y'all asshole niggas been on the same shit
I flush, and watch it go down the drain quick
Two words you will never hear, "Wayne Quit?"
Cause Wayne win, and they lose
I call them April Babies, cause they fools
And when they snooze,
We up!
Feet up!
Like a paraplegia
Or paraplegic
Or parallel park
In a red and yellow thing old school Atlanta Hawk
Like I'm from Collipark
But I'm from Hollygrove!
Now all my Bloods scream "Soowoo!" and "Da da dooh!"
I know my role
And I play it well
And I wear it well
On my Libra Scale
I suck a pussy
F*ck a pussy
Leave it there
(Long hair don't even care)

Young!
(Hey Mr. Carter)

(Hey Mr. Carter)

(Tell me where you been?)
Around the world and now I'm back again!
(They been asking, they been searching, they been wondering why)
Who's been asking about me? In case you're wondering!

Ch-yeah!
I'm right, cheah
In my chair
With my crown, with my dear
Queen Bee, as I share
Mic time, with my heir
Young Carter
Go farther
Go further
Go harder
Is that not
Why we came? And if not,
Then why bother?
Show no mercy in Murcielaga's
I'm far from being the bastard that Marcy had fathered
Now my name's being mentioned with the martyrs
The Biggie's and the Pac's and the Marley's and the Marcus's
Govi
Got me
A Molotov Cocktail
Flow
Even if you box well
Can't stop the blows
(Kaboom)
The Roc Boy in the room
The dope, boy just came off the spoon
Also
I'm so
Fly I'm on auto
Pilot
While guys just
Stare at my wardrobe
I see Euro's
That's right, plural
I took so much change
From this rap game
It's your go!
(Hey Mr. Carter)
Young!

"It's my go"
Yeah
And I'm a go
So
Opposite of soft
Off
The Richter
Hector Camacho Man Randy Savage
Far from average
Above status
Quo
Flow
So
Pro
I know
I ride slow
And when I pass
They say "what up, killer man?" Stop bringing up my past!
And next time you mention Pac, Biggie,
And Jay-Z
Don't forget Weezy
Baby!

(Hey Mr. Carter)
Amen
(Tell me where you been?)
Ya!

(Hey Mr. Carter)
Ay Man

Weezy! Baby

(Hey Mr. Carter)
(Tell me where you been?)
I been hustling
(They been asking, they been searching, they been wondering why)
Hustling hard 
Cheah

(Hey Mr. Carter)
And I swear to everything, when I leave this Earth
(Tell me where you been?)
It's gonna be on both feet
Never knees
In the dirt
(They been asking, they been searching they been wondering why)
You can try me fuckable, but when I squeeze it hurts
Fine
We lose two lives
Yours and mines
Gimme any amount of time
Don't let Mrs. Carter
Grieve
At the funeral parlor
Dripping tears down my sleeve
Gimme any amount of time
Don't let Mrs. Carter grieve
