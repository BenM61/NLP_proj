You will like the folks you meet in our town,
The folks you'll meet on any street in our town.
Pick out any cottage, white or brown.
They're all so appealing, with that "lived-in" feelin'.

You will like the shady lanes in our town.
The music of the passing trains in our town.
You will lose your heart, I promise you,
In this, our "two by four" town,
"Welcome" on the door town,
If you'll make it your town, too.

(Musical interlude)
You will lose your heart, I promise you,
In this, our "two by four" town,
"Welcome" on the door town,
If you'll make it your town, too.
