Magic man said
"You know my dear
You are living inside a dream
Believing the things I do
Are what they seem
Life is a trick that runs too quick
For a volunteer from the crowd
The volunteers only see
What's been allowed"
The players practice to deceive
With paper flowers none perceive
Disappearing down the top hat corridors
Art and illusion
The magic show won't let you go
Magicians rehearse
Their sleights of hand
They slip money bags up their sleeves
They saw you in half
And then they turn to leave
Tricks of the trade
The ball games played
By the jugglers centre stage
Carefully handed down from age to age
Conclusions made conclusions leapt
Impressions lost and overstepped
Shadows hide the truth
With nobody the wiser

[Chorus]
They're only trying to tell your lies
Trying to make you compromise
To leave reality completely up to them

[Chorus]
