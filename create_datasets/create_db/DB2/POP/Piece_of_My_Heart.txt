Come on come on
Come on come on
Didn't I make you feel
You were the only man
Mmmm and didn't I give you everything
That a woman possibly can
You know I did
Each time I tell myself
That I think I've had enough
I'm gonna show you
A woman can be tough

I want you to come on come on
Come on come on hey (take it)
Take another little piece of my heart now baby (break it)
Break another little piece of my heart now baby (have a)
Have another little piece of my heart now baby
You know you've got it
If it makes you feel good

You're out on the street looking good
Deep down in your heart
I guess you know it just ain't right
Now you can hear me when you cry
I cry all the time
Each time I tell myself that I can't stand the pain
But when you hold me in your arms
And I feel it once again

I want you to come on come on
Come on come on hey (take it)
Take another little piece of my heart now baby (break it)
Break another little piece of my heart now baby (have a)
Have another little piece of my heart now baby
You know you've got it
If it makes you feel good

You know you've got it
If it makes you feel good
If it makes you feel
you're out on the street
And deep down in your heart I guess
You know it just ain't right
Yeah yeah yeah

I want you to come on come on
Come on come on hey (take it)
Take another little piece of my heart now baby (break it)
Break another little piece of my heart now baby (have a)
Have another little piece of my heart now baby
You know you've got it
If it makes you feel good

You know you've got it yeah
You know you've got it
Take another little piece of my heart now baby

Break another piece break another piece
Of my heart again
You know you've got it

If it makes you feel good
