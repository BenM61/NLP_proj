Inside himself,
He runs to look in the mirror
And the face that stares right back
Has never been any clearer
But look at the doubt in his eyes
He's not the one to blame
It was a different man, no he's never been here
You can be so close, you can be so near
It was a different man, playing different cards
You can be so soft, you can be so hard

Inside himself,
He follows the wrong directions
Perfect English words all right
But with the wrong inflections
But look at the dust at his feet
He's not the one she loves
It was a different man, no he's never been found
You can be so up, you can be so down
It was a different man, no he's never been there
You can be halfway, you can be all there

Inside himself,
He thinks that he looks the same
And the mind that thinks it all out
Never noticed any change
But look at the doubt in his eyes
He's not the one to blame
