Hot milk
Mm, tweak my nipple
Champagne and ripple
Shamans go cripple
My sales go triple
We drop lobotomy beats
Evaporated meats 
On high-tech streets
We go solo
Dance floors and talk shows
Hot dogs, 'No Doz'
Hot sex in back rows

I want to know what makes you scream
Be your twenty million dollar fantasy
Treat you real good
Expensive jeans
Hollywood freaks on the Hollywood scene

Touch it real good if you want a piece
Party people know I'm that type of freak

People look so snooty
Take pills make them moody
Automatic bzooty
Zero to tutti fruitti
Sex in the halls
Niagara Falls
Local shopping malls receive
Anonymous calls
Hot like a cheetah
Neon mamacita
Eat at tacoria
Pop lockin' beats from Korea
Looking like jail bait 
Selling lots of real estate
Looking like a hot date
Banging like and 808

Do you want to feel this?
Do you want to feel this?

Norman Schwartzkoff
Something tells me you want to go home
Champagne, Bibles
Custom clothes you own
Calling up from special area codes
Hollywood nun with the Hollywood phones
I got nothing to do nowhere to go
I'll tell you what you want
If you want to know
Satin sheets
Tropical oils
Turn up the heat
Till the swimming pool boils
Let all the neighbors
Read it in the papers
Making all those gentlemen cry
Realistic tears

Jockin' my Mercedes
Probably have my baby
Shop at Old Navy
He wish he was a lady
