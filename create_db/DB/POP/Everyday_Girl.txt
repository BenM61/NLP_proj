Oh oh

Don't need a justify, who I am, what I am, I just want to be me,
Don't want to live a lie, who I am what I am, I cannot make you see,
I'm just myself like no one else, I've got to walk my own way

I'm not your everyday girl, let me show you my world, I am ready and nothing can stop me now,
I'm not your everyday girl, be a part of my world, are you ready, come on let me show you how

Let me do my thing, I'm giving up, giving in, they can't keep me down, don't want to live a lie like giving up, giving in, let me show who I am,
I'm just myself like no one else, I've got to go my own way

I'm not your everyday girl, let me show you my world, I am ready and nothing can stop me now,
I'm not your everyday girl, be a part of my world, are you ready, come on let me show you how

No no I won't change, I stay the same, no matter what they tell me, I'm just myself like no one else, I've got to walk my own way,

Oh oh

I'm not your everyday girl (your girl), let me show you my world, I am ready and nothing can stop me now (Oh Baby),
I'm not your everyday girl, be a part of my world, are you ready, come on let me show you how

Oh oh

I'm not your everyday girl, let me show you my world, I am ready and nothing can stop me now,
I'm not your everyday girl, be a part of my world, are you ready, come on let me show you how

I'm not your everyday girl!
