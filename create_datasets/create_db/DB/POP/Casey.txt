Driving in your car
With the windows down
And the beat up stereo
Struggle with this town
'cause you love to hate it
And hate it to let it go

And we're all alone
And so tired of being
Underrated
So don't take me home
'cause I feel alive
When you come and save me

A yellow car
Speeding down the South side freeway
We'll rewrite this movie
Make it end like we want it to

And Casey
When you go
Can you come and find me
Wanna be beside you
When you leave this town
I've been waving goodbye
Pretending not to cry
I want to be someone
If you take me away
All the pain will change
Into a memory,
Of when we were amazing

1989
Summer had hit
But it was not moving
What is it with this town?
Every time we win
It just feels like losing
We were never gonna fit in
I was a mixed up kid
And you were my sanity

In a yellow car
We don't even have to go far
'cause that song you're playing
Sounds like peace on the radio

And Casey
When you go
Can you come and find me
Wanna be beside you
When you leave this town
I've been waving goodbye
Pretending not to cry
I want to be someone
If you take me away
All the pain will change
Into a memory
Of when we were amazing
When we were amazing

I know things will change
Casey stay the same
Take me away
Oh, we don't have to go far
Yeah, we don't have to go far
I know

Casey
When you go
Can you come and find me
Wanna be beside you
When you leave this town
I've been waving goodbye
Pretending not to cry
I want to be someone
If you take me away
All the pain will change
Into a memory
Of when we were
When we were

Casey
When you go
Can you come and find me
Wanna be beside you
When you leave this town
I've been waving goodbye
Pretending not to cry
I want to be someone
If you take me away
All the pain will change
Into a memory
Of when we were amazing
When we were

Driving in your car
With the windows down
And the beat up stereo
Oh, oh

I wanna
I'm gonna
I wanna
Be someone
I wanna
I'm gonna
I wanna
Be someone

(I will run to you
I will come to you
I will run to you
I will come to you)

Come on and get me
Come on and rescue me

(I will run to you
I will come to you
I will run to you
I will come to you)

Coming through the sky
Like a satellite
Like a radio wave
A meteorite
