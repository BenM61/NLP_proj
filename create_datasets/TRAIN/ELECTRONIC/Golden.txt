Ok (ay) Oh (oh) Hey (ay-yay)
Yeah...
Oh... 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah...

I'm taking my freedom
Pulling it off the shelf
Puttin' it on my chain
Wearing it 'round my neck
I'm taking my freedom
Puttin' it in my car
Wherever I choose to go
It will take me far

I'm living my life like it's golden
Living my life like it's golden
Living my life like it's golden
Living my life like it's golden
Living my life like it's golden
(golden)
Living my life like it's golden
Living my life like it's golden
Living my life like it's golden
Living my life like it's golden
(golden)

I'm taking my own freedom
Puttin' it in my song
Singing loud and strong
Proving all day long
I'm takin' my freedom
Puttin' it in my stroll
I'll be hop-steppin' why'all
Lettin' the joy unfold

I'm living my life like it's golden
Living my life like it's golden
Living my life like it's golden
Living my life like it's golden
Living my life like it's golden
(golden)
Living my life like it's golden
Living my life like it's golden
Living my life like it's golden
Living my life like it's golden
(golden)

I'm holdin' on to my freedom
'Can take it from me
I was born in-to it, it comes naturally
I'm strumming my own freedom
Playing the god in me
Representing his glory
Hope he's proud of me...

I'm living my life like it's golden
Living my life like it's golden
Living my life like it's golden
Living my life like it's golden
Living my life like it's golden
(golden)
Living my life like it's golden
Living my life like it's golden
Living my life like it's golden
Living my life like it's golden
(golden)

Hope he's proud of me...

Living my life like it's 
Golden, golden, golden,
Golden, golden, golden,
Living my life like it's 
Golden, golden, golden,
Golden, golden, golden,
Living my life like it's 
Golden, golden, golden...
