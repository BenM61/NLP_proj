Hey, hey

Hey

It's just a day, a day, a devil day
Things don't really seem like they are goin' my way
I got a girlfriend in Virginia, I'm in Californ-yay
Said "I know you probably cheated, I got something to say."

I got a new guy, that's what she said
Now, I never knew, I'd feel like I'm dead
Cause I lost my bottom lady for a one-night stand
She said: 
I thought that you should know that I don't wanna be friends.

She said I don't wanna be your friend,
She said I don't wanna be your friend, 
She said I, don't wanna be your friend,
Well baby I don't ever wanna see you again. 
Hey.

And little lady C'mon (On)
C'mon (On)
C'mon (On)
C'mon (On)

I send a text a dozen times, but you don't read it no more
You always say what's on your mind,
so why don't you pick up the phone?
I play the game, you change the rules,
is that the status you write?
I live in pain, you are my happiness, I post in reply
You see I know this ya type, I cheat and know it ain't right
You want revenge, but no forgiveness,
but I don't think it's fair
I see you out with other niggas and I know you don't care
I just hope I still can get since you won't be my friend
Okay.

She said I don't wanna be your friend,
She said I don't wanna be your friend, 
She said I, don't wanna be your friend,
Well baby I don't ever wanna see you again
Hey.

And Little la
