La, la, la
La, la, la
Lo, la, la, la
I'm so lonely tonight

If I could only hold you once more
If I could only kiss you once more
If I could only see you one more time
One more time

Things wouldn't be the way the are now
I'd make you see I loved you somehow
If I could only see you one more time

So please say you'll let me see you
Five minutes all alone
It's so hard to make you understand
Talking on the phone

I'd like you to know, I know, I was wrong
I'd like you to know my love is still strong
Jee, but I'd like to see you one more time

La, la, la
La, la, la
I'm so lonely tonight
