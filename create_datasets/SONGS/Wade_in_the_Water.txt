Wade in the water
Wade in the water children 
Wade in the water
Don't you know that God's gonna trouble the water
Don't you know that God's gonna trouble the water

I stepped in the water and the water was cold
Don't you know that God's gonna trouble the water
Said it chilled my body but not my soul
Don't you know that God's gonna trouble the water

Wade in the water

Wade in the water
Don't you know that God's gonna trouble the water
Don't you know that God's gonna trouble the water

Well I went to the water one day to pray
Don't you know that God's gonna trouble the water
And my soul got happy and I stayed all day
Don't you know that God's gonna trouble the water

Don't you know that God's gonna trouble the water
Don't you know that God's gonna trouble the water
