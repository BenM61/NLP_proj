Don't you know going crazy
Almost certain it's just your age
Don't you know going crazy
Wash the goodness down the drain
Just like a singer
A singer in your favourite band
Feel like a winner
But I don't know about that

Not worried bout money that you blow uh
Gossip doing rounds the more slutting that you do
'Cause I see you all the time in the line and you never pay
But nothings really free babe get it straight
In this place its the same thing everyday
Maybe nobody told you theres a better way
Doing everything you can to escape but you'll stay

And you always know the DJ
But that don't make it right
Girl I swear you always know the DJ
And you're there all the time
Thinking you're fine, you always know the DJ
(But somethings gonna come around)
(But somethings gonna come around)

Don't you know going crazy
Don't you think its all a scam
Don't you know going crazy
All the powers on your hands
Just like a singer
A singer all skin and bone
Feel like a winner
I'm telling you I don't know

Like
The dresses you wear
The people you please
Remember that they're
'Cause it's all well and good in the dark room
Baby when it hits you on your phone saying come boo
Baby they're looking up to everybody but you
Baby you're the exercise
Who you gonna run to?
Baby I know
That you wanna escape
But you'll stay (you'll stay)

And you always know the DJ
But that don't make it right
Girl I swear you always know the DJ
And you're there all the time
Thinking you're fine, you always know the DJ
(But somethings gonna come around)
(But somethings gonna come around)

Don't you know going crazy
Almost certain it's just your age
Don't you know going crazy
Wash the goodness down the drain
Now you're skinny
But you aren't hearing that
There's no convincing
You twisted up the facts

Give me a sign
I said give me a sign

And you always know the DJ
But that don't make it right
Girl I swear you always know the DJ
And you're there all the time
Thinking you're fine, you always know the DJ
