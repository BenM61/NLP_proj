Storm is brewing in the air tonight
So many pressures on my mind
Want to escape just wanna run away
But it's not an option I have to stay

And so I pray 
I wish that all these things would go away
To disappear if only for a day
Know I can't go but I don't wanna stay

Can't believe the irony 
The thing I wanted is killing me
All the happy smiles I miss
Didn't think it would be like this

And I pray 
I wish that all these things would go away
To disappear if only for a day
Know I can't go but I don't wanna stay

Storm is brewing in the air tonight

But it's not an option I have to stay

And so I pray 
I wish that all these things would go away
To disappear if only for a day
Know I can't go but I don't wanna stay
To be left alone if only for a day 
I wish that all these things would go away 
(Pray to you I hope it will be alright)
To be someone else if only for a day 
(And over soon, I feel it)
Know I can't go but I don't wanna stay 
(Hope that you hear me)
