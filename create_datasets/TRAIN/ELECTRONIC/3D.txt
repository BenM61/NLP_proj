Sugar coated white lies
Can only get you so far 
Before you get caught up in the middle
I'm a human too 
My life has value
And everybody will think the same

Good morning
It's time to wake up
Sugar coated and white lies in the middle
If this is a lie 
Then what am I?

Now I'm standing on my rooftop
And I
Sure could use someone to talk to
Someone to make it alright
'Cause I'm done pretending.

Sugar coated white lies
Can only get you so far 
Before you get caught up in the middle
I'm a human too 
My life has value
And everybody will think the same

I never thought that I would live to see
Everyone and me 
Struggling to breathe
If this is a lie 
Then what am I?

When the power of love
Exceeds the love for power
The world will finally 
Finally know peace

They fight for the center of universe with the sun 
Your trapped in your tube 
And blind from the truth 
This is the future that's in store for you.

Sugar coated white lies
Can only get you so far 
Before you get caught up in the middle
I'm a human too 
My life has value
And everybody will think the same

Sugar coated white lies
Can only get you so far 
Before you get caught up in the middle
I'm a human too 
My life has value
And everybody will think the same

This is the portrait 
The man behind the curtain has painted for you
As long as you choose to be separate
You leave yourselves completely enslaved
