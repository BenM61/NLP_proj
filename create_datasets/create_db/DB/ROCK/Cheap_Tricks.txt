She's fingering the petals on her dress
It was another lesson in the rise and fall of holiness
Her hands are shaking and her hair is a mess
Oh, yeah he pulled a cheap trick

The car has come and its taken her away
And she won't tell a soul cos she knows what they would say
Cos it gets a little tricky between blame and ricochet
Boy, it was a cheap trick
Boy, it was a cheap trick

Oh, lower than lonely
Slower, girl, slowly
You can just break them down
Oh, lower than lonely
Slower, girl, slowly
You can just turn them round
And all their cheap tricks

She smiles as she fumbles for the keys
And she won't look back up into that window when she leaves
If it's a choice between a martyr or a refugee
Oh, yeah she knows some sweet tricks
Yeah she knows some sweet tricks

Oh, lower than lonely
Slower, girl, slowly
You can just break them down
Oh, lower than lonely
Slower, girl, slowly
You can just turn them round
And all their cheap tricks

The night falls like a satin petticoat
And the bare bulb glows onto the letter that she wrote
Cos it takes a lot of oxygen to help you stay afloat
That or one more cheap trick
That or one more cheap trick

Oh, lower than lonely
Slower, girl, slowly
You can just break them down
Oh, lower than lonely
Slower, girl, slowly
You can just turn them round
Turn them round
And all their cheap tricks
And all their cheap tricks
And all their cheap tricks
And all their cheap tricks
