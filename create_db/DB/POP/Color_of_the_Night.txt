You and I moving in the dark
Bodies close but souls apart
Shadowed smiles and secrets unrevealed
I need to know the way you feel

[Chorus]
I'll give you everything I am
And everything I want to be
I'll put it in your hands
If you could open up to me oh
Can't we ever get beyond this wall

'Cause all I want is just once
To see you in the light
But you hide behind
The color of the night

I can't go on running from the past
Lave has torn away this mask
And now like clouds like rain I'm drowning and
I blame it all on you
I'm lost - God save me

'Cause all I want is just once
To see you in the light
But you hide behind
The color of the night

'Cause all I want is just once
Forever and again
I'm waiting for you, I'm standing in the light
But you hide behind
The color of the night

Please come out from
The color of the night
