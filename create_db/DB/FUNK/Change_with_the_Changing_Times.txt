I've been everywhere, I've seen everything
Know all the tricks that I ought to know
So why is it that I try to turn your tide
When I'm just drowning in your undertow
You're in need of greater sensation
I'm in need of better observation

Change with the changing times
I gotta change with the changing times
Change with the changing times
I gotta change with the changing times

You say you're growin' and I think it's showin' and
I only want the chance to see you through
So if I start to cling, I'll let you go sure thing
It's just my way of sayin' that I love you
You're in need of greater sensation
I'm standing here in Grand Central Station

Change with the changing times
I gotta change with the changing times
Change with the changing times
I gotta change with the changing times

I been to Tennessee, I've gone to Hollywood
I've been in Paris in my quest for you
No matter what I say, no matter what I do
Only you know what's best for you

Change with the changing times
I gotta change with the changing times
Change with the changing times
I gotta change with the changing times

Oh, change, change, change
Change with the
Change with the
Change with the changing times
