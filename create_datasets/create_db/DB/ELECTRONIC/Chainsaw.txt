Everyone loves you
But they don't love you like I do
And everyone knows you
But they ain't seen this side of you

I'm over the measure
One shot turns into four
And I end up injured
As love turns into war

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-oh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-oh

When I get over you
And get that dirt off my shoulder
Will I look like a fool
Or just a whole lot older

Giving myself to you
Was like giving myself to a chainsaw
You keep cutting me open wide
Is it the only thing that you're good for

Giving myself to you
Was like giving myself to a chainsaw
You keep cutting me open wide
Is it the only thing that you're good for

I can't remember
How we started this thing
But I know I was better
Before you pulled the strings

Something to mention
Before you kill me slow
I won't be the last one
The last one, that's for sure

Ooh, ooh (la la la la)
Ooh, ooh-oh (la la la la)
The last one, no (la la la la)
No, no-oh (la la la la)

When I get over you
And get that dirt off my shoulder
Will I look like a fool
Or just a whole lot older

Giving myself to you
Was like giving myself to a chainsaw
You keep cutting me open wide
Is it the only thing that you're good for

Giving myself to you
Was like giving myself to a chainsaw
You keep cutting me open wide
Is it the only thing that you're good for

What you gonna do when you've had enough
What you gonna say when it's all too late
What you gonna do when you fall in love
How you gonna feel when he does the same

What you gonna do when you've had enough
What you gonna say when it's all too late
You're staring at the piece that you broke apart
And you know you can't get it back again

Giving myself to you
Was like giving myself to a chainsaw
You keep cutting me open wide
Is it the only thing that you're good for

Giving myself to you
Was like giving myself to a chainsaw
You keep cutting me open wide
Is it the only thing that you're good for

[Repeat: x8]
Giving myself to you
Was like giving myself to a chainsaw

Giving myself to you
Ooh
