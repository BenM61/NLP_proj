He's got sugar on his lips
And he knows it is his
And he shows it
He just shows it
Do you remember, do you vow the chemical
Show you the picture without the same degree
All he wants is
Blow by blow by blow counts
All searching for the new thing
Scratching the surface, getting nowhere
My place is still invaded by sharks
Covered in glitter, shiny as glass
Leave him with something sweet
Galaxy sweet
He won't say no, he won't say yes
He won't say no, he won't say yeah
Crushing university
I am the queen
I've come to take the sweetness
Keeping down the make keep
Leave him with something sweet
He can't see soon
He won't say no, he won't say yes
He won't say no, he won't say yes
(BV: He won't say no) Everybody knows
(BV: He won't say yes) I've seen it with my eyes
(BV: He won't say no) Everybody knows
(BV: He won't say yeah) I've seen it with my eyes
