Yeah
It's officially the biggest midget in the game
I dunno
Make way for the S.O.V

[Chorus]
Love me or hate me, it's still an obsession
Love me or hate me, that is the question
If you love me, then thank you
If you hate me, then f*ck you
If you hate me, then f*ck you

I'm fat and need a diet
Na, in fact I'm just here lying and
I ain't got the biggest breast-s-s
But I write all the best hits
I got hairy armpits
But I don't walk around like this
I wear a big baggy t-shirt
That hides that nasty shit
Ugh, never had my nails done
Bite them down until they're none
I'm the one with a non-existent bum
I don't really give a ugh!
I'm missing my shepherd's pie
Like a high maintenance chick missing her diamonds
I'm missing my Clipper lighters
Now bow down to your royal highness
No, I don't own a Corgi
I had a hampster
It died 'cause I ignored thee
Go on then
Go on, report me
I'm English
Try and deport me

[Chorus]

I'm a funky little monkey
With the tiniest ears
I don't like drinking fancy champi
I stick with Heineken beers
Oops, might burp in your face
A little unladylike, what can I say?
Well, oh gosh, I'm not posh - me
I wear odd socks
I do what I'm doing, yeah
So everybody's entitled to opinions
I open my mouth, and, shit, I got billions
I'm the middle kid, the riddle kid
I make you giggle till you're sick
My nose jiggles while I spit

Yeah, I do have some stories
And it's true, I want all the glory
Go on then
Come on, support me
I'm English 
Try and deport me

[Chorus]

Love me or hate me
Love me or hate me

So I can't dance, and I really can't sing, yeah
I can only do one thing, and that's be Lady Sovereign
I can only do one thing, and that's be Lady Sovereign
