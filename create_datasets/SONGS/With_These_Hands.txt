Feel the fire burning from the other side
Flames scream hear the children cry
You see the wicked prowl across the border
They say death's the only peace the poor understand

Run for cover, run for cover the storm is breaking
Father, son, Mother, daughter
Their earth is shaking
Run to the river, The water is cool
Run to the river the water will heal your wounds

Say what you will
With these hands
Say what you will
I'll say it with these hands

There's danger on the highway, It's in the shadows
Darker, Darker, Darker, I see the light
It's moving faster, howling like the wind blows
Time comes when you longer fear the night
