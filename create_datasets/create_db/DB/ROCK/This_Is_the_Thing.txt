I don't know if you notice anything different
It's getting dark and it's getting cold and the nights are getting long
And I don't know if you even notice at all
That I'm long gone babe I'm long gone

And the things that keep us apart
Keep me alive
And the things that keep me alive
Keep me alone

This is the thing
This is the thing
This is the thing

I don't know if you notice anything missing
Like the leaves on the trees or my clothes all over the floor
And I don't know if you even notice at all
'Cause I was real quiet when I closed the door

And the things that keep us apart
Keep me alive
And the things that keep me alive
Keep me alone

This is the thing
This is the thing
This is the thing

And I don't know if you notice anything, different
I don't know if you even notice at all
And I don't know if you notice anything missing

This is the thing
This is the thing
This is the thing
This is the thing
This is the thing
