Tell me the story now
Now that it's over
Wrap it in glory
For one Irish Rover 

Tell me you wiser now
Tell me you older
Wrap it in glory
For one Irish Rover 

I can tell by the light in your eye
That you're so far away
Like a ship out on the sea
Without a sail, you've gone astray 

Tell me the facts real straight
Don't make me over
Wrap it in glory
For one Irish Rover
Tell me you see the light
Tell me you know me
Make it come out alright
And wrap it in glory
For one Irish Rover
For one Irish Rover
For one Irish Rover
For, one Irish Rover
For, one Irish Rover
