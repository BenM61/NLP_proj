I got the call today I didn't wanna hear
But I knew that it would come
An old, true friend of ours was talkin' on the phone
She said you'd found someone
And I thought of all the bad luck and all the struggles we went through
How I lost me, and you lost you
What are all these voices outside love's open door
Make us throw off our contentment and beg for something more?

I've been learning to live without you now
But I miss you sometimes
The more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought I knew, I'm learning them again
I've been tryin' to get down to the heart of the matter
But my will gets weak, and my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think it's about forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore

These times are so uncertain
There's a yearning undefined and people filled with rage
We all need a little tenderness
How can love survive in such a graceless age?
And the trust and self-assurance that lead to happiness 
Are the very things we kill, I guess
Pride and competition cannot fill these empty arms 
And the world they put between us - you know it doesn't keep us warm

I've been trying to live without you now
But I miss you, baby
The more I know, the less I understand
And all the things I thought I'd figured out, I have to learn again
I'm tryin' to get down to the heart of the matter
But my will gets weak, and my heart is so shattered
But I think it's about forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore

Oh, there are people in your life who've come and gone
They let you down; you know they hurt your pride
You got to put it all behind you 'cause life goes on
You keep carryin' that anger, it'll eat you up inside

I will live happily ever after and my heart is so shattered
But I know it's about forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me
I've been tryin' to get down to the heart of the matter
Because the flesh gets weak and the ashes will scatter
So I'm thinkin' about forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if you don't love me anymore
Even if you don't love me anymore
