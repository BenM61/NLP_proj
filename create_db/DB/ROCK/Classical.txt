There is no culture is my brag,
Your taste for bullshit reveals a lust for a home of office
This is the home of the vain!
This is the home of the vain!

Where are the obligatory niggers?
Hey there fuckface!
Hey there fuckface!
There are twelve people in the world

The rest are paste
This is the home of the vain!
This is the home of the vain!
I just left the hotel amnesia, I had to go there

Where it is I can't remember,
But now I can remember, now I can remember
Hafta! hafta!
Message for yer! message for yer!

Too much reliance on girl here
On girls here, behind every shell-actor
Snobbier snobbier
Too much romantic here

I destroy romantics, actors,
Kill it!
Kill it!
Kill it a!

Kill it!
Kill it a!
You won't find anything more ridiculous, than this new profile
Razor unit, made with the highest british attention to the

The classical!
The classical!

Hotel aggro!

One of the millennium of conspiracy,
Forever,
I know it means a lot of stomach gas,
I know it means a lot of stomach gas,

I've never felt better in my life
I've never felt better in my life
Poleaxe a!
The classical!

Stomach gas
I've never felt better in my life
I've never felt better in my life
Poleaxe a!

Millennium of conspiracy
Play out classical
I've never felt better in my life
Better in my life
