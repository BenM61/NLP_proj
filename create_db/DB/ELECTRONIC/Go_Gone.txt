I feel like, somethin' different,
(ha) Yo! Huh!
Feelin' good up here..
Hope you are too...
Besides...
But there's always someone
Who's gotta say somethin' stupid,

Da da da, gone, gone,

I see you watching me,
(I see you watchin')
And I know your looking deep in my face
(all in my face)
I just can't wait, can't wait to be found
But I aint going out no way
You see me rising higher
(higher)
And you try to put some news in my way
But I'm bigger and stronger,
Guess I'll go faster,
And you'll never gonna get in my way-ay-ay

[Chorus]
So..
Go, go, go, Gone,
Uh-uh,
Ahhh uh-uh ahhh uh-uh
So..
Go, go, go, Gone,
Uh-uh, ahhh uh-uh

Nothin' u say means nothin' to me,
(Nothin' to me)
And I'm still gonna be where I wanna be,
If I dye my hair orange (orange)
Never say I'm sorry (Sorry)
And I'm never gonna change for you-ou-ou-ou
All I know is I do my best
(I do my best)
And the best as far as I can see
See God gave me honours, and he made me who I am,
And the best is good enough for me-ee-ee-ee-ee

[Chorus]
So..
Go, go, go, Gone,
Uh-uh,
Ahhh uh-uh ahhh uh-uh
So..
Go, go, go, Gone,
Uh-uh, ahhh uh-uh

(Nothin' to say)
Nothin' to say
(keep it shut)
Keep ya mouth shut
(You shouldn't hate)
Shouldn't hate stuff puttin' out that negative energy
Bring back the love

(Nothin' to say)
You have nothin' nothin' good to say,
(keep it shut)
Keep it shut
(You shouldn't hate)
You shouldn't hate .....

Bring back the love, I said bring back the,
Bring back the love

[Chorus]
So..
Go, go, go, Gone,
Uh-uh,
Ahhh uh-uh ahhh uh-uh
So..
Go, go, go, Gone,
Uh-uh, ahhh uh-uh

Uh! Well! Yo!
Feelin' good out there,
(ahhh uh-uh ahhh uh-uh)
Whoo!
(ahhh uh-uh ahhh uh-uh)

[Chorus]
So..
Go, go, go, Gone,
Uh-uh,
Ahhh uh-uh ahhh uh-uh
So..
Go, go, go, Gone,
Uh-uh, ahhh uh-uh
So..
Go, go, go, Gone,
Uh-uh,
Ahhh uh-uh ahhh uh-uh
So..
Go, go, go, Gone,
Uh-uh,
Ahhh uh-uh ahhh uh-uh

Bring back the love....
Ooohh...
