Is this for real 
This can't be real
Are you for real
I must be dreaming
Is this for real
This can't be real
Woah

Ya so bad to di bone
Can't leave you alone
It's like yo inside my dreams
A perfect fantasy
A perfect fantast

'Cause every kiss, every touch
Boy you got me blushing
You blew mind roll in lika a russian
I'm on a double baby inna rush
Boy you put your spell on me
'Cause every minute, every day
Boy you got me senseless
I put my guard down playin' my defenses
I'm inna loop boy lost in you love
Boy you know me need it so much

Ya so bad to di bone
Can't leave you alone
It's like yo inside my dreams
A perfect fantasy
A perfect fantast

A now fling it up, back it up
I make it tear it up
De way you put it on me
I gotta give it up
You know what I'm in luck
I wanna love you up
I wanna let you know 
I never let you go
Daddy you have the ticket and you get the price
Bad to di bone ah you know me no like
Adamana check it but a dem get it klein
That's why me love you long time

Ya so bad to di bone
Can't leave you alone
It's like yo inside my dreams
A perfect fantasy
A perfect fantast

'Cause every kiss, every touch
Boy you got me blushing
You blew mind roll in lika a russian
I'm on a double baby inna rush
Boy you put your spell on me
'Cause every minute, every day
Boy you got me senseless
I put my guard down playin' my defenses
I'm inna loop boy lost in you love
Boy you know me need it so much

Ya so bad to di bone
Can't leave you alone
It's like yo inside my dreams
A perfect fantasy
A perfect fantast

A now fling it up, back it up
