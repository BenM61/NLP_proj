I sit alone in my four-cornered room staring at candles
Oh that shit is on? Heh
Let me drop some shit like this here, real smooth

At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Candle sticks in the dark, visions of bodies bein' burned
Four walls just starin' at a nigga
I'm paranoid, sleepin' with my finger on the trigger
My mother's always stressin' I ain't livin' right
But I ain't going out without a fight
See, everytime my eyes close
I start sweatin', and blood starts comin' out my nose
It's somebody watchin' the Ak' 
But I don't know who it is, so I'm watchin' my back
I can see him when I'm deep in the covers
When I awake I don't see the motherfucker
He owns a black hat like I own
A black suit and a cane like my own
Some might say, Take a chill, be
But f*ck that shit!  There's a nigga trying to kill me
I'm poppin' in the clip when the wind blows
Every twenty seconds got me peepin out my window
Investigatin' the joint for traps
Checkin' my telephone for taps
I'm starin' at the woman on the corner
It's fucked up when your mind is playin' tricks on ya

I make big money, I drive big cars
Everybody know me, it's like I'm a movie star
But late at night, somethin' ain't right
I feel I'm being tailed by the same sucker's head lights
Is it that fool that I ran off the block?
Or is it that nigga last week that I shot?
Or is it the one I beat for five thousand dollars
Thought he had 'caine but it was Gold Medal Flour
Reach under my seat, grabbed my popper for the suckers
Ain't no use to me lyin', I was scareder than a motherfucker
Hooked a left into Popeye's and bailed out quick
If it's goin' down let's get this shit over with
Here they come, just like I figured
I got my hand on the motherfuckin' trigger
What I saw'll make your ass start gigglin'
Three black, crippled and crazy senior citizens
I live by the sword
I take my boys everywhere I go, because I'm paranoid
I keep lookin' over my shoulder and peepin' around corners 
My mind is playin' tricks on me

Day by day it's more impossible to cope
I feel like I'm the one that's doing dope
Can't keep a steady hand because I'm nervous
Every Sunday mornin' I'm in service
Prayin' for forgiveness
And tryin' to find an exit out the business
I know the Lord is lookin' at me
But yet and still it's hard for me to feel happy
I often drift while I drive
Havin' fatal thoughts of suicide
Bang and get it over with
And then I'm worry-free, but that's bullshit
I got a little boy to look after
And if I died then my child would be a bastard
I had a woman down with me
But to me it seemed like she was down to get me
She helped me out in this shit
But to me she was just another bitch
Now she's back with her mother
Now I'm realizing that I love her
Now I'm feelin' lonely
My mind is playin' tricks on me

This year Halloween fell on a weekend
Me and Geto Boys are trick-or-treatin'
Robbin little kids for bags
Till an old man got behind our ass
So we speeded up the pace
Took a look back, and he was right before our face
He'd be in for a squabble no doubt
So I swung and hit the nigga in his mouth
He was goin' down, we figured
But this was no ordinary nigga
He stood about six or seven feet
Now, that's the nigga I'd be seein in my sleep
So we triple-teamed on him
Droppin' them motherfuckin' be	's on him
The more I swung the more blood flew
Then he disappeared and my boys disappeared, too
Then I felt just like a fiend
It wasn't even close to Halloween
It was dark as f*ck on the streets
My hands were all bloody, from punchin' on the concrete
God damn, homie
My mind is playin' tricks on me
