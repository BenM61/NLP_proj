What am I to do, when you act a fool
Do I put on your shoes and act a fool like you
No baby, that ain't cool, you ain't got a clue
What you had in me, too fine to see
And I don't really wanna be, baby

What's the reason you want me
Girl the truth is you need me
First you say that you trust me
Then you go and betray me

Now I took all I can
And I know I'm a good man
God I wash my hands, make another plan
'Cause I don't really wanna stay baby

So if you wanna go, walk right out that door
'Cause I don't want no more of your pretty girl bull-ish
If you wanna leave, it's okay with me
Matter of fact I'm begging please
Take your pretty girl bull

Now this is number two, them chance I gave to you
You said it was the end, but here we go again
I thought I was a friend, not just another man
While holding hands, you don't understand
And I don't really get you baby

What's the reason you want me
Girl the truth is you need me
First you say that you trust me
Then you go and betray me

Now I took all I can
And I know I'm a good man
God I wash my hands, make another plan
'Cause I don't really wanna stay baby

So if you wanna go, walk right out that door
'Cause I don't want no more of your pretty girl bull-ish
If you wanna leave, it's okay with me
Matter of fact I'm begging please
Take your pretty girl bull
