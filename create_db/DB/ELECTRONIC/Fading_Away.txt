Oh, I want you near me
Your touch is silver and your eyes are blue
Oh, I need you with me
For you are faithful and always true
Oh, I love your sweet possession
Don't ever leave me please don't go away
Tell me all your deep confessions
I'm yours forever and I'm here to stay

Oh, how I miss you
Oh, I feel my love is fading away
Fading away
Fading away
Fading away

Oh, please come back to me
Your eyes are shining and your heart is gold
Oh, why can't you hear me?
Our love was burning now it's growing cold
Don't you ever try to wake up
Just listen to me give me one more chance
Now I think it's time we make up
The winds of heaven let our spirits dance

Oh, how I miss you
Oh, I feel my love is fading away
Fading away
Fading away
Fading away

If I believed you, I'd crawl back to you
The words you're saying now it's nothing new
I'd crawl on my knees and just beg for more
But this is the last time I'm at the door

Oh, how I miss you
Oh, I feel our love is fading away
Fading away
Fading away
Fading away

Fading away
