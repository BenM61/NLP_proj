There are times I find it hard to sleep at night
We are living through such troubled times
And every child that reaches out
For someone to hold
For one moment
They become my own

And how can I pretend that I don't know
What's going on?
When every second
And every minute
Another soul is gone

And I believe that in my life
I will see
An end to hopelessness
Or giving up
Or suffering

Then we all stand together this one time
Then no one will get left behind
And stand up for life
Stand up
And here me sing
Stand up
For love

I'm inspired
And hope
For each and everyday
That's how I know that things are going to change
So how can I pretend that I don't know
What's going on?
When every second
And every minute
Another soul is gone

And I believe that in my life
I will see
An end to hopelessness
Or giving up
Or suffering

If we all stand together this one time
Then no one will get left behind
And stand up for life
Stand up
For love

And it all starts right here
And it starts right now
One person stand up man!
And the rest will follow
From the forgotten
And From the Unloved

I'm gonna sing this song,

And I believe
That in my life
I will see
An end to hopelessness
Or giving up
Or suffering

If we all stand together this one time
Then no one will get left behind
And stand up
For life
Stand up
And sing
Stand up
For love
