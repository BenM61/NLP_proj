Here she come, her beauty irresistible
I know she bad news now you need to know
You'll never be nothing else but a stepping stone, ah, ah
I know you want her but if I was you
I wouldn't 'cause I know what she can do
She'll eat your heart raw, no barbecue, ah, ah

She's a beast, it's too late, she calling, calling
She's a beast, and you're the bait, she calling 
Don't fall in love with a monster 'cause she'll chew you up
She'll chew you up, she'll chew you up
She's a beast, she calling, she calling
She's a beast
She's a beast
She's a beast

That girl so hot it can't be legal
She playing you, prey on you like an eagle
She evil, ff-ing 'round with your ego, oh, oh

Now you thinking you're the only one
But you gonna wish you never met her
Daddy told you don't go out with a loaded gun
Bang, bang

She's a beast, it's too late, she calling, calling
She's a beast, and you're the bait, she calling 
Don't fall in love with a monster 'cause she'll chew you up
She'll chew you up, she'll chew you up
She's a beast, she calling, she calling
She's a beast
She's a beast
She's a beast

She's a beast, it's too late
She's a beast, and you're the bait
She's a beast, oh
She's a beast, it's too late (She's a beast, oh)
She's a beast, she's a beast
She's a beast

She's a beast
She's a beast
She's a beast
