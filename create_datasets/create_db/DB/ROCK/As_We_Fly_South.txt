Hurt people, harm people just because they love the rush
Hearts float in pairs but if one falls well that's when they crash
Listen clear I can bet you that you won't hear a thing
Inside all these people are small kids all ready to scream

As we fly south
We all go down
If one falls out
Then we all slow down, falling now
Yeah we all go down

Move on and pretend that this never happened to us
Here's how it happened, something well it's bigger than us

As we fly south
We all go down
If one falls out
Then we all slow down, falling now
Yeah we all slow down, falling now

When you're lonely and you're looking at the walls now
And you think you're gonna tear them all down
When you're lonely and you're looking at the walls now
And you think you're gonna tear them all down
When you're lonely and you're looking at the walls now
And you think you're gonna tear them all down
When you're lonely and you're looking at the walls now
And you think you're gonna tear them all

As we fly south
We all go down
If one falls out
Then we all slow down, falling now

As we fly south
We all go down
If one falls out
Then we all slow down, falling now

As we fly south
Then we all slow down, falling now
If one falls out
Then we all slow down, falling now
Yeah we all slow down
