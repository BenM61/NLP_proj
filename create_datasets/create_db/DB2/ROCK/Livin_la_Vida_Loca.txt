She's in to Superstition, black cats & voodoo dolls
I feel a premonition, that girl's gonna make make me fall
She's in to new sensations, new kicks in candle light
She's got a new addiction, for everyday and night

She'll make you take your clothes off and go
Dancin'in the rain
She'll make you live her crazy life,
She'll take away your pain
A bullet through your brain.

Upside inside out, Livin la vida loca
She'll push and pull down, Livin la vida loca
Her lips are are devil red, Skins the colour o'mocca
She will wear you out Livin la vida loca
Livin la vida loca, livin la vida ...loca.

Wake up in New York City, inn a funky cheap motel
Took my heart, took my money
She must o'slipped me a sleeping pill

She never drinks the water, makes you order french
Champagne
Once you've had a taste of her, you 'll never be the
Same
She'll make you go insane

Upside inside out, Livin la vida loca
She'll push and pull down, Livin la vida loca
Her lips are are devil red, Skins the colour o'mocca
She will wear you out Livin la vida loca
Livin la vida loca, livin la vida ...loca.

She'll make you take your clothes off...
