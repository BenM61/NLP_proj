You'll never get that taste, out of your mouth
You'll never the paw prints, out of the hen house now
And you can't go back, same way you came
Round all the pieces up, but they just don't fit the same

White knuckles
Maybe it's not so bad
So let your hair down now

White knuckles
Yeah maybe its not so bad
Aww go ahead and let it down

So come and let it all out, let it bleed
Did you get what you want? did you get what you need?
Behind the lines, behind the walls
Tell me whats the bet you made, was it that bad after all?

White knuckles
Yeah maybe its not so bad
So let your hair down now

White knuckles
Aww maybe its not so bad
Just let it all come down now

So just have fun, its far enough
Everybody needs to sleep at night, everybody needs a crutch
But couldn't good, be good enough?
'Cause nothin' ever doesn't change but nothin' changes much

Yeah, maybe its not so bad
So let your hair down now
White knuckles

Aww maybe its not so bad
Just let it all come down now

Yeah maybe its not so bad
Just let your hair come down now

Oh maybe its not so bad
Just let it all come down
