Sam
You've been waiting much to long
Now it looks like she's not coming home.
Sam

You've been loyal
True and faithful
All this time with being alone.
If I could get that same dedication
I'd give you everything in creation
If she doesn't come back

If she doesn't come back
I'll be your substitute
Whenever you want me
Don't you know I'll be your substitute
Whenever you need me

Sam every day you waited for her
I've been waiting here for you.
Sam
All this time I've been lonely

I know what you've been going through
I'll wait until ain't chances will come
'Cause you can't keep playing on her
If she doesn't come back.

If she doesn't come back
I'll be your substitute
Whenever you want me
Don't you know I'll be your substitute
Whenever you need me

Each day by your window you sit and sigh hoping to see her face.
Ay
You might as well forget about her and find someone to take
Her place.

If she doesn't come back
I'll be your substitute
Whenever you want me
Don't you know I'll be your substitute
Whenever you need me

Don't you know I'll be your substitute...
