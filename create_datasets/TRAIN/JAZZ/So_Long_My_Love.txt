So long, my love, goodbye, farewell, adieu,
So long, my love, our love's no longer true,
Let's make the final scene nice and clean, no aftermath,
Oh miss the bitter talk, and just walk us a separate path, face it,

Be sure this kiss is now an endless thing,
I seem to miss the bells that use to ring,
So like they say in France, when romance is all fini
Please give me my chapeau, cause I gotta get going.
I'll say so long , my love, before you say it to me.

Let's face it, be sure this kiss is now an endless thing.
I seem to miss the bells that use to ring.
So like they say in France when romance is all fini,
Please give me my chapeau, I gotta get rolling.

So I'll say so long, my love, buzz off, my love,
Take a walk, my love, before you say it, before you lay it on me.
