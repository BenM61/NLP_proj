My gold marigolds attack
My black bed of roses
I'm going to bring 'em all back
With hypnosis ho

And I know that I won't be
The easiest to set free
And I know that I won't be the last
Cold captain tied to the mast

I recall you on the telephone
I recall when you get mad
I will still love you to death
And I won't ever forget how

And I know that it won't be
The easiest to set free
And I know that I won't be the last
Cold captain tied to the mast

I'm on the other side
I'm satisfied
I'm a spirit dove
I'm looking for your love

I'm simple as a matter of fact
A punch in the nose don't overreact
I will still love you to death
And I won't ever forget how

And I know that I won't be
The easiest to set free
And I know that I won't be the last
Cold captain tied to the mast

And I know that I won't be the one
To securely know when it's wrong
But I hope I know when it's past
And I hope I know when to show you my
Whole love
Whole love
Whole love
Whole love
Whole love
Whole love
Whole love
I won't ever forget how
