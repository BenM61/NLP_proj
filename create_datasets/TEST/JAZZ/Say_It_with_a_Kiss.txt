Let me hear you say it
Say it with a kiss
It you mean that look I've seen
Say it with a kiss
There is wine and candle shine
And music in your lips
Music in the tops
Of your fingertips

Words may not convey it
Say it with a kiss
And your look might speak a book
That my eyes might miss
You don't have to know the words
To love's familiar tune
Say it with a kiss
And say it soon
