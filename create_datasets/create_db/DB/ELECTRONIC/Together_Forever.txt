It's been so long since we've been friends in need
And how the love we share in our hearts
To try to keep us apart
It took sometime to build this trust in me
But now you're all I have to
You want the best of my love
To keep away from the thoughts that we share
Is to feel the pain that I feel when you are not there
See what you want to see but please have some faith in me

Together forever yours
Together forever mine
Facing what we feel inside
Ready to stand the test of time

I've seen us come together in my dreams
And felt the kiss that makes me love you
Enough to see us through
It took sometime to feel the way I feel
That's why I know I'm here forever
And you will always be there
To keep away from the thoughts that we share
Is to feel the pain that I feel when you are not there
See what you want to see but please have some faith in me

Together forever yours
Together forever mine
Facing what we feel inside
Ready to stand the test of time
Together forever yours
Together forever mine
Facing what we feel inside
Ready to stand the test of time

(Come on) Together (I can't wait) Forever
(Come on) Together (yeah yeah) Forever
(Come on) Together (I can't wait) Forever
(Come on) Together (yeah yeah) Forever
(Come on) Together (I can't wait) Forever
(Come on) Together (yeah yeah) Forever
(Come on) Together (I can't wait for love...)

Together forever yours
Together forever mine
Facing what we feel inside
Ready to stand the test of time
Together forever yours
Together forever mine
Facing what we feel inside
Ready to stand the test of time
Together forever yours
Together forever mine
Facing what we feel inside
Ready to stand the test of time
Together forever yours
Together forever mine
Facing what we feel inside
Ready to stand the test of time
