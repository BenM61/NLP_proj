Gross and perverted
Obsessed and derranged
I have existed for years
But very little has changed
I'm a tool of the government
And industry too
For I desire to rule
And regulate you
Vile and pernicious
But you can't look away
I make you think I'm delicious
With the stuff that I say
I'm the best you can get
Have you guessed me yet?
I'm the slime oozing out from your TV set

Tell me you love me
Tell me you love me
Tell me you love me
Like I want you too
I love you so much
I'm crying for you
I wanna come inside and get ahold of you

You get me wasted and you're half-way there
If my mind is tore up, then my body don't care
I'm the air
I'm the water
I'm the dirt beneath your shoes
Tie me all up, strap down and get loose
F*ck yourself up
Your body and your soul
Sooner or later, you'll believe what I've told

Tell me you love me
Tell me you love me
Tell me you love me
I want you too
I love you so much
I'm crying for you
Burning with fire
You're my heart's desire

Tell me
Tell me
Tell me you love me
