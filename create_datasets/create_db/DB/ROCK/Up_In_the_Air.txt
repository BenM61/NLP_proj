I've been up in the air
Out of my head
Stuck in a moment of emotion I've destroyed
Is this the end I feel?
Up in the air
This is my life
All of the laws I've broken, loves that I've sacrificed
Is this the end?
I wrap my hands around you heart so tight with love, love

A thousand times I've tempted fate
A thousand times I've played this game
A thousand times that I have said today, today, today

I've been up in the air
Lost in the night
I wouldn't trade out for you lies you lost for my life
Is this the end
You were the love of my life, the darkness, the light
This is a portrait of the tortured you and I
Is this the, is this the, is this the end?
I wrap my hands around you heart so tight with love, love, love

A thousand times I've tempted fate
A thousand times I've played this game
A thousand times that I have said today, today, today
A thousand times I've tempted fate
A thousand times I've played this game
A thousand times that I have said today, today, today

I've been up in the air
Is this the end I feel?
Up in the air
Chasing a dream so real
I've been up in the air (I wrap my hands around you heart)
Is this the end I feel
Up in the air
Chasing a dream, chasing a dream

Take no more
Take no more
Take no more
I'll take no more

A thousand times I've tempted fate (I'll take no more)
A thousand times I've played this game (I'll take no more)
A thousand times that I have said today, today, today (I'll take no more)

Today (I wrap my hands)
Today (hands around)
Today (your heart)
Today (with love, love)
Today (I'll wrap my hands)
Today (around your heart)
Today (with love, love)
Today

I'll wrap my hands around your heart
I'll wrap my hands around your heart with love, love
