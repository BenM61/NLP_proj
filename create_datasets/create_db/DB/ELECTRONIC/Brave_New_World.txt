The Earth is shaking down below our feet.
We move in wonder how we generate the beat.
My blood is boiling, wonderful in heat.
We glow like embers dancing in the dark.

Where is the Promised Land? Where is the brave new world?
Why do all dreams grow and then die? How we can move the streets today?
Where is the Promised Land? Where is the brave new world?
Why do all dreams grow and then die? How we can move the streets today?

(Where is the Promised Land? Where is the brave new world?
Where is the Promised Land? Where is the brave new world?)

The lights are fading out before our eyes.
We lose each other as we celebrate the beat.
Our lives are changing faster then we think.
We flow like dancers crashing in the dark.Th
