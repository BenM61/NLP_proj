She wraps her tragic moments tightly around my neck
She hangs herself with them as I try to disconnect
She wants to choke on her life again
Breathing it in like a deadly poison.

She cries cause she's lost and she doesn't even know what she wants
And Her eyes grow cold and she begs the world to just let her go

(But I won't let her go)

She lives and breathes in a world that brought her to her knees
And now I'm addicted to her 'cause that girl is just like me
And I'm gonna choke on her life again
Breathing it in like a deadly poison.
I just wana get through to her,
Before her last breath.

She cries cause she's lost and she doesn't even know what she wants
And Her eyes grow cold and she begs the world to just let her go

She cries cause she's lost and she doesn't even know what she wants
And she hides all alone inside the pain that she won't let go
Watching her life pass her by, watching it all through her watering eyes
But I'll be chasing dragonflies from her darkest skies until the day she dies.
