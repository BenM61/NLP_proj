Beautiful isle of somewhere
Somewhere the sun is shining
Somewhere the songbirds dwell
Hush then, thy sad repining
God lives and all is well

Somewhere, somewhere
Beautiful isle of somewhere
Land of the true
Where we live anew
Beautiful isle of somewhere

Somewhere the load is lifted
Close by an open gate
Somewhere the clouds are rifted
Somewhere the angels wait

Somewhere, somewhere
Beautiful isle of somewhere
Land of the true
Where we live anew
Beautiful isle of somewhere
