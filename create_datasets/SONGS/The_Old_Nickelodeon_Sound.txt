I guess I'm an old-fashioned dreamer
Walking the street on my own
Out of date, like the old-fashioned steamer
No longer feeling at home
For now romance has gone, time races on
But I still remember
The town, the girls, the bar full of sailors
And the old nickelodeon sound

The old cobblestone street echoes of feet
Like distant reminders
Of the town, the girls, the bar full of sailors
And the old nickelodeon sound

There used to be all kinds of places where people like me used to go
Full of rough but friendly old faces
Looking for someone to know
But now, they only belong in old films or songs
Almost forgotten
Like the town, the girls, the bar full of sailors
And the old nickelodeon sound

The old cobblestone street echoes of feet
Like distant reminders
Of the town, the girls, the bar full of sailors
And the old nickelodeon sound
