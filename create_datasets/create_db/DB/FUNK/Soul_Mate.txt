Given the chance
I would love the hell out of you, little girl
Don't you know
Give me a sign (give me a sign)
Let me know if it's alright that I desire you

You've got just what it takes
To turn me on
You're out of sight girl, don't you know?

I just want to kiss you on your
Desire, baby
I've got a thing for you
I want to kiss ya!

I feel like trying (feel like trying) my love out on you, girl
Feel like trying (feel like trying, oh!)
Trying my love out on you, girl (feel like trying)
I feel like trying out (feel like trying)

Movin' around
Girl you got me so upset, don't you know
Don't it show
Give me a place (give me a place)
To say, baby let's get down
All the way

You've got just what it takes
To turn me on
And I'm out of sight girl, don't you know?

I just want to kiss you on your
Desire, baby
