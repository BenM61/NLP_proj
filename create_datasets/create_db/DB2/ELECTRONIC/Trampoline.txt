I've been havin' dreams
Jumpin' on a trampoline
Flippin' in the air
I never land, just float there
As I'm looking up
Suddenly the sky erupts
Flames alight the trees
Spread to fallin' leaves
Now they're right upon me

Wait if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved

I've been having dreams
Splashin' in a summer stream
Trip and I fall in
I wanted it to happen
My body turns to ice
Crushin' weight of paradise
Solid block of gold
Lying in the cold
I feel right at home

Wait if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved

Wait if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved

I never feel so loved

Wait if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved

Wait if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved
