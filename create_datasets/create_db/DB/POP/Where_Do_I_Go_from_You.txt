Empty sky where the stars used to be
They shine for everybody else, don't shine for me, no
Since you went away
Ever since you took your love away from me (rainbows fade)

They fade to black and white, baby
No, it's never gonna be the same
The same without you in my life, girl
'Cause you were the best thing I ever had
I'll never find another love like that
So tell me, tell me

Where do I go from you? (Where do I go baby?)
A lonely street is where every road (Where do I go?)
Is gonna lead me to (no, no, no oh)
Oh, what do I do with these blues, baby? 
I wanna know (I wanna know), where do I go from you?

I should've took the time
To show how much I care
Should've realized just what I had
When I had you there

I let you get away
Should've never let you get away from me (I miss your smile)
I wish I was with you, girl
I regret the day I threw away
The sweetest heaven ever found, baby

'Cause you were the best thing
I ever had, yes you were
Where do I find another love like that?
So tell me, tell me baby, yeah

Where do I go from you? (Where do I go, where do I go baby?)
A lonely street is where every road
Is gonna lead me to (gotta let go)
Oh, what do I do with these blues, baby?
I wanna know (I wanna know), where do I go from you?

'Cause I keep wonderin' what I'm gonna do
'Cause I could search every place
But I'll never find someone
To take the place of you
No, it's just no use, it's just no use
Where do I go, baby tell me please, baby

Where do I go from you?
A lonely street is where every road
Is gonna lead me to
Oh, what do I do with these blues, baby?
I wanna know (I wanna know), where do I go from you? (Where do I go, where do I go?)

Where do I go from you?
A lonely street is where every road
Is gonna lead me to (no)
Where do I go from you? (Where do I go?)
