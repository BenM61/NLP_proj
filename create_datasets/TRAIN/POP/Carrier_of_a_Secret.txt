Carrier of a secret
No one wants to know
Show a little conscience

Guardian of the palace
No one wants to go
Broken hearted monster

Tell me the words that'll touch me
Tell me what's hurting you so

Carrier of a secret
Let your secret go

Carrier of a secret
Whispered in the dark
What are you afraid of?

Carrier of a secret
Hidden in your heart
Show me what you are made of

Now put your hand to the quiver
Now to the bend of the bow

Let it fly, let it light the sky above you
Let it fly, let somebody try to love you

Carrier of a secret
To unhip to show
Too uncool to mention

Carrier of a secret
Let your secret go
More like confession

Now like a bird from your window
Now like a song from your heart

Let it fly, let it light the sky above you
Let it fly, let somebody try to love you

How many mountains must you climb?
How many tears must you cry?
How many seasons must go by
Before you let your secret fly?
How many mountains must you climb
Before you let your secret flow?

Let it fly, let it light the sky above you

(Fly)
How many mountains must you climb?
How many tears must you cry?
How many seasons must go by
Before you let your secret

(Fly)
How many mountains must you climb?
How many tears must you cry?
(Let somebody try to love you)
How many seasons must go by
Before you let your secret fly

How many mountains must you climb?
How many tears must you cry?
How many seasons must go by
Before you let your secret fly?

How many mountains must you climb?
How many tears must you cry?
How many seasons must go by
Before you let your secret fly?
