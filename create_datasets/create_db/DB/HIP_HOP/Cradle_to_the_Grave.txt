From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy, livin' in the ghetto
From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy

June 16th, 1971,
Mama gave birth to a hell-raisin heavenly son
See the doctor tried to smack me but I smacked him back
My first words was "Thug for life," and "Papa pass the Mac."
I'm bustin' on these motherfuckers ballin'
Listen you can hear my mini fourteen callin' 
From out the window of my drop top, I got my Glock cocked
Bustin' at niggas, when will it stop?
Now tell me are you scared of the dark?
Can't close my eyes I see visions
And even with this thug livin, will I escape prison?
Penitentiary chances was an all day thang
The only way to advance; and if you slang
Then you'd better have yo' Nike's on - cause when we fight
It's in the middle of the night with no lights on, hey!!
There must be a God cause I feel lucky
Paranoid out my mind, cause motherfuckers tryin' to rush me
Am I goin' to jail? Look at me bailin'
Comin' out the court house, all about my mail and bank
Never, never die I'll be a hustler motherfuckers
And makin' thugs out you suckers from the cradle to the grave

From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy, livin' in the ghetto

From the cradle to the grave since a little bitty child
I've been known to get ill and kinda buck wild
Pop pop! Just like the part that's in my walk with street talk
I'm runnin' up the block in the dark where lead spark
Surveillance on a nigga every day
Waitin' on my daddy just to take his ass away
Now Mama always workin' tryin' to make ends meet
So now a young nigga's bein' raised by the streets
And then the only other one that ever showed me love
Was my dope fiend uncle strung out on drugs
A straight - thug; just me, my mama out here on our own
So I got two gats - one black and one of chrome
Now I don't wanna hurt nobody but I must defend mine!
It's all the f*ck I got, so stop and walk a thin line
Young niggas be brave
And keep on thuggin' from the cradle to the grave
From the cradle to the grave

From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy, livin' in the ghetto

From the cradle to the grave
I'm glad to say, I made it this far
Many G's died hogs and all they got was they name hit up on a wall
It's sad thinkin' about the times
Life goes on, I'm steady lost in this land
That's the war zone, I gots no home, don't have no friends neither
It's just me by my lonely so I married my nina
I keeps her wherever I go, I love my ho
Never leave home with out my sugar, I'm hafta plug a nigga
Mama told me not to trust no punks
And kick his ass if he lay a hand on me since then I been knowin'
Sometimes I think my own self stupid
Cause I stay shootin at marks, get twisted up in police reports
Since the cradle, I've been ungrateful
My first toy was a gun I got sprung and learned to love weapons
But now I'm through with money, and through with street fame
Somebody peeled my cap, and put me in my grave

From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy, livin' in the ghetto
From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy, livin' in the ghetto

March 18th, a rainy day my mama gave birth
To a baby boy trapped in hell on Earth
From day one it wasn't fun I never had a crumb
Daddy worked two jobs and Mama won't stop drinkin' rum
I tried to cope loc, but my family's broke
And my pocket's short so now I got ta slang dope
In the game filled with pain it's a fuckin' shame
The white man got a motherfucker slangin 'caine
So now it's on from dusk to dawn I'm gettin my serve on
Always in the spot with my Glock slingin rocks at the Rox
The shit don't stop, I'm steady dodgin cops
I never flip-flop, hear my Glock cock, thug 'til I drop
And if I hit the pen I gotta do my time
Sittin' on my bunk reminiscin' bout the good times
It's fucked up a nigga gotta grow up doin' dirt
But from the cradle to the grave I'ma put in work

From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy, livin' in the ghetto
From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy, livin' in the ghetto

Time's movin' fast, will I last another day?
So I pray and I lay with my A-K
Did I sell my soul as a young kid?
All the things I did wishin' someone held me but they never did
I can't take it, will I make it to my older age?
Before I'm shot up or locked up in a fuckin' cage
Lord help me, guide me, save me!
Cause that's the way that Daddy raised me, crazy
Do or die, nigga pull the trigger don't give a f*ck
You'd rather be in jail than get yo' ass bucked
Nobody cares, it's me against the world
Keepin' murder on my mind and my tec-9
I got nothin' to lose, payin dues, nigga you wanna die?
I get high and then my mission is a walk-by
You'd better jet when I hit your set cause I'm comin'
Start runnin' yellin' "evil mind" as I'm gunnin'
One in the chamber for the anger that I build inside
For the mothers that cried, for my homies that died
The beginning is an ending, am I just a slave?
So I got to be brave from the cradle to the grave

From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy, livin' in the ghetto
From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy, livin' in the ghetto
