have horn will travel
me and my horn we live on the road
ain't no place too far to go
have horn will travel

and when I'll get ther baby everything will be alright
I've been from Paris to London to New Orleans
if you've been to the moon you aint got nothing on me
and when I'll get ther baby everything will be alright
and when I'll get ther baby everything will be alright
have horn will travel
so look out baby 'cause here I come

To 
rio de Jenero, to Istambul, I'me going Kansa City 
next stop is North Pole
have horn will travel
and when I get to you baby everything will be nice

I've been 10000 miles in 29 days
Now I'll got to get back where my baby stays
have horn will travel
and when I get to you baby , uuuh, it will sure be nice
have horn will travel
have horn will travel

we ain't gonna put no money
reached the fund and the money
I'll make that gig no matter what the cost
I won't get drunk and I won't get lost
