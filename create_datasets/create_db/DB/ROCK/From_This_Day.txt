Go 1, 2, 3, 4,  

Yeah yeah you gotta 
Stand tall and cut away the ties 
Drop Balls and hold that head up high 
The world is fast and youth ain't gonna wait 
So grab a hold before it gets to late 
Bare your soul and strip away the cold 
Of withered life that's past so gray and old 
'Cause all the pain that that's filled these eyes you see 

Has made them bleed just recently 
Tears that made me 
Ashamed to be me 
But that gave me 
Strength to see me 
Made a spark that 
Lit the dark 
Let me shine 

Time to see, believe this in me 
This pain that I feel deep inside 

'Cause its time when you come together, peel together 
Better now so do it now or never 
I fall sleep to freeways far from here 
Spend half the night just drinking beer 
From this day on shall be the words 
My flesh and bones shall make it heard 
Don't you test Ill have to mess with you 
Do my best so f*ck the rest of you 
One of these days 
You'll see I've always been right 

Time to see, believe this in me 
This pain that I feel deep inside 

I can feel this pain is real I never wanted anything from you, you 

And it makes me glad 
When I see the sun 
And it makes me sad 
When you feel my one 
And I thank my god 
Got a girl like you 
And I thank my god 
Did you save me 

Time to see, believe this in me 
This pain that I feel deep inside
