Ain't I got you on my back foot
And you know I got to feeling good
Cause there's something deep inside of me
I got to be

And if you find it hard to follow me
If I loose you in my creative stream
Than you only got to raise your eyes
And see me fly

Don't tell me that I won't
I will
Don't tell me that I'm not
I am
Don't tell me that my master plan
Ain't coming through

Don't tell me that I won't
I will
Don't tell me how to think
I fell
Don't tell me cause I know what's real
What I can do

Something that you don't see every day
A little girl who has found her way
In world that tries to take away
All of your dreams

I think there's one thing I will say to you
That there is nothing that you can't do
Cause it's all about your attitude
Don't let them get to you

Don't tell me that I won't
I will
Don't tell me that I'm not
I am
Don't tell me that my master plan
Ain't coming through

Don't tell me that I won't
I will
Don't tell me how to think
I fell
Don't tell me cause I know what's real
What I can do

And when we're singing it out our voice
We can make that choice to be free

And when we're singing it out our voice
We can make that choice to be free

Music, hey, I love it
Yeah, yes, I do
Music, now, now, now, what
I love it, yes, I do

Don't tell me that I won't
I will
Don't tell me that I'm not
I am
Don't tell me that my master plan
Ain't coming through

Don't tell me that I won't
I will
Don't tell me how to think
I fell
Don't tell me cause I know what's real
What I can do

Free me
Free me
Free me
Free me
