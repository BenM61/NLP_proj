[Sean paul]
I fill a big bank, and drank drank
That's why I got a purpe sprite, and why'all ain't
I ride big rims, seein me is tallest
So when ya step down, baby gurl don't fall
Why'all niggas know the name, they call me Sean paul
And I ain't got no flowers to sell, breakin the law
Niggas call me dope, 'cause I'm hard and I'm raw
Can't call me dat fiend wasn't here to make ya coffin
Its always beside me, watch got diamonds
I ain't part timin, I'm full time grindin
The nigga wasn't shinin, live nigga blindin
Niggas wit da dimes in da whips that I be ridin
And I don't pull em out, until the trunk beat
And ya can see ya movie sittin in the back seat
They wild on the east, they live in these streets
So imma keep my piece sittin on the front seat
