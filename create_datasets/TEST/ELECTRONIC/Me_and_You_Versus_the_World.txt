I first met you hanging knickers on the line
From that moment on I knew
That there could only be one outcome
Me and you against the world forever
You have no folks and I'm just a joke
But we made a vow that we would never sell each other out
A lie detector wouldn't make me doubt you
Now we know that it's us versus the world now
Me and you against the world now
Look up there in the sky now
See the stars well they're shining just for us
Hey now me and you against the world now
Look up there in the sky now
See the stars well they're shining just for us
We hitched a ride that would turn out suicide
I had my .45 replica gun
I didn't think we'd ever need it
Didn't know he had a real one loaded
You went in first took the worst
Couldn't hear me shouting you to stop
Above the busy traffic passing by
We promised that together we would die
Now we know that it's us versus the world now
Me and you against the world now
Look up there in the sky now
See the stars well they're shining just for us
Hey now me and you against the world now
Look up there in the sky now
See the stars well they're shining just for us
I went in next took a bullet in the chest?
So I hit him with the only thing that was anywhere near me?
A tin of baked beans and a Womans Weekly
I got the cash picked you up and made a dash we didn't make it
Too far we made it to the parking lot 40 cops in front of us?
Guess who got shot
Lying there dying in each others arms oh you said to me
Don't worry about a thing my little sweetheart
We're together we shall never be apart
You took a chance on a loser like me
But you never let me down
And whether we were in heaven or hell
I know it's better than separate cells
Now we know it's us versus the world now
Me and you against the world now
Look up there in the sky now
See the stars well they're shining just for us
Hey now me and you against the world now
Look up there in the sky now
See the stars
Well they're shining just for us
