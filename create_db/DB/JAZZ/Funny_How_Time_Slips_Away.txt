Well hello there,
It's been a long long time
How am I doing?
Oh well, I guess I'm doing fine
It's been so long now and it seems that
It was only yesterday 
Ain't it funny how time slips away?

How's your new love, 
I hope that he's doing fine 
Heard you told him
That you'd love him till the end of time
Well you know, that's the same thing
That you told me
Well it seems like just the other day 
Ain't it funny how time slips away 

Gotta go now
Guess I'll see you hanging round
Don't know when though
Never know when I'll be back in town
But remember what I told you
That in time your gonna pay
Well it's surprisin' how time slips away
Yeah, ain't it surprisin' how time slips away
