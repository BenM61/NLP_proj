If I give you my love, what will you give in
Return, if I give you my love
Will you cause my heart to yearn, and will it bring
Me sadness, with so many tears
And will it bring me gladness, all through out the
Years

if I give you my word, will you give me your word
Too
If I vow to yours, promises me that you'll be true
Am I playing with fire, tell me are you concerned,
If I give you my love
What will you give in return

Am I playing with fire, tell me are you concerned
It I give you my love, what will you give in return
