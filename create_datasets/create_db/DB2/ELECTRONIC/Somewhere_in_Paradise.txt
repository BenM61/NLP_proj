The sun is low,
It's time to go
Gone are the peaceful days,
The tide is turning.

But when we part tonight
The stars will shine so bright
Though in so many ways
This world is burning.

Somewhere in paradise
A bright new sun will rise
Above the two of us united there forever.
You'll never die again,
I'll never cry again
We'll live for love somewhere in paradise together.

How do girls try
A cool good-bye
When all the war bells chime
That you must leave me

This farewell afternoon
Why did it come so soon?
I'll trust the face of time
That will deceive me.

Somewhere in paradise
A bright new sun will rise
Above the two of us united there forever.
You'll never die again,
I'll never cry again
We'll live for love somewhere in paradise together.

Somewhere in paradise
I'll kiss your velvet eyes
And all the heartaches of this world 
Will soon be fading.
Here's what I'll do, my love
I'll wait for you, my love,
Until up there, somewhere in paradise we're staying.
