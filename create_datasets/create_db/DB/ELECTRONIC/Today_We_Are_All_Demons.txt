Without pain, life is not worth livin'.

(*random bird*... *moAN* It's Evil!)

We're all demons today,
Come down and feel the pain
Burst right through you,
And makes a hole in your soul.
I don't care what you been told and now I carry you,
And as a soldier of misfortune and ultimate doomsayer;
I want you to feel,
And I know you will,
And everything you see will bleed straight through reveal the truth. 
Anything can happen you say,
I never tried to get it,
I never tried to fit in,
And now I'm falling through.

Fire,
When ready,
READY,
FIRE!!

I'm human too you know,
Everything,
Soul's dead.
I'm human too you know,
Talented,
Scavengers.
I'll hold you down you'll be my,
Bait I'll throw you to my,
Slaves that stick to my lies and everything is shallow.
I know there's no use to pray,
I am a demon today,
We're all demons today
We drown in soil we're flooded
As it happens,
I'm still trying to be human,
I never tried to fit in now I'm falling through again.

Fire,
When ready,
READY,
FIRE!!

Fire when ready, ready, fire.
Fire when ready, ready, fire.

Without pain, life is not worth livin'.

(No! Don't touch it! It's evil!)
