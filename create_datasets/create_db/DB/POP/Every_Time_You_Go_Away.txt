Hey!, if we can solve any problem
Then why do we lose so many tears
Oh, and so you go again
When the leading man appears
Always the same thing
Can't you see, we've got everything goin' on and on and on

Every time you go away you take a piece of me with you
Every time you go away you take a piece of me with you

Go on and go free, yeah
Maybe you're too close to see
I can feel your body move
It doesn't mean that much to me
I can't go on sayin' the same thing
Just can't you see, we've got everything do you even know we know

Every time you go away you take a piece of me with you, oh
Every time you go away you take a piece of me with you

I can't go on sayin' the same thing
'Cause baby, can'tcha see, we've got everything goin' on and on and on

Every time you go away you take a piece of me with you
Every time you go away you take a piece of me with you

Looking at the pieces (Every time you go away)
Be careful (You take a piece of me with you)
(Every time  you go away) Every time you go, every time you go
(You take a piece of me with you) You take a piece of me!
(Every time you go away you take a piece of me with you) Every time you go!
