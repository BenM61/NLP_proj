Every night when the moon is shining bright 
Down in Rio Janeiro 
Comes a gent with a mellow instrument 
And a colorful sombrero 

Then he sings and the melody he brings 
So tenderly played 
Is called the Gaucho Serenade 
Si senor, he's a happy troubadour, 

On a patio you'll find him 
Si senor, he will go from door to door 
Leaving happiness behind him 
All the sweet senoritas hurry out 

To join the parade 
And hear the Gaucho Serenade 
The Gaucho Serenade...
