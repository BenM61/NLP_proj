Rolling and tumbling ain't done me no harm
Gonna boogie my night all away
Rita and Greta been twisting my arm into
Heading out west
Down to the Burlesque
Saving my ace through to you

Well, drinking and sinking, I'm feeling alright
Right down to my snakey spat shoes
Just about shutdown and three in the night
Because I'm heading out west
Down to the Burlesque
Show 'em a moon at the door

We got to show the Burlesque

Rolling, tumbling
Sure ain't done me no harm
Drinking, sinking
Just been too bad on my arm

Well I finally lost Rita and Greta went home
I guess that leaves just me and you
Been kinda sneaky to get you alone
Oh but you in that dress
Destination Burlesque
I got all my cards in one shoe

I got all my cards in one

Rolling, tumbling
Sure ain't done me no harm
Drinking, sinking
Just been too bad on my arm

Well I finally lost Rita and Greta went home
I guess that leaves just me and you
Been kinda sneaky to get you alone
Oh but you in that dress
Destination Burlesque
I got all my cards in one shoe
