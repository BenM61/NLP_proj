I'm gonna wait til the midnight hour
That's when my love comes tumbling down
I'm gonna wait til the midnight hour
When there's no one else around
I'm gonna take you girl and hold you
And do all the things I told you in the midnight hour
Yeah in the midnight hour

I'm gonna wait til stars come out
And see that twinkle in your eyes
I'm gonna wait til the midnight hour
That's when my love begins to shine
You'll be the only girl I'll love
And really Love you so
In the midnight hour
Oh yeah in the midnight hour
