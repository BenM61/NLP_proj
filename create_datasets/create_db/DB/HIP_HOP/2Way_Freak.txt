They call me the juice
The no chicken lover
A gigglo at night
Dats always in trouble
I cruise around the city
I'm rollin' up the sticky
I'm ridin' 22's
And I love big titties
Gel and weave

If she from the hood
Then she down wit me
She got gel and weave
Gel and weave
Wit a big round ass
I'm yo man to be
As I'm rollin' down the block
A player gotta beep
That said i want to f*ck
A two way freak
Her name is Rhonda Peary
Who works at the dairy
Her chewin' is da bomb
But her face looks scary
I'm pushin' down the street
Tryin' to make it to her house
And then i gotta beep from my freak
Named Minnie Mouse
They call her Minnie Mouse
She live a couple trees
She eat a lot of cheese
If you hit she'll squeak

Watchu doin' unless its just
Goin' to the bathroom
Two way on the TV
Come back

Tryin' to see who's beepin' me
Dog that's a no, no
Get yo stuff you gotta go
Scrollin' threw my two way

Don't know how to act
Gotta two way on yo collar
Askin' can you get a beep
Hell naw, not at all

Throw my junk into the wall

Or you when like you responded
