The Ding-Dong Daddy of the D-car line
Had a thing for the ladies for which he did time
He reaped a little more than he could sow
Of the pleasures the Mormons in Utah know
He could not restrain himself when he saw
a nice caboose

Say Ding
Say Dong
That Ding-Dong Daddy he did
sixteen women wrong

The Ding-Dong Daddy had a sensual soul
Lonely women flocked to him and he
loved them all
The train went in the tunnel in the
dark he proposed
The bonds of matrimony in the sweetest prose
The ladies got together and decided
they'd been had
This ain't Salt Lake and you ain't Don Juan man
We've got to give you credit we was
happy for a time
But you're the Ding-Dong Daddy of the D-car line

Say Ding
Say Dong
That Ding-Dong Daddy he did
sixteen women wrong
