Here is a story of three young people
A girl and two boys
She's got American eyes
American eyes

They left school for fame and fortune
But she was the one
The girl with the stars in her eyes
Stars and stripes in her eyes

I was one of the boys
Oh how I loved her
But she wouldn't see me
She shut her apple pie eyes
As blue as Jamaica skies

And oh unrequited love quite often grows
And never quite goes

He was one of the boys
He joined the army
He sailed from American shores
To fight the foreigners' wars

Baby shut your eyes up tight
I swear the world won't end tonight
And when we die our spirits fly
Into the light above the sky
