Fairy tale, my favorite fairy tale is the one I live with wonderful you,
Life is so grand, a fabulous fairyland, and we walk it hand in hand as lovers do,
Fantasy became a reality, with your tender kiss you open the door,

You are marvelous, divine, Aladdin's lamp did shine,
The magic days that you were mine,
Fairy tale, our love is a fairy tale, and it never has been told before.
