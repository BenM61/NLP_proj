Every single time you take me out with you 
You always flirt around with someone new 
But I never criticize the tearful things you do 
'Cause I'm so afraid of losing you 

But in my lonely room, tears I don't have to hide 
'Cause I just lock my door and let myself go 
And lay right down and cry 

Every place we go, people are whispering 
About your flirting ways, & it hurts me so to hear 
But in the public's eye I just push behind all my hurt inside 
And pretend i don't mind 

But in my lonely room, tears I don't have to hide 
In my lonely lonely lonely lonely room 
I push my pride aside and lay right down & cry 
In my lonely room, in my lonely room 
Let myself go, lay right down and cry
