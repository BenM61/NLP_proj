Cleo, Cleo, won't you come around and play girl
Cleo, Cleo, won't you come around and stay girl

You can find the lines to say, if you try
Someone else has just confessed
To drinking up all your wine.

Cleo, Cleo, there's a way for you to find out
How you should say, what you think is the way out
Will you, won't you, will you see me through
Maybe you could help me find a thing or two about you.

Cleo, Cleo, now's the time for you to tell me
If you, want to, you can leave it up to me girl
After you have told me what you want to do
I could tell you, that I loved you, if I thought that it would be true.

Cleo, Cleo, Oh Cleo I want you, me oh my.
Oh Cleo I want you, me oh my.
