We 
Lay on our backs in the grass
Silently watching the rain clouds 
Move by far too fast

And you know

Or broken inside 
All that is fine
All that is fine

We burn our boats each new year
Silently watching the flames 
And an old life disappear
We're burning a new sunrise into 
Yesterday's skies
An ashen fingerprint
Melts into the sea

Yeah we do
We don't feel sad or bad or blue
And you know
We're never defeated
Or broken inside
All that is fine
Yeah, all that is fine

We're doing fine now
Of course we do
We don't feel sad or bad or blue
And now you know
We're never defeated
Or broken inside
All that is fine
All that is fine

Anything to feel
Anything inside
Anything
