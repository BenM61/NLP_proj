You stood by me in my darkest hour
And you give all your heart in my time of sorrow
When I was down in bad time you come to me in the night
And you eased my mind
Now I'm here to tell the world I know
There ain't nothin' like a woman with soul

When I was lyin on a sick bed
You stood beside me with a wet rag and bathed my forehead
And I want all you people to know
There ain't nothin' like a woman with soul
Yeah, I've got to tell everybody that I know
There ain't nothin' like a woman withsoul

Now I'll never know how I live without ya
Cause you give so much of yourself
And that's what I love about ya
And I've got to tell the world I know
There ain't nothin' like a woman with soul
Now, I want all the people to know
There ain't nothin' like a woman with soul
