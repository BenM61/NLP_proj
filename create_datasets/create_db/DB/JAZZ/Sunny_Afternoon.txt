Tax man's taken all my dough
And left me in my stately home
Lazing on a sunny afternoon
And I can't sail my yacht
He's taken everything I've got
And all I've got's this sunny afternoon

Save me, save me, save me from this squeeze
I gotta big fat mama tryin' to break me
But I love to live so pleasantly, live this life of luxury
Lazing on a sunny afternoon
In the summertime, in the summertime

My boyfriend's run off with my car
And gone back to his ma and pa
Telling tales of drunkenness and cruelty
I am sitting here, sipping on my ice cold beer
Lazing on a sunny afternoon

Help me, help me, help me sail away
Oh, give me two good reasons why I oughta stay
'Cause I love to live so pleasantly, live this life of luxury
Lazing on a sunny afternoon
In the summertime, in the summertime

Save me, save me, save me from this squeeze
I gotta big fat mama tryin', oh tryin' to break me
'Cause I love to live so pleasantly, live this life of luxury
Lazing on a sunny afternoon, yeah
In the summertime, in the summertime
In the summertime, in the summertime

In the summertime, in the summertime
In the, in the, in the summertime
In the summertime
