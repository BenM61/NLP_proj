They fall from your mouth
Propelled by your belly and your tongue
I shiver when you shake
And I fold into jelly
I think I loved you more than me

Are you human
Or a dud
Are you human
Or do you make it up

My baby cherry slipped
Pass me through your fingertips
Throw me down like an old rag
I'm not standing
Don't look back

Are you human
Or a dog
Are you human
Or do you make it up
Are you human
Or a dud
Are you human
Or do you make it up

They went searching 
For your body
They went looking
But there's nobody
Who smells like you
Who looks like you
You're not human, too

Are you human
Or a dog
Are you human
Or do you make it up
Are you human
Or a dud
Are you human
Or do you make it up

(are you human)
