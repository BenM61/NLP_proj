Tears of sorrow, tears of joy
Oh come at once for the sweetest boy
(Nobody knows)
That's the price that the boy has paid
To choose not to be afraid

That's the price that the girl has paid
Oh for all the promises she made
(You look pretty good)
She is triple hep 'n' blue
She'll never ever know what's true

Fallout of love
It's the fallout of love
(What you want and you need)
Do right, they do wrong, they understand
That they're never ever ever ever gonna win

These are the better times
(Oh yeah darlin'!)
I'm a hetero-genius
I wanna testify (ooh)
But she does it but she doesn't understand

Faithless now I just got soul (baby)
Ooh look at the girl go (baby)
Oh look at the girl go
She looks so fine (so fine)

Do you do you do (baby)
Do you do you do
(But you looks so good)
Do you do
Do you do
Do you do

Oh who coulda seen it
(Who coulda heard)
Who coulda told them
(Who coulda known)

Oh who coulda seen it
(Who coulda heard)
Who coulda told them
(Who coulda known)

They do it but they never understand

Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me now

Tears of sorrow, tears of joy
Oh come at once for the sweetest boy
(Nobody knows)
That's the price that the boy has paid
To choose not to be afraid

Fallout of love
Ow! The fallout, baby, fallout of love
(Nobody knows)
The girl is righteous and she understands why

These are the better times
All the boys down at the club
They say "Now she must be something"
I said "You don't know the half of it Jack!"

She does it but she doesn't understand
