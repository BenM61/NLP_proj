There's a crowd talking loud but they ain't saying nothing
Slow and stale weak and pale while we're running and laughing
Cause there's something else something bright and pure something that you've never felt before
Something you can't touch something you can't see you just don't belive

Don't you die yet first class riot
You can't buy it first class riot

You don't know where to go still you point out directions
Black and white so uptight while we run for perfection
Cause there's something else something bright and pure something that you've never felt before
Something you can't touch something you can't see you just don't believe

Don't you die yet first class riot
You can't buy it first class riot...
