Wait, till the sun goes down, then we'll go walkin', down by the sea,
It's been a long time, for my girl and me

Take a trip, down by the shore, throwing stones out across the beach,
It's been a long time, for my girl and me,

Ain't no use just sittin' around at home drinking and watching t.v.,
No it ain't, oh, no, no,
Got to get out in the air, walk for a spell, hand in hand, just her and me,
Been a long time, since the party where we met, danced all night, just my girl and me,

Well, our dog's pretty small and fluffy but it sure run's fast when I throw the ball,
Up and down the beach, and my girl is laughin', hair's in her eyes,
And she blows me a kiss across the shore, mimes she loves me,
Sun's disappearing now might as well go back home, get in the car, go for a ride, yeah,

Turn the key, and the engine roars, make a signal, find a gear,
There's a highway, for my girl and me,

Through the town, where the lights are bright, to the country, out into the night,
Find a quiet spot, and we make it right,

Ah, far from the noise of the bars and the traffic we ride, that's where we go,
Ah, to look down from the hills at the sea and the valleys below,
There's boats in the harbor and people makin' their way home,

Well, we stop for a while hand in hand, as we walk from the car,
She kisses my cheek and tells me she'll always be mine, yes she will,
The night's nearly day as I drive her back home to her ma.
