You know I told you once tonight
That you could always speak your mind
You work so hard to say what's right
I watch you do it all the time

And when I called you on the phone
You said that I could be the one
But here I'm standing all alone
And you're out lying in the sun

Tell me, am I getting in too deep
Every night I'm talking in my sleep
Lately I am so confused
I really don't know what to do

Could you be the one I'm thinking of
Could you be the girl I really love
All the people tell me so
But what do all the people know

You know I told you once tonight
That you could always speak your mind
You work so hard to say what's right
I watch you do it all the time

And when I called you on the phone
You said that I could be the one
But here I'm standing all alone
And you're out lying in the sun

Tell me, am I getting in too deep
Every night I'm talking in my sleep
Lately we're just holding on
To something that will soon be gone

Could you be the one I'm thinking of
Could you be the girl I really love
All the people tell me so
But what do all the people know

Do you think I'm blind to what you do
Do you think I really care for you
Or is it just another game that you and I pretend to play
Do you think we both should let it show
Do you think we both should let it go
Or is it just another game that you and I pretend to play

Tell me, am I getting in too deep
Every night I'm talking in my sleep
Lately I am so confused
I really don't know what to do

Could you be the one I'm thinking of
Could you be the girl I really love
All the people tell me so
But what do all the people know

All the people tell me so
But what do all the people know
All the people tell me so
But what do all the people know
