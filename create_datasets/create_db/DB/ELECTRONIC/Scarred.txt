You ever get the feeling that everything
In America is completely f***ed up

The choice you make will be your own
A pattern forms, too scarred to feel
Too scared to follow and so am I
Wisdom will cower and so will I

Words breed lies
Beneath it all
The death in your veins
The life on your knees

The rain will wash me away
All structures collapse
Nothing covers my grave
Only destruction remains

Words breed lies
Beneath it all
The death in your veins
The life on your knees

The rain will wash me away
All structures collapse
Nothing covers my grave
Only destruction remains

The rain will wash me away
All structures collapse
Nothing covers my grave
Only destruction remains

You ever get the feeling that everything
In America is completely f***ed up

The rain will wash me away
All structures collapse
Nothing covers my grave
Only destruction remains

The rain will wash me away
All structures collapse
Nothing covers my grave
Only destruction remains
