He used to wear fedoras
Now he sports a fez
There's cabalistic innuendoes
In everything he says
Sucking at a cigarette
Picking up a thread
Underneath the Casablanca Moon

He lurks behind a paper
In the shadow of a mosque
He can't count all the continents
He's crossed
Trailing party-members leaving
Footprints in the frost
Underneath the Acnalbasac Noom

His cover was broken somewhere
In Hoboken the man said his
Case was lost
He was sent to the Orient
A double agent double crossed
There's a cocaine stain on his moustache
The pieces of his puzzle just don't join
People in high places want to stamp his
Many faces on a trans-caucasian coin
He'd better watch his step 'cause sooner or
Later they'll find his headless body in 
A ventilator

Lines of sweat like tinsel start to smart his eyes
Neurosis seeps like cement through the cracks in his disguise
In a dark bordello he cracked a mirror with his cries
Underneath the Casablanca Moon

Yesterday evening he finally lost his mind
The walls fell in & all mankind
Was standing before him all raising their hands
In a significant gesture which he didn't understand

His cover was broken somewhere
In Hoboken the man said his
Case was lost
He was sent to the Orient
A double agent double crossed

He used to wear fedoras
Now he sports a fez
There's cabalistic innuendoes
In everything he says
Sucking at a cigarette
Picking up a thread
Underneath the Casablanca Moon

He'd better watch his step 'cause sooner or
Later they'll find his headless body in 
A ventilator
