Fun
When I party, I party hearty
Fun is on my mind

Fun
Put a smile on your face
Leave that bummer behind

Fun
There's a sister and there's a brother
Havin' fun with each other

Fun
Daddy always hangs up the boys
He just wants to party with mother

A private thought cannot be bought
But you know what you have to do
Sock it unto others
As you would have them sock it to you

Fun
When I party, I party hearty
Fun is on my mind

Fun
Put a smile on your face
Leave that bummer behind

Fun
There's a sister and there's a brother
Havin' fun with each other

Fun
Daddy always hangs up the boys
He just wants to party with mother

Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun

When I party, I party hearty
Fun is on my mind
Put a smile on your face
Leave your bummer behind
