Midday in the underground, 
There's a teenage girl selling music for her bed 
I'll be the one that you look upon 
And thank your lucky stars 
That you walk in your own shoes 

Clip clop past a sleeping bag 
And a woolly hat 
Lying open on the ground 
Give money and sympathy, 
Hold your little girl 
Like you won't see her again 

Does anyone know, the places you go 

On a day like today 
I drink champagne from a straw 
And I get my own way, 
He loves me above them all 
And there's no such thing as poor little rich girls 
On a day like today 

I've got my all over tan 
And my tummy tuck, 
My two babies boy and girl 
Big house in the country 
With expensive bags 
For my scary little dog 

My man sleeps around a bit, 
Keeps him from my bed, 
One less job for me to do 
I'm the one you look up to 
And wish on every star 
For one day in my high shoes 

Can anyone hear, it's hollow in here 

On a day like today 
I drink champagne from a straw 
And I get my own way, 
He chose me above them all 
And there's no such thing as poor little rich girls 
In a day like today A day like today 

A day like today A day like today 

Can anyone hear, it's hollow in here 

On a day like today 
I drink champagne from a straw 
And I get my own way, 
He loves me above them all 
And there's no such thing as poor little rich girls 
On a day like today 

I drink champagne from a straw 
And I get my own way, 
He loves me above them all 
And there's no such thing as poor little rich girls 
On a day like today
