Now take me to a house, tease me, then please me 
And tell all her friends how the dick made her sleepy
And believe me, when I'm up in there I'm beatin' it
Givin' ya that Mike Jones' treatment 
I could tell by the way she walk that she got it 
Body so delit, you can tell when she drop it

I've seen her walk by me, damn near passed out 
Then crept up behind her, tell her it was time to 
Let a playa like me get in that vagina

Where them hoes like to get buckin' bald 
And can't take off they drawers 
Ain't standin' now nigga, naw 
I love the way she dance, she look like she fuckin' herself

Freaky ways she can shake ass for days 
Then kick it in sixty-nine different ways 
Jump onstage, she get paid she goes off 
You got enough money she taking the clothes off

Make a booty roll take her clothes off 
And she love smokin' weed 
And she getting hella freaky on the ecstasy 
Do her dance for me song after song

Now that's a girl who know what she want and like 
She a schoolgirl by day and a stripper by night
