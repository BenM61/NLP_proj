Don't bother me with your customs cards 
I got nothing from abroad 
No romance, no precious stones 
No sexy stories to take home 

I went to Cairo 
I went to Spain 
I swam across the Magellan Strait 
I looked for love 
And all I got was this lousy t-shirt 

I've got nothing to declare 
Except my loneliness 
I've got nothing to declare 
N-O-T-H-I-N-G 
Nothing of value here 

Do your strip search, call your dogs 
Spread my legs against the wall 
Search my bags, check my soul 
My total value is zero 

I went to Tokyo 
I went to Spain 
I walked across the African Plains 
I looked for love 
And all I got was this lousy t-shirt 

I've got nothing to declare 
Except my loneliness 
I've got nothing to declare 
N-O-T-H-I-N-G 
No fruit, no plants, no animals 
No currency, no thing commercial 
I've got nothing to declare 
Nothing of value here 

I'm a failed explorer with empty hands 
A Don Quixote with jet lag 

I've got nothing to declare 
Except my love not used 
I've got nothing to declare 
N-O-T-H-I-N-G 
No fruit, no plants, no animals 
No currency, no thing commercial 
I've got nothing to declare 
Nothing of value here
