It's really more than I can say
Lookin' at this tower
Angels are off duty and asleep
In these wee hours

And there's no place I can go
And this noise inside my head
It comes and it goes
It comes and it goes

There's really nothing you can stop
So I guess I'm gonna try
Climbing up this tower
Walking up the stones
Stocking feet, to the clock

This is one place that I know
And the face in front of me
It comes and it goes
It comes and it goes

Not some lucky charm
But something to hold onto
That could hold onto me

And there's no place I can go
And this noise inside my head
It comes and it goes
It comes and it goes
It comes and it goes
