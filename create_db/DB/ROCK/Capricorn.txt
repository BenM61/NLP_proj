A thousand nights, I've spent alone
Solitaire, to the bone
But I don't mind, I'm my own best friend
From the beginning, to the end
My life, my heart, black night, my star
Capricorn
Capricorn

December's child, the only one
What I do, is what I've done
I realize, I get so cold
When I was young I was already old
My life, my heart, black night, my star
Capricorn

Capricorn
Go!

I always knew, the only way
Is never live, beyond today
They proved me right
They proved me wrong
But they could never last this long
My life, my heart, black night, my star
Capricorn
