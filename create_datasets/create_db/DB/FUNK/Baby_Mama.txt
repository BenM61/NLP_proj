It's about time we had our own song
Don't know what took so long
'cause now-a-days it like a badge of honer
To be a baby mama
I see ya payin' ya bills
I see ya workin' ya job

And girl I know it's hard
And even though ya fed up
With makin' beds up
Girl, keep ya head up
All my

I see you get that support check in the mail
Ya open it and your like "What the Hell"
You say "This ain't even half of daycare"
Sayin' to yourself "This here ain't fair"
And all my girls who don't get no help
Who gotta do everything by yourself
Remember: What don't kill you can only make you stronger
My baby mama

'cause we the backbone (of the hood)
I always knew that (that we could)
We can go anywhere, we can do anything
I know we can make it if we dream
And I think it should be a holiday
For single mothers tryin' to make a way
But until then
Here is your song
Show love to my
