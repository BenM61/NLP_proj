June, 
What are you crying for? 
Soon you'll have to end this war 
The days are turning darker now 
But hang an to that dream somehow

June 
Where are you going to? 
True, the game got rough on you 
Things have turned so sad inside 
But hang on to that dream you hide

On and On
The dark will find you
Rain will fall
And clouds surround you
But carry on,
My love's behind you
I know I'll see you smiling

June 
You'd better stand up, girl
Soon you'll have to face the world 
I know you'll find a place somewhere 
You'll put things back together there

On and On 
The dark will find you
Rain will fall
And clouds surround you
But carry on,
My love's behind you
I know I'll see you smiling         

The days are rolling faster now   
But you will find your peace somehow
