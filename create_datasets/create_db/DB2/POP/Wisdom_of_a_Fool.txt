If you're lucky enough to have someone who loves you
Then be glad that you've got someone who loves you
'Cause the lips that were warm can grow cool
Listen to the wisdom of a fool

When you take her poor heart and you do something to it
And you think to yourself, oh, why did I do it
You may find that the world can be cruel
Listen to the wisdom of a fool

Now I had a love just the same as you
And I was a fool not to see
But you still have time to say you love her
I'm afraid it's too late for me

So go back to the arms that you know will be waiting
Hold her close in your arms and be glad that she's waiting
You'll be happy, believe me, if you'll
Only listen to the wisdom of a fool
