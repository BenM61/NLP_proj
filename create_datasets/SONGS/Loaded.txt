Tripping on the sidewalk living like a cyclone
What's that in your heart?
Guess I never know where you go
Harsh words in the headlamps
Time to leave

Racing like a psycho walking on a tightrope
Funky like a monkey with my makeup running
Too proud to find no time to breathe

My baby's always threatening to leave
You can do that or be here
Almost brought me down to my knees
You said I've never been clear
Honey you better believe
Now that there's nothing to fear
You can just leave

Talking like I'm tanked up
Reading from the black book
Everyone you know is a roady-go sinner
You look away as they crucify me
Sleeping in the wreckage
Loaded like a weapon
Bombing down jacina like the end is coming
I prophesize you'll miss the highs with me

My baby's always threatening to leave
You can do that or be here
Almost brought me down to my knees
You said I've never been clear
Honey you better believe
Now that there's nothing to fear
You can just leave

Would you say my prayers
If I can't hear every pair
You can be in all black
'Cause you're never gonna get it clean
When it's easier to leave (bye, bye)
When it's easier to leave (too tired to try to let it go)

My baby's always threatening to leave
You can do that or be here
Almost brought me down to my knees (too tired to try to let it go)
You said I've never been clear
Honey you better believe
Now that there's nothing to fear
You can just leave (too tired to try to let it go)

Too tired to try to let it go
Too tired to try to let it go
Too tired to try to let it go
Too tired to try to let it go
