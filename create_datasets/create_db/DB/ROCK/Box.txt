I live in a box. I live on a one way street, but I don't mind.
'Cause I live alone. Nobody has to share my home.
And if I could choose I might pick a bigger box
My home on the range is underneath my black hat
But that's all I'd change, until I get a credit card
Until I wake up
I will not be watching you so you should not be watching me
I've got what I need. I've got a car that doesn't work.

I've got blood to bleed. I've got a bar of soap. I've got shampoo too

I won the Nobel Prize. I made a thinner dime.
So I look like me but I smell like you.
You know I'll get my act together when I find the time
But right now I think that living is a place to lie down.

You see I rule the dirt, so I'm the king of this town.
I live in the dark. I live in the silence, and I can say
And if I could choose I might pick a darker void
My home on the range is somewhere in the closet,
That I see and hear how much more than the average bear
But that's all I'd change, until I get a bigger club

Until I wake up.
I will not be watching you so you should not be watching me
So here's what we've got. You tell me what I am.

I'll tell you what I am. We'll both scratch our heads
I'll tell you what I am not. You tell me what I'm not.
Like we give a damn. Please tell me who comes out ahead
Was it me or you? Was it me or you? (probably you)
I live in my skull. I'm under my eyelids. You can't touch me.

'Cause I'm fast asleep. You wouldn't like the friends I keep.
But that's all I'd change, until I get a safe way out.
And I could choose I might pick a larger head
And don't you dare wake me up.My home on the range is right behind my eyeballs.
