Chickens a-crowin' on Sourwood Mountain
Hey, ho, diddle-um day
So many pretty girls I can't count 'em
Hey ho, diddle-um day

My true love's a blue-eyed daisy
She won't come and I'm too lazy

Big dog bark and little one bite you
Big girl court and little one spite you

My true love's a blue-eyed daisy
If I don't get her, I'll go crazy

My true love lives at the head of the holler
She won't come and I won't foller

My true love lives over the river
A few more jumps and I'll be with her

Ducks in the pond, geese in the ocean
Devil's in the women if they take a notion
