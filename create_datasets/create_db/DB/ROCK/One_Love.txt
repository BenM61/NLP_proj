One looks for happiness
One longs to find a partner
One knows that nowadays
One love will be the answer

One sees a crazy world
One needs a fresh perspective
One comes to realize
One love's a true objective

One seeks a perfect verb
One learns to tell the difference
One finds in consequence
One love is all that makes sense

One hopes there'll be a way
One peers into the distance
One thinks that come what may
One love will be the best chance

One love, and only one
One love to last forever
One love, only one love
One love, it's now or never

One tries to draw a line
One draws a swift conclusion
One tells oneself in life
One love is the solution

One falls in love at last
One celebrates the meeting
One always will because
One love cannot be beaten

One love, and only one
One love with no misgivings
One love, only one love
One love, while we're still living

One tries to draw a line
One draws a swift conclusion
One tells oneself in life
One love is the solution

One falls in love at last
One celebrates the meeting
One always will because
One love cannot be beaten

One love, and only one
One love to last forever
One love, only one love
One love, it's now or never

One love, and only one
One love with no misgivings
One love, only one love
One love, while we're still living
