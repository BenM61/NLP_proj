Life,
mysterious life
we're all moving around
dancing the rhythm of life

Time,
mysterious time
we're all counting the hours and days
'till the end of all time 

Were all feeling the change
but we don't know why
choose one direction just one for time
don't say I'm thinking too much
if you see what's behind 

And these are mysterious times 
Mysterious times 
No trick of the mind 
For this moment I feel
like we live in
mysterious times 
If you see what's behind
these are mysterious times 

Soul
I feel my soul
for this moment
nobody can stop me from flying so high 

Real
I feel so real
in a world of illusion
you only see what you feel 

Were all feeling the change
but we don't know why
choose one direction just one for time
don't say I'm thinking too much
if you see what's behind 

And these are mysterious times 
Mysterious times 
No trick of the mind 
For this moment I feel
like we live in
mysterious times 

If you see what's behind
these are mysterious times 
If you see what's behind
these are mysterious times
