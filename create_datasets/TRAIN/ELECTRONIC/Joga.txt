All these accidents
That happen
Follow the dot
Coincidence

Makes sense
Only with you
You don't have to speak
I feel

Emotional landscapes
They puzzle me
Then the riddle gets solved
And you push me up to this

State of emergency
How beautiful to be
State of emergency
Is where I want to be

All that no-one sees
You see
What's inside of me
Every nerve that hurts

You heal
Deep inside of me, oo-oohh
You don't have to speak
I feel

Emotional landscapes
They puzzle me confuse
Then the riddle gets solved
And you push me up to this

State of emergency
How beautiful to be
State of emergency
Is where I want to be

State of emergency
How beautiful to be

Emotional landscapes
They puzzle me
Then the riddle gets solved
And you push me up to this

State of emergency

State of emergency
Is where I want to be

State of emergency
How beautiful to be

State of, state of
How beautiful
Emergency
Is where I want to be
