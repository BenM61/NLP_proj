See how the western kids
Have silicon inside their lips
A mask or an artifice
For the love that their parents give
The northern girls they play the part
With painted face, they're works of art
I swear to god I felt it then
The perfumed aura of wine and gin

I just love this I swear I'll go viral
From the burbs' to the streets now, it's a revival
The spirit is found in the idealistically idle
The age of excess
And I just love it
I just love it
I just love it

The midwestern plains recall
Firearms and alcohol
The proxy-server kind of men
The socialites they're brooding hens
The silhouettes they play the part
Their east coast digs are works of art
But the sickness sleeps inside our bones
With solipsistic overtones

I just love this I swear I'll go viral
From the burbs' to the streets now, it's a revival
The spirit is found in the idealistically idle
The age of excess
And I just love it yeah
I just love it yeah
I just love it yeah
