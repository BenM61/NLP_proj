Here we go again
He's back in town again
I'll take him back again
One more time

Here we go again
The phone will ring again
I'll be her fool again, I will
One more time

I've been there before
But I will try it again
Any fool, any fool knows
That there's no, no way to win

Here we go again
She'll break my heart again
I'll play the part again
One more time

I've been there before
But you know what? I'll try it again
But any fool, any fool knows
That there's no, no way to win

Here we go again
She'll break my heart again
I'll play the part again
One more time

I'll take her back again
One more time

I will
