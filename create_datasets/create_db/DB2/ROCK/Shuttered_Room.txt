All I feel is the shuttered room
The striped light of detention
All I smell is shattered bone
Far too relevant to mention

In the shuttered room
In my shuttered room
In my shuttered room
In my shuttered room

Small holes where lead kissed the walls
This is no crime of passion
How many died without a cause
Could it be pure invention

In the shuttered room
In the shuttered room
In the shuttered room
In the shuttered room

Shuttered shuttered shuttered shuttered room
In my shuttered room
Shuttered shuttered shuttered shuttered room
In the shuttered room

The whimpered truths of the shuttered room
Mean so little as we reflect
Over bodies who fell in the pile
You know how the story is vile

In the shuttered room
In the shuttered room
In the shuttered room
In the shuttered room

Shuttered shuttered shuttered shuttered
Shuttered shuttered shuttered shuttered
Shuttered shuttered shuttered shuttered

Room
In my shuttered room
In my shuttered room
