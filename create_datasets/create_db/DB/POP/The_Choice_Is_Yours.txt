Lately I've had my doubts
About the way you feel
Tell me there is no other love
You see but me, oh
I've been a good woman to you
Give you my sweet love every night
Break up, make up
That's all that we do
So if you better want me love
You've got to go down

The choice is yours
The choice is yours
The choice is yours if you can find something better
The choice is yours
The choice is yours
Just like it seems you know it really don't matter

Don't be a fool and take too long
To make your move
A woman like me deserves a knight
In armor too
I've been a good woman to you
Give you sweet love every night
Break up, make up
That's all that we do
So if you better want me love
You've got to go down

The choice is yours
The choice is yours
The choice is yours if you can find something better
The choice is yours
The choice is yours
Just like it seems you know it really don't matter

I never give in to friends
That don't give in to me
Treat me with love
Desire to be with only me

The choice is yours
The choice is yours
The choice is yours if you can find something better
The choice is yours
The choice is yours
Just like it seems you know it really don't matter
