Now that you suffer from our disease
Will you understand me
Affravate the tension
Get the beat to feel the heat

Night after night I don't stop till dawn
Night after night I can do no wrong
Night after night I fill it to the top
Night after night and never spill a drop
Day after day I take it to extremes
Day adter day mutilate my dreams
Time after time I play it one two three
Time after time mirror turned on me

You pay the price, I'll never know
