Oh, oh oh oh

yeah ay ay ay

There's someone on my mind tonight
I don't know where he's coming from
I hope I'm not just making this up

(Huh)

I've got good intuition
Not one for superstition but when
It comes to loving somebody
I'll believe most anything
'Cause I long for my heart to share a love everlasting

I wanna love somebody
I wanna love somebody
Someone to climb to heaven with me

Oh ho, oh, oh

I wanna love somebody
Yes I'm gonna love somebody
Someone who wants to love only me
Oh ho, oh, oh

I'm walking on a thin line
I'm trying to believe that in time
Someone will dream about me all night

They say you just gotta wait
That love come with fate
But I know that there's a star made for everyone
And it's watching over me
If I could only see him, have him, hold him, know him

I wanna love somebody
I wanna love somebody
Someone to climb to heaven with me

Oh,

I wanna love somebody
Yes I wanna love somebody
Someone who wants to love only me

(Loves only me)

Oh,

I wanna know his name
I wanna feel his pain
Cause once I love him it will be forever
And that's the way it could be
And that's the way it should be

Oh,

I wanna love somebody (I wanna love somebody)
I wanna love somebody (oh oh)
Someone to climb to heaven with me

Love only me

I wanna love somebody (I wanna love somebody)
I wanna love somebody 

(Oh oh oh)

To heaven with me

Love only me

I wanna love somebody (I wanna love somebody)
I wanna love somebody 
'Till the end of time
