Ever so lonely
Ever so lonely without you
Ever so lonely 

Sink into your eyes and all I see
Love is an ocean
And you for me 

Sink into your eyes
Your eyes
Are all I see
Your love is an ocean 

An ocean refuses no river
Ever so lonely
An ocean refuses no river

Waiting for the time when we can be alone together 
Alone together
Eternally 

The ocean, the ocean 
Refuses no river 

The ocean, your ocean
Refuses no river 

Ever so lonely
Ever so lonely without you 

Your ocean
Your ocean
Refuses no river
