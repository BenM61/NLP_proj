Feeling like a boss, and
Staring at the stars, it
Doesn't matter the cost, 'cause
Everybody wants to be famous
I'm calling the shots, so
See you over at Mars, it
Doesn't matter the cost, seems like
Everybody wants to be

I think it could be me
The world's too small for me
My face up in your face
My face on every screen

Feeling like a boss, and
Staring at the stars, it
Doesn't matter the cost, 'cause
Everybody wants to be famous
I'm calling the shots, so
See you over at Mars, it
Doesn't matter the cost, seems like
Everybody wants to be

I think that you and I
Could set the world alight
'Cause we're all stars tonight
Just need to figure out why
