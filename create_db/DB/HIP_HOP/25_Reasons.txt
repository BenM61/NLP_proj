1... your smile, don't have to say no more
2... your guidance and all the things you show me
3... the way you look at me when you say, "I love you"
4... your headstrong personality
5... your take-charge capability
6... I love the way you cook for me beef roast, white rice, with gravy

I'll give you 25 reasons why I'm really in love with you,(ooh...)
I can give you 25 reasons why I'm never leaving you

7, 8, 9... the roses, the massages, the cards you give for no reason at all
10... the way you spend on me, even though I got my own money
11... for always being yourself, regardless of how I or anyone else felt
12... the way you don't trip on me, when I'm in the studio real late like right now

25 reasons why I'm really in love with you,(I got) 25 reasons why I'm....
Wait a minute... I don't need no backgrounds to tell you the rest, baby

13... knowing just what I need even when I didn't make it clear for you to see
14... for being understanding when the time comes, you know what I mean
15... for your beauty, inside and out  and to close it out, 16-25 is for
All the chicks you could've hit, but you didn't because of your love for me

I could give you 25 reasons why I'm really in love with you(ooh)
I can give you 25 reasons why I'm never leaving you
I could give you 25 reasons why I'm really in love with you(oh)
I can give you 25 reasons why I'm never leaving you...(oh)

I had to catch my breath for a minute
'Cause so many emotions are coming out in this song, (,oh,ooh)...
Have you ever loved somebody?....(oh,ooh)  Have you ever loved somebody?
Come on ladies, help me sang...

I can give you 25 reasons why I'm really in love with you (I am so in love with you)
25 reasons why I'm never leaving you (oh oo oo oo)
25 reasons why I'm really in love with you (I'm so in love with you
and it's really more than 25 reasons) 25 reasons why I'm never leaving you

25 reasons why I'm really in love with you(whoa, oo oh oo)..(oh oo oh oh)
25 reasons why I'm never leaving you (I'm never leaving you...)
