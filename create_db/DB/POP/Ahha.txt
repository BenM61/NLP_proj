Ah ha, ha-ah-ah

Left you, falling on the floor
Headed for the door
Went straight to Philidelphia
Oh no, what have I begun?
Called my mother, said I love her
Had another and another one
Questions, questions, suddenly suggestions
Where was anyone at the start of this thing?
Hold that gold up over your shoulder
All I needs a place to grieve

Oh, it’s for the best you didn’t listen
It’s for the best we get our distance (oh oh woah oh)
It’s for the best you didn’t listen
It’s for the best we get our distance

Oh lord, I feel alive
I've gone and saved my soul
If all that you read is everything you believe
Then let go, then let go, then let go

Now I’m over my head
Acting like I never started over again
I am the city I’m from
Always wanting more than just a word on my arm
Oh, I know, I can’t believe
That I'd let it get to me
Good to know I won’t become
Everything I’m afraid of

Oh, it’s for the best you didn’t listen
It’s for the best we get our distance (oh oh woah oh)
It’s for the best you didn’t listen
It’s for the best we get our distance

Oh lord, I feel alive
I've gone and saved my soul
If all that you read is everything you believe
Then let go, then let go, then let go

Mama don’t cry
I was once your little baby boy
So full of love and light
By the time I turned 25
I was lost among the pavement
Lower than the basement
And I couldn’t stand to smile
I thought of taking my own life
But mama don’t cry
I found songs among the tragic
Hung my hat on sadness
Mom, I think they’re trying to keep the grand romantic in me
Now that we got bottom lines
But mom, I think I’m ready to free this grand romantic in me
La -Di Da, La Di Da, La Di Da

Look out, look out!
Ah ha, ha-ah-ah, Ah ha, ha-ah-ah
Ah ha, ha-ah-ah, Ah ha, ha-ah-ah
Ah ha, ha-ah-ah…

Oh lord, I feel alive
I've gone and saved my soul
If all that you read is everything you believe
Then let go, then let go, then let go

Oh lord, I feel alive
I've gone and saved my soul
If all that you read is everything you believe
Then let go, then let go, then let go

Ah Ha
