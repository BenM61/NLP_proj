Fall in love, fall in love, says my heart
It's romance, take a chance, says my heart
But each time that I'm almost in your arms
This old school teacher brain of mine
Keeps ringing in false alarms

Then my head rules instead and I'm wise
To the scheme of that gleam in your eyes
So I kiss and run but the moment we're apart
Oh, you fool, that was love, says my heart

Says my heart, it says for me to fall in love, my heart
It also says for me to take a chance, take a chance
Oh my heart, it speaks to the rhythm of the beat
Don't be a fool, it says to me

Each time I'm in your arms
This heart of mine rings false alarms

Fall in love, fall in love, says my heart
Honey, it's romance, take a chance, says my heart
But each time that I'm almost in your arms
This old school teacher brain of mine
Keeps ringing in false alarms

Then my head rules me instead
So I kiss and then I run away
I'll come back some other day
Oh, you fool, that was love, says my heart

Now that I am in love, I know you love me
That I should have my heart to answer for me
And it will say to me to fall, to fall in love with you
Don't be a fool, says my heart
