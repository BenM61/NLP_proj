My love is like a cannonball;
I'm takin' aim and you're gonna fall.
Don't hide or try to get away;
You know the rules, and you're gonna play.
And we go one, two, three, four;
When midnight comes I'll be at your door.
Five, six, seven, eight;
Oh, oh, I just can't wait.
I'm gonna bang, bang you.
I'll shoot you down with my love gun, baby.
Bang, bang you.
I got you in the heart.
You're gonna be mine, yeah.
Hands up; reach for the sky.
I'll treat you good 'cause I'm a bad guy.
If love's a crime I've got a hundred schemes.
I'll be the villain in your book of dreams.
And we go one, two, three, four;
When midnight comes I'll be at your door.
Five, six, seven, eight;
Oh, oh, I just can't wait.
I'm gonna bang, bang you.
I'll shoot you down with my love gun, baby.
Bang, bang you.
I got you in the heart.
You're gonna be mine, yeah.
(You know what I'm talking about.
 Ooh, come on!) 
(Listen)
And we go one, two, three, four;

Five, six, seven, eight;
Oh, oh, I just can't wait.
I'm gonna bang, bang you.
I'll shoot you down with my love gun, baby.
Bang, bang you.
I got you in the heart.
You're gonna be mine, yeah.
Bang, bang you.
I'll shoot you down with my love gun, baby.
Bang, bang you.
I got you in the heart.
You're gonna be mine, yeah
