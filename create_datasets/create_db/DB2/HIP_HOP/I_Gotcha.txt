Don't worry 'bout a thing
My love is on the way
Don't worry 'bout a thing
'Cause i gotcha babe

Girl you know that i am someone you can count on
When things get rough, when things get tough
I'll be there when no one else is around
So don't ever let me down
And i don't want to see you frown

Don't worry 'bout a thing
My love is on the way
Don't worry 'bout a thing
'Cause i gotcha babe

Always i'll be with you
Through the thick and thin
And all the other things you feel within
Always i will try
So now i think it's time
And now i'm gonna make you mine

Girl you know that i am someone you can count on
When things get rough, when things get down
I don't want to fuss and fight
I just want to make it right
Loving you is all i want to do baby

Don't worry 'bout a thing
My love is on the way
Don't worry 'bout a thing
