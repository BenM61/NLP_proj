I know Kyoto well as a foreigner can
No gaijin really knows japan
We can walk the streets
Take in the view
The Kamogawa flows true
I'd love to show it to you

When the night comes
I'm going to stand there
In the moonlight with you
We're going to sleep
Under the dark sky too
Stars a rising
When the night comes

The streets of Paris 
They've got something
I love the atmosphere
In spring
Soul kissing by the stony
Banks of the Seine
Left Bank and perfect rain
I want to go there again

When the night comes
I'm going to stand there 
In the moonlight with you
We're going to sleep 
Under the dark sky too
Stars a rising
When the night comes

Everybody knows 
It's better in the midnight hour
Wilson Pickett says it's better
In the midnight hour

When the night comes
I'm going to stand there 
In the moonlight with you
We're going to sleep 
Under the dark sky too
Stars a rising
When the night comes
