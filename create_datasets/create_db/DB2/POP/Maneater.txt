Everybody look at me
I walk in the door you start screaming
C'mon everybody what you here for
Move your body around like a nymph-o
Everybody get your neck to crack around
All you crazy people c'mon jump around
I wanna see you all on your knees, knees 
You either wanna be with me or be me

Man-eater
Make you work hard, make you spend hard, make you want all of her love 
She's a man-eater 
Make you buy cars make you cut cards 
Make you fall real hard in love 
She's a man-eater 
Make you work hard make you spend hard, make you want all of her love 
She's a man-eater 
Make you buy cars make you cut cards 
Wish you never ever met her at all

And when she walks she walks with passion 
When she talks she talks like she can handle it 
When she asks for something boy she means it 
Even if you never ever see it 
Everybody get your neck to crack around 
All you crazy people c'mon jump around 
You doing anything to keep her by your side 
Because she says she love you love you long time (c'mon!)

You wish you never ever met her at all...
Been around the world I ain't ever seen a girl like this 
She's a man-eater, a man-eater.
