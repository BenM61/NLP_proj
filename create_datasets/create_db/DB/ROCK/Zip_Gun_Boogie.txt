Whatever happened to the Teenage Dream 

Surprise surprise, the boys are home 
My guardian angel's rung down my telephone 
The heat's on mister, can't you hear them scream 
Whatever happened to the Teenage Dream 

The curfew comes at the crack of light 
The sad old wino aches to dissipate the fright 
The jet junk jiver speeds past in his machine 
Whatever happened to the Teenage Dream 

A broken god from a musty world 
Sweetly mouthed touched an onyx girl 
His prison bars were very hard to clean 
Whatever happened to the Teenage Dream -Yeah 

The Wizard of Oz and the bronzen thief 
Ruled my girl with teutonic teeth 
But all was lost when her mouth turned green 
Whatever happened to the Teenage Dream 

Silver Surfer and the Ragged Kid 
Are all sad and rusted boy, they don't have a gig 
Believe me Pope Paul my toes are clean 
Whatever happened to the Teenage Dream 

Black is black and white is white 
Some go to Heaven and some get it light 
Nobody disapproves but his wicked screams 
Whatever happened to the Teenage Dream -Yeah
