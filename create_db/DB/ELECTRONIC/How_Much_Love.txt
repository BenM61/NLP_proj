How much love
How much love
I can't explain the life
Finally
We're out of the rain
The sea - it became
Will wash away
I want to see them fall
Stoned and beautiful
No look of love
Find in me a thing of wonder
Forever asking
How much love
How much love
How much love (How much love in a world of wonder)
How much love (How much love in a world of change)
Many reasons why
Finally
I wanted to say
I wanted to stay
A castaway
Find in me a thing of wonder
Forever asking
How much love
How much love
How much love (How much love in a world of wonder)
How much love from heaven above
From the stars in our eyes to the ocean tide
I can't explain the lie
Finally
I want to believe
The love that I need
Will come my way
Find in me a thing of wonder
Forever asking
How much love
How much love
How much love (How much love in a world of wonder)
How much love (How much love in a world of change)
