Don't know how to take it, don't know where to go
My resistance's running low
And everyday the hold is getting tighter and it troubles me so
You know that I'm nobody's fool

I'm nobody's fool and yet it's clear to me
I don't have a strategy
It's just like taking candy from a baby
And I think I must be

Under attack, I'm being taken
About to crack, defenses breaking
Won't somebody see and save a heart?
Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart

Under attack, I'm taking cover
He saw my track, my chasing lover
Thinking nothing's gonna stop him now
Should I want to, I'm not sure, I won't know how

Now this is getting crazy, I should tell him so
Really let my anger show
'Cause waiting at the answer to his questions is a definite blow
I'm kind of certain that's the truth

Guess I'm kind of flattered but I'm scared as well
Something like a magic spell
I hardly dare to think of what could happen
Where I'd be if I fell

Under attack, I'm being taken
About to crack, defenses breaking
Won't somebody see and save a heart?
Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart

Under attack, I'm taking cover
He saw my track, my chasing lover
Thinking nothing's gonna stop him now
Should I want to, I'm not sure, I won't know how

Under attack, I'm being taken
About to crack, defenses breaking
Won't somebody see and save a heart?
Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart

About to crack, defenses breaking

Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart
