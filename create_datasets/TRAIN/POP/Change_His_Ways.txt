Deep in the jungle, he lost her favor
Another gambit, he would have made her
He gave her perfume, she used his razor
And decided to change his ways

She was a gambler, he didn't blame her
She had a dimple in her favor
At the last minute, he always chased her
And decided to change his ways

Life would be so much more exciting
If we could live it day to day
We could at least adjust the lighting
To illuminate the way

He took the loving that she'd been craving
She took advantage of the saving;
It almost ruin her reputation
And decided to change his ways

She wasn't crazy 'bout his behavior
She read it somewhere in the paper
He was seducing a ballerina
And decided to change his ways
