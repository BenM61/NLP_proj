Say hey Johnny boy, the battle call.
United we stand, divided we fall.
Together we are what we can't be alone, 
We came to this country, you made it our home. 

This man so humble, this man so brave.
A legend to many, he fought to his grave.
Saved family and friends from the hardship and horror, 
in a land of depression he gave hope for tomorrow. 

Say Johnny me boy, this ones for you.
With the strength of many and the courage of few. 
To what do we owe this man who's fight 
was for the masses, he gave his life. 

Say hey Johnny boy, the battle call 
United we stand, divided we fall. 
Together we are what we can't be alone, 
We came to this country, you made it our home. 

A friend to the locals who dabbled in crime. 
He'd give you a job and he'd give you his time. 
He wasn't a crook, but he couldn't be conned. 
John knew the difference between right and wrong. 

Say Johnny me boy, you live no longer, 
Others forgotten, your memory's stronger. 
Lets drink to the causes in your life: 
Your family, your friends, the union, your wife. 

Say hey Johnny boy, the battle call. 
United we stand, divided we fall. 
Together we are what we can't be alone.
We came to this country, you made it our home. 

Say hey Johnny boy, the battle call. 
United we stand, divided we fall. 
Together we are what we can't be alone.
We came to this country, you made it our home. 

And the boys on the docks needed John for sure. 
When they came to this country he opened the door. 
He said "Man I'll tell ya, they don't like our kind. 
Though it starts with a fist it must end with your mind." 

Say hey Johnny boy, the battle call. 
United we stand, divided we fall. 
Together we are what we can't be alone.
We came to this country you made it our home.
