Take a good look
In your own time
See the world laugh
Through a child's eyes
Sunshine
Shine until you're mine
It's just a magic hour
Just a magic hour
Such a magic hour
Now I know we can drift away now
If only we find a way how
Now I know we can drift away now, how
If only to find a way out,how
Take a good look
In your own time
See the world turn
Through your own eyes
Sunshine
Shine until you're mine
It's just a magic hour
Such a magic hour
Such a magic hour
Now I know we can drift away now
If only we find a way how
Now I know we can drift away now
If only we find a way out
Now I know we can drift away now, how
If only we find a way how
I know we can drift away now, how
We've only to find a way out
Well I know we can drift away now
If only we find our way how
Now I know we can drift away now 
If only we find a way out
Out, out, out, out
