Loretta broke my heart in a letter
Told me she was leaving and her life would be better
Joan broke it off over the phone
After the tone she left me alone
Jen said she'd never ever see me again
When I saw her again, she said it again

Jan met another man
Liza got amnesia, just forgot who I am
Felicity said there was no electricity
Emily, no chemistry

Fran, ran, Bruce turned out to be a man
Flo had to go, I couldn't go with the flow
Carol Brown just took the bus out of town
But I'm hoping that you'll stick around

He doesn't cook or clean
He's not good boyfriend material
Ooh, we can eat cereal
You'll lose interest fast,, his relationships never last
Shut up girlfriends from the past
He says he'll do one thing and then he goes and does another thing
Ooh

Who organized all my ex-girlfriends into a choir
And got them to sing?
Ooh ooh ooh, shut up
Shut up girlfriends from the past

Mimi will no longer see me
Brittany, Brittany hit me
Paula, Persephone, Stella, and Stephanie
There must be fifty ways that lovers have left me

Carol Brown just took the bus out of town
Love is a delicate thing, you can't just throw it away on the breeze
He said the same thing to me
How can we ever know if I'm the right person in this world
That means he looks at other girls
Love is a mystery, it does not follow rules
This guy is a fool

He'll always be a boy, hes a man who never grew up
I thought I told you to shut up
Mona, you told me you were in a coma
Tiffany, you said that you had an epiphany
Mm

Would you like a little cereal?
Who organized this choir of ex-girlfriends?
Was it you Carol Brown?
Was it you Carol Brown?
Carol Brown just took the bus out of town
But I'm hoping that you'll stick around
Stick around
Stick around
Stick around
Stick around
