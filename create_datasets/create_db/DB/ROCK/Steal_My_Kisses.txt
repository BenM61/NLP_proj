I pulled into Nashville, Tennessee, 
But you wouldn't even come around to see me 
And since you're headin' up to Carolina, 
You know I'm gonna be right there behind ya 

'Cause I always have to steal my kisses from you 
Always have to steal my kisses from you
Always have to steal my kisses from you
I always have to steal my kisses from you

Now I love to feel that warm southern rain, 
Just to hear it fall is the sweetest sounding thing 
And to see it fall on your simple country dress 
It's like heaven to me I must confess 

'Cause I always have to steal my kisses from you 
I always have to steal my kisses from you
Always have to steal my kisses from you
I always have to steal my kisses from you

Now I've been hangin' 'round you for days, 
But when I lean in you just turn your head away 
Oh no, you didn't mean that 
She said I love the way you think, but I hate the way you act 

'Cause I always have to steal my kisses from you 
Always have to steal my kisses from you
Always have to steal my kisses from you
I always have to steal my kisses from you

Always have to steal my kisses from you
I always have to steal my kisses from you
Always have to steal my kisses from you
Always have to steal my kisses from you
