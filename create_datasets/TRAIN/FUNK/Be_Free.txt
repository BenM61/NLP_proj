Tonight

Now, this little girl was born to dance my good side
My bad side was worrying me
You see the man I love ain't nowhere to be found
I'm staring at the phone but it won't make a sound 
These four walls are getting me down I gotta get on a merry-go-round

What you gonna do, I made up my mind

Tonight I'll be free I'm gonna dance like 
I belong to me tonight I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance tonight I'm gonna dance like I belong to me

I'm tryna keep it together it's bout to get me down oh
What you want from a lady I don't understand 
You're always peeking at the ladies with the 
Short dresses on you only want me in mine when 
We're alone I'm going out tonight I'm in a real 
Good mood I need a change of space and a fresh 
Attitude I'm tired now I can't take it nomore

What you gonna do, what you gonna do I made up my mind

Tonight I'll be free I'm gonna dance like 
I belong to me tonight I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance tonight I'm gonna dance like I belong to me

Tonight

I'm gonna be free, I'm gonna be free
