Softly, gently, I will let you down
'Cause I don't love you in the same way now
I can hold you but not with lover's arms
'Cause you are more of a brother to me now
And I can lie next to you, but I can't lie to you

So walk into the sun and watch me
Run into the rain
For you the future's easy
So don't weep, for me it's getting
Steep

I loved you for exactly who you are
And I'd say you've come the nearest yet by far
And I can lie next tou you, but I can't lie to you

So walk into the sun and watch me
Run into the rain
For you the future's easy, so don't weep, for me it's getting

Steeper and in the dark that's where I want to be
Deeper, I'm going somewhere you won't want to see

So walk into the sun and watch me
Run into the rain
For you the future's easy, so don't weep
Yes I will watch you
Walk into the sun and watch me
Run into the rain drops
For you the future's easy, so don't weep
For me it's getting
Steep
