Yeah!
Get 'em Buck!

Okay! I'm reloaded, my bankroll swole, and a nigga can't fold it
I got 'em like hey! Got 'em rollin'
The kush on the way, and the champagne frozen
Watch me do my thang; I got these hos open
I'm ridin' presidential like the shit that I'm smokin'
Water wit' the work, Patron on my shirt
And a zip ain't shit; I need a quarter p of Purp
Gon' break it down, pass it all around
I can serve Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown
Them dope boys in this bitch, like let me buy that
Broke niggas in this bitch, like let me try that
I need a beat in the bitch; let me call Polow
Mr. Tennakey, I still get 'em for the low though
Shawty, light up the dro; I ain't ready to go
Can't ban me from the radio or f*ck up my show, you know

Haters tryin' to ban a nigga mayne (It's okay!)
I bounce back; watch me do my thang (It's okay!)
I got my Chevy hoggin' up the lane (It's okay!)
I'm a boss; I can make it rain (It's okay!)
Now get buck, bitch (Watch me do the damn thang)
Get buck, bitch (Watch me do the damn thang)
Get buck, bitch (Watch me do the damn thang)
Get buck, bitch (Watch me do the damn thang)
Get buck, bitch (Watch me do the damn thang)
Get buck, bitch (Watch me do the damn thang)
Get buck, bitch (Watch me do the damn thang)
Get buck, bitch (Watch me do the damn thang)

Let's play the game; I'm the quarterback; don't stop, homey
I go to jail if I get sacked, so block for me
Eight ball in my corner pocket; it's on and poppin'
Got the whole club leanin' wit' it, and body rockin'
Drunk drivin' in my Cut, dawg; I got my truck parked
Seventy Two Tennessee Titan, like what up y'all?
I'm home, boy, holla at ya homeboy
Better come quick; once I get it then it's gone, boy
First come, first serve; f*ck what ya heard
I'm piecin' out my pack till I come up on a bird
Blow the smoke out my nose, pimpin' on these hos
They know me at the bank, love me at the jewelry stores
I play it how it goes; the butterfly doors
On them old school vogues with the chrome on the toes
These f*ck niggas know that I will let it go
(I bet he got a vest) no, but I got my tech though

Haters tryin' to ban a nigga mayne (It's okay!)
I bounce back; watch me do my thang (It's okay!)
I got my Chevy hoggin' up the lane (It's okay!)
I'm a boss; I can make it rain (It's okay!)
Now get buck, bitch (Watch me do the damn thang)
Get buck, bitch (Watch me do the damn thang)
Get buck, bitch (Watch me do the damn thang)
Get buck, bitch (Watch me do the damn thang)
Get buck, bitch (Watch me do the damn thang)
Get buck, bitch (Watch me do the damn thang)
Get buck, bitch (Watch me do the damn thang)
Get buck, bitch (Watch me do the damn thang)

Yeah, you know what it is
How we do the damn thang down here
Nigga, what you workin' with?
Yeah, hey, my nigga
Now don't be in the club throwin' ya rent money
Be broke in the mornin'
Have us laughin' at ya broke ass
Yeah, where my dope boys at?
Yeah, shawty, I see you!
Now pick up that god damn money!
Hey! Let's go!
