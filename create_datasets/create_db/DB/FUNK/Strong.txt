Lost is the word for me
Chaos is all that I see
Fear caresses and plays in my hair
I don't want to go there
I like it here
My life is beating me up
And if I don't die I guess I'll go on
I guess I'll be
I guess I'll be
Reason I think leads me along
And the path that I've chosen
Isn't clear and it's long
In darkness with my eyes closed
I wander
I wonder will I ever get home to her
My life is beating me up
And if I don't die I guess I'll go on
I guess I'll be
STRONG
STRONG
Believe in a way I have to take
To face my fear
Tonight fall
And I won't go down
Purpose what is my purpose
Well Well
And I won't begin to fail
To find what's going on
My life is beating me up
And if I don't die I guess I'll go on
I guess I'll be
STRONG
STRONG
