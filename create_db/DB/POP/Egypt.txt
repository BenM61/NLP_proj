Egypt, I saw you 
On the television
I saw your name 
Written on a wall
I saw your picture
In a magazine

Egypt, can I ask you 
To lend me your blue sky
And your dreamy
Virginal tenderness

I don't know you very well
But I really like you

Egypt, I'm a gonna 
A, see you soon
Said I'm a gonna walk on 
Your foreshore

Egypt, won't you hold me
Like I held a map of you
I learned your location 
From a travel brochure
Egypt, I need your 
Sophisticated silence

Egypt I'm a gonna
See you soon
I'm a gonna walk on 
Your foreshore
