Tell it to your sister
And tell it to your brother
Just how much you miss them
Why you don't even brother

Could this be the same love
We share with one another
Always been a cut above
You know that it's gonna be alright

Tell me what's in your mind
I know that you're trying to
Help me, but I just can't find
A way to get out of this love

Can't you see. That it feels so unreal 
Tell it to your sister
And tell it to your brother
Just how much you miss them

Why you don't even brother
Could this be the same love
We share with one another
Always been a cut above

You know that it's gonna be alright
Help me, cause I'm going down
And now that I've got a good
Reason, I'm taking the easy way out

I'll never get out of this love
Can't you see, it's got to be so unreal 
Love, can't you see, that it feels so unreal 
Tell it to your sister

And tell it to your brother
Just how much you miss them
Why you don't even brother
Could this be the same love

We share with one another
Always been a cut above
You know that it's gonna be alright
