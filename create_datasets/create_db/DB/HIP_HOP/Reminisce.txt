I can remember when
We had
We had it all (Reminisce on the love we had)
You and I
You and I (Reminisce on the love we had)

You know
You know we had it all
You and I (Reminisce on the love we had)

Let's make the time tonight
While the feelings right
Reminisce on the love we had
Let's make the time tonight
While the feelings right
Reminisce on the love we had

I know that we've been here before
The candle light and you walking softly through my door
Come on in my suite
How have you been?
Your so nice but tonight
We're gonna be more than just friends
I recall the days and ways of love we made
I still feel the heat when we shared each other
Don't you feel the magic
The mystery's in the air
Lets go down to lover's lane
With the love we shared

Let's make the time tonight
While the feelings right
Reminisce on the love we had
Let's make the time tonight
While the feelings right
Reminisce on the love we had

I can see you standing there alone
Like an angel
Tryin' to find his way home
I don't remember how we fell apart
Here we are again, come on
Right into my heart
I recall the days in ways of love we made
I still feel the heat when we shared each other
Don't you feel the magic
The mystery's in the air
Let's go down to lover's lane
With the love we shared

Let's make the time tonight
While the feelings right
Reminisce on the love we had
Let's make the time tonight
While the feelings right
Reminisce on the love we had

Make the time tonight
The feeling's oh so right
Reminisce on the love we had
Make the time tonight
Make the time tonight
The feeling's oh so right
Reminisce on the love we had
Make the time tonight

Let's make the time tonight
Feelin' is oh so right
Reminisce on the love we had
Make the time tonight
Let's make the time tonight
Feelin' is oh so right
Reminisce on the love we had
Make the time tonight

Baby
Reminisce
I know we been here before
Some candle light and you walking softly through my door
Come on in my suite
Tonight we're gonna be more than friends
Feelings right my, my
Sweet baby, baby, baby
I can see you standing there like an angel
Oh boy, oh reminisce
Reminisce on the love we had
