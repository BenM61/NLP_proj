Who are you that taunts my nights
With darkness and reproach
Are you she
Embracing devils never to awake

Pretty pretty black dream
Give me infinity's kiss
Pretty pretty pretty black one
Your lips I hunger for
'Cause I want it
And I need it
Your tongue I hunger for
Want it
And I need it
Black dream can kiss me loose
Oh

Your existence is only that which
Causes inner pain
Cradle lifeless bodies
In the bosom of your hell

Pretty pretty black dream
Give me infinity's kiss
Pretty pretty pretty black one
Your lips I hunger for
'Cause I want it
And I need it
Your tongue I hunger for
Want it
And I need it
Black dream can kiss me loose

Whoa go go oh

Black dream, black dream, black dream
Black dream, black dream, black dream
Black dream

When you come I'll be waiting here
