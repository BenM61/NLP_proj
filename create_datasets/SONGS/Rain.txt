You'd never give up
I can't believe anything you say
And it must be my luck
'Cause no one else gets treated this way

And I wanna know
What goes on in that head of yours
Yeah I wanna know
'Cause I don't think I can take much more

Rain
You must be sick or something
I can't take another day
Rain
is falling down
but will the sun come out again

I never speak up
I just tried to stay out of the way
And I must have messed up
'cause that's all that I hear you say

And I wanna know
What on earth makes you act like this
Yeah I wanna know
'Cause I don't think I can take this shit

Rain
You must be sick or something
I can't take another day
Rain
is falling down
but will the sun come out again

sun come out
sun come out

Rain
You must be sick or something
I can't take another day
Rain
is falling down
but will the sun come out again

Rain
You must be sick or something
Rain
rain, rain, rain

is falling down
but will the sun come out again
