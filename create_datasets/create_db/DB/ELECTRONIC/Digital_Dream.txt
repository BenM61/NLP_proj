Put some soul in my machine
Put some soul in my machine
Machines do not dream
Feed your dreams in my machine
Feed your dreams in my machine
Dirty and obscene

Unwrap all your beauty and love
Unwrap all your beauty and love

Put some life in my machine
Put some life in my machine
Machines do not feel
Fill the world in my machine
Fill the world in my machine
Tried to keep it clean
