Oh no, who's got you all dressed up in those clothes?
Said I don't know
but you're gonna need some help out of those

Oh you're alright, you're alright, you're alright
But you smell like your mama is smoke
So tell her, tell her
You tell her I said hello

Oh we could do it any way you want
We only like you cause you're cute and young
You gotta work what daddy gave you, son
Go on and show me that you know how to use it
And do your duty

And get on the floor
Don't make a fuss just do it
Look out I'm fixing to thrill
We know you're one of us
What's all the fuss? just do it
Uh huh I'm fixin' to thrill

Yeah the girls
The girls they're looking round
for trouble all sorts
And the boys
they offer diamonds but
They're giving them quartz

That's alright, it's alright, it's alright
We'll get you something
That you can't get at home
And your mama, your mama
She don't know what she don't know

So we could do it any way you want
We only like you 'cause you're cute and young
You gotta work what daddy gave you, son
Come on and show me that you know how to use it
And do your duty

And get on the floor
Don't make a fuss, just do it
Uh huh I'm fixing to thrill
We know you're one of us
What's all the fuss? Just do it
Look out I'm fixin' to thrill

Yeah do it, I'm fixin' to thrill

And get on the floor
Don't make a fuss, just do it
Look out I'm fixing to thrill
We know you're one of us
What's all the fuss? Just do it
Look out I'm fixin' to thrill

And get on the floor
Don't make a fuss, just do it
Look out I'm fixing to thrill
We know you're one of us
What's all the fuss? Just do it
Look out I'm fixin' to thrill
