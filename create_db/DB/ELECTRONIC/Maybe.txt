When it thunders outside my window
I shudder to think you heard it too
Your days are long I'm sure
But my days they're very blue
Lately things have been changing
Not in your eyes but mine
I've been starting to realize something
I may have known all the time
I THINK I MAY LIKE YOU
MAYBE MAYBE NOT
SOMETHINGS definitely CHANGED
WHILE WE WERE APART
Sometimes I think the most of you
But sometimes I think the worst
Maybe I'm using you to flirt
I just want to unfold
To let the truth be known
To me and everyone else
You may say I'm fickle
But I'm a woman - I need to change my mind (chorus 2x)
