I went to make the vivisection
Saw the star carved on her chest
Goat of lust, attacking heaven
Points to the gaze of the blue eyed hexe

Blue eyed hexe
Blue eyed hexe
Hexe hexe
Blue eyed hexe

I tried to hide but I was not able
Shirt was opened down to her navel
Felt a burning in my solar plexus
Give me the pow-wow, give me the hexe

Blue eyed hexe
Blue eyed hexe
Hexe hexe
Blue eyed hexe

I called the Nixes from The Queets
Spirits take me through the straits
Closed my eyes to stop her vexing
Still the burning of the blue eyed hexe

Blue eyed hexe
Blue eyed hexe
Hexe hexe
Blue eyed hexe

Blue eyed hexe
Blue eyed hexe
Hexe hexe
Blue eyed hexe
