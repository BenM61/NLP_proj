Riding our bicycles down on the freeway
Leaving distorted cars trailing behind
We move like bullets, no danger, no danger
We take that for granted

Crossed the bridge, left the network behind
I could feel it in my heart
We gage ourselves and the scenery too
We push on forever and a day

This is the Ice Age

Feeling the trees and the wind on my face
Passing along single file
Might be autumn but we know it's not
Cynosures hiding in the air

All we did was close our eyes
A moment come unhinged
All we did was close our eyes
A world falling into shape

The wind purls over a hinterland of long grass
Gold, where tiny black horses play
Distant mountains move like water
My friend is with me, a familiar voice
An unfinished memory
This is the Age of Innocent Passion
