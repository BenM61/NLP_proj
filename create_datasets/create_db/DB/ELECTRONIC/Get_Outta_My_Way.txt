What's the worst thing that could happen to you?
Take the chance tonight and try something new
You're getting boring; you're oh-so boring
And I don't recognize the zombie you turn into

Don't worry 'cause tonight I got you
You can take a seat, do what you normally do
I'm about to let you see
This is what'll happen if you ain't givin' your girl what she needs

Leave you, move on to a perfect stranger
You talk, I walk, wanna feel the danger
See me with him and it's turning you on
It's got me saying
Getting me back at the end of this song

Get outta my way
Get outta my way
Got no more to say
He's taken your place
Get outta my way
Way outta my way
Got no more to say
He's taken your place
Get outta my way

Now I gotta taste; I wanna explore
Ain't going to waste, no, not anymore
You going hard now to win my heart, but
Too many times now you've been calling her

Don't worry 'cause tonight I got you
You can take a seat, do what you normally do
I'm about to let you see
This is what'll happen if you ain't givin' your girl what she needs

Leave you, move on to a perfect stranger
You talk, I walk, wanna feel the danger
See me with him and it's turning you on
It's got me saying
Getting me back at the end of this song

Get outta my way
Get outta my way
Got no more to say
He's taken your place
Get outta my way
Way outta my way
Got no more to say
He's taken your place
Get outta my way

And, no, I ain't goin' home 'cause I wanna stay
But I won't be alone, no how, no way
Now I've showed you what I'm made of
This is what'll happen if you ain't givin' your girl what she needs

Leave you, move on to a perfect stranger
You talk, I walk, wanna feel the danger
See me with him and it's turning you on
It's got me saying
Getting me back at the end of this song

Get outta my way
Get outta my way
Got no more to say
He's taken your place
Get outta my way
Way outta my way
Got no more to say
He's taken your place
Get outta my way

No, I ain't goin' home
But I won't be alone
Now I've showed you what I'm made of
Now I've showed you what I'm made of
