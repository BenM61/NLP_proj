Lay down 
Let's explore this tenderness between us 
There ain't no one around at all to see us 
And baby would you mind 
If maybe you and I 
Took a little time to find each other? 

Baby, we got all the time in the world 
So why don't we just take it nice and slow? 
We got everything we need 
To plant a lovin' seed 
And all the time we need to watch it grow 

Stay down 
Stay at least until the fire stops burnin' 
At least until the room has stopped its turnin' 
And when the embers dyin' low 
We're lyin' in the afterglow 
It'll be as sweet as anything we've ever known 

Baby, we got all the time in the world 
So why don't we just take it nice and slow? 
We got everything we need 
To plant a lovin' seed 
And all the time we need to watch it grow 

Baby, we got all the time in the world 
So why don't we just take it nice and slow? 
We got everything we need 
To plant a lovin' seed 
And all the time we need to watch it grow 

Baby, we got all the time in the world 
So why don't we just take it nice and slow?...
