Get your scaprbook out
Lay it on the bed
Fix the disapointment 
In your head

She's lying down there there on the floor
Not exactly what you waited for

There once was a woman who took you by the hand
And showed you you could be a man

But now there's nothing left to say
And I'd be grateful if you'd just go away.

In her jewerly box
She still keeps your high school ring
And I know you'll remember
Her last virgin spring.

BUt it just ain't happening any more.
Won't you save my life if you can.
Cause there's just no peace with Rollin' Mill Man.
Cause there's just no peace with Rollin' Mill Man.
