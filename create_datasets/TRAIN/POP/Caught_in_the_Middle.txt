You said that love was just a state of mind,
A puzzle made of pieces you can't find,
And for me you never really had the time, I was blind.
And everything that you meant to me,
Is written in the pages of my history,
But it's over now as far as I can see, suddenly

Things are so different now you're gone,
I thought it'd be easy I was wrong.
And now I'm caught, and now, I'm caught in the middle,
Even though I'm with someone new, all I can think about is you.
And now I'm caught, and now, I'm caught in the middle.

Moving on she brings me brighter days,
Thoughts of you are in my mind always,
Like a memory that I can't erase, it's here to stay.

Things are so different now you're gone,
I thought it'd be easy I was wrong.
And now I'm caught, and now, I'm caught in the middle,
Even though I'm with someone new, all I can think about is you.
And now I'm caught, and now, I'm caught in the middle.

So different (it's so different), so easy (so easy),
But I can't get over you (I can't get over you).
So different (it's so different), so easy (so easy),
But I can't get over you (and I can't get over you).

Things are so different now you're gone,

And now I'm caught, and now, I'm caught in the middle.
