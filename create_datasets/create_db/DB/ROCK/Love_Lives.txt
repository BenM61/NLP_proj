I look at you, you look at me, I knew it then but you
Couldn't see it, and now you've come around I wander
Way, you stay behind, but I got the memories to remind
Me, of how you used to, I wander way, you stay behind,
But I got the memories to remind me, of how you used
To, hold me so tight, be by my side, and make it
Alright

Love gives, and love takes, yeah it will keep you up in
The middle of night and catch you when you're falling
Love gives, what love makes, if you let it go it'll
Always come back, when it hears you calling, love lives

I know you're there you always were, there'll be an end
Of all this hurting, but how many tears will fall?
Before you're back into my arms so I can tell you I've
Been dying without you, too many nights are passing us
By but we'll make it by

Love gives, and love takes, yeah it will keep you up in
The middle of night and catch you when you're falling
Love gives, what love makes, if you let it go it'll
Always come back, when it hears you calling

Love lifts you up and lets you fly and makes you think
You'll never die, it's just like live in heaven and
You'll never ever wanna come down

'cause love is, what love makes, and true love never
Breaks

'cause love gives, and love takes, yeah it will keep
You up in the middle of night and catch you when you're
Falling love gives, what love makes, if we let it go
It'll always come back, when it hears you

Love gives, and love takes, yeah it will keep you up in
The middle of night and catch you when you're falling
Love gives, what love makes, yeah, if you let it go
It'll always come back, when it hears you calling, love
Lives

Love lives
