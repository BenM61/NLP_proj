I fell for the promises that you made 
Sugar coated compliments that you paid
But while you told me that you were working late
She got the nights on the town, the gifts, the dates
I was too busy dreaming while the red flags were screaming
Now I don’t need your streaming ,scheming, and all your excuses

(Yeah, yeah)You said it was an accident
(No no) You didn’t mean for it to happen
Sitting in traffic or your phone was dead, 
Over at your buddy’s or the lights were all red 
And oh yeah, you said she was just a friend
Yeah breaking my heart was no accident

No longer wondering where you are at
I don’t care anymore, so what you think about that
Now I see straight through your disguise
You’re gone and I’ve moved on with my life
I’m not too busy dreaming while the red flags were screaming
Now I don’t need your streaming ,scheming, and all your excuses

Yeah, yeah)You said it was an accident
(No,no) You didn’t mean for it to happen
Sitting in traffic or your phone was dead, 
Over at your buddy’s or the lights were all red 
And oh yeah, you said she was just a friend
Yeah breaking my heart was no accident

It won’t be long before she will realize
That being with you is just a waste of time
And as you look into her eyes and tell her your lies
I’ll be out on the town with my new guy
She’ll be at home dreaming while the red flags are screaming
And hearing your streaming, scheming and all your excuses

(Yeah, yeah) You said it was an accident
(No no) You didn’t mean for it to happen
Sitting in traffic or your phone was dead, 
Over at your buddy’s or the lights were all red 
And oh yeah, you said she was just a friend
Yeah breaking my heart was no accident
