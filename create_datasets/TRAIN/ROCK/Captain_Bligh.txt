I give you one good tiny reason I think you could believe it
I give you one good tiny reason I think you could see through it
I'm not the kind of man that thinks the choke could hurt me
I'm not the kind of man that thinks the choke can see me

And you know a little bit goes a long way
And you know a little bit lasts a long time
And the time has come
To undo the wrong I've done

I am a grieving man
I can't believe the things I've done for you
I am a guilty man
I can't believe the things I've done for you

I give you one good tiny reason to push that big suit too far
I give you one good tiny reason to smash him and his big car
Everybody thinks I'm blue
Everybody thinks it's true
And I just can't keep in side

So you think it's you
So you think it's true
And you know a little bit lasts a long time
And you know a little bit goes a long way
And the time has come
To undo the wrong I've done

I am a grieving man
I can't believe the things I've done for you
I am a beaten man
I can't believe the things I've done for you

I am a blessed man
I can't believe the things I've done for you
I am a guilty man
I can't believe the things I've done for you

I am a grieving man
I can't believe the things I've done for you
I am a beaten man
I can't believe the things I've done for you

I tried to break...
I tried to break...
I tried to break...
Yes I will give it a shot...
Yes I will give it a shot...
Yes I will give it a shot...
