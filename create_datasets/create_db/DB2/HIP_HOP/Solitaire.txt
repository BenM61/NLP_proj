Burr, I'm out pussy
It's your worst nightmare
Glacier, ha

I was just sittin' in a cell playin' solitaire
Now they see me everywhere, bracelet full of solitaires
Solitaire, solitaire, neck, ear, solitaire
Bad bitch from Fort Lauderdale, say she love them solitaires

4 mil for the crib, 1.5 just to keep me chill (1.5)
To my neighbors here, Jack and Jill, still trap up the hill (through the hill)
Fiji water, talkin' Aquafina glass, crystal clear
Ice there, ice here, I just iced the atmosphere

(Huncho) I'm walkin' real light (walk)
It's somethin' like skatin' on ice (skate)
Yo hoe wanna f*ck my vibe (sheesh)
Huncho Brett Favre, throw pies (Huncho)
Try the gang, and we dumpin' (dump)
Glacier Boy, it's a global warmin' (yeah)
Now everybody wanna come join in (gang)
Niggas born in, they ain't sworn in (no)

I was just sittin' in a cell playin' solitaire (huh)
Now they see me everywhere, bracelet full of solitaires (Wop)
Solitaire, solitaire, neck, ear, solitaire
Bad bitch from Fort Lauderdale, say she love them solitaires (mwah)

Bitch, I don't play no solitaire, I'm a fuckin' millionaire
Trap stars everywhere (trap), bad hoes everywhere (bad)
Right wrist quarter million dollars, that's no lie
Left wrist, all Piguets, I put it in the sky

All my stones single man, they ain't with the mingling
Damn, that's Mr. Whole Clip, but we ain't with that kinky shit
Wop be on that Nicki shit, my whole clique robbin'
Lookin' at the robbers like, "Y'all ain't finna take shit"
Glacier Boy, amazin' shit, your jeweler ain't up on this
Crazy diamond bracelet, I'm jealous of my own wrist
If you ain't spent a million yet, you probably won't agree with this
Major labels compete for us, we keep on coppin' pieces
(It's Gucci!)

I was just sittin' in a cell playin' solitaire
Now they see me everywhere, bracelet full of solitaires
Solitaire, solitaire, neck, ear, solitaire

Wop, ha, Eskimo, Migos, all I know
