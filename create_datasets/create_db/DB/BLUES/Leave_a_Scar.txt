The old man was a good man he raised his children right
He taught us how to work hard and showed us how to fight
Told me about the good Lord and when to use a gun
Made me very proud of where it is that I come from

When I die put my father in the big same urn
Look down at me smiling I don't want no beating tune
All I leave behind me is a rag of old guitars
I may not change the world but I'm gonna leave a scar

Years a row nobody ,the old man turned me loose
Way cross town I learned about those sad ol' country blues
Taught me how to prep my heart from trying to make it right
Told me not to ever break one alone at a time

When I die put my father in the big same urn
Look down at me smiling I don't want no beating tune
All I leave behind me is a rag of old guitars
I may not change the world but I'm gonna leave a scar

Hope you have me on your memory like a painted old tattoo
I might not make a history book but I'll burn a page or two
Yeah

When I die put my father in the big same urn
Look down at me smiling I don't want no beating tune
All I leave behind me is a rag of old guitars
I may not change the world but I'm gonna leave a scar
