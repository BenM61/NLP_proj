In the hardstone city where the dust gets in your eyes
Pa he's out drinking and there's children crying
Ma sits by the washing, she don't know what to do
Looks like this hardstone city's gonna get on top of you

They say in this hardstone city you gotta carry a gun
Well I ain't gonna carry no shooter for no one
Ain't gonna get me no body's gonna get me down

This hardstone city has me feeling low
All I hear is wildcats screaming on the radio
Gonna get my sister gonna hold her near
Gonna take her right, right out of here

I'm sick and tired of waking up in this town
All I hear is car horns hooting all day long
Gonna get me a lady, fall in love with her
And take her out of this crazy world
