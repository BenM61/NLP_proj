Baby it don't matter, anyone can see the signs, I caught you looking over, with just a little bit of a smile.
You tell him that you love him, while I'm running through your mind.
Cause I know that you know your cover will blow, it's only a matter of time, 
It's not my style to try and cheat and lie, why do you sanctify something that already died, I've got something that will bring you alive
 
Chorus
Are ya gunna shout from the rooftops honey, tell me I'm the only one, kick him to the curb and baby don't stop running, tell me are ya gunna come get some, did you ever ask yaself the question, where the hell did I go wrong? 'cause you know when its cool, ill be waiting for you, so tell me are ya gunna come, come, come get some.

All those words your wasting, trying to tell yaself ya need more time, but what's the point in faking, when ya know ya'll never make it right, 
Ya say your head is blurry, but I can't get you out of mine, I don't need to cause pressure, but I just can't let ya, go on while ya living this lie, 
It's not my style to let it pass me by, why do you sanctify something that already died, I've got something that will bring you alive
 
Chorus
Are ya gunna shout from the rooftops honey, tell me I'm the only one, kick him to the curb and baby don't stop running, tell me are ya gunna come get some, did you ever ask yaself the question, where the hell did I go wrong? 'cause you know when its cool, ill be waiting for you, so tell me are ya gunna come, come, come get some.

(Crushed out and waiting)
(Black tiled and fading)
(Freaked out and shaking)
Just breaking for you (breaking for you)

I can't go on like this forever!!

Chorus
Are ya gunna shout from the rooftops honey, tell me I'm the only one, kick him to the curb and baby don't stop running, tell me are ya gunna come get some, did you ever ask yaself the question, where the hell did I go wrong? 'cause you know when its cool, ill be waiting for you, so tell me are ya gunna come, come, come get some.
