So long you did me wrong
So long you did me wrong

Baby, what you're doing now you're pissin' me off
Uh but your hair is so luxurious and your lips are so soft uh
Anyway you slice it uh, you're doing me wrong
But I love the way you walk now and your legs are so long

Well your looks had me putty in your hand now
But I took just as much as I can stand now

And you can walk your long legs baby out of my life
So long you did me wrong
Yeah you can walk your long legs baby right out of my life
So long you did me wrong

From the moment that I met you I thought you were fine, so fine
But your shitty fuckin' attitude has got me changing my mind, yeah
Everybody tells me uuh, I need to let go, I know
But your cocoa butter skin now has got me beggin' for more

Well your heels keep on runnin' through my head now
Tryin' to deal but I'm coming to the end now

And you can walk those high heels baby right out of my life
So long you did me wrong
Yeah you can walk those high heels baby right out of my life
So long you did me wrong

Tell me why, why do you turn the blues skies cloudy gray
You know why I can't let you keep treatin' me this way
You've been chuckin' me around but uh, I kept my eyes shut, yeah
'Cause your shape is like an hourglass but I think the time's up

Well your heart is like a black piece of coal now
And I doubt that you ever had a soul now

And you can walk your cold heart baby out of my life
So long you did me wrong
Yeah you can walk your cold heart baby right out of my life
So long you did me wrong
So long you did me wrong
Leave me alone
