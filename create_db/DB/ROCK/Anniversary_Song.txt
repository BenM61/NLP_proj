Have you ever seen a sight as beautiful
As that of the rain-soaked purple
Of the white birch in spring?

Have you ever felt more fresh or wonderful
Than on a warm fall night 
Under a Mackerel sky,
The smell of grapes on the wind?

Well I have known all these things
And the joys that they can bring
And I'll share them all for a cup of coffee
And to wear your ring

Have you ever had the pleasure of watching
A quiet winter's snow slowly gathering
Like simple moments adding up?

Have you ever satisfied a gut feeling
To follow a dry dirt road that's beckoning you
To the heart of a shimmering summer's day?

Well I have known all these things
And the joys that they can bring
And I'll share them all for a cup of coffee
And to wear your ring

And I don't know how I survived those days
Before I held your hand
Well I never thought that I would be the one
To admit that the moon and the sun
Shine so much more brighter when
Seen through two pairs of eyes than
When seen through just one

Have you ever seen a sight as beautiful
As a face in a crowd of people
That lights up just for you?

Have you ever felt more fresh or wonderful
As when you wake 
By the side of that boy or girl 
Who has pledged their love to you?

Well I have known all these things
And the joys that they can bring
And now every morning there's a cup of coffee 
And I wear your ring
