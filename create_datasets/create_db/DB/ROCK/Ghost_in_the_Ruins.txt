Got a limousine
I want to show it
Future's looking good
I'll probably blow it
Had some parents once
But you'd never know it
Bank roll oversize
So what if they stole it

But who am I foolin'
I'm the king of the ruins

But I'm doin' well tonight
I got dreams to sell tonight

Got to belong
Try to hang on
Got to belong

Ghost in the ruins
I'm runnin' the street scene
Ghost in the ruins
Burnin' like gasoline
Ghost in the ruins
I'm takin' you in deep
East Side West Side playin' for keeps

See the runaway there on the corner
Just a throw away but somebody's daughter
Had a pretty face so somebody bought her
Sellin' her soul away so put in your order

She knows what she's doin'
She's a ghost in the ruins
She's doin' it well tonight
Got dreams to sell tonight
She wants to belong
Knows what to do
She's got to hang on
Ghost in the ruins
I'm running the street scene
Ghost in the ruins
Burning like gasoline
Ghost in the ruins
I'm takin' you in deep
East Side West Side
Playin' for keeps

I know
I know you know
I know
I know you know
I know
I know you know
I don't know anymore
I'm tellin' you
I don't know anymore
I'm tellin' you
I don't know anymore
