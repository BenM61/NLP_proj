Listen while you read!
In the night, though we're apart,
There's a ghost of you within my haunted heart
Ghost of you, my lost romance,
Lips that laugh, eyes that dance

Haunted heart won't let me be,
Dreams repeat a sweet but lonely song to me
Dreams repeat a sweet but lonely song to me

Dreams are dust, it's you who must belong to me
And thrill my haunted heart,
Be still my haunted heart

Dreams are dust, it's you who must belong to me
And thrill my haunted heart,
Be still my haunted heart
