Last night put the heavy on me
Woke up and I'm feeling lonely
This world gotta a way of showing me (showing me)
Some days it'll lift you up
Some days it'll call your bluff
Man, most of my days I ain't got enough

And all I know
Is You're my only hope

When I'm up when I'm down (uh, huh)
When the wolves come around (tell me)
When my feet hit the ground
I just need, I just need You
On my darkest days (uh, huh)
When I'm losing faith (tell me)
No, it ain't gon' change
I just need, I just need You
Lord, I need You
Yeah, I just need You

Yeah, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me
Thy rod and thy staff

They comfort me when I'm beat down, broken
Hold my heart when it's split right wide open
Turn these eyes to my Soul Protector
Break the will of this born infector

'Cause all I know, all I know
Is You're my only hope

When I'm up when I'm down (uh, huh)
When the wolves come around (tell me)
When my feet hit the ground
I just need, I just need You
On my darkest days (uh, huh)
When I'm losing faith (tell me)
No, it ain't gon' change
I just need, I just need You
Lord, I need You
Yeah, I just need You

When You pull me closer, I come to life
When You pull me closer, I come to life
When You pull me closer, I come to life
When You pull me closer, I come to life

When I'm up when I'm down
When my feet hit the ground
On my darkest days
No, it ain't gon' change
Oh Lord, I need You

When I'm up when I'm down
When the wolves come around
When my feet hit the ground
Yeah, I need, I need, I need, I need You
On my darkest days
When I'm losing faith
No, it ain't gon' change
Ain't no way this thing gon' change, it's You

I need, is You
I need
On my darkest days
When I'm losing faith
I need You, I need, Is You, I need
Every single day, every breath I take
I need You
I need You
