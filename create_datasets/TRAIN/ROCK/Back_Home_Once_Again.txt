(Theme From The T.V. Series "The Paper Lads")

Come along with me
The day can breathe once more
To hear the sound of closing doors
The night has opened up its eyes to see day
A thousand moving just as one
A feeling that's so certain
That when this day is done
The paper lads will -

Come with the dawn, casting light on the play
Acting it out in our own special way
Making our entrance and reading the lines
The story of people who live by the Tyne

Back home once again
The streets that seemed so long
They're waking now
The job is done
See people run to catch the wheels of their lives
The cities reading every line
But while it sleeps you're working
In a world that's just your own
For paper lads alone -

In the dawn going round every day
Seeing your home town in different ways
Carry the news, solving problems you find
Though young who knows what goes on in your mind
