Can't forget the day, 
That you walked into my life
It was just the kind of thing, 
That was soo right on time
After all that love changes, 
My heart had locked the door
Then that gurl released her magic 
And made me love once more
 
Like the warm rays of the sun her sweet love 
Keeps shining down on me, 
Oh oh, only one turned 
Why life around and wit one kiss she set me free

She's given me joy, joy, joy
That gurl she brings me joy
She's given me joy, joy, joy 
She brings me joy

Goodbye to loneliness, 
And so long to my heartache,
Now that joy has taken over, 
And decided to stay
Her love lifts me up, 
Like no other love before, 
With every beat of my heart, 
I'm holding on, hey

Just look what she's done for me, 
Just erased all the sadness away, oh oh oh, 
I could never repay her debt, 
'Cause she keeps loving me more and more

She's given me joy, joy, joy
That gurl she brings me joy
She's given me joy, joy, joy 
She brings me joy

She's given me (joy), 
Check one check two, 
Can't hold back I'm in love with you
Can't hold back I'm in love with you
Girl you're my joy
