I burn a hole through your stare,
It's like your not really there.
I scream and pull my own hair.
I turn into Linda Blair.

I swing your nose, I hit it.
You look at me, Just lick it.
You smile and I say quit it.
You think your sexy with it.

You love it, You love it, 
You love it when I'm mad
You love it, You love it
You love me when I'm bad
You love it, You love it,
You love me when I'm bad
You love it, love it baby,
When I'm hard to have.

I'm a ball of fury,
I'm just another bomb.
I put my fist through your teeth,
You feel like it, come on, come on, come on, come on... Shout! Shout! Shout! Shout! Shout!
Shout, Shout, the way I do.
Shout, shout baby yeah with attitude
Shout, Shout the way I do.
Shout!

You love it, You love it, 
You love it when I'm mad
You love it, You love it
You love me when I'm bad
You love it, You love it,
You love me when I'm bad
You love it, love it baby,
When I'm hard to have.

I burn a hole through your stare,
It's like your not really there.
I scream and pull my own hair.
I turn into Linda Blair.

Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on...
Shout! Shout! Shout! Shout! Shout!
Shout, Shout, the way I do.
Shout, shout baby yeah with attitude
Shout, Shout the way I do.
Shout!

You love it, You love it, 
You love it when I'm mad
You love it, You love it
You love me when I'm bad
You love it, You love it,
You love me when I'm bad
You love it, love it baby,
When I'm hard to have.
