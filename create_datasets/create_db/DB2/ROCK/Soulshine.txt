The world around gotcha down
You got high blood pressure, people pushing you around
And some wanna tell you how you should behave
Cut your hair the right way, tell you what to say,
Hang out with the right folks, become a fashion slave

But do you wanna feel free (and I say it again now)
But do you wanna feel freaky and free
But do you wanna feel free (I don't care where you come from)
Do you wanna feel free, free, free, free, freaky and free

Take your time
Unwind your mind
We all need a little soulshine
Take your time (go on, take it)
Unwind your mind
We could use a little soulshine

9 to 5, people tryin' to stay alive
Hard livin' in the city
You find a diamond in the sewer but the gas bills rise
But I got to say to them, "what's it all mean?"
You gotta take a loan
To pay the bill on the phone
Educated, graduated but you can't get a job

But do you wanna feel free (and I say it again now)
But do you wanna feel freaky and free
But do you wanna feel free (I don't care where you come from)
Do you wanna feel free, free, free, free, freaky and free

Take your time
Unwind your mind
We all need a little soulshine
Take your time (go on, take it)
Unwind your mind
We could use a little soulshine
