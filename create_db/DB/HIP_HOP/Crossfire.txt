Still on top of my game holding the fork
But the situation got me impatient start blowing your torch

Four O, no doubt
'Cus I am a BK villain
And this year I 'm passing out brass knuckle ass whooping

Ten years in this bitch, f*ck it, Switch speeds

But you wanna be the Jordan of rap
An I' be catch you on the rebound slam dunk two in your back

We in the making you move like is a dead zone
Steady 'causing damage
Now, what you stop for?
We hit you off for the brain that what we came for

You see I' m faster than you, faster than anybody
Fast like a hottie doing a buck sixty on the Bacardi
You couldn't spare my rage F the Porsche-a
You know I squash ya'

Daddy yo I'm hotter than Chinese chilly sauce mixed with musavie
I'm sick in the head invisible fleds
I'm shooting the stars I'm blacking the whites to blues
That right, yeah, I'm sickening with the Kung Fu

More complex then Mixo Flicks or Weird Al Yankovic
Supposing a remix stick with some sick shit
Pistachio absolute Tanqueray mix with tequila

Mother sucking fire breathing Godzilla
Ayo this party right here is straight fire

You take mine, you ain't that bad, you must be mad
You fucking faggot got mixed up with another dude
May peace and blessings be upon you
How you doing brother? Do, no

Look if I was in a position of giving us faith
(Listen)
Osama Bin Laden would have been shot in his face
(Missing)
Like every life he destroy in the World Trade
I ain't got no patients for the faggot less great

Couldn't wait to hit the wake with an O.G staff
Trained to shake'em, take'em and break'em in half
Using heavy caliber weapons for clearing the path

The same as we do in the ave nigga, look
(Look)
Is the legendary M.O.Piggidy back
Murdering tracks with Afu-Rigidy black

Bone crushing, bone breaking
