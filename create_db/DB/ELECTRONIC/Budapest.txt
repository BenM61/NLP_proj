Like a walking dog shifting by the flow
Easy slider wants to blow in Budapest

This endless feeling follows ghostly
And vicious as a plague you know where we are now?
In Budapest

A chest with no breath creeping through a darkness
An iced game of chess melting in Budapest

Building a gambling house in my head
Near the castle a cold hunter lays
In Budapest

Now, watch out
It's coming on

Tokaj running in my veins
What was soaking is now croaking in Budapest

Sniper holes across partitions of my soul
Street cars tearing up the skies of Budapest

Travestied gods, Transylvanian guns
I do hear and see surely I should run far from Budapest

Cave-accordions, they taste my flesh
And in fast motion, men are mean, mean, mean, mean and mesh
In Budapest

I may have a few contacts but no peace I could find
And the burning synagogues are lighting up all
Of Budapest

Paranoid express through excess and excess
Here I am just a guest who doesn't need to be blessed
In Budapest

Now, watch out
It's coming on

Paranoid express, take a, take a, take a deep breath
I don't wanna be blessed
I don't wanna be blessed

Suicide lust and no one is really to trust
I am the hider, the midnight rider
Hider, the midnight rider
