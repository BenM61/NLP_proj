I woke up to my world this morning
Took a long look in the looking glass
Last night I guess I had one or too many
Somebody tried to tell me I had no class
What ever happened to me

Maybe I've been living on lies
Never really had a dream come true
Then again I guess I never really tried
Now the years all slip away

And things are like they're gonna stay
All the roads I didn't take are just
One more thing in the back of my mind
Taking space and time

Wish I'd finished that book I never started
Maybe that's the story of my life
Should've learned to play that saxophone
So I could tell my song to the streetlight
Shouldn't have been so stuck on my own
Could've had a wife and a child
Should've made that house a home
I don't know why my life is so wild
Now the years all slip away

And things are like they're gonna stay
All the chances I didn't take are just
One more thing in the back of my mind
Taking space and time
One more thing in the back of my mind

So I'm thinking about a walk in the sunlight
I've got to get my shadow behind me
Try and make some sense of it all
With my feet on the ground and my heart still free
As the years will slip away

I'll let the cards fall where they may
And all the roads I didn't take will be just
One more thing in the back of my mind
As the years will slip away

And the cards fall as they may
All the chances I didn't take will be just
One more thing in the back of my mind
Taking space and time

One more thing in the back of my mind
One more thing in the back of my mind
