I'm a desperado
Underneath your window
I see your silhouette
Are you my Juliet
I feel a mad connection
With your body
Shake your bonbon
Shake your bonbon
Shake your bonbon

I want to be your lover
Your only Latin lover
We'll go around the world in a day
Don't say no, no
Shake it my way, oh
Shake your bonbon
Shake your bonbon
Shake your bonbon

You're a Mata Hari
I want to know your story
In the Sahara sun
I want to be the one to make fun
That's gonna come and take you,
Make you
Shake your bonbon
Shake your bonbon
Shake your bonbon

Up in the Himalayas
C'mon I want to lay ya
We'll go around the world in a day
Don't say no, no
Shake it my way, oh
Shake your bonbon
Shake your bonbon
Shake your bonbon

Hola amiga, hola amiga
You're my temple of desire
Hola amiga, hola amiga
Let my spirit take you higher
We'll go around the world in a day
Don't say no, no
Shake it my way, oh
Shake your bonbon
Shake your bonbon
Shake your bonbon

We'll go around the world in a day
Don't say no, no
Shake it my way, oh
Shake your bonbon
Shake your bonbon
Shake your bonbon

I'm a desperado
Underneath your window
I see your silhouette
Are you my Juliet
I feel a mad connection
With your body
Shake your bonbon
Shake your bonbon
Shake your bonbon

I want to be your lover
Your only Latin lover
We'll go around the world in a day
Around the world with you in a day
