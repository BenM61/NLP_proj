I was born near the factory, where Henry wrote his name
Sometimes I could hear the whistle blow
My father pushed his headlights, through that northern English rain
He was proud of everything he drove

And mother's hair was fashioned, for that very special day
She cried on board the liner and tried to wave good-bye
Five weeks of remembering, those names we couldn't say
Staring at the South Pacific sky

I share my life with the immigrants and the ramblers
I drink my wine with the middlemen and the gamblers

I spend my time with schemers on the phone
But when I dream, I dream alone
I dream alone, I dream alone, I dream alone

As soon as we set foot on the sun-burnt land
The mountains all around us ran with fire
My family knew right then that our best laid plans
Would have to reach a lot higher

I share my life with the immigrants and the ramblers
I drink my wine with the middlemen and the gamblers

I spend my time with schemers on the phone
But when I dream, I dream alone
I dream alone, I dream alone, I dream alone

Rows of simple houses, kids out on the street
Windows all aglow from the brand new TV sets
Screen door always slamming in that endless summer heat
My father working late to pay his debts

My father working late to pay hid debts
Now my little boy is safe in the comfort of his bed
The monster he invented we both chased into the night
His puzzle lies in pieces by the book that we just read
The story of a man who touched the sky

I share my life with the immigrants and the ramblers
I drink my wine with the middlemen and the gamblers

I spend my time with schemers on the phone
But when I dream, I dream alone

I share my life with the immigrants and the ramblers
I drink my wine with the middlemen and the gamblers

I spend my time with schemers on the phone
But when I dream, I dream alone
I dream alone, I dream alone, I dream alone
