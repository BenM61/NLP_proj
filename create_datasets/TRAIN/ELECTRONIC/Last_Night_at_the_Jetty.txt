Dreams that we once had
Did we have them anyway?
Seems that we once had
Now we'll have them all the time

Didn't we have a good time?
I know we had a real time now
Who could say we're not just as we were?
No one could deny
My, my I know

I don't want to describe something that I'm not
I don't want to hide the hopes that I have
I want to enjoy what's meant to enjoy
Not try to find slights and slurs to employ

Say what you will
I've a pretty sound mind to go
I know I could not go
Even if I had the eyes to try

You have your ways
I have my ways
We have our ways
And I'll call you my friend

And I'll call you my dream that I once had
Did I have it, anyway?
Seems that I once had
Now I'll have them all the time

Didn't I have a good time?
I know I had a real time now
Who could I say I'm not just as I was?
No one could deny
My, my
