When your mind goes blank in the pouring rain
And you can't get back on your feet again
Well your girlfriend tells you the world is dead
And it just ain't workin' inside your head.

Now get along little doggie get on
No one else is gonna sing your song
You can f*ck recovery cause you're already gone.

I'm a stoned jet fighter with a heart of gold
Well I'm really mad and I'm really old
And I rule this planet from high above
And it's time I sacrificed all my love

And if you don;t like what you see
Go ahead and take it out on me.
I'm the big pig apocalypse and I ain't hard to please

I'm a stoned jet fighter with a heart of gold
And I rule this planet from high above
And I take what I take because I want what I want
And tonight I'm gonna rock with the gods and punks

Well I'm a stoned jet fighter with a heart of gold
And I rule this planet from high above
And I take what I take because I want what I want
And tonight I'm gonna rock with the gods and punks

Rock on
