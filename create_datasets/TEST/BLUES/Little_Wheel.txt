Let me be your little wheel, babe, till your big wheel come
Let me be your little wheel, babe, till your big wheel come
Lord, I'd do more rollin' than your big wheel ever done

I wanna roll you, baby, roll you all over town
Wanna roll with you, baby, roll you all over town
Well, I'll roll you so easy, baby, that you never know

Let me roll with you, baby, roll you all over town
Let me roll with you, baby, roll you all over town
Well, I'll roll you so easy that you never know

Let me be your little wheel, babe, till your big wheel come
Let me be your little wheel, babe, till your big wheel come
Well, I'd do more rollin' than your big wheel ever done

Let me roll with you, baby
Let me roll with you, baby
Let me roll with you, baby
