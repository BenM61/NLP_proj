I'm fixing a drink in the morning
With a wavy tongue
You may have stayed too long

You're splitting apart at the seams
From the hospital call
You've known him so long

If there's a God up in the air
Someone looking over everyone
At least you got something to fall back on

Deep in the heart of the country
Was a house I built from logs
A raven and a lady hawk

Quiet and calm through the day
See the sun burn through the fog
Approaching was a yellow dog

If there's a God up in the air
Someone looking over everyone
At least you got something to fall back on
And what are people really for?
Does any body even care?
I'll bet you get a lot of compliments down there

If there's a God up in the air
Someone looking over everyone
At least you got something to fall back on
And do you got something to say?
Isn't something coming over you?
Do you got important things still left to do?
