I was there when you needed someone 
Look now, baby, see what you have undone 
I did most of the talking 
But you were the one who lied 

Bye-bye, baby, our love is tumblin' down 
I can't be hangin' around 
Love on the wrong side of town 

You were gone when I needed you by my side 
There was no one to dry the tears from my eyes 
You were the one who cheated 
But I was the one who cried 

Bye-bye, baby, our love is tumblin' down 
I can't be hangin' around 
Love on the wrong side of town
Love on the wrong side of town
Bye-bye, baby, love on the wrong side of town
Bye-bye, baby
