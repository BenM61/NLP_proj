Hey, tell me everything you really want to say
Cause when I saw you last night at the palace
You were hunched over your whiskey, avoiding me
And anyway, who do you think you are?
You used to borrow my car and drive through the old city
Like a bastard prince who thought he deserved the world

But something made me love you
I guess I was so naive...

You were trusted with my love and now you avoid me
You got busted fooling around and now you ignore me
The truth is like fire in this town
To the prince with the paper crown

By the way, do you even remember her name?
Was it Louise on her knees, carrying some disease
She got from her junkie friends in Amsterdam

You used to whisper like a cat
Now you hide from me like a nervous rat

But something made me love you
I guess I was so naive...

You were trusted with my love and now you avoid me
You got busted fooling around and now you ignore me
I was lusted and tossed out and now you deplore me
My chain? rusted and I
