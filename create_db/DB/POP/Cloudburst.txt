I was blue and I was always wearing a frown
Because my gal had turned me down.
Then we met and you can bet
I knew from the first, you were my love,
And that's when the old gray cloudburst.
My heart really flew, the day you caught my eye.
I hope that we two will never say "Good-bye."
Clouds of gray have silver linings
When they reverse. I found your love
And that's when the old gray cloudburst.

Hey, baby
I'm gonna tell you 'bout your lovin'
And your kissn' and your huggin'
And your sweet turtle-dovin' pretty baby.
I won't be satisfied til I hear 'em play,
"Here comes the bride."

Listen to me baby and I don't mean maybe.
Listen to my story, it's terrifficly true.
I gotta find a way of telling
You that I really go for you.
I hope you really believe me baby
'cause I certainly do.

'Cause you're thrillin' me, you're really,
Really thrilling when you tell me
That you probably got a kind of crush on me,
That moves me, grooves me.
How divine can one woman be?

Well little darlin', you got me fallin'.
You got me goofy and gay.
I'm gonna get carried away.
Just think, you're gonna be mine someday.

Oh, let's spin a little,
Park a little, stop a little,
Spark a little, live a little, love a little,
Maybe turtle-dove a little baby.
Every time you hold me so near,
Nobody loves me like you, dear.

Let's stop a little, squeeze a little,
Probably maybe tease a little,
Try a little, sigh a little,
Maybe have to cry a little bit,
'cause to tell you the truth,
I'm gonna love you and that's it.

'Cause I love you baby,
Love you baby, love you baby, love you baby,
With all my heart.
Oh, listen to me while I say I let
A lot little ladies get away
Because I know, I know pretty baby, I know,
I know, pretty baby,
I know you're the one, yes you're the one.
I knew when I met you
What a break it was to get you.

When it's cloudy and gray and that's the worst.
How do you cause the cloud to burst?
You got to find a lover,
Find a lover, find a lover, find a lover.

If it's silvery under clouds of gray.
How do you chase the clouds away?
You gotta find a little girl
And make her love you a lot.
Don't ever leave unless you flip your
Lid and really want to ruin the plot.

Sounds easy does it?
Light as a breeze thru the trees.
Boy, how pleasant was it?
Pleasant as one summer day, boy.

It's so wonderful, what a love can do.
Look at what love has done for you.
Hey, I'm a lucky lover, lucky lover,
I got the love you should discover.

I was blue and I was always wearing a frown,
Because my gal had turned me down.
Then we met and you can bet
I knew from the first, You were my love,
And that's when the old gray cloudburst.

Take a look at me. Boy take another look,
Take another look, take another look,
Take another good, long, look at me.
Love opened my eyes and now I see,

Clouds of gray have silver linings
When they reverse. I found your love,
And that's when the old, gray, cloudburst.
That's when the old, gray, cloud burst!
