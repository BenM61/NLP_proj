Like love on the run there will be tomorrow
The stars and the sun every beam Ill follow
Together were dancing all night long
Together were dancing on and on
The sound of the drum keeps my soul depending
Each day and each night and its never ending
Together were dancing all night long
Together were dancing on and on

Like love on the run there will be tomorrow
The stars and the sun every beam Ill follow
Together were dancing all night long
Together were dancing on and on
The sound of the drum keeps my soul depending
Each day and each night and its never ending
Together were dancing all night long
Together were dancing on and on

Like love on the run there will be tomorrow
The stars and the sun every beam Ill follow
Together were dancing all night long
Together were dancing on and on
The sound of the drum keeps my soul depending
Each day and each night and its never ending
Together were dancing all night long
Together were dancing on and on

Like love on the run there will be tomorrow
The stars and the sun every beam Ill follow
Together were dancing all night long
Together were dancing on and on

If you could look into the sun again,
Cause I believe now and then...

On the run (6x)
Like love on the run there will be tomorrow
The stars and the sun every beam Ill follow
Together were dancing all night long
Together were dancing on and on
The sound of the drum keeps my soul depending
Each day and each night and its never ending
Together were dancing all night long
Together were dancing on and on

Like love on the run there will be tomorrow
The stars and the sun every beam Ill follow
Together were dancing all night long
Together were dancing on and on
The sound of the drum keeps my soul depending
Each day and each night and its never ending
Together were dancing all night long
Together were dancing on and on
