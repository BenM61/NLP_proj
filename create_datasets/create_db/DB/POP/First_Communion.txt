She can wait he can wait we can wait
They can wait
She can wait he can wait we can wait
They can wait

Prisms have kissed my lids
Seasalt was rubbed on my hips
Prisms have spit on my lids
Moon lasered light on me,
Prisms have kissed my lids
Seasalt was rubbed on my hips
Prisms have spit on my lids
Moon lasered light on me

Assaulting holiness
Where is Allah?

Give it to me my first communion
Need that bread my mouth wide open
Give it to me my first communion
Mirror me and plague the youth of
Bitter youth
The asylums
Gutter weeds
Our blood's a fence to protect
Can it separate the wings from our bodies
If we do we won't be able to fly, no

Our blood's a fence to protect
Can it separate the wings from our bodies
If we do we won't be able to fly, no

We can't separate the wings that
Carry us
We can't separate the wings that
Carry us
