Caught up in my life
Waiting to be set free
Waiting to find my answer

Come if it feels right
Now is the time to be
No need to find forgiveness

'Cause in a month some child wants to make love
Fantasize about some vision
Funny how the lost guy makes the deal 
("the deal"
("the deal"
("the deal"
("the deal"
("the deal"
("the deal"

Just when you thought you were lonely
They put you under the right spell
Wake up tomorrow you're gonna be
Living the right life

Oh, living it

Living in the streets
Try to find a better way
Elevate or take me higher

There's a place for me
All I want a new sedan
Elevator take or me higher, take me higher, take me higher, take me higher

Just when you thought you were lonely
They put you under the right spell
Wake up tomorrow you're gonna be
Living the right life

Oh, living it
Oh, living it

Just when you thought you were lonely
They came along with the right spell
Wake up tomorrow you're gonna be
Living the right life
Living the right life

'Cause in a month some child wants to make love
Fantasize about some vision
Funny how the lost guy makes the deal 
("the deal"
("the deal"
("the deal"
("the deal"
("the deal"
("the deal"

Just when you thought you were lonely
They put you under the right spell
Wake up tomorrow you're gonna be
Living the right life
