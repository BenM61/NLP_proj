(Girl one) I swear I told myself that she's the one
(Girl two) I hate myself because I love her, too
(Girl one) She don't give me drama type that you bring home to mama
(Girl two) I try breaking up but I can't get enough

Got both of 'em on my mind
I don't know where to draw the line
Never been in this place before
But I gotta let one of 'em go

Somebody help me, somebody help me now
'Cause I'm in love with these two women
And my heart ain't tryna listen
Somebody help me, somebody help me now
'Cause I just can't keep up with 'em
But I gotta make a decision

I've got
Double vision
I've got
Double vision
I've got
Double vision
I've got
Double vision

Uh why you teasin' with your pants on?
Go ahead, take 'em off this a bad song
Play the ringtone, pour some alcohol
I don't wanna judge you, babe but I can see your thong
On, off, kissing on your tickle spots
Faded, having double vision standing under mistletoe
Cane, gold chains and with your cameltoe
She could say you can't touch just like Hammer though
I'm on to the crack of dawn
Lifting up your skirt, I'm a flirt, getting mega dome
Call a friend through, use my iPhone
Tell her come over right now, she never got home

Got both of 'em on my mind
I don't know where to draw the line
Never been in this place before
But I gotta let one of them go

Somebody help me, somebody help me now
'Cause I'm in love with these two women
And my heart ain't tryna listen
Somebody help me, somebody help me now
'Cause I just can't keep up with 'em
But I gotta make a decision

I've got
Double vision
I've got
Double vision
I've got (I've got)
Double vision
I've got, I've got
Double vision
I've got

Somebody help me out
I'm in love with these two women
Somebody help me out
I'm in love with these two women
Somebody help me out
I can't make a decision
Somebody help me out
Oh oh

I've got
Double vision
I've got
Double vision

Somebody help me, somebody help me now
'Cause I'm in love with these two women
And my heart ain't tryna listen
Somebody help me, somebody help me now
'Cause I just can't keep up with 'em
But I gotta make a decision

I've got
