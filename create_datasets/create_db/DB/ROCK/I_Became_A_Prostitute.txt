There's a girl in the crowd and she's bawling her eyes out
Only girl in the town with her fingers in eyelids
And we're all fine in the back of your mind if we do what we like
Then we could be with you tonight and if we bleed you dry
And we're alright in the back of our minds if we do what we like
Then we could be with you tonight and if they bleed you dry
Taken half the tide, taken all your tide and if we bleed you dry
Bleed, you dry, we've taken half your tide and if we bleed you dry

You are the bearer of a womb without love, you could have had it all
Is that what you said, is that what you said on a low ride
You said, in your hands you'll stay all with me today
You are the bearer of a womb without love, you could have had it all
Is that what you said, is that what you said on a low ride
You said, in your hands you'll stay all with me today

There's a hand in the till still believing what she sells
Only girl in the town with her fingers in eyelids
And we're all fine in the back of your mind
If we do what you like then we could be with you tonight
And if they bleed you dry, and taken half the tide, and taken all your tide

You are the bearer of a womb without love, you could have had it all
Is that what you said, is that what you said on a low ride
You said, in your hands you'll stay all with me today
You are the bearer of a womb without love, you could have had it all
Is that what you said, is that what you said on a low ride
You said, in your hands you'll stay all with me today

Bleed you dry, I'm taking half your tide and if I bleed you dry
