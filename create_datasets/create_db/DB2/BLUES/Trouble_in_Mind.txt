Trouble in mind babe I'm blue
but I won't be blue always
Yes the sun gonna shine
in my back door someday

I'm goin' down down to the river
I'm gonna take my rockin' chair
Lord if the blues overtake me
I'm gonna rock on away from here

'Cause I'm trouble in mind you know that I'm blue
but I won't be blue always
Yes the sun gonna shine
in my back door someday

I'm gonna lay lay my head
on some sad old railroad iron
I'm gonna let that 2:19
pacify my mind

I'm trouble in mind baby you know that I'm blue
but I won't be blue always
Yes the sun gonna shine
in my back door someday
