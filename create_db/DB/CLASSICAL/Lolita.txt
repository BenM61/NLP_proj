Ever since I was a young boy,
I've played the silver ball.
From Soho down to Brighton
I must have played them all.
But I ain't seen nothing like him
In any amusement hall,
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball!

He stands like a statue,
Becomes part of the machine.
Feeling all the bumpers
Always playing clean.
He plays by intuition,
The digit counters fall.
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball!

He's a pinball wizard
There has got to be a twist.
A pin ball wizard,
Got such a supple wrist.

('How do you think he does it?)
I don't know!
(What makes him so good?')

Well, he ain't got no distractions
Can't hear those buzzers and bells,
Don't see lights a flashin'
Plays by sense of smell.
Always has a replay,
And never tilts at all
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball.

He can't beat me now
I've always been the champ
I know every trick
No freak's gonna beat my hand

Even on my usual table,
He can beat the best.
His disciples lead him in,
And he just does the rest.

He's got crazy flipper fingers,
I never seen him fall,
That deaf, dumb, blind kid,
Sure plays a mean pinball.

He's a pinball wizard,
There has to be a twist.
A pinball wizard,
Got such a supple wrist.

He's a pinball wizard,
His score's a trillion more.
A pinball wizard,
The world's new pinball lord.
He's scoring more!
He's scoring more!
More more more more!

I thought I was the Bally table king,
But I just handed my pinball crown to him.
To him!
To him!
