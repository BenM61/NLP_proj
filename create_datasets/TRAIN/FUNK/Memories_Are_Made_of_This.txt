The sweet sweet memories you gave-a me
You can't beat the memories you gave-a me
 
Take one fresh and tender kiss
(The sweet sweet memories you gave-a me
You can't beat the memories you gave-a me)
Add one stolen night of bliss
(The sweet sweet memories you gave-a me
You can't beat the memories you gave-a me)
One girl, one boy; some grief, some joy
(I was rover, but now it's over  
It was a happy day when you came my way to tell me)
Memories are made of this
(of the sweet sweet memories you gave-a me
You can't beat the memories you gave-a me)
Don't forget a small moon beam
(The sweet sweet memories you gave-a me
You can't beat the memories you gave-a me)
Fold in lightly with a dream
Your lips and mine, two sips of wine
(The sweet sweet memories you gave-a me
You can't beat the memories you gave-a me)
Memories are made of this
(I was rover, but now it's over 
It was a happy day when you came my way to tell me)
Then add the wedding bells, one house where lovers dwell 
Three little kids for the flavor, stir carefully through the days
See how the flavor stays These are the dreams you will savor
With His blessings from above
(The sweet sweet memories you gave-a me
You can't beat the memories you gave-a me)
Serve it generously with love
(The sweet sweet memories you gave-a me
You can't beat the memories you gave-a me)
One man, one wife, on love through life
(I was rover, but now it's over
It was a happy day when you came my way to tell me)
Memories are made of this
