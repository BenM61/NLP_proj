My funny Valentine, sweet comic Valentine 
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet you're my favorite work of art 
 
Is your figure less than Greek? 
Is your mouth a little weak? 
When you open it to speak
Are you smiling? 
But don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little Valentine, stay 
Each day is Valentine's Day
