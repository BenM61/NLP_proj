Walking with my head down
Counting every step
Hoping that the next one
Brings me closer to the man I was
'Cause I was way better
Maybe it's because
We were together

I said I'm looking for myself
And I still can't find me
That's right, I'm looking for myself
Who am I, someone remind me
I'm looking for myself
All my life I'm searching
I said I'm looking for myself
And somehow I ran right into

You
(Looking for myself)
You
(I, I I, I I I)
You
(Looking for myself)

And somehow I ran right into you

Escapin' on the tightrope
Trying not to fall
If I don't keep my balance
I know, I will lose it all
I, I should have known better
And it's all my fault
That we're not together

I said I'm looking for myself
And I still can't find me
That's right, I'm looking for myself
Who am I, someone remind me
I'm looking for myself
All my life I'm searching
I said I'm looking for myself
And somehow I ran right into

You
(Looking for myself)
You
(I, I I, I I I)
You
(Looking for myself)

And somehow I ran right into you, girl

I was on a journey,
Tryin' to figure out who I really was
Then I realized that,
When you're not here,
Half of me is gone
So in order for me to find me,
I had to find you
You know
(You)
And I got a funny feeling that
You want more, you are
Unless you find me
It's like, you look in the mirror
And you see the person that you truly love

I said I'm looking for myself
And I still can't find me
That's right, I'm looking for myself
Who am I, someone remind me
I'm looking for myself
All my life I'm searching
I said I'm looking for myself
And somehow I ran right into

You
(Looking for myself)
You
(I, I I, I I I)
You
(Looking for myself)

And somehow I ran right into you
You
Hey, looking for myself
(I I, I I, I I I)
And somehow I ran right into you
