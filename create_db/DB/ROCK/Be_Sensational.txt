make me love you, be sensational
make me fall for your mistakes, scratches and holes
make me close my eyes of ease before you
hear me saying

hear me when i try not recall
how come everything does fall the way it falls
but my heart for you unless you help it
see me praying

see me when i bow in your presence
see how the love i'm wearing kills all my good sense
know you're my reason and lunacy
try me running

try me have a taste of what you miss
try and understand now's the right time to kiss
oh my love, there ain't no riddle here
catch me falling

more i want you want more
more i need you need more
better stronger happier faster
always our anger beats us down

more i want you want more
more i need you need more
better stronger happier faster
always our anger beats us down

see me when i bow in your presence
see how the love i'm wearing kills all my good sense
know you're my reason and lunacy
try me running

try me have a taste of what you miss
try and understand now's the right time to kiss
oh my love, there ain't no riddle here
catch me falling
