Courage and cowards move heroes to ecstasy,
Welcomes of war and wounds, vigil and victory.
Structures of atoms dance, sugar towards the taster,
Prey to the predator, love as we're falling down.

Through light and laughter flow, to dirge and death we go.
Mindless processions move, lanterns of burning towns.
Welcome to fray and feast, bliss in all sorrows found.
Rhythm and random moves and waves of revelations.

Patterns I'm finding
As pain and joy and sorrow mingle.
Patterns we're finding
Our faces raised in adoration.

Deserts are paradise, awake to genocides.
Delight and suffering, these roles that we have found.
Nourished by food we eat, hungered by waste excrete.
From apes or sons of god, let every act be sacred.

Patterns I'm finding
As pain and joy and sorrow mingle.
Patterns we're finding
Our faces raised in adoration.
