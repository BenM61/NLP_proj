Can we share tonight the years we've been apart baby
From the time we said goodbye until now
How the nights we laughed and loved still feel like yesterday
How I'm hoping you still feel the same
(So) strange we're standing here after all this time
Strange when the present and the past collides
Memories of our days apart I feel they're fading fast
Silence for my questions here at last

Are you ready now for me to love you
Are you ready now to give this love a try
Are you ready now for me to give you trust to give you truth
Are you ready now for me
Ready now for me to say I love you

The look upon your face shows no surprise baby
Guess you always knew when things played on my mind
I believe in second chances
I believe in love for life
I believe you can maybe lose love once but never twice

Throw the past aside
Let's make up for lost time
If we let this love pass by we may never find these feelings again in our lives
