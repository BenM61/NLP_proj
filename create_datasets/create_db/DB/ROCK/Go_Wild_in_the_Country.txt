I don't like you, I don't like you, town
I don't wanna like you, I'll shop around
I don't want you, I don't want you, town
I don't wanna want you, I'll shop around, I'll shop around

I can get a train, I don't need no hamburgers
No take-away, I want my own game
No bacon steak, no strawberry milkshake, I wanna keep it
I'm sick of seeing signe to eat walking down these lonely streets

Wild, go wild, go wild in the country
Where snakes in the grass are absolutely free
Wild, go wild, go wild in the country
Where snakes in the grass are absolutely free

I don't know you, I won't know you, town
I don't wanna know you, I'll shop around, I'll shop around

I can get a train, I don't need no hamburgers
No take-away, I want my own game
No bacon steak, no strawberry milkshake
I do better, well, I do better

Sweet from the trees, nakes in the breeze
But I got no boiled chicken, I wanna go hunting and fishing

I can get a plane, I don't need no suitcases, 'cause truth loves to go naked

I wanna picnic, 'cause I get sick
Got no boiled chicken, I wanna go hunting and fishing

I can get a train, I don't need no hamburgers
No take-away, I want my own game
