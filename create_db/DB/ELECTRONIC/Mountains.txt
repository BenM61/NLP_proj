Once upon a time in a land called Fantasy
Seventeen mountains stood so high.
The sea surrounded them and together they would be
The only thing that ever made you cry
You said the devil told you that another mountain would appear
Every time somebody broke your heart
He said the sea would one day overflow with all your tears,
And love will always leave you lonely

But I say it's only mountains and the sea
Love will conquer if you just believe (oh yeah)
It's only mountains and the sea
There's nothing greater, you and me

Once upon a time in a haystack of despair,
Happiness sometimes hard to find. (yeah)
Africa divided, hijack in the air,
It's enough to make you want to lose your mind

But I say it's only mountains and the sea
Love will conquer if you just believe (Oh yeah)
It's only mountains and the sea
There's nothing greater, you and me

Guitars and drums on the one

(Bobby on the drum, ah!)

It's only mountains (oh yeah) and the sea. (and the girls sing)
There's nothing greater, you and me
