I guess I left myself wide open
I guess I earned that weight
Feel that weight, feel that weight pushin' down

I know you saw, you saw it comin'
Well, I saw it comin', too
Now with eyes all over you
I can't help but wonder
What we'll do under that weight, that weight
Take the bait, take, take, take

Feel that weight, feel that weight pushin' down
Where's my friend, I need a hero now
Can I push that hand away, push that hand away?
Lips and cheek and full of drink and tell me what I said

I thought I knew you, I thought I knew myself
Never guessed the cost, the waste
Just a taste is all I wanted
It's been a long time, a long time comin'
But this is how we make or break
Take, take, take

Feel that weight, feel that weight pushin' down
What the hell we steppin' into now?
Can I push that hand away, push that hand away?
Pinch and wink and full of drink and shoulder to the weight

Feel that weight, feel that weight pushin' down
I thought I knew you, I thought I knew myself
Can I push that hand away, push that hand away?
Push that hand away, push that hand away?
Push that hand away, push that hand away?
Push that hand away, push that hand away, can I?

Hey you push that hand away, push that hand away?
Push that hand away, push that hand away?
C'mon push it, push it, push it, push it
Push it, push it, push it, push it
