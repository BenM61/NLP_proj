From the hills they came
From backwoods without a name
Carrying their guitars and a heart full of southern soul
Down the dusty roads of Caroline
The Tucker boys were friends of mine
They echoed through the lonely pines
Running down the road 
And the day the Caldwells died
Before the rugged cross we cried
A voice from deep inside
Said you gotta carry on
And on and

We are brothers of the Southland
Singers in the same band
Spirits on the wind
Standing on this stage together
Our song goes on forever
We're part of Heaven's plan
We're brothers of the Southland
Brothers of the Southland

Tattered old revival tent
And ragged voices heaven-sent
Singing hallelujah and dancing in the aisles
Ronnie was a barefoot child
An angel's voice and the devil's smile
We only had him for a little while
But the world still sings his songs

And the day the Freebird died
Before the rugged cross we cried
The grey ghost he rides 
Said you gotta carry on
And on and

We are brothers of the Southland Singers in the same band
Spirits on the wind
Standing on this stage together
Our song goes on forever
We're part of Heaven's plan
We're brothers of the Southland
Brothers of the Southland
We're brothers of the Southland

And the day Duane Allman died
With Barry Oakley by his side
They took one last midnight ride

We are brothers of the Southland
Singers in the same band
Spirits on the wind
Standing on this stage together
A bridge across forever
We're part of Heaven's plan
We're brothers of the Southland
Brothers of the Southland
Brothers of the Southland
We're brothers of the Southland
