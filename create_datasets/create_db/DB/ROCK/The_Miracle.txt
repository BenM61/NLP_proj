The sun belongs to the sky
The leaf belongs to the tree
The grape belongs to the vine
And you, you belong to me

isn't it a miracle
It?s another miracle
Thank God for the miracle
You belong to me

I used to think that time was just a thing to pass away
Love was just the game that children play
God was just another word to say
And so was something in a song

And I put down the fools who said that life was meaningful
Laughed when someone mentioned miracle
Cried ?cause such things were impossible
And then you came alone

Now I believe, I believe
Miracles can be
And in my song I thank God
You belong to me

Yes, I put down the fools who said that life was meaningful
Laughed when someone mentioned miracle
Cried ?cause some things were impossible
And then you came alone

Now I believe, I believe
Miracles can be
And in my song I thank God
You belong to me

Now I believe, I believe
Miracles can be
And in my song I thank God
You belong to me

Now I believe
