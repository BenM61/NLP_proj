I got me ten fine toes
To wiggle in the sand
Lots of idle fingers
Snap to my command
A lovely pair of heels
That kick that beat the band
Contemplating nature can be fascinating
Add to these a nose that I can thumb
And a mouth by gum have I
To tell the whole darn world
If you don't happen to like it
Deal me out
Thank you kindly, pass me by
Pass me by, pass me by
If you don't happen to like it, pass me by

Lots of idle fingers
Snap to my command
Contemplating nature can be fascinating

I'll tell the whole darn world
If you don't happen to like it
Deal me out
Thank you kindly, pass me by
Pass me by, pass me by
If you don't happen to like it, pass me by
