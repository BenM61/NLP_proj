Yes we are goin' out tonight 
We ain't gonna tell nobody where 
Gonna forget about the party lights 
Just me and you lovin' there 
I'm gonna talk sweet talk and tell you that you're mine 
At a place nobody can find, yeah, nobody can find, yeah (oh, shit)

Oh we'll burn this candle light 
And if you get cold, I'll just squeeze you tight 
We'll be together, day before day 
It takes so long to overcome your lovin' ways 
I'm gonna talk sweet talk and tell you that you're mine 
At a place nobody can find, yeah, nobody can find, yeah (uh, huh)

We don't need no company 
Everywhere we go, yeah 
For your lovin' we need a secret hole 
Where they can love, love, yeah 
Where they can love, love, yeah 

And that's why we're goin' out tonight 
Ain't gonna tell nobody where 
I'm gonna talk sweet talk and tell you that you're mine 
At a place nobody can find, yeah, nobody can find, yeah 
I'm gonna squeeze you, I'm gonna tease you 
At a place nobody can find, yeah, nobody can find, yeah 
Nobody can find, yeah, nobody can find, yeah
