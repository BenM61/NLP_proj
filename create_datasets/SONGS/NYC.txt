White house on the beach
My steps down to the sand
The plane takes off and we
We are just when it lands

Waiting in a room
Where the windows won't open
Got coffee with no mud
And my heart still ain't broken
Still ain't broken
Still ain't broken

And the music stops
And the beat goes on
And the music stops
But I'm dancing on

I won't be home until I've walked
Every street in New York
And I'll walk on without your love
Without your love
Dancing on til I'm alone
There's no need to return
Without your love, until I have walked
Every street in New York

Boat goes
From one island to the next
An old man drinkin' beer
Women on the bench

And the music stops
And the beat goes on
And the music stops
But I'm dancing on

I won't be home until I've walked
Every street in New York
And I'll walk on without your love
Without your love
Dancing on til I'm alone
There's no need to return
Without your love, until I have walked
Every street in New York

Glory when my plane takes off
Don't know me when I'm home
Say your prayers with your fingers crossed
Forget to call fore I go

If I had to phone tonight
To say I made you sad
And though I've fallen in your call and palm

I won't be home until I've walked
Every street in New York
And I'll walk on without your love
Without your love
Dancing on til I'm alone
There's no need to return
Without your love, until I have walked
Every street in New York
