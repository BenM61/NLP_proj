A room without windows, a room without doors
A room where no guy but I can spy the charms that are yours
Like being marooned on a island far from civilized shores
You and me in a room without windows, a room without doors

No bells will be ringing, no telephone calls
In our little well-secluded cell of ceiling and walls
While dozens of males sit 'n' chew their nails and hate me because
I am yours in a room without windows, a room without doors

 If they said "Friend, how would you like to spend the long hereafter?"
 I'd tell them what we're after is a one-way ticket to

A room without keyholes, a room with no view
We'd like to reside there, hide there for an era or two
Completely wrapped up in each other while the whole world ignores
You and me in a room without windows, a room without doors
