Waste, oh oh
Waste, oh oh
'Cause time is slipping away
Someone wait, oh oh
Save your soul
'Cause time is slipping away so fast
Time is slipping away so fast

So paint your pictures in your mind
In your mind
It's alright
We dance in circles 'til we're tired
Then we'll rise forever

Oh, don't you know forever
Never lasts
Never lasts
Oh, don't you know forever
Never lasts
Never lasts

Time slipping, time slipping, slipping
Time slipping, time, time slipping
Time slipping, time slipping, slipping

So paint your pictures in your mind
In your mind
It's alright
We dance in circles 'til we're tired
Then we'll rise forever

Oh, don't you know forever
Never lasts
Never lasts
Oh, don't you know forever
Never lasts
Never lasts

Waste, oh oh
Waste, oh oh
