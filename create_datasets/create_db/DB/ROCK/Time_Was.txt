I've got to rearrange my life,
I've got to rearrange my world.
I miss you, I need you.

I've got to keep my memories aside,
I've got to try to live again.

Time was when there were things around
To be afraid of.
I've got cause, I've even changed my mind
To turn the tables.

Time was when there was no need to stop
And rearrange it.
Now I've got a memory
And I don't want to change it.

And there's a time for waking up
And feeling down,
It's when you have to pick your feet
Up from the ground.

Time was when I had you around -
I was a strong man.
I need you to help make the change
And be a new man.

Takes more than a day and a night
For giving.
It's not so easy just to change your way
Of living.

Time was when there were things around
To bother me.
The crime was, I couldn't start
To change my history.
