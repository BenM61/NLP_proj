Why veil the sun?
Why darken the water?
'Thy will be done' if you think you ought to.

No one can see you when you're on your own.
No one can be you.
Take your time don't hurry;
It's alright don't worry!

You've just begun for to awaken.
Do walk, don't run!
You're not forsaken.

No one can free you from your own prison.
No one can see you
Take your time, don't hurry!
It's alright, don't worry!

It's alright, don't worry!

No one can free you from your own prison.
No one can see you
Take your time, don't hurry!
It's alright, don't worry!
