Flocks of geese in Paris skies
They come to me with open eyes
Dreaming of her and other lives
To pass the time waiting for Mara. 

And I alone beside her sit
There's just a lonely candle lit
It casts a glowing over it, Mara. 

Green is ember blue is gold
A not so different story told
Please take my arms
They're growing cold, Mara. 

Green and silver, they're off to the moon
I've lost my way ? she's lost hers too
Now that I love what shall I do
To pass the time waiting for Mara. 

And I alone beside her sit
There's just a lonely candle lit
It casts a glowing over it, Mara. 

Green is ember blue is gold
A not so different story told
Please take my arms
They're growing cold, Mara. 

I alone beside her sit
There's just a lonely candle lit
It casts a glowing over it, Mara. 

I alone beside her sit
Beautiful
There's just a lonely candle lit
Beautiful
It casts a glowing over it, Mara.
