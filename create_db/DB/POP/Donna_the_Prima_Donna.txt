(Donna, Donna the Prima Donna
Donna, Donna the Prima Donna
Donna, Donna the Prima Donna
Donna, Donna the Prima Donna
Donna, Donna the Prima Donna)

Broke my heart
We're apart
Thinks she's smart

I met a girl a month ago
I thought that she would love me so
But in time I realized
She had a pair of roving eyes

I remember the nights we dated
Always acting sophisticated
Talking about high society
Oh then she tried to make a fool out of me

(They call her Donna, Donna the Prima Donna)
Broke my heart now
Thinks she's smart now
We're apart now

Pretty little girl you're just having fun
You're running all around and breaking lover's hearts
Pretty little girl, I don't stand a chance
Without any money there goes our romance

She always wears charms, diamonds, pearls galore
She buys them at the five and ten cents store
She wants to be just like Zsa Zsa Gabor
Even though she's the girl next door

(They call her Donna, Donna the Prima Donna)
Broke my heart
Thinks she's smart
We're apart

Pretty little girl you're just having fun
You're running all around, you're breaking lover's hearts
Pretty little girl, I don't stand a chance
Without any money there goes our romance

She always wears charms, diamonds, pearls galore
She buys them at the five and ten cents store
She wants to be just like Zsa Zsa Gabor
Even though she's Donna next door, oh

(Donna, Donna the Prima Donna
Donna, Donna the Prima Donna
Donna, Donna the Prima Donna
Donna, Donna the Prima Donna
Donna, Donna the Prima Donna
Donna, Donna the Prima Donna
Donna, Donna the Prima Donna)
