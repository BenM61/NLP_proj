my head fits
into my hands
I roll it around
and nothing comes out
by chance, we fight
by chance, struck a chord
we'll stand tonight
who broke who
who screamed who
there's no two things
lovers can do
by chance, we fight
by chance, struck a chord
we'll stand tonight
who's your tall friend?
he's built like a song
the valley of Tin Pan *
is where he belongs
by chance, we fight
by chance, struck a chord
we'll stand tonight
bye-bye-bye-bye-bye
