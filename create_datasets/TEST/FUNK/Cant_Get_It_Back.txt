It don't get no better than this come on 
Blaque is back again 
Salaam hit 'em 

Gave you my love and I can't get it back 
Gave you all of my time and I can't get it back 
Now the ring that you gave me 
You can't have it back 
'Cause this shit's not going down like that 

Gave you my time and I can't get it back 
Gave you all my love and I can't get it back 
Now the things that you gave me 
You want them back 
But this shit's not going down like that 

Verse one when we begun 
You know you have a sista on sprung 
When we hung 
'Cause a brotha was nice with his tongue 
As we played every day 
You always knew, just what to say 
As we laid and planned to go to Paris the very next May 
As time moved on, we were torn 
You used to love me from dusk 'till dawn 
Now you trippin' from night till morn (wha what, wha what) 
You changed your song 
And you can no longer keep me warm 
'Cause the loving we shared was gone (bye bye) 

'Cause you better know 
That you can't get it back 
What you put in this relationship 
I'm telling you so 
'Cause I can't get it back 
All my kissing and loving and hugging 
So I'm telling you 

Gave you my love and I can't get it back 
Gave you all of my time and I can't get it back 
Now the ring that you gave me 
You can't have it back 
'Cause this shit's not going down like that 

Gave you my time and I can't get it back 
Gave you all my love and I can't get it back 
Now the things that you gave me 
You want them back 
But this shit's not going down like that 

Come On 
Verse two, now we're through 
Up, out my life and aw
