You're going to take what you can get
A hammered Styrofoam
Beat into the west
Live the highway in your home
You're going to get what you deserve
And not a penny less
Concrete the natural absurd
Only killers call killing progress

Fall on me black helicopter
You're all I see

You're going to take what you can get
Food aid rock and roll
Absolution for your head
For Xbox, Cointelpro

You're going to get what you deserve
And not a bullet less
Hey Sammy, ain't you heard?
Only killers call killing progress

Fall on me black helicopter
You're all I see
