Although you see the world
Different from me,
Sometimes I can touch upon
The wonders that you see.
All the new colors
And pictures you've designed.

Oh, yes sweet darling,
So glad you are a child of mine,
Child of mine,
Child of mine,
Oh, yes sweet darling,
So glad you are a child of mine.

You don't need directions,
You know which way to go
And I don't want to hold you back,
I just want to watch you grow.
You're the one who taught me
You don't have to look behind.

Oh, yes sweet darling,
So glad you are a child of mine,
Child of mine,
Child of mine,
Oh, yes sweet darling,
So glad you are a child of mine.

Nobody's gonna kill your dreams
Or tell you how to live your life.
There'll always be people to make it hard for a while
But you'll change their heads when they see you smile.

The times you were born in
May not have been the best,
But you can make the times to come
Better than the rest,
I know you will be honest
If you can't always be kind,

Oh, yes sweet darling,
So glad you are a child of mine,
Child of mine,
Child of mine,
Oh, yes sweet darling,
So glad you are a child of mine.

Oh, yes sweet darling,
So glad you are a child of mine,
Child of mine,
Child of mine,
Oh, yes sweet darling,
So glad you are a child of mine.
