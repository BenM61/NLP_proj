Yesterday I was
Half the man I used to be
Oh, maybe that's because
You're the other half of me
Like the spring in bloom
The summer of our love is soon
Every bird will sing
The melody of our love tune

Send down from above
Unconditionally love
Likened to a flower
Stronger love grows by the hour
Stormy weather days
Make us go our separate ways
Where our love was so at ease
Now you got me down on my knees

Yesterday I was
Brighter than the morning sun
Now my love is lost
And lonely days have just begun
A solitary chair
For a silent love affair
A king lost his throne
And now he sits alone
