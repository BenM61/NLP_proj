I heard the news today
Billy's gone away
Left us all for good
No one understood

You only had to say
I would understand
You only had to say
Whatever come what may

I was feeling low
You called and you were too
We'd meet Saturday
It happened on Wednesday

You only had to say, it's sad
I would understand
You only had to say
Whatever come what may

I don't want you brave
A truce we made today
If you're feeling sad
On me you can depend

You only have to say, it's sad
I would understand
You only have to say, it's sad
Whatever come what may

You only had to say
I would understand
Don't be scared to say
Whatever come what may

You only have to say
You only have to say
