I ain't nothin,' but seventeen years old 
Want to fulfill my dream have a million records sold 
But niggas hatin on me everyday and that's cold 
I keep my four-four and I ain't gon' let it go 
My money can't fold no more it's in stacks 
My nose is close now I see that ain't where it's at 
My hoes done elevated I'm on another level 
My wrist done elevated to rolex with the bezel 
I'm young but bout nice things off top 
Don't f*ck wit' what I worked hard for cause I'll hit yo' block 
I ride in big bodies 
I sleep in big beds 
Always wear boks (reeboks) and bauds always gon' bust a head 
I'm a well-known lil' nigga 
On my cell phone talkin' bout six figures 
You get yo' dome bust on in a split second 
'Cause I'm gonna keep my rep as a livin' legend, a livin legend 


What make niggas think they f*ck wit raps I spit 
What make 'em think they can touch beats from Fresh I get 
What make 'em think they can compete with this hot boy clique 
This haterism goin on and the world makin' me sick 
I'ma top notch baller all bout' my cheese 
I'm the one got yo' bitch and her girls talkin' bout me 
B.G. name rating like a Thompson fall 
Cruisin' in my truck on the lake bazookas crumpin', dog 
Fresh behind me in the burb twenties blind y'all 
Niggas that broke lookin for hustle so they ridin fall 
But I got my pistol for the busters got they eye on my gucci 
Man I refuse to let these jackers gain a stripe off lil' duga 
Since twelve I been thuggin keep a frog in my mouth 
I had a dream off top but this rap game no doubt 
Don't get mad you ask yo' boo who the man and she confesson 
'Dat 'Dat lil' nigga off VL is a living legend 


I know with my skills I'll rule the south 
Out bitch niggas mouth I'm sh-shoot about 
Niggas don't even know me want to leave BGeezy smellin' 
It ain't my fault my tape stopped yo' shit from selling 
I'm tellin' you f*ck wit' me you'll learn yo' lesson 
I'm tellin' you I'm all about dome checking 
I'm like the eclipse close yo' eye's I'll blind ya 
Quick to out shine ya 
Part of the Big Timer 
It ain't hard to find ya if I wan' kill ya 
Boy, you can't hide these big heads will reveal ya 
Me and my ch-chopper get near ya and spill ya 
Bustin' a head it's something I always will do 
I always get my chill on 
And when I smile sparkle wit' my grill on 
You get yo' dome bust on in a split second 
'Cause I'ma keep my rep as a livin' legend, livin' legend
