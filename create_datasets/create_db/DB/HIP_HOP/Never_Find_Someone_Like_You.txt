Girl you take my breath away
And when I'm with someone new
I'd rather be here with you
Baby, forever
My heart belongs to you
Cause I think about you all the time
I know my love is true
when we're together

I've played around girl and I made you cry
When I looked up, you were saying good-bye
I'm begging you please
I need you so bad
Don't leave me now, you're the best that I've had

[Chorus]
I've never, I'll never find someone like you
I promise it's true
No, I'll never, I'll never find someone like you
Girl I love the way that you are
Girl, I won't, no I won't let you go
No one could ever do, the way I would make love to you

All I have is just my heart
And my feelings, I give to you
That's all that I can do
Give you forever
Oh oh oh, you don't know that you're hurting me
Cause it's not just a sexual thang
I want to share my dreams, baby, together

Girl, I'm afraid just to give it up now
My heart's telling me to hold back on my vow
But when you get close, I just want you to know
I start to get weak & I can't let you go

[Chorus]

Just your smile, tenderness
Girl I won't let you down (Won't let you down)
Girl I will never find no one that compares to you
Never find anyone

[Chorus: x2]
