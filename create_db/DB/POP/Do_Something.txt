Oh, honey! Oh, honey! 
Why is it that you act so funny? 
When we should be making love? 
Oh, I'm willing, I'm so willing, 
But nothing that you do seems thrilling, 
I long for your pettin'; 
Where am I gettin'? 

There's the moon, way up high, 
Here are you, and here am I, 
Oh, do, do, do something! 

I ain't been hugged, and I ain't been kissed, 
And I want to see just what I've missed, 
So, oh do, oh do something! 

I got the time and the place, and the place and the time, I know, 
I got a bench and a park, and a park and a bench, and all. 

You know, other pairs, they're making haste, 
But look at me, I'm just going to waste, 
So, oh do, oh do something! 

Summer night, the stars are low, 
Oh, tell me, what are we waitin' for, huh? 
Oh, come on, honey, oh, come on, do something! 
Boop-boop-a-doop! 

You know, it's been told, and explained 
That nothing tried is nothing gained, 
So, won't you do something? 

Got a hug and a kiss and kiss and a hug or two, 
I want to give them away, and I'm gonna give them away, to you! 
Boop-boop-boop-a-doop! 

Sittin' around just seems so dumb, 
And look at me, I'm gettin' numb, 
So, won't you, oh, do something! 

All alone, just we two, 
And I feel so boop-boop-a-doo, 
So, oh do, do, do, do, do bup-a-dup-a-dup-a-dup, 
Boop-boop-a-doop!
