Here is somethin' baby, I want you to do
I ain't barrin' nobody baby, I mean you and your lyin' friends too
Don't cry baby, don't even spill a tear
Yes, you just pack your clothes baby,
Baby and get on outta here, get on outta here

Yeah, get on outta here
You and your friends you say you had fun,
You went every place woman, that you wanted to go
And when I tried to talk to you baby,
You didn't listen to a word I say
And now baby you must be crazier, that juice has gone to your head
Ain't no need of cryin' woman, baby, don't even spill a tear
You just pack your clothes baby,
I mean and get on outta here

I gave you a chance and that you know,
You got greedy and thirsty baby and you spent more and more
There's no need cryin' baby, don't even spill a tear,
You just pack your clothes baby, baby and get on outta here
