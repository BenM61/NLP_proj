Forward ever
Backward never
Stick together
And last forever

The race is not for the swift but
For those who endure
We've been tried and tested
And know the score

CHORUS

So pick up your bootstraps and backside
We moving forward no backslide
Wow now, wow now

Stop your fighting back away back biting
Let's unite now
Not dividing

These are things that I can't stand
Says we're acting like crabs in a can now
Nuff a fe we youth dem turn to
Drugs and crime
Come lets save the rest cause we are
Loosing time now

CHORUS

So pick up your bootstraps and backside
We moving forward no backslide

We moving forward
We moving forward Heh!
We moving forward no backslide
Wow now, Wow now

REBEL RAP

CHORUS
So pick up your bootstraps and backside
We moving forward no backslide

Are you ready for this message
Seize the time to be progressive
Take you stance now and be counted
It's now or never

Blessed are those who are struggling
In a JAH name
Iniquity workers bow their
Heads in shame yeh

CHORUS
So pick up your bootstraps and backside
We moving forward no backslide

We moving forward
We moving forward Heh
We moving forward no backslide
Wow now, Wow now
