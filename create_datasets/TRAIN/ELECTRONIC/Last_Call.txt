Last call
Bar hopping
We've gotten so far?

Bizarre the boys
We're not stopping
So close to the edge
We go underground

Ooohooohoooooooh

Go go dance her
You do whatever you like
Dance her
I just want your love

It won?t stop here
The decisions made
The only way out...
Is in

This is your medicine ha ha
Who sa bouche est bien rouge
If you go
I'll end up coming along

Go go dance her
You do whatever you like
Dance her
I just want your love
Go go dance her
You want whatever you know
Dance her
I just want your love...

Moi, I'm not some rocker chick
J'ai les pieds sur terre

I can understand
Who you want to be
But...
This is forever
I am so boheme!
