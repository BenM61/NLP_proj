Marco's shadow falls on the door
To the 7 lost cities of gold
Finds a raven's head and rattler's tail
Dead in his tracks, this godforsaken soul's
Unwanted here and his ghost lingers for years

Amalia's face hides behind the mask
Sweating on the TV factory line
That smile on her face is starting to crack
While welding back the pieces of shattered heart
That's scattered out here, with the ghosts of her peers
Searched for her lost love along the river of tears

At the end of the working week
When drunken worlds meet
Both sides keeping a close eye
For a break in the line here
On the crystal frontier

Blood spills out on the streets
And bodies are missing for weeks
Both sides keeping a close eye
Watching the bullets fly here
On the crystal frontier

Ramon tightens up his leather belt
And slips through a hole in the fence
He can get you anything you want
Might cost you a life, might cost you
The whole price of freedom here
On the crystal frontier
