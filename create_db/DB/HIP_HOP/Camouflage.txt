We act on animal instinct, survival of the primitive 
Invade your camp, then set up a perimeter 
Interrogate the prisoner, ransack your residence 
Order from the president to document this evidence 
Company Commander, this is my version of capitol punishment 
Scars from carvin' out shards of shrapnel 
Attackin' with passion, the movement of murder is intimate 
In hand to hand combat or atomic bombs that disintegrate 
Let me reiterate, in a state of neurosis 
A license to kill, plus an expert with explosives 
Assault forces, feel the shell shock 
Section 8 sounds great, give me your cell block 
As sure as hell's hot, I'd rather go there 
Crouch down, jungle fatigue, guerrilla warfare 
Armed watch, think about the bullets I've dodged 
Light a smoke an' post it up for the night in camouflage 

I make my face thick with paint stick 
Today's the dawn of the infected insects 
Bees, butterflies, beetles and panza dragons 
There's danger of Ganza Syndrome in my squadron 
We hate them all, that's why we made the 8 ball 
The milk and water tastes like typhoid and protocol 
Sleep deprivation, magic carpet bombin' ride 
I'm talkin' through my gas mask, walkin' down a thin red line
You're currently tuned in to N-B-C, 
The only channel that you'll get is from my M-16 
I lace my boots and place my troops 
I'm more terrified of mosquitoes than I am of the paratroops
I'm in the shit box, reading Alfred Hitchcock 
5 minutes later I'm bleedin' out my snot box 
I see the witch doc, he's says it's rice grains 
Dropped from airplanes, sprayed with anthrax 
Operation Peking, take the ground back 
It's found in brown rats, 
And in the toilet paper issued in your ruck sack 
Agent N, Agent X for the fade to black, 
Camouflage
