Do you remember what the draft-man said:
"Nothing to do all day but stay in bed"

You're in the army now
In the army now

You'll be the hero of the neighbourhood
Nobody knows that you left for good

In the army now
Smiling faces on the way to hell
But once you get there no one gives a damn

In the army now

Hand grenades flying over your head
Missiles flying over your head
If you want to survive, get out of bed

In the army now
Just ring out in the dead of the night
The sergeant called: "Stand up and fight!"

You're in the army now
In the army now

You get orders how to shoot on sight
Got the fingers on the trigger
But it don't seem right

You're in the army now
In the army now

Night is falling and you just can't see
Is this illusion or reality?

In the army now
Is this illusion or reality?
