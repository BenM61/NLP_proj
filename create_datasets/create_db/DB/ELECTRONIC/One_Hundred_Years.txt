It doesn't matter if we all die 
Ambition in the back of a black car 
In a high building there is so much to do 
Going home time 
A story on the radio 
Something small falls out of your mouth 
And we laugh 
A prayer for something better 
A prayer 
For something better 

Please love me 
Meet my mother 
But the fear takes hold 
Creeping up the stairs in the dark 

Waiting for the death blow 
Waiting for the death blow 
Waiting for the death blow 
Stroking your hair as the patriots are shot 
Fighting for freedom on the television 
Sharing the world with slaughtered pigs 
Have we got everything? 
She struggles to get away

The pain 
And the creeping feeling 
A little black haired girl 
Waiting for Saturday 
The death of her father pushing her 
Pushing her white face into the mirror 
Aching inside me 
And turn me round 
Just like the old days 
Just like the old days 
Just like the old days 
Just like the old days 

Caressing an old man 
And painting a lifeless face 
Just a piece of new meat in a clean room 
The soldiers close in under a yellow moon 
All shadows and deliverance 
Under a black flag 
A hundred years of blood 
Crimson 
The ribbon tightens round my throat 
I open my mouth 
And my head bursts open 
A sound like a tiger thrashing in the water 
Thrashing in the water 
Over and over 
We die one after the other 
Over and over 
We die one after the other 
One after the other 
One after the other 
One after the other 
One after the other 

It feels like a hundred years 
A hundred years 
A hundred years 
A hundred years 
A hundred years 
One hundred years
