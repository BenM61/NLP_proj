I guess I fell in love too quick
Kinda got burned up by a red head chick
So I ain't tryin' go that route again

I was rolling through a stop sign
Lookin' at a red light when I seen her ass walk by
That's when I found my new friend

And she had blonde hair, bright blue eyes
Looking like a flower child
Top down, music loud
Jamming to her favorite song

I'm down, she was down
So we really hit it off
And I know she could never do
Do to me what them red heads do

I'm scared that girl's a red head
I'm scared that girl's a red head
'Cause every time I go there
I see them red head girls just ain't no good

I'm scared that girl's a red head
I'm scared that girl's a red head
'Cause every time I go there
I see them red head girls just ain't no good

Got a girl whose a real knock out
Got me all turned out but I still have doubts
Why she gonna get her hair done again?
(She's gonna get her hair done again)

She did something kinda strange the other day
I was looking at a picture of her family
She came and snatched it away, it away

And I don't know why she would hide it
But I let it go
And there are certain things about her
That I still don't know

I'm scared that girl's a red head
I'm scared that girl's a red head
'Cause every time I go there
I see them red head girls just ain't no good

I'm scared that girl's a red head
I'm scared that girl's a red head
'Cause every time I go there
I see them red head girls just ain't no good

My girl walked in today
But there was something strange
I still recognized her face
But something else had changed

She had bright red hair
I just stopped and stared
Walked by me like she didn't care
That hair was always there

See I know I'ma be okay
I got rid of Miss Red today
Tryna cover up behind my back
But I knew that red would come right back

See I know I'ma be okay
I got rid of Miss Red today
Tryna cover up behind my back
But I knew that red would come right back

I'm scared that girl's a red head
I'm scared that girl's a red head
'Cause every time I go there
I see them red head girls just ain't no good

I'm scared that girl's a red head
I'm scared that girl's a red head
'Cause every time I go there
I see them red head girls just ain't no good

I'm scared that girl's a red head
I'm scared that girl's a red head
'Cause every time I go there
I see them red head girls just ain't no good

I'm scared that girl's a red head
I'm scared that girl's a red head
'Cause every time I go there
I see them red head girls just ain't no good
