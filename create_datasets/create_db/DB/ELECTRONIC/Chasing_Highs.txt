Two a.m., I'm fading in the dark
Like floating in the ocean
People need the poison
Three a.m., you just touched my hand
And made me lose my focus
I almost didn't notice

And I better know what to do
Who's gonna be the first one to move?
I wanna get closer to you
And I better know what to do
Who's gonna be the first one to move?
I wanna get closer to you

I was chasing highs
Then I found you
We're doing it in slow motion
We're doing it in slow motion
I was chasing highs
Then I found you
You are getting closer in slow motion

I'm chasing hi-hi-hi-highs
I'm chasing hi-hi-hi-hi-highs
I'm chasing hi-hi-hi-highs
You are getting closer in slow motion

Four a.m., almost touching you
Drowning out the noises
In between the voices
Five a.m., there is something more
I caught the luck you gave me
Phases groing hazy

And I better know what to do
Who's gonna be the first one to move?
I wanna get closer to you
And I better know what to do
Who's gonna be the first one to move?
I wanna get closer to you

I was chasing highs
Then I found you
We're doing it in slow motion
We're doing it in slow motion
I was chasing highs
Then I found you
You are getting closer in slow motion

I'm chasing hi-hi-hi-highs
I'm chasing hi-hi-hi-hi-highs
I'm chasing hi-hi-hi-highs
You are getting closer in slow motion

I stopped counting the hours
Space between us getting smaller and smaller
I'm losing the powers
I'm falling higher and higher with you

I was chasing highs
Then I found you
We're doing it in slow motion
We're doing it in slow motion
I was chasing highs
Then I found you
You are getting closer in slow motion

I'm chasing hi-hi-hi-highs (ooh yeah, ooh yeah)
I'm chasing hi-hi-hi-hi-highs (I'm chasing, I'm chasing)
I'm chasing hi-hi-hi-highs (ooh yeah, ooh yeah)
You are getting closer in slow motion
