Well they're building a gallows outside my cell
And I've got 25 minutes to go
And the whole town's waitin' just to hear me yell
I got 24 minutes to go
Well they gave me some beans for my last meal
With 23 minutes to go
But nobody asked me how I feel
I got 22 minutes to go
Well I sent for the governor and the whole dern bunch
With 21 minutes to go
And I sent for the mayor but he's out to lunch
I've got 20 more minutes to go
Then the sheriff said boy I gonna watch you die
With 19 minutes to go
So I laughed in his face and I spit in his eye
With 18 minutes to go
Now hear comes the preacher for to save my soul
With 13 minutes to go
And he's talking bout' burnin' but I'm so cold
12 more minutes to go
Well they're testin' the trap and it chills my spine
11 more minutes to go
And the trap and the rope aw they work just fine
10 more minutes to go
Well I'm waitin' for the pardon that'll set me free
With 9 more minutes to go
But this ain't the movies so forget about me
8 more minutes to go
With my feet on the trap and my head on the noose
5 more minutes to go
Won't somebody come and cut me loose
7 more minutes to go
I can see the mountains I can see the skies
With 3 more minutes to go
And it's to dern pretty for a man that don't want to die
2 more minutes to go
I can see the buzzards I can hear the crows
1 more minute to go
And now I'm swingin' and here I go!

Thank you very much. I'm going to do another song here,
Featuring the harmonica, eh
And then I want to get the stool there and sit down and do some, uh
Slow ballad type songs that we wanted to do for this album
And especially for you.
What I do with my list over there. My idiot sheet
Oh, hit the floor.
How ya doing Shirley?
