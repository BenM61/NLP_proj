Fear is the enemy of love
So don't be scared, we could lose it all
I'm here and I'm planning to stay
So don't let fear drive love away 

Sweet as a mother's song
In the still of the night
Oh my love will be there
I'll be there, it's alright, it's alright 

Time has a way of telling the truth
So be still, let time talk to you
See I, I can't make you believe
But I've never lied to you
I swear my heart is true 

Sweet as a mother's song
In the still of the night
Oh my love will be there
I'll be there, it's alright, it's alright 

Fear is the enemy of love
So don't be scared, we could lose it all
I'm here and I'm planning to stay
So don't let fear drive love away 

Sweet as a mother's song
In the still of the night
Oh my love will be there
I'll be there, it's alright, it's alright 

I said fear is the enemy of love...
