Running from the start and here we are again
Running from the start and here we go again
Smile in the smoke and find something to say
Smile in the smoke and find something to say
Who the hell are we to start this chain again?
Who the hell are you to break this chain again?
Trying to imagine giving it away

Why don't you stay? (La la la la la, la la la la la, la la la la la)
Why don't you stay? (La la la la la, la la la la la, la la la la la)
Why don't you stay? (La la la la la, la la la la la, la la la la la)
Why don't you stay?

Any chance that I could have something to drink?
Any chance that I could have something to drink?
Walking around here looking for something
I can get fucked up on absolutely anything
I'd sweep you off your feet when you will fall apart
I'd sweep you off the floor oh god you're drunk again
Find it in the light of somebody else's heart

Why don't you stay? (La la la la la, la la la la la, la la la la la)
Why don't you stay? (La la la la la, la la la la la, la la la la la)
Why don't you stay? 
Why don't you stay?

Looking at the stars, I have you to myself
Looking at the stars, I have you to myself
Standing here with you and thinking of someone else
Standing here with you and thinking of someone else
Blanket on my back, I'm cold, I'm cold again
Tryna see your eyes, oh, make me warm again
Smile in the snow and tryna find something to say

Why don't you stay? (La la la la la, la la la la la, la la la la la)
Why don't you stay? (La la la la la, la la la la la, la la la la la)
Why don't you stay?
