Well, I'm goin' up, up on Magic Mountain.
Well, I'm goin' so high, we're gonna touch the sky.
Drink a little water, up on Magic Mountain.
Peace and love, love, love, for you and I.

Yes, we're goin' high, high, high, high on Magic Mountain.
We're goin' high, high, high and never comin' down, no, no.
Yes, we're goin' high, high, high, high on Magic Mountain.
We're goin' high, high, high and never comin' down, no, no.

Walk in the sun, up on Magic Mountain,
Red mountain wine, everybody laughs.
When the day is done, up on Magic Mountain,
Feeling fine, fine, fine, rollin' in the grass.

Yes, we're goin' high, high, high, high on Magic Mountain.
We're goin' high, high, high and never comin' down, no, no.
We're goin' high, high, high, high on Magic Mountain.
We're goin' high, high, high and never comin' down, no, no.

See the clouds floatin' past,
Just like our troubles, it's a thing of the past.
Poor people way down below,
That's one place I never let you go.

You'll be my baby, we will never come down,
Be my queen, you can wear that crown,
Visit my kingdom, it belongs to all,
Stay up here, and we can fall, fall, fall, fall.

We're goin' high, high, high, high on Magic Mountain.
We're goin' high, high, high and never comin' down, no, no. (Ooo)
We're goin' high, high, high, high on Magic Mountain. Yes.
We're goin' high, high, high and never comin' down, no, no.

I like it up here, up on this mountain.
I said lord no, no, I ain't never comin' down, no, no. (Ooo)
Just you and me baby, up on this mountain. Yes.
We're goin' high, high, high and never, never, never comin' down. (Ooo)

Just you and me baby, up on this mountain,
Oh lord, no. Ow! Never comin' down, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh people, walk around this mountain, no, no, baby, no,
Hand-in-hand, baby, never comin' down, no, no. (Ooo)

Let me make love to you, right on this mountain,
Lord! People! I ain't never, never, never comin' down.
I love you baby, up on this mountain. Ow!
Forget about tomorrow, Lord, I ain't never comin' down, no, no.
The time is now, up on this mountain.
