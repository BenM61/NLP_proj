Shut off to the world outside
In order to look in
Caught up in a battle
This is where I've been

Accepting negativity
Not listening to truth
I must return to lighter ways
That I knew as a youth

I used to move to
Create change
Realized and rearranged
Believing in myself I'd see

My dreams into reality
All my life
I felt confusion
Black and white

The colors of my
Illusion
Turned on to the world outside
To free myself within

Overcome this battle
Heeding love again
Since I want to feel then
I know I have to live

Got to move to create change
Realize and rearrange
Believing in myself I'll see
My dreams into reality

From the light
The color fusion
It's what works right
Do you feel my

Allusion
Illusion
Got to move to create change
Realize and rearrange

Believing in myself 
I'll see my dreams into reality
All my life
I felt confusion

Black and white
The colors of my
Illusion illusion illusion illusion illusion
