oh yeah baby
you aint gonna worry me baby
someday baby you aint gonna worry me no more
next time you leave im gonna change the locks on the door
you think you got something baby, aint nobody got but you.
you think you got something baby, aint nobody got but you.
you better think it over
when the lord made one, he sure made two

i believe in that old saying
treat me like i treat you
i believe in that old saying
treat me like i treat you
if i treat you nice and kind
treat me the same way too

dont get that feeling 
that no one can take your place

if you ever get that feeling 
your going to be replaced.
