(Verse 1)
I know Boo Boo I mean 50 he a grimey nigga
50 shot my brother I'm a find that nigga
We don't see his punk ass unless he on TV
Yeah he did my brother dirty but he don't wanna see me
Member Rydell from KP thought he was his man
Put him on the table to bag up he beat him for grams
How you think he got that money for that Chalk Gray Land
That nigga robbin and stealin everything that he can

Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear niggaz runnin they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear hoes runnin they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me

(Verse 2)
Yeah I know Curtis, he used to f*ck with my friend
Used to come through my projects pick her up in the Benz
Niggaz from my buildin always used to ask about him
Like she in and out of town right that niggaz get down right
I used to say, all I know, is the nigga get money
And you standin in my way, excuse me dummy
Ronda she told me that nigga a freak
And McDonald's ain't the only thing that he eat

Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear niggaz runnin they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear everybody runnin they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me

(Verse 3)
I love 50 Cent, that's my dad
But even my mom talk about him bad
She says since he blew up, he changed for sure
He's really fascinated with these fancy hoes
I don't know why but there personalities collide
And my dad will swallow blood before he swallows his pride
You know the kids in my class they be sayin he's crazy
They just like him cause he rollin with Dr. Dre and Shady

Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear niggaz runnin they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear niggaz runnin they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me

(Verse 4)
Man 50 fucked up, I mean real fucked up
He left us in the hood we fucked up
Still actin like he in the street tellin niggaz they can't eat
You know this motherfucker went and bought Tyson's crib
Got Bentley's, Ferrari's, and all that shit
He don't even come through to try and help niggaz out
That's the bullshit see what I'm talkin about

Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear niggaz runnin they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear everybody runnin they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me

(Verse 5)
That's my Grand baby I love him I raised that boy right
He ran to me cryin sent him back out to fight
Put a battery in his sock go pick up a rock
You ain't a chump, you want your Grandma to think you a punk
Look at my first Grand baby, he is a big rap star
Bought me a house, diamonds, and a brand new car
I tought him what it takes, to go this far
Boy I'm the reason you are what you are

Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear niggaz runnin they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear everybody runnin they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear everybody runnin they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me
