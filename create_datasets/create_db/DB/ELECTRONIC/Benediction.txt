Hey!
Feel it coming on
I waited for so long!
Feel it come my way
Each and every day
By the time I put on my shoes
Already have the groove
Benediction in the morning time
Everybody riding on

On and on, keep on riding
On and on, keep on riding
On and on, keep on riding
On and on, keep on riding on

Feel it coming on
I waited for so long!
Feel it come my way, yeah
Each and every day
'Cause it's nothing that I can do
Feeling true!
Benediction in the morning time
Everybody riding

On and on, keep on riding
On and on, keep on riding
On and on, keep on riding
On and on, keep on riding
On and on, keep on riding
On and on, keep on riding
On and on, keep on riding
On and on, keep on riding on

I feel like our love has found a home
Feel like my love, feel like my love has found a home
In this place I know that I belong!
Feel like my love, feel like my love has found a home
I feel like my love has found the hole
Feel like my love, feel like my love has found a home
Benediction in my mind, benediction in my heart and soul!
Benediction in my mind, benediction in my heart and soul!

I feel like my love has found the hole
Feel like my love, feel like my love has found a home
In this place I know that I belong!
Feel like my love, feel like my love has found a home
I feel like my love has found a home
Feel like my love, feel like my love has found a home
Benediction in my mind, benediction in my heart and soul!
I feel like my love has found a home
Feel like my love, feel like my love has found a home
In this place I know that I belong!
Feel like my love, feel like my love has found a home
I feel like our love has found a home
Feel like my love, feel like my love has found a home
Benediction in my mind, benediction in my heart and soul!
Feel like my love, feel like my love has found a home
Benediction in my mind, benediction in my heart and soul!
Feel like my love, feel like my love has found a home
