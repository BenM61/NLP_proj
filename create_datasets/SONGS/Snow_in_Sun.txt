Correspondence or coherence
I am calling, I am calling you

I was getting me down
Took a train into town
And the sun was shining brightly
Though the snow was falling lightly too

Made me think of how brave you are
And how come I have strayed so far
And why everything came apart
In my head and heart now, love

You will never be without me
You will never need to doubt me
There'll be something good about me soon

Like sun in the city of snow
Like snow in the city of sun

I was watching you sleep
I've been watching you dream
Should we be beset with trouble
I would never let you come to harm

Looks like maybe we'll lose our home
Out of pocket and all alone
I should have worked and I should have known
Seen the dark clouds coming in

But you will never be without me
I'm beside you, never doubt me
There'll be something good about me soon

Like sun in the London snow
Like snow in the London sun

Undetermined, inessential
I am calling, I am calling you

You
You
You
You
