I eat a mango and I'm feeling like a little honey can roll
Star fruit so simple and I'm feeling like a little honey can roll
How could I feel so so when I'm feeling like a little honey can roll
Tart but not total and I'm feeling like a little honey can roll

When I was young I thought fruit was an infinite thing
I'd be sad to wake up and find all of my cherries are charred or they're rotted to ruin

It seems we all can't last
Oh pink lady your days so distinguished are a movement so fluid
So smooth against my palm
Reminisce of the days when they all praised your sweet red delicious

When a farmer picks a good thing (when you think you don't know you don't know what comes next)
Then a kid he picks a good thing (When you think you don't know you don't know what comes next)
Then a chef she makes a good thing (When you think you don't know you don't know what comes next)
Then a mayor eats a good thing (When you think you don't know you don't know what comes next)

Ripe and whole we can move outside us 
Ripe and whole we can move outside us 

Take for me take for me pictures of valleys with lemons hung
Dangling dangling they will be released every little piece does make a one
Brown on the ground can you show me a way I can simplify
Comfort me comfort me after the battles and sleepless nights

I'm just a rush
Rush to blow upon the fire
You're just a rush
Rush to blow open my mind

I eat a mango and I'm feeling like a little honey can roll
Star fruit so simple and I'm feeling like a little honey can roll
How could I feel so so when I'm feeling like a little honey can roll
Tart but not total and I'm feeling like a little honey can roll

When I want fruit I can find it wherever I please
What if I should wake up and find dudes on the street waiting in lines or scrounging for berries?

I'm losing things so fast
One day maybe I'll have a cool kid with a granny but I don't have a pose for applesauce on clothes
Reminisce of the days when my mom made it all seem delicious

I'm just a rush
Rush to blow upon the fire
You're just a rush
Rush to blow open my mind

Why should I rush, rush to blow upon the fire
Why do I rush, rush to blow upon the fire

One the eagle
Two the Nobel
Three the lizard
Four the sole
