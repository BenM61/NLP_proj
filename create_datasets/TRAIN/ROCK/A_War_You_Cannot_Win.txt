We've been deceived for so long, we stop believing 
Can't tell what's right or what's wrong 
So you stop feeling 
when violence, and coercion are their tool 
Then you must stand scream 
 
No, hell no, won't follow commands I won't meet 
your demands said 
No, hell no I am not yours to rule 
I won't be your fool, 'cause 
 
We are standing here waiting you'll listen to reason 
This is a war you cannot win 
We are standing he waiting
And you're going to listen 
This is a war you cannot win 
 
Now I can see that it's all a fight for power
But there is no way we are wrong this is our hour 
One voice can silence the masses 
One voice just scream these words say 
 
No, hell no
Won't follow commands I won't meet 
your demands said 
No, hell no
I am not yours to rule I won't be 
your fool cause 
 
We are standing here waiting you'll listen to reason 
This is a war you cannot win 
We are standing he waiting
And you're going to listen 
This is a war you cannot win 
 
Just take a good look around you now 
You have to see there's no way 
You can't control what we feel, what we think 
And we will not go away
 
No, hell no
Won't follow commands I won't meet 
your demands said 
No, hell no
I am not yours to rule I won't be 
your fool cause 
 
We are standing here waiting you'll listen to reason 
This is a war you cannot win 
We are standing he waiting
And you're going to listen 
This is a war you cannot win 
 
Won't follow commands I won't meet your demands 
(War you cannot win) 
We are standing here waiting 
Won't follow commands I won't meet your demands 
(This is a war you cannot win)
