High, high

Music never stops
Makes me
High

Like the feeling
That you're feeling
When you're stoned to the bone

Don't get played out
Never fade out
'Cause you stayed out
All night long

Stayed out all night long

Gotta have it
Gotta habit
There's a monkey on your back

In the valley of the dolls
Groovin' danceamaniacs

High, high

Music never stops
Makes me
High, high

Take it to the top
Let's get high
On a trip
The natural tip
I don't need no kinda' drugs

Sip with care
But don't be scared
You can never get too much
(Never get too much)

Gimme music, we can use it
There's no turning back for us
All for one, here's to freedom
In groove we trust

High, high

Music never stops
Makes me
High, high

Take it to the top
Let's get

High, high

Music never stops
Makes me high, high

Take it to the top

Let's get

High
Music never stops
Makes me
High, high

Take it to the top

Let's get

Music never stops
Makes me

Take it to the top
Let's get

High, high

Music never stops
Makes me
High, high

Take it to the top
Let's get

High,High

Music never stops
Makes me
High, high

Take it to the top
Let's get

High, high

Music never stops
Makes me
High, high
