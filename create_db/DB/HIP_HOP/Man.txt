Man you think you cool you accomplished a lot
Even put a man on the moon astronaut
Even put the rocket up can't know how you pulled that off
Master your faith captain of your soul knock it off
Ya you gave us Shakespeare Mark Twain and the Odyssey
Socrates philosophy the Iliad was hopping
Even built the great wall of China and the Golden Gate Bridge see
Even took your first flight wright brothers 1903
Taj Mahal Petronas Towers Pyramids see Eiffel Tower
World wide cuisine anything to deli anna
Enchiladas Sushi Chicken Masala
Simply put man we blessed
Hope you read me homie printing press
One day blasting off Apollo 11
Can't pay for your sin and won't get you in heaven
