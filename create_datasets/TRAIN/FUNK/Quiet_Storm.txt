Soft and warm, a quiet storm
Quiet as when flowers talk at break of dawn, break of dawn
A power source of tender force
Generatin', radiatin', turnin' me on, turnin' me on

Oh, you short circuit all my nerves
Promising electric pains
You touch me and suddenly there's rainbow rings

Quiet storm blowing
Through my life, oh
Quiet storm blowing
Through my life, oh blow, baby

Oh, when you sigh, we can ride
A butterfly caught up in a hurricane, hurricane
Lucky me, I'm glad I'm free
Suddenly I'm caught up in your summer rain

oh, shower me with your sweet love
I will bathe in every drop
Through all the seasons 
Let it pour and never stop

Quiet storm blowing
Through my life, through my life
You're just like a quiet storm blowing
Through my life, through my life, through my life
through my life, through my life

Blowin', blowin', blowin', blowin'
Ah, through my life
Oh

Hail soft storms of loving me
Let them play on my desires
Kiss me softly
Let your lightenin' light my fire

Quiet storm blowing
Through my life, through my life
You're just like a quiet storm blowing (blowing, blowing)
Through my life, through my life

Quiet storm blowing
Through my life
Quiet storm blowing (Oh, yeah)
Through my life

Oh

Shower me with your sweet love
I will bathe in ever drop
Through all the seasons
Let it pour and never stop

Quiet storm blowing
Through my life, through my life
You're just like a quiet storm (blowing)
Warm and tender, through my life (oh through my life)

Quiet storm, you're blowing
Through my life, through my life, through my life
Quiet storm blowing
Through my life

Blow, baby
Blow, baby
Blow, baby
Blow, baby

Oh yeah, quiet storm
yeah, quiet storm
Blow, baby
Blow, baby
Blow, baby
