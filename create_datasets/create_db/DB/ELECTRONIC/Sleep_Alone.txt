Now, my only goal is to see
And I'm always fast asleep
It takes more than strength to find
This peace of mind

So I'll hold, hold, hold
Hold it close to my heart
Beating with every step
Hold, hold, hold it close

He sleeps alone
He needs no army where he's headed
'Cause he knows
That they're just ghosts
And they can't hurt him if he can't see them, oh
And I may go
To places I have never been to
Just to find
The deepest desires in my mind

We, we only know what we see
'Cause we're always fast asleep
Is it so hard not to believe
That we'll never know

Oh, hold, hold, hold
Hold me close
I've never been this far from home
Hold, hold, hold me close
He sleeps alone
He needs no army where he's headed
'Cause he knows
That they're just ghosts
And they can't hurt him if he can't see them, oh
And I may go
To places I have never been to
Just to find
The deepest desires in my mind

They're in my head
And I have said
That I must be like you now
Who sleeps alone
Who sleeps alone
And one last chance
To make sense
Of what has long escaped us
He sleeps alone
I sleep alone

He sleeps alone
He needs no army where he's headed
'Cause he knows
That they're just ghosts
And they can't hurt him if he can't see them, oh
And I don't know if in the morning I will be here
And if so
Let it be known
That I was worthy, I was worthy, I was worthy, I was
Oh
Oh
