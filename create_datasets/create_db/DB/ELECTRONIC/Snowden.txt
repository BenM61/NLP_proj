I say man, can you help me out,
Bring back to love,
Bring me back to life,
Oh why should I care.

I said how, could you keep me out,
Without a wish to share,
So without a doubt,
Oh why should I care.

We have been warned,
Its a classic sign,
Its a wicked mind,
With an axe to grind,
Oh when is it our, our time,
Oh so why should we care,
Again,again,again.

Again,we have been warned, this a classic sign.
Why should we care.

If this is all, that summer,
Oh why should we care,
Woah if this would be our, summer
Then why should we care.
