While I'm far away from you my baby
I know it's hard for you my baby
Because it's hard for me my baby
And the darkest hour is just before dawn

Each night before you go to bed my baby
Whisper a little prayer for me my baby
And tell all the stars above
This is dedicated to the one I love

Love can never be exactly like we want it to be
I could be satisfied knowing you love me
(And there's one thing I want you to do
Especially for me)
And it's something that everybody needs
