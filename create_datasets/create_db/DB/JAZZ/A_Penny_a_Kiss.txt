I'm gonna save a penny
Every time I hold you tight
And we're gonna watch
The pennies grow.

I'm gonna save a penny
Every time we kiss goodnight.
And honey when we're married
We can own a bungalow.

A penny a kiss.
A penny a hug.
We're gonna save our pennies
In a little round jug.

A penny a kiss.
A penny a hug.
Ohhhh,
How rich we're gonna be.

A penny a kiss.
A penny a hug.
We're gonna save our pennies
In a little round jug.

A penny a kiss.
A penny a hug.
Oh how rich we're gonna
Oh how rich we're gonna
Oh how rich we're gonna be.
