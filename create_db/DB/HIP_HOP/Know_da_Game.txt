(Mobb Deep) 
Shit is real on the muthafucking hill  God 
Times is hard  visons blurred kid  I can't see far 
Thinking will I be the next nigga deceased 
Over some bullshit beef I pack heat 
Son it's '96 and I ain't going out like that 
Never roll a dollo 'cause my crew got my back 
And it's a fact  niggas don't know how to act 
Till I cop back  react  leave 'em laying on they back 
Sometime I try to maintain and chill 
Stop my brain from thinking, restrain from grabbing my steal 
I'm stressed out, trying to live right on the wrong route 
Thinking of ways to get loot in large amounts 
So I chill on the block, nigga respect mines 
?A giver wit the nets? and the muthafucking tech nines 
So pack steel if you come through, front if you want to 
Before you do, so let me warn you 
We more infamous, crime shit, take it to the gat 
F*ck the rhyme shit, you reminded of what the nine did 
Remanded, QBC, then left stranded 
We cock cannons, punishing and back handing 
Chorus(2x) 
(M.O.P) 
In order to survive the game 
Know the game 
Hold your name 
And let them niggas know 
The way to win the war 
Attend the war 
End the war 
And let your hammer go 
(Kool G. Rap) 
Yo, I'll leave your whole body twisted when you get lifted 
And police'll have to fist rumblistics on a bisket, another statistic 
I try to chill but you insisted coming all in my district 
I don't know why the f*ck you risk it 
I be more deep, walking the streets, packing the heat 
Bring the cowmeat, you'll lifted off your feet and leave you sleeping 
on 
the concrete 
Get blown at home or whatever is on your bone 
Get to flown to your dome, blow chromosones out your flesh and bones 
Hitman for hire, who's the next one to expire 
Shoot it up in black attire, hit you wit the rapid fire 
The stainless bisket will leave your brain smoking 
Your whole frame broken and clothes soaken, head blown the f*ck open 
Try to step inside of fort and get caught 
Wit the trey pound shorter left on the sidewalks of New York 
The decompose, blood flows are holes in your clothes, eyes closed 
Body be frozed, posing for pictures with a rose 
Head to your toes, look like you got wetted with a hose 
The road you choose got your brain drain through your nose, nigga 
So who be committing crimes, dangerous minds, put two to your spine 
Lay you behind enemy lines 
When we cross it and leave you like a broken faucet 
The underworld production family can reinforce it 
(Mobb Deep) 
Yo, when shit get real, it ain't what you expected 
Me and kikos are known to get hectic 
Only to wreck shit, many slugs in all directions 
Make you see the light when my shot makes connections 
Niggas get their face split in section 
Shooked, using ice grilled looks for they protection 
?We saw? everything you fear 
And indulging in crime-filled atmosphere 
This shit ain't nuttin' new, it's only things that we used to 
We used to stick niggas on the F through to 
The E train, when it's time to recruit 
I humble on the D train, see my man D, Don't need to purchase my 
cocaine 
Word to my newborn seed 
A nigga gotta make loot to support greed 
On the wildside of the fence, the shit is on the verge of explosion 
It's so cold, you might get frozen 
If you leave yourself vulnerable and time lasping 
Fools collasping and caught up in gun clapping 
No matter who you are if you know many faces 
I don't discriminate, my shot bleed all races 
And coaches, we sorts like vultures 
Eating your insides like ulcers and pour niggas closer nigga 
Chorus
