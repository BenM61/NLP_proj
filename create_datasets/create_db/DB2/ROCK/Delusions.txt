I've become one with the universe (Incomprehensible)
I'm controlling the power of cosmos
Hoping to drive in space, space
Acid in space

It takes me to another dimension
Relieving from reality
Living in a world of delusions
These drugs keep me sane

The world will discover
It's not all me exposing the life that you breath
Feeling lighter is all I (Incomprehensible)
Reflecting the truth to delusions and dreams

Lost in my empty feelings
It's better there, pronounce me dead
Promise I'd live like fire in the sun
I can't see through the cloud that surrounds me

Painted pictures are not like the way you think
By having the answers in my eyes
In my mind, in my soul
I'm losing control, the sky keeps falling on me

Exposing the life that you breath
Reflecting the truth to delusions and dreams
Feeling lighter is about like the heavenly seed
Why is this happening to me?

Never trusted by my inner feeling
It's better to be dead than to be alive

Painted pictures are not like the way you think
By having the answers in my eyes
In my mind, in my soul
I'm losing control the sky keeps falling on me

Exposing the life that you breath
Reflecting the truth to delusions and dreams
Feeling lighter is about like the heavenly seed
Why is this happening to me?
