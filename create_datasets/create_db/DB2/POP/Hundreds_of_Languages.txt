The spirit rose, above a hundred languages
And the moon was there for all to see
And the beat goes on across a 100 languages
And the sun is the same, yeah, one and the same for you and me
They had many words with the same meaning
And one voice with which they sang

In Hundreds of Languages speak to me
In Hundreds of Languages speak to me

But its all been said about a hundred times before
But it's only words, it's only words
They had stories, that spanned the generations
Handed from one to one on down the line

I hear a voice and it seems to speak to everyone
I hear a voice and it's callin' me

In Hundreds of Languages speak to me
In Hundreds of Languages speak to me

Speak to me
