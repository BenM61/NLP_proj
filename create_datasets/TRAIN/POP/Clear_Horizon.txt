Look around, it's almost summer
Yet there's winter in her heart
You could never love another
Still, can your fire melt her ice
Can your fire melt her ice
 
Seasons change, you cry in silence
For the love you cannot live without
You've done your best, you tried your hardest
The time has come, be strong, give it up
 
All you need is a clear horizon,
A clear horizon
All we wish is everyday,
Hope and pray,
For all of us
A clear and quiet sky
 
The darkest night is slowly fading
And the sun will come out to blind your eyes
Could it be a new beginning?
Trust yourself - you're an angel, you can fly
Trust yourself - you're an angel, you can
 
All we need is a clear horizon
