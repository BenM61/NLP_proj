Baby did a bad bad thing  
Baby did a bad bad thing
Baby did a bad bad thing 
Baby did a bad bad thing

You ever love someone so much you thought your little heart was gonna break in two?
I didn't think so
You ever tried with all your heart and soul to get you lover back to you?
I want to hope so
You ever pray with all your heart and soul just to watch her walk away?

Baby did a bad bad thing
Baby did a bad bad thing
Baby did a bad bad thing
Feel like crying
Feel like crying

You ever toss and turn your lying awake and thinking about the one you love?
I don't think so
You ever close your eyes your making believe your holding the one your dreaming of?
Well if you say so
I hurts so bad when you finally know just how low, low, low, low, low, she'll go

Baby did a bad bad thing
Baby did a bad bad thing
Baby did a bad bad thing
Feel like crying
I feel like crying

Oh feel like crying
Feel like crying
Oh, feel like crying
Feel like crying
