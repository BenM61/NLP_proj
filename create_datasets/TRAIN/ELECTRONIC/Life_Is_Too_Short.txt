Life is too short, don't stress everyday
Leave your worries behind go out and play
Life is too short, grasp it in your hand
A natural miracle, have fun while you can

Life is too short, as precious as gold
It's full of surprises, so I am told
Life is too short take it from me
Have as much fun as you wish, just wait and see

Life is too short, people seem to forget
That life is a gift and its free yes that's it
Life is too short, use your own eyes
Open yourself and enjoy your own life
