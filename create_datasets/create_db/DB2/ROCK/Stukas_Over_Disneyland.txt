Mickey's on the production line
I'm a super mouse in time
Everybody's doing the goose step out in anaheim

Mastermouse gonna feel no fear
Mickey's gonna lead us to the new frontier
Everybody wants to be the perfect mouseketeer

And there's stukas over disneyland
Stukas over disneyland
Stukas over disneyland
Stukas over disneyland

Jiminy cricket wrote a victory speech
With nottsberry farm right in reach
Our liebestraum has been extended to huntington beach

Turn on the gas and you're gonna see
How to achieve racial harmony
We need a perfect order that's our genetic destiny

Got an ss ticket I'm feeling fine
Spent five long hours just standing in line
Passed inspection got my ears on straight
Gonna fire up my engines 'fore it gets too late
I just can't wait
