You can ride high atop your pony
I know you won't fall
'Cause the whole thing's phoney.
You can fly swinging from your trapeze
Scaring all the people
But you'll never scare me

Bella Donna
And we fight for the northern star

No speed limit this is the fast lane
It's just the way that it is here
And you say I never thought it could

Bella Donna we fight
For the northern star

And the lady's feeling
Like the moon that she loved
Don't you know that the stars are
A part of us
And the lady's feeling
Just like the moon that she loved

And you say I never thought it could
Bella Donna
Come in out of the darkness

You are in love with
And I'm ready to sail
It's just a feeling
Sort of captures your soul

Bella Donna

And the woman may be awestruck
And the woman may truly care
But the woman is so tired
So the woman disappears

Come in out of the darkness

Bella Donna my soul

Don't change baby please don't change
And you say
And your face becomes thin
You never thought it could
Come in out of the darkness
Bella Donna

You are in love with
And I'm ready to sail
It's just a feeling
