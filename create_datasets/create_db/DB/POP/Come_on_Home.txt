Baby come home, I miss the sound of the door
Your step on the stair's not there to wake me no more
And every day's like Christmas Day without you
It's cold and there's nothing to do
And it's mighty quiet here now that you're gone
I've been behaving myself for too long
'Cause I don't like sleeping
Or watching TV on my own
So please come on home
Baby, what's keeping you all this time
You're wasting your days out there in the sunshine
And who can I turn to if you believe still
That England don't love you and she never will
For it's mighty quiet here now that you're gone
And I've been behaving myself for too long
I don't like drinking
Or painting the town on my own
So please come on home
Baby come on home please
For it's mighty quiet here now that you're gone
And I've been behaving myself for too long
'Cause I don't like sleeping
Or watching TV on my own
So please come on home
