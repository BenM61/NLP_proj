Thinking of tomorrow
With the sunset in your eyes
I feel everything and sorrow
So I have to say goodbye

Didn't think that we would love like this
I never thought that I would care
Slowly now I read the writing
It can free us if we dare

If there is
New love
New ways
New changes in our lives
Those times will last forever

If there is
New love
New ways
New changes in our lives
Those times will last forever
And ever

Didn't think that we could love like this
I never thought that I would care
Slowly now I read the writing
It will free us if we dare

If there is
New love
New ways
New faces in our lives
Those times will last forever

If there are
New loves
New ways
New faces in our lives
Those times will last forever
And ever
