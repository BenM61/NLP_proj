Laugh and sing, be happy 
It's the thing, be happy, 
Wink your eye, then fix your tie 
Be as I, be happy! 

Fall in line, be happy, 
Waste no time, be happy 
Time won't wait, why hesitate 
Call it fate, be happy! 

When the guy called trouble 
Throws you for a loss 
Heads or tails, win or lose 
Show him that you're still the boss... 

Start today, be happy 
Why delay, he happy 
Don't you to try to alibi 
Be as I, be happy! 

Why delay, he happy 
Start today, be happy 
Don't you try to alibi 
Be happy!
