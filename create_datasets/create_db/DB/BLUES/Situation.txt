People fight for the basic right to choose
To live a life we don't intend to lose, 
The time has come when we must all decide
To end our evil ways or let the whole world slide

Who would of thought
That wars were fought to free our nation 
We must make the changes
From the basic situation
Ooh yeah yeah

Listen people
It's all right
When you've fought on foreign soil.
Not your very own
'Cause you don't want it destroyed
We are keepin' our own identity
We must look around
For ideas to be real
So many of the people have been justified.
We must face the truth
'Cause there ain't no real place to hide.

Listen people
If it's true that no one really cares
We've got to sacrifice through the changing years
Do the things we feel no matter most of all
So let the people yeah
Sweet music is our home
Please realize happiness is your conviction
You'll find in people all kinds of good reaction
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
