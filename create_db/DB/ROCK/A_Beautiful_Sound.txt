It's a beautiful sound

The heart of a proud man breaking
The cry of a sinner seeking truth
The beat that your heart is making
The moment that true love crashes through

It's a beautiful sound
When the walls come crashing down
And the chains fall to the ground

And the song we sing
Is the song of valley deep
Of the lost tomorrow found
It's a beautiful sound

The hope that a dreamer whispers
The life in the laughter of a child
The silence that all inspires
In the shadow of love that's strong and wild
It's a beautiful sound

It's a beautiful sound
When the walls come crashing down
And the chains fall to the ground

And the song we sing
Is the song of valley deep
Of the lost tomorrow found
It's a beautiful sound

And it's a beautiful sound
When the walls come crashing down
And the chains fall to the ground

And the song we sing
Is a song of valley deep
Of the lost tomorrow found

And it's a beautiful sound
It's a beautiful sound
It's a beautiful sound

To let freedom reign
In the hearts of valley deep
Of the lost tomorrow found
Yeah, it's a beautiful sound

The heart of a proud man breaking
The moment for true love crashes through
It's a beautiful sound
