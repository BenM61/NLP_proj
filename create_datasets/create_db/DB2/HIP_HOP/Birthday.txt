Had a birthday yesterday, she cried.
Took off her glasses, let her hair down, and sighed.
She told them all at work, about her day.
How is it no one came? Woe, woe.

Took the invitations to her friends;
They were too busy, doing other things.
Told them all at work, about her day.
How is it no one came? Woe, woe.

She took the decorations from the wall.
It was the ladder loose, that made her fall.
She told them all at work, about her day.
How is it no one came? Woe, woe.
