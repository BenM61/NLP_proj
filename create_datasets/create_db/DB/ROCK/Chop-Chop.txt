Take a walk to the new town, take a look around 
Pretty road names pass us by, a foundation sound 
They paint their walls and ceilings white to feel clean inside 
Ten square miles so synchronized I could have cried 

And the bodies go by barely half awake 
Awaiting things to come again, nice things to come 
It's such a nice environment I'm in 
I wonder why I'm here and the bodies go by barely half awake. 

All but the few ever notice anything at all, Oh dear 
All but the few ever notice anything at all. 

I've got a nice new wristwatch with a bright red strap 
The second hand really moves quite fast - I'd never thought of that 
And then I pick my picture book to compensate outside 
It's back to fiction once again, I could have cried. 

And the bodies go by barely half awake 
Awaiting things to come again, nice things to come 
It's such a nice environment I'm in 
I wonder why I'm here and the bodies go by barely half awake. 

All but the few ever notice anything at all, Oh dear 
All but the few ever notice anything at all
