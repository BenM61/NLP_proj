I'm comin' up so you better get this party started
I'm comin' up so you better get this party started

Get this party started on a Saturday night
Everybody is waiting for me to arrive
Sendin' out the message to all of my friends
We'll be looking flashy in my Mercedes Benz

I'm comin' up so you better get this party started
I'm comin' up so you better get this party started

Pull up to the bumper get out of the car
License plate says, stunner number one superstar

I'm comin' up so you better get this party started
I'm comin' up so you better get this party started

Making my connection as I enter the room
Everybody is chilling as I set up the groove
Pumping up the volume with this brand new beat
Everybody is dancing and they're dancing for me
I'm your operator you can call anytime
I'll be your connection to the party line

I'm comin' up so you better get this party started
I'm comin' up so you better get this party started
