Now ain't that more like it? Oh, that is so nice.
I think I'm about at the peak of my erotic.
Drawers shakin', bodies flowin'. I know that's right.

All of the women, it's a pandemonium.
Lots of burnin' drawers in here, gotta get me some.
Let me make up my mind, I gotta pick me one.
Here's another comin' now, it's a mass hysteria.

Wild chaotic, peak of my erotic. There's a riot goin' on.
People manic, dancin' in a panic. We call it pandemonium.
We call it pandemonium.

We call it pandemonium.
This place is out of control from all the excitement.
... Hey Morris?
Yes?
... Cool us down.
Naw, I don't like Eskimos.

I like'em hot with firecracker shakes, a body build that flows.
So gigolos like me can work the dance floor.
Oh, shake it now.
... Go, Morris!
That's right. You wouldn't happen to have some liniment, would you?
Turn around. - Shake.
Lemme look at you. - Shake.
Shake it. - Shake.

Wild chaotic, peak of my erotic. There's a riot goin' on.

We call it pandemonium.
