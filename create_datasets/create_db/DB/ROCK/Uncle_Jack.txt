Are you ready for suicide? 
Let me run a razor across your throat 
You took a child for a ride 
Led them down a long and shameful road 
It rips my heart out to see you livin' 
You gave them money in exchange for pain 
You're the monster in the closet 
They'll take your secrets with them to their graves 

Locked you away behind cast iron doors 
Rather see you dead on the floor 
I hope that you're feeling so much pain now 

Uncle Jack 
Can you hear them still screamin'? 
Broken hearts, broken dreams 
Uncle Jack 
Is your evil still creepin'? 
Never comin' back here again 
What were you thinkin', are you human? 
Took their innocence and made them slaves 
You want forgiveness, you're so sorry 
I'd rather put you in an unmarked grave 

Locked you away behind cast iron doors 
Rather see you dead on the floor 
I hope that you're feeling so much pain now 

Uncle Jack 
Can't you see them still bleedin'? 
Broken hearts, broken dreams 
Uncle Jack 
Tell me how are you sleepin' 
Never comin' back here again 

Uncle Jack 
Can't you hear them still screamin'? 
Broken hearts, broken dreams 
Uncle Jack 
Is your evil still creepin'? 

Why? Tell me why
