We're gonna wake this city tonight
Oh, watch it burn into the twilight
I said hey, hey, hey this is our birthright
To be bought and sold, shipped off ready to die. We're ready to fight.

We're going bom bom bom. Bom bom away bom.
Bom bom, bom bom.
We go bom bom, bom bom away bom. Bom bom, bom bom.

I can't drink or drive a tank at nineteen
So I set off to join the U.S. Army
The first time I left my country
I felt the desert sand marchin' under my feet. Come march with me.

We're going bom bom bom. Bom bom away bom.
Bom bom, bom bom.
We go bom bom, bom bom away bom. Bom bom, bom bom.

We're gonna take this city tonight
We're gonna shake this city 'til broad daylight
We're gonna take this city tonight
We're gonna shake this city 'til broad daylight
Shake it. Oh shake it.

I said: No NYC, Los Angeles
No Saint Louis, no New Orleans
No you and me, no you and me, no sympathy
Cause we're gonna bring them, bring them to their knees

We go bom bom bom, bom bom away bom. Bom bom, bom bom.
We go bom bom, bom bom away bom. Bom bom, bom bom.

We're gonna take this city tonight
We're gonna shake this city 'til broad daylight
We're gonna take this city tonight
We're gonna shake this city 'til broad daylight
Shake it. No brights lights, no more big city.
Shake it. No brights lights, no more big city.
Shake it. No brights lights, no more big city.
Shake it. No brights lights, no more big city.
