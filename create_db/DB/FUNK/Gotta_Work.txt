[Chorus]
Sometimes it's gonna be days like this
Sometimes it's gonna be rain like this
Sometimes you're gonna feel pain like this
Sometimes you gotta work hard for it

Because when you feeling low
And you can't get no lower
That's when you know your close
Sometimes you gotta work hard for it

Woke up in the morning
It's another cloudy day
But that never mattered too much to me
'Cause it's still a new beginning
And I know I got it in me
Had my share of ups and downs
But now I know I can do anything

Some people think I'm aggressive
'Cause I know what I want
But that never mattered too much to me

Show me some body with no goal
Show me some body with no control
'Cause life is for living
So go and get it
When times get rough remember

[Chorus]

Because when you feeling low
And you can't get no lower
That's when you know your close
Sometimes you gotta work hard for it

Ohh gotta get it
Hey hey hey
Sometimes the road may seem too far
You never really know for sure

If you're ever gonna make it
Sometimes the end may seem so far
You never really know for sure
If you got the strength to make it

But you gotta remember

[Chorus]

Because when you feeling low
And you can't get no lower
That's when you know your close
Sometimes you gotta work hard for it

Days like this
Rain like this

Do it 'cause I love it
Feel like this
Gotta work hard for it
