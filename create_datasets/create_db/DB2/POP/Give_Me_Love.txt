All I know is I am broken
And I fall sometimes
All I know is my heart is stolen
And I can't escape sometimes

Another home, another lover
Another home
Am I alone, where's my mother?
Where'd she go?

Feels like these years go so fast
Bluebirds find a home at last, take me home take me
Baby, baby, ooh they got me
Give me love, give me love
Baby, baby, wooo, they shot me
Give me love, give me love - ooh, ooh

Go ahead wash your hands off me
I won't come back this time
You said you'd throw me out
So beat it, hang me out to dry

Another home, another lover
Another home
Am I alone, where's my mother?
Where'd she go?

Feels like these years go so fast
Bluebirds find a home at last, take me home take me
Baby, baby, ooh they got me
Give me love, give me love
Baby, baby, wooo, they shot me
Give me love, give me love - ooh, ooh

Feels like these years go so fast
Bluebirds, please give me love
Give me love, give me love
Feels like these years go so fast
Bluebirds give me love that lasts
Give me love, give me love
Give me love, give me love
Give me love, give me love
Give me love, give me love
Give me love, give me love

Baby, baby, wooo, they got me
Give me love, give me love
Baby, baby, wooo, they shot me
Give me love, give me love
Baby, baby
Give me love, give me love
Baby, baby
Give me love, give me love
Baby, baby
Give me love, give me love
Baby, baby, wooo, they shot me
