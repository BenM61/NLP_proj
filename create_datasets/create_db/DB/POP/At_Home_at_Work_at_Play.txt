At Home, At Work, At Play
I know you're unavailable from dusk to dawn
Or if you were availible you'd bring along
A lot of what could only be a hindrance to me
I ain't a glutton for a lot of sweaty company
You gotta catch her while she's still at home
You gotta catch her while she's still at work
You gotta catch her while she's still at play
The only way is at home, work or play

Time really flies when it ain't that much time
You better shave half your face at a time
And brush the front of your teeth, leave the rest
And be with her when she's not with the rest
Stop, there's gotta be a million girls like her, though
I can't think of one
So you catch her while she's still at home
And you catch her while she's still at work
And you catch her while she's still at play

Don't let her calendar be any cause to pout
There is a bit of time when there are a few about
I'm gonna skirt the issue of her popularity
And just avail myself of all the time that she is free
You gotta catch her while she's still at home
You gotta catch her while she's still at work
You gotta catch her while she's still at play
Cause half the day she's at home, work or play

And time is fleeing the scene of the crime
The act of passing out wrinkles and lines
To every person regardless of race
To every person regardless of face
Stop, there's gotta be a million girls like her, though
I can't think of one
So at home she says you butler well
And at work she says you're typing well
And at play she says you caddie well

Stop,
There's gotta be a million girls like her, though I can't think of one
So you catch her while she's still at home
And you catch her while she's still at work
And you catch her while she's still at play

I'm gonna love you under incandescent light
I'm gonna love you under flourscent light
The glaring sun above should not inhibit us at all
I'm very glad to know that your libido never palls

Stop, she's unique, espscially at home
Where you're butler, maid, and often cook
And at work together juggling books
Or at play between the tennis sets
Or at play before she's placed her bet
Or at play while she's still slightly wet
Or at play while she is dripping wet
