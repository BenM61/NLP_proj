Baby if you look up
Whenever you're down
I will hear you calling out
Before you make a sound
We can climb this mountainside
We can cross the sea
'Cause all I am is you
And ail you are is me

Wherever you are
I am with you
'Cause we wish on the same star
'Cause I can feel you
It you are near or far
'Cause we wish on the same star

I would give my hand but
You would need my heart
I could give it to you
Before we fell apart
I would give my all you'd see
But only if I knew
That all you are is me
And all I am is you.

Wherever you are
I am with you
'Cause we wish on the same star
'Cause I can feel you
It you are near or far
'Cause we wish on the same star

On the same star

Hey! Hey!

Sometimes a caged bird sings
When a free bird flies away
In the waterfall of stars
You're calling out my name
We can climb this mountainside
We can cross the sea
'Cause all I am is you
And all you are is me

Hey! Hey!
