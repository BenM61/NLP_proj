You're a holiday
A glass of ocean slipping down my throat
And landed on my hopes, I'm dreaming
Off the maps no hidden grids, I'm fleeing
I worship you like holy days
Lying on my back, seeing clouds and rays
Drinking lime and bitter from my lemonade
White horses, maritime won't do

Do you remember?
The holiday slipped away
Time and place
I definitely remember
Lying on my back and seeing clouds and rays
We're dreaming
The feelings rule
Forever we're young
Pages unsung, ooh
I feel that you remember
Dreaming of a past that couldn't last
But now we're changing
Refraining

I'm thinking it's the, know that it's the
I'm thinking it's the bad, bad blood
I'm thinking it's the, know that it's the
I'm thinking it's the bad, bad 
Blood

Oh

Do you remember?
The riding, the passion, the falling over
And tripping on ice
Sharing advice, taking it twice
But let us not forget the
Silent day, stripped away
Time and place
Oh, you choose not to remember
Fly away, counting days
I'm hiding from you, ooh

I'm thinking it's the, know that it's the
I'm thinking it's the bad, bad blood
I'm thinking it's the, know that it's the
I'm thinking it's the bad, bad blood

I choose
For the rain not to fall
Exposing the sun on you
I lose
Don't tell me I'm cuckoo, I know
And it's mad, we were close, oh
I choose
My head's now afloat
But my heart's drowning pulse of you
I lose
Don't tell me I'm coo-coo
Coo-coo-coo-coo-coo-coo-ooh-ooh

I'm thinking it's the, know that it's the
I'm thinking it's the bad, bad blood
I'm thinking it's the, know that it's the
I'm thinking it's the bad, bad blood
I'm thinking it's the, know that it's the
I'm thinking it's the bad, bad blood
I'm thinking it's the, know that it's the
I'm thinking it's the bad, bad
