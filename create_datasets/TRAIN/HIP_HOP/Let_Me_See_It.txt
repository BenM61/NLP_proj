Let me see it, let me see it
Let me see it, let me see it
Let me see it, let me see it
Let me see it, bend over and let me see it

Let me see it, let me see it
Let me see it, let me see it
Let me see it, let me see it
Bend over and let me see it

Now, from the city that I live in
To the city where I'm from
For all the hoes that we done did
And the hoes that we ain't done

From the ones that f*ck for shrimp
To the ones that f*ck for cum
If you ain't fittin' ta f*ck, pimp
Then you ain't fittin' ta f*ck, Bun

Hoes from the 'hood
That live to keep it live
And some office buildin' boppers
Workin' 9 to 5

Ball, playa, baby, mama bitches
But to me it ain't no thang
Let that monkey hang
Baby, let me see it

See it, see it, let me see it
Let me see it, see it, see it
Let me see it, see it, see it
Bend over, see it, see it

Let me see it, see it, see it
Let me see it, see it, see it
Let me see it, see it, see it
Bend over, see it, see it

Let me see it, see it, see it
Let me see it, see it, see it
Let me see it, see it, see it
Bend over, see it, see it

Let me see it, see it, see it
Let me see it, see it, see it
Let me see it, see it, see it
Bend over, see it, see it

Go'on and let a nigga peak
And let a nigga poke
Go'on get nigga from his street
And let a nigga see it

Go'on and let a nigga peak
And let a nigga poke
Go'on get nigga from his street
And let a nigga see it

Go'on and let a nigga peak
And let a nigga poke
Go'on get nigga from his street
And let a nigga stroke

See, I know that you a freak
From passin' to my folk
Let me bust it in yo' cheek
You muthafuckin' choke

It's nothin' but a G thang
Baby, when you suck it
Steady frontin' in yo' G string
Go'on lemme f*ck it

See, we know that you a pro
From shakin' and tuckin'
'Coz we some grown muthafuckas
Like to get naked, buck it

From the back, to the front
And to the side
In the 'lac, wit' a blunt
Now, where the light?

It's a fact I've seen it
Lemme get in between it
Now, over bend, once again
Bitches, show it like ya mean it

Let me see it, let me see it
Let me see it, see it, see it
Let me see it, see it, see it
Bend over, see it, see it

Let me see it, see it, see it
Let me see it, see it, see it
Let me see it, see it, see it
Bend over, see it, see it

Take it off, bitch, bend over, lemme see it
I'm sweet James Jones
And a trick I couldn't be it, got a
Take it off, bitch, bend over, lemme see it

I'm sweet James Jones
And a trick I couldn't
Take it off, bitch, bend over, lemme see it
I'm sweet James Jones
And a trick I couldn't be it

Yo' a young brown stallion
And she 20 years old
When she pop it from the back
You see that hairy asshole
From the A-T-L hoes, to the H town strippers

To the boppers in Deville
Suckin' us and pullin' zippers
Now, it how it make you feel
When you see a pimp shine?
Bitch, you wastin' too much time
Get back up on yo' grind

Let me see it, let me see it
Let me see it, see it, see it
Let me see it, see it, see it
Bend over, see it, see it

Let me see it, see it, see it
Let me see it, see it, see it
Let me see it, see it, see it
Bend over, see it, see it

Let me see it, see it, see it
Let me see it, see it, see it
Let me see it, see it, see it
Bend over, see it, see it

Let me see it, see it, see it
Let me see it, see it, see it
Let me see it, see it, see it
Bend over, see it, see it

I'm a country ass nigga
I fucked wit' yo' wife
If yo' bitch come around
We put some dick in her life
Niggas ain't real, must'a started smokin' rocks
It all fell down, 'cause they was bitin' too much pac

But what goes up, must come down
While these bitches suckin' dick
And droppin' to the ground
But what goes up, must come down
While these bitches suckin' dick
And droppin' to the ground
But what goes up, must come down
While these bitches suckin' dick
And droppin' to the ground

City, every town, I'm ballin' in the mix
I'm servin' niggas bricks
Keep a bad yellow bitch
On my team, sippin' lean

Ain't no thang of the past
The '84 Beritz with the slant back ass
Keepin' me a pro, next to my fo'
Instead of stackin' cheese
He steady screamin' to that hoe, let me see it

F*ck ass nigga, f*ck ass nigga
Get yo' mind on yo' money
Hol' up, hol' up, UGK bitch
Representin' that south, that south
And this ain't no muthafuckin' Hip-Hop records
These country rap tunes, hol' up
