Love it's a really big word
But haven't you heard
It's dangerous

And you
You think you got it locked down
And figured out
And buttoned up 

But I
I been burned enough
So I leaned enough
To watch my back

That's why
I'm warning you
What you're about to do
Is deadly as

Dancin' on the devils stove
Playing with the fire below
Pushin' your luck
Dippin' your toe, in the water

It's a pedal down to race the train
Chasing down the hurricane
A bullet in a spinnin' revolver

Well the heart 
It's a fragile thing
Hangin' on a string
It don't take much
And a soul
It's a little bit strong
It takes a little longer 
To use it up

But when
It all comes down
'Cause it's gonna come down
You're gonna look around and wonder
How you got to where you're standing Right now

Dancin on the devils stove
Playing with the fire below
Pushin' your luck
Dippin' your toe, in the water

It's a pedal down to race the train
Chasing down the hurricane
A bullet in a spinnin' revolver

Dancin' on the devils stove
Playing with the fire below
Pushin' your luck
Dippin' your toe in the water

It's a pedal down to race the train
Chasing down a hurricane
A bullet in a spinnin' revolver

A pedal down to race the train
Chasing down a hurricane
A bullet in a spinnin' revolver
