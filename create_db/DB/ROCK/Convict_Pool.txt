Convict pool, in the land of salvation
Is where you find this masterpiece
Of a right-wing kidney punch

Escape, convict pool, escape

Executions are nearly flawless
So riding forever in the deep
Or taking it into the shallow
Is not a problem

Escape, convict pool, escape
Convict pool, escape

Check the underwriter killers
For video surveillance of the convict pool
In the warden son's private collection

Escape, convict pool, escape
Social fool, we evade

I forget to mention
That the coping of this baby's like butter
So stand up and grind far

Escape, convict pool, escape
Parental fools, we evade

Tony and George, avoid the nipple
Protrusion on the wall
With a backside hurricane
Over the death box, we fall

And escape, convict pool
Escape, social tool
Evade, courtroom duel
Escape
