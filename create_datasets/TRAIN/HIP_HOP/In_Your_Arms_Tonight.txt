I just want to have a good time (yeah,hmm)
(It's all about having a good time)
In your arms tonight yeah
(Just sit back and relax) 
If you feel my body
(And try to imagine how I feel)
La la la la la la la la
(When we're together)
It will free your mind yeah

Listen
The sun is setting
But I still see the twinkle 
In your eyes baby
The temperature's 80
Can you feel it feel it feel it feel it oh
I cannot be modest
When there's so much that's in store
And I've got it
And it's all for your body
(huh)
You ready? (yeah)

(Bridge)
Let's ride tonight
And forget what we've ever known
There are no promises
And nothing is set in stone
So let's take this moment slow
Cause we don't know how long we gon' live so
Close your eyes and lets go

I just want to have a good time
In your arms tonight yeah
If you feel my body 
La la la la la la la la 
It will free your mind yeah

From where we're standin'
There is no summer
That don't matter we're jammin'
Love's got us tannin'
Can you feel it feel it feel it feel it oh
My heart's at it's hottest
Body temperature's so hot
Nothin' can drop it
And it's all for your body
Huh (you ready?)

(Bridge)

I just want to have a good time
In your arms tonight yeah
If you feel my body 
La la la la la la la la 
It will free your mind yeah

You may not see this time again
I've endured so much joy and pain
Today there was no rain
So we enjoy it just because
You should just open up
My treasure chest and see this love

Yeah
Just sit back and relax
And try to have a good time nine and slow

I just want to have a good time
In your arms tonight yeah
If you feel my body 
La la la la la la la la 
It will free your mind yeah

It will free your mind
It will free your mind
(yeah) 

I just want to have a good time
In your arms tonight yeah
If you feel my body 
La la la la la la la la 
It will free your mind yeah
