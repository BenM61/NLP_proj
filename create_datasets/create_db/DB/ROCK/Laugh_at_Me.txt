Why can I be like any guy
Why do they try and make me run
Son of a gun
Now what do they care
About the clothes I wear
Why get their kicks from making fun
Yeah this world's got a lot of space
And if they don't like my face
It ain't me that's going any where, no

So I don't care
Then laugh at me
If that's fair
I have to beg to be free
Then baby laugh at me
And I'll cry for you
And I'll pray for you
And I'll do all the things
That the man up stairs says to do
I'll do them for you
I'll do them
I'll do them all for you

It's gotta start some place
It's gotta start some how
I'll make that other cheek mine
And maybe the next guy
That don't wear a silk tie
And he can walk by and say hi
Say hi, instead of why
Instead of why
Instead of why, baby
Instead of why
What did I do to you
