Babe, I don't want it all (Just a little)
I just want a little bit
I don't want it all (Just a little bit)
I just want a little bit

Just a little teeny bit, just an eeny-weeny bit of your love

Turn your lamp down low (Just a little)
Baby, I love you so
Turn your lamp down low (Just a little bit)
Baby, I love you so
Just a little teeny bit, just an eeny-weeny bit of your love

Could be a spoonful of coffee
Could be a spoonful of gold
Just a little spoonful of your precious love satisfies my soul

I don't want it all (Just a little, just a little bit)
I just want a little bit
I don't want it all (Just a little, just a little bit)
I just want a little bit
Just a little teeny bit, just an eeny-weeny bit
Just a little teeny bit, just an eeny-weeny bit
Just a little teeny bit, eeny-weeny bit of your love
Woo Woo Wooooo

Babe, I don't want it all

You know it could be a spoonful of coffee
Could be a spoonful of gold
Just a little spoonful of your precious love satisfies my soul

Babe, I don't want it all (Just a little)
I just want a little bit (Just a little bit)
I don't want it all (Just a little bit)
I just want a little bit (A little bit)

Just a little teeny bit, just an eeny-weeny bit

Just a little teeny bit, eeny-weeny b
