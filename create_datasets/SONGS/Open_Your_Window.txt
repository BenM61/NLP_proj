Open your window and take a deep sigh
Think about letting the rest of the world go fly a kite
Takin' it easy is easy as pie
And holdin' your hand is such a natural high

You sent flowers, we spent hours
We can be happy alone in a tent
Think of the money we'd save on rent

You sent flowers, we spent hours
We can be happy alone in a tent
Just think of the money we'd save on rent

If you just open your window and take a deep sigh
And holdin' your hand is such a natural high
