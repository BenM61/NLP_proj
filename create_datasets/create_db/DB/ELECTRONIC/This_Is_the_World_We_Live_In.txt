Somebody's felt her hate, 
He's faith is all about the certain 
Too busy thinking bout the pain 
To bother checking why it's hurting 

So come on make it right tonight 
Gotta get in my life 
Doesn't matter who you are 
When you moving up with Alcazar 

This is the world we live in 
And these are the hands we're given 
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in

This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in

Well you're moving up with Alcazar 
(Moving, moving, moving) 
Well you're moving up with Alcazar 
(Moving, moving, moving) 

Like a circle made of flames 
No telling where it started burning 
Oh for every fire you contain 
A new one keeps the circle turning

So come on make it right tonight 
Gotta get in my life 
Doesn't matter who you are 
When you moving out with Alcazar 

This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in 
(Where we live in) 

This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying 
(Let's start trying) 
To make it a place worth living in 

Moving 
Moving, moving, moving 
Moving, moving 
Move, move, move, move, move 

Doesn't matter who you are 
When you're moving up with Alcazar 

This is the world we live in 
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying 
To make it a place worth living in 

This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given 
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in 
(No matter how's beginning) 

Well you're moving up with Alcazar 
(Moving, moving, moving) 
Well you're moving up with Alcazar 
Well you're moving up with Alcazar!
