Good lookin' out little homie
Glad that you showed me
Just what he was all about

Good lookin' out little shorty
Guess she wasn't for me
Glad that I found all this out

Good lookin' out
See this is what I'm talkin' about
'Cause we both play the game
Never gonna change, all I gotta say is
Good lookin' out

I remember in the beginning boy I was so sure
I thought I found the one and my search was over
In your case I should of judged a book by its cover,
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Somethin' told me from the get-go you was the wrong dude
What looks good ain't always the best for you
But I'm cool I'm glad I'm seeing the real you (aaaaah)
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Now see, I thought about it
I had to flip the script and think about you

Well there's no doubt about, you know I can't deny it
I feel the same, too

Good lookin' out little homie
Glad that you showed me
Just what he was all about

Good lookin' out little shorty
Guess she wasn't for me

'Cause we both play the game
Never gonna change, all I gotta say is
Good lookin' out

I know you ain't gon' sit here and try to play crazy
Like everything was my fault, girl that's bologna
Don't point the finger at me we both do wrong, see
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Maybe we both better off being just friends now
I guess it took all of this to figure this out
There was a big lesson learned and that is no doubt (aaaaah)
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Now see I thought about it
I had to flip the script and think about you

And there's no doubt about it, you know I can't deny it
I feel the same, too

Ain't trippin' on you, ain't trippin' on you, ain't trippin' on you
Oh boy, oh boy, I'm cool, I'm cool on you, I'm cool on you
No girl, no girl, I'm cool
