If heaven watches over me,
Sowing seeds back in the soil.
With eyes that see, hands that feel,
Why am I the last to know?
Sheltered lives, spent partially breathing,
Are gathered together, under new religion.
Pulling punches, sleeping on our feet,
Pulling punches, I need someone to comfort me.
Raised in summer day of splendor,
Who would've dreamed of love never ending?
A better world lies in front of me;
A sketch of life in the books I read.
Then as I walk where heaven leads,
Why I am the last to know?
Simple lives, spent partially breathing,
Are gathered together, under new religion.
Pulling punches, sleeping on our feet,
Pulling punches, I needed someone to comfort me.
Raised in summer day of splendor,
Who would've dreamed of love never ending?
Nature feeds this nausea,
Deep inside the heart of me.
Sheltered lives, spent partially breathing,
Are gathered together, under new religion.
Pulling punches, (moving) sleeping on our feet,
Pulling punches, I needed someone to comfort me.
Raised in summer day of splendor,
Who would've dreamed of love never ending?
