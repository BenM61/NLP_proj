Work through joy through work the goddess of religion dogma and guilt
Poor me start joyful destiny, respite guilt free passion
Grant fear of freedom sympathy god and myself god and myself
To another place from respect joyful girl, thank you 

And I'm ready to release on another day, I'm ready to respect the day today
I'm ready to respect myself today, I'm ready to release 

Self-image confidence troubled comfortable blame touching partake
With grace jealousy wisdom unabashed joy and me you yum
Power transference to equality letting go joy again
Loving do unto others as to yourself, thank you 

And I'm ready to release on another day, I'm ready to respect the day today
I'm ready to respect myself today, I'm ready to release on another day
I'm ready to release myself today, I'm ready to release 

Male female innocent carefree, fate honor and wrong
Success caressing a self love, do to yourself as to others
Comfortable held release, comfortable held release

And I'm ready to release on another day, I'm ready to respect the day today
I'm ready to respect myself today, I'm ready to release on another day
I'm ready to release myself today, I'm ready to release 

And I'm ready to release on another day, I'm ready to respect the day today
I'm ready to respect myself today, I'm ready to release on another day
I'm ready to release myself today, I'm ready to release
