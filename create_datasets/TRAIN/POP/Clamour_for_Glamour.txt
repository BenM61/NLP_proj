People here in your neighbourhood
Act real cool but they dance no good
I don?t care what the others say
When I?ve found a new game to play

So come and get it

People here in your neighbourhood
Act real cool but they dance no good
I don?t care but I?ve been told
That all those people ain?t got no soul
I kick them where the sun don?t shine
And take you down to my side of town
I don?t care what the others say
When I?ve found a new game to play
