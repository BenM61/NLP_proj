Back to nature
I can't go on like this
I want to walk where the power is
Back to nature
I don't know where to start
Back to nature
I don't have that kind of heart

Back to nature
Back to somewhere else
Back to nature
And right back on top of yourself
Back to nature
I've got to look down
See where I am
Or just hit the ground

And I'm telling you
I know what you've been going through
In my heart of hearts
When I was here
You were there
Nothing was between us

We're up in the air
We're down on the ground
We're up in the air
We're down on the ground

Here are your friends again
Inching in the bedroom door
Ah they want to touch me
And you show me their hands
How warm and soft and foreign they are
Look at them, Cubans in surgical gloves
One on top of two on top of three

Well I've got more than you

Back to nature
The voyeur will realize
This is not a sight for his sore eyes
Back to nature
Getting back at you
I couldn't act naturally if I wanted to

Back to nature
A trip that I can't take
People are thinking
That they've dreamed of this place
Back to nature
It was somewhere else
Back to nature
Right back on top of yourself

And I'm telling you
I know what you've been going through
In my heart of hearts
When I was here
You were there
Nothing was between us

We're up in the air
We're down on the ground
We're up in the air
We're down on the ground
