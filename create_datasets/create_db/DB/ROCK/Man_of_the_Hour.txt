The ice is melting in my glass
There's a storm out on the ocean
A picture in a golden frame lying cracked and broken
If you lined up all the losers and stood them in my shoes

They'd put me on a pedestal and crown me prince of fools
'Cause even though you did me wrong,my heart denies the fact
If you give me half a chance,you'll know I'll take you back

If there's a fool born every minute
Then I'm the man of the hour
Seems I've been living a lie for so long now
If there's a spot light then I'm in it

'Cause I haven't got the power
To know when love is over
I'm the man of the hour

There's a time for giving up on love
And a time to stay and fight
I would give anything to be with you tonight
God I must be twisted cause I know your just no good
If you asked me to blind my eyes,then Girl you know I would

If there's a fool born every minute
Then I'm the man of the hour
Seems I've been living a lie for so long now
If there's a spot light then I'm in it

'Cause I haven't got the power
To know when love is over
I'm the man of the hour

Only stabbin' from my heart let it beat again
In my world of self-illusion only you can stop the pain

Even though you did me wrong,my heart denies the fact
If you give me half a chance,you'll know I'll take you back
If there's a fool born every minute
Then I'm the man of the hour

Seems I've been living a lie for so long now
If there's a spot light then I'm in it
'Cause I haven't got the power
To know when love is over
I'm the man of the hour

There's a fool born every minute
There's a spot light then I'm in it
There's a fool born every minute
There's a spot light then I'm in it
There's a fool born every minute
