[Intro] 
Baby whatcha want to do 
Baby whatcha want to do 

Boo I know you're spoken for 
But I adore you 
(I'm making love to you everynight) 
In my mind there's fantasies of what I want to do 
(I can't wait  I'm hungry) 
I'm hungry for a taste of love 
Your body's all I'm thinking of 
(I won't say a word  baby not a single word) 
It'll be baby  baby just between you and me 
(If you don't scream  I won't scream) 

1   If you kiss me, I won't tell 
Suga, suga, suga, suga, suga 
I'll make you feel good, that's no damn lie 
Suga, suga, suga, suga, suga 

If you kiss me, I won't tell 
Suga, suga, suga, suga, suga 
I'll make you feel good, that's no damn lie 
Suga, suga, suga, suga, suga 

I won't tell nobody 
Don't say nothing 
Cause we don't have none 
Jump into the shower 
Let me soak you in my love 
It's about to be on (It's on) 
I've been waiting for this moment for so long 
(Oh, word is bond) 
c'mon if you don't scream, then I won't scream 

Repeat 1 

2 - Sweet like candy, hot like wax 
Slow like honey, dripping down my back 
Sweet like candy, hot like wax 
Slow like honey, dripping down my back 

Sweeter than candy 
Hotter, hotter than wax, hotter than wax 
(repeat 2 at same time) 

Repeat 1 til end with ad-libs
