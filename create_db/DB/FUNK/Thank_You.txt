Sometimes I wonder, do you
Even recognize the woman that's standing in front of you

Listen, sometimes I wonder, do you
Even care or realize why I took care of you
'Cause you're my heart
You are my soul
You're my other half without you I cannot be whole baby

So far apart, I just don't know
What drove us apart in the first place now I know baby, why

These tears I cry sure won't be the last
They will not be the last, no
'Cause this pain inside never seems to pass
It never seems to pass me by

So I thank you
Said I thank you
Yes I thank you
For making me a woman

Sometimes I wonder could she be
More of a woman to you than you are a man to me
Listen, sometimes I wonder, why me
I'm here miserable while you're out living your fantasies and didn't care

'Cause you're my heart
You are my soul
You're my other half without you I cannot be whole baby
So far apart
I just don't know
What drove us apart in the first place now I know baby, why

These tears I cry sure won't be the last
They will not be the last, no
'Cause' this pain inside which never seems to pass
It never seems to pass me by
So I thank you
Said I thank you
Yes I thank you
For making me a woman

One thing I learned in life
We all gotta be ready to sacrifice to survive
I hope she's happy
'Cause you're the chapter that I'll be closing hope you're happy
'Cause once my door close it won't be open

These tears I cry sure won't be the last
It will not be the last, no
This pain inside which never seems to pass
It never seems to pass me by

So I thank you
Said I thank you
Yes I thank you
For making me a woman

So I thank you
Said I thank you
Yes I thank you
For making me a woman
