My imagination, yeah
My imagination is taking me places
It's a celebration but I been here mistaking someone for you
See I fear no one
But love is something I can't do with you, baby, with you

You remind me of a pretty girl, baby
You remind me of a pretty girl, you do
You remind me of a pretty girl, baby, who broke, who broke my heart, baby
That tore my life apart

My imagination, oh yeah
Or maybe it's just what I've been drinking, yeah 
Throughout our conversation
And it keeps having me thinking
Not just the one that you hating
Someone that I shouldn't hold on to
So love, it's something I can't do, can't do with you
With you

You remind me of a pretty girl, baby
You remind me of a pretty girl, you do
You remind me of a pretty girl, baby, who broke, who broke my heart (baby, baby)
Who tore my life apart

You remind me of a pretty girl, baby
You remind me of a pretty girl, you do
You remind me of a pretty girl, baby, who broke, who broke my heart, baby
That tore my life apart
