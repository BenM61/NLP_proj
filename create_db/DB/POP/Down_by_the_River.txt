City life was getting us down so we spent a weekend out town
Pitched our tent on a patch of ground down by the river
Lit a fire and drank some wine you put your jeans on top of mine
I said: Come in
The water's fine

Down by the river
Down by the river
Down by the river

Said: Come in the water's fine down by the river
Didn't feel too good all night
So we took a walk in the morning light
And came across the strangest sight down by the river
Silver fish lay on its side it was washed up by the early tide
I wonder how it died?

Down by the river
Down by the river
Down by the river, silver fish lay on its side

The doctor put us both to bed
He doesed us up and he shook his head
Only foolish people go
He said
Down by the river
The mighty willows weep
Said he

Because they're dying gradually
From the waste from the factories

Down by the river
Down by the river
Down by the river

The mighty willows weep, said he down by the river

And in time the riverbanks will die
The reeds will wilt and the ducks won't fly
There'll be a tear in the otter's eye down by the river
The banks will soon be black and dead
And where the otter raised his head
Will be a clean
White skull instead

Down by the river
Down by the river
Down by the river, the banks will soon be black and dead

Down by the river
Down by the river
The banks will soon be black and dead, down by the river
