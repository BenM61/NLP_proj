I needed your advice but I also needed honest words from time to time
But in a wake of the night
Love has made us strangers, you and I

No frowns, no pain, no love remains
No more maybes
No fake goodbyes, no endless tries
No more maybes

I'm in and out of love
I'm in and out of love
I'm in and out of love with you
I'm in and out of love
I'm in and out of love
I'm in and out of love with you
