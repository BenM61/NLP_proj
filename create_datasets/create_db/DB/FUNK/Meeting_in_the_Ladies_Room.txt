I had to leave my condo to come to this
Well, I'm back but this time I'm with my man
And these women are puttin' their hands all over his
Yamamoto Kanzai sweater that I bought

And I'm much, much unhappy about that
I'd hate to come down to their level and become a BW
A basic woman but if they don't stop it's gonna get scandalous

I've got a meeting in the ladies room
I'll be back real soon
I've got a meeting in the ladies room
I'll be back real soon

I don't know but I think you better watch your man
'Cause girl, he's doin' like nobody else can
If you wanna be sure, you best go powder your nose
'Cause you wanna look good when you step on the floor, that's why

I've got a meeting in the ladies room
I'll be back real soon
I've got a meeting in the ladies room
I'll be back real soon

Sing
Everybody sing it like
Sing

Stepped through the door, they were standin' in line
Smokin' funny cigarettes and takin' their time
Pass me a mirror 'cause I ain't got much time
'Cause there's a hunk of man I done left behind, that's why

I've got a meeting in the ladies room
I'll be back real soon
I've got a meeting in the ladies room
I'll be back real soon

Sing
Everybody sing it like
Sing

Walked on the floor and everybody was jammin'
They're playin' my favorite song, got me singin' along
Can't turn your back for a minute, somebody's rockin' my man
And girl, they're doin' like nobody else can
Watch out, watch out, watch out

Excuse me ladies, this man's with me
I don't like to share, you can plainly see
He looks good, good enough to eat
But believe me lady, he belongs to me, yeah

I've got a meeting in the ladies room
I'll be back real soon
I've got a meeting in the ladies room
I'll be back real soon

I've got a meeting in the ladies room
I'll be back real soon
I've got a meeting in the ladies room
I'll be back real soon

don't slap me
'Cause I'm not in the mood
Don't, don't, don't slap me
'Cause I'm not in the mood

don't slap me
'Cause I'm not in the mood
Don't slap me
'Cause I'm not in the mood

I've got a meeting in the ladies room
I'll be back real soon
I've got a meeting in the ladies room
I'll be back real soon
I've got a meeting in the ladies room
I'll be back real soon
