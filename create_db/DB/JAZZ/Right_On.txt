Oh, do you remember
When we were young? We just had fun

Pedal to the metal, shine into the steel
Sitting up front, Elivisi by the wheel
Putting out of Island Bay, weather looking fine
Flick the switch, needle twitch, FM to the dial
Buddy Toledo singing to the songs
Watching all the p's and q's, nothing can go wrong
Dino Valentino and his lady
Flashes cash as the deals go by, so good to be alive, right on, right on

Oh, do you remember
When we were young? We just had fun

Pieces to the puzzle, music is the word
Franko's on the show, flying out the bird
Somersaults and figure eights, breaking all the rules
Pushing all the pushers, The King of the New School
Buddy Toledo fronting on the stage
Pacifies the masses with a smile & a wave...Dino Valentino and his lady
Counts da cash as deal goes by, so good 2B alive, right on, right on Ah

Oh, do you remember
When we were young? We just had fun
Oh (La la, la-la la)
Do you remember (La la, la-la la)
When we were young? (La la, la-la la)
We just had fun (La la, la-la la)

Oh, do you remember
When we were young? We just had fun

Oh, do you remember
When we were young? We just had fun
Oh (La la, la-la la)
Do you remember (La la, la-la la)
When we were young? (La la, la-la la)
We just had fun (La la, la-la la)
