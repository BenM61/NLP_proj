Clap hands, daddy comes
With a pocket full of plums
Don't cry
Most days I'm okay, come steal my heart

How I wish everything was simple
How I wish everything didn't end in lies
How I wish I could just keep turning back time

How I wish I could be more like me
When I didn't have to worry about myself
How I wish I could just keep turning back time

Forgive me if I cannot try any harder
You make it seem like everything I do
Means nothing at all
As complications go, this can't get any sweeter
Don't cry

Clap hands, daddy comes
With a pocket full of plums
Don't cry
Flashback, twisted up
I'm so close to giving up
Don't cry

Right now I am complicated
Right now I am giving this heart away
How I wish I could just keep turning back time

Right now I'm the walking wounded
Mind set on getting out alive
How I wish I could just keep turning back time

Forgive me if I cannot try any harder
You make it seem like everything I do
Means nothing at all
As complications go, this can't get any sweeter
Don't cry

Clap hands, daddy comes
With a pocket full of plums
Don't cry
Flashback, twisted up
I'm so close to giving up
Don't cry

I should just let go
I should just let go

Forgive me if I cannot try any harder
You make it seem like everything I do
Means nothing at all
As complications go, this can't get any sweeter
Don't cry

Clap hands, daddy comes
With a pocket full of plums
Don't cry
Flashback, twisted up
I'm so close to giving up
Don't cry
