I wake up in the morning
And you are on my mind
Some people that I know would call it love

When I go to sleep in the nighttime
And my dreams get so I find
Some people that I know would call it love

Some people would say that I'm crazy
For saying the things I say
Crazy for feeling the way that I feel about you

Baby you are like a magnet
To this old cold heart of steel
Some people that I know would call it love

I'm an open book just take one look
You'll see how I feel
Some people that I know would call it love

Some people would say that I'm crazy
For saying the things I say
Crazy for feeling the way that I feel about you

Still I wake up in the morning
And you are on my mind
Some people that I know would call it love
Oh, I call it love
