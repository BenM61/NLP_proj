Come on, baby, dry the tears from your eyes
'Cause I'm here for you
Deep in my heart I believe
That you would be much better with me, oh

Just give me a chance to show you my love
The way that love should be
There's no turnin' back with me
'Cause I know I'll give love like you have never had before
I would never (Never) do you wrong (Oh, no)
I would never hurt you the way that she's done
I would never (Never) do you wrong (Never)
I'm just here to show you I just wanna love you

Remember the day, the day that we met
I was crazy for you
And I know that you wanted me
Though you didn't give in easily, no, mmm

And now that I need to know where I stand
Do you want my lovin', baby
Or are you just passing time
While you hold on to love that you know is no good

I would never (I would never) do you wrong (Wrong)
I would never hurt you the way that she's done
I would never (Never) do you wrong (Never)
I'm just here to show you (Oh) I just wanna love you (Oh)

I would never (Never) do you wrong (Oh, no)
I'll never hurt you the way that she's done
I would never (Never) do you wrong (Oh, no)
I'm just here to show you (I'm just here to love you) I just wanna love you (Oh, baby, oh)

Oh, no
Do
Oh, ho, hey, oh, ho
Oh, oh, no
Ooh, oh
Never, never, never, never, never, no

I would never (Never) do you wrong (Oh, baby, no)
I would never hurt you the way that she's done
I would never (Oh, no) do you wrong (Oh, no)
I'm just here to show you (Oh, yeah, ooh, ah, yeah) I just wanna love you

I would never (I wanna please you) do you wrong (Don't wanna tease you)
I'll never hurt you the way that she's done
I would never (Oh, no) do you wrong (Baby, no)
I'm just here to show you (Oh, yeah, hey) I just wanna love you

I would never (Baby, she can't love you like I do) do you wrong
This love I have for you is true
Forever you, forever me, mmm
Baby, this love I have for you is all
I just wanna be the one
To give you love day and night
I just wanna love you

I would never (Yes, I do, oh, no)
I'll never hurt you the way that she's done
I would never (Oh, baby, no, oh, no, no, no)

I would never (I will never) do you wrong (Do you wrong)
I would never hurt you the way that she's done
I would never (Oh, no) do you wrong (Oh, baby, no)
I'm just here to show you (Yes, I am) I just wanna (Oh) love you (Yeah)

I would never (I'll never) do you wrong (I'll never)
I'll never hurt you the way that she's done
I would never (No, baby, no) do you wrong
