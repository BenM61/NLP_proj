Superstar tradesman, stand at the bar
Get a trade son you will go far
You have a house in the ferry and a new guitar
That's never been played before and it never will
Never been played before and it never will

The weather is sunny, you're locked inside
The weather is sunny, oh yes I've tried and I've tried
To keep me sane, to keep me sane
To keep me sane, to keep me sane

I don't want money, I want a thing called happiness
I don't want cash, you know, I'd quite like memories
To keep us on track, let's never look back
To keep us on track, let's never look back

What would you do if I asked you
What would you do if I asked you
To sail away to see some sights?
Sail away with me to see some sights

Superstar tradesman, stand at the bar
Get a trade son you will go far
You have a house in the ferry and a new guitar
That's never been played before and it never will
Never been played before and it never will
