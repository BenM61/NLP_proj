When the mellow moon begins to beam,
Ev'ry night I dream a little dream,
And of course Prince Charming is the theme,
The he for me.
Although I realize as well as you 
It is seldom that a dream comes true,
For me it's clear
That he'll appear.

Some day he'll come along,
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong, 
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay.

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand,
And in a little while,
He'll take my hand,
And though it seems absurd, 
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not 
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

He'll build a little home
Just meant for two,
From which I'll never roam, 
Who would, would you?
And so all else above
I'm waiting for the man I love.
