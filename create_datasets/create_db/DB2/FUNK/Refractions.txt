I had a most distressing dream last night
I dreamed I was a crystal bird
Caught in perpetual flight

I'd ascend and glide and descend and ride
On the wind and never alight
I had a most distressing dream last night

Glass enclosed, exposed wherever I flew
With no control and a crystal soul
That one could see right through

No ethereal nest where I could rest
I was frightened by what I knew
That my two crystal legs were broken in two

When I awoke my heart was beating fast
As if all night and endless flight
An eternity had passed

As I shook my head and slipped from my bed
Released from the prism, at last
I stepped upon a bit of shattered glass
