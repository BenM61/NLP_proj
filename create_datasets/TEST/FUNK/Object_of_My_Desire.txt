You glance my way
I almost lost control
Anxiety has taken hold
My body quivers
You flash every night in my sleep

Gazing deep into my eyes
You spoke these words
I was hypnotized
Let me share a night in your fantasy

Turn on emotions so strong
Tensions fire burns on and on
My body screams,
Please make love to me!

You're the object of my desire
Come on baby, light my fire

When I go to sleep at night
Visions of you here by my side
Fireworks explode deep inside of me
I pinch myself as you're lying there
We kiss each other now I'm really scared
Too much to ask, even for a fantasy

Turn on emotions so strong
Passions fire burns on and on
My body screams,
Please make love to me!

You're the object of my desire
Come on baby, light my fire
Cause you're the object of my desire
Hey, you really turn me on
You're the object of my desire
Won't you ignite my fire?
Hey you really turn me on and on and on and on...

I need your love
