Do-do-do, do-do-do do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do
Do-wah

Don't write me no letters
Don't even telephone 
I want you person to person (person to person)
Bring your little fine self on home

Don't send me no message
You know, you know, you know
I'm all alone
I need you person to person
Bring your little fine self on home

Ain't no use to telephone me (no-no, no-no)
I can't love no telephone (no-no, no-no)
All the time you're telephonin' (no-no, no-no)
You could be comin' home (yes-yes, yes-yes)
Ain't no use to send no letter (no-no, no-no)
I can't hold no paper tight (no-no, no-no)

Ain't no use to send no message (no-no, no-no)
It can't talk to me at night (no-no, no-no)
Ain't no use to send your brother (no-no, no-no)
I won't talk to no one else (no-no, no-no)
Ain't no use to send your mother (no-no, no-no)
You just gotta come yourself

Little girl, I have suffered
Um, each day that you've been gone (gone, gone, gone)
I need you person to person (person)

Oh, bring me your little a-fine self on home!

(Bring your fine self on home)
