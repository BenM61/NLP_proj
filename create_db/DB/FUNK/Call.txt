When you call I come running baby,
Baby when you call I'll be right there baby, baby when you
Call I come running baby, baby when you call I'll be right.

What's the deal with you and me I know you feel the chemistry,

Ooh I feel it coming on the way I feel it baby it just can't be wrong ooooh! 
I want you needing me and I'll come running baby that's the way it's gonna be.
