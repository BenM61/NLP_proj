Just because you know I love you so much
Don't be afraid to tell me you're sad
Because you lost his love
Though your love is not for me
I don't want to see you in mystery, so come on, baby come on

You can cry on my shoulder
You can cry on my shoulder
And bring all your troubles to me
All your troubles to me

Big girls ain't supposed to cry, 
If you do I'll understand, 
Maybe I can show you how you can win his love again
It may seem strange I know
But it's just that I love you
So come on, baby come on

You can cry on my shoulder
You can cry on my shoulder
And bring all your troubles to me
All your troubles to me

Girl you've given him all you had
He,d better stop treating you so bad, 
Come on babe, come on, oh yeah

You can cry on my shoulder, yes you can girl
You can cry on my shoulder
And bring all your troubles to me, yeah babe, yes you can now
Darling, oh, oh yes, yes you can girl
I'll be there to help, 

You can cry, you can cry, you can cry
Baby
(You can cry on my shoulder) 
Oh yeah babe, yeah babe
(You can cry on my shoulder) 
You can cry, you can cry
