One thousand faces all look the same
They're all so boring mild and tame,
Contaminate him
Knock off his glasses
Teach him to tamper with the cloning process.

Pardon me Sir, can I ask you a favor
Make me a cowboy like my nextdoor neighbor
Pardon me sir, can I use your eraser
To remove my brain of unconventional nature.

Take my tongue, it's cocked and loaded
The board has dubbed you a special student
Sit alone sweat in a silence
We don't tolerate defiance
Yeah, yeah

One thousand faces lead to the gate
They're all so boring mild sedate
You hear me say this don't make any sense
As I hop up and over the fence

Take my tongue, it's cocked and loaded
The board has dubbed you a special student
Sit alone, sweat in silence
We don't tolerate defiance
Yeah, yeah

Hooked on Nicotine and Phonix
Fun like macro-economics
Still and quiet like they taught us
Fun like macro-economics
(Go, Go, Oh Yeah)

Vigilante thoughts and a cheap guitar
I am my own movie star
I don't know you, I don't want to
I don't know you, I don't want to
Yeah

Take my tongue, it's cocked and loaded
You've been dubbed a special student
So you sit alone, sweat in silence
We don't tolerate defiance
Vigilante thoughts and a cheap guitar
I am my own movie star
I don't know you, I don't want to
I don't know you, I don't want to
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
