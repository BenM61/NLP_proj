Then dawn came and I stayed and was laughing with you
The smoke love then I dove and was kissing  with you
My past erase as we lay in a daze
Ohoao
Please say nothing of yesterdays ohoa

I'm going to sleep
I'm going to sleep under the stars until the end 
Till your touch say time will it begin
I'm going to love until the bitter end

Working days get in my way
As I'm thinking of you
Smoke love
Keep dreaming of when I was kissing with you
My past erase as we lay in a daze
Ohooaaaaoo
Please say nothing of yesterdays ohoa
