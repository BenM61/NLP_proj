Do you, do you, do you

Oh babe, I'm watching you baby
Me and you in the mirror
And baby I love, the faces you make
Can't be any clearer
You gon' be working all through the night
Putting in over-time
And you know, exactly what I need
So turn the music down
I wanna hear the sounds, of us in love
It's only me and you

Don't stop doing what you do
Keep doing what you do, do
Do you, do you
Do you like the way I'm doing you?
When I do you, you
Do you? do you?
Do you like the way that I put it down on you?
It's only me and you
Do you like the way that I put it down on you?
Do you? do you? do you? do you?
Intoxicate me and I get a rush from you
Do you? do you?
Girl it's running through my veins
Can you feel it in the same kind of places?

You gon' be working all through the night
Putting in over-time
And you know, exactly what I need
So turn the music down
I wanna hear the sounds, of us in love
It's only me and you

Don't stop doing what you do
Keep doing what you do, do
Do you, do you
Do you like the way I'm doing you?
When I do you, you
Do you? do you?
Do you like the way that I put it down on you?
It's only me and you
Do you like the way that I put it down on you?
Do you? do you? do you?
Do you like, if I take my time and do this right?
Do you know how I feel inside?
I'll show you tonight
It's getting closer, closer, closer
So don't stop doing what you do

Don't stop doing what you do
Keep doing what you do, do
Do you, do you
Do you like the way I'm doing you?
When I do you, you
Do you? do you?
Don't stop doing what you do
Keep doing what you do, do
Do you, do you
Do you like the way I'm doing you?
When I do you, you
Do you? do you?
