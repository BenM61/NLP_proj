It's getting late and something is waiting in the city tonight
This place is crazy 
And it makes me wanna f*ck up my mind
I like the lights the trippy lights
And all the pornographic stores
I light this thing 
As they complain about the junkies and the whores

When I was younger
I dreamed I'd come here and I guess I did
Survive the scum and I'd become someone but never did
These village slums I let become my life I guess I did
I'm just a bum pathetic scum that's just the way I live

This is the life
You want the life
No

It's getting late and guess who's playing in the city tonight
This place is amazing 
And it makes me wanna fucking get high
I love the way the buildings sway 
And all the garbage on the streets
The sounds of trains and sirens
Make lovely music while I sleep

I'm going farther than I ever thought far could be
By twenty one I had a gun and ditched authority
At twenty two I never knew the sights I would see 
At twenty four I made the score that killed that part of me

This is the life
You want the life
No
