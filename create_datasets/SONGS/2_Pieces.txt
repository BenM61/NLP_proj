Girl I know that I've caused you so much pain 
(Runnin' round here and caught up with my games)
Tried to put it off on you but I'm the one to blame 
(And it started wearing on my conscience)

I can't say I'm sorry enough 
Don't know how you put up with me 
For so long when I've been so wrong
And I thank you for not giving up on me

Baby I can't take the thought of losing you
'Cause I know that it would break break my heart in two pieces
Girl, I don't wanna lose you

Now all I wanna do is right by you 
(Which is what I should've been doing all along)
Make up for the times I wasn't so nice to you 
(It's a wonder you even stuck around)
And you stuck around

I can't say I'm sorry enough 
Don't know how you put up with me 
The way you do and the way I treated you
And I thank you for not giving up on me yeah oh

Baby I can't take the thought of losing you
'Cause I know that it would break break my heart in two pieces
Girl, I don't wanna lose you

You didn't have to stay but you did 
I'm lucky that you're heart is so big 
'Cause you love me unconditionally 
And it's time for me to love you just the same

Baby I can't take the thought of losing you
'Cause I know that it would break break my heart in two pieces
Girl, I don't wanna lose you
