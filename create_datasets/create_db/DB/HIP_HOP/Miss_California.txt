She's a rich girl from the top of the food chain
Love and material things, kinda lonely
Til I met her at the Grammys, 10mil on a diamond ring
She invites me to spend a day on the jet skies
At first it didn't mean a thing
Then she told me I'm the one that she searched for
It was hard to believe.

[Chorus]
She's miss California, hottest thing in west L.A.
House down by the water, sails her yacht across the bay
Drives a maranello, Hollywood's her favorite scene
Loves to be surrounded with superstars that know her name.

In a couple a days she had me a bracelet
Made, from Harry Winstons place
Went horseback up to the mountain top
Shown me the land she's got,
Well its alright but something else is on your mind,
Looking past all that shines now the tears are running through
All those things are nice but it's not why I'm here
I will wipe away your tears simply by just loving you.

[Chorus]
