Heavy on your heart
Heavy on your mind
Wandering the streets tonight
If you're looking for a home
You are not alone
I can be your guiding line

'Cause I promise you
I'm a dreamer too
Heavy on my heart
Wandering the streets tonight

When it all counts for something
And your pocket's full of nothing
Let's get high on believing
I can promise you
Yes, I am a dreamer too
We are dreamers together
Always and forever
Let's get high on believing
I can promise you
Yes, I am a dreamer too

I can promise you
Yes, I am a dreamer too
Let's get high on believing
I can promise you
Yes, I am a dreamer too

Heavy on my feet
Heavy on me knees
Walking down a winding road
If you're looking for a home
You are not alone
I can be your stepping stone

'Cause I promise you
I'm a dreamer too
Heavy on my feet
Walking down a winding road

When it all counts for something
And your pocket's full of nothing
Let's get high on believing
I can promise you
Yes, I am a dreamer too
We are dreamers together
Always and forever
Let's get high on believing
I can promise you
Yes, I am a dreamer too

I can promise you, I can promise you
I can promise you, I can promise you
I can promise you, I can promise you
I can promise you, I can promise you
I can promise you, I can promise you
I can promise you, I can promise you

Yes I am a dreamer too
I can promise you
Yes I am a dreamer too
We are dreamers together
Always and forever
Let's get high on believing
I can promise you
Yes I am a dreamer too
