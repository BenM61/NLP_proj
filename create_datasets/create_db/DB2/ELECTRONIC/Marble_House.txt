I cut your nails
And comb your hair
I carry you
Down the stairs

I wanted to see right through
From the other side
I wanted to walk a trip
With no end in sight

The moment we believe that we have never met
Another kind of love, it's easy to forget
When we are all alone and waiting for some treat
We have a thing in common, this was meant to be

You close my eyes
And soothe my ears
You heal my wounds
And dry my tears

On the inside of this marble house
I grow
And the seeds I slow
Grow persistent too

The moment we believe that we have never met
Another kind of love, it's easy to forget
When we are all alone and waiting for some treat
We have a thing in common, this was meant to be

That as we shoulder our
What is it's name
What's your sin
Say it again

As the ghost pass by
Can you still follow me?
It must be sane
When it's on TV

I raise my hands to heaven for curiosity
I don't know what to ask for
What has it got for me?
The eyes see how hideous this marble house can be
Somethings I do for money somethings I do for free
