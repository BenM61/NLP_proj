Pinky promise
It?s gonna be alright
It?s gonna be alright
It?s gonna be alright
It?s gonna be alright

Many late nights when she's all alone
She always call me up on the phone
Begging me to come and spend the night
Because she wants to rub me in her honeycomb

What she need is just a friend like me
What she need is just a good friend like me
What she need is just a friend like me
What she need is just a good friend like me

Told her friends that I treat her right
And I love to vibe all day
Feels so good just to be around
A lotta times she don't want me to go away

What she need is just a friend like me
What she need is just a good friend like me
What she need is just a friend like me
What she need is just a good friend like me

After all you can't deny
I took her where her feels
Can't go on, you can't pretend
That's why she's asking me again

What she need is just a friend like me
What she need is just a good friend like me
What she need is just a friend like me
What she need is just a good friend like me

It?s gonna be alright
It?s gonna be alright
It?s gonna be alright
It?s gonna be alright
It?s gonna be alright
It?s gonna be alright

What she need is just a friend like me
What she need is just a good friend like me
What she need is just a friend like me
What she need is just a good friend like me

What she need is just a friend like me
What she need is just a good friend like me
What she need is just a friend like me
What she need is just a good friend like me

What she need is just a friend like me
What she need is just a good friend like me
What she need is just a friend like me
What she need is just a good friend like me

What she need is just a friend like me
What she need is just a good friend like me
What she need is just a friend like me
What she need is just a good friend like me
True
