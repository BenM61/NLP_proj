The evening breeze
Caressed the trees, tenderly
The trembling trees
Embraced the breeze, tenderly

Then you and I
Came wandering by
And lost in a sigh
Were we

The shore was kissed
By sea and mist, tenderly
I can't forget
How two hearts met
Breathlessly

Your arms opened wide
And closed me inside
You took my lips
You took my love
So tenderly

Your arms opened wide
And closed me inside
You took my lips
You took my love
So tenderly
