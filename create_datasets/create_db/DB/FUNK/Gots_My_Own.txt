Now you wildin' in the club
Shorty keep askin' you what's up
Sho 'nough
(Are they feelin' you?)

'Cause they keep on looking you up and down
That's what's up
(Can we chill with you?)
Yes, indeedy come and slide with me

Come and grab a seat and just tell me what you're thinking
(Oh)
You see my diamonds, cop a smile now
And you try to figure out what's outside now

(Think you can figure me out)
Oh no, I don't think so
While you think about it
I'm already on the road

(Oh no)
'Cause I need you to offer me something new
Don't talk about rides 'cause I got's my own driver
Don't talk about trips 'cause I got's to make hits
When I'm done, I need someone to chill with

(Oh no)
Don't talk about planes 'cause I got's my own pilot
Don't talk about banks, my accountant just wires it
Don't talk about gear cause I got's my own line
So don't get mad cause you P S is hiring

Don't talk about it baby, be about it
What you say you got, I already got it
You heavy in the game but I'm saturated
You trying to figure me out, but you just can't figure me out

Don't talk about it baby, be about it
What you say you got, I already got it
You heavy in the game but I'm saturated
You trying to figure me out, but you just can't figure me out

Now you pull up in a truck
Tryn'a act like you don't see the Phantom
What?
(Am I killin' ya?)

'Cause you act like a girl, can't come up and run the club
(See nothin' new)
If you feel me all my ladies say
Fellas, change ya game

I'm just tired of hearing the same thang
(Oh)
See I need something different in my life, man
(Why you trying to figure out?)

I'll just keep steppin'
(Think you be holdin' me down?)
Oh no, I don't think so
While you think about it, I'm already on the road

(Oh no)
'Cause I need you to offer me something new
Don't talk about rides 'cause I got's my own driver
Don't talk about trips 'cause I got's to make hits
When I'm done, I need someone to chill with

(Oh no)
Don't talk about planes 'cause I got's my own pilot
Don't talk about bank, my accoutant just wires it
Don't talk about gear cause I got's my own line
So don't get mad cause you P S is hiring

Don't talk about it baby, be about it
What you say you got, I already got it
You heavy in the game but I'm saturated
You trying to figure me out, but you just can't figure me out

Don't talk about it baby, be about it
What you say you got, I already got it
You heavy in the game but I'm saturated
You trying to figure me out, but you just can't figure me out

Don't look at me, crazy
I need more than just money
I just think you're caught up, flaws
A man don't know a good thing

That's why I wanna school you
And let you know who's who
And I believe once you get hip on game
I think you know what to do
No talk about loving, what you can do for me

Don't talk about it baby, be about it
What you say you got, I already got it
You heavy in the game but I'm saturated
You trying to figure me out, but you just can't figure me out
