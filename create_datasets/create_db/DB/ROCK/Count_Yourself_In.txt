Beyond the common grind 
From nine to five the dead end jobs we find
We try to hide
We struggle through the means to meet the end
Please tell me that this life isn't permanent

We don't care enough 
(We don't care enough) 
Look who's pulled it off
Look what get's me off
Gets me through the in sober days

You don't deserve to be unnoticed
You don't deserve to be treated like that
(We don't deserve to be unnoticed) 

Days and weeks go by 
And seasons change 
The scenery gets old
It stays the same 
There's nothing in this town
But you and I
So baby pack your bags we leave tonight

'Cause we don't care enough 
(We don't care enough) 
Look who's pulled it off
Look what get's me off 
Gets me through the in sober days 

You don't deserve to be unnoticed
You don't deserve to be treated like that 
We don't deserve to be unnoticed 
So where'd it go? 

You don't deserve to be unnoticed
You don't deserve to be treated like that
We don't deserve to be unnoticed
So where'd it go? 

So spend our nights awake
Rest every small town along the way
Here's to bad times
They were the best times 
Give up the good times
And we'll survive

'Cause we don't care enough
(We don't care enough) 
Look who's pulled it off
Look what get's me off
Gets me through the in sober days 

You don't deserve to be unnoticed
You don't deserve to be treated like that
We don't deserve to be unnoticed
So where'd it go
