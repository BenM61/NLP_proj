You ask me all kinds of questions
Like I, I've got something to hide
And I don't know why this all began

You used to love me for freedom
Said you'd climb aboard and fly
Now we're on the ground, and I'm locked in

I don't want to lie
Sayin' it's alright
Starin' at the walls 'round our lives
And are Ten Feet High
No, I'm not dumb

You don't need to smile
When you hurt inside
I can see the doubt in your eyes
And the fun we had is done
But I won't sit and watch you
Go cold when summer has left the room
This curtain is closing
I'm not stayin' to see the end

We said we'd never become this
And tell each other how to live
But now I know your high times aren't with me

We keep finding more ways
To escape you and me
Pretend you're asleep when you're lying awake

I'm not gonna lie
Say it's alright
Starin' at the walls 'round our lives
We were Ten Feet High
No, I'm not dumb

You don't need to smile when you hurt inside
I can see the doubt in your eyes
And the sun we had is down
But I don't want to
Say it's over when I still love you
Don't say it's over when I still love you

I won't let it go cold
When summer has left the room
This curtain is closing
I'm not stayin' to see the end

I won't watch it grow old
When summer has left the room
This curtain is closing
I'm not stayin' to be the end

Say it's over and I still love you
Say it's over and I still love you
