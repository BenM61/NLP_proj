Take the moment, let it happen
Hug the moment, make it last
Hold the feeling for the moment
Or the moment will have passed

All the noises buzzin' in your head
Warning you to wait, what for?
Don't listen, let it happen

Take the moment
Make the moment
Many moments more
Make for us a thousand more

Take the moment, let it happen
Hug the moment, make it last
Hold the feeling for the moment
Or the moment will have passed

All the noises buzzin' in your head
Warning you to wait, what for?
Don't listen, let it happen

Take the moment
Make the moment
Many moments more
Make for us a thousand more
