Oh you railway station!
Oh you Pullman Train!
There's my reservation
For my destination,
Far beyond the western plains
To see my home in Pasadena.
Home where grass is greener
Where honeybees
Hum melodies
And orange trees scent the breeze.
I'm gonna see a home-sweet-homer
And there I'll settle down
Beneath the palms
In someone's arms
In Pasadena town.

Where honeybees hum melodies
And orange trees scent the breeze.

Beneath the palms
In someone's arms
In Pasadena town.

Home home home home in Pasadena,
Home home home home where grass is greener.
Where the little bees, they hum melodies,
And orange trees scent the breeze.
I'm gonna be a home-sweet-homer
And right there I'll settle down
Beneath the palms
In someone's arms
In Pasadena town.
