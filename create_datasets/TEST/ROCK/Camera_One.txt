The sandy haired son of Hollywood
Lost his faith in all that's good
Closed the curtain, unplugged the clock
Hung his clothes on the shower rod
But he never got undressed
And no, he never made a mess

It's funny how life turns out
The odds of faith in the face of doubt
Camera One closes in
The soundtrack starts
The scene begins

You're playing you now
You're playing you now
You're playing you now
You're playing you now
You're playing you now
Take a bow
Take a bow

The trophy wife from Palisades
Whose yearbook beauty never fades
Sits and watches the sea fold in
And wonders what might have been
If she could ever have the chance
Would she do it all again?

It's funny how life turns out
The odds of faith in the face of doubt
Camera One closes in
The soundtrack starts
The scene begins

You're playing you now
You're playing you now
You're playing you now
You're playing you now
You're playing you now
Take a bow
Take a bow

On the corner 
By his streets
He sits in his lawnchair
In the heat
Sightseers see 
What they want
They're selling star-maps 
To the sun

The sunny-haired son of Hollywood
Lost his faith in all that's good
Closed the curtain, unplugged the clock
Hung his clothes on the shower rod
But he didn't get undressed
And no, he didn't seem depressed

It's funny how life turns out
The odds of faith in the face of doubt
Camera One closes in
The soundtrack starts
The scene begins

You're playing you now
You're playing you now
You're playing you now
You're playing you now
You're playing you now
You're playing you now
You're playing you now
Take a bow
Take a bow
Take a bow
Take a bow
