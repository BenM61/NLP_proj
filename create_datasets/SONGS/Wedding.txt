Will you?
I do, I do, I do
Will you marry me?
I do, I do, I do
Will you marry me?
I do, I do, I do
Will you?
I do, I do, I do

Will you?
I do, I do, I do
Will you marry me?
I do, I do, I do
Will you marry me?
I do, I do, I do
Will you?
I do, I do, I do

I know I turn you on
You do, you do, you do
You want me all alone
I do, I do, I do
Just for those who dare
I see, I see, I see
Rich beyond compare
I know, I know, I know

Forget about the small
Okay, okay, okay
We can get it all
I know, I know, I know
You know what we could be
Tell me, tell me, tell me
So join the enemy
I will, I will, I will

Will you?
I do, I do, I do
Will you marry me?
I do, I do, I do
Will you marry me?
I do, I do, I do
Will you?
I do, I do, I do
