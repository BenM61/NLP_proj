We've been waiting for the sun
We've been waiting for the sun
To come out and play
All these rainy days
Are getting on

We've been waiting for the stars
We've been waiting for the stars
Just to light the way
And take the night away
And paint us gold

So no one can catch us
Nothing can change this
Covered in stardust
Invincible and
Jumping off the edge
Reaching for the moon
Living everyday
Invincible like

Oh

We are waiting on a dream
We are waiting on a dream
So we go to sleep
But nothing happens when
We wait too long

So we'll go where

No one can catch us
Nothing can change this
Covered in stardust
Invincible and
Jumping off the edge
Reaching for the moon
Living everyday
Invincible like

Oh

Yeah yeah

No one can catch us
Nothing can change this
Covered in stardust
Things so glowing
Jumping off the edge
Reaching for the moon
Living everyday
Invincible

No one can catch us
Nothing can change this
Covered in stardust
Things so glowing
Jumping off the edge
Reaching for the moon
Living everyday
