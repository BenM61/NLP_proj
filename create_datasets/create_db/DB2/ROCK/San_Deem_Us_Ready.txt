To the dearest one, hottest one, bestest one
I know in California
Stayed there and lived there
'Cause that's exactly where your mommy born ya
So unfortunate for me
Cause I'm stuck here in Tennessee
You know

It's the longest time, hardest time, longest time
I've from loving you
Stayed here and lived here
But hope you hear what I'm tellin' you
So fortunate for me
'Cause I'm leaving Tennessee soon
I know

I know 
I'm just not much without you
Feel that way too
Please just for me!

Don't regret me, forget me, or get me wrong
Cause I'm so far away
It shouldn't be too long before I make my way
To sweet CA
Let me tell you I love you in my own little special way
I know
You're so hot as Speedo says
You make me m-m-m-m-m-elt

Oh oh oh

I know 
I'm just not much without you
Feel that way too
Please just for me!
Please just for me!

Oh Oh Oh
Whoa!
I know
Na na na na na
