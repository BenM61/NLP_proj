Down there by the river
Underneath a tree
I wish you were here with me
Deep down in the water
Secluded from the world
My heart unfurler

I'm filled with love
From far above
I'm unputdownable
I found a light
In the dead of night
Yeah I'm feeling fine
The river flows
The feeling grows
I'm unputdownable
Lead me on and on
Lead me on and on

Though it takes forever
I'm waiting patiently
Until you are here with me
Arrogance and anger
Curve the way to light
And lead into the night
