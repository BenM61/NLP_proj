Where are you going boy 
Off to find your life 
Travel throughout the world 
You got dreamers sight 

Chorus: 
Then away tonight 
Burn another wall 
Actions wait in state 
You won't have to bother 

Where's your beginning boy 
Off to find an end 
Travel around the world 
Till you find love 

Chorus 

Where are you going boy 
Lost to find your way 
Travel throughout the world 
You got dreamers sight 

Chorus
