I got a chrome-plated heart
I got wings on these fingers trying to tear it apart
I got angels crying from up above
And they got rust in their eyes
They got rust on their love
But I have learned to leave no stone unturned
And keep the wall against my back
And the love is real as the day is long
And the night is black
As black as night

I got a two dollar stare
Midas in my touch and Delilah in my hair
I got bad intentions on the soles of my shoes
With this red hot fever and these chromium blues
And I will feel another lovers wheel
And drive for miles and not look back
And the love is real as the day is long
And the night is black
As black as night

On my chrome-plated heart
Wings on these fingers trying to tear it apart
I got angels crying from up above
And they got rust in their eyes
They got rust on their love
And the only way I know where the train will go
Is when I'm sleeping on the tracks
And the love is real as the day is long
And the night is black
As black as night
And the night is black
As black as night
