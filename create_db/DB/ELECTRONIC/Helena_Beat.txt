Sometimes life it takes you by the hand
It puts you down before you know it
It's gone and you're dead again
I've been in places and I won't pretend
That I make it I just fall on my head
When it's strange to take a walk downstairs
Sweep you all up on a corner and pay for my bread
You know that I cannot believe my own truth
To show what a truth, it's got nothing to lose

Yeah yeah and it's okay
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah yeah and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison but I'll hold on tight

You know those days when you wanted to choose
To not get out of bed and get lost in your head again
You play the game but you gotta cut
'Cause you're coming down hard your joints are off stud
I tried to say that's not the only way
I never knew if I could convince myself to change
You were pacing, I was insecure
Slip and fall I got the calls of the prison I was living in

Yeah yeah and it's okay
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah yeah and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison but I'll hold on tight

Yeah yeah and it's okay
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah yeah and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison, a sip of something poison

Yeah yeah and it's okay
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah yeah and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison but I'll hold on tight

Yeah yeah and it's okay
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah yeah and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison, a sip of something poison
