Bom bom bom bom - bom bom bom bom
Mr. Soft turn it on and force the world
And watch the things you're going through
Oh Mr. Soft believe ev'rything they tell you
And be damned if they'll thank you
You paint ev'rything so cruel
Comin' on like mister cool
Paint your face and shut the gate
No one's comin' home till late - ooh-la cha

Bom bom bom bom
Don't you know, life gets tedious enough
Without this extra grudge to bare
You so slow, shift your ideas, make your mind up
In a jiffy, let's be fair
We'd all be taken off tonight
Turn off your eyes and shut the light
Oh, you're the most, you're so unreal
We'd all be dead without your spiel
Ooh-la ooh take it 

Mmmmmm ...
Ooh - bom bom bom bom

Oh Mr. Soft, go to town and bring the dawnin'
In the mornin' on your way
Mr. Soft, put your feet upon the waters
And play Jesus for that day
You begin to hear them mumble
Spot the starman, ruff and tumble
Fight the good fights, sling your axe
Watch the speaker, lead the packs
Ooh - here we go again
