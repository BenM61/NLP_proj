THE WHISPER'S GETTING LOUDER
A STORM OF SILENCE IN MY HEAD
MY CONVICTIONS MADE ME A DOUBTER
WHICH CAME FIRST, THE HUNGRY OR THE FED?

FLOWERS IN MY GARDEN
WITH COLORS YET UNKNOWN
WHEN SPRINGTIME COMES ONE WONDERS
WHAT SEEDS WERE SPREAD AND GROWN

BREAK THE CHAIN, BREAK THE CHAIN
WE CAN LOOSE ONE DAY
BREAK THE CHAIN, BREAK THE CHAIN
AND TRY AGAIN

DARKNESS ALWAYS DAZZLED ME
SO I WEAR SHADES AT NIGHT
IT'S HARD WHEN YOU DISCOVER THE 
BLINDNESS LACKS INSIGHT
                        
MAYBE LIFE'S ONE MOMENT
MAYBE “RENT TO OWN”
WE PAY OUR DUES LIKE INTEREST
ON AN EVERLASTING LOAN

THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS
IS VERY HARD TO FIND
EFFORTS AIMED IN DARKNESS
PRETENDING I DON'T MIND
FRIGHTENED TO CHANGE
THOUGH I KNOW I CAN
NEED TO WALK ON, YEAH
