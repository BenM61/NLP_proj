Affirmative no further furnishing is needed
I believe we are completed, dig
We all in agreement on the wall paper
Happy with the color scheme welcome to the crib
A two family habitat for humanity with a view with in the insanity
Live
My vida loca was built like bob vila villa gone
He architected, I arted what I harbored Jimmy Carter from Chicago's west side
Finish my construction now we hold we coming like contracepts
I'm conciespet that kunta get from conversation held with the Satan on my shoulder
Which lead the steps that kept me looking over the shoulder like chauffeurs were my angels at
Painful yet Mary I ain't Jerry Garcia ma here but I'm grateful church

[Chorus]
We just might be OK
After all
Sun don't shine
On this day

This feeling getting heavy is heaven
I am Atlas at this manage the balance
Massive mass pull my back with out tipping my glasses
This was not pitiful from passes of O G s
This is so me
Ask us many mention little homie, little bony
But the rhymes is fat
In fact
Just like a Rochester customer
God bless the mothers and younger brother is a hustler
Cause she don't want sob at his wake
But he want to follow in the step
Bang his hat learn his shake
Master his swagger in the bathroom
Mirror cop a Chevy steady mob in his place
Chea it's just the problem we face look his mom is in the face n promises his strait

Then he leaves the house that love built that
Hug renovate that section 8 pays for
Well lets pray for 'em
Let the beat play for 'em
Put the trouble on display for 'em
Cause he gotta go face the drama
With a difference face from the one that he use to face his momma
If you look close
You'll see it consists of a smile that hurts a ice grill
In a trace of trauma
Little bit of his father
Another criterion that's no difference from a young Liberian
Who let the delirium worry him living in it the city
Out of his mind
Liria reconsilia
I'm cool I don't for tell best
I ain't nicest MC, I ain't cornel west
I am cornel west side chi town Guevara
Malcolm exorcise the demons
Gangster leaning
He traded in his kufi for a new era
Chose a 44 over a mortar board
I ain't a credited institute graduate
I ain't from Nazareth
My conception wasn't immaculate
I ain't mastering no calculus
A good addition to the rap audience
I back flipped on the mattress they slept on me on
What down Joe, knowing is half the battle
Fighting temptation, have an apple
Shakes the snakes, pimp the system
Let's get into it, tabernacle
