I'm confessin' that I love you
Tell me, do you love me too?
I'm confessin' that I need you; honest, I do
Ah, baby, need you every moment

In your eyes I read such strange things, babe
But your lips deny their true lovin'
Will your answer really change things?
Makin' me blue? Makin' me blue

I'm afraid someday you'll leave me
Say, can't we still be friends? (?)
If you go, you know, you'll grieve me
All in life on you depends, oh baby, do you know, oh?

Am I guessin' that you love me? Love me, babe
Dreamin' dreams of you I've been wanting long
I'm confessin' that I love you
Over again
