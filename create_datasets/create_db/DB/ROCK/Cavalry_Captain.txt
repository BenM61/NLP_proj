I am the cavalry captain
I am the remedy to your heart
I am the carbon collected
I am the printed upon your stars

And when you shine, shine your eyes
Looking lost, looking bright
Wheel away on the light brigade

And if only for a second
(Only for a second)
And if only for a time
(Only for a time)
And if only for a second
(Only for a second)
And if only for a time
We'll be alive
We'll be alive, oh oh

I am the cavalry captain
I am the remedy to your heart
I am the carbon collected
I am the printed upon your stars, oh oh

There is a world, there is a time
Looking calm, looking kind
Wheel away at the break of day

And if only for a second
(Only for a second)
And if only for a time
(Only for a time)
And if only for a second
(Only for a second)
And if only for a time
We'll be alive
We'll be alive, oh oh, oh oh

I am the cavalry captain
I am the remedy to your heart
I am the carbon collected
I am the printed upon your stars, oh oh, oh oh

I am the cavalry captain
I am the remedy to your heart
I am the carbon collected
I am the printed upon your stars
