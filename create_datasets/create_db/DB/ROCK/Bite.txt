You tell your friends you're just well built
But maybe you're fat. Have you thought about that?
You've got to bite that food, got to bite that food
You've gotta get it inside you.
You better try diet before it's too late,
Or I'll remove your excess weight with a potato peeler.
You've got to bite that food, you've got to bite that food
You've gotta get it inside you.
Bite that bun, bite that pie,
You gotta drink that shake before you die.
You've got to bite that food, bite that food
You've gotta get it inside you
You've gotta get it inside you
You've gotta get it inside you
You're the king of the obese, you say you can't do anymore
But I'd like to see you as a prisoner of war.
You've got to bite that food, you've got to bite that food
You've gotta get it inside you
You've got to bite, bite, bite,
You've gotta get it inside you (etc)
You've got to bite, bite, bite, bite, bite
You've gotta get it inside you
You've got to bite, bite, bite,
You've gotta get it inside you (etc)
You've got to bite, bite, bite, bite, bite
