Ring the living bell 
Ring the living bell 
Shine the living light 
Shine the living light 
Ring the living bell 
Ring the living bell 

Been celebrating 'way too long 
An' I've been drinkin', I'm ashamed to tell 
Still feel thirsty 
God I want to drink the water from the well 
Still feel thirsty 
God I want to drink and ring the living bell 
Ring the bell, ah 
Ring the living bell 
Still feel thirsty 
God, I want to give and ring the living bell 

I'm not a magic lady 
But I want to sing to help the light 
Descend on the earth today 
Because it's gonna get dark tonight 
Sing the light, ah 
Sing the living light 
Still feel weak, but God, 
I want to give and shine the living light 
Still feel weak, but God, 
I want to give and shine the living light 

Been walking down the street all night 
An' I been feeling kinda cold
Still feel naked
God I want to be warm before I get old and I'm cold
Ah, an' I'm feeling cold 
Still feel hungry 
God I want to give and ring the living bell 
Still feel hungry 
God I want to live and ring the living bell 

Been celebrating 'way too long 'n' I have eaten much too well 
Still feel hungry 
God I want to give and ring the living bell 
Ring the bell, ah 
Ring the living bell 
Still feel hungry 
God I want to give and ring the living bell 
Still feel hungry 
God I want to give and ring the living bell 
Still feel hungry 
God I want to give and ring the living bell 
Ring the living bell 

Ring the living bell, ring the living bell 
Shine the living light
