When someone tears your heart in two

It's in your eyes, you are sleeping all alone
It hurts for me, to see you turn to stone
Oh I will comfort you, yes I will.

What friends are for is still what I believe
Turn me away, you know I wouldn't leave
Oh I will see you through

Don't you be afraid
Some things you just know
Until your feet are on the shore
I won't let you go
You can't see through the storm
And love is out of sight
When someone tears your heart in two
And throws it into the night, oh I'll

Take the time, I know that is all you need
I don't have the heart to see you bleed
And I will do anything to maje it right, yes I will

Don't you be afraid
Some things you just know
Until your feet are on the shore
I won't let you go
You can't see through the storm
And love is out of sight
When someone tears your heart in two
And throws it into the night, oh I'll
