I heard what I said to you,
And it was so out of sync
With the way I wanted to
Make myself out to seem.
I don't like this air,
But that doesn't mean I'll stop breathing it,
Who doesn't think they're at the center of the universe being it?

Don't look now,
Just keep watching your TV,
Hating what's to see,
Waiting for someone to say something that's right!

I heard what I said to you,
Thought it was all understood,
But I wasn't getting through,
I'd go on if I could.
I don't like this air,
But that doesn't mean I'll stop breathing it,
Who doesn't think they're at the center of the universe being it?

Don't look now,
Just keep watching your TV,
Hating what's to see,
Waiting for someone to say something that's right!
