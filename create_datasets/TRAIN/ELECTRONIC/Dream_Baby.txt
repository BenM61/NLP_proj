This is like a dream
This is like a dream baby
Too many sleepless nights staring into nowhere
Too many silent cries trap me in this nightmare
I close my eyes and try to find someone to talk to
And there you are, I see your face, I put my arms around you
Be my Dream Baby
Come on, dream on, come on, come on!
Too many passive dreams taking us to nowhere
Too many voices tell us this is not a love affair
I close my eyes and try to find someone to talk to
And there you are, I see your face, I put my arms around you
Too many sleepless nights staring into nowhere
Too many voices tell us this is not a love affair
Too many passive dreams taking us to nowhere
Too many silent cries trap me in this nightmare
And there you are, I see your face
I try, I try to find someone to talk to
I try, Itry to find someone, to find someone
Be my Dream Baby
