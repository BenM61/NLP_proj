Watch me overcome what I'm running from
And change the tune so I let it go
What matters now is story soon
I get up, try my luck, it starts to call on me
Never sure how it feels so let it rain on me

In the meantime, you're in between time

What I care to see, lay you hands on me
And just for now, let me bury too
What is scaring you? Six feet underground

Got a whole bag of trouble to be taken away
And my veins keep throbbin' when I'm out on display
Couldn't this be the moment to discover my intentions?
Will you ever? May be never take me away to be closer
