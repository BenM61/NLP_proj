All I did today was wake up and watch TV
Another wasted day
But that's alright with me
When shadows turn to clouds
Good choices won't be made
Until tomorrow comes
But that's alright with me

I will stand and wait until it's morning
And I won't make it lying down
I will close my eyes, so I can't see you
And I will have all my chances again
I want all of my chances again

And as the sky turns red
The street lights coming on
I could stay up all night or go to bed
Oh, neither's right or wrong
Until tomorrow comes
Until tomorrow comes

I will stand and wait until it's morning
And I won't make it lying down
I will close my eyes so I can't see you
And I will have all my chances again
I want all of my chances again

I will stand
I will stand

I will stand and wait until it's morning
And I won't make it lying down
I will close my eyes, so I can't see you
And I will have all my chances again
I want all of my chances again
