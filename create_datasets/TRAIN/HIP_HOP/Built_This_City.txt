We built this city
We built this city
We built this city
We built this city on rock

We built this city (on these blocks we hustle)
We built this city on rock (on rock)
We built this city (turn bricks to whips)
We built this city on rock and roll (on rock)
We built this city (in the midst of the struggle)
We built this city on rock (on rock)
We built this city (from bottom to top)
We built this city (through the agony and pain, diplomatic will reign)

Ay yo, my dipset Taliban
We on these streets like the wars on them streets of Afghanistan
Better yet of Pakistan
To America, Harlem's our cater
Any problems I spray her that can startle the mayor
But in this 50-block radius let's get the rock and shave the shit
or get the glock and blaze the shit
Bitches get the cock and savor it
They say Jim Jones the capo my favorite
Cause some of this shit my city wasn't built up over
Drugs and money, some shit you get killed up over
Slumped on your wheel, straight tilt it over
Trust me dogs, I seen it in peril
Niggaz wasted and painted and seen on the mural
(That's Harlem) In this apple of mine is rhyme
Clap up your shines, pop shots that will crack up your minds
And cop rocks and cook that crack up to dimes
New York City, the capital of crime


Now once again it's Santana the Great
I built this city on hammers and weight
Gasoline, rope, bandanas and tape
Lots of fiends, lots of coke being handed away
You know, the usual
Shut em down, set up show, how we usually do
Cut em down, hit the block man, we movin through
Diplomats is the strongest force
On and off the court we ballers more than sports
We built this city from ground zero
To spittin the pound zero, brown pistol
At ya get down kicka
Yeah this is from the ground up nigga
So get your weight and your pounds up nigga
Cause when it's beef my homies mound up quicker
Fit the pound much quicker, lay you down much quicker
You never been approached by Golden Eagles
Vultures that will scope and feed you, no court just leave you
Shit you know


It's like what I wouldn't do for a buck
My enemies can't rest in peace Jones, you see they funerals up
New gangstas in the city bitch, ring the alarm
All y'all hoes bow down, kiss the ring of a don
It's about to get real big playa, humongous
Stacked money so long til it grew fungus
We was gon' let you live til you threw punches
Now we got to get critical and we got to get rid of you
And we the most talked about, the most popular
We live by the codes, we the Dipset mafia
You never know who's watchin ya
You never know who's plottin to pop at ya
We focused like a pair of binoculars
I'm bout to get gritty
M-5 CLK's garage look like Alphabet City
And I'm a hustler, I put cracks in communities
Cops can't touch me, got Diplomatic Immunity
Now try I'm guaranteed a million shipped in scam
If not, back to the block, ship some grams

If not, get with Cam
I got clips to lift a van, flip a van
Shit, they can kick the can
This cat think he sling
Cause he got a pinky ring
Rinky-dink diamonds, they don't even make your pinky bling
(We built this city) And now I'm about to kill this city
(We built this city) Cradle to 50, yeah I'm acting real seditty
(We built this city) Cause I collect mils and fifties
For real it's pretty and y'all gonna feel the pity
(We built this city on rock) Dipset Bitch
