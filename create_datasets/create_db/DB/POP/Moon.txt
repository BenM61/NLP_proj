Know what the sun feels like on my skin
I wanna know what the moon feels like within
I know what the sun feels like on my skin
I wanna know how the moon gives life within

And the same moon rises so far of me as you
And there is not really much about that we can do
I see the light and your bright keeps me up all night
I see the light and your bright keeps me up all night

The world that I'd known is seen by the light of the moon
And there is light that I can only want more then I do?
And there is light that I can only feel when I'm with you
And the same moon rises so far of me as you,
And there is really not much about that we can do
No, there is really not much about that we can do

I see the light and your bright keeps me up all night
I feel the light burning bright
I see the light and your bright keeps me up all night
Keeps me up all night
Keeps me up all night

And I listen to the grass grow
And I wonder what I don't know
And I listen to the grass grow
And I wonder what I don't know
And it's really not much about that that I can't do

The same moon rises so far of me as you
I see the light and your bright keeps me up all night
I see the light and your bright keeps me up all night
I feel the light brightening up (keeps me up all night)
I feel the light (keeps me up all night) and your bright keeps me up all night
