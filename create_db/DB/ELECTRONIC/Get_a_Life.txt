We are working in the moonlight
Breathing in the cool night air
Trying to holding on the summer time
Plain to see and straight ahead
We are diving into wilderness
Digging hand in dirt
Looking for a couple bucks
Having a game for what its worth

Through the fires and the chains
We are gonna getting a life out of this
The shine of light upon our way
Is making it a life out of this

Through the fires and the chains
We are gonna getting a life out of this
The shine of light upon our way
Is making it a life out of this

We make the road by walking
Find a place that is right
Which keeps us from falling
Out of reach and out of sight
We are going fishing for diamonds
Be about to leave this town
Go for broke, another round
And the big wheel ain't turned us down

Through the fires and the chains
We are gonna getting a life out of this
The shine of light upon our way
Is making it a life out of this

Through the fires and the chains
We are gonna getting a life out of this
The shine of light upon our way
Is making it a life out of this

Through the fires and the chains
We are gonna getting a life out of this
The shine of light upon our way
Is making it a life out of this

Through the fires and the chains
We are gonna getting a life out of this
The shine of light upon our way
Is making it a life out of this

Through the fires and the chains
We are gonna getting a life out of this
The shine of light upon our way
Is making it a life out of this

Through the fires and the chains
We are gonna getting a life out of this
The shine of light upon our way
Is making it a life out of this
