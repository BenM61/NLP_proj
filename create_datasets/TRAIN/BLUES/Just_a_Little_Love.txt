Some people die for hate
Some die for love
Some die because
They don't have a mate

But all I want
All I want is a little love
All I've ever wanted, people
All I want is just a little love

All I want a little bit of love
All I want is a little bit of love
All I want is just a little bit of love

Everybody say the world is large
But to me it's very small
Out of all of these women
I can't find no true love at all
All I want is just a little love
All I've ever wanted, mmm
Is just a little love

All I want is a little bit of love
All I want is a little bit of love
I say, all I want is just a little bit of love

All I want is a little bit of love
All I need is a little bit of love
All I want is just a little bit of love
