If I told a lie, if I made you cry
When I said goodbye, I'm sorry
From the bottom of my heart, dear
I apologize
If I caused you pain, I know I'm to blame
Must have been insane, believe me
From the bottom of my heart, dear
I apologize
I realize I've been unfair to you
Please let me make amends
Don't say that you forgot the love we knew
After all, we were more than friends
If I made you blue, I've had heartaches too
Now I beg of you, forgive me
From the bottom of my heart, dear
I apologize
Give me back your glance, give me back romance
Give me one more chance, forgive me
From the bottom of my heart, dear
I apologize
