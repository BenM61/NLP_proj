We met one magicsummer day
A dream cametrue and blew a way
For as your love began to grow
The time had come for me to go
Now all that Iam living for
Is to comeback to you once more

Lovely lady of Arcadia
Promise you will wait for me
In your arms I found my shangrila
And it's where Ilo long to be
Lost in love eternally

I feel alone amongthe crowds
And sunny skies are filled with clouds
I miss your kiss and you embrace
The empting smile that lights your face
And just aslong as we're a part
The same old song will haunt my heart

Lovely lady of Arcadia
Promise you will wait for me
In your arms I found my Shangrila
And it's where Ilo long to be
Lost in love eternally
