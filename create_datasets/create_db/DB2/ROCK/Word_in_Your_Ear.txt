It's yours if you want it,
No-one's berating me.
Try not to feel so afraid,
It's your move, angel,
It's all there, in you.

A word in your ear,
There's reason to get through,
Yesterday's never ahead of you.
Carry yourself,
Foreclose your enemy,
I'm not worthy of you now and I'll never be.
