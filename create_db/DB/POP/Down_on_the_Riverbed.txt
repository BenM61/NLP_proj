Down on the riverbed
Down on the riverbed
Down on the riverbed
I asked my lover for her hand
A red tailed hawk circled overhead
A red tailed hawk circled overhead
A red tailed hawk circled overhead
The church on the hill, was what she said
A monster cloud like a big black hen
A monster cloud like a big black hen
A monster cloud like a big black hen
As she drew houses in the sand
Down on the riverbed
Down on the riverbed
Down on the riverbed
I asked my lover for her hand
I asked my lover for her hand
Then I heard a train whistle blow
Then I heard a train whistle blow
Then I heard a train whistle blow
And I knew it was time to go
Down on the riverbed
Down on the riverbed
Down on the riverbed
I asked my lover for her hand
I asked my lover for her hand
I asked my lover for her hand
I asked my lover for her hand
