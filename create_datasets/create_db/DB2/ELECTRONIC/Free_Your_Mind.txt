Waiting in the hole for rescue
Gotta have faith, you'll be near
Darkness side has come to test you
You know he will succeed if the act is won
Riches of the world are for you
Gotta fill the souls of your daughters and sons

Oh, shine brother, shine on
Oh, shine brother like the sun
Oh, gotta float and shine on
All you got to do is hold on
If your head is heavy just stand up straight
In these arms you're always welcome
If you are a sinner or you are a saint
Oh, shine brother, shine on
Oh, shine brother like the sun

Love, free your mind
Free your mind
Free your mind

You gotta reach the sky
If you want your life to shine
You gotta reach the sky
If you want your life to shine
Free your mind

Waiting for a hope to rescue
Gotta have faith, you'll be near
Darkness side has come to test you
You know he will succeed if the act is won
Oh, shine brother, shine on
Oh, shine brother like the sun

Love, free your mind
Free your mind
Free your mind

When your heart is gone
Who will guide us?
When you say you can't, 'til he will find us
When you can't go on
You'll be feeling ugly
Oh baby just reach out
When your eyes aren't looking

You gotta reach the sky
If you want your life to shine
You gotta reach the sky
If you want your life to shine

Free your mind
Free your mind
Free your mind
Free your mind
Free your mind
Free your mind
Free your mind
Free your mind
