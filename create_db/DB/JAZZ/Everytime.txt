Every time I see my baby passin' by
Everytime I feel just like I wanna cry.
If I said I didn't love her,
I must have told a lie.

Everytime she's walkin' with some other man.
Everytime I see him reach to hold her hand,
I wonder how long will I suffer, I wonder how much can I stand.

Anytime I hear my Baby call my name
Anytime, I make everything the same.
If I don't get you back baby,
I've only myself to blame.
