It's so hot in here
It's burning outside
And all your teenage idols
Have left the building
Haven't you seen the signs of the time?
Where do you want to go?
Where do you want to go now?
Are you the last to know?
They've changed your future
Where do you want to go?
Where do you want to go now?
Where do you want to go today?
It's so hot in here
It's burning outside
Everybody's leaving
Say they will make it on the other side
Haven't you seen the signs of the time?
Where do you want to go?
Where do you want to go now?
Are you the last to know?
They've changed your future
Where do you want to go?
Where do you want to go now?
Where do you want to go today?
