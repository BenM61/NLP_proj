Gonna be my baby
You have got to love someone
Gonna be my lover
Girl I'm telling everyone
Gonna be my baby
I can't treat you like a friend
I can't treat you like a friend 

Thank you for the love
And then I want to say
Thank you for the dream
I want to get away
Thank you for your help
And now I want to stay
Thank you for the love
Thank you for the love

Gimme hope and gimme shelter
That I have lost along the road
Hand in hand we'll walk together
And you know you're not alone
Thank you for the time, grateful it will be
Thank you for the life you spent with me
Welcome to my dream and I want to say
Thank you for the love
Thank you for the love
