Think I'm here for all the wrong reasons
Can't do it wrong, when you don't do a thing
Once in love, it's more like a habit
Guess that's what I need to feel like me

I'm gonna stay with you
I'm gonna stay with you
I'm gonna stay with you
There's nothing else to do

I'm gonna stay with you
I'm gonna stay with you
I'm gonna stay with you
There's nothing else to do

I'm gonna stay with you
I'm gonna stay with you
I'm gonna stay with you
There's nothing else to do

I'm gonna stay with you
I'm gonna stay with you
I'm gonna stay with you
There's nothing else to do

I'm gonna stay with you
I'm gonna stay with you
I'm gonna stay with you
Let's not try to talk this through
