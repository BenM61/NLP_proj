I must write a letter to you
I must make myself clear
It is spot on time, right on cue
I am a clam, somebody said to me
It's obscene, there must be a motive behind
It's obscure. there must be someone behind

A muscovite mosquito, a muscovite mosquito
A muscovite mosquito, a muscovite mosquito

A vivid image anyway
Someone said, you're a clam,
Consider this !

Mmm, listen oh, listen to me, you're far
A thousand miles away from here
I am here, I am here in this ooze through country
Trampled down by mega people
A dispute will never end
A retrospection ,it sounds obscene
A disconnection,
A final balance sheet for muscovite mosquito
For muscovite mosquito
For muscovite mosquito, it sound obscene
It sound so obscure, for muscovite mosquito
My final balance sheet is gone...... for
Muscovite mosquito, muscovite mosquito
It's spot on time, right on cue
You missed the chance, somebody vexedly said
It's obscene, there must be motives behind
It's obscure, there must be someone behind
