When you feel like you need someone there
Feel like no one really cares
Call me on the telephone
I'll be there

When you feel like you really need love
I'll always be by your side
Call me on the telephone
I'll be there

Everyone needs someone to love
Call me, I'll give you love

[Chorus]
When you feel like you need someone there
Feel like no one really cares
Call me on the telephone
I'll be there

We'll share a love that will never end
Lean on me and I'll be your friend
In your darkest hour I'll be your light
Like a star shining in the night

Call me on the telephone
I'll be there

Everyone needs someone to love
Call me, and I'll give you love
In my heart, you'd have a home
But I'll never leave you alone

[Chorus]

When you feel like you really need love
I'll always be by your side
Call me on the telephone
I'll be there

[Chorus]
