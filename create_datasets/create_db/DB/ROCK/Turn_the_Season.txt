Things go up and then go down, chase a smile with a frown. 
He knows that his joy will stop, waiting for the other shoe to drop. 
He's a ship on the sea, setting sail to perfidy. 
He is cold, he is warm, he's the peace inside the storm. 
Feel the swelling of a wave, hear the ringing of a bell, 
He's been weak and he's been brave, he's been to heaven and he's been to hell. 
See the old in the new, see the life stretch before you, 
See a mother in the child, there was youth behind grey eyes. 
I don't know him anymore, he isn't like he was before. 
A stone is taken by the tide, another season on the other side. 
Like the spinning of a wheel, he'll be hurt but he will heal. 

There's a flower in the weeds, there's a life inside the seed. 
(And he said) "I have never been as happy as I am today", 
(But then the seasons turned and the darkness came) 
"So when it all falls apart I will have peace in my heart" 
(Try to think of the healing that comes out of the pain). 
"Try to redeem myself for mistakes in advance", 
(The sun will always shine after the rain) 
"I know that when I fall down I'll get another chance" 
(Just wipe away the tears and try again). 

We couldn't see without the dark, thing's wouldn't end without a spark. 
There is no truth without lies and no future without memories. 
He's in the middle of the road, from where he's been and where he'll go. 
He's the forest kissed by flames, the trees die so they can grow again. 
He knows that death is part of life, he would have made that girl his wife. 
Now there's only darkness, there is no dawn, now that she's gone. 

(And he said) "I have never been as happy as I am today", 
(but then the seasons turned and the darkness came) 
"So when it all falls apart I will have peace in my heart" 
(Try to think of the healing that comes out of the pain). 
"Try to redeem myself for mistakes in advance", 
(The sun will always shine after the rain) 
"I know that when I fall down I'll get another chance" 
(Just wipe away the tears and try again).
