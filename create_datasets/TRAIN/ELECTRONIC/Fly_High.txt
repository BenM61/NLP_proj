I feel like I am flying so free up in the sky,
Like I'm diving in the air,
I fly high, the way you want it.
(Oooooooh) Just gotta, the way you want it.
(Oooooooh) Just gotta, the way you want it.
Don't trip on the people that walk around you now,
Just keep looking ahead cruisin',
And glide on, until you find it.
(Oooooooh) Just gotta, the way you want it,
(Oooooooh) Just gotta, in this limitless sky,
(Oooooooh) Just gotta.
Full speed ahead now, open the window,

This is a weird-ass place, I'm in so weird a place,
Tripping out passing time,
Its wonderful place to free your mind up in the sky, 
I'm content to keep on flying.
I feel like I am flying so free up in the sky,
Like I'm diving in the air,
I fly high, the way you want it.
(Oooooooh) Just gotta, the way you want it
(Oooooooh) Just gotta, in this limitless sky,
(Oooooooh) Just gotta, the way you want it,
(Oooooooh) Just gotta.
