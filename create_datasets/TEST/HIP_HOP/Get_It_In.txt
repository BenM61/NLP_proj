Walk up in the club and I got two dimes on my arms
Haters are grillin' but they ain't gon' do no harm
So, let me do what I came to do
I got, to but I'm lookin' fo' a whole new crew
Who used to, doin' it the way I do
And if you're ugly I ain't fuckin' wit'chu
Pimpin' ain't easy but if it's wrong I don't wanna be right
I'm leavin' here with plenty of 'em tonight
It's Black-Ty with the M-E-T-H-O-D, Man

Understand I'm a grown ass man in the buildin'
Hoes catch feelings cause they love how I get it in

Last poet with that "Heron" but this time, I'm shootin' that get
Check my paperwork, I'm movin' legit

Oh yeah it's Wu bitch, pass me a spliff
Staten Island back in the mix, big boss nigga crackin' the whip
Ain't no problem, I'm a master at this
These silly rappers is really actors who swag jackers yappin' they lips
(John John!) Next MC, I believe that's me
Top model in the bottle of V-S-O-P

Platinum status, official hoe mag-a-net
Fake thugs with Don Juan jux, I'm not havin' it
You find me up in V.I.P.
Chillin' in the back with a sexy-ass Puerto Rican mami
Watch me get busy up on these hoes
And my niggas got ten apiece, we ready to go

Yeah, yeah, Method Man and Black-Ty
"Is niggas that fly?" Man do peas got black eyes?
Bitch recognize, grab your purse and let's ride
Look at Mr. Meth with your ex in the Rex-5
Man I can't lie, be advised big pimpin' about to start
If this chick wanna back-talk, errt, get out and walk
Don't slick talk, with women I like 'em feminine
Skin color cinnamon, mami now gon' get it in (get it in)
