If I go a million miles away
I'd write a letter each and every day
'Cause honey, nothin',
Nothin' can ever change this love
I have for you

Ooh, make me weep
You can make me cry
See me comin'
And you can pass me by
But honey, nothin',
Nothin' can ever change this love
I have for you

Oh, you're the apple of my eye
You're cherrie pie
And oh, you're, you're cake and ice cream
Oh, you're sugar and spice
And everything nice
You're the girl of my, my, my, my dreams

If you wanted to leave me
And roam
When you get back
I'd just say
Welcome home,
'Cause honey, nothin'
Nothin', nothin' can ever change this
Love I have for you

Oh
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know that nothin'
Nothin', nothin', can ever change the love I have for you
