I raise my head in a touchy situation
(Mr. Skin you know where you've been)
Yes, I make my bed in the heart of the nation
(Mr. Skin you know where you've been)

I know it's a trait human love
To make all the people holler
Na, na, na
Na, na, na
Na, na, na

Send them lookin' out for their woman
Send them reachin' out for their dollar
Na, na, na
Na, na, na
Na, na, na, hey, hey

Oh, I'm rollin' flowin' through the whole population
(Mr. Skin you know where you've been)
Oh, the high and the low born are my friends and relations
(Mr. Skin you know where you've been)

I can bring you pain
I can bring you sudden pleasure
Na, na, na
Na, na, na
Na, na, na

Your life will only gain
If your loves final measure
Na, na, na
Na, na, na
Na, na, na, ooh

I'm Mr., Mr. Skin
(Mr. Skin you know where you've been)
I'm Mr., Mr. Skin
(Mr. Skin you know where you've been)
I'm Mr., Mr. Skin
(Mr. Skin you know where you've been)

I'm Mr., Mr. Skin
(Mr. Skin you know where you've been)
I'm Mr., Mr. Skin
(Mr. Skin you know where you've been)
I'm Mr., Mr. Skin
(Mr. Skin you know where you've been)
