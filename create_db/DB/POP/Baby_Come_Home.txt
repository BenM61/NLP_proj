I don’t mind
If you’re running around
Givin’ someone the time
It’s alright
Cause I know that you love me
I’m layin’ in bed with a whole lot of wonder
Going through my head
This ‘don’t give a f*ck’
Gets a little bit lonely
But I’m too cool to lose my control
You’re too cool to call
Maybe I just don’t want to know
You’re out there having it all

Baby come home to me
Baby come home to me
It’s a half past quarter-to-three
Baby come home to me
I said I’m not that kind of guy
But you bout to see a grown man cry
Baby come home to me
Baby come home

Maybe one more pill
Will help me close my eyes
To the pain I feel
I can’t sleep
Unless you’re laying beside me
I’ve got no doubt
That you’d be just fine
If you were livin’ without me
But I just can’t let you start it tonight
9 10 11 now midnight strikes
I don’t know where you been
But I still wanna make love tonight
When you come stumbling in

Baby come home to me
Baby come home to me
It’s a half past quarter-to-three
Baby come home to me
I said I’m not that kind of guy
But you ‘bout to see a grown man cry
Baby come home to me
Baby come home

Baby what do I do
Just to keep from tearin’ in 2
Baby what could you say
To drive my fears away
Maybe one red letter day
There’ll be no more chips to play
When you come home
Baby come home

Baby come home to me
Baby come home to me
It’s a half past quarter-to-three
Baby come home to me

Baby come home to me
Baby come home to me
It’s a half past quarter-to-three
Baby come home to me
I said I’m not that kind of guy
But you ‘bout to see a grown man cry
Baby come home to me
Baby come home
