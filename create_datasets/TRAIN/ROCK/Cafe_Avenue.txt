I was feeling hungry
I didn't have no money, no
But I was like you'd say "off the hook"
And sometimes it hit me quite hard
Started searching
For what I don't know
I suppose I started searching
Searching for money and fame
Yes I wild, wild, wild, wild
Through the night sometimes
Blind, blind, blind until it was light
But it was my life
I got prostituted
I just had to get some money, why know
But let me tell you
The more I got the faster it went
Sometimes there in the danger
Of not getting paid
(But) Sometimes I was out all night
Offering the service I gave
Yes I was, yes I was wild, wild, wild, wild
Through the night sometimes
Blind, blind, blind until it was light
Cafe Avenue. I'm comin' back to you once more
To see the same old fools and freaks
Sitting at the same old tables (yeah)
Cafe Avenue, I'm comin' back to you once more
You still remember how bad (bad)
Things were once before
It makes no difference how you are
It makes no difference how you look
In the Cafe Avenue
But now I've found a shelter
And things have turned out much better, yeah
Oh let me tell you
Nowadays
It's so easy to look back
