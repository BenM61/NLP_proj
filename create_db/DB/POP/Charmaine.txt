Waiting just for-or-or you
Charmai-ai-ai-ai-ai-aine

I wonder why you keep me wai-ai-aiting
Charmai-aine (my Charmaine)
Rise in vai-ai-ain (rise in vain)
I wonder when bluebirds are mating
Will you come back agai-ai-ain
And I wonder if I keep on praying
Will our dreams be the same (be the same)
I wonder if ever you think of me too
I'm waiting, my Charmaine, for you

Just for you
I'm waiting, my Charmaine, for you...
