I ain't hanging up this time
I ain't giving up tonight
Even if you walk around
As though you think you're right
At your worst you still believe
It's worth the fight

I could make it all go away
Tell me what you think and don't delay
We could still be having some
Sweet memories
This heart still beats for you
Why can't you see?

Shut up, kiss me, hold me tight
Shut up, kiss me, hold me tight
Stop your crying, it's alright
Shut up kiss me, hold me tight

Stop pretending I'm not there
When it's clear I'm not going anywhere
If I'm out of sight then take another look around
I'm still out there hoping to be found

Shut up, kiss me, hold me tight
Shut up, kiss me, hold me tight
Stop your crying, it's alright
Shut up, kiss me, hold me tight
Shut up, kiss me, hold me tight

I could make it all disappear
You could feed me all of your fears
We could end all this pain right here
We could rewind all of those tears

I could take it down to the floor
You don't have to feel it anymore
A love so real that it can't be ignored
It's all over, baby, but I'm still young
I'm still young

Shut up, kiss me, hold me tight
Shut up, kiss me, hold me tight
Stop your crying, it's alright
Shut up, kiss me, hold me tight
Shut up, kiss me, hold me tight
