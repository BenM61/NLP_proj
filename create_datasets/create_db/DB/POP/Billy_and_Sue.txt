This is a story about Billy and Sue
They were in love as any other two
But Billy had to die
And when you hear the reason why
You'll hang your head and cry

Billy and Sue met the first day of school
And ever since lived by the golden rule
When you do unto others
What you wouldn't want done to you
You'd have to be a fool

Mutual agreement led to love and trust
They would travel the road to marriage or bust
But when Billy was old enough to take a wife
He was old enough to fight for his country
And his way of life

Sue's letters came every day
Gave him the strength to show him the way
To fight for his country and the girl he loved
That's a soldier's only fate

Then Billy heard no word from Sue
He was worried sick but what could he do
The bullets were flying as he hugged the ground and back home
Sue was running round

Billy was growing less and less strong
His hope his faith was almost gone
Then like a miracle a letter appeared
Billy tore the letter open and he read
Dear John

A look came over Billy that would scare a ghost
Familiar look seen on soldiers coast to coast
Even though the air was filled with lead
Billy jumped up
They shot him dead

Billy was buried in a faraway grave that read
For his country his life he gave
But the epitaph was only a part
He didn't die from a bullet but he died
From a broken heart
