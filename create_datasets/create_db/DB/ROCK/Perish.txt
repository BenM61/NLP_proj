There's a ghost in my house,
I realize it's you,
You I see through,
You were right,
We don't know each other.

We're staying together for the sake of our memories,
That we love and cherish we can't let them down.

Surely our souls will perish,
Surely our souls will perish.

There's a ghost in my heart,
I'm not willing to free,
It symbolizes me,
But I'm not ready,
I'm scared of the bugs,
A millionth of the size of me.

We're staying together for the sake of our memories,
That we love and cherish we can't let them down.

Surely our souls will perish,
Surely, surely, surely, 
We're staying together for the sake of our memories,
That we love and cherish we can't let them down,
We're staying together for the sake of our memories,
That we love and cherish we can't let them down,
Down.

I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared.
I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared.

We're staying together for the sake of our memories,
That we love and cherish we can't let them down,
We're staying together for the sake of our memories,
That we love and cherish we can't let them down

Surely our souls will perish,
Surely our souls will perish,
Surely our souls will perish,
Surely, surely, surely, surely, surely, surely.
