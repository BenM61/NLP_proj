In the eye of eyes
The mind of minds
We paint the truth
And then defend it
Meet yourself
Find your hell
But keep believing
You've got the answers

Climb inside the mirror
Backward the words
"Darkness is a perspective"
And we've got our heads in dirt

I've been watching the ego work
I've been watching the ego work

A toxic tongue
A song unsung
We know the signs
We know possession
Feel the rage
Manipulate us

Just beyond the looking glass
Down the tunnel, go ask Alice
Tender nerves spin the earth
We've got our heads in dirt

I've been watching the ego work
I've been watching the ego work

Climb inside the mirror
Backward the words
"Darkness is a perspective"
And we've got our heads in dirt

I've been watching the ego work
I've been watching the ego work
I've been watching the ego work
I've been watching the ego work
