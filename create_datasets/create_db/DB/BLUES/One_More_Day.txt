One mo' day
One mo' day I been alone
One mo' day
One mo' day I been alone
Got a letter from my baby
Sayin' she's on her way back home

Why don't ya call me, baby
Sayin' you bringin' yo' clothes back home?
Why don't ya call me, baby
Sayin' you bringin' yo' clothes back home?
You know I'm crazy 'bout you, baby
But you been gone away too long
