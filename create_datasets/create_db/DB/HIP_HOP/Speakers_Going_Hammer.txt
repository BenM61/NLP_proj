I wake up early in the morning
Round the crack of dawning
Wave to my neighbors like wassup (say wassup)
And I'm all tatted up, dat bang in my trunk
Everybody in ma city show me love
Because I got my speakers going hammer, bammer bammer bammer
Speakers going hammer, speakers going hammer?
Speakers going hammer, bammer bammer bammer
Speakers going hammer, speakers going hammer?

My speakers out of space like ET
Cops watch me all day like TV
SOD hit da club we be so deep
Mine on D and I grind like a OG
I got twelve diamond chains like a Ozzy
Follow me like de wizard of Oz
Girls love my style cuz it is so neat
Ask about me in da streets I spit so heat
Ain't nobody in da game messing with my click
Style swift hot like itz July 10th
Fly chick in my whip with nice tits
Her boyfriend paid for it, I didn't
Ice game, cold as a polar bear
Sun hit my chain, watch it make a solar flare
We gettin money over here hands in the air
Ya'll making it too easy!, it's not fair

I wake up early in the morning
Round the crack of dawning
Wave to my neighbors like wassup (say wassup)
And I'm all tatted up, dat bang in my trunk
Everybody in ma city show me love
Because I got my speakers going hammer, bammer bammer bammer
Speakers going hammer, speakers going hammer?
Speakers going hammer, bammer bammer bammer
Speakers going hammer, speakers going hammer?

I remember back in the days mane I was broke
These days soulja tell em run a hundred spokez
No joke, mane I'm balling out the atmosphere
Say you ball harder then me, man get em outta here
I gotta my speakers going hamm in my Lamborghini
Two door coupe, girl in bikini
Passenger seat and she five star she so swagg
She so fabulous they way she throw it in the bag
Its young soulja soulja mane I swear I'm popping tags
Back then, you could catch me in a poniac
These days drop top Phantom with a hundred stackz
Yea they buy this album but they want they money back
Girls wet like they living in a fish tank
I'm getting money man what the f*ck a bitch think
Young soulja got my speakers going MC Hammer
Like Rick Ross bitch I think I'm MC Hammer

Hey! Yea! Yea!
Say wassup
Hey! Yea! Yea!
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!(Show me love)

I wake up early in the morning
Round the crack of dawning
Wave to my neighbors like wassup (say wassup)
And I'm all tatted up, dat bang in my trunk
Everybody in ma city show me love
Because I got my speakers going hammer, bammer bammer bammer
Speakers going hammer, speakers going hammer?
Speakers going hammer, bammer bammer bammer
Speakers going hammer, speakers going hammer?
