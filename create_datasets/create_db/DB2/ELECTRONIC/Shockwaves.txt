Blood pressure's rising
Can't catch my breath
Every time I hear footsteps coming nearer
These strange vibrations
I can't resist
The feeling scares me so
I lose control

My head is shaking
And my knees are weak
I feel the ground moving under me

You're sending,
You're sending me shockwaves, shockwaves
You're sending,
You're sending me shockwaves, shockwaves

This strong sensation
Is burning in me
Every time I hear you whisper in my ear
Got to have hold of my heart
Like gravity, I can't try to hide it
No way to fight it

My hands are shaking
And my knees are weak
I feel the ground moving under me

You're sending,
You're sending me shockwaves, shockwaves
You're sending,
You're sending me shockwaves, shockwaves
You're sending,
You're sending me shockwaves, shockwaves
You're sending me,
You're sending me shockwaves, shockwaves

Heaven knows I tried
To keep my sanity
But mama never told me
What a man like you could do to me

Hey, shockwaves
Hey, shockwaves

You're sending,
You're sending me shockwaves
You're sending,
You're sending me shockwaves
You're sending,
You're sending me shockwaves
You're sending,
You're sending me shockwaves
