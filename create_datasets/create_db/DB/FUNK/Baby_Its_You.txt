It's not the way you smile that touched my heart
It's not the way you kiss that tears my apart
But how many many many nights roll by
I sit alone at home and cry over you
What can I do
I can't help myself
'Cause baby it's you
Baby it's you
You should hear what they say about you (Cheat, cheat)
They say, they say you never never ever been true (Cheat, cheat)
Wo ho, it doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do, when it's true
Don't want nobody, nobody
'Cause baby it's you
Baby it's you
Wo ho how many many many nights roll by
I sit alone at home and cry over you
What can I do
Can't help myself, 
'Cause baby, it's you 
Baby, it's you
Don't leave me alone 
Come on home
