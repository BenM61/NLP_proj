Now watch this!
All the massive them come do culture move
This collaboration herewith is no ego trip
WE bring no badness no fuss or fighting with it
Educational why don't you keep up with this
Time to pay attention to the conscious lyriX
What them a do man what them chat about
The youth after nine o' clock can't stay out
Government man he a just a run up on his mouth
Hear! What him a say will happen without a doubt
Cannot think for himself, copy the American
To build up the tension bring the idea to Britain
Now! When the law is done he'll have his satisfaction
Then it will be for life for all youth, man and woman

Who goes there the original Asian Dub Foundation
Alongside Navigator on the M I see
Up here reality we talk and strictly culture
Culture on the move this year
HeyHeyHeyHeyHeyHeyHeyHeh...Asian Dub Foundation
HeyHeyHeyHeyHeyHeyHeyHey...

Kingdom 'gains kingdom and nation 'gains nation
Time we are living in it's called revelation
'cause when you take a stock of the whole situation
The elders them a poison the young generation
Instead of them trying to build a firm foundation
Them bring human beings down to pure degradation
With chemical warfare and nuclear weapons
Starvation, Sufferation, Dehumanisation
The world population have to take precautions
From pollution, corruption, infection, deception
Politicians claim that they've got the solution
But deep in their hearts they have a wicked intention
To rinse out poor people with tax and inflation
Segregating the massive, separating the nation
You think a so it goes
Why don't you answer my question
You better think again before they turn you a madman

All the massive in the place do culture move
All the massive in the place do culture move
This one is for all the microphone entertainers
You have the tool you have the talent to be an educator
Stop the slackness and tell them proper
Encourage the massive to become their own creator
Because in this time you have to understand
That the government man's going to try and mash up man plan
So direct the crowd and give them navigation
And believe you'll get a wicked reaction

HeyHeyHeyHeyHeyHeyHeyHey Asian Dub Foundation
Sound of the culture on the move
You better be conscious in everything that you do
