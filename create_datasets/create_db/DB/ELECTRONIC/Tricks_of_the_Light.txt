I'm half a crazy man
Waiting for a confirmation
Signs keep changing
I need some more information

Some tricks of the light
You never know
Make a flickering midnight light
Into a glow

It's a trick of the light
It's a trick of the light

Something tells me how
Her bright blue eyes are smiling
She turns her head now
Will she won't she deny him

Some tricks of the light
You never know
Make a flickering midnight light
Into a glow
And the spark that you saw so bright
Was just for show
Could it ever have turned out right
You'll never know

It's a trick of the light
It's a trick of the light

She turns she takes his hand
Breaking his concentration
She burns at his command
Makes some transfiguration

Some tricks of the light etc.
You never know
