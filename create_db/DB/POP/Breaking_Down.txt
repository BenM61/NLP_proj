All alone it was always there you see
And even on my own
It was always standing next to me
I can see it coming from the edge of the room
Creeping in the streetlight holding my hand in the pale gloom
Can you see it coming now?

Ah-ah, ah-ah I think I'm breaking down again
Ah-ah, ah-ah I think I'm breaking down

All alone even when I was a child
I've always known there was something to be frightened of
I can see it coming from the edge of the room
Creeping in the streetlight holding my hand in the pale gloom
Can you see it coming now?

Ah-ah, ah-ah I think I'm breaking down again
Ah-ah, ah-ah I think I'm breaking down

All alone on the edge of sleep
My old familiar friend
Comes and lies down next to me
And I can see it coming from the edge of the room
Smiling in the streetlight even with my eyes shut tight
I still see it coming now

Ah-ah, ah-ah I think I'm breaking down again
Ah-ah, ah-ah I think I'm breaking down again 
Ah-ah, ah-ah I think I'm breaking down again
Ah-ah, ah-ah I think I'm breaking down
