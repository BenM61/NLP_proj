We met when she was younger
And I had no eyes for her
A few years went by and I saw her
Now I'm gonna try for her

(Look out, baby)

She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once
She's not the little girl I once
She's not the little girl I once knew

How could I ever have known that
She'd be what she is today
An' look at how her boy friend holds her
I'll be movin' in one day

(split man)


(Bow, bow, bow) Laa-do-day,
(Bow, bow, bow) Laa-do-day,
(Bow, bow, bow) Laa-do-day,
(Bow, bow, bow)


She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once
She's not
