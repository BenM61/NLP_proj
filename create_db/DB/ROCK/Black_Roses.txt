Something special in my garden
I've been travelin' all over this world
I've been travelin' all over this world
I've never seen a black rose in any other garden
Something special in my garden

Black, black roses in my garden
Black, black roses in my garden
Black, black roses blooming in my garden
I got to keep good care for it
I got to water it

I've been travelin' all over this world
So you see
Something special in my garden

Black, black roses in my garden
Black, black roses blooming my garden
