I want a Sunday kind of love
A love that will last past Saturday night
And I've got to know it's more than love at first sight
I want a Sunday kind of love

I want a love that's on the square
Can't seem to find somebody, someone to care
And I'm on a lonely road that leads me nowhere
I need a Sunday kind of love

I do all my Sunday dreaming and all my Sunday scheming
Every minute, every hour, every day
And I'm hoping to discover a certain kind of lover
Who will show me the way

And my arms need someone to enfold, to keep me warm
When those Mondays and Tuesdays grow cold
And I need a love for all my life, to have and to hold
I want a Sunday kind of love, oh yeah

I don't want a Monday or a Tuesday
Wednesday or Thursday, Friday or Saturday
I don't want nothing baby
But I want a Sunday kind of love
