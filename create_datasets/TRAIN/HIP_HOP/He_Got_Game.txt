It might feel good 
It might sound a little somethin' 
But damn the game if it don't mean nothin' 
What is game who got game 
Where's the game in life behind the game behind the game 
I got game 
She's got game 
We got game 
They got game 
He got game 
It might feel good 
Or sound a little somethin'
But f*ck the game if it ain't saying nothin' 

If man is the father the son is the center of the earth 
In the middle of the universe 
Then why is this verse coming six times rehearsed 
I don't freestyle much but write 'em like such (word) 
Amongst times controlled by the screen 
What does it all mean all this shit I'm seeing 
Human beings screaming vocal javelins 
Sign of the local nigga unraveling 
My wonderin' got ass wonderin' 
Where Christ is in all this crisis 
Hating Satan never knew what nice is 
Check the paper while I bet on ices 
Keep more than your eye can see and ears can hear 
Year by year all the sense disappears 
Nonsense preserves prayers laced with fear 
Beware the two triple o is near 

There is something happening here 
What it is ain't exactly clear 
There's a man with a gun over there 
Tellin' me I got to beware 
It's time to stop children what's that sound 
Everybody look what's going down 

Thought of that millennium just be killing them 
It scary like lies buried in a library 
When did state pen correct anything 
When piles of us still be catchin' the bus 
When stacks of cash packed in laundromats 
Pay the preachers back where the teachers at 
I ain't even gotta ask it 
Whose underpaid and got fouled at the basket 
I can't blame the envy at who be getting all the benjis 
And taking them grants for granted 
Last I checked pyramids wasn't built like projects 
On them government checks 
Modern day thugs ain't got no guts 
Pardon the expression under governor nuts 
Last time in a church be the last time in a church 
Dead pledge allegiance to CD's and movies 
Leaving reality believing in fantasy 
Bleeding fatalities too many formalities 
Prayers laced with fear 
Beware the two trip zero is here 

It might feel good 
It might sound a little somethin' 
But damn the game if it don't mean nothin' 
What is game who got game 
Where's the game in life behind the game behind the game 
I got game 
She's got game 
We got game 
They got game 
He got game 
It might feel good 
Or sound a little somethin'
But f*ck the game if it ain't saying nothin'
