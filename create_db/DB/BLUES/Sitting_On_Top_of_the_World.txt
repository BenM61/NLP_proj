One summer day
She went away
She gone an left me
She gone to stay
But now she gone
An' I don't worry
'Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world

Works all the summer
And worked all the fall
I had to take my Christmas
In my over-halls*
But now she's gone
An' I don't worry
Because I'm sittin' on top of the world

Goin' down to the freight yard
Just to meet a freight train
I'm gon' leave this town
Work has done gotten too hard
But now she's gone
And I don't worry
Because I'm sittin' on top of the world

One summer day
She went away
She gone an left me
She gone to stay
But now she gone
And I don't worry
Because I'm sittin' on top of the world
