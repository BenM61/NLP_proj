We got the power to be loving each other
No matter what happens 
We've got the power to do that
On a le pouvoir de s'aimer, okay?
We got the power to be ringing the great bell out there above us
We got the power for that
We got the power to do that

And, we dream of home, I dream of life out of here
Their dreams are small
My dreams don't know fear (I got all you)
I got my heart full of hope
I will change everything
No matter what I'm told
How impossible it seems (we got the power)
We did it before
And we'll do it again
We're indestructible
Even when we're tired
And we've been here before
Just you and I
Don't try to rescue me
I don't need to be rescued

We got the power to be loving each other
No matter what happens 
We've got the power to do that
On a le pouvoir de s'aimer, okay?
We got the power to be ringing the great bell out there above us
We got the power for that
We got the power to do that

Get yourself up to the silent altar and call me
But don't forget the machines
'Cause if your choice is chipping it down on the M1 (1, 1, 1)
Then you'll wake up in the morning
You'll be storming, oh, oh, oh

We got the power to be loving each other
No matter what happens 
We've got the power to do that
On a le pouvoir de s'aimer, okay?
We got the power to be ringing the great bell out there above us
We got the power to do that
We got the power, power, power, power, power
We got the power
We got the power
