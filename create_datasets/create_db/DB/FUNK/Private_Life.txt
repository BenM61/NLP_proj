J'en ai marre of your theatrics,
Your acting's a drag,
It's ok on TV, but you can turn it off,

Your marriage is a tragedy,
But it's not my concern,
I'm very superficial I hate everything official,
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out,(x2)

Your sentimental gestures only bore me to death,
You've made a deaperate appeal, now save your breath,
Attachment to obligation, through guilt and regret, shit that's so wet

And your sex life complications are not my facinations,
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out,(x2) Oh!

You asked my advice I say use the door,
But your still clinging to somebody you deplore,
And now you want to use me for emotional blackmail,
I just feel pity when you lie, contempt when you cry,

Your private life drama, baby, leave me out,(x2) Oh!
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out,(x8)
