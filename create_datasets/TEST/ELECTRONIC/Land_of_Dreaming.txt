Everybody in the land of dreaming, everybody in the land of dreams 
Everybody in the land of dreaming, everybody in the land of dreams 
Oh oh living in the land of dreaming 
Oh oh living in the land of dreaming 

As I lay down to close my eyes 
Fantasy and inspiration flies 
I try to relax and to free my mind 
So I can leave everything behind 
Pictures circle round my head 
Some are good, some a bad 
I loose control as it seems 
And I start living in the land of dreams 

I'm moving on as I fall asleep 
My memories of love I try to keep 
I see a world of happiness 
There's no pain, there's no stress 
Children playing in the summer sun 
Dancing people having fun 
A world of love at it seems 
When you're living in the land of dreams
