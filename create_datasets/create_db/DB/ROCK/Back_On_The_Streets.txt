We've been out in the cold
Trying to get in
We've been ripped off and rolled
Heads in a spin

Nothing can stop us breaking through
Finding our way back home to you
Standing alone in the fight
You've never been out of our sight

We're back on the streets again 
We're back on our feet again
Out of the night
Into the light
We're back on our feet again
We're back, we're back on the streets again
We're back, we're back on the streets again

Caught in a crossfire
No-one can win
They bled off the power
Our spirit within
Standing our ground
We're digging in
This time round
We're gonna win
The banners are flying high
We're reaching for the sky

We're back on the streets again 
We're back on our feet again
Out of the night
Into the light
We're back on our feet again
We're back, we're back on the streets again
We're back, we're back on the streets again
