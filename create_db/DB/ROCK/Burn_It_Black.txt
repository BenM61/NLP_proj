I sow these streets with my own blood it seems
My soul is feeling unkempt and bare.
I'm just like you I'm complicated too.
Jealous knives in my back to spare.

I'll burn it black as sin, falling off the wagon again.
Burn it black as sin, lost my head.
You've got one shot left and now you're done
You'll turn your back on everyone
Burn it black as sin, time to

I feel your doors slam in my face 
Somehow I can't replace this lust that I've found.
I'm just like you my spirit's broken too.
Burn my bridges into the ground.
