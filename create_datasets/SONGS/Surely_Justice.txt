You got me thinking 'bout the law
Got me thinking 'bout the law
Got me thinking 'bout the law
Got me thinking 'bout the law
Got me thinking 'bout the law
Got me thinking 'bout the law
Got me thinking 'bout the law
Got me thinking 'bout the law

I got no heartbeat
Since I last saw you waving goodbye
I took the wrong train
Ended up in the centre of your mind

I sing to neighbours in a funny way
Hoping they will wonder why I smile
It's supertuesday on a Friday-night

Got me thinking 'bout the law
Got me thinking 'bout the law
Got me thinking 'bout the law
Got me thinking 'bout the law

I trade my handshake
For a night in the arms of the law
I meet the day-break
Telling God 'bout the miracles I saw

I walk for hours in a blurry state
Might as well be care-less for a while
It's love-transmission on a superday

I got no heart-beat
Since I last saw you waving goodbye
I took the fast train
And it felt like the law was on my side

You got me thinking 'bout the law
Got me thinking 'bout the law
Got me thinking 'bout the law
Got me thinking 'bout the law
Got me thinking 'bout the law
