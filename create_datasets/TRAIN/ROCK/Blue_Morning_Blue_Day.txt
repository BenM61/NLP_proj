Out in the street it's 6 am, another sleepless night
Three cups of coffee, but I can't clear my head from what went down last night
No we won't have our own little ways, but somehow we keep it together
You hear me talk, but you don't hear what I say, I guess it don't even matter
Blue morning, blue day, won't you see things my way?
Blue morning, can't you see what your love has done to me?
I've always listened to your point of view, my ways are cut through men
And I've always been a patient man, but my patience has reached its end
You tell me you're leaving, you tell me goodbye
You say you might send a letter
Well honey don't telephone, cause I won't be alone
I need someone to make me feel better

Blue morning, blue day, won't you see things my way?
Blue morning, can't you see what your love has done to me?
Blue morning, blue day, won't you see things my way?
Blue morning, can't you see what your love has done to me?
Blue morning, blue morning
Blue morning, blue morning
Blue morning, blue morning
Blue, blue, blue day, yeah
