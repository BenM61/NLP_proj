Can't see my face
In a looking glass, who was looking back, I can't decide
Can we take this track
Going deep beneath the clouds of sin, get on, get on...

Can't read this page
It was written on long before you had eyes to see
Can't find my way
I'm somewhere between Baton Rouge and New Orleans

This is our life, this is our time
You be yours and I'll be mine
This is our world, this is our time
And I'll see you...

Can't seem to explain
This need to plant deep inside bitter seed
Only if we escape
This city of sin built for you but its calling me in

This is our life, this is our time
You be yours and I'll be mine
This is our world, this is our time
And I'll see you...
Somewhere between then and now
We lost something, trying too hard
Somewhere between here and there
We forgot who we are

This is our life, this is our time
You be yours and I'll be mine
This is our world, this is our time
And I'll see you
