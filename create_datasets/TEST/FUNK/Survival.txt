Help me help me help me hold me help me
Survival well
Survival of the fittest
Survival
I a got get with it
'cause it ain't no joke (ain't no joke)
When a man is broke
Busted

Walkin' around broke
And it ain't no jive (ain't no jive)
Trying to stay alive (alive)
Livin' from day to day livin'
Rent man says that the rent is due
My little baby needs a new pair of shoes
I'm just about to loose my mind
One step away from the bread line
Well I'm tryna to do the very best I can
Tryin' a to make on through
I don't know which way to turn
I don't know what to do do do
Survival oh oh oh oh
Survival of the fittest
Survival
I a well I gotta get with it
'cause it ain't no joke (ain't no joke)
When a man is broke
Busted

Walking around broke
And it ain't no jive (ain't no jive)
Tryin' ta stay alive (alive)
Livin' from day to day livin'
Pockets are bare
I'm down to my last penny
Lookin' for folk
I can't find any
First law of nature is
Preservation of man
Look like I'll have to do
Anything I can
Hussle bussel day in day out
Can't even get a good night sleep
I don't know how in the world
We goin' make these ends meet
Survival I I I
Survival of the fittest
Survival I a
I gotta get with it
Cause it ain't no joke (ain't no joke)
When a man is broke
Walkin around with his hands in his pockets broke
Busted
And it ain't no jive (ain't no jive)
Tryin' to stay alive (alive)
Livin' from day to day livin'
Hussle bussel hang wit it
Got ta get it
Help me help help me help me help me
Oh survival
Survival of the fittest
Well well well
Survival of the fittest
Survival
I a well I gotta get with it
Survival
Well well well
Survival of the fittest

Survival wont I wonder does any body care
Wonder

Help me help me help
