I always flirt with death
I look ill but I don't care about it
I can face your threats and
Stand up straight and tall and shout about it

I think I'm on another world with you
With you
I'm on another planet with you
With you

You get under my skin
I don't find it irritating
You always play to win
But I won't need rehabilitating, oh no

I think I'm on another world with you
With you
I'm on another planet with you
With you
Another girl, another planet
Another girl, another planet

Space travel's in my blood
There ain't nothing I can do about it
Long journeys wear me out but
I know, I can't live without it oh no

I think I'm on another world with you
With you
I'm on another planet with you
With you

Another girl, who's loving you now
Another planet, who's holding you down
Another planet
