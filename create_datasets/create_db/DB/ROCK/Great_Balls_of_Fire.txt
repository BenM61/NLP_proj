You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain
Too much love drives a man insane
You broke my will, oh what a thrill
Goodness gracious great balls of fire

I learned to love all of Hollywood money
You came along and you moved me honey
I changed my mind, looking fine
Goodness gracious great balls of fire

You kissed me baby, woo, it feels good
Hold me baby, learn to let me love you like a lover should
You're fine, so kind
I'm a nervous world that your mine mine mine mine

I cut my nails and I twiddle my thumbs
I'm really nervous but it sure is fun
Come on baby, you drive me crazy
Goodness gracious great balls of fire

Well kiss me baby, woo-oooooo, it feels good
Hold me baby
I want to love you like a lover should
You're fine, so kind
I got this world that you're mine mine mine mine

I cut my nails and I twiddle my thumbs
I'm real nervous 'cause it sure is fun
Come on baby, you drive me crazy
Goodness gracious great balls of fire
