Did I slip? I know I stumbled
Did I trip? 'cause I know I fell
All's I know is I'll wake up
Here in my clothes tomorrow
But oh, girl I wish I knew 
You well
But oh, girl I wish I knew 
You well
But I'm just sayin' 
Hi,
To your answering bell

Did I run? I thought I was walkin'
Through your inexhaustible gale
The names are changed but the
Constellations
Are still fallin'
Oh girl, if you could only
Tell
Oh girl, if you could only 
Tell
But I'm just sayin' 
Hi

Let your tears fall and touch 
My skin
Then your thunderclouds could
Rage and wail
I will collect them all for 
You in butterfly jars
And oh girl, I'll build your
Wishing well
Oh girl, I'll build your 
Wishing well
But I'm just sayin' hi
To your answering bell

Did I sleep? 'cause I musta
Been dreamin'
Did I weep? 'cause I cried 
Like hell
All's I want is your fortress 
Of tears
To crumble

And oh girl, I'd tear 'em
Down myself
And oh girl, the story's they
Could tell
But I'm just sayin' hi
