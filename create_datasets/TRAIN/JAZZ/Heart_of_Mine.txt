I can't believe you really love me
That I can call the sun to shine
I'm so afraid there'll be
Another after me
Heart of mine
And yet when I receive your letter
I'm reassured by every line
I hope they still hold true
For me there's only you
Heart of mine
Are you on the level?
Do you tell me lies?
I'm between the devil
And your deep blue haunting eyes
I love you so I hate to lose you
To me you're something really fine
Don't ever change of heart
Say we'll never part
Heart of mine
