I could always lose you
Get out of your head
I don't know what you're used to
But you ain't seen nothing yet
The way the world is spinning
I don't want no regrets
So I could always lose you
That's what I said
That's what I said

I could always lose you
So don't get comfortable
My friends say that you're bad news
That you're bouncing off the walls
You could buy me flowers
But you worry instead
But I could always lose you
That's what I said

I know I could lose you (yeah, ah)
Do you hear what I said? (bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye)
I say that I could lose you
Just watch me walk away (bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye)

I could lose you in the morning
I could lose you in the evening
Even when I'm sleeping
It seems I can't get no release
You think you're winning
But there's no competition
Either way the decisions
Always come back to me, yeah

Don't think I've been missing
The kisses on my neck
The way your arms surround me
When we're laying in my bed
There ain't no denying
If I was still the best
But I could always lose you
That's what I said

I know I could lose you (yeah, ah)
Do you hear what I said? (bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye)
I say that I could lose you
Just watch me walk away (bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye)
                                                                                                                                          
I could lose you in the morning
I could lose you in the evening
Even when I'm sleeping
It seems I can't get no release
You think you're winning
But there's no competition
Either way the decisions
Always come back to me, yeah

Ay-ay, ay-yeah
Don't you run back to me, yeah
Ay-ay, yeah-yeah, ay-yeah

I know I could lose you (yeah, ah)
Do you hear what I said? (bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye)
I say that I could lose you
Just watch me walk away (bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye)

I could lose you in the morning
I could lose you in the evening
Even when I'm sleeping
It seems I can't get no release
You think you're winning
But there's no competition
Either way the decisions
Always come back to me, yeah

Ay-ay, ay-yeah
Don't you run back to me, yeah
Ay-ay, yeah-yeah, ay-yeah
I could always lose you
