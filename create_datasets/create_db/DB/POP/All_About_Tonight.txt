I bought a new pair of shoes
I got a new attitude, when I walk
'Cause I'm so over you
And it's all about tonight

I'm going out with the girls
Ready to show all the boys what I got
I'm letting go of the hurt
'Cause it's all about tonight

Yeah the night is alive
You can feel the heartbeat
Let's just go with the flow
We've been working all week
Tomorrow doesn't matter
When you're moving your feet
It's all about tonight

We'll be dancing and singing
And climbing up on the tables
We'll be rocking this party
So tell the DJ don't stop
Grab someone if you're single
Grab someone if you're not
It's all about tonight

And boy I'm not hanging on
'Cause I threw all your drama away
Had something good but it's gone
Yeah it's all about tonight
They got the music so loud
So I won't hear the phone if you call
And we're so over now
'Cause it's all about tonight

Yeah the night is alive
You can feel the heartbeat
Let's just go with the flow
We've been working all week
Tomorrow doesn't matter
When you're moving your feet
It's all about tonight

We'll be dancing and singing
And climbing up on the tables
We'll be rocking this party
So tell the DJ don't stop
Grab someone if you're single
Grab someone if you're not
It's all about tonight

Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight

Yeah the night is alive
You can feel the heartbeat
Let's just go with the flow
We've been working all week
Tomorrow doesn't matter
When you're moving your feet
It's all about tonight

We'll be dancing and singing
And climbing up on the tables
We'll be rocking this party
So tell the DJ don't stop
Grab someone if you're single
Grab someone if you're not
It's all about tonight
