All in red
You’re all in red
You’re all
All in red
All in red
You’re all in red
You’re all

When all emotion gets me down
I can be sure you'll be around
You bring out what's best in me
The poison from my mind
Creating what's make believe
It's all in your stride

And I tell myself to
Watch your step boy
You haven't got what it takes
Life seems so profound
And if a man can't do it
Then it's up to you to be around

All in red
You’re all in red
You’re all
All in red
All in red
You’re all in red
You’re all

Creating life that satisfies
Is surely all down to compromise
Ambition is dying now
Must be something more
A feeling of relaxation reapers at my door
Or is it in my mind

Watch your step boy
You haven't got what it takes
Life seems so profound
And if a man can't do it
Then it's up to you to be around

All in red
You’re all in red
You’re all… All in red
All in red
You’re all in red
You’re all… All in red
All in red
You’re all in red
You’re all… All in red
All in red
You’re all in red
You’re all

All in red
All in red
Cut that crap man

I really need you and
All in red
You’re all in red
You’re all
All in red
All in red
You’re all in red
You’re all
All in red
You’re all in red
You’re all
All in red
All in red
You’re all in red
You’re all
