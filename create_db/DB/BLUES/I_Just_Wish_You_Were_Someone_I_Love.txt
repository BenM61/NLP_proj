I did not mean to mislead you
I never intended that push come to shove
And I don't have one thing against you
I just wish you were someone I love

I thought I had fallen forever in love
The minute your red gingham dress hit the floor
But after I?d taken of all of your favors
The hungry inside of me cried out there's more

And don't misunderstand me, it?s not that you're lacking
The fact is your beauty?s what dreams are made of
I do not have one thing against you, sweet lady
I just wish you were someone I love

And I did not mean to mislead you
And I never intended that push come to shove
I don't have one thing against you
I just wish you were someone I love

I did not mean to mislead you
And I never intended that push come to shove
I don't have one thing against you
I just wish you were someone I love

I did not mean to mislead you
And I never intended that push come to shove
