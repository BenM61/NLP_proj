There is a swan-white curtain
Somewhere within the sky
It's known of every sermon
Every anguished cry
The howls of hopeless people
Frightened and alone

There is a spotless silver mirror
That hangs within the moon
It's witnessed every winter
The cities charred and ruined
The herds of homeless people
Filling all the roads

Some may pray to their mirrors
Some may kneel before the sun
Me, I say there's a mirror
In the heart of everyone

Bullets paint the blue distance
The mirror's stained from every gun
Still, I say that it glistens
In the heart of everyone

And there are golden whispers
Within the afternoon
They've held the brothers, sisters
Felt the mothers' wounds
The broken-hearted people
Burying their own

Some may pray to their mirrors
Some may kneel before the sun
Me, I say there's a mirror
In the heart of everyone

Strike the bell, and we listen
Light the candle, and we're shown
The gods themselves throwing incense
As all the world begins to glow

Such a flame, such a mirror
In the heart of everyone

Such a flame, such a mirror
In the heart of everyone
