I've got you on my mind
I'm feeling kind of sad and low
Got you on my mind
Feeling kind of sad and low

I'm wondering where you are
Wondering why you had to go

Tears begin to fall
Every time I hear your name
Tears begin to fall
Every time I hear your name

But since you went away
Nothing seems to be the same

No matter how I try
My heart keeps telling me that I
Can't forget you
If ever it should be
That you want to come back to me
I'm gonna let you

I've got you on my mind
I'm feeling kind of sad and low
Got you on my mind
Feeling kind of sad and low

I'm wondering where you are
Wondering why you had to go

No matter how I try
My heart keeps telling me that I
Can't forget you
If ever it should be
That you want to come back to me
I'm gonna let you

I've got you on my mind
I'm feeling kind of sad and low
Got you on my mind
Feeling kind of sad and low

I'm wondering where you are
Wondering why you had to go

I'm wondering where you are
Wondering why you had to go
