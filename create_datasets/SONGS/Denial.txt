Somewhere in the back of my mind
Secretly I know you will find
Me amongst the blushing and glow
Deep beyond the things I don't show

Mystery's a beautiful thing
What a gift a woman can bring
Never let it out just like that
Let him slowly figure it out

How can a flower bloom
Just over a day?
And at night
You gotta let the water drain in

I didn't wanna fall in love with you
I didn't wanna know the things I knew
It wasn't till I looked into the mirror
Denial

You were like a power of nature
Telepathic beautiful creature
Understanding all of my weakness
Patient, loving, knowing you'd reach it

Cynical and hurt was just me
You were never supposed to be
Part of what I would call amazing
Took so long to finally see

How can a flower bloom
Just over a day?
And at night
You gotta let the water drain in

I didn't wanna fall in love with you
I didn't wanna know the things I knew
It wasn't till I looked into the mirror
Denial

I didn't wanna fall in love with you
I didn't wanna know the things I knew
It wasn't till I looked into the mirror
Denial

I see the way the wind blows
Like open minds for us
No complicated barriers
To hold us back

I didn't wanna fall in love with you
I didn't wanna know the things I knew
It wasn't till I looked into the mirror
Denial

I didn't wanna fall in love with you
I didn't wanna know the things I knew
It wasn't till I looked into the mirror
Denial

I didn't wanna fall in love with you
I didn't wanna know the things I knew
It wasn't till I looked into the mirror
Denial
