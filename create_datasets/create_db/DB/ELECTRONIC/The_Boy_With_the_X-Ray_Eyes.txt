An invitation to dance on the floor 
Entertainment was low in my home 
My vicious eyes; what is love? 
Is it something inside my brain 
Love, oh it's driving us all insane 
The Boy with the X-Ray Eyes 
It's not a surprise 
Nothing really matters to him 

Spies, looking into my window 
I watch 
Spies, they're watching us tonight 

The Boy with the X-Ray Eyes 
It's not a surprise 

I see through your lies 
With my bionic eyes 
I see through your mind 
With my bionic, bionic 
I see through your lies with my bionic eyes 
Bionic, bionic, bionic eyes
