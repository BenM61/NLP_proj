This mornin' when I woke up, sushine touched my heart 
Children of the earth, they walk so far apart 
From this protection of what's supposed to be 
They don't have it goin' right
You've been people 

Who loves your neighbor  
They seem to miss the boat 
Letting others drown so they can stay afloat 
But we have love so real, just let them be 
I wanna thank someone for sendin' you to me 

Bless your mother, bless your father 
But most of all, bless you, bless me 
Let our love last for eternity 
People will try to break it 
They don't wanna see us make it 
We'll never let them take it, no sir-ee 

I can well remember, you left yourself home 
And the spells we left each other just last strong 
You think we'll have a love to share like we do 
They'd know the happiness I've got in here in you 

Bless you, bless me 
Let our love last for eternity 
People will try to break it 
They don't wanna see us make it 
We'll never let them take it, no sir-ee 

Oh I've got you and baby, you got me 
I wanna thank someone for lettin' us be 

Bless your mother (bless your mother) 
Bless your father (bless your father) 
But most of all, bless you, bless me 
Let our love last for eternity 
We're gonna make it, boy 
Heaven won't break it, boy 
I wanna share my joy that's heavenly
