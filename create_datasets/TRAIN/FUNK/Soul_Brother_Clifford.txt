Brother Clifford

Play that organ sound.
Play with fingers of fire
Play that organ sound.

Brother Clifford plays the organ
In the local Baptist church
And to all the congregation
He can make the organ talk.
Saturday the church is jam-packed

People come from miles around
Suddenly the air's electric
When Brother Clifford takes the stand.
Sister Virgin you're an cold cow
Watch-a gonna do ?
Johnny
You're a little scoundrel

I'm gonna tan your hide for you.
Sister Virgin
Reached her hand out

To give Johnny one around the ear
Caught an old man who was napping
And she got one back
No fear...
