Barren lands and barren minds (ice cold ice)
In another place and time (ice cold ice)
I feel I've never known myself (ice cold ice)
Frozen in the sand again (ice cold ice)

We'll see the blank expressions waiting for progression
Standing still in place and time
No one's moving
They're only standing still in ice cold ice cold ice

Only standing still in ice cold ice cold ice

We're all machines and all are one (ice cold ice)
We're catching up on what's been done (ice cold ice)
Stealing glimpses from the past (ice cold ice)
Well, these impressions always last (ice cold ice)

We're never penetrating, always contemplating
We sit and count the blessings but we're blessed by icons
No one else could trust in ice cold ice cold ice cold ice

Only standing still in ice cold ice cold ice

We'll stay together till the end (ice cold ice)
Thinking you might be a friend (ice cold ice)

We sit and pray together that they might change the weather
My love for you will never die
If I sound distant, that's because
You shouldn't see me crying ice cold ice

Shouldn't see me crying ice cold ice
Shouldn't see me crying ice cold ice
Shouldn't see me crying ice cold ice
Shouldn't see me crying ice cold ice
Shouldn't see me crying ice cold ice
Shouldn't see me crying ice cold ice
You shouldn't see me, you shouldn't see
