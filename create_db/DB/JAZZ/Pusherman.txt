I make moves and I'm gonna be a
I'll be a pusherman
I make moves and I'm gonna be a
I'll be a pusherman

I make moves and I'm gonna be a
I'll be a pusherman
I make moves and I'm gonna be a pusherman

Now listen what I have to say
'Coz I might just make your night
You see me in the corner, shady
But I don't qualify

Come up to me people
And ask me for somethings
I might give you what you looking for
Some dirty, wicked frills

Don't ask questions
I am selling lives
Never need no police
To come and get me off surprise

I'm always on the slower
I'll never get caught
My pocket's get fatter everyday
'Coz I'm always selling it short

I make moves and I'm gonna be a
I'll be a pusherman
I make moves and I'm gonna be a
I'll be a pusherman

I make moves and I'm gonna be a
I'll be a pusherman
I make moves and I'm gonna be a pusherman

They game is a nasty one
It never let's you get away
If you really fought to long
You know you gonna have to pay

This is what my business is
I am selling everyday
If I step up, get caught out
In prison I will stay

What about my people
That lie and cheat and steal
Don't know who my true friends are
Is this my life for real?

They don't even business
All the dudes get high
The wish gets bigger everyday
But you know I still get by

I make moves and I'm gonna be a
I'll be a pusherman
I make moves and I'm gonna be a
I'll be a pusherman

I make moves and I'm gonna be a
I'll be a pusherman
I make moves and I'm gonna be a pusherman

We all gotta do a little hustle now and then
But everybody knows how the story ends
We all gotta do a little hustle now and then
But everybody knows how the story ends

I make moves and I'm gonna be a
I'll be a pusherman
I make moves and I'm gonna be a
I'll be a pusherman

I make moves and I'm gonna be a
I'll be a pusherman
I make moves and I'm gonna be a pusherman
