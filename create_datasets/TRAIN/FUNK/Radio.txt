I met this girl on radio
Said ? low
She wasn't getting my sound
She kept the ? down
I told her turn up the bass
And the she gives me in my face
I told her I had a girl
That meant the world to me
She just looked me up and down
Wrote her name on me
Thought of putting on a dress
Thought of leaking on my chest

I tried to move away
She found me the very next day
She found me the very next day

See that girl is so fast
She ? smoking in making cash
She ? smoking in making cash

She knows I like it like that
She knows where exactly is that
She knows I like it like that
That girl is going on my hat
She knows I like it like that
She knows where exactly is that
You got me
Something I don't wanna do
I still wouldn't make it
Dance on a tango with you
I didn't want to go there
Call me in a month or two
I know you really wanna a baby
I think I want one too
But the chance is not sure
It don't want to wait you
See every time we touch
I take chances of a fool
Stone rollin' baby 
Stone rollin' baby 
I take chances of a fool
Stone rollin' baby
Stone rollin' baby
