How does it feel
When your walls fall down?
How does it feel
When you're lost and found?
How does it feel
It's the sweetest sound
How does it feel

I can feel my fire burning
Got my mind in overdrive
Lose focus, vision blurring
And time is on the line

There's no mistake 'cause I know what I'm craving
And I don't wanna wait no more
And I control this path that I'm taking
But I don't wanna wait no more

How does it feel
When your walls fall down?
How does it feel
When you're lost and found?
How does it feel
It's the sweetest sound
How does it feel

How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel

I'll face my fears, no running
Got my feet firm on the ground
Set sail, the ocean's calling
To find a land unfound

There's no mistake 'cause I know what I'm craving
And I don't wanna wait no more
And I control this path that I'm taking
But I don't wanna wait no more

How does it feel
When your walls fall down?
How does it feel
When you're lost and found?
How does it feel
It's the sweetest sound
How does it feel

How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel

Oh-oh, I'm not giving up
Oh-oh, how does it feel
Oh-oh, I'm not giving up
Oh-oh, how does it feel
How does it feel
