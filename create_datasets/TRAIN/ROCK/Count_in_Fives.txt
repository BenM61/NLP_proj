Count
Yeah I count in fives.
I do it every time.
And If another number confronts me
I will cut you in half.

Irrespective of the subject
I will make it apply,
No matter what the object
I will count in fives,
Just tell me the location
I will stand outside...

Oh yeah,
If you give me too many
I will multiply.
Force too many into my hand and
I will not comprehend.

Oh yeah,
Another number confronts me
And I force it to divide.
The first time with someone holding my hand. The second, me holding it out.

Tally tally.

Oh yeah,

If you try to deceive me
I fell it burn in my hand.
Now watch the numbers run to me as
I count them in fives.
