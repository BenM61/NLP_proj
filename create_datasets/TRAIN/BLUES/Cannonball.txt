I hear the rain on the rooftop
Crown and coke on a table by my bed
I'm laying here like it's my grave
A bag of bones with a fire in my head
Oh, yes, I am

I tell you, no, then I start to give in
You tear me down, then we do it all over again
And again

I'm down on my knees and I'm screamin'
I'm a fiend, and I'm beggin' you, please
If you don't love me, baby, just stop
Tell me, how can it be I'm still bleedin'
I can't quit, I need help, set me free
Shook me up 'cause you know that I'll cry
Fly, then I fall every time that you call
I'm nothin' but your cannonball (cannonball)

When you was hungry
Girl, you came knockin' at my door, yeah
I fed you misery 'til you kept comin' on back
And comin' on back for more, mmm
My heart was homeless
My lust, for vampires and whores
Still you kept comin' on back for more
C'mon, girl

I'm down on my knees and I'm screamin'
I'm a fiend, and I'm beggin' you, please
If you don't love me, baby, just stop (no, no, no)
Tell me, how can it be I'm still bleedin'
I can't quit, I need help, set me free (I want to get outta here, I wanna go home)
Shook me up (oh whoa whoa)

Fly, then I fall every time that you call
I'm nothin' but your cannonball (your cannonball)
(Cannonball)

I tell you, "no", then I start to give in (let's do)
You tear me down, then we do it all over again (Let's do it all over again, mmm)
