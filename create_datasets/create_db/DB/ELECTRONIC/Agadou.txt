Agadou Dou Dou Dou -
Push the Pineapple
shake the tree.
Agadou Dou Dou Dou -
Push the Pineapple
grind coffee.
To the left - to the right
Jump up and down and to the knees

Come and dance every night
Sing with the hula melody.

I met a hot blooded Miss
Last summer in Waikiki

Where she was selling the Pine
And playing Yukulele.
And when I waved to the girl
Come on and teach me that sway

She laughed and whispered to me:
Oh yes
come tonight to the bay

The beach and the sky - the moon of Hawaii.
Around her hips a Sarong

We're always singing this song.
Agadou Dou Dou Dou - . . .
Agadou Dou Dou Dou - . . .
And down on the shore began the romance -
She showed me much more
Not only the dance.
Agadou Dou Dou Dou - . . .
Agadou Dou Dou Dou - . . .
The beach and the sky

The moon of Hawaii -
Around her hips a Sarong

We're always singing this song.
Agadou Dou Dou Dou - . . .
