Now... who got the beat that makes ya bump? 
And who got the bump that ya thump? 
Well, I got the funk that makes ya bump 
So we gon funk this motherfucker right on up 
Well here's a toast to the boogie while I step on in 
So put your lighters in the air and let the smoke kick in 
I got the motion, the potion 
And once hit the groove everything is in motion 
We coastin through the neighborhood and lookin around 
And all of my homies on lock down, we keep it underground 
Man, I done found the only way to put mine down is to dip, skip with the homies from the Dogg Pound 
Sup, Bow-Wow, how my nigga feelin? 
Oh, I'm on the money mission to get a pocket full of millions 
Like Sicilians, we do it mafioso 
Doggy style, Dogg Pound, Death Row is the logo 
I do it by my lonely cause I'm true to the code 
Plus I die with the homies cause that's all I really know 
Who started with me, who departed with me 
Through thick and thin we heartless-ass G's 
Regardless, let's see with biphocles, let's try the locals 
And why'all wonder why they despise my vocals 
I fooled you like crystals, rap spittin like lips do 
When I dismiss you, me and my click, fool 

[Chorus:] 
May I (may... I), may I funk with you? 
(repeat x4) 
To be a high rolla, you need a pistola 
And about a half a key of some Coca Cola 
Now that I got older, I got a little colder 
And I don't trip to get a chip off my nigga's shoulder 
Million dreams of a gangsta, being like Cagney 
A bowlie for Snoop Doggy 
Ain't no follow-up, man, I'm a general, so when I put it down I gots to be so orignal 
I'm quick to bust, just like Daz Dillinger 
But that's the little homie, I'm the big homie, Snoop Don Corleone 
Spit three words up in lightning 
As long as I'm bouncin with this I know you like it 
Fo' sho tho, you can't take my fo-do' 
I'm layin around in the DPG in a grey photo 
Get pushed around downtown in the back of a car 
The Double are from the Durwood store 

[Chorus:] 
Well in verse three, the worst see? 
After part two, know when I stop the clock there be a heart, too 
And just the two of us, gonna show you how we do, 
I thought you knew we bust 
I demolish, stay polished, no time to rust 
No dividing, multiplying cause it's never too much, like Luthor 
Cause ya see ain't no loser 
that can get the scoop on the supa-dupa Snoop 
I refuse the tactics, you ain't used to drastics 
I choose to mash like Land Cruisers 
You know I isn't the bomb digga-dee, bomb-beeze 
They can't get with the D-O double G 
You no MC slash master of ceramonies 
Runnin thangs, pullin strings callin Snoop pesky 
Lesson, blessin', stressin' manifest me 
Don't want to test me, I'm guaranteed to let it rest, see? 

Chorus x3 

May I?
