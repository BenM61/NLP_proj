Sometimes I feel like I'm in Barcelona
See anytime I hear this tune I just start drifting away
And all I wanna do is go back
Sometimes I feel like I'm in Barcelona
See anytime I hear this tune I just start drifting away

Sometimes I, I feel like I don't know what's going on
And sometimes I'm led to believe everything I know is wrong
I keep on telling myself that it's real
And always keeping the truth it's all in my mind
Explanations for the way that I feel
Are so hard to find
That's why that's why

Sometimes I feel like I'm in Barcelona
See anytime I hear this tune I just start drifting away
And all I wanna do is go back, go back
Sometimes I feel like I'm in Barcelona
See anytime I hear this tune I just start drifting away
And all I wanna do is go back back
(And all I wanna do is go)
(And all I wanna do is go back)

I feel (Like)
I feel
I feel (Like)
Like I wanna go back, like I gotta go back
I feel (Like)
Said I feel
Like I wanna go back, like I gotta go back

Each time I decide these feelings can't keep going on, no no
It's just a matter of time before they come back twice as strong

Sometimes I feel like I'm in Barcelona
See anytime I hear this tune I just start drifting away
And all I wanna do is go back back back

Sometimes I feel like I'm in Barcelona
See anytime I hear this tune I just start drifting away
And all I wanna do is go back, go back
Sometimes I feel like I'm in Barcelona
See anytime I hear this tune I just start drifting away
And all I wanna do is go back, back

Sometimes I feel like I'm in Barcelona
Sometimes I feel like I'm in Barcelona
See anytime I hear this tune I just start drifting away
