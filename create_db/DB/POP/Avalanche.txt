I have spent too many nights
Wondering what wrong did I do
Was it something I said
Or did my silence haunt you
Never meant for you to question
Didn't intend to enrage
You say I've got a way with words
You say I always run to them 

Tonight I feel abandoned
By the muse of my heart
Tear by tear 
I feel us tearing apart 
Like an avalanche
This love is falling
Crushing you and I
Will there be survivors
When the storm is over
Someone left to cry. 

Do you ever remember
What it was once like
How you would move every mountain
Just to be by my side
Now I feel that I must struggle
Just to get into your mind

Can't you hear me I'm hanging
Won't you let me in tonight 

Like an avalanche
This love is falling
Crushing you and I
Will there be survivors
When the storm is over
Someone left to cry 

Tonight I feel abandoned
By the muse of my heart
Tear by tear I feel us tearing apart 
Like an avalanche
This love is falling
Crushing you and I
Will there be survivors
When the storm is over
Someone left to cry
