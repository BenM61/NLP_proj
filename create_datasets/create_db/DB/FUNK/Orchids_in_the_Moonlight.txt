When orchids bloom in the moonlight
And lovers vow to be true
I still can dream in the moonlight
Of one dear night that we knew

When orchids fade in the dawning
They speak of tears and good-bye
Though my dreams are shattered
Like the petals scattered
Still my love can never die.

There is peace in the twilight
When the day is through
But the shadows that fall
Only seem to recall
All my longing for you

There is a dream in the moonbeams
Upon the sea of blue
But the moonbeams that fall
Only seem to recall
Love is all, love is you
