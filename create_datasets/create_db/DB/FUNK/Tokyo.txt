I am neon
Cold neon
Not a mystery

All I've every known is
How to be alone
It comes naturally

Oh baby, can I hold you?
Such a cold, cold night
I thought I wouldn't need to
I've got my neon lights
I'm longing just to feel you
To know that it's alright
Oh baby baby baby baby

I'm out of sight
I'm out of mind
Alone in Tokyo

You're out of reach
Wrong place, wrong time
Alone in Tokyo

Here I go again
To and fro again
Overnight delivery

Grew a thicker skin
Now it's growing thin
You can see right into me

Oh baby, can I hold you?
Such a cold, cold night
I thought I wouldn't need to
I've got my neon lights
If only just to feel you
To know that it's alright
Oh baby baby baby baby

I'm out of sight
I'm out of mind
Alone in Tokyo

You're out of reach
Wrong place, wrong time
Alone in Tokyo

I'm out of sight
Going out of my mind
Alone in Tokyo

You're out of reach
Wrong place, wrong time
Alone in Tokyo

Oh, in Tokyo
