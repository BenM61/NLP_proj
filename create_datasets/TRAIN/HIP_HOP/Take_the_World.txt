Yo, I got my bags packed
Crepe's laced up, let the black match
'09 was all mine, padlock it, had that
My own mind, front line, war like its Baghdad
I took aim, target the frame, I let him have that
Few of us are here now, many more to come soon
Let a little rain down, get ready for the monsoon
Ready for the onslaught all you see is Concordes
Black clouds will end this, ready for the full moon

I know, I know, that I'll be coming back around, yeah

And I'll be coming back around here, I'm on a cloud 9
Tell me how it looks here

Maybe we can take the World tonight
There's nothing that I wouldn't sacrifice,
Till we made it, till we made it,
I know we can make it through the fight
As long as you're riding by my side
Till we made it, till we made it, yeah

It's drama, yeah aint ready for the drama
Ring the alarm we are blazing the lava

I'm drama, yeah there not ready for the drama
What goes round, comes round that's Karma

Yeah we can make this, sure we can make it
Had enough of asking so now we're gonna take it
Open the doors wide, size 6 for the side
Rearrange the game, lift the cheek bones, face lift
Yeah, now we've mastered the basics
Only difference is you wasn't blessed with the same gift
Thanks I do give, I count my blessings
Magic with words, full life no tricks

I know, I know, that I'll be coming back around, yeah

And I'll be coming back around here, I'm on a cloud 9
Tell me how it looks here

There's nothing that I wouldn't sacrifice,
Till we made it, till we made it,
I know we can make it through the fight
As long as you're riding by my side
Till we made it, till we made it, yeah

Just like that, they say learn from your mistakes
But we plan to perfection, so we don't plan to misplace
(round and round and round and back again)
And I do it at my own pace
Yeah

Maybe we can take the World tonight
There's nothing that I wouldn't sacrifice, no
Till we made it, till we made it,
I know we can make it through the fight
As long as you're riding by my side
Till we made it, till we made it, yeah

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Black clouds
Ring the alarm, we are blazing the lava
And are they ready for the drama
