First of all let me say
You can't accuse me of all the things
You know that you are guilty of
And I see that it is easy for you to blame
Everything on me
If that's the case I should go have my fun
Do all the things you say I do
Boy I can't continue to take this from you

I might as well have cheated on you
As much as you accused me of cheating
I might as well have lied to you
As much as you accused me of lying
I might as well have gone to the club
As much as you accused me of clubbin'
I might as well have threw away my love
As much as you accused me
I should have cheated

Let me say I was out with somebody else
When my girl told me she saw you with some girl
(Some girl)
But I didn't accuse you of something that I didn't see myself
Realize that I would never do anything to disrespect you
Trust me, you gotta stop accusing me

I might as well have cheated on you
As much as you accused me of cheating
I might as well have lied to you
As much as you accused me of lying
I might as well have gone to the club
As much as you accused me of clubbin'
I might as well have threw away my love
As much as you accused me

Don't you know I wish I knew
That you would treat me this way
If you don't promise me
That you've changed your ways I'm leaving today
And I ain't coming back
And you made it like that
Was unfair to me
All this jealousy
I'm your everything
What will you do without me
Why you tripping?

I might as well have cheated on you
As much as you accused me of cheating
I might as well have lied to you
As much as you accused me of lying
I might as well have gone to the club
As much as you accused me of clubbin'
I might as well have threw away my love
As much as you accused me
I should have cheated

I should have lied
I should have cheated
Maybe I should have went out to the club
Or maybe I, should have done it
Should have given away all my love
Or maybe I, I should have played you
'Cause you don't appreciate me, no
And I tried to stay down with you
But you're making it hard for me

I might as well have cheated on you
As much as you accused me of cheating
I might as well have lied to you
As much as you accused me of lying
I might as well have gone to the club
As much as you accused me of clubbin'
I might as well have threw away my love
As much as you accused me
I should have cheated

As much as you accused me of cheating
I should have cheated
As much as you accused me of lying
As much as you accused me of clubbin'
As much as you accused me of cheating
I should have cheated

I should have cheated

I should have cheated
I should have cheated
I should have cheated
I should have cheated
