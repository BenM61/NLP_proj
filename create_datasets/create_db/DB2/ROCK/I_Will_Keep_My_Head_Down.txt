Come down, closer
I know this is everlasting
Somehow closer along the way 

So much, now this
And I feel worse than I have ever felt
And I know you say you'll find a way 

And I will pray for you
I will keep my head down 

And I will keep my head down and I'll follow
Keep my head down and I'll follow
Keep my head down
I will keep my head down
For you
Keep my head down 

My will is empty
I'm counting every minute every hour every day
And I see you slowly fade along the way 

Come down, closer
I know this is everlasting
I know you say you'll find a way 

I will stay
But you oh
I will keep my head down
For you 

And I will keep my head down and I'll follow
Keep my head down and I'll follow
Keep my head down
And I will keep my head down
For you
I will keep my head down
For you 

And though I'm spinning and I can't sleep
These thoughts around me
When all I've given you means nothing, nothing
And though I'm spinning and I can't speak
I cannot bring you back 

So stream on, through me
I know this is everlasting
Words mean so much along the way 

And I will keep my head down and I'll follow
Keep my head down and I'll follow
Keep my head down
I will keep my head down 
I will keep my head down 
I will keep my head down 
For you 
For you 
For you 
I, I said I will keep my head down 

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 

I will, I will, I will, I will yeah
Keep my head down for you
