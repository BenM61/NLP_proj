Her December is a mood swing
An afternoon frost meant just for me
Her December is a change of pace
An extraordinary leap from sunray to snowflake

Her December means I'll be alone in the morning

Her December is a look so cold
It leaves me defenseless
Shoots my story full of holes
Her December is a long night
With one eye open
Thinkin' of a better lie

Her December means I'll be alone in the morning

Her December is the last clue
That she will never give me another June

Her December means I'll be alone in the morning
