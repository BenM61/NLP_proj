Well the sun is burning down on the pavement
Money in the bank
I ain't gonna save it
Jenny's coming by
Hope she makes it
Jenny's coming by
Sure hope she makes it

It's a summertime thing
Summertime thing

There's a party next door, sounds like it's cooking
I poked my head over the wall
Took a look in
There was a five piece band
They was really rockin'
Looked like some kind of family reunion

Hey
It's a summertime thing
Summertime thing

That summer heat has got me feeling lazy
The air is warm and the sky is hazy
People getting down, getting crazy
People getting down, getting stupid, betting crazy

Hey
It's a summertime thing
Summertime thing

Go ask your dad for the keys to the Honda
Can your sister come along, how could she not wanna
Put the Beach Boys on, wanna hear Help Me Rhonda
Roll down the sides we'll drive to the delta
Take off our clothes and jump into the river
Ain't nobody around
Ain't nobody gonna see us
Take off your clothes jump into the river

Hey
It's a summertime thing
Summertime thing
