It's hard to perceive
My mind is at ease
It's hard to believe 
I don't feel a thing

Am I wrong to feel
Such bliss that ain't real
Can I keep this from
Taking over me

Fell into, this moment
And now the chemical is taking the
Inside right out of me
I found a mountain of pure endless energy
I keep telling myself it's not reality

Now I'm seeing, now I'm seeing
That the world around me is now changing
Once it was a break that I could keep
I tried to walk away but I can't

What, what's inside my brain
What's breaking me down
What's inside this raging chemical?

Now it's time for me
To rest with ease
Now it's time 
To allow my mind relief

But I can't stop
This feeling that I need
Can I keep this from taking over me?

Forget, all the regrets
As I indulge myself with every breath
Of this moment
Knowing I can't taste the beauty of life again
Without a chemical running through my head

Now I'm feeling, now I'm feeling
That the world around me's now changing
Once it was a break that I could keep
I tried to walk away but I can't

What, what's inside my brain
What's breaking me down
What's inside this raging chemical?

I feel it
I see it
I need it
So bring it to me

Never again, never again
Will I
Feel the same, feel the same
About me
Can I begin, can I begin
To start this whole life over

Never again, never again
Will I
Walk the same, walk the same
Around here
Can I forget, can I forget
That what lives within me

Never again, never again
Will I
Breathe the same, breathe the same
Air in
I want to live, I want to live
But they say

Never, never
What, what's inside my brain
What's breaking me down
What's inside this raging chemical?
