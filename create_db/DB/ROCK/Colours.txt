Yellow is the colour of my true love's hair
In the mornin' when we rise
In the mornin' when we rise
That's the time, that's the time
I love the best

Blue's the colour of the sky
In the mornin' when we rise
In the mornin' when we rise
That's the time, that's the time
I love the best

Green's the colour of the sparklin' corn
In the mornin' when we rise
In the mornin' when we rise
That's the time, that's the time
I love the best

Mellow is the feeling that I get
When I see her, mm hmm
When I see her, uh huh
That's the time, that's the time
I love the best

Freedom is a word I rarely use
Without thinkin', mm hmm
Without thinkin', mm hmm
Of the time, of the time
When I've been loved
