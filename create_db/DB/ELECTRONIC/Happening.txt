I'm running out of patience, but then you say
It's over baby, so go on, we both need you to say this to us
You are, the only one for me

Every night you stay with her
I pretend it doesn't hurt cause
The hardest part of this is wondering when all this is
It's like it's getting worse
She'll always have had you first
You know the hardest part of this
Is wanting the two of us to begin

Every single night I wait for you
Every single day you say it's through
You promised me the night at 2 am that it's happening
You're gonna tell her what she needs to hear
You gotta be the one to make it clear you promised me
That night at 2 am that it's happening
That it's happening. That it's happening
That it's happening

I'm so anxious that I'm shaken
We're so close to being together, boy I
Have almost giving up on this before
But it's worth it, if it is forever

Every night you stay with her
I pretend it doesn't hurt cause the hardest part
Of this is wondering when all this is
It's like it's getting worse
She'll always have had you first
You know the hardest part of this
Is wanting the two of us to begin

Every single night I wait for you
Every single day you say it's through
You promised me the night at 2 am that it's happening
You're gonna tell her what she needs to hear
You gotta be the one to make it clear
You promised me that night at 2 am that it's happening
That it's happening. That it's happening
That it's happening

Like winter turns to summer, like night turns into da
Been missing you like the dessert needs the rain
The hardest part of this is wanting, the two of us to begin

Every single night I wait for you
Every single day you say it's through
You promised me the night at 2 am that it's happening
You're gonna tell her what she needs to hear
You gotta be the one to make it clear
You promised me that night at 2 am that it's happening
That it's happening. That it's happening
That it's happening

You gonna make it happen baby
