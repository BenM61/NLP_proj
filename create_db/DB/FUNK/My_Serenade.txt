My serenade begins in the night
Plays the strings of my heart

My serenade becomes a delight
Your kisses help play the part

Sweet and strong love plays it soft
And our hearts begin to glow

As it plays our serenade
It's music with thrill to love

This is my serenade
My serenade, my serenade

This is my serenade
My serenade
