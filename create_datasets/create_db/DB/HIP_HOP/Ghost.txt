Riverside on Friday night
My friends remain
They say your name
But my guard has gone
Put a brave face on
And make a smile you could hear
But you're not here
I'll trace the whole world to find your ghost
But wherever I go I'm alone
There's no-one else
Still living by myself
Yes I'm eating well
I still cook for two you know
And the bathroom's clean
Windows let the sun shine in
My complexion's clear
But you're not here
An empty bedroom
A silent phone
Wherever I go I'm alone
Wherever I go I'm alone
A stranger's face, a different place
I see you everywhere
It's funny how time does nothing
and doesn't seem to care
But
I'll trace the whole world to find your ghost
Who could understand me now you're gone
I'll leave the bedroom
Unhook the phone
But wherever I go I'm alone
I'll trace the whole world to find your ghost
But wherever I go I'm alone
