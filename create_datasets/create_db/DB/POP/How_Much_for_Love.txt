I was lost in King's Cross
When I saw you
What a neat car
I had no idea where I was

A complete loss.
She said
"It doesn't matter son I'll take care of you."
I was shocked at King's Cross

When you asked me how much I was
I said "Please point me towards Eros or a bus stop"
She said.
"It doesn't matter son I will guide you through,
If you don't know what to do"

How much for love?
Have I enough for you to show me how?
No I don't want to hear the story of your life
For I've been bruised enough tonight
But do you want to see the video of mine?.
