I'm alive
I feel it now
I never knew I'll find it on you
Out of line we got ourselves
In a look, wait we are not fine
Wait, you are not mine
We find

Eyes stuck looking at
Our eyes are making out
We're not made for this
Fighting love
Eyes stuck looking at
Our eyes are making out
We're too close to be out of touch
Out of touch, ooh oh
Out of touch

Lay away, quite corner
Side by side, we follow our minds
Walk it on, then we trip
On the line, wait we are not fine
Wait, you are not mine
We find

Our eyes stuck looking at
Our eyes are making out
We're not made for this
Fighting love
Eyes stuck looking at
Our eyes are making out
We're too close to be out of touch
Eyes stuck looking at
Our eyes are making out
We're not made for this
Fighting love
Eyes stuck looking at
Our eyes are making out
We're too close to be out of touch

I can't stay low
I'm always glad when we make up
I'm just as there as you
So, when we wake up
I can't stay low
I'm always glad when we make up
I'm just as there as you
So, when we make up

Eyes stuck looking at
Our eyes are making out
We're not made for this
Fighting love
Eyes stuck looking at
Our eyes are making out
We're too close to be out of touch
Eyes stuck looking at
Our eyes are making out
We're not made for this
Fighting love
Eyes stuck looking at
Our eyes are making out
We're too close to be out of touch
Oh oh, out of touch
Out of touch
Out of touch
Out of touch
