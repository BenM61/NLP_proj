There is one girl in my life
That makes me love again
As pretty as a girl could be
So beautiful.
Every morning she makes me a cup of coffee
With a smile on her face
I'm a man in love
And she's glorious

There is one girl in my life
That makes me love again
As pretty as a girl could be so beautiful.
Every morning I wake up and I think of you
With a smile on my face
I'm a man in love
And she's glorious

Oh baby I want you to stay in my life
Never say goodbye even if you cry
I'm still by your side
