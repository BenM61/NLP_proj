I'm your's
Don't you know that I done fell for you
I want to know, baby
Tell me what cha gonna do
You took my love
All my love

Don't lead me astray
Let me go the right way

My heart, baby
Is all weak for you
So please
Be careful and treat me true
'Cause you're my life
I want to be a wife

Don't lead me astray
Let me go the right way

Let me go the right way
Where you lead me
Where you lead me
I'll follow you
What you tell me
What you tell me
That's what I'll do

'Cause baby I'm your's
Don't you know that I done fell for you
I want to know, baby
What cha gonna do
You took my love
All my love

Don't lead me astray
Let me go the right way
Don't you lead me astray
