Oh oh oh break it down
 
Girl, don't leave me
Don't take this as an aggression
Girl, I've learned my lesson
Don't leave me
Ooh the natural way
You receive me
Don't take this as an aggression
 
I just want to be alone with you
And there's nothing else I'd rather do
I just want the chance I had again
Just us two till the end
 
Now just the other night on the phone
I tried to impress you with my tone
I've got to be for real if you're my friend
Or you'll never call me back again
 
Girl, don't leave me 
Don't leave me, don't leave me
Oooh the natural way you receive me
Oh no
Don't take this as an aggression
Girl, I've learned my lesson
Oh, yes I have
Ooh the natural way
You receive me, the natural way
Don't take this as an aggression 
Aaaaaaaaah
 
Girl, don't leave me 
Don't leave me, don't leave me
Oooh the natural way you receive me
Oh no
Don't take this as an aggression
Girl, I've learned my lesson
Oh, yes I have
Ooh the natural way
You receive me, the natural way
Don't take this as an aggression 
Aaaaaaaaah
 
Girl don't be afraid ahh baby
 
Girl, don't leave me 
Don't leave me, don't leave me
Oooh the natural way you receive me
Oh no
Don't take this as an aggression
Girl, I've learned my lesson
Oh, yes I have
Ooh the natural way
You receive me, the natural way
Don't take this as an aggression
