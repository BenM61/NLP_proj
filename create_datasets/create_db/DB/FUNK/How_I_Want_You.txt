I can picture us a flame in this fire
Getting intimate right here in the dark
Holding love and then relax
I'll give you the world, yes I would

If it's not enough each day of the week
I'll give you more than just the pleasure you seek
I'll be so good to you baby
I'll make you wanting more and more
Like you never had it before

There's ain't another space to go
Sensual, emotional
Imagine that and then you'll know
How I want you

Baby if you let it go
Learn to let your feelin's show
This is when you come to know
How I want you

Really enjoy yourself the mood never ends
While the saxophone and the violin
Will begin to explain how intense we love
Oh baby, I know I'm not supposed to let you kiss me
Have this special as a women can be

Sit down a little closer to me baby
I'll make you want it more and more
Like you never had it before

There's ain't another space to go
Sensual, emotional
Imagine that and then you'll know
How I want you

Baby if you let it go
Learn to let your feelin's show
This is when you come to know
How I want you

I'll be so good to you baby
I'll make you wanting, yeah
Like you never had it before

There's ain't another space to go
Sensual, emotional
Imagine that and then you'll know
How I want you

Baby if you let it go
Learn to let your feelin's show
This is when you come to know
How I want you

Let's make merry just for you
I'll hold you down and I pour champagne
How I want you

Feelin' your love song so soft and low
Just to get you in the mood
This is what I'll do to show you
How I want you

There's ain't another space to go
Sensual, emotional
Imagine that I am in your love
How I want you

Baby if you let it go
Learn to let your feelin's show
This is when you come to know
How I want you
