I know a shoe salesman 
He's an acquaintance of mine 
One day he showed me some 
Marks on his arms in a line 
I did not know what to say 
"Do you think those freckles will stay?" 

I need a popsicle 
Do you want lemon or lime 
I've got a special today 
If you've got the time 
Winking, she poked me in the side 
"Well, we could go for a ride" 

I did not know what to say 
"Do you think those freckles will stay?" 
Ha 

Well, you think she will see, yeah
I don't think she will see 

Hey, Yeah...
