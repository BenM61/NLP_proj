Thou have fathered 
Son and daughter 
Doth begat, yet raised not bother 
Paralyzed your children's lives 
Wither vines of family ties 

Self-destruction 
Make him function 
Crayons and clay 
Days turn blue to gray 
Days turn blue to gray 

Seventeen when 
Family begin 
Drinking, fighting, heroin 
Unquenchable addictions call 
Responsible to none above all 

Self-destruction 
Make him function 
Crayons and clay 
Days turn blue to gray 
Days turn blue to gray 

Lest I taste 
Its sweet grapes 
Glass to tongue 
Across it tips 
Cross my lips 
Swallow it down 

Please 
Won't you love me? 
Please help me see 
What did I do? 
Did I hurt you? 
And now that you're gone 
Emptiness lives on 
The guilt is all I feel 
No closure 

Father 
Motherfucker 
No closure 

The strings of my heart 
You pulled on endlessly 
This twine is severed 
In tragedy 

Father 
Mother Destroyer 
Destroy her 

Your self-destruction 
What made you feel alive 
Your self-destruction 
Of your children's 
Lives
