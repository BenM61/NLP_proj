I pace the length of my unmade room
In times of change
My bags are packed, 
Guess I'm leaving the womb
Into the rain

We never found
A place to hide
Some peace of mind
God knows we tried

Toes in the sand, 
The seductive sway
Ooh, nothing better, babe
Across the bay
Sarasota Way
We held together

We never found 
A place to hide
Some peace of mind 
God knows we tried, yeah

So we walk down to Memorial Beach 
Where things began
Honey days and nights without sleep
Lost in the sand

We never found a place to hide
Some peace of mind
God knows we tried, yeah
