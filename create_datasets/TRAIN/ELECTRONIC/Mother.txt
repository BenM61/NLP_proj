Mother you are always around
Let me tell you you're the only one
Mother, when I see that look in your eyes
I know that you're my only child
And you make my world around
And round and round
And round and round
And round and round 

Amio sumoni
Yofanati vorento
Amere coreni
Yoa simento canante

Rentiro men foni
Senti re da muntera
Ioshepa runo
Solite tiro re tira-o-o

Do you love your mother
Like I love mine?
Do you want to hold her
All through the night?
The silence is my soul
Love just agree
Rest
