When I'm with you
I can never read your mind
Why don't you know
I'm lying when I say I'm fine

Why don't you learn
How to love me
When I can't sleep
Would you hold me
I'd only cry
If I can't speak
Should've to show you 
How to love me
How to love me

No oh

I guess you're too cool
To hold my hand on Valentine's
But what do I know
I'm just a girl you stand beside

When will you learn
How to love me
When I can't sleep
Would you hold me
I'd only cry
If I could speak
Should've to show you 
How to love me

Baby when we look in a mirror
Does it make the beautiful clearer
Chip in my name can't even tell her blue
Why would you learn how to love me
Learn how to love me

Oh when will you learn 
how to love me
When I can't sleep
Would you hold me
I'd only cry
If I could speak
Should've to show you 
How to love me

How to love me
No oh
How to love me
How to love me
How to love me
