I know that we have to take it to the goal
'cause everyone's depending on we
See we ain't got nowhere to go but up,
It's our destiny

We're choosing the way,
We'll do what it takes to get
To the top of the highest mountain
We'll do anything, we got to prove ourselves
'cause we know

Oh Africa

See we'll never be able to forget this day
'cause it's the greatest day of our life
See no matter what happens at least we can say
"we came, we saw, we tried"

We're choosing nowhere,
We'll do what it takes to get
To the top of the highest mountain
We'll do anything, we got to prove ourselves
'cause we know

Oh Africa

This is our time to shine,
Our time to fly,
Our time to be inside the sky
Our time to soar,
Our time to saw,
The last one in football

Oh Africa
