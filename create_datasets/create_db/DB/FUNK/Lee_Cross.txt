Well if you lose me, oh yes
You'll lose a good thing
Well if you lose me, oh yes
You'll lose a good thing

You know I love you girl
But I want you to do right
If you would only straighten up
We'd have a good life
And if you don't believe me, oh yes
You'll lose a good thing

Well if you lose me, oh yes
You'll lose a good thing
You do all your parading
With every guy in town
I try to find you, woman
And you're nowhere to be found

But if you lose me, oh yes
You'll lose a good thing
Well if you lose me, oh yes
You'll lose a good thing

You know I love you woman
I can't tell you anymore
If you don't straighten up
I'm gonna walk right out of that door

And if you don't believe me, oh yes
You'll lose a good thing, oh yes
You'll lose a good thing, oh yes, oh yes
You'll lose a good thing, don't you know
