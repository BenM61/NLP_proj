Chew the pill that tastes like hell, but gives you strength
Embrace the drug that makes you mad, cause still it turns you into something else
Feel the need for love grow stronger
Swap your mind for a mirror-search, and shake until the break of day

One day you'll realize that you were wrong
And you'll regret that all this happened
Did it happen?
Some day you'll realize that you were wrong
Left with paranoia as your only friend

Your mind is full of enemies, the room is full of energies
That want to take control
They're all around you, and you're all alone
Your mind is full of enemies, the room is full of energies
Haunting your soul
They're all around you, and you're on your own

One day you'll realize that you were wrong
You'll regret that all this happened
Some day you'll realize that you were wrong
To be left with paranoia
