Sexy mama

Woman, take me in your arms
Rock your baby
Woman, take me in your arms
Rock your baby

There's nothing to it
Just say you want to do it
Open up your heart
And let the loving start

Oh, woman, take me in your arms
Rock your baby
Woman, take me in your arms
Rock your baby

Yeah, hold me tight
With all your might
Now, let your loving flow
Real sweet and slow

Oh, woman, take me in your arms
Rock your baby
Woman, take me in your arms
Rock your baby
