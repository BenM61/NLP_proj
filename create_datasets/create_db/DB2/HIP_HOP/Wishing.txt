Tell me that a dream come true 'cause I'm wishing on a star
Writing our names down in the notebook, like high school
My name first, your name last, you got me feeling like first love
While I work my nine to five, I ain't get nothing done
Steady slacking, tryna find words that describe you

Like wishing upon a star, yeah
Following wherever you are
Swim deep 'cross the deep blue sea, yeah
Just to show the strength of my love, my love, my love

Like the first time making love that leaves you so shook
I slept on you now you know you got me so hooked
Telling you my business and drinking out your glass
Got a long term crush on you and there's no turning back 'cause I'm

Wishing upon a star
And I'm following wherever you are
Swim deep 'cross the deep blue sea
Just to show the strength of my love, my love, my love

You've got me picking at two's off daises
Talking 'bout he loves me, he loves me not
Got me singing the beginnings to happy endings
'Cause we gon' make it, ain't no one who can take it, yeah

Like wishing upon a star
Following wherever you are
Swim deep 'cross the deep blue sea, yeah
Just to show the strength of my love, my love, my love

Like wishing upon a star
Following wherever you are
Swim deep 'cross the deep blue sea
Just to show the strength of my love, ooh yeah

Like wishing upon a star
Following wherever you are
Swim deep 'cross the deep blue sea
Just to show the strength of my love, my love, my love

Like wishing upon a star
Following wherever you are
Swim deep 'cross the deep blue sea
Just to show the strength of my love, my love, my love

Like wishing upon a star
Following wherever you are
Swim deep 'cross the deep blue sea
Just to show the strength of my love, my love, my love
