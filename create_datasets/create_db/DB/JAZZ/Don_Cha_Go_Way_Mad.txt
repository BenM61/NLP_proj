I must confess what you say is true
I had a rendezvous with somebody new
(But) that's the only one I ever had
Baby, baby, don'cha go 'way mad

Cheatin' shows and it never goes
You've got a reason to be mad I suppose
But he only was a passing fad
Baby, don'cha be mad

His kind's a dime a dozen
And that's not the kind I want (I should have past him by)
Who'd ever dream your cousin
Would wander in to that restaurant? (would come along and give us the eye?)

I understand that you feel (you're quite) upset
What do you say, that you forgive and forget?
Come on and kiss me just to show you're glad
Baby, baby (baby, baby), don'cha go 'way mad
(Now don'cha go 'way mad)
