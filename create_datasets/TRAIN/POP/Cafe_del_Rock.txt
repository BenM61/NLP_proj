Downtown anywhere in the USA 
You can find yourself a Hard Rock Cafe 
Put your money on a number anyone can play 
Come on and tell us all about what happened to you today 

At the Hard Rock Cafe 
come to the Hard Rock Cafe 
I hope you can find your way to the Hard Rock Cafe 

After a hard day's work I guarantee 
there just isn't anywhere better to be 
If you're unable to find good company 
You can always sit down and watch the color TV 

At the Hard Rock Cafe 
come to the Hard Rock Cafe 
The regulars can't keep away from the Hard Rock Cafe 

And if you feeling just a little bit lonely 
don't sit at home just hoping 
Come on down to where the spirit flows so free 
You know that door is always open 

At the Hard Rock Cafe 
come to the Hard Rock Cafe 
They will help keep your blues at day at the Hard Rock Cafe
