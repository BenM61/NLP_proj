What the world needs right now!
And I mean right now more than ever!
Is salvation!

The question remains to be answered
Who can save humanity from itself

I have one candidate in mind
A candidate that?d challange all the one way communication

I'm gonna let the music be my language!

Listen!

Toro mikham
Toro mikham
In dele man, kheyli naze to mikhat gole man

Toro mikham
Toro mikham
In dele man, kheyli naze to mikhat azizam 

Ey dele maan, asheghe tam, kashke mishodi faghat maale man

I live by the golden rules, and it should you want to worth this, as you would have to
And to you! and you will soon see that love is all around
To conquer all the manish day in strictly universal, cause music is my language

Toro mikham

In dele man, kheyli naze to mikhat gole man 

Toro mikham

In dele man, kheyli naze to mikhat azizam

Ey dele maan, asheghe tam, kashke mishodi faghat maale man

No more culture clash, if y'all get up and dance, like a wise man said it once!
Give me some chance, do the right thing!
And stop doing all the damage! if you listen when I speak!
I guarantee we hit the peak, I tell you why!

Cause music is language!

Music is my language!
