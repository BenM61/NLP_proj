The sun set in my heart this evenin'
Cause an old friend of mine got lost in the jive
Little did she know, when you're stuck in the snow
Nobody gets out alive

Tears fall gently in my garden
As I wait in vain for my sweet baby to call
I guess what my own brother told me was true
He had been with my sweet baby and she never really loved me at all

Night fell so dark this evenin'
The moon wasn't shinin' nowhere
Sometimes that old light in the alley would light up this old heart of mine
But now I'm wonderin' if there's someone up there who really cares

The night fell darkest in Persia
What used to flow blue is now flowin' black
Many a doctor can try, but only heaven knows why
When it comes to love
Why do some men, why do some men turn their backs?

Can't somebody please tell me?

Maybe the morning air will make me feel better
Oh, I hope better than I feel right now
Last night a stranger took my picture and then he, uh..
He asked if I'd buy it, huh
I said I guess I don't know how

Old, old friends for sale
Get'em while the gettin' is hot
But you better watch out, they'll kiss you until they get what you got
And they'll show you the friends that they're not
