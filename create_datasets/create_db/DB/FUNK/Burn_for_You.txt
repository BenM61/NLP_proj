I got myself into some trouble tonight
Guess I'm just feeling blue
It's been so long since I've seen your face
This distance between me and you

That voice you showed me is not the one I know
I must be strung out on what I do
Don't hang up again
There's nothing else I know how to do

But I burn for you
What am I going to do
I burn for you
Burn for you

I guess it feels like you're always alone
And I feel that way too
It's so hard to explain to you
Please understand what I do

But I burn for you
What am I going to do
I burn for you
Burn for you

Took my trouble to a bar tonight
For another point of view
But there's nothing new
I'm missing you

But I burn for you
What am I going to do
I burn for you
Burn for you
