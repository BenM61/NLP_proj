Here comes a girl with perfect teeth
I bet she won't be smiling at me
I know how jeffry dahmer feels
(Lonely, lonely)

I was awkward as a child blueprint
For my wretched life
Confidence I've been denied
(Lonely, lonely)

Something in my head, it won't switch off when I'm alone
I got a trigger inside, I got a trigger inside
I got a trigger inside, I get the feeling I've been cheated
I got a trigger inside, I got a trigger inside
I got a trigger inside, I get the feeling I've been cheated

My hands are shaking, my head's a mess
Trying to wring some words from my breath
I die before you, you're not impressed
(Lonely, lonely)

I look uglier when I cry
Want to punch that look from your life
One in the eye for the beautiful people
(Lonely, lonely)

Something in my head, it won't switch off when I'm alone
I got a trigger inside, I got a trigger inside
I got a trigger inside, I get the feeling I've been cheated
I got a trigger inside, I got a trigger inside
I got a trigger inside, I get the feeling I've been cheated

I got a trigger inside, I got a trigger inside
I got a trigger inside, I get the feeling I've been cheated
I got a trigger inside, I got a trigger inside
I got a trigger inside, I get the feeling I've been cheated
Cheated, cheated, cheated
