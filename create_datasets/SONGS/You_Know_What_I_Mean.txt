Shouldn't we two be together
You know what I mean
To be with you is something like a dream (you know what I mean)
And if you want me to
I'll bring sunshine to you only

You better stop, take a look about
You know what I mean
If only you could see the dreams that seem to mean so much to me
Then you'd know the reason why
I would love to "I do" than say
Goodbye and let you go forever
Wouldn't we two be together

Can't you see that I want you
For me forever
Wouldn't we two be together

Do you know what I mean, can't you read in between the lines
Sometimes I'm talking and it doesn't seem too clear
But if you have to know
I'm in love if only you know what I mean
