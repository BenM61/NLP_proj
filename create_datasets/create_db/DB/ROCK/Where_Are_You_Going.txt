Where are you going
With your long face
Pullin' down
Don't hide away,
Like an ocean
That you can't see
But you can smell
And the sound of waves crash down.
I am no superman
I have no reasons for you.
I am no hero,
Aw that for sure,
But I do know one thing,
That's where you are is where I belong.
I do know
Where you go, 
Is where I wanta be.

Where are you going,
Where do you go.
Are you looking for answers,
To questions, under the stars
Well if along the way,
You are grown weary,
You can rest with me
Until a brighter day
When you ok.

I am no superman, 
I have no answers for you. 
I am no hero, 
And that's for sure.
But I know one thing,
That's where you are, is where I belong.
I do know 
Where you go,
Is where I want to be.

Where are you going 
Where do you go.

Where do you go.
Where are you going, 
Where do you go.

I am no Superman
I have no answers,
For you.
I am no hero,
Aw that's for sure.
But I do know one thing,
That's where are, 
Is where I belong.
I do know
Where you go,
Is where I wanta be.

Where are you going
Where do you go.

And a where are you going.
Where...lets go!
