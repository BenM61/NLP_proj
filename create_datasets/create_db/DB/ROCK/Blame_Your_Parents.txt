Depressed transparent self will always fail archaic
Man leaves a trail subhuman rubbed in parading
Eyes libido pastures and the drug-nose highs horns
And hooves, quest for death existential vacuum
Becomes a rest memory's lost to pride puppets all
Take up slack single minds won't give it back
Unconscious God broadcast fraud selfish goals
Defer the cost tribal order, suicide superego suckling
Genocide blame your parents' broken image blame
The counter-culture and the global village memory's
Lost to pride Freud was wrong, he told a lie it was child
Abuse and Oedipus should die he milked the brain's
Trance-like state blame your parents memory's lost to pride
