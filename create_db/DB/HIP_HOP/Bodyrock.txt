Shh'
I'm sitting here, wondering where we're gonna go tonight
You are with your boys; I'm with my girls
And you know we're gonna do this right

Let's hit the town and have some fun
Let's take our time 'cause the night is young
I'm in the mood, I want to dance
So come on and give it a chance

that's the end of Friday
Now it's time for Funday
Time to find a party
All my girlies with me
'Cause it's getting real hot
Yeah, you know we don't stop
Till we feel your body rock, till we feel your body rock

And now it's time for us ' to get ready
Time is moving fast ' but we're moving steady
I want to get it on till the early morn
Got my hair done, now it's time to run
I want to hit the dancefloor, everything
Every single move, every different swing
I'm just having fun and enjoying life
Forget about tomorrow 'cause tonight is the night

Let's hit the town and have some fun
Let's take our time 'cause the night is young
I'm in the mood, I want to dance
So come on and give it a chance

that's the end of Friday
Now it's time for Funday
Time to find a party
All my girlies with me
'Cause it's getting real hot
Yeah, you know we don't stop
Till we feel your body rock, till we feel your body rock

(Repeat)
don't stop ' we make your body rock ' Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
don't stop ' give it all you got ' Tymes 4, we make your bodyrock.
don't stop ' we make your body rock ' Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
don't stop ' let's keep it hot ' Tymes 4, we make your bodyrock

Let's hit the town and have some fun
Let's take our time 'cause the night is young
I'm in the mood, I want to dance
So come on and give it a chance
that's the end of Friday
Now it's time for Funday
Time to find a party
All my girlies with me
'Cause it's getting real hot
Yeah, you know we don't stop
Till we feel your body rock, till we feel your body rock

(Repeat until fade)
