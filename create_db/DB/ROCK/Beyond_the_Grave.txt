Are you standing on your own
When the darkness closes in
Can you hear the voices calling from within
Do you see the spirit world
Like a cold and frightened child
Or is you imagination running wild

Is there anybody out there
We're waiting for a sign
Calling to the afterlife
Is anybody there
Beyond the grave

On a breath of cold night air
The candle starts to dim
When shadows dance the walls start closing in
Does your fear begin to rise
Are you paralysed with fright
Can they hear you screaming in the night

Is there anybody out there
We're waiting for a sign
Calling to the afterlife
Is anybody there
Beyond the grave
