There's an old lady living in an old house 
Since her husband died she hasn't been out 
She lives in her own world with her own little nightmares 
And she's stopped counting the days 

She buys a radio station with her husbands legacy 
She does her own show 10 hours a day 
Plays poems and listens lets feelings run free 
Helps people talk their pain away 

So if your world falls down 
Can't see the light of day 
Call the lady call the station today 
And listen 

This is radio orchid listen and cry 
To all the others that suffer and die 
This is radio orchid listen and cry 
Take your lonely heart and let fly 

Sending her message she's solving the problems 
Of millions and millions and who solves hers 
The old lady gets older still lives in her old house 
But when she dies we'll all live alone 

So if your world falls down 
Can't see the light of day 
Call the lady call the station today 

This is radio orchid listen and cry 
To all the others that suffer and die 
This is radio orchid listen and cry 
Take your lonely heart and let fly 

Take your lonely heart and let fly 

So if your world falls down 
Can't see the light of day 
Call the lady call the station today 

This is radio orchid listen and cry 
To all the others that suffer and die 
This is radio orchid listen and cry 
Take your lonely heart and let fly 

Take your lonely heart
