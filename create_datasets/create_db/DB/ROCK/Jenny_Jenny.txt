Jenny, Jenny, Jenny, won't you come along with me
Jenny, Jenny, Jenny, won't you come along with me
You know that I love you, we could live so happily

Jenny, Jenny, Jenny, spinnin' like a spinnin' top
Jenny, Jenny, Jenny, spinnin' like you ain't gonna stop
The greatest little momma you oughta see her reel and rock

Jenny, Jenny, Jenny, won't you come along with me
Jenny, Jenny, Jenny, won't you come along with me
You know that I love you, we could live so happily

Jenny, Jenny, Jenny, girl I need you by my side
Jenny, Jenny, Jenny, you know I need you by my side
You know I need you pretty baby, your ways I gotta really abide now

Jenny, Jenny, Jenny, won't you come along with me
Jenny, Jenny, Jenny, won't you come along with me
You know that I love you, we could live so happily
