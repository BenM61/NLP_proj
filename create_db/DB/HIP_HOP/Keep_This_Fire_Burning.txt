Even when you don't know
I'll be right by your side
Even when you think you're all alone
I'll be by your side, yeah

I'll be right behind you
Keep on going
In whichever way the wind is blowing
I'll be there 'til the
World stops turning
Baby I will keep this fire burning

When nobody else is
I am on your side
Baby when you're not even yourself
I am on your side

I'll be right behind you
Keep on going
In whichever way the wind is blowing
I will be there 'til the
World stops turning
Baby I will keep this fire burning

Even when you've lost your faith in love
Even when there is no light above
Even when you wanna run and hide
I'll be on your side

I don't think you even know
How far I'm about to go
If you put your trust in me
I'll keep it coming
Ain't nobody stopping me
When it comes to you and me
Nothing's like it used to be
I'll keep it coming

I'll be right behind you
Keep on going
In whichever way the wind is blowing
I will be there 'til the
World stops turning
Baby I will keep this fire burning

I don't think you even know
How far I'm about to go
If you put your trust in me
I'll keep it coming
Ain't nobody stopping me
When it comes to you and me
Nothing's like it used to be
I'll keep it coming

I'll be right behind you
Keep on going
In whichever way the wind is blowing
I will be there 'til the
World stops turning
Baby I will keep this fire burning

I will be your sister
I will be your brother
I will be your friend
I will be your lover
I will be your everything, yes I will, yeah
Baby I will keep this fire burning
