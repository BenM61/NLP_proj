The winds will blow
The profits go down
I'm out of work
My daughter will drown
There's stree in my heart
Blood on your hands
Pushing up hill
Against the company man

Well I'm just a hard working corporate slave
My mind should hate what my body does crave
Well I'm just a humble corporate slave
Driving myself into a corporate grave

Its raining
In corporate heaven
All the coffers are a singing
