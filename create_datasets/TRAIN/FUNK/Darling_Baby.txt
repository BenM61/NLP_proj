Darling, baby
Life is so lonely without you
Life is so lonely without you
Since you left these arms of mine

I've been alone, trying
Wondering why you left me behind

Darling, baby
Can't carry on since you've been gone
Why don't you please
Please, come on home

Let's talk it over
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Let's talk it over one more time

Oh, so many nights
I wondered whose holding you tight
Can't help but feel it should be me
Oh, it should be me
Cause I'm forever losing sleep at night

Darling, baby
I've been loving you so long
Tell me what did I do wrong
Come back to these arms of mine

Let's talk it over
Let's talk it over one more time

Darling, baby
This world is empty without you
Keeps me crying with nothing to do
Since you've left these arms of mine

Let's talk it over, baby, baby
One more time

Mmm, darling, baby
