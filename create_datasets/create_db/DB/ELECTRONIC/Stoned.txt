When you're stoned, and I am drunk
And we make love, it seems a little desolate
It's hard sometimes not to look away
And think what's the point
When I'm having to hold this fire down

If you won't let me fall for you
Then you won't see the best that I would love to do for you
Instead you will be missing me when I go
'cause I'm bored of hanging out in your cold

When I feel loved baby, I join the road
And the world moves with me
When I feel lost I just slip away
Silently, quietly take my things and go
And think what's the point
Think where's the hope we're coming home

If you won't let me fall for you
Then you won't see the best that I would love to do for you
Instead you will be missing me when I go
'Cause I'm bored of hanging out in your cold

If you find one day
Find some freedom and relief
And with this freedom maybe
Maybe you will find some peace
And with this baby
I hope it brings you back to me, bring you home, take me home

If you won't let me fall for you
Then you won't see the best that I would love to do for you
Instead you will be missing me when I go
Ccause I'm bored of hanging out in your cold
