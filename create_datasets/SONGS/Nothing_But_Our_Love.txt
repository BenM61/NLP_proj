What I have, what I have
Is nothing that you want
What I lack, what I lack
Nothing but your love
(It's easy)

Don't try, don't try so hard
My love is easy
Don't be the afterglow
These drugs won't leave me

All we have, all we have
Is nothing but our love
(It's easy)

It's easy, your love is easy
And I get more than I deserve
I get more than I deserve
Baby everyone some worth
And we get more than we deserve

Don't try, don't try so hard
My love is easy
Don't be the afterglow
These drugs don't leave me

Don't try so hard
My love is easy
Don't be the afterglow
Your drugs don't leave me
And I get more than I deserve.
