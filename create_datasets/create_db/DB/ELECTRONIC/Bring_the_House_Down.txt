As the night draws in,
Let the game begin (It's a groove thing).
Let your feet decide,
Gonna catch a ride (Keep on moving).
So let's go away,
The mood can't be that hard to reach,
The night will just take us there.

And all you gotta do is,
All you gotta do is

Bring the house down!
Raise the roof and get on the floor,
(House down, raise the roof, get on the floor).
Let's bring the house down,
Really want to hear you shouting more, more, more.
(Really want to hear some more)

You can stay in bed,
With a sleepy head (Doing nothing).
You can always try,
Just to walk on by (It will pull you in).
We're flying away,
We fall into this fantasy
Where the groove will carry us on.
Bridge

Everybody do your thing,
Let's bring the house down.
Everybody spread your wings,
Let's bring the house down.

So let's go away,
The mood can't be that hard to reach,
The night will just take us there.
