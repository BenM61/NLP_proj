Honey, I wouldn't mind
I tell you that you're running round my head
But love is hard to find
I lost you and it's tearing me to shreds.
I don't wanna be your free train coming round
I'm gonna be your

Take me, take me baby
I'm like a hunger,
I could be a singer,
Let me push you under,
Don't want no other baby,
I got you covered
Our love is growing and getting younger
Oh, oh, oh still getting younger!
Oh, oh, oh still getting younger!

Baby I'm a bridge between this huge divide
Baby I'ma be your astronaut,
Bring you back to Earth sometime!

Take me, take me baby
I'm like a hunger,
I could be a singer,
Let me push you under,
Don't want no other baby,
I got you covered
Our love is growing and getting younger
Oh, oh, oh still getting younger!
Oh, oh, oh still getting younger!

I'm not lonely, I just need you
Through this empty space again
I complete you and you could never turn me away!
Our love will never end!

I love to hear you say my name
Calling out to me like a record
Promise you'll always be the same

Take me, take me baby
I'm like a hunger,
I could be a singer
Let me push you under,
Don't want no other baby,
I got you covered
Our love is growing and getting younger
Oh, oh, oh

Take me, take me baby
I'm like a hunger,
I could be a singer
Let me push you under,
Don't want no other baby,
I got you covered
Our love is growing and getting younger
Oh, oh, oh
