I want to got to cool places with you
I want to take you cool places tonight
I want to go where nobody's a fool
And no one says uh, "Hey girl, need a light?"

I want to move like this and that
A minimum of chit chat
I never want to cool down, cool down, cool cool cool,
Cool places tonight

I gotta tell you, you're lookin' real good
They let us in so I'm feelin' all right
I like to go where sometimes they refuse
Yeah, I remember last Saturday night

But I'm feeling cooler now
And they could tell we're cooler now
It's obvious we're cooler now, cooler now, cool cool cool,
Cool places tonight

I want to go, I want to go, etc.
I want to go to cool places tonight
I want to go to cool places with you

And after that we'll slip out for a bite
A coffee shop, and toast, coffee and juice
And then we'll sleep 'til 5 p.m.
And start it up all over again
I never want to cool down, cool down, cool cool cool

I want to go, I want to go, etc.
I want to go to cool places tonight
I want to go to cool places with you
