Sprawled across the bedroom floor
 Dripping sweat from every pore
Helplessly you reach for me
But I'm already, I'm already gone
Don't you look beautiful?
 Where's that smirk I've had to face
 Crawled away in sweet disgrace
Now you say you need me so
Don't tell me what I already know
Don't you look beautiful?
Don't you look beautiful
 begging me to finish what I start
 Open mouth and aching fingers
Bloodshot eyes so filled with fear
If only you could see yourself from here
 Don't you look beautiful?
 Don't you look beautiful?
Don't you look beautiful
 begging me to finish what I start
 Don't you look beautiful?
 Isn't it beautiful
 begging me to finish what I start
 begging me to finish what I start
