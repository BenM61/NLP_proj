Sometimes, lonely nights turn into sunny days
I never thought I'd feel this way
I never knew that you and I
Were meant to be in love
Oh, darling, you've always been around
To see me through
How was I to know
You'd make my dreams come true?
Time and time again before, always on our own 
But now we're friends in love

Hoping that we'll always
Still be friends in love
It's dawn and we're together
Darling, now we got forever and day
Don't you go away

Remember every time you cried
You came to me
Much to my surprise, I found someone to see
Even nights of loneliness
You were always there for me
We're friends in love

You turned around, looked my way
I can't say that it hasn't crossed my mind
I've loved you all along
Ah now we're leavin' yesterday behind
We'll never be alone
We're friends in love
