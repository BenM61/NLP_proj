Could I be the one that you're thinking of
My goal is to be the one you're dreaming of 
I wanna be a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
Trust me and I'll never let you down

Let me be with you through all your hard times
I wanna be around when the ?
It'll be me and you, I can see our position
Can't you see our love shinning through?

You've been there to solve all of my problems
You've been there to help me solve them
I don't know what, I don't know what you do to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Could I be the one?
Trust me with your dreams, I'll make them all come true
For the rest of my life, I'll be grateful to you
Time will pass, our love will last
I'll spend my life cherishing you

Let me be the one
Let me be the one in your life at the end of the rainbow
Let me be the one
Let me be the one that you love so
Late at night, the time is right
I wanna be the one you just think is out of sight

Let me be the one
Let me be the one, let you be the girl
Let me be the one
Let me be, let me be the one at the end of the rainbow
Oh, I'll never, never, never, let you done

Let me be the one, let me be the one
Oh, talk to me girl, let me be the one, be the one, oh yeah
At the end of the rainbow, I'll never, never, never let you down
Let me be the one, let me be the one
