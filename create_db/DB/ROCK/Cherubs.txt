I see cherubs swarm around the bed and swooping down to kiss your head. 
Only when you're wrecked do you agree with all my plans for you and me. 
The walls breathe we're locked tight
It's a lovely end to an ugly night. 
I think I could burst but I'm sure it'll keep. 
The strobe in my head keeps me from sleep.
