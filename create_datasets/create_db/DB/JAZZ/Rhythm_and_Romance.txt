Rhythm and romance
Romance and rhythm
Taught me to sparkle anew
Brought me dream-of-able you
Sweetheart

Rhythm and romance
Romance and rhythm
An inconceivable pair
That gave our budding affair
Its start

The stars gleam
The moon beams
The skies seem to smile
The breeze flies
A tree sighs
Please stay around a while

Rhythm and romance
Romance and rhythm
A combination so real
An invitation to steal
Your heart

Now the stars gleam
The moon beams
The skies seem to smile
Oh, the breeze flies
A tree sighs
Please, stay around a while

Rhythm and romance
Romance and rhythm
A combination so real
Oh, oh, an invitation to steal
Your heart
