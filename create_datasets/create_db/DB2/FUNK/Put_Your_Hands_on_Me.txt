One, two, three

I guess I'm picky with love
Oh, baby, I give up: it's you I choose
And don't keep me waiting
This girl got things she needs to do
If I was blind, you'll help me see
If I lost my mind, you'll find it for me
Speak on it, babe, tell me, what do you need?
Because sometimes I need you to love me, baby

(Put your hands on me, baby)
Put your hands on me, baby
You got me flipping
(Put your hands on me, baby)
Put your hands on me, baby

Can't stop my mind from thinking of ya
How am I supposed to function?
Got me feigning for your lips on my kiss all night
I never want no other lover
Baby, I'm hungry; I want, and I need
Bring me your sugar and pour it all over me, baby

(Put your hands on me, baby)
Put your hands on me, baby
You got me flipping
(Put your hands on me, baby)
Put your hands on me, baby

One taste, I'm tripping
Up till now my eyes could see
Touch me once and it's all hazy
I don't know why, and I don't know how
But somehow, someway you get me

I can't explain, can't comprehend
The world can reach this very end
And all our focus is on him
The way he moves - he found his groove
There's nothing left to do but
Tell the world the truth
'Cause there's now way out
I love him
I feel him
Uh, I'm loving those hands
Put your hands on me, baby

(Put your hands on me, baby)
Put your hands on me, baby
You got me flipping
(Put your hands on me, baby)
Put your hands on me, baby

Just kiss me, baby
Tell me you're mine
Put your hands on me, baby
Put your hands on me, baby
You got me flipping
One more time
Put your hands on me, baby
Put your hands on me, baby
One taste, I'm trippin'
Just kiss me, baby, tell me you're mine
Put your hands on me, baby
