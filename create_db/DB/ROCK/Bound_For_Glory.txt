Johnny Wong keeps trying to get it right
Way down in Suckerville tonight
When darkness falls in the neon lights
He feels like walking dynamite
And he knows he could never win
He's just trying to lose a little more slowly

Bound for glory (Bound for glory)
The lost but never lonely
Bound for glory (Bound for glory)
Bound for livin' on the edge
Bound for glory (Bound for glory)
The righteous and unholy
Desperation always tells a story

I would have rebuilt Jericho
For nights as good as this
Another shot of redemption
And it's taste in every kiss
Elvis in the backroom, Jesus on the wall
Mary's on the whiskey, there's shadows in the hall

Bound for glory (Bound for glory)
The lost but never lonely
Bound for glory (Bound for glory)
Bound for livin' on the edge
Bound for glory (Bound for glory)
The righteous and unholy
Desperation always tells a story

We all know we can never win
We're all trying to lose a little more slowly
We gotta get through this world, free or die tryin'
Ride that downtown train hell-bound for glory

Bound for glory (Bound for glory)
The lost but never lonely
Bound for glory (Bound for glory)
Bound for livin' on the edge
Bound for glory (Bound for glory)
The righteous and unholy
Desperation always tells a story
