She's an automatic,
He's a cosmic man,
They will get together.
They should know better by now.

The meet in a garden
Down in old Japan
Where young love's forbidden;
You've got to keep it hidden.

Modern love is automatic,
Modern love is automatic.

Modern love is automatic,
Modern love is automatic.

They locked him away
For twenty years they say.
You won't see him again,
But I know diff'rent.

Modern love is automatic,
Modern love is automatic,
Modern love is automatic,
Modern love is automatic,
Modern love is automatic,
Modern love is
Automatic,
Automatic,
Automatic,
Automatic,
Automatic,
Automatic,
Automatic.
