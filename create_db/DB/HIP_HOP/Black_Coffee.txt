I need a girl who ain't scared to scrap
Someone who got my back
Gotta be a dark skin a light skin
Like the type of girl that stays busy all day
But when the sun goes down
She's my sexy souffle
Somebody real who ain't afraid to work it
If you try to disrespect her face
Around and get her feelings hurt
She ain't ? from your ? ? ? ?
She'll only flex with a brother that can handle it, a
And I don't care if she's a little bit jealous
She can still be a lady while she's coolin' with the fellas
An intellectual, beautiful, sexual
Hands on her hip and when she flips she's incredible
Candlelight ? from her mack
But she's a trooper if she has to spill the beans from the can
A very nice girl but not mistaken for no softy
And that's the way I like it, yeah, my black coffee

Black coffee got the flip like a mitten
Roars like a lion and when I stroke her kitten
Versatile when the coke gets mine
She got a positive style ain't had none in a while
Party animal but Biggie only when she with me
And I don't have to worry 'cause she won't disrespect me
She's everything that a man dreams about
And when I'm with my crew she's all I talk about, hey
Fancy here, jewels all flushed
Backside bigger than a mob but don't touch her
Prettiest girl she know the ones with the slip
A closet full of gear so you know she stay ??
Body so smooth from using plenty lotion
Perfume smelling like some old sex potion

And that's the way I want it, yeah, my black coffee

Part of ? Afro-American dream

Appreciate the fact that you never miss a step
The backbone of the black bone here's to ya
As long as I'm around believe me none could ever do ya

And that's why I love ya, you're my black coffee
