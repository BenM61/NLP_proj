Imagine I was good again, but you still see me the same
And baby, why can't you pretend that nothing here has changed?
Let's rewind, we'll be fine!
You'll forgive me, believe that I'm sorry!
'Cause your eyes will be fine,
Come back inside, there's no need to worry!

I need you to use use use use use use your imagination
I need you to use use use use use use your imagination
No no no don't tell me that you're leaving
I need you to use use use use use use your imagination

Imagine you remember me, let yourself believe a word I say
See everybody makes mistakes, and if you may believe we'll go away
Let's rewind, we'll be fine,
You'll forgive me, believe that I'm sorry
'Cause your eyes will be fine,
Come back inside, there's no need to worry!

I need you to use use use use use use your imagination
I need you to use use use use use use your imagination
No no no don't tell me that you're leaving
I need you to use use use use use use your imagination

Come, close to me, tell me what you want me to do!
What you're imagining, but you let me softly to change your mind
Change your mind!
No holding, babe, I've been waiting so patiently,
No need to say, come with me before our time runs out
Our time runs out!

I need you to use use use use use use your imagination
I need you to use use use use use use your imagination
No no no don't tell me that you're leaving
I need you to use use use use use use your imagination
