Just married this mornin'.
How happy they are.
"Just Married" written on
The window of a-their car.
It broke my heart
To see them drive away.
I lost the one I love today.

Dressed all in white satin,
White lace in her hair.
She looked so lovely
It was more than I could bear.
Some people guessed the way that I felt
They saw the tears I could not hide.

Just married this mornin'.
How happy they are.
"Just Married" written on
The window of a-their car.
It broke my heart
To see them drive away.
I lost the one I love today.

I should have stayed at home.
I knew what was in store,
But somethin' made me come
To see her just once more.

Just married this mornin'.
How happy they are.

To see them drive away.

To see them drive away.
