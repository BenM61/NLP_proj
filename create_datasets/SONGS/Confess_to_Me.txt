I can help you run away for good
All for take what you had understood
All it takes is a little understanding
After all, don't question if I would

Confess to me, make me feel it
Confide in me, don't resent it
'Cause I can't stop you from the fire
I'll fulfill your desires for you

Confess to me, make me feel it
Confide in me, don't resent it
'Cause I can't stop you from the fire
I'll fulfill your desires for you

I'll fulfill your desires for you
I'll fulfill your desires for you

I can take the low out of lonely
I can stop the sense of slowing down
Don't get lost in if you only tell me
I will help you slip and turn it round

Only not to worry
No time left for me
Only not to worry
No time left for me

Only not to worry
No time left for me
Only not to worry
No time left for me

Confess to me, make me feel it
Confide in me, don't resent it
'Cause I can't stop you from the fire
I'll fulfill your desires for you

Confess to me, make me feel it
Confide in me, don't resent it
'Cause I can't stop you from the fire
I'll fulfill your desires for you

I'll fulfill your desires for you
I'll fulfill your desires for you
I'll fulfill your desires for you
I'll fulfill your desires for you
