When will I get see you again
You're running right through my veins
And I just can't escape you
Baby, I don't want no one else
I feel you like a beating pulse
Beating on my body

Come close, baby
Show me what you want no
If you wanna love me
Then don't you waste time
I don't care where we're going
'Cause I'm yours for the night
So turn down all the light
Yeah, turn 'em out

I always feel like somebody's watching me
So tell me when the lights go out
Tell me if it's safe now
I always feel like somebody's watching me
So tell me when the lights go out
Tell me if it's safe now

Ooh ooh ooh
Tell me when the lights go out
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Tell me when the lights go out
Ooh ooh ooh

You've got me going mad in my mind
Thinking about it all the time
I'm only trying to find you
And I know
We could have a little fun
No one needs to know
Only if you want to

Come close, baby
Show me what you want no
If you wanna love me
Then don't you waste time
I don't care where we're going
'Cause I'm yours for the night
So turn down all the light
Yeah, turn em out

I always feel like somebody's watching me
So tell me when the lights go out
Tell me if it's safe now
I always feel like somebody's watching me
So tell me when the lights go out
Tell me if it's safe now

Ooh ooh ooh
Tell me when the lights go out
Ooh ooh ooh
Tell me if it's safe now
Tell me when the lights go out
Ooh ooh ooh
Tell me when the lights go out
Ooh ooh ooh
Tell me when the lights go out

Come close, baby
Show me what you want, no
If you wanna love me
Then don't you waste time
