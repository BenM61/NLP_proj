Dance dance on little girl
In the arms of someone new
As you dance as you twirl
My heart dances with you

Dance dance on little girl
Tell me what I've done wrong
Why should he hold you tight
While they're playing our song

I am watching you
Oh no no it cannot be
While I'm watching you
I'm wishing, hoping it's for me

Dance dance on little girl
Tell me why did we part
Dance dance on little girl
Dance out of my heart

I am watching you
Oh no no it cannot be
While I'm watching you
I'm wishing, hoping it's for me

Dance dance on little girl
Tell me why did we part
Dance dance on little girl
Dance out of my heart
Oh look at you
There you go go go
Oh yes you know
That you're wrong wrong wrong...
