I believe what you say when you say you're goin' steady with nobody else but me
I believe what you say when you say you don't kiss nobody else but me

 When you're rockin' with me don't rock too slow
 a-Move on in, get toe-to-toe
 We're gonna rock till we can't rock no more

 Chills run all up and down my spine
 I'm tellin' everybody that you're mine, all mine
