Flowers mean forgiveness, I heard a poet say,
When you need forgiveness, you give her a bouquet,
Flowers mean forgiveness, my darling, here I stand,
Asking your forgiveness, with flowers in my hand.
As sure as I was wrong when I made you cry,
I know that you'd be wrong if you say goodbye.
Take these lovely flowers, or they'll be lonely too.
Flowers mean forgiveness, forgive me, say you do.
