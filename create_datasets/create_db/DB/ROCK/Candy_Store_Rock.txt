Don't you want a man like me? 
Oh baby baby, I'm just as sweet as anybody could be 
Oh baby baby, I want to look to your eyes, of blue 
Oh baby baby, it's more than anybody else could do

Oh baby baby, well you lookin' good enough to eat 
Oh baby baby, I don't believe I've tasted this before 
Oh baby baby, I want it now 
And every mouthful more of you

Talk about you, yeah

Sugar sister on a silver plate
