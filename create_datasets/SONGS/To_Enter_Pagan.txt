Moonlight bathes my heart
The birds sing my serenade
The trees are whispering my
Name... my name

Dark romanticism, of a
Kind seen no more...
Lament my name when I am
Gone... remember me

These years of indifference
Have poured solitude on my soul
Ice cold my skin...
Can fires of the past

Make me once a warrior
To fight the light...
I am of the earth
My soul is as old as stone

Runetongue... speak my name
Long when winter has passed
To be at one with the earth
To be at one with what was...

... my earth...
We are as of one womb
Those whose minds may reach the clouds
