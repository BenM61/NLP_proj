Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, 
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, 
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do

From the moment that I see you
Chills run down my spine
Your smile is mesmerizin'
And soothes me like sweet wine

(Ooh) With you is where it's warmer
I never want to leave
So come on, girl, let's closer
I want to breathe when you breathe

You make me shiver
Girl, your love is such a sweet sensation, ho, ho
You make me shiver
Baby, when you're here with me it's fascination

You make me shiver
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, 
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Shiver
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, 
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do

When we're dancing close together
Wrapped up in a bliss
My heart is racing and , baby
The magic in your kiss

(Ooh) We share a special feeling
I hope the music never ends, mmm?
New love takes on a new meaning
Girl, let's move across the floor across again

You make me shiver
Girl, your love is such a sweet sensation, ho, ho
You make me shiver
Baby, when you're here with me it's fascination

You make me shiver
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, 
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Shiver
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, 
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do

Come on, take me, I'm ready for this ecstasy
I've been waitin' forever
Feels so real, better than a fantasy
When we're so close together

Ooh, yeah
Mm, mm

Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, 
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, 
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, 
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, 
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, 
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do

You make me shiver
Girl, you're love is such a sweet sensation, sensation, girl
You make me shiver
Baby, when you're here with me it's fascination

You make me shiver
Ho! girl, your love is such a sweet sensation
You make me shiver
Baby, baby, when you're here with me it's fascination

You make me shiver
You make me shiver, shiver, shiver, shiver, baby, quiver, quiver, baby
You make me shiver
You make me shiver, girl
