Systematic rhythm in control 
Has left me in a world without emotion in my soul 
And my desire, oh, it feels like fire. 
Electrifying energy of life 
Generates a power to a beat as cold as ice 
And my desire, it takes you higher, higher, higher 

Oh yeah yeah  

Automatic songs that fascinate 
Dancin' in a trance, my mind and body activated 
My desire, oh, it feels like fire. (yeah!) 
Accelerate the feeling everywhere 
Electronic pleasure makes the music fill the air 
And my desire, it takes you higher, higher, higher 

Get ready ta flex, 
I'll make you bounce to these rough raw rhythm 
in your mind and the yalaxies. 
Cause in the '95 season size in a roll, 
Pass the remote control. 
So I can change it up, 
I get a ten'n'a half for mashing the bass up, 
And it don't matter what they say 
I'm like a Pentium chip and every line carries 8 k 
I come with the digital, electric pleasure, 
Here comes the pressure. 
Known to be the man on the jams on the street fighter. 
2 cause my style kicks like kung fu
Or you can get open, I got a fat PC with a 14,4 modem 
Now here comes the pressure, 
My interpretation of electronic pleasure

The hottest songs from N-Trance
