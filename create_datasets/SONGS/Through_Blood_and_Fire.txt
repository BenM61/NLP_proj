(THE GODHEAD:)
I am the Master of this World of Ours
You are a Thorn in my side I am the Rock upon which you will break
Freedom or Death, you decide
For in the End there is no meaning to find
Only the Raging Sea and I will be there at the Door

(HUMANITY:)
THROUGH BLOOD AND FIRE - promises and lies
THROUGH BLOOD AND FIRE - we rise No more tomorrow on your side
THROUGH BLOOD AND FIRE - we rise

(ENDYAMON:)
Shatter the Sky with your
Thunder and Wrath To Honour the Questions we ask
Greatness is granted to those who betray I am the
Last of my kind Heaven and Hell exist inside us we've found
Drown in your Raging Sea for I will be there when you DIE ! ! ! ! ! ! !

(HUMANITY:)
THROUGH BLOOD AND FIRE - promises and lies
THROUGH BLOOD AND FIRE - we rise No more tomorrow, Deiceit
THROUGH BLOOD AND FIRE - we rise

THROUGH BLOOD AND FIRE - promises and lies
THROUGH BLOOD AND FIRE - we rise No more tomorrow on your side
THROUGH BLOOD AND FIRE - promises and lies
THROUGH BLOOD AND FIRE - we rise
No more tomorrow on your side
THROUGH BLOOD AND FIRE - WE RISE ! ! !
