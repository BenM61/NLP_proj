Look in the mirror time to face up
Ever tried to live without the photographs and money
Don't have to live behind the makeup
'cause all I want is what's itching inside of you 

'cause I saw you sitting in the rain with the tears running down, running down your face
It makes me shiver when I see you like this
But just open you're eyes and watch it fade away
'cause I saw you sitting in the rain with the tears running down, running down your face
Can't you see it's a masquerade so get yourself together

Plug it in, plug it in baby
Where you been, where you been baby
Plug it in, plug it in baby
Where you been, where you been baby

I wouldn't say that its so serious
I know you think your in a tragic condition
You know that I'm a little bit more than curious
When all I want is what's kicking inside of you

'cause I saw you sitting in the rain with the tears running down, running down your face
It makes me shiver when I see you like this
But just open your eyes and watch it fade away
'cause I saw you sitting in the rain with the tears running down, running down your face
Can't you see it's a masquerade so get yourself together

Plug it in, plug it in baby
Where you been, where you been baby
Plug it in, plug it in baby
Where you been, where you been baby

Ever tried to live without the makeup

Plug it in, plug it in baby
Where you been, where you been baby
Plug it in, plug it in baby
Where you been, where you been baby

Just plug it in,
Just plug it in
Just be yourself babe
Be yourself
