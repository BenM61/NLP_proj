A ladder of light, the stars are behind me
A place where the clock stand still
Each whisper you're breathing will find me
And our hearts move at will

Every step is pulling you closer
To the promise that led me here
Take our lives to the edge and over, yeah
To a place where we hardly feel

Feel
Feel

To the end we'll fight the sunrise
You're the light inside of me
And I can see the world in your eyes
I've been waiting far too long
For a night like this

For a night like this

To the end we'll fight the sunrise
You're the light inside of me
And I can see the world in your eyes
I've been waiting far too long
For a night like this
