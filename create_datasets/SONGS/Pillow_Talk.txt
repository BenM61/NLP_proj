Hey baby, let me stay.
I don't care what your friend's about to say.
Aha, What your friends all say is fine,
But it can't compete with this pillow talk of mine.
Oh you can't find love on a one way street.
It takes two to tango, takes two to even compete.
Oh yeah. So boy just put that stop sign down,
And let's get together before the day runs us down.

I'm pleading to you now,
Hey baby, Let me try,
To be the one who's gonna light your fire.
Aha, What your friends all say is fine,
But it can't compete with this pillow talk of mine.
Oh I don't want to see you be no fool.
What I'm teachin' you tonight, boy, you never learned it in school.
Oh no. Some friends who tell me wrong from right,
I'll ask to borrow their pad some cold and lonely night.

Hey baby, let me be,
The one who turns you on from a to z.
Aha, What your friends all say is fine,
But it can't compete with this pillow talk of mine.

Oh baby,
Oh Oh baby,
La la la,
La la la la.

Ah wouldja baby'
Wouldja baby'
La la la,
La la la la.

Ly, Iy, Iy, Iy, Iiiiyiiyiiyii

Oh little poochito,
Oh oh little poochito,
Liiiyiiyiiyii

Lie study,
Lie study,
Lie study,
Lie study,
Liiiyiiyiiyii

Oh my God!
