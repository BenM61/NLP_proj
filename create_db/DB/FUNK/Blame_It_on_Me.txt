Leaves change from green to red,
Without notes in tune with the time that surrounds.
I think that's something that you said,
Back a while, when you first started coming around.
You and I are from different worlds,
But that just gave us more to share.
You'd ask me where I wanted to be,
And I was happy with you just being there.
Now I feel we've got some serious talking ahead,
And I don't want you to get me wrong.
It's just we've become kind of a habit to each other,
And this can't keep going on.
Blame it on me.
Over the past few months, through no fault of your own,
I've grown disenchanted and I've got to go it alone.
Seems the natural thing to do,
'Cause you can't cling to me
If I'm not gonna stick with you.
Now take a look at what it's all coming down to.
You act like I'm leaving you on the shelf.
I don't know how else to say it;
Life's a game and we all got to play it.
So I've got to look out for myself.
Blame it on me.
All these changes coming on,
And I'm feeling it so strong.
You know they've got to be real.
It's hard to explain it, baby.
I don't know if I can make it, baby,
If I can't tell you how I feel.
I've been pushing it aside,
But I can't sacrifice my pride any longer.
I thought it would subside,
Something I could hide,
But it's only getting stronger.
Blame it on me.
