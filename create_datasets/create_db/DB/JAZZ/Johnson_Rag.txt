Johnson Flood Mississippi 
Mud Black Bottom I got 'em
Lindy Hop Chop chop chop 
Ch-ch-ch Charlotte Russe Turn on the juice
 
Hep Hep there goes the Johnson Rag 
Hoy Hoy there goes the latest shag 
Ho Ho it really isn't a gag
Hep Hep there goes the Johnson Rag
Jump Jump don't let your left foot drag
Jeep Jeep it's like a game of tag
Juke Juke it's even good for a stag    
Jump jump and do the Johnson Rag
 
If your feelin' in the groove 
It sends you out of the world
Funny how it makes you move
I don't wanna coax
But don't be a "Mokes"
Zig Zig Then add a Zig Zig Zag 
Zoop Zoop just let your shoulders wag
Zoom Zoom and now it's right in the bag 
Get hep And get happy with the Johnson Rag
