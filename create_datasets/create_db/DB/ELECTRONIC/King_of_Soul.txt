If you don't listen up, you're askin' to be told
If you had a walk like mine, you'd crown it the king of soul

Maybe I don't want it
You take anybody
I can't afford it
Shake hardening like a fire

Too many body swerves and lose control
I wonder, am I right or am I gettin' old?
My eyes have seen the glory but my body's on hold
I hope I get to Heaven before the devil knows I'm cold Mr Jack

The hungry feed my only hole
'Cause if you had a head like mine you'd crown it the king of soul

Shake my Bible
Walk on my hands
Rub out making your first mistake I've been told
Maybe I won't like it

If you won't listen up, you're askin' to be told
If you had a head like mine you'd crown it the king of soul

Too many body swerves and find control
I wonder am right or I'm getting too old?
'Till my eyes have seen the glory but my body's still on hold
I hope I get to Heaven before the devil knows I'm cold Mr Jack

The hungry feed my only hole
'Cause if you had a head like mine you'd crown it the king of soul
