You're all I have in this teenage twilight
Your golden hair and pale blue eyes
But through all the days
And the sleepless nights
We have never been satisfied
Tumbling like the leaves 
We are spiraling on the breeze
Almost to the point of no return
Everything will burn baby burn

Look into my tired eyes
See someone you don't recognize
Binds that can't be untied
This is slow suicide
Feelings that I can't disguise
Never will be reconciled
Something inside has died

You walk like you're in a daze
Unresponsive eyes in a distant gaze
Like all the good times have flown away
And their memory leaves a bitter taste
Tumbling like the leaves
We are spiraling on the breeze
Destructive love is all we have
Destructive love is all I am

Look into my tired eyes
See someone you don't recognize
Binds that can't be untied
This is slow suicide
Feelings that I can't disguise
Never will be reconciled
Something inside has died

Vicious bitter words 
Becoming more and more cruel
But you always take me back
And let me lick your wounds

Tumbling like the leaves
We are spiraling on the breeze
Almost to the point of no return
Everything will burn baby burn

Look into my tired eyes
See someone you don't recognize
Binds that can't be untied
This is slow suicide
Feelings that I can't disguise
We're living in a compromise
Something inside has died
