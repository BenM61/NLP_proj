What makes this world go round
Will the answer let her down
She is so sweet and young
And her life has just begun
What does her future hold
That's a story left unknown
Will she make it through her days
Let our love lead the way

Part of me laughs (ooh)
Part of me cries
Part of me wants to question why (question why)
Why is there joy
Why is there pain
Why is there sunshine then the rain (one day)
One day you're here
Next you are gone
No matter what we must go on
Just keep the faith and
Let love lead the way

Everything will work out fine
If you let love 
Love lead the way
Sitting there all alone
In the window of her room
Watching the world go by
Brings tears to her eyes
All she sees is hurt and pain
And she wants to break the chains
She'll keep pressing every day
And she'll find her own sweet way

Part of me laughs
Part of me cries (I cry)
Part of me wants to question why
Why is there joy
Why is there pain (so much pain)
Why is there sunshine then the rain
One day you're here
Next you are (you're) gone
No matter what we must go on (I will go on)
Just keep the faith and (keep your faith) 
Let love lead the way 
(I know I know I know oh oh)

You can be all that 
And still can be who you are
You've got to know for sure 
That it isn't make believe
You may feel weak 
But you are strong
Don't you give up girl
If you keep holding on 
You'll never be wrong
Just close your eyes 
'Cause it lies deep in your heart, yeah

Part of me laughs
Part of me cries (I cry)
Part of me wants to (I do) question why (I do)
Why is (yeah yeah) there joy (oh)
Why is there pain (why is it)
Why is there (why is it) sunshine then the rain
One day you're here (you're here)
Next you're are gone (are gone)
No matter what we must go on (we must keep)
Just keep the faith and
Let love lead (love lead) the way (the way)

Everything will work out fine
If you let love 
Let love lead the way
Love lead the way
