For I bring a little white gardenia
As refreshing as a day in May
You may wear it if you care
Or toss it away

If you look into this white gardenia
There's a message there I dare not say
That I'll let this little white gardenia convey.

Who knows tomorrow we may be
Together or so far apart
Take this token of my love
Cherish it and keep it close to your heart

If our paths should ever cross again dear
Accidentally, or by fate designed
If you wear a little white gardenia
I'll know you are mine.

Who knows tomorrow we may be
Together or so far apart
Take this token of my love
Cherish it and keep it close to your heart

If our paths should ever cross again dear
Accidentally, or by fate designed
If you wear a little white gardenia
I'll know you are mine.
