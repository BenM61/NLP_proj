Abide with me from the morning till the evening
Abide with me when the night is high
Be my last sight and sweet to rest
Forever on your warm decaying breast

See you blind
Behold your savior's come
Dance for death
You lame in the morning fires

And be a ghost in the sky
A ghost in the sky
Be a ghost in the sky
A ghost in the sky

When grace has purified my blindness
It could be fresh and new and glorious
Will my bleeding ears be rung with joy
Or are they just plain spent and well destroyed

See you blind
Behold your savior's come
Dance for death
You lame in the morning fires

And be a ghost in the sky
A ghost in the sky
Be a ghost in the sky
A ghost in the sky

Be a ghost in the sky
A ghost in the sky
Be a ghost in the sky
A ghost in the sky

Be a ghost in the sky
Be a ghost in the sky
Be a ghost in the sky
