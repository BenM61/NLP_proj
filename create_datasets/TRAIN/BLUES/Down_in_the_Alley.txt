I met a man, asked me did I want to pally 
Yes, baby, let's go down in the alley 
Take me down in the alley 
Take me down in the alley 
Take me down in the alley 
I can get any business fixed all right 
I met another man, asked me for a dollar 
Might have heard that mother fucker holler 
Let's go down in the alley 
Let's go down in the alley 
Let's go down in the alley 
You can get your business fixed all right 
Let's go 
When he got me in the alley, he called me a name 
What I put on him was a crying shame 
Down in this alley 
Down in this alley 
Down in this alley 
Where I got my business fixed all right 
You got me in the alley, but don't get rough 
I ain't gonna put up with that doggone stuff 
Way down in the alley 
Way down in the alley 
Way down in the alley 
Lord, my business fixed all right 
Woo, it's dark 
Can't see no light 
Got to feel my way out this alley 
I'm gonna stop, boys, walking late at night) 
You took me in the alley, you knocked me down 
Now I'm gonna call every copper in this town 
You got me down in the alley 
You got me down in the alley 
You got me down in the alley 
Now you got your business fixed all right 
Boys, I'm sure gonna stop walking, 
Walking late at night
