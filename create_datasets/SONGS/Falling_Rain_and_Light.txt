Pray the wild
Pray for sanity
Pray like falling rain and light

Pray that someone
Frees the sin of fear
For the times when seas of light were here

And I need you
Oh oh
And I need you

Pray that seasons
Sees us through these days of loss
Safe from storms oh and leave us here

Pray us wild
Pray us softly
Pray us safe unto the seas we know
Oh

And I need you
Oh oh
And I need you

Oh oh
And I need you
Oh oh
And I need you
Oh oh
And I need you
Oh oh
And I need you
Oh oh
Oh oh
And I need you
Oh oh
And I need you
