Children carry through the streets
A brilliant painted star
Angels gather 'round the hearth
Strumming on guitars
Men of great renown and faith
Say prayers on boulevards
It's the night before Christmas

But you don't have to be an angel
To sing harmony
And you don't have to be a child
To love the mystery
And you don't have to be a wise man
On bended knee
The heart of this Christmas is in you and me

The night before Christmas
The night before Christmas

If you're heart's been longing
And you've been afraid to try
Sorrow's kept you company
And the dance has passed you by
I'll lift you up and blaze with you
Across the moonlit sky
On the night before Christmas

'Cause you don't have to be an angel
To sing in harmony
And you don't have to be a child to love the mystery
And you don't have to be a wise man
On bended knee

The heart of this Christmas is in you and me
The heart of this Christmas is in you and me

The night before Christmas
The night before Christmas
