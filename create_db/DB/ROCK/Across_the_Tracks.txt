Across the tracks there's a girl who loves me
Just as much as I love her
We are unified still crucified
Just because we live across the tracks, yeah

White or black, day or night
What's the difference when you've hurt someone?
You can walk tall, you can act small
Any fool can fire a gun

Across the tracks there's a girl who loves me
Just as much as I love her
We are unified still crucified
Just because we live across the tracks, yeah alright yeah

So we slip away and pretend to play
And it said how families make you run
If my daddy ever caught me kissing her
I believe he would shoot his son

But we're growin' up and there'll come a day
When the real world makes us run away
Now we live in shame and play their silly game
Soon we'll be gone and I don't have to say, yeah

Across the tracks there's a girl who loves me
Just as much as I love her
We are unified still we're crucified
Just because we live across the tracks, yeah

Across the tracks, across the tracks
We won't stand forever across the tracks
Across the tracks, across the tracks, oh
