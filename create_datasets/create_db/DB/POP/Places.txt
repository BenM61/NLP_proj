We've named everything
From the ground to the walls,
Climbed every mountain,
And turned every stone there was to find there.

We conquered the deep
Still looking for more
Trooped through the east, the south,
The west and the north

We built the machines,
The trains, the planes,
The cars of our dreams to reach out
For places, no one can find

We figured it out
Creation and god
Imposed our beliefs cause they're better than yours
Don't you know it?

Perfectionned our weapons
But we still need more,
To balance our peace,
We're selling you war can you afford it

We're ten for a seat,
And we're still growing more,
It's a brave new world that I'm heading for,
Have you read it?
