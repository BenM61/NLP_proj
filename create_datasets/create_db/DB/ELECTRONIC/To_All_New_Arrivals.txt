If there's a God, be aware, I'm a man newly made
My son lies here and only of him, am I afraid
As I gaze into that face, I perceive that which is true
I created him and we created you in his image

(We would die for you, kill for you, welcome)
And I never knew love like this

To all new arrivals, we love you
We would die for you, kill for you, welcome
To all new arrivals, we love you
We would die for you, kill for you, welcome
Welcome, welcome
