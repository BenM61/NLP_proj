Vanished 
before your eyes 
and he took all 
your dreams alive 
Last stops and all night rides 
to that place 
where all the lonely hide... 

Stop running your heart around 
don't let it all get you down... 
Don't you know it's so easy--it's so easy 
if you're lookin' for a place to run 
well, I'm waiting--I'm waiting 
I'm waiting to be the one... 

I ain't no winner-- 
I'm no 'miracle-come-true' 
but I've waited so long now, baby-- 
for someone like you... 

Someone like you, like you, like you-- 
--all my life, oh, it's true now, baby... 

Wanting 
what you can't have 
Praying 
for what you need 
And when you cry out in the night 
not knowing what to do 
Who's the one--that 
shows up to pull you through?
