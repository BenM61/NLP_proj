I want to go ahead until I just run out of gas
I want to beat the road, with four-wheel thunder
There's a Cadillac dealer in Kansas City counting money
And the highway patrol are going nowhere
Don't say no, don't make me grieve
Don't say no, you gotta feel the breeze
On a clear night, moonlight
You and me and the car
Under a thousands stars
That's all the magic we need

So, don't you go turnin' my dream into a nightmare
see'mon, let's ride right out of here
I magine you and I, leavin' it all behind
Find another world, beyond the turnpike
There'll be lots of people uptight
Maybe some F.B.I., and your daddy screamin' bloody murder
Don't say no, don't make me grieve
Don't say no, you gotta feel the breeze
Picture the two of us, we're so happy, so much in love
You know how the story goes
At the end of the rainbow
There's a bag of gold
