Damn I want my baby back
It's so cold without her
Cold without her
She's gone
Now I'm alone, no one to hold on
Cause she was the only one
And I know I was dead wrong
But if you you
If you
See her soon
Ask her will she forgive me

If you ever see her
If you ever meet her
If you ever get a chance to sit down, talk to her
Let her know it's so cold
It's so cold, it's so cold
Here without her
And tell her I miss her
Tell her I need her
Tell her I want her
I really want her to come back home, back to keep me warm
Tell her I'm sorry, I'm really sorry
Can you forgive me?
Please forgive me
And come back home, keep me safe and warm

Now my baby's really gone
I don't know if she's coming home
My luck's up, I fucked up
I know
Tell me what to do to get her back
Back where her heart belongs, been gone from me too long

So if you, seen my boo
Please can you
Can you tell her for me

If you ever see her
If you ever meet her
If you ever get a chance to sit down and talk to her
Let her know it's so cold
It's so cold, it's so cold
Here without her
And tell her I miss her
Tell her I need her
Tell her I want her
I really want her to come back home, back to keep me warm
Tell her I'm sorry, I'm really sorry
Can you forgive me?
Please forgive me
And come back home, keep me safe and warm

All them girls across the world
You know you gotta be my girl
If you ever see her
If you ever meet her
If you ever get a chance to sit down and talk to her
Let her know it's so cold
It's so cold, it's so cold
Without her
