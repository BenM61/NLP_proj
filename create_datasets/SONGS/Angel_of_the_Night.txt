I have heard there's an angel
There's an angel of the night
Far thru time she has traveled
And she's watchin' out of sight

She knows, let her guide you
Listen if you can, you know she's wise
And she'll find you
Try to understand
In your heart she'll be hiding
For she's with you constantly
And somewhere from the darkness
She will slip into your dreams

You will know by the stillness
In the air you'll feel she's near
And if you will it
Maybe she'll appear

She's an angel
She's an angel of the night
She's an angel
She's a guardian of love

She's an angel
She's an angel of the night
She's an angel
She's a guardian of love
Love

When she speaks it's like music
Universal melodies
Lullabies that will soothe you
Put your life in harmony

She knows, let her guide you
Listen if you can, you know she's wise
If you understand

She's an angel
She's an angel of the night
She's an angel
She's a guardian of love
