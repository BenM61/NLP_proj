I can be so selfish, sad and moody
I can hear my mama talking to me
She said, 'Girl, you need to change your attitude'
I come home tired and I'm rude to you

And I've got a little problem with 'I'm sorry'
I say go to hell and in a hurry
And if that hurts, I get a little mad at you
The truth we know I'm a little jealous too

Well, if tears like rain have magic powers
Here they come again, them midnight showers

Let it rain tonight, purify like holy water
When I pray tonight, gonna say how much I want her
Start it again baby baby oh I wanna start again
And take it way back when

Do you remember those sweet talks early morning?
Looking and I turn into the dawning
If this works I'll thank the Lord with gratitude
I tell you I'd do all I got to do

But if tears like rain have magic powers
Here they come again, them midnight showers

Let it rain tonight, purify like holy water
Gonna pray tonight, gonna say how much I want her
Start it again, baby baby ooh I wanna start again
Take it way back when, well, well, yeah, yeah, come on

Let it rain, water wait I'm walkin'
Wash me up and wash me down
Gonna be good for me, oh let it rain
No more turning, no more tossing
Just like Christmas in the morning for you and me

Let it rain tonight, purify like holy water
When I pray tonight, gonna say how much I want her
Start it again
Take it way back when

Let it rain, tell water to wait I'm walkin'
Wash me up and wash me down, be good for me
Let it rain, no more turning and tossing
Just like Christmas in the morning for you and me

Let it rain tonight, purify like holy water
When I pray tonight
