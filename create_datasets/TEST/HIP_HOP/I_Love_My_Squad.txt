HBK yeah you know how we
And I can't quit all I know is
HBK yeah you know how we
And I can't quit all I know is

I love my gang
Wherever I go, my homies come too
I love my squad
We up in this thing, like what that shit do
I love my squad, I love my squad
I love my squad, I love my squad

Back up in this bitch, back up in this bitch
Make your lady back up in this bitch and hop up in the six
And you should know these rappers man, they say anything
I am a Suzy piggy bank, I got plenty change
She rep HBK the gang over everything
F*ck a bitch, I'm married to the game, with a wedding ring
Everybody try to duplicate, we just innovate
Young and making plenty cake, and my niggas straight
I'ma heart break vet, being broke what I can't accept
I'ma hold it down to the death
No Reebok's cause it's all about a check
Bet a million dollars that your man ain't like this
'Cause I stack my chips, I'm on my grind
Mind on money, money on my mind
So if you in the way I run you over
It's that heart break army I'ma soilder, uh

I love my gang
Wherever I go, my homies come too
I love my squad
We up in this thing, like what that shit do
I love my squad, I love my squad
I love my squad, I love my squad

Ain't nothing change but the name on the check
And that's real, that's real, that's real
And I don't know about yall but I'll die by respect
And that's real that's real that's real
I'ma live in the meantime
Haters telling me to chill cause they need time
I'ma dog, I'm just looking for some feline
Nice lips, big tits, big behind
Press rewind, told her bring back baby
Don't ever keep it PC with a Mac baby
Let me see what you'd do for a stack baby
I get it in, get it in, then I pass with her
Rest in peace it's the G A N G
Hate on me cause we ain't leave the seat vacant
We taking the R A P game to a new place
I swear that we got this shit tied like a shoe lace for real

I love my gang
Wherever I go, my homies come too
I love my squad
We up in this thing, like what that shit do
I love my squad, I love my squad
I love my squad, I love my squad

Wherever I go, my homies come too
We up in the this thing, like what that shit do
Wherever I go, my homies come too
We up in the this thing, like what that shit do
