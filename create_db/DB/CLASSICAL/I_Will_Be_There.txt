She is like the lady down the road
Or just the woman up the street
Like any mother you may know
To me, she is the one who had it planned
To lead us all to Wonderland
She always wanted us to go
And she said
"Don't ever be lonely
Remember, I'll always care
Wherever you may be
Remember I will be there"

And like another lady that we know
She has a smile so bright and sweet
And hair as white as driven snow
Though life is never easy day to day
She has a very special way
To make us smile when we are low

And she says
"Don't ever be lonely
Remember, I'll always care
Wherever you may be
Remember I will be there

Don't ever be lonely
Remember, I will be there

I will be there
I will be there
