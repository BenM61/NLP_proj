I will never be as cute as you
According to the board of human relations
I will never fly as high as you
According to the board of public citations

These are just the rules and regulations
Of the birds and the bees
The earth and the trees
Not to mention the gods, not to mention the gods

All my little life I've wanted to roam
Even if it was just inside my own home
Then one little day I chanced to look back
Saw you sittin' there being a sad culprit

These are just the rules and regulations
Of the birds and the bees
The earth and the trees
Not to mention the gods, not to mention the gods

These are just the rules and regulations
Yeah, these are just the rules and regulations
And I, like every one; yes I, like every one
Must follow them
