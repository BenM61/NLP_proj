If looks could kill then I know she would
She's playing the part, you know it's understood
I know the second glance was my first mistake
I took the chance that I had to take
Fire in her eyes made my blood run cold
She took me by surprise and I'm 

Spellbound, dreaming of you all the time
Spellbound, feels like I'm falling over the line
Spellbound, will my head be clear by the morning light 

I don't make promises that I can't keep
But I better think it over, I'm in way too deep
I'm shook up, paralyzed by her icy stare, long legs and golden hair
Late night love is on my mind
She took me by surprise and I'm 

Spellbound, dreaming of you all the time
Spellbound, feels like I'm falling over the line
Spellbound, will my head be clear by the morning light 

I'm on a one way ride to where I just don't know
She put a spell on me, the fantasy comes and goes 

I clear my head in the morning light
Start all over when I feel alright
I've gotta shape up before it's too late
I think I'm losin' my mind and I'm 

Spellbound, dreaming of you all the time
Spellbound, feels like I'm falling over the line
Spellbound, will my head be clear by the morning light 

Spellbound, can't find a reason, can't find a rhyme
Spellbound, give me a signal, show me a sign
Spellbound, will my head be clear in the morning light
