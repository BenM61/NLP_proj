I know the name
Of a lonely place
It's called: la vista de luna
When you're a part
Of the island-life
You feel so warm inside

uh, heaven's child
Uh, here's what you find

give me another
Just another sign of love
And I say: la vista de luna
Love is a brother
Under cover of the moon
I'll show you
It's really in my mind
When your part is done
Even love could fade away
If you got to leave
Just leave me on
La vista de luna

it's not the face
Of the moon tonight
It's just la vista de luna
And if you promise
To hold me tight
I feel so warm inside

uh, all my life
Uh, I'll stay by your side

give me another
Just another sign of love
And I say: la vista de luna
Love is a brother
Under cover of the moon
I'll show you
It's really in my mind
When your part is done
Even love could fade away
If you got to leave
Just leave me on
La vista de luna
