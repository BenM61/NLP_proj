(daryl hall)

I like to read and I like to write
But you could persuade me to put the book down tonight
Just please don't ask to be a song heroine
It's not that easy just to stick you in, stick you in
Oh babe, I know you're right
But there's no time and it's not the night
I'd have to face you again and again
Although you know I'd like to stick you in, stick you in

They're all sacred songs
They're not easily won
You know the words just seem to live on
The thoughts are sacred
Though the sound is profane
But this and that you know they're
One and the same
One and the same
One and the one and the same

You never know how you're gonna end
I start out hard and I end up thin
You waste your time but you occasionally score
But you can't tell from what went down before, down before
Oh babe, do you see my point?
There's just no time and it's not the night
I'd have to face you again and again
Although you know I'd like to stick it in, stick it in

They're all sacred songs
They're not easily won
You know the words just seem to live on
The thoughts are sacred
Though the sound is profane
But this and that you know they're
One and the same
One and the same
One and the one and the same
