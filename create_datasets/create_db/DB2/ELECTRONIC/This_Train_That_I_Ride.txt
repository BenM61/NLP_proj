This train that I ride
I am walkin' down this track
With tears in my eyes
Tryin' to read a letter from my home

If this train run me right
I'll be home tonight, 500 miles from my home
I hate that lonesome whistle song
That long train whistlin' down

I am walkin' down this track
With tears in my eyes
Tryin' to read a letter
From my home

This train that I ride
A hundred coaches long
Hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
I'm one, Lord, I'm two

I hate that lonesome whistle song
That long train whistlin' down

This train that I ride
A hundred coaches long
Hear the whistle blow
This train that I ride

If I pawn you, my wagon, pawn you, my teeth
If I pawn you, my watch and chain
If this train run me right
I'll be home tonight, 500 miles

This train that I ride

If you miss the train I'm on
You will know that I am gone, 500 miles
I'm one, lord, I'm two
Three, lord, I'm four

I hate that lonesome whistle song
That long train whistlin' down
If you miss the train I'm on
You will know that I am gone, 500 miles

This train that I ride
If you miss the train I'm on
