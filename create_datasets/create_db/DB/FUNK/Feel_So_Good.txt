Feels good
I'm stranded on a spaceship hideaway
And something makes me think I'm here to stay
I'm so happy where I am

Feels good
I've journeyed to the other atmosphere
And every breath I take just makes it clear
I'm holding heaven in my hands
It's automatic baby and it feels so good

Feels good
These extra-sensory sensations
Are causing me some complications
Electrostatic information

Feels good
I'm playing with a pleasure trafficker
Arriving soon intergalactica
I'm holding heaven in my hands
It's automatic baby and it feels good

Feels good
Feels so good
