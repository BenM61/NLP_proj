It's another one of them ol' funky Cypress Hill things
You know what I'm sayin?
And it goes like this

Hey don't miss out on what you're passing
You're missing the hoota of the funky Buddha
Eluder or the fucked up styles to get wicked
So come on as cypress starts to kick it
'Cause we're like the outlaw stridin' while suckers are hidin'
Jump behind the bush when they see me driving
By, hangin' out the window
And my Magnum takin' out some puto's
Acting kinda loco, I'm just another local
Kid from from the street getting paid for my vocals

Here is something you can't understand 
(How I could just kill a man)
Here is something you can't understand 
(How I could just kill a man)
Here is something you can't understand 
(How I could just kill a man)
Here is something you can't understand 
(How I could just kill a man)
Here is something you can't understand 

I'm ignoring all the dumb shit
Yo, because nothin' is comin' from it
I'm not gonna waste no time
Fuckin' around my gat straight hummin'
Hummin' comin' at cha
And you know I had to gat ya

Time for some action, just a fraction of friction
I got the clearance to run the interference
Into your satellite, shining a battle light
Swing out the gat, and I know that will gat ya right
Here's an example, just a little sample
How I could just kill a man!
One-time tried to come in my home
Take my chrome, I said "Yo, it's on
Take cover son, or you're ass-out
How you like my chrome?", then I watched the rookie pass out
Didn't have to blast out, but I did anyway
Young punk had to pay
So I just killed a man!

Here is something you can't understand 
(How I could just kill a man)
Here is something you can't understand 
(How I could just kill a man)
Here is something you can't understand 
(How I could just kill a man)
Here is something you can't understand 
(How I could just kill a man)

It's gonna be a long time before I finish
One of the many missions that I have to establish
To light my spliff, ignite ya with insights
And if you ain't down, bullshit!
Say some punk try to get you for your auto
Would you call the one-time, play the role model?
No, I think you play like a thug
Next hear the shot of a Magnum slug
Hummin', comin' at cha
Yeah ya know I'm gonna gat ya
How do you know where I'm at when you haven't been where I've been
Understand where I'm coming from
When you're up on the hill, in your big home
I'm out here, risking my dome
Just for a bucket, or a fast ducat
Just to stay alive, aiyyo I gotta say "f*ck it"

Here is something you can't understand 
(How I could just kill a man)
Here is something you can't understand 
(How I could just kill a man)
Here is something you can't understand 
(How I could just kill a man)
Here is something you can't understand 
(How I could just kill a man)
Here is something you can't understand
