Shooting star across the desert sky
The sun is bleeding into my eye
I can't help but notice the way you talk
When darkness falls there will be war

I'm bleeding, I'm bleeding from within
I'm bleeding, you're bleeding from within
I'm bleeding, I'm bleeding from within
I'm bleeding

Just happened to be
The most precious night
That I have ever lived
And they're still fighting

I'm bleeding, I'm bleeding from within
I'm bleeding, you're bleeding from within
I'm bleeding, I'm bleeding from within
I'm bleeding

Burn burn burn burn
Burn burn burn burn
Burn burn burn burn
Burn burn burn burn

I said I'd like to know what I'm fighting for
I've have no reason to die
I said I'd like to know what I'm fighting for
Before I die
You give them a gun, and tell them to take alive
I said I'm not willing to do that, baby
I'm not willing to do that, baby

I'm bleeding, I'm bleeding from within
I'm bleeding, you're bleeding from within
I'm bleeding, I'm bleeding from within
I'm bleeding

Burn burn burn burn
Burn burn burn burn
Burn burn burn burn
Burn burn burn burn

Burn burn burn burn
Burn burn burn burn
When darkness falls
Burn burn burn burn

Burn burn burn burn
Burn burn burn burn
Burn burn burn burn
Burn burn burn burn
Burn burn burn burn
Burn burn burn burn
