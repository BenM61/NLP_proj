What you do
Raise the roof
Everybody
Wants you to

And you do it with
And you do it with 
And you do it with 

And you do it with, love

When you do
That thing you do
Love comes through
You raise the roof

Put the music on 
Put the music on 
Put the music on 

They all wanna dance

Can do anything
If you dare
Don't mean a thing
Unless you care

And you do it with
And you do it with 
And you do it with 

And you do it with, love

All those years I wasted
Sitting on my own
Think what I could have tasted
If I'd only known

Why did I wait
Why did I wait

Don't tell me it's too late

Why did I wait

Don't tell me it's too late

So open up
Before you start
Open hand
Open heart

Bring it on 
Bring it on 

Bring it on, home 
Bring it on, home 

Why did I wait
Why did I wait

Don't tell me it's too late 
Don't tell me it's too late
Don't tell me it's too late
Don't tell me it's too late
Don't tell me it's too late
