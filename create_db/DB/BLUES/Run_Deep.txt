And my eyes are wide this morning
But my heart is heavy still
There's a sea inside me
Storming, 'cause I'm battling with my will
Though I may grow tired and weary
And ache within my bones
I will fight for what I believe in, even if I fight alone
I know that I'm gon' keep on moving on
'Cause nobody can stop me, yeah

'Cause I gather my armour
And I'm ready for battle
I got my weapons drawn
Taking the road less traveled
And I'm ready to do this
And nobody can stop me
'Cause I'm thoroughly convinced
This is my love and it runs deep

And my whole life
There have been many who have tried to bring me down
But I know in my soul
Oh that I am upward bound
Doesn't matter what they think of me
'Cause I know what I was born to be
I Don't do it, 'cause it's trendy
I hold on to my integrity
Manifest my own reality
And soon all them haters will see
That nobody can stop me yeah

'Cause I gather my armour
And I'm ready for battle
I got my weapons drawn
Taking the road less traveled
And I'm ready to do this
And nobody can stop me
'Cause I'm thoroughly convinced
This is my love and it runs deep

And the skinny ass black girl back in the class
Damn try than think I could pass
Then I fight 'cause I had already lost more than a shell 
Of battles seafront why had, therefore she just let 
Me try to break me wreck me, give up, listen
Now they're playing super sonic
They don't feel intimidated give up on my dreams and goes for their to be accommodated
Let them use my mind and body making that shit looks saucing
That's because they used my gifts 'cause they might call me bitch and boss me
Now I opened my soul with them down, and fo'
Exactly what they love when I crown me, fo'
What I hold they can't touch
What I had they can't buy
When I told the folks they doubt it couple times I'm buried in that lie
Ya I lost some battles, but I win the war
Here to stand and estimated, I'll settle the score
Trendy like the blood in my vain, to give me fever
And I still running till you divide

And I gather my armour
And I'm ready for battle
I got my weapons drawn
Taking the road less traveled
And I'm ready to do this
And nobody can stop me (can't stop, won't stop)
'Cause I'm thoroughly convinced
This is my love and it runs deep

Go girl, the queen
This is my love and it runs deep
This is my love and it runs deep
(This is my love, this is my love)
This is my love and it runs deep
This is my love
This is my love and it runs deep
