With beady black eyes, the bluebird has died
It's feathers have dried, it couldn't survive
From the winter's grasp, nothing ever lasts
But you and I know, the seasons are slow
The rivers they froze, the wind always blows
Down all our dreams, the engine's out of steam

All of your days will be blessed
So put on a smile and get dressed
Into the void we will fly away from here
All of your thoughts will be crowned
You'll be the toast of town
Into the view of a million crystal spheres

Pitchfork in my foot, I tried the best I could
Dragging all this wood, with a rusty old fishhook
To feed the fire and make our blood flow higher
But I'm a stubborn man, the sun needs my command
I'm gonna make a stand, condemnd this twisted land
I'm sure you'd agree, but I can't leave you see

All of your days will be blessed
So put on a smile and get dressed
Into the void we will fly away from here
All of your thoughts will be crowned
You'll be the toast of town
Into the view of a million crystal spheres

All of your days will be blessed
So put on a smile and get dressed
Into the void we will fly away from here
All of your thoughts will be crowned
You'll be the toast of town
Into the view of a million crystal spheres

But you and I know, the seasons are slow
The rivers they froze, the wind always blows
Down all our dreams, the engine's out of steam
