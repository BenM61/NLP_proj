It's dark, it is cold
So lay low 'cause there's blood on the floor
At the door lay your bones
And you feel all the blood in your clothes

You can hear me, you come kneeling
With the fear they invoke to control it
So you're burning with the feeling
Let the blood rush your head as they're calling, they're calling

So unwind and dip into the rage you conceal
And embrace your despair that you feel
But you can't so you're burning over, over, over
Yeah

Come with us and feel the bloodlust
Within just one touch, you'll feel the bloodlust
Come with us and feel the bloodlust
Within just one touch, you'll feel the bloodlust

You're back in the flesh 
And you seem to have thirst for the crime
Shivers down your spine
Don't look lost; you can't see, must be blind
'Cause these voices keep on calling
But not changed now - I'm not listening and fading but falling

So unwind and dip into the rage you conceal
And embrace your despair that you feel
But you can't so you're burning over, over, over
Yeah

Come with us and feel the bloodlust
Within just one touch, you'll feel the bloodlust
Come with us and feel the bloodlust
Within just one touch, you'll feel the bloodlust
