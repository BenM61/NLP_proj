My Museum

Romantic dreams of youth,
all the color and the light dazzled my eyes.
Love looked so promising from far away.
A world of hopes and possibilities of what life could be,
and every night and day I'd dream
of all I'd have in my museum.

Through landscapes blue and gold,
in the shadows and sunlight I searched for truth,
but my elusive muse seemed lost at sea.
And all I found were statues made of stone, lifelike, but so cold.
Their jaded hearts and marble souls
left empty halls in my museum. 

But still I wished for one work of art
I could treasure and hold.
Monet in spring, in twilight's dim
I'd dance for my Degas, could be Caravaggio,
or my Picasso. 

At last it's come to light. 
Now this rare and priceless gem defines my life,
and every corridor leads to this room.
A perfect place where light is never lost and time can't exist,
a single painting hangs just so,
my masterpiece in my museum;
a portrait of you.
