The buttons on your collar
The color of your hair
I think I see you everywhere

I want to live forever
And watch you dancing in the air

All the lies and make believe
The very things that one day leave
But I can see you standing in mid air

The girl I want to marry
Upon the high trapeze
The day she fell and hurt her knees

And only time can make you
The wind that blows away the leaves

For everything that life was worth
The fallen snow, the virgin birth
Yeah I can see her standing in mid air
I can see you standing in mid air.
