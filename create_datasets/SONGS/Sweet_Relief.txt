What have I got to do?
Gotta get through to you
You know I want skin to skin
So gimme that sweet relief
What have I got to say?
What game have I got to play?
Don't need love to live
Just gimme that sweet release

Ooh!

Gonna need to relax, take a load off your back
Loosen up your mind
You don't have to drive, feel it up in your spine
We can wait for the ooh!

Cool! Rush!
Come on we're touching that adventure
Too! Much!
Tell me to stop, just wanna touch somebody
Good boys
Drinkin' me good to take the edge off
Hot! Flash!
Feels so good when you give me that sweet relief

You only feel good to be
Right up close to me
Let your mind run so free
Give into the sweet relief, ooh!
Ninety-five on your back
Liquor ain't cuttin' it
Slow down underneath the speed
Just give into the sweet release, oh!

Yeah, baby they're askin' to re-attach
And tonight we're gonna lead
Believe in the wounds, so do what you do
Wait for the, ooh!

Cool! Rush!
Come on we're touching that adventure
Too! Much!
Tell me to stop, just wanna touch somebody
Good boys
Drinkin' me good to take the edge off
Hot! Flash!
Feels so good when you give me that sweet relief

Ooh, ah!
Touchin' my body, oh!
Oh, oh, ah!
Touchin' my body!
Oh, babe! My!
Touchin' my body!
Oh! Ah!
Touchin' my body!
