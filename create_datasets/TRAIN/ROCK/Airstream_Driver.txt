All the angels on the wire
Getting dizzy from the heights
Go carefully, carefully
Oh, airstream driver

She shoots but never misses
Stare down passin' traffic
Go carefully, carefully
Oh, airstream driver

I would return the favor
Oversleep the rapture
Go carefully, carefully
Oh, airstream driver

Your watermelon candy mouth
The penthouse at the sands
Go carefully, carefully
Oh, airstream driver

All the angels on the wire
Getting dizzy from the heights
Go carefully, carefully
Oh, airstream driver

She shoots but never misses
Stare down passin' traffic
Go carefully, carefully
Oh, airstream driver

I would return the favor
Oversleep the rapture
Go carefully, carefully
Oh, airstream driver

Your watermelon candy mouth
The penthouse at the sands
Go carefully, carefully
Oh, airstream driver

Go go go go carefully, go airstream driver
Go go go go carefully, go airstream driver
Go go go go carefully, go airstream driver
Go go go go carefully, go airstream driver
Go go go go carefully, go airstream driver
