Hey hey uh huh huh huh huh oh 
Uh huh huh huh huh huh yeah 
It's twenty five miles from home girl
My feet are hurting mighty bad 
Now I've been walking a three day, two lonely nights 
You know that I'm mighty mad 
But I got a woman waiting for me 
That's gonna make this trip worthwhile 
You see she's got the kind of lovin' and a kissing 
A make a man go stone wild 
So I got to keep on walkin' 
I got to walk on, oh ho ho 
I, I, I, I'm so tired 
But I just can't lose my stride 

I got fifteen miles to go now 
And I can hear my baby calling my name 
It's as if as though I'm standing at her front door 
I can hear that doggone plain 
Now I'll be so glad to see my baby 
And hold her in my arms one more time
Now when I kiss her lips 
I turn a back over flip and I'll forget these feet of mine 
I got to keep on walkin' 
I got to walk on oh ho ho 
I, I, I, I, I'm so tired but I just can't lose my stride 
Come on feet don't fail me now 
I got ten more miles to go 
I got nine, eight, seven, six
I got a five more miles to go 
Now over the hill just around the bend 
Huh although my feet are tired I can't lose my stride 
I got to get to my baby again

I got to keep on walkin' 
I got to walk on 
I, I, I, I, I'm so tired but I just can't lose my stride, yeah
I got to walk on, let me tell you y'all
I see my baby just across the fence
