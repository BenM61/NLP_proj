Her day was born in shades of blue
Her song was sad the words were true
Her morning came too fast too soon
And died before the afternoon

Poor lady day could use some love, some sunshine
Lady day has too much rain
Poor lady day could use some spring, some breezes
Lady day has too much pain

It's such a lonely face
It's such a cloudy sky
So many shadows in her eye
So many empty dreams
So many bitter times
Just a handful
Of broken rhymes

Poor lady day could use a smile, some kindness
Lady day has too much rain
Poor lady day could use some dreams, some flowers
Lady day has too much pain

Just too much to say
Just to much to know
Too little time to say hello
And then the evening comes
And now she doesn't cry
And it's too late to say
Good-bye
