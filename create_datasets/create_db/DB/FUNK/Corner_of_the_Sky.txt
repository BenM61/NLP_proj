Everything has its season 
Everything has its time
Show me a reason
And I'll soon show you a rhyme

Cats sit on the window sill
Children sit in the show
Why do I feel I don't fit in
Anywhere I go

Rivers belong where they can ramble
Eagles belong where they can fly
I've got to be where my spirit can run free
Gotta find my corner, of the sky

Every man his daydreams 
Every man has his goal
People like the way dreams have of 
Sticking to the soul

Rain comes after thunder
Winter comes after fall
Sometimes I think I'm not after
Anything at all

So many men seem destined
To settle for something small
But I, I won't rest
'Til I know I have it all
So don't ask where I'm going
Just listen when I'm gone
Far away you'll hear me singing
Softly to the dawn

Oh, rivers belong where they can ramble, 
Oh, eagles belong where they can fly
I've got to be where my spirit can run free, yeah
Gotta find my corner, ooh of the sky, yeah (of the sky, yeah)
Rivers belong where they can ramble
Oh, eagles belong where they can fly (high)
Oh, I've got to be where my spirit can run free
Gotta find my corner
Gotta find my corner, yes I do
Gotta find my corner
Gotta find my corner of the sky, sky
Gotta find my corner of the sky, sky
