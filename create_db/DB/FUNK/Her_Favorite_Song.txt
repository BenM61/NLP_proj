Friday night at the scene is bright at Avalon
Walked straight to the bar in her party dress, yes
Told the bartender pour her a shot
And make it strong
Because she needed cheering up
She proceeded to get drunk
You could see it tearing up in her eyes

But when she gets home, she puts her headphones on
She plays her favorite song and fades away
And when the musics on she can do no wrong
And she feels safe and calm and it's okay
And she says, ba ba dum ba dee ah dum ba
Ba ba dum ba dee ah dum ba
The world keeps turning, life goes on
Yeah she says, ba ba dum ba dee ah dum ba
Ba ba dum ba dee ah dum ba
The world keeps turning, life goes on

Night before had a date with a boy from Highland Park
Said he'd meet her at the diner at nine o'clock
Leather boots, eyeliner laid on extra dark
She got a table set for two
But he never made it through
And she tried to play it cool, as she cried

But when she gets home, she puts her headphones on
She plays her favorite song and fades away
And when the musics on she can do no wrong
And she feels safe and calm and it's okay
And she says, ba ba dum ba dee ah dum ba
Ba ba dum ba dee ah dum ba
The world keeps turning, life goes on
Yeah she says, ba ba dum ba dee ah dum ba
Ba ba dum ba dee ah dum ba
The world keeps turning, life goes on

You got to shake it off, shake it
You got to shake it off, shake it
You got to shake it off, shake it
You got to shake it off
Got to shake it off, shake it
Got to shake it off, shake it
Got to shake it off, shake it
