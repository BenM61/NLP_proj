I had to look inside this fragile heart of mine,
To find exactly what it was you saw,
I had to put myself back in the firing line,
To take the shot that knocked me to the floor.

I was down, losing faith,
Oh I was lost in the crowd,
You brought me 'round.

How did you find me?
You came out of nowhere like lightening,
It's kind of amazing how you found me,
Through all the noise somehow.

I was pulling empty pales out of the wishing well,
Only holy water breaks the spell,
I had to pinch myself, 'cause I knew all too well,
The stairway to heaven always starts in hell.

I was down,
But somehow an angel heard my sound,
And brought me 'round.

How did you find me?
You came out of nowhere like lightening,
It's kind of amazing how you found me,
Through all the noise somehow.
Oh, and how did you see me?
Broke through the darkness,
And you reached me,
It's kind of amazing how you found me,
Through all the strangers somehow.

Faith and little patience for this heart of mine,
Though I would stay here waiting 'til the end of time.

How did you find me?
You came out of nowhere like lightening,
It's kind of amazing how you found me,
Through all the noise somehow.
Oh, how did you see me?
Broke through the darkness,
And you reached me,
It's kind of amazing how you found me,
Through all the strangers somehow,
Through all the strangers somehow, oh, somehow.
