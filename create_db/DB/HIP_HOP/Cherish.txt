Cherish is the word
I use to describe
All the feelings that I have
Hiding here for you inside
Hey-hey-hey-hey
You don't know how many times I wish that I had told you
You don't know how many times I wish that I had held you, yeah
You don't know how many times I wish I could mold you into someone

Cherish me as much as I
(Who could cherish me)
As much as I
Cherish you
As much as I cherish you

Cherish is the word
That more than applies
Ooh, oh
There's a hole in my heart
Each time I realize, yeah
That I am not gonna be the one to share your dreams
That I am not gonna be the one to share your schemes
I am not gonna be the one share

Cherish me as much as I
Every night and day with you baby
Cherish you

Oooh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh
Cherish, Cherish, Cherish, Cherish, Cherish, Cherish
Cherish, Cherish, Cherish, Cherish, Cherish, Cherish
Cherish, Cherish, Cherish, Cherish, Cherish
You don't know how many times I wish I had told ya
You don't know how many times I wish I had held you
You don't know how many times
I wish I could mold you into someone

Cherish me as much as I
Cherish you
Cherish me as much as I cherish you
