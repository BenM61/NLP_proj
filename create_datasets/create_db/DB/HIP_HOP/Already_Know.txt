Traffic at a standstill
Traffic backed up in the chi-town
Interstate 55 me and my guys
Touchdown from the...
Probably goin' hook up and do a couple songs
Bout pimpin' ass playa
Partners from the rap-a-lot down to do or die
Then I spotted baby girl she was fly
Starin' me down up out the corner of her eye
...might as well give it a try.
Showin' bad spots kinda sorta remind me of baby girl from soul food
Vivica fox, I'm in a mimigets strech limosine
She in a porce boxter lookin' hella clean
I rolled the tinted window crack down halfway
She asked me where I'm from I said the "yay"
Area baby where we crazy baby
No if, and, buts, or questions baby

[ak-47]
Emosh know playboy I can mingle with the coldest hoes

Thinkin like walfare cheap got her hair tuck deep
Uh huh but you already know
Got the bomb on the head
But you already know
Tell her somethin' good she redts to go
All off in my shit when I test the po
Rubbin on the caddy fo we hit the mo mo
So why yo homies all on dummy

Now I gotta have em' locked like loote
Thrownin that ass in them skin tight suits
Fly around the world, but they passed mangruit
Show the club love put the money in the juice
I don't have to flash my money got proof

A whole new game

Rollin' the dice but with a head full of craps
Rollin like us' got needs ever have

Flex for a mil till my hand touch a bill

That means somebody get the raw deal
See you blowin me and um

And I uh, really don't want the body

Continue to spit these lugz up out my litical glock
Continue to spit these hot ones up out my chopper
Continue to always love chequre to pop

So I guess that's why I can continue to poison these felines
Mas de gas continue the tycoon status
To response, the saschwach pimp the trees on
