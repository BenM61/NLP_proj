Baby it's real... 
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah now hit it 
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah now hit it (ohh) 
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah now hit it 
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah now hit it 

Innocence is what I've got 
It'll take true love to hit the spot 
Can't control my every move 
When we're together we're in the groove 

Don't care about your other girls 
I'm the only one that rocks your world 
Gonna hafta keep me satisfied 
'Cause my innocence won't be denied 
No 

Baby it's real (baby baby) 
So so real (baby baby) 
That I just can't explain the way that it's making me feel 
So so real 
Baby it's real (i just can't let you go) 
Baby oh baby it's real (keeps me hanging on) 
Baby it's real 

My heart is under lock and key 
Together we can set it free 
Ain't no mountain that we can't climb 
All you gotta do is take your time 

Said I'm giving you my all and all 
Be careful you don't slip and fall 
It's my innocence that makes you yearn 
For that perfect gift you can't return 
No 

Baby it's real (baby baby) 
So so real (baby baby) 
That I just can't explain the way that it's making me feel 
So so real 
Baby it's real (i just can't let you go) 
Baby oh baby it's real (keeps me hanging on) 
Baby it's real 

Baby you know that it's real 
The way you're making me feel 
You know that baby, baby, baby it's real 
Ohh that I just can't explain the way that it's making me feel 
Baby baby (you know it's making me feel) 
So so real (so so real) 

Baby it's real (baby baby) 
So so real (baby baby) 
That I just can't explain the way that it's making me feel 
So so real 
Baby it's real (i just can't let you go) 
Baby oh baby it's real (keeps me hanging on) 
Baby it's real 

Baby it's real (baby baby) 
So so real (baby baby) 
That I just can't explain the way that it's making me feel 
So so real 
Baby it's real (i just can't let you go) 
Baby oh baby it's real (keeps me hanging on) 
Baby it's real
