When am with you girl
I'm down with anything
I like the things that we do 
If you know what I mean

The way you turn me on
To the early morn
(Ooh I like it when your makin' me hot)
When we're all alone
We can make it right
Its like that everyday and every night
You touched my heart my body and soul
(I like it when I can't get enough)
Ill be, everything that you want me to be
Ill do, everything that you want me to do
Ill say everything that you want me to say

I wanna love you like this
I wanna love you like that
I wanna be your everything tonight 
I wanna love you like mad

I wanna love you like this
I wanna love you like that
I wanna be your everything tonight 
I wanna love you like mad

When I'm with you boy
I'm down with anything
I like the things that we do 
If you know what I mean

The way you turn me on
To the break of dawn
(I like the way your making me hot hot)

When we're all alone
We can make it right
Its like that everyday and every night
You touched my heart my body and soul
(I love you and I won't let you go c'mon)

Ill be, everything that you want me to be
Ill do, everything that you want me to do
Ill say everything that you want me to say

I wanna love you like this
I wanna love you like that
I wanna be your everything tonight 
I wanna love you like mad

I wanna love you like this
I wanna love you like that
I wanna be your everything tonight 
I wanna love you like mad

Drop da ice spread it all across ya face
Take out da syrup spread all across ya spine
I hope you don't mind bout I'm about to take my time
Like champagne wine expensive and defined

The way your skin feels when its up against mine
Its something heaven sent ooo boy you feel devine
One touch boy your making me quiver
Sweat is dripping down your face can't wait till you deliver

I wanna love you like this
I wanna love you like that
I wanna be your everything tonight 
I wanna love you like mad

I wanna love you like this
I wanna love you like that
I wanna be your everything tonight 
I wanna love you like mad

Baby it's the way I feel
You're the one for me
Baby it's the way I feel

Baby it's the way I feel
You're the one for me
Baby it's the way I feel
Nah nah nah
