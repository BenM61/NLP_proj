I can't believe she bought it
She got too close and she caught it
Had a point but she forgot it
When you skip steps on the way up
The gaps have a way of catching up
And you can't cover that with makeup

Your gonna fall behind me
Your gonna cry and beg for mercy
'Cause your not ready baby
And you got nothing on me 
And you got nothing on me)

Now that I'm getting to know her
Part of me wants to show her
Who she's really screwing over
Cause she's got nothing real
Taking everything she can steal
Just like it was her last meal

Your gonna fall behind me
Your gonna cry and beg for mercy
'Cause your not ready baby
And you got nothing on me

Your gonna fall behind me
Your gonna cry and beg for mercy
'Cause your not ready baby
And you got nothing on me

How long is she gonna be around
And how long do we have to watch her dumb it down
'Cause when its cheap it fades fast
And how long does she think it's gonna last?

Your gonna fall behind me
Your gonna cry and beg for mercy
'Cause your not ready baby
And you got nothing on me

Your gonna fall behind me
Your gonna cry and beg for mercy
'Cause your not ready baby

And you got nothing on me
And you got nothing on me
And you got nothing on me
And you got nothing on me
