Show me where you want that love
'Cause you can't do me wrong
Tell me where you feel that love
'Cause I wanna take you home
Tell me where you feel that love
Can't leave where you are not
How we gonna do the love?
I want to know it before

Biting deep into my shoulder
Let me you know you're there
Moving up a little closer
Let me know you care
Gonna last a whole of a long time
The love, the love we share

The love
How we do
The love

Show me where you 
Want the love
How we gonna do
The love?

Show me where you want that love
'Cause you can't do me wrong
