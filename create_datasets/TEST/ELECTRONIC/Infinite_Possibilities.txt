21 
Oh life has just begun 
Got a temper like a gun 
Pointing it at everyone 
That's his game 
And it helps him to get through the day 
But a voice inside him says 
How much longer can I play 

He's got infinite possibilities 
I can see them now 
It's the unbroken chains of his past by which he's bound 
He's got infinite possibilities 
I can feel them now 
If he chooses well, then nothing can tear him down 

Peace of mind 
Is not easy for him to find 
And he's walkin' a thinner line 
In a place where another man is keeping his time 
Though he's young 
He's not like everyone
He sees what he's become 
And he'd rather be standing in the sun 

He's got infinite possibilities 
I can see them now 
It's the unbroken chains of his past by which he's bound 
He's got infinite possibilities 
I can feel them now 
If he chooses well, then nothing can tear him down 

He's got infinite possibilities 
I can see them now 
It's the unbroken chains of his past by which he's bound 
He's got infinite possibilities 
I can feel them now 
If he chooses well, then nothing can tear him down 

With infinite possibilities 
Infinite...possibilities 
Stand in the sun and see
