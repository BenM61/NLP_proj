They made niggas, we sprayed niggas
They got smart, gave us aids nigga
They killed kings, you a brave nigga
You god to, made nigga
Made to hate your dark skin
You god son, they satan
They killed natives, raped men
Then went to church hollering amen!
And gave us liquor, gave us coke
But blame niggas, for selling dope
Olie north, up in the whole hood
Snow white but it ain't soap
So whos to blame for this shady word
Say it how you want it, it's the same word
No matter what wings, it the same bird
From pyramids to dope serve
