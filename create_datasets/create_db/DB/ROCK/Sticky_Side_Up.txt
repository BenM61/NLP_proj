Standin' on the front line, a bullet in my head 
Run a bad luck highway mile, ridin' the rails naked and dead 
Sins of the flesh, seasons of the witch 
Ain't nobody gonna scratch my itch 
Spin another lie and tell me it's alright, yeah it's alright 
It's ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! 

Smooth side down, sticky side up 
Watch me drown in your lovin' cup 
Nail me to the floor, roll me in the rug 
Smooth side down, sticky sticky side up 

Scratchin' on the back door, ringin' in my ears 
Hang dog on a ball and chain, gettin' high on the Devil's tears 

Give me a shovel, I'll dig my own grave 
Rooster go pimpin' for some other slave 
The knife's in my back, smile and tell me it's alright, yeah it's alright 
It's ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! 

Smooth side down, sticky side up 
Watch me drown in your lovin' cup 
Nail me to the floor, roll me in the rug 
Smooth side down, sticky sticky side up 

Smooth side down, sticky side up 
Watch me drown in your lovin' cup 
Nail me to the floor, roll me in the rug 
Smooth side down, sticky sticky - sticky sticky side 

(Oh yeah) Smooth side down (oh smooth it up, baby, that's right) 

Smooth side down, sticky side up 
Watch me drown in your lovin' cup 
Nail me to the floor, roll me in the rug 
Smooth side down, sticky sticky side up 

Smooth side down, sticky sticky, sticky sticky, sticky sticky side up!
