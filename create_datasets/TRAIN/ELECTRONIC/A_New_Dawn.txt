Lightly come, lightly go
Sick of your idealized home
I'm only pain
Not good for you
Don't follow me for
I'm lost too

Another day, another way
Once again I brave the world
In the light of things to come
It takes more to turn me on

And when the day is dawning
I leave it all behind
And when your world is calling
I leave it all behind

With a crying eye

And when the day is dawning
I leave it all behind (with a crying eye)
And when your world is calling
I leave it all behind (with a crying eye)

And when the day is dawning
I leave it all behind
And everything you're falling for
I leave it all behind
