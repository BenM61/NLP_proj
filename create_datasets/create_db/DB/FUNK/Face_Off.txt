I'm sayin', I finally found the right girl for me
I'm sayin' you, you my nigga dog
So you ain't gotta worry bout Lil' Mama comin' between we dude
We still homies at the end of the day
Believe that

[Chorus]
No no no
I don't wanna know it
She got him where she want him
And he's too lost to know it (know it)
It's too late to tell him
He's caught in that position
Where he won't listen even if I yell it
Just tryin' help before he let that
River push off him into something deep
I wish he would think(uh huh)
I wish he would think(uh huh)
Or listen to me, 'cause

I got a love Jones but I'm not Lorenz Tate
How would it sound if I asked you "Wanna date?"
(How would that sound mama?)
I know a place me and you, girl, can get away
My niggas tryna talk to me forget what they say

She'll ride for a nigga, she a down ass chick
Run them other chicks to the exit quick
Let them niggas hate
They goin' hate but them niggas can't tell me shit

Let her meet my mama, she don't be with all the drama
Spend bread on my broad (cash)
'Cause she know it ain't a problem
I splurge on my lady, hit the mall with my lady

I love my lady, I know she would never play me
She be moaning, groaning making them sounds
Every time a nigga lay that pipe down
Give it to her how she want, when she want it

That grown man, I'm a
Yep that's my style
I finally found the right girl
Think I might wife her
My nigga don't like her

But girl I'm the type of
Dude that would do anything for his lady
Can I trust you? (yea)
That's my lady

[Chorus]

Now what am I gonna do
What am I gonna say
Been in this position before
Put my man up on game

Said I was tryin' hate
Now he ain't my nigga no more
I don't want the same thing to go down
Between me and bow, we gettin' this money man

There's gotta be a way to do this
'Cause my nigga's walkin' round clueless
Do I? Come right out and talk about it
Or do I just beat around the bush about it
Or should I Let Lil' Ronnie tell him for me
No I feel obligated, That's my homie

What would you do if you was me mane?
Tell him the truth or let it be mane?
I'm stuck 'tween a rock and a hard place
But I gotta stop my boy from gettin played

[Chorus]

Now Bow, I'm a tell you from experience
Man What's happening?
On the real, you needa go on and give it up
Yea whatever
You been lovin' her, trustin' her, kickin' up
Yea yea
But she's been playin ya, replacing ya, ya oh

Man look, ay look
She a real ass chick
A down ass chick
She got money, she ain't tryin' get rich quick

She ain't stuntin' other niggas
Man it's all about me
When I ask her who's it is
She replies "Bow Weezy"

She got a nigga and a baby
Cranberry Mercedes
Listen to your dog
Man yo girl is being shady
Got that from a very reliable source

O, who said that shit?

Very reliable source

Man look. 
Ay, Just be happy for your man
O, Damn Why you hatin'?
Why don't you go get you one?
What you mad cause we datin'?

Dog, it ain't like that. 
Bow, you know I got your back
I don't wanna see you get played by no hood rat

Bow Wow: Dog, she ain't no Hoodrat. 
Watch how you talk about her
When it come to lil' Mama. 
Man I get down for her

I know I shouldn't have told yo ass. 
You coming at me like that

[Chorus]
