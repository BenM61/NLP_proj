A choice is set before you now
Living or dying, blessing or cursing
You know, the time has come around
To turn from your fighting and rest in his mercy

Choose life, that you might live
The life that He gives, He gives you forever
Choose life, the way that it's true
From the One who chose you, your Father in heaven
Choose life

Trust the Lord with all your heart
All of your soul and all of your being
Hold on, listen and obey
Surrender your life into His keeping

Choose life, that you might live
The life that He gives, He gives you forever
Choose life, the way that it's true
From the One who chose you, your Father in heaven
Choose life

And the weight you're under
Will be lifted away and the world will wonder
What happened here today?
Then you'll stand right here and say

Choose life, that you might live
The life that He gives, He gives you forever
Choose life, the way that it's true
From the One who chose you, your Father in heaven
Choose life
