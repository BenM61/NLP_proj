We come into your heart when you're high on love
We come into your mind when you feel a rush
We come into your soul when your guide is gone
We come into your smile when you want some fun

We come into your feet when you jump at night
We come into your hands when you wanna fight
We come into your legs when you wanna run
We come into your smile when you want some fun

So come on feed the da-da-da-da-da
So come on feed the da-da-da-da-da
So come on feed the da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
