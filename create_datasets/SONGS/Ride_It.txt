I'll keep riding it
I'll keep riding it

Want to make some music to take me in and out of my head
Get into my grooving, tie him with my bodie instead

Your the d.j I'm the song
Take me out and turn me on
Let yourself go...!
I'll be riding it!
She'll be bumping to the beat
From the sound of the underneath
And my bodies were this parts at!
I'll be riding it!
When your spinning I'll be riding it

He's a lil rude and nasty, his temper is an overload
He gets jiggy all within, all I want to do it go

And when the base kicks in, I can dance like no ones watching me
Its a funny kinda feeling, 'cause your the only one
Who can bump it loud the way I like it!!

Your the DJ I'm the song
Take me out and turn me on
Let yourself go...!
I'll be riding it!
She'll be bumping to the beat
From the sound of the underneath
And my bodies were this party's at
I'll be riding it!
When your spinning it, I'll be riding it
When your spinning it, I'll be riding it

And when the base kicks in, I can dance like no ones watching
Its a funny kinda feeling, 'cause your the only one who can bump the way I like it!!!

Your the DJ I'm the song
Take me out and turn me on
Let yourself go...!
I'll be riding it
She'll be bumping to the beat
From the sound of the underneath
And my bodies were this parts at
I'll be riding it!

Your the DJ I'm the song
Take me out and turn me on
Let yourself go...!
I'll be riding it!
She'll be bumping to the beat
From the sound of the underneath
And my bodies were this parts at
I'll be riding it!

Your the DJ I'm the song
Take me out and turn me on
Let yourself go...!
I'll be riding it!
She'll be bumping to the beat
From the sound of the underneath
And my bodies were this parts at
I'll be riding it!
When your spinning it, I'll be riding it
When your spinning it, I'll be riding it
When your spinning it, I'll be riding it

I'll be riding it!!!!
