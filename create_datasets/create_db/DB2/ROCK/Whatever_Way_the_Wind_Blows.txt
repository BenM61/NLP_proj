From now on I'm gonna do what's right 
Been thinking this over for many long nights 
And on this decision I'm gonna follow through 
Whatever way the wind blows 

I'll be around 
I'll be around for you 
You say the whole round world has gone thoroughly mad 
It's so hard to trust in anything said 
And a sense of doubt is the only thing that's true 
I say whatever way the wind blows 

I'll be around 
I'll be around for you 
Whatever wind of change goes tearing across this world 
I'm always gonna be close beside you, girl 
From now on I'm gonna do what's right 

Been thinking this over for many long nights 
Ever since you told me that you really loved me too 
Whatever way the wind blows 
I'll be around
