Look no further, look no further.

Look no further, be still,
Don't move an inch away, stay!
Stay with one who loves you,
Look no further, dear.

No more searching, that's through,
This is journey's end, friend.
Friend has turned to lover,
Look no further, dear.

Why must you wander?
Heaven isn't far,
Rest where you are,
I'm the nearest star!

I can see you right there,
Making my life complete, sweet.
Sweet is to hold you,
Look no further, dear,
Look no further, dear.

Look no further, be still,
Don't move an inch away, stay!
Stay with one who loves you,
Look no further, dear.

Why must you wander?
Heaven isn't far,
Rest where you are,
I'm the nearest star!

I can see you right there,
Making my life complete, sweet.
Sweet is to hold you,
Look no further, dear,
Look no further, dear.
Look no further!
