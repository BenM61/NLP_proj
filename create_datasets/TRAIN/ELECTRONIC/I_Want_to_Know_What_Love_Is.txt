In Deep 
I Want To Know What Love Is 

Gotta take a little time 
A little time to think things over 
Better read between the lines 
In case I need it when I'm older 
Ooh yeah 
This mountain I must climb 
Is like the world upon my shoulders 
Through the clouds I see love shine 
It keeps me warm as life grows colder 
In my life 
There's been heartache and pain 
I don't know if I can face it again 
Can't stop now 
I've traveled so far 
To change this lonely life 
I want to know what love is 
I want you to show me 
I want to feel what love is 
I know you can show me 
Yeah 
Gonna take a little time 
A little time to look around me 
Got nowhere left to hide 
Looks like love has finally found me 
In my life 
There's been heartache and pain 
I don't know if I can face it again 
Can't stop now 
I've travelled so far 
To change this lonely life 
I want to know what love is 
I want you to show me 
I feel what love is 
I know you can show me 
Yeah 
Lord help me to be strong 
On this road I travel on 
When I'm lost and lonely 
Find me 
My journey's just begun 
And I'm not the only one 
Cause I want to know 
I want to know 
Yes I've found out 
I want you to show me 
I want to feel what love is 
Oh yeah 
I know you can show me 
I want to know what love is 
Yes I've found out 
I want you to show me 
I want to feel what love is 
You can't hide 
I know you can show me 
Yeah, Nah yeah 
Cause I want to know 
want to know 
Tell me what love is 
Do you know what it is 
Tell me what love is 
Show me what love is 
Show me what love is
