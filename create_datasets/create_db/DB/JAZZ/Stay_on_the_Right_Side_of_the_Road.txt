Come on, you sinners
Hallelujah
Come on, you sinners
Hallelujah
Come on, you sinners, come be safe
Hallelujah

Stay on the right side, sister
Stay on the right side, sister
Stay on the right side of the road

Now look out for old man Satan
He's on the wrong side waiting
Keep on the bright side of the road

Once you let that devil take your hand
You'll never get way up to heaven
Or up to hallelujah land

I see a great day dawning
You better heed my warning
Stay on the right side of the road
