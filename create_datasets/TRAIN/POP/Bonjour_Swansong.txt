Couldn't have loved you more but I know
I could have loved you longer
Crying for the moon
Couldn't have loved you less but I know
I could have loved you longer
Over all too soon

Come down to earth, how the time flies
Come down to earth, how the love lies
A broken butterfly


Trapped in a wheel, a butterfly
I can't conceal the way I feel
Now that you're gone it's been so long
Bonjour swansong

Hiding behind a song and I know
I could have loved you longer
Singing just for you
Couldn't have loved you more but I know
I could have loved you longer
Didn't make it through

Come down to land after so long
Come down to land, bonjour swansong
A broken butterfly


Caught on the wing, a butterfly
A broken wing, but still I sing
Now that you're gone it's been so long
Bonjour swansong

And I thought we'd touch eternity
But all we have are memories
I thank you for the sweetness
That you gave to me
