Evening is falling velvety black
Another day is over and you're still not back
Quarter moon is rising up over my head
With stars for companions and clouds for a bed

Dreamlike I wander through my life without you
I know that you wish me well and I wish the same for you

But oh, why'know how I miss you
Your kiss, the touch of your hand
Why did you leave me
I just don't understand
Don't know every morning if the dawn's gray or gold
All I know is another night is over
And my bed is empty and cold
I can't forget you 
Can't set myself free
I hope you find peace of mind
It's too late for me
