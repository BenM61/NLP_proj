A rose in Harlem starts to bloom
 The world is like a toy balloon
 I hear a love song and I cry
 And I know why
 Because I love you, girl
 Because I love you, girl
 You know there's nothing in the world that I wouldn't do
 Nothing in the world that I wouldn't do
 For you because I love you
 If you ask me for the moon
 Of course Id show up the moon
 No matter what you ask Ill try
 And you know why
 Because I love you, girl
 Because I love you, girl
 You know there's nothing in the world that I wouldn't do
 Nothing in the world that I wouldn't do
 For you because I love you
 Because I love you, girl
 Because I love you, girl
 You know there's nothing in the world that I wouldn't do
 Nothing in the world that I wouldn't do
 For you because I love you
