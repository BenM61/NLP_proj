Oh, I love this house, I love this house
Gives me the greatest peace I've ever known
Oh, I love to hear those conquers fall
Smash them on in suffolk stone.

And I love that here you live with me
Gives me the greatest peace I've ever known
Cos I've been too long a lonely man
Yes I've been too long a rolling stone.

So let seasons turn
Grow paradise Garden
And to my mind reassure
The native has returned.

I love the curling of your hair
Gives me the greatest peace I've ever known
I see Dylan Thomas in your face
Recite Butler Yeats now in your grace.

So let seasons turn
Grow paradise Garden
And to my mind reassure
The native has returned.

And if I had to die today
Scatter my ashes on displace
And I'll live on in your beating heart
But truth, I didn't heed a heart.

This is the greatest peace I've ever known
Oh, the greatest peace I've ever known
Oh, the greatest peace I've ever known
Only love makes house a home.

Home.

Home.

Home.

This house is home.
