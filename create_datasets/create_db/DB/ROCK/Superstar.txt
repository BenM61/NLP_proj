You're silent, in a bad mood
Playing your guitar
You are long-haired
My sulky boy

The moment I met you
I understood
I was born to
Fall in love with you

You look at me with your dark eyes
Like an October sea
You're so tall
My moody boy

Hey,
Will you love me tonight?
Woo
Will you hold me all night?

I'll sleep
With you
Baby baby baby baby
You're so good at kissing,

Dishonest and very cool
You're so good at lying,
Dishonest and very cool
I was born to

Be loved by you, but
I was born to
Be loved by you, but
You don't say a word

Just play your guitar all day
I know that
The music will always end but
Like a rose tatto

On a sailor's arm
I'm yours
We're inseparable
Nee

Will you love me tonight?
Woo
Hugged by angel
I'll sleep

With you
Baby baby baby baby
You're so good at kissing,
Dishonest and very cool

You're so good at lying
Dishonest and very cool
I was born to
Be loved by you, but

I was born to
Be loved
Nee
Will you always love me?

Woo
Hold me till the morning
I'll sleep
With you

Baby baby baby baby
Someday you'll leave me behind
Somewhere but
Anyway I'll take a bus

To the next town with you
To where the sandstorm blows
In a town somewhere I don't know
I was born to

Loved by you, but
I was born to
Loved by you, but
