I wonder what's happening to me
Things are changing so dramatically
I'll search for you,
You're not really there
Still I wonder
Knowing that you do care

I shut up, I shut up, I shut up, I shut up
I shut up, I shut up, I shut up now (x2)
I shut up now, I shut up now (x2)

He is the best thing
To come my way
Perfect picture
Baby blues in my day
He is the best thing to come around
Sleeping in his cradle safe and sound
 
I shut up, I shut up, I shut up, I shut up
I shut up, I shut up, I shut up now (x2)

I shut up, I shut up, I shut up, I shut up
I shut up, I shut up, I shut up now (x2)

I shut up now, I shut up now (x2)

Baby blues, baby blues (x4)
Sha la la, sha la la, sha la la, sha la la (x6)
