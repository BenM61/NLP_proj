I recall just walking down the street
Trying to escape the city heat
I saw her from the corner of my eye, eye, eye
Yes, she looked so good, I thought I'd die

My heart went bang-shang-a-lang, bang-shang-a-lang
Bang-shang-a-lang, bang, bang
My heart went bang-shang-a-lang, bang-shang-a-lang
Bang-shang-a-lang, bang, bang

Something said I shouldn't waste no time
If I'm ever gonna make her mine
I walked right up and said, "How do you do, do, do?"
She said, "I bet I do as good as you"

My heart went bang-shang-a-lang, bang-shang-a-lang
Bang-shang-a-lang, bang, bang
My heart went bang-shang-a-lang, bang-shang-a-lang
Bang-shang-a-lang, bang, bang

I remember when I held her tight
(Bang-shang-a-lang)
Felt like holding dynamite now
(Bang-shang-a-lang)
What's that ringing in my ear?
(Bang-shang-a-lang)
Tell me ain't those bells I hear
(Bang-shang-a-lang)

Bang, bang, bang, bang
(Shang-a-lang, shang-a-lang)
Bang, bang, bang
(Shang-a-lang-lang)
Bang, bang, bang
(Shang-a-lang-lang)

Now she's gonna spend her life with me
And we'll be as happy as can be
'Cause I love her more than I can tell, tell, tell
Sunday afternoon we'll hear the bells

And they'll go bang-shang-a-lang, bang-shang-a-lang
Bang-shang-a-lang, bang, bang
Oh, they'll go bang-shang-a-lang, bang-shang-a-lang
Bang-shang-a-lang, bang, bang

Bang-shang-a-lang, bang-shang-a-lang
Bang-shang-a-lang, bang, bang
They'll go bang-shang-a-lang, bang-shang-a-lang
Bang-shang-a-lang, bang, bang
