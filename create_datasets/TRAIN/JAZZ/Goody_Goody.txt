So you met someone who set you back on your heels - goody goody
So you met someone and now you know how it feels - goody goody
So you gave him your heart too, just as I gave mine to you
And he broke it in little pieces, now how do you do

So you lie awake just singin' the blues all night goody goody
So you think that love's a barrel of dynamite 
Hooray and hallelujah, you had it coming to ya
Goody goody for him  goody goody for me 
And I hope you're satisfied you rascal you!
