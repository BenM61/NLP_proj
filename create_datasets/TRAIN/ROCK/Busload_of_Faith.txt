You can't depend on your family
You can't depend on your friends
You can't depend on a beginning
You can't depend on an end

You can't depend on intelligence
You can't depend on sky
You can only depend on one thing, honey
You need a busload of faith to get by

Busload of faith to get by
Busload of faith to get by
Busload of faith to get by
You need a busload of faith to get by

You can't depend on the goodly hearted
The goodly hearted made lamp-shades and soap
You can't depend on your drinking
You can't depend on your dope

You can't depend on The President
Unless there's real estate that you want to buy
You can't depend on a lot of things
You need a busload of faith to get by

Busload of faith to get by
Busload of faith to get by
Busload of faith to get by
You need a busload of faith to get by

Oh yeah

You can't depend on a miracle
You can't depend on the air
You can't depend on a wise man
You can't find 'em, they're not there

You can depend on cruelty
On cruelty in borderline
You can't depend on the water, honey
You need a busload of faith to get by

Busload of faith to get by
Busload of faith to get by
Busload of faith to get by
You need a busload of faith to get by

Busload of faith to get by
Busload of faith to get by
Busload of faith to get by, baby
You need a busload of faith to get by
Get by!

Oh
