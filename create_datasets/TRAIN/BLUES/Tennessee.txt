Now there are folks who like to brag about where they came from
But when they start that stuff, I let 'em be
But it makes me feel like I wanna brag some
To know that I come from the state of Tennessee

Let's give old Tennessee credit for music
As they play it up in Nashville every day
Let's give old Tennessee credit for music
As they play it in that old Hillbilly way

Mister Red Foley came from Kentucky
Now, Ernest Tubb down in Texas, don't you see
But if all you folks out there can remember
Mister Eddy Arnold came from Tennessee

Let's give old Tennessee credit for music
As they play it up in Nashville everyday
Let's give old Tennessee credit for music
As they play it in that old hillbilly way

They make bombs they say, that can blow up our world, dear
Well a country boy like me, I will agree
But if all you folks out there can remember
They made the first atomic bomb in Tennessee

Let's give old Tennessee credit for music
As they play it up in Nashville everyday
Let's give old Tennessee credit for music
As they play it in that old hillbilly way

Let's give old Tennessee credit for music
As they play it up in Nashville everyday
Let's give old Tennessee credit for music
As they play it in that old hillbilly way
