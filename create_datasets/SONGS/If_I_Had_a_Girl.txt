I'm a rock, I'm an island, I need no one to love me
At the end of the world, there'll be no man above me
I work the live long day, to do things my way
But if I had a girl, I would tell her this

Oh yeah, "no" means "no", but your skirt comes into question
That you ask for it, will be the whore's suggestion
You'll work the live long day, to take home half the pay
So if I had a girl, I would tell her this

You gotta be bolder, better, harder, faster
Don't take no shit off no lord, no master
Don't listen when they see how far you've come
'Cause you go to work then you raise the babies
And you work some more, now listen ladies
If you think we're done, we've only just begun

Well you go to school and they tell you that you're equal
But in the big wide world that just means half the people
And one thing you don't see, there ain't no dicks on page three
So if you have a girl, please remind her this

You gotta be bolder, better, harder, faster
Don't take no shit off no lord, no master
Don't listen when they see how far you've come (how far we've come)
'Cause you got to work and you raise the babies
And you work some more, now listen ladies
If you think we're done, we've only just begun (only begun now, uh)
If you think we're done, we've only just begun (we've only begun now, uh)
And if you think we're done, we've only just begun (only begun now, uh)

Only got started
Yeah, we've only got started
Only got started
So far to go, now
So far to go, now

And if I wear my skirt short, don't mean I don't have a brain
And if cover myself from head to toe, don't mean that I'm in chains
I don't have to hate men, to know that life ain't fair
And I see how far we've got to go, but I know, I know, I know
That we'll get there
