You're holding out your hand
Are you falling
You're talking to yourself
Nobody's there
There's a burning in your heart
Like a hunger
There's something on your mind
Nobody cares

When you feel that life is dragging you down
Day by day
You've gotta break away

You're taking on the world
Taking on the world
And I swear they'll never break you
Taking on the world

Precious time
Do we know what we're fighting for
Taking time
So we don't make the same mistakes again
Take a look on the other side
Look at what we will leave behind

When you feel that life is dragging you down
Day by day
We've gotta break way

Taking on the world
Taking on the world
And I swear they'll never break me
Taking on the world
Taking on the world
And I swear they'll never break me
Taking on the world
Taking on the world

It???s easy to do
Put your trust in me
And out of the blue
We???re breaking away

What's love is it wild sorrow
Brave face
Is your heart breaking
Who cares when you
Cry freedom?
It's the right place for the
Right reasons

Taking on the world
Taking on the world
(And I swear they'll never take me)
Taking on the world
Taking on the world
(And I swear they'll never break me)
Taking on the world
(They'll never take me)
Taking on the world
(They'll never change me)

Taking on the world
Taking on the world
Taking on the world
Taking on the world
