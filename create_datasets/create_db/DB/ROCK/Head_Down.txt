Yeah
Stuck in a bad place
Running in place
Pushing my head under tow
Riding buses and living low

I'm keeping my head down
Keeping my head down
Keeping my head down
Keeping my head down
I don't care about the news of the world
The story's always the same
Nothing will ever change
I don't care about the news of the world
The story's always the same
I won't ever change
I won't ever change

Scraping up my money
Scraping my knees
Beating myself hand to mouth
Stretched my back so they can walk over me

I'm keeping my head down
Keeping my head down
Keeping my head down
Keeping my head down
I don't care about the news of the world
The story's always the same
Nothing will ever change
I don't care about the news of the world
The story's always the same
I won't ever change
I won't ever change

Ever change no, no
I don't care about the news of the world
The story's always the same
Nothing will ever change
Nothing will ever change
Ever change
Ever change
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
I don't care
