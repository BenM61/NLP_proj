Nobody else can see you the same way as myself
Fly high and touch the sky, you're the angel I adore
If only you could feel for me that I feel for you
Why do you ignore me, angel, why can't I go with you

You're an angel witch, you're an angel witch
You're an angel witch, you're an angel witch

The more love I feel for you, the more you fade away
Why can't you come and love me, do I have to stay this way
I'm going to go insane if nothing happens soon
I look out at the night to see your shadow by the moon

You're an angel witch, you're angel witch
You're an angel witch, you're angel witch

Walk through the forest I can feel that you're there
Why do you run away?
I'd never hurt you, I'd never hurt you
That's the last thing I'd do

You're an angel witch, you're an angel witch
You're an angel witch, you're an angel witch
