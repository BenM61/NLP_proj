I tried to discover
A little something to make me sweeter
Oh baby please refrain
From breaking my heart
I'm so in love with you
I'll be forever blue
That you give me no reason
Why you're making me work so hard
That you give me no
Well you give me no
You give me no soul
I hear you calling
Please, give a little respect
To me
I'm so in love with you
I'll be forever blue
That you give me no reason
Why you're making me work so hard
That you give me no
Well you give me no
You give me no soul
I hear you calling
Please, give a little respect
To me
