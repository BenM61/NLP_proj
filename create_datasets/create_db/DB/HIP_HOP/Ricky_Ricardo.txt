Hey, hey, hey, hey Lucy.
I'm home.
Where you been?
Oh, I know.
You been conga dancing?
Well me too.
Now you got some splaining to do.
This ain't about me, it's about you.
Everything you sayin' ain't true.
I never trust the b in apartment 23,
Cause she f*cking the dude in 22.
Got hands all in her gato.
Hot sauce to her taco.
Turned her face to Picasso.
Head, this is rittatto.
Boom.

But you be Lucy Goosey,
When you be on that bottle.
Say you wanna leave me,
Cause you caught me cheating.

Boom.
See that girl like va-va-va-va-voom.
Show a naked ass like uh-ba-baboon.
Watch me do my wapabaloo.
Early in the morning get the cock-a-doodle-doo.
They call me the captain.
Two girls, four tittie bouncin'.
So proud of my Johnson.
That's Johnson, Johnson, and Johnson.
I don't f*ck with no socks.
Cold feet, I'm gon' stop.
Get up off of those sheets.
Unless you doin' my laundry.
I am the white Tyrese.
Sweet lady come talk to me.
But please don't try and seduce me.
Cause girl, I really love Lucy.

Oh baby, I went Ricky Ricardo.

Cause you caught me cheating.
