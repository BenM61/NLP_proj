You're a curse
I cut my lips on your diamond hands
I'm at my worst
When you're breaking my heart's relent

There's something to say that you don't know
You're walking away when I won't go
This isn't the first time you won't stay
This isn't the last time you will hear me say

Bleed me from the heart
Need me for my heart

I saw you first
You caught me eye in a sideways glance
You're making it worse
When you told me I had my chance

So what can I say to make it clear?
You're running away when I'm still here
This isn't the first time you won't stay
This isn't the last time you will hear me say

Bleed me from the heart
Need me for my heart

Say the words
Sung the song you once wrote
It's like a curse
And I'm winding around my throat

I'd shown you the way but you won't try
You'd tear us apart but this won't die
This isn't the first time you won't stay
This isn't the last time you will hear me say

Bleed me from the heart
Need me for my heart
