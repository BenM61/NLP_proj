And loves light blue
Led me to you
Through all the emptiness that had become my home
Love's lies cruel
Introduced me to you
And that moment I knew I was out of hope

Kill me
I begged and love said no
Leave me
For dead and let me go
Kill me
I cried and love said no
Kill me
I cried and love said no

Love's icy tomb
Dug open for you
Lies in a cemetery that bares my name
Love's violent tune
From me to you
Rips your heart out and leaves you
Bleeding with a smile on your face

Kill me
I begged and love said no
Leave me
For dead and let me go
Kill me
I cried and love said no
Kill me
I cried and love said no

Loves light blue
Took me from you
And that moment I knew I was out of hope
Again

Kill me
I begged and love said no
Leave me
For dead and let me go
Kill me
I cried and love said no
Kill me
I cried and love said no

Love said no
And love said no
