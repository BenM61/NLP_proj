I used to think that I was made of stone
I only wanted to be on my own
It gets so lonely when you're on your own
And you just can't take anymore

[Chorus]
Give me no heavenly knight
Make him a devil in a fast car
Send me no angle in white
I want him just the way that you are

Other eyes are watching everywhere
Trying hard to catch us but I just don't care
I gotta touch you just to prove you're real
Not some dream I left before

Here comes that feeling that I can't understand
Can't put it in the back
Can't hold it in my hand
Gave all the love time on those one night stands
Just to see what lies in store

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Flying eat to the rising sun
For ninety minutes I'll be under the gun
I'll dream about you while I'm on the run
Til I just can't dream anymore

[Chorus]
