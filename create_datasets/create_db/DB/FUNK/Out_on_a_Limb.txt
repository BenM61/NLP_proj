Tender was the kiss when you held me captive in your sweet embrace
My lips begin to burn and my heart beats faster than the normal pace
I try to resist that familiar smile, it melts me just like wax
But what's the use, I'm yours and that means forever, there's no turning back
Baby, baby, baby, it's a mystery, ooh you got me spinning around
What have you done to me?
Suspended animation, I'm lost inside of you
I feel so insecure and yet I've never been so sure, what am I gonna do?

I'm out on a limb, I'm giving in to you again
Baby, baby, I'm out on a limb, I'm giving in to you again

Sweeter than the taste of a midnight rendevous, so sensual
The look upon your face when you love me tender and my cup was full
Softer than the sigh when it all was over and I slumbered deep
Lost inside your love like there's no tomorrow as I fall back to sleep

Baby, baby, it's a mystery, ooh you got me spinning around
What have you done to me?
Suspended animation, I'm lost inside of you
I feel so insecure and yet I've never felt so sure
What am I gonna do?

Hold me, keep me warm inside you and love me
Love me right away
This one thing is true, I would die for you

Baby, I'm out on a limb, I'm giving in to you again
Baby, baby I'm out on a limb, I'm giving in to you again
