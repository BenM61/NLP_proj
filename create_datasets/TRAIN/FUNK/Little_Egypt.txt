I went and bought myself a ticket and I sit down in the very first row, wo wo
They pulled the curtain up and when they turned the spotlight way down low, wo wo
Little Egypt came out strutting wearing nothing but a button and a bow, wo wo
Singing, yeah-yeah
Yeah yeah (a-gitcha-gitcha-gitcha)
Yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah

She had a ruby on her tummy and a diamond big as Texas on her toe, wo wo
She let her hair down and she did the hoochie-koochie real slow, wo wo
When she did her special number on a zebra skin I thought she'd stop the show, wo wo
Singing, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah (a-gitcha-gitcha-gitcha)
Yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah

She did a triple somersault and when she hit the ground
She winked at the audience and then she turned around
She had a picture of a cowboy tattooed on her spine
Saying Phoenix, Arizona, nineteen forty-nine

Yeah, but let me tell you people little Egypt doesn't dance there anymore, wo wo
She's too busy mopping and a-taking care of shopping at the store, wo wo
'Cause we got seven kids and all day long they crawl around the floor, wo wo
Singing, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah (a-gitcha-gitcha-gitcha)
Yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah (a-gitcha-gitcha-gitcha)
Yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah (a-gitcha-gitcha-gitcha)
Yeah-yeah...
