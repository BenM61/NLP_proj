I suppose I should tell you what this bitch is thinkin'
You'll find me in the studio and not in the kitchen
I won't be braggin' 'bout my cars or talkin' 'bout my chains
Don't need to shake my ass for you 'cause I've got a brain

If I told you 'bout my sex life, you'd call me a slut
When boys be talkin' about their bitches, no one's makin' a fuss
There's a glass ceilin' to break, uh-huh, there's money to make
And now it's time to speed it up 'cause I can't move at this pace

Sometimes it's hard to find the words to say
I'll go ahead and say them anyway
Forget your balls and grow a pair of tits

It's hard, it's hard, it's hard out here for a bitch
It's hard, for a bitch (For a bitch)
For a bitch, it's hard
It's hard out here for a bitch
It's hard, for a bitch (For a bitch)
For a bitch, it's hard
It's hard out here

You're not a size six, and you're not good lookin'
Well, you better be rich, or be real good at cookin'
You should probably lose some weight
'Cause we can't see your bones
You should probably fix your face or you'll end up on your own

Don't you want to have somebody who objectifies you?
Have you thought about your butt? Who's gonna tear it in two?
We've never had it so good, uh-huh, we're out of the woods
And if you can't detect the sarcasm, you've misunderstood

Sometimes it's hard to find the words to say
I'll go ahead and say them anyway
Forget your balls and grow a pair of tits

It's hard, it's hard, it's hard out here for a bitch
It's hard, for a bitch (For a bitch)
For a bitch, it's hard
It's hard out here for a bitch
It's hard, for a bitch (For a bitch)
For a bitch, it's hard
It's hard out here

A bitch, a bitch, a bitch, bitch, bitch (Bitch)
A bitch, a bitch, a bitch, bitch, bitch
A bitch, a bitch, a bitch, bitch, bitch
A bitch, a bitch, a bitch, bitch, bitch

Inequality promises that it's here to stay
Always trust the injustice 'cause it's not goin' away
Inequality promises that it's here to stay
Always trust the injustice 'cause it's not goin' away

Sometimes it's hard to find the words to say
I'll go ahead and say them anyway
Forget your balls and grow a pair of tits

It's hard, it's hard, it's hard out here for a bitch
It's hard, for a bitch (For a bitch)
For a bitch, it's hard
It's hard out here for a bitch
It's hard, for a bitch (For a bitch)
For a bitch, it's hard
It's hard out here

It's hard (For a bitch, for a bitch) For a bitch
It's hard, it's hard out here for a bitch
It's hard (For a bitch, for a bitch) For a bitch
It's hard, it's hard out here (Bitch)
