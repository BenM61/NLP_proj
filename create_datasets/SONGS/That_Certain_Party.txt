Has she got naughty eyes
Yes, she has got naughty eyes
That certain, that certain party
You know the one I mean

Sure you know the one I mean
That certain party of mine
Naughty eyes, turned up nose
Rosy cheeks and pretty clothes, not a smarty

Has she got loving ways
Sure, she has got loving ways
That certain party of mine

Hey Dean, remember the old time Vaudeville
Around nineteen twenty-four? Why, sure I do?
With those corny jokes like, ?Can you stand on your head??
Nah, it's too high
Ugh, ugh, nothing, we better sing

Has she got you know what
Yes, she has got you know what
That certain, that certain party
Has she got, I forgot

Yes, she has got, I forgot
That certain party of mine
You know what I forgot
This and that and quite a lot

Not a smarty, oh, no
Has she got everything
Yes, she has got everything
That certain party of mine

Hold on, hold on, what are you doing?
Singing in shorthand?
You're speeding
That's better

That certain, that certain party
That certain party of mine

You know what I forgot
This and that and quite a lot
What a smarty
Has she got everything

Yes, she has got everything
That certain party
That certain party
That certain party of mine
