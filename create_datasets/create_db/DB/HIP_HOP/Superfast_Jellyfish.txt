This morning you've got time for a hot, home-cooked breakfast
Delicious and piping hot in only three microwave minutes

Yo, pretty package is of frosted delights
Look, it comes with a toy
Hehe, I like that
I wanna number four, a number six, and throw in a plastic doughnut
Just enjoy the gritty crunch that tastes just like chicken
Wrappers of many bite sizes
Man, are you freakin' blind? 
That's a rock
All mixed in the potful
Momma's home-made from scratch
Well, not quite
Toasted over flames, they be tasting quite right

All hail King Neptune and his water-breathers
No snail thing too quick for his water-feeders
Don't waste time with your net, our net worth is set
Ready, go
Many know others (what?)
We be the colors of the mad and the wicked
We be bad, we re-brick it with the 24-hour sign
Shower my habits while you dine like rabbits
With the crunchy, crunchy carrots (oh, that's chicken)
Gotta have it super fast

(A whole line of breakfast you've got time for)

Super fast 
Super fast 
I come in last, but just in time for breakfast
Keep us through, keep us through
Whatever blue the night, the night throws at us
Aluminum I crush for fun
Aluminum
The sea is radioactive
The sea is radioactive

Superfast jellyfish, superfast jellyfish, superfast jellyfish, superfast jellyfish
Don't waste time (superfast jellyfish)
The sea has gone silent
What?

Everybody loves jellyfish
Everybody loves jellyfish
