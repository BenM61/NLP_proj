The first time we met
It was so plain to see
I didn't care for you
You didn't seem to care for me, oh, no, no, no, no

The next time we met
I thought "He's kinda nice"
That look that you gave me
Simply started to melt the ice, oh, oh, yeah

And then when you smiled that smile
And then when we kissed, said "Wait awhile"
I got a feeling, ahh, that you are something special

And now we're together and the world just passes us by
Yet every little thing you do makes me sigh with joy "That boy is mine"

I'm gonna love you for the rest of my life
With the kind of lovin' that's untouched
By hand and strife

Come on now, I'm gonna tell you
That when, oh, when I see your face, yeah
And, oh, when I'm in your warm embrace
I know for sure our love is something special
It is, yeah, yeah, yeah

Right now
When I see your face, oh yeah
And, oh, when I'm in your warm embrace
I know for sure 
Our love is something special
Come on now
Our love is something special
Oh yeah
Our love is something special
Oh right now 
Our love is something special
Ooh yeah
Out love is something special
