A million miles later
We walk through the valley of the darkest night
We made it through the fire
Scarred and we're bruised but our hearts will guide us
Together I know no one else is gonna last forever
You're gonna be alright, tonight

We live with no limits
We'll dance in the middle of the freezing rain
With you and I in it
Survive the eye of a hurricane

Together, we're gonna make this better
We're gonna be alright tonight

Hold tight, as long as you're by my side
Hold tight, everything's gonna be alright
Only love, only love tonight
Like stars, we're burning so bright
Hold tight, everything's gonna be alright

Everything's gonna
Everything's gonna
Everything's gonna

A million miles later
We walk through the valley of the darkest night
We made it through the fire
Scarred and we're bruised but our hearts will guide us
Together I know no one else is gonna last forever
We're gonna be alright, tonight

Hold tight, as long as you're by my side
Hold tight, everything's gonna be alright
Only love, only love tonight
Like stars, we're burning so bright
Hold tight, everything's gonna be alright

Everything's gonna
Everything's gonna
Everything's gonna

I don't wanna breathe air that you're not breathing
I don't wanna hear if your heart's not beating
If you hurt then I wanna be the one that's bleeding
Wanna be the one that's bleeding

Hold tight, everything's gonna be alright

Everything's gonna
Everything's gonna
Only love, only love tonight
Like stars, we're burning so bright
Everything's gonna
Everything's gonna
