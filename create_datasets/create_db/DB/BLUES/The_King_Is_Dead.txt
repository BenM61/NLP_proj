The king is dead, no doubt about it
We came a long way just to say goodbye
And in the end it was some old swan song

The king is dead, you'd never know it
But we got pictures of a different man
He's flesh and blood, no-one knows all the answers
Some days we just do the best we can

You changed my mind in a minute
It breaks my heart to admit it
Don't make me say

The king is dead, the show is over
We came a long way, just to turn around
Lesson learned, no-one knows all the answers
Some days we just do the best we can

You changed my mind in a minute
It breaks my heart to admit it
No-one's to blame

You let me in behind the lies
But you're no use to me life size, oh
No-one's to blame, yeah

Some days we just do the best we can

You changed my mind in a minute
It breaks my heart to admit it
Don't make me say

The king is dead
The king is dead

King is dead
King is dead
King is dead
...
