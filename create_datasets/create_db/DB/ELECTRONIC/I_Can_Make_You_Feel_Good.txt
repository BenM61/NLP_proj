I can make you feel good
Oh so good

Are you the kind who puts your heart on the line? 
Or one who stays out of reach? 
'cause unlike other guys I won't waste your time 
Just want to practice what I preach 
Girl love can be such a challenge 
A game where there can be two winners 
Unlike any sport 
It depends on the prize 
And knowing where the real thing lies 
To make a long story short

[Chorus]
Oh baby, I can make you feel good, 
(I can make you feel good) 
Let me lay this good love on ya, yeah, 
I can make you feel good, 
(I can make you feel good) 
Just say "I really want you"... 
Oh, so good

There's guys that offer you diamonds and pearls, 
Those are the wants and not the needs, no, no, 
Other guys say that they can give you the world, 
A world of love is what you'll get from me... 

Girl, those material things, 
Meant more to me before the day I found you, 
And now I truly believe, 
All the money in the world, 
Can't comfort you the way I wrap my arms around you, 
I'll always be there 

[Chorus]

Let me make you feel real good, oh so good, 
Let me make you feel real good, oh, so good, 
Let me hear it from you baby, (oh, so good) 
Let me hear it from you baby, (oh, so good) 

[Chorus]
Let me make you feel real good, oh so good, 
Let me make you feel real good, oh, so good, 
Let me hear it from you baby, (oh, so good) 
Let me hear it from you baby, (oh, so good) 

I can make you feel good

[Chorus: x2]
