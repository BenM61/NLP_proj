The world's a tiny blue-green ark
Afloat in darkest space.
And every creature lives his time
And knows his special place
And each of us is Noah

With a life all in our care
To keep against the darkness
That's flooding everywhere

We've got to walk with the lion,
Soar with the eagle,
Sing with the nightingale
And live in love and peace.

The times have made us fearful
And our fears have brought the tears
The loneliness and darkness
Have grown bitter with the years
But a light is just beyond us
and the children almost see
A world that we've forgotten
And the world they want to be

When we walk with the lion,
Soar with the eagle,
Sing with the nightingale
And live in love and peace.

The ark is getting crowded now
And each of us must know
When everything is finished here
There's no where else to go.
The beasts are here to bless us
And the faith is in their eyes
That we can find the garden
And see that sweet dawn rise

And we can walk with the lion,
Soar with the eagle,
Sing with the nightingale
and live in love and peace.

We've got to walk with the lion,
Soar with the eagle,
Sing with the nightingale
And live in love and peace.
