Look at them working in the hot sun
The pilloried saints and the fallen ones
Working and waiting for the night to come
And waiting for a, and waiting for a, and waiting for a miracle

Somewhere out there is a place that's cool
Where peace and balance are the rule
Working toward a future like some kind of mystic jewel
And waiting for a, and waiting for a, and waiting for a miracle

You rub your palm on the grimy pane
In the hope that you can see (when you're waiting)
You stand up proud, you pretend you're strong
In the hope that you can be (when you're waiting)
Like the ones who've cried, like the ones who've died
Trying to set the angel in us free
While they're waiting for a
While they're waiting for a
While they're waiting for a miracle

Struggle for a dollar, scuffle for a dime
Step out from the past and try to hold the line
So how come history takes such a long, long time?
When you're waiting for a
When you're waiting for a
When you're waiting for a miracle

You rub your palm on the grimy pane
In the hope that you can see (when you're waiting)
You stand up proud, you pretend you're strong
In the hope that you can be (when you're waiting)
Like the ones who've cried, like the ones who've died
Trying to set the angel in us free
While they're waiting for a
While they're waiting for a
While they're waiting for a miracle

While they're waiting for a
While they're waiting for a
While they're waiting for a miracle

While they're waiting for a
While they're waiting for a
While they're waiting for a miracle
