This world is a burning fire, everybody pays his price
You can't stop my desire, I'm the pirate of your paradise
I know heaven is forever, I can't stop, babe loving you
Here I dance on heavy weather, I always will be true

Just another dream, I will share you
Just another night, gonna feeling blue
Just another day, I can't say goodbye
Hit me, hit me baby

I don't lie
48 hours, come baby, hit me all night long
48 hours, oh baby make me ooh, so strong
48 hours, come hear the rhythm of my heart

I'm burning, turning, turning for a start
Oh baby, only 48 hours you can make me strong and say
Only 48 hours we'll be rocking, we'll be talking to the U.S.A.
This love is like a thunder, oh, nobody knows my way

No heartaches by the number, I can win if I don't play
Outside the gates of heaven, a love is hard to find
Close your eyes to seven, you're always on my mind
Just another dream, I will share you

Just another night, gonna feeling blue
Just another day, I can say goodbey
Hit me, hit me baby
I don't lie
