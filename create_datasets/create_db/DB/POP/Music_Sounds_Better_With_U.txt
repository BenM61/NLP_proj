Better with you
Better with you, yeah

I try to write this down
The words just don't come out
It's hard to say how you feel
Been down the longest road
Said yes when I meant no
I lost control of the wheel

'Cause you know that
Things get so bad
You've got my back
Make me wanna sing
And girl I'm singing about you
No sweeter sound
Than what I've found
No perfect love
Could be more perfect than ours

Oh baby it feels like, it feels like
Music sounds better with you baby
It feels right, it feels right
Everything's better with you

I used to think that love
Was something fools made up
'Cause all I knew was heart break
Whoa I couldn't help myself
Let this heart go through hell
There only so much a heart can take

'Cause you know that
Things get so bad
You've got my back
Make me wanna sing
And girl I'm singing about you
No sweeter sound
Than what I've found
No perfect love
Could be more perfect than ours
Ooh baby it feels like, it feels like
Music sounds better with you baby
It feels right, it feels right
Everything's better with you

Every song
Every rhyme
Every word is better with you
Everyday (Everyday)
All of the time (All of the time)
Every day
Music sounds better with you

She's my music enhancer
When the music plays, she's my dancer
When I'm around her everything's faster
Every question I have, she's the answer
I'm head over heels
Can't explain it, it's so surreal
When I'm around you, baby, you make me feel like

Everything's better with you
Ooh baby it feels like, it feels like
Music sounds better with you baby
It feels right, it feels right
Everything's better with you
Oh baby it feels like, it feels like
Music sounds better with you baby
It feels right it feels right
Everything's better with you
Music sounds better with you
Music sounds better with you
