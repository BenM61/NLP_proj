Darling, you're waiting with an open hand
Patient like a boat on land
Borne into the open sea
Oceans moving in my restless heart
Keeping us a world apart
But you were always next to me

I was the one standing in my way
I think I've always been afraid
Finally I see you now

I'm ready for you
I'm ready for you
I've been too long overdue
I'm ready for you

Patience never had to hold my hand
It never had to understand
The way you understood my head
Fortune, you're filling up my open chest
Forgiving all my open debts
And finally I see you now

I'm ready for you
I'm ready for you
I've been too long overdue
I'm ready for you

I know we're gonna feel it coming down
I know there's gonna be emergency
But you're never gonna need to worry now
'Cause I'm ready for...

I'm ready for you
I'm ready for you
I've been too long overdue
I'm ready for you

I'm ready for you (and I know, and I know I'm ready for you)
I'm ready for you (and I know, and I know I'm ready for you)
I've been too long overdue (and I know, and I know I'm ready for you)
I'm ready for you (and I know, and I know I'm ready)
