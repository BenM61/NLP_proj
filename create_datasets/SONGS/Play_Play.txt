Turn me down break me round 
Far from the big city 
I'm looking for some charm 
Not in a charmless city 

Place my face in a magazine 
It could change society 
There's only place I wanna be 
Is sitting on the sea 
Only place I wanna be 
Is sitting on the sea 

Play oh play all the concrete falls away 
Just stay oh stay out here on a dark day 

Play play all the concrete falls away 
Just stay oh stay out here on a dark day 

Take me down and wash me round 
My soul into the sea 
Clean or dirty water 
It's where I wanna be 

Take me down and wash me round 
My soul into the sea 
Can't see through walls of water 
Crashing over me 
See through walls of water 
Crashing over me 

Play play all the concrete falls away 
Just stay oh stay out here on a dark day 

Play play all the concrete falls away 
Just stay oh stay out here on a dark day
