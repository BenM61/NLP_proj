Woke up this mornin' and I crawled out of bed,
I made a cup of coffee just to clear my head.
I felt all right 'til I looked on the floor,
There was a pile of bills stacked against the door.
I went in the kitchen and drank another cup,
I sat down at the table and added it up.
When I discovered how much I owe,
I said, ooh, ooh, it's time to go.

Mailman stay away from my door,
Got too many bills I don't need no more,
I don't know what I'm gonna do, but while I'm deciding,
To save my soul, I'm going to find me a hole to hide in,

Everyday it's the same old thing,
I know in advance what the man's gonna bring.
Registered letters from all over town,
Those final reminders are gettin' me down.
I once had money, but it's all been spent,
And now the landlord said he needs the rent.
Telephone company cuttin' off my phone,
Why don't they all just leave me alone?

Mailman keep away from my door,
Got too many bills I don't need no more.
I don't know what I'm gonna do, but while I'm deciding,
To save my soul, I'm going to find me a hole to hide in.

Mailman, stay away from my door.
Mailman stay away from my door.
Mailman stay away from my door.
Mailman yea, stay away from my door, whoo
