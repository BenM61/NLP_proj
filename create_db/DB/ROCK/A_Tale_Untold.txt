Ain't no lights around this harbor
The sea has turned and gone to bed
Far off cries the lonely siren
Or is that a voice within my head
Right or wrong I knew what she was saying
Cried out her heart such a lovely face
Behind her eyes the sun is dying
Maybe the moon can take it's place
Out there ships upon the winds are dancing
Tired old hands the sails unfold
Around their eyes the wind is sighing
Maybe the end a tale untold
Far off cries the lonely siren
Maybe the end a tale untold
