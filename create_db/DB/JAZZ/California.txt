California got her right
You will have to wait
Calling from the Golden Gate

Sentimental sparrows
Keeping me awake
Funny how the morning's late
Funny how the morning's late

Come around with your heavenly smile
Come around and drag me out again
After a while we can sit and watch them all rush by
Come around and drag me out again
Come around and drag me out again

Always wanted to leave
Always felt that I'd get stopped
But I could never see myself
In anybody else's arms
In anybody else's arms

Come around with your heavenly smile
Come around and drag me out again
After a while we can sit and watch them all rush by
Come around and drag me out again
Come around and drag me out again

Always wanted to leave
Always felt that I'd get stopped
But I could never see myself
No I could never see myself
With anybody else

If you want a piece of my life
Get in line, baby get in line
If you wanna kiss then do it fast
Get in line, baby get in line
If you wanna practice, spill the past
Get in line, baby get in line
Get in line, baby get in line

California's angel
It's more than I can stand
Calling down the sunset's pain
Sentimental star unsolved
As soon as we wake
Funny in the morning state
Funny in this morning state

If you want a piece of my life
Get in line, baby get in line
If you wanna kiss then do it fast
Get in line, baby get in line
If you wanna practice, spill the past
Get in line, baby get in line
I will smile and chuckle till the last
Get in line, baby get in line
Get in line, baby get in line
Get in line, baby get in line
Get in line, baby get in line
