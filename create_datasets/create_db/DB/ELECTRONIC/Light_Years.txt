People tell me I'm no good
Cos I'm expressin' all my sentiments
Now I got to channel all my vehemence
For the benefit of my self defence
And you can be a do gooder
But true sincerity ain't charity
It can take a life time to be
How you wanna be.

You can be light years
Away from serious intention
And I thought I knew it all
Someday
I'd get to turn mankind
This way
If you don't know you can be light years
Away from your true destination. 
No conscious escalation
Until I get with good vibration
I'm never gonna get to use that
use that earthly power
Substitutes
Can never take the place of peace of mind
Losing all sense of direction.

When you're light years
Too far away to turn you back on substitution
There is no u-turn on a one way route
Goin' up when I learn to love the life I can bite the fruit
Now I got sunshine in my life.

Light years
Never to return to Babylon
See money don't make a man
But if you really want you get there anyway you can.
