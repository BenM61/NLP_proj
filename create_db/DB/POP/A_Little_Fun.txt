Let's have ourselves a little 
Let's have ourselves a little fun 
We're not under the gun 
We're not on the run, and we're feeling 
Fine, so 

Drive on down the road, take it 
Take it as far as it will go 
Drive on into 
Into this night 

Breakdown inside, another 
Another roller coaster ride, well I 
Don't hold it against you 
Don't really resent you, it's just this thing 
That I 

Try hard to understand when I 
Feel less than a man, you've got to 
Breakdown into 
Into the light 

Well I feel my emotions go cold 
As I watch your devotion unfold 

Let's have ourselves a little 
Let's have ourselves a little fun 
We've got nothing to lose 
We've got no good use for feeling down, 
So 

Turn up the radio and we can 
Sing every song we know â€˜cause I know 
We get into 
Feeling alright 

Well I've got one good reason, if I 
Seem displeased with your 
Endless good time 
Well you took me for a real good ride 

So drive on down the road and by the 
Time that we are home 
Maybe I'll begin to 
Have a little fun 
Have a little fun 
Let's have ourselves a little fun
