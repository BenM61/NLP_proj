Go!!

This ain't a test, f*ck the rest
Time to set the record straight
Talk your shit, behind my back
Let's hear you say it to my face
I've heard the words fall out your lips
You little trendy fucking bitch
The time has come to get you some
Cause I just do not give a shit

Do you take me for a fool?
How's it feel to be a tool?
See to me your just a cancer
Motherfucker war is the answer

As of now the end begins
I want to laugh but there's no joke
To eat with beasts
And run with the wolves
On the ashes you must choke
I know it's got to chap your ass
To think I just won't go away
Effects me not, I'm writing you off
I've got nothing more to say

Do you take me for a fool?
How's it feel to be a tool?
See to me your just a cancer
Motherfucker war is the answer

Get some

You want to disrespect me
you little fucking punk?
Everything I've done
To be who I am
As far as I've fucking come
I'll slap you so fucking hard
It'll feel like you kissed a freight train
F*ck you

Do you take me for a fool?
How's it feel to be a tool?
Talk your shit behind my back
See to me your just a cancer
The time has come to get you some
Motherfucker war is the answer
