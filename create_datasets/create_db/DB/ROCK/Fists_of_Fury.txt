More work, less pay is what everybody says is all that I deserve,
So why they kicking my butt and breaking my bones now,
And as the trouble flares I'm drunk who cares that this life ain't meant for me,
So I'm just holding my breath for a brand new day now,

Well go on, I'll be damned mother said I kicked off long before I could walk,
She said that I swore and I cursed long before I could talk,
For I've an infliction, a terrible thing,
Fists of fury and a tongue with a sting,
Seems such a shame but it kept us entertained now,

What's more to say? Not for a dollar a day, it's not my job or my concern,
So why am I asking you if you're alright there mate?
You've got to dial nine to get an outside line to dial nine nine nine from here,
Press one if it's urgent or two for a real emergency,

Well go on, I'll be damned mother said I kicked off long before I could walk,
She said that I swore and I cursed long before I could talk,
For I've an infliction, a terrible thing,
Fists of fury and a tongue with a sting,

Seems such a shame but it kept us entertained now,
Seems such a shame but it kept us entertained now,
Seems such a shame but it kept us entertained now.
