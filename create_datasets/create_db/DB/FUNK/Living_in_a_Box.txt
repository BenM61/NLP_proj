Woke up this mornin'
Closed in on both sides
Nothin' doin'
I feel resistance

As I open my eyes
Someone's foolin'
I found a way to break through this cellophane bag
'Cause I know what's goin' on
In your mind

I'm a livin' in a box
I'm a livin' in a cardboard box
I'm a livin' in a box
I'm a livin' in a cardboard box
I'm a livin' in a box

Life goes in circles
Around and around
Circulating
I sometimes wonder

What's movin' underground
I'm escaping
I found a way to break through this cellophane bag
'Cause I know what's goin' on
In my mind

I'm a livin' in a box
I'm a livin' in a cardboard box
I'm a livin' in a box
I'm a livin' in a cardboard box
I'm a livin' in a box

Livin'
Ahh ha
I found a way to break through this cellophane bag
'Cause I know what's goin' on
In your mind

I'm a livin' in a box
I'm a livin' in a cardboard box
I'm a livin' in a box
I'm a livin' in a cardboard box
I'm a livin' in a box
I'm a livin' in a cardboard box

I'm a livin' in a box
I'm a livin' in a cardboard box
I'm a livin' in a box
I'm a livin' in a cardboard box
I'm a livin' in a box
I'm a livin' in a cardboard box

I'm a livin' I'm a livin'....I'm a livin'
I'm a livin', I'm a livin'....I'm a livin'
I'm a livin' in a box
I'm a livin' in a box...
