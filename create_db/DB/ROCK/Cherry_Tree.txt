Take us down and all apart
Cherry Tree
Lay us out on the table

Your sharp alright

But no one is asking so leave it alone
Leave it alone
Can we
No one is asking so leave it alone
Leave it alone
Can we

Loose lips sink ships

Don't Look at me
I'm only breathing
Don't look at me I'm indiscreet
Don't look at me
I'm only breathing
Don't look at me I'm indiscreet

Your sharp alright

But no one is asking so leave it alone
Leave it alone
Can we
No one is asking so leave it alone
Leave it alone
Can we

Loose lips sink ships

Can we show
A little discipline
Can we show
A little discipline
Can we
Can we

Loose lips sink ships

Can we show
A little discipline
Can we show
A little discipline
Can we
Can we

Loose lips sink ships
