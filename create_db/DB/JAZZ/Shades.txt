These shades can hide the teardrops crying
But not the way I feel inside
These shades can only do their part oh yeah
But these shades can't hide a broken heart
These shades can hide my red red eyes
But not the hurt left by your lies
These shades can only do their part oh yeah
But these shades can't hide a broken heart
Dark shades I'll keep on wearin' as long as I'm still caryin'
For you and I still love you so oh why did you go now
These shades can hide my eyes away
But not the pain I feel each day
These shades can only do their part oh yeah
But these shades can't hide a broken heart
But these shades can't hide a broken heart
But these shades can't hide a broken heart
These shades can't hide a broken heart
