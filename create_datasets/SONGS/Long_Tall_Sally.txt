I'm gonna tell aunt Mary 'bout uncle John
He said he had the misery but he got a lot of fun
Oh baby, yeah now baby, woo baby 
Some fun tonight

I saw uncle John with long tall Sally
He saw aunt Mary comin' and he ducked back in the alley
Oh baby, yeah now baby, woo baby
Some fun tonight

Well, long tall Sally's built pretty sweet
She got everything that uncle John needs
Oh baby, yeah now baby, woo baby
Some fun tonight

Well, we're gonna have some fun tonight
Have some fun tonight, oh
Everything's all right
Have some fun tonight
Have some fun, yeah, yeah, yeah

We're gonna have some fun tonight
Have some fun tonight
Everything's all right
Have some fun tonight
Yeah, we'll have some fun
Some fun tonight
