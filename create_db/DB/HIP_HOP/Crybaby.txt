Yo, what's happenin'?
What you're cryin' for?
You know you look too damn good to be cryin'
Come here
Holla at a player
Dpg style
Ya know, ya know

When I think of our untimely end
And everything we could have been
I cry, baby I cry

Okay so it's 5 am and I still can't sleep
Took some medicine but it's not working
Someone's clinging to me and it's bittersweet
'Cause he's head over heels but it ain't that deep
I finally changed my number got a different pager
Then last Saturday your cousin called to say you're 
Trying to reach me, probably because you see that I'm with someone new

Late at night like a little child
Wandering around alone in my new friend's home
On my tippy toes, so that he won't know
I still cry baby over you and me
(Baby don't cry)

Sipping Bailey's Cream, by the stereo 
Trying to find relief on the radio (ah, what's up?)
I'm suppressing the tears, but they start to flow
'Cause the next song I hear is the song I wrote
When we first got together early that September
I can't bear to listen so I might as well drift
In the kitchen pour another glass or two and try to forget you (ya know, ya know)

Late at night like a little child
Wandering around alone in my new friend's home
On my tippy toes, so that he won't know
I still cry baby over you and me (Baby don't cry)

Baby here me when I say
Let that man be on his way
Don't even waste your time and worry 'bout how he handle things
Baby here me when I say
A playa feeling good today
You know you're too fly to even waste your time
Watch how I handle things
Man you's a fool for this
But on the real dog I'm cool with this
We doing this
D-o double G Z-Y
Kiss the girls and make them cry

Late at night like a little child (I'm like a little child) (dry your eyes)
Wandering around alone in my new friend's home (nah baby don't cry)
On my tippy toes, so that he won't know (baby don't cry)
I still cry baby over you and me (dry your eyes)

Late at night like a little child (why is it bothering him and why ?)
Walkin' around (you know you're too fly to be crying)
In my new friend's home
On my tippy toes (on my tippy toes) 
So that he won't know (so that he won't know)
(Dry your eyes) I still cry baby over you and me (I still cry)

I don't get no sleep, I'm up awake
Can't stop thinking of you and me
And everything we used to be
And could have been so perfect
Still I cry, I cry, I cry (you know, yeah)
Oh I gotta get me some sleep
Baby and I cry, cry, cry, cry (dry your eyes, no baby don't cry)
(Baby don't cry) Baby and I cry (on my tippy toes)
Cry (so that he won't know)
Cry (I still cry)
Cry 

Late at night like a little child
Wandering around alone in my new friend's home
On my tippy toes, so that he won't know
I still cry baby over you and me

Late at night like a little child
Wandering around alone in my new friend's home
On my tippy toes, so that he won't know
I still cry baby over you and me

Baby and I cry, cry, cry, cry
Baby and I cry (on my tippy toes)
Baby I cry (so that he won't know)
I still cry
Baby and I
