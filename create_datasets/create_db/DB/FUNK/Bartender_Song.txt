Bartender I really did it this time
Broke my parole to have a good time
When I got home it was 6 am
The door was locked so I kicked it in
She was trippin' on the bills
I think she was high on some pills
She threw my shit out into the yard
Then she called me a bum and slapped me real hard
And in my drunken' stuper I did what I shoulda' never done
And now I'm sittin' here, talkin' to you, drunk and on the run

I'm sittin' at a bar on the inside
Waitin' for my ride on the outside
She broke my heart in the trailer park
So I jacked the keys to her f**kin' car
Crashed that piece of shit and stepped away

You know I'll probably get ten years
So just give me beers til' they get here
Yeah I know the sun is comin' up and ya'll are probably gettin' ready for closin' up
But I'm tryin' to drown my soul I'm tired of this life on a dirt road
And everything that I love is gone and I'm tired of hangin' on

She got me sittin' at a bar on the inside waitin' for my ride on the outside
She stole my heart in the trailer park so I jacked the keys to her f**kin' car
Crashed that piece of shit and stepped away

I guess it was meant to be
Romance is misery
So much for memories
And now I'm headed for the penitentiary
See me on tv
The next cop series I am danger
I guess I shoulda' did somethin' 'bout my anger
But I never learned
Real things that don't concern I pour kerosene on everything
I love to watch it burn
You know it's my fault but I wasn't happy it was over
She threw a fit so I crashed that piece of shit

And now I'm goin' back again
Back to the pen to see my friends
And when we all pile out that county van
They're gonna ask me where I've been

I've been at a bar on the inside
And I'm waitin' for my ride on the outside
She stole my heart in the trailer park so I jacked the keys to her f**kin' car
Crashed that piece of shit and then stepped away
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na

Well I'm sittin' at a bar on the inside
And I'm waitin' on my ride on the outside
You know I crashed that piece of shit
And then I stepped away
Yeah, I stepped away
You know I crashed that piece of shit
And then I stepped away...
