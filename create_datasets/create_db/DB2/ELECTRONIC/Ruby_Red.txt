Well it seems you have a heart
I saw it once so I know it's true
You let it out on Sundays when
You let it beat me black and blue
When you went and stole my heart
I saw it go so I know it's true
It was a ruby, ruby, ruby red
It was the most precious gift I could give to you

It was as red as the sun in the evening sky
It was as red as the fire in a panther's eye
It was as red as the rose under the summer sun
Like a fire from a killer's gun

Ruby, ruby red
Shine a light onto this boy's bed
There's a street lamp glowing in my head
Oh, Ruby, ruby, ruby red

Well it seems you have a soul
You let it go so I know it's true
It was a ruby, ruby, ruby red
It keeps me warm when I'm feeling sad and blue
Well you went and stole my heart
I saw it go so I know it's true
I wrapped it up in a bouquet of barbed wire
It was the wickedest gift I could give to you

It was as red as the sun in the evening sky
It was as red as the fire in a panther's eye
It was as red as the rose under the summer sun
Like a fire from a killer's gun

Ruby, ruby red
Shine a light onto this boy's bed
There's a street lamp glowing in my head
Oh, Ruby, ruby, ruby red

Oh just like Johnny Rio baby
I need to be desired
I give up looking for my past
For the ones I left behind
Ruby red, ruby red, hey, hey, hey

Ruby, ruby red
Shine a light onto this boy's bed
There's a street lamp glowing in my head
Oh, Ruby, ruby, ruby red

It was the most precious jewel
I could give to you
Colour me red when I'm feeling blue
The colour of a kiss
In a young girl's dream
The mark of a guillotine
A drop of blood from a single thorn
Red wet sheets in the afternoon
A red light leading to my tomb
Ruby red all around my room

Ruby, ruby red
Oh shine a light onto this boy's bed
Oh, ruby, ruby, ruby red
