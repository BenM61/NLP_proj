I saw her standing? on the corner
A yellow ribbon in her hair
All my boys could not help crying?
Looky there, looky there
That's tough, she's digging? me

Young blood, yes, it is
Young blood
Young blood
Can't get you outta my mind

Just one look and I was captured
I tried to walk but I was lame
Just could not help myself from shouting?
What's your name, what's your name
Now looky here, girl, come here, baby

Young blood
Young blood
Young blood
Can't get you outta my mind

What crazy stuff, she looked so tough
I had to follow her all the way home
Then things went bad, I met her dad
What's he say, boys? ?you'd better leave my daughter alone?
I couldn't sleep a wink for trying?
I saw the rising? of the sun
All night long my heart was crying?
She's the one, she's the one
I saw her first, she wants me

Young blood, yes, it is
Young blood
Young blood
Can't get you outta my mind

What crazy stuff, she looked so tough
I had to follow her all the way home
Then things went bad, I met her dad
Look, get your hands off my daughter
Before I play a little Hank Aaron melody on your head
Ya understand
I couldn't sleep a wink for trying
I saw the rising of the sun
All night long my heart was crying
She's the one, she's the one
Let's take a walk, sugar, just get your car

Young blood, yes, it is
Young blood
Young blood
Can't get you outta my mind
