Still banging with the set
Thirty thousand in the P.J.

Surfing through the village, bust it, bust it up
Diamonds on me flooded bust down

Freddy Kruger with the glove
Michael Jackson with the glove

Bed rocking like Flintstones
Doing numbers in my zip code
Squad with it on flipmode

My whole team lit, it's simple
What you want? Just tell me what you want, baby
What you doing? Let's just start with foreplay
When I perform, your shaking make the bed break
Until the the morning
Your lips turn me on, baby
Smoke one with me, let's get faded
Hit the showers, heat it up, still wide awake
I don't even know, she say she got a man at home
I love her anyway
And if that nigga say he love you like he do
Where your wedding ring?
