I built a castle round my heart
I wear my courage like a mask
From the blackout to the blue sky
I see reflections in your eyes
In the colours of your love

And my heart is like a battlefield
You made me surrender
And you light me up like gasoline
Your love is like friendly fire

Your love is like friendly fire

Now we burn up until we glow
'Cause friendly fire is all we know
With every heartbeat I'm losing my shadow
I paint my life in red and gold 
And the colours of your love

And my heart is like a battlefield
You made me surrender
And you light me up like gasoline
Your love is like friendly fire

Your love is like friendly fire

And my heart is like a battlefield
You made me surrender
And you light me up like gasoline
I'm dying your friendly fire

Your love is like friendly fire
