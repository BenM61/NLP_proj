Angel, angel from the sky
Came right down to sit beside
This lonely yearning heart of mine
That now, folks, feels sublime

Now I`m a walkin`, talkin` and a spinnin`
I can`t keep my face from grinnin`
Things are roarin`, soarin`, oh what a feelin`
And to think it`s just beginnin`

Angel with a lariat
Carry me home sweet chariot
With you

Angel toss your rope around
Yank me up from the ground
Sound the trumpets, send a hue
Ascending angels through the blue

I feel emancipation
No, I don`t worry
Set my bugaboos down to worry
There`s no aggravation
There`s no worry
For I have found a true love surely

Angel with a lariat
Carry me home sweet chariot
With you

Angel with a lariat
Carry me home sweet chariot
With you, yeah

With you
Angel
