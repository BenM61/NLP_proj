All I need is what you've got
All I'll tell is what you're not
All you know is what you hear
I get this way when you come near

Then I know it's gone too far
Uh oh, I touched your star
And it felt so right
Just like the hush of midnight
And then you said
With me it's touch and go
It's touch and go 

All I need is you tonight
I'm flying like a cement kite
In your headlock on the floor
Who could ever ask for more

And I know it's gone too far
Uh-oh, I touched your star
And it felt so right
Just like the hush of midnight
And then you said
With me it's touch and go uh oh
It's touch and go, oh oh oh

All I want is you tonight
I guess that dress does fit you tight, yeah
You know that look does make me shake
It almost looks too good to fake

And I know it's gone too far
Uh oh, I touched your star
And it felt so right
Just like the hush of midnight
And then you said
With me it's touch and go uh oh
Touch and go uh oh oh

It's touch and go uh oh oh
Touch and go uh oh oh

It's touch and go u hoh oh
Touch and go, touch and go

Oh, it's touch and go 
Oh oh oh (Touch and go) touch and go 

All I need is what you've got
