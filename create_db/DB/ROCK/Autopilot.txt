I'm trying to connect with you
To see the world the way you do
Try and understand what's in your head
I'm hearing what you said

'Cause I wanted to say
When I see you this way
Don't ever let it break your heart
I'll go back to the start
I'll watch you fall apart

Feels like an empty space
You don't enjoy the taste
I just need a place to hide
Somewhere to make you right
If this isn't what you want
Head back to your own haunt
And you'll find a missing piece
Or just a big relief

Maybe you lost control
Fallen into a hole
The way that it was before
It's all that you're looking for
You just need to take a step back

This autopilot kicking in
You're feeling like you'll never win
Hey, maybe I can help you out
Don't fall into your doubts
I hear you screaming out

Feels like an empty space
You don't enjoy the taste
I just need a place to hide
Somewhere to make you right
If this isn't what you want
Head back to your own haunt
And you'll find a missing piece
Not just a big relief

Maybe you lost control
Fallen into a hole
The way that it was before
It's all that you're looking for
A lover is all you need
Someone that you can read
Day in and day out
Means this one is all, all about

Somebody you need
Somebody you need
Somebody you need
Somebody you need

Feels like an empty space
You don't enjoy the taste
I just need a place to hide
Somewhere to make you right
If this isn't what you want
Head back to your own haunt
And you'll find the missing piece
Somebody that you need

Somebody you need
Somebody you need
Somebody you need
Somebody you need
Somebody you need
Somebody you need
