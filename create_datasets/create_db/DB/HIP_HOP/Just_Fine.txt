Ooh, I might, ooh, I might
I think you should trust in me
Ooh, I might, (doin' just fine) ooh, I might
I think you should trust in me

Yeah winter know I'm the cold one, was sleeping then
But now I have awoken, kiss chase in school
I was never chosen
Now I get girls that are better than my old ones
And better than your new ones

Tell a hater, "Do one"
I am such a nuisance
MOBOS with a swanky suit and some sparkly Louboutin
Wardrobe full of different fabrics, I don't know what to choose from
My mind's all over the place, I cannot choose one

Kid's doin' just great
I'm doin' just great now
Things ain't ever what they make out
That's why I gotta stay out
Man I grind 'til I gotta skate out
All the games that they play, I play, ow
We don't share the same traits
So I'm doin' just fine

I'm doin' just fine
Doin' just great
I'm doin' just fine
Ooh, I might
(I think you should trust in me)
We don't share the same traits
So I'm doin' just fine

Hate on me on a sly, that's fine 'cause I don't care
Chattin' off behind my back, that's facts 'cause I've got burnin' ears
My glow up is a hater's hell on Earth, I hope they burnin' well
They sit and watch me shine
Doin' up Big Ben 'cause it's my time

Tell a hater, "Do one"

Doin' just fine
Ooh, I might
(I think you should trust in me)
