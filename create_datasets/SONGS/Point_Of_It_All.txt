I can't stay away from you too long
Even if I do I'll always call
Checkin' on you make sure you're OK
Be the one to brighten up your day, yeah yeah

And the point of it all
Is I love you, yeah
You know I love you baby

My days seem long
Whenever we're apart
It's like someone has
Thrown away my heart
You're a major part of my life
And no matter what the
Storm may bring
I'm fine with you

And the point of it all
Is I love you
And the reason for it all
Is I love you

(I love you girl) Oh I love
Oh I love you
(Oh I love you girl) Oh I love you girl, yeah

I can't stay (I can't stay away too long)
I can't stay away from you baby (I can't stay away too long)
Don't wanna be without you 
I need you (I can't stay away too long)
O why don't you stay around for awhile 
(I can't stay away too long)

And the point of it all
And the point of it all
And the point of it all
And the point of it all
Oh oh, and the reason for it all
And the point of it all
Is I love you
Yeah, I love you, love you, love you, love you, love you

Whenever we're apart
It damn near starves my heart
And I don't ever want to be apart
