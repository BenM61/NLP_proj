I'm searching for the now
I'm looking for the real thing, yeah

Head through a blue haze
Waiting for the musical craze
We gotta taxi for Mr. Nelson
Taxi for Mr. Nelson

Rebellious Jukebox yeah
Rebellious Jukebox, oh

No sounds at first came out
This machine had dropped out
But it made music to itself
Made music for itself

Rebellious Jukebox yeah
Rebellious Jukebox now

I'm looking for the home of the real
I want a happy time now

Drinkers from the slaughterhouse
Weren't happy and went out
Noise resounds aloud
Noise resounds the lounge

Rebellious Jukebox yeah
Rebellious Jukebox oh

I sidled up to a fruit machine
This I was imagining:
Some drinkers dancing at the bar
Drinkers dancing for the bar

Rebellious Jukebox yeah
Rebellious Jukebox now

I'm searching for the now
I'm looking for the real thing yeah
