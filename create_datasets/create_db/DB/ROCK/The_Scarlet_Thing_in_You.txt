From the world to the dreaming fields of light 
Yeah from the soaking mud 
Gonna fly up to the sky
To the scarlet thing in you 
On a long lost ocean wave of light
Submerged and unafraid 

I saw you
You were one
I saw you 
You were one

No way back to recall the way
Cause I threw out all the why's
Spinning with the spider in the cave
Found the scarlet thing in you 
Where the birds can't reach
No words can teach
Spinning in the cave
For the scarlet thing in you 

I saw you, you saw me 

I saw you 
You were one
I saw you 
You were one 

Spinning in the cave 
For the scarlet thing in you
