Here comes the action 
Here it comes at last 
Lord give me a reaction 
Lord give me a chance 

You should follow me down 

Satellite towns 
Colour in your sound 
I've been ten feet underground 
Gotta get out of this satellite town 

Here comes some action 
The sound of nightlife 
Gotta get out to get conversation 
Gotta get out to get pissed tonight 

whether you live alone 
or your trying to find your way in this world 
You better make sure you don't crack your head on the pavement man 
You getta get up and shout 
It's been programmed 
It's a dangerous place man 
It's a dangerous place 

You should follow your way down 

Satellite towns 
There's no colour in your sound 
I've been ten feet underground 
Oh black and white town 

You should follow me down 

There's no colour in your sound 
In black and white town 

You took me underground 
In black and white town
