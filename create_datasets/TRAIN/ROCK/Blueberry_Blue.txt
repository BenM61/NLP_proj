Up in the sky there's a castle I built just for you
It's very special and only accepts what is true
In that world of lavender things
You'll find baby blue angels playing musical strings

In love's world of blueberry blue

Peppermint leaves on lollipop trees, just open your eyes
Come take my hand lets go for a ride on blue butterflies
I'm so glad I'm in love with you
Stay with me and together we will share forever

Love's world of blueberry blue

Look at the moon it's a big blue balloon, it's a blueberry night
Look at the sun it's a strawberry one

In love's world of blueberry blue
Love's world of blueberry blue
Love's world of blueberry blue
