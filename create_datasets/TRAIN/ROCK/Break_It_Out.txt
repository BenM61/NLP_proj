Please help this is my mayday
I?m out of reach I got lost on the way
I know what you say is true
I?m going anywhere but here with you
I know that I can be wrong
I always listen to the same sad songs

Please give me the chance to live
Forgetting something I still don?t believe
I tried yes I jumped around
I ended up falling on the ground
I know that I can die soon
So use a fork to stick me not a spoon

Just break it out
Just break it out today
I?m gonna pretend that you never went away
Just break it out
Just break it out today
I?m losing my mind

Just break it out
Just break it out today
I?m gonna pretend that you never went away
Just break it out
Just break it out today
Just losing my mind

It's not the same
It's not goodbye
But everytime you walk around
I lose control and follow
Everywhere you go
Everywhere you go
And I know that it may hurt so much
But I just can't take control of that
Start to walk and follow
Everywhere you go
Everywhere you go

everywhere you go
Everywhere you go

everywhere you go
Everywhere you go

everywhere you go
I will follow you

'cause I'd be wasting my whole life
You're my real love
And I can't let go

Please don't turn your head
Please don't turn your head
I don't want you to see
What I'm going to be
I'm fading away tonight

Just break it out
Just break it out today
I?m gonna pretend that you never went away
Just break it out
Just break it out today
I?m losing my mind

Just break it out
Just break it out today
I?m gonna pretend that you never went away
Just break it out
Just break it out today
Just losing my mind
