To dream the impossible dream
To fight the unbeatable foe
To bear with unbearable sorrow
To run whew the brave dare not go

To right the unrightable wrong
To love pure and chaste from afar
To try when your arms are to weary
To reach the unreachable star

This is my quest, to follow the star
No matter how hopeless, no matter how far
To fight for the right,  without question or pause
To be willing to pass into hell for a heavenly cause
And I know, if I'll only be true to the glorious quest

That my heart lies peaceful and calm
When I'm laid to my rest

And the world will be better for this
That one man scorned and covered with scars
Still strove with his last once of courage
To reach the unreachable star

This is my quest, to follow the star
No matter how hopeless, no matter how far
To fight for the right , without question or pause

And to dream the impossible dream
The impossible dream
The impossible dream
The impossible
