You should know, now you know what you got me 
So serious, you don't need i hit the ground running 
Slow up, you don't make for this heat 
Arma me, you just like me roll with it as it comes 
Unravel the mystery, so plain to me 
'Cause nothing ever skips my beat like it does 
I'm done with this history be 
Just skip to my beat 
Let's sit and then I hear your 

Heart beat loud 
Heart beating so loud 
Heartbeat, are you ready to bring this beat around? 
Heartbeat, to pieces down, you make me 
Heartbeat, are you ready to bring this beat around? 
Heartbeat, to pieces, that's how you make me 

Take a little closer, come up to my speed 
Your destiny creeping, at the tip on this shoulder 
Now got the things down to my seat 
I begin with the condolence to carry this over and 
Know it hasn't commenced to beat 
Through friends and beats, on between frequencies like a drum 
All under the waves of this heat 
You feat to my deep 
It's quiet when I hear your 

Heart beat loud 
Heart beating so loud 
Heartbeat, are you ready to bring this beat around? 
Heartbeat, to pieces down, you make me 
A stereo sound 
Heart beat loud 
Heart beating so loud 
Heartbeat, are you ready to bring this beat around? 
Heartbeat, to pieces down, you make me 

Heartbeat, are you ready to bring this beat around? 
Heartbeat, to pieces down, you make me 
A stereo sound
