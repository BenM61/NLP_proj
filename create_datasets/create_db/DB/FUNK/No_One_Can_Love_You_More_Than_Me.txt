Can't believe that you think it's best that we part
We had good times but understood from the start
Time alone won't decide our fate
And now you're leaving, it's much too hard to take
Won't you give love a second chance?

'Cause no one can love you more than me
No one can feel your every need
No one can love, the way that I do
No one can give like I give to you

I can love you better, uh huh
I can love you better

You decided now, I won't stand in your way
There's no doubt that you really mean what you say
You want the freedom to love someone else
Well, I won't stop you but, darling, ask yourself
Is your life what you want it to be?

'Cause no one can love you more than me
No one can feel your every need, oh
No one can love, the way that I do
No one can give like I give to you
Oh, no one can love the way that I do
No one can give like I give to you

I can love you better, uh huh
I can love you better, uh huh
I can love you better, uh huh

Darling ask yourself
Is your life what you want it to be?

'Cause no one can love you more than me
No one can feel your every need
Oh, no one can love the way that I do
No one can give like I give to you

No one can feel your every need
Oh, no one can love
No one can give like I give to you
No one can feel your every need
Oh, no one can love
