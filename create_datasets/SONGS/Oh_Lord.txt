(Alright let me tell you)

Jullian
It's a hungry world
They're gonna eat you alive son, yeah
Oh Jullian
When the fangs sink in
I'll spit you but then I gotta throw you back in

You just try and sleep, even though you're alone
You just close your eyes boy and dream of home
And light is always up, you just keep that in mind
When you wake in the morning you'll be satisfied

'Cause there is always a wrong to your right
And there will always be a war somewhere to fight
And god knows I've had some rough fucking yeahs (ooh)
Oh lord, oh lord, keep on keeping on

Jullian
I thought I told you this
But I guess I was wrong, yeah yeah
Oh Jullian
It probably scares you now
In the future it counts you got to trust me trust me, yeah

So lock this song away, for a darker day
When you're down on your knees, screaming oh lord
I am always there, you just keep that in mind
When you wake in the morning you'll be satisfied

'Cause there is always a wrong to your right
And there will always be a war somewhere to fight
And god knows I've had some rough fucking years (ooh)
Oh lord, oh lord, keep on keeping on.

La la la la

'cause there is always a wrong to your right
And there will always be a war somewhere to fight
God knows I've had some rough fucking years (ooh)
Oh lord, oh lord, keep on keeping on.
