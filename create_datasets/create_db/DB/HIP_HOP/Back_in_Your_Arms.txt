Oh! 
Can it be I stayed away too long, 
Did I leave your mind while I was gone. 
Can it be I stayed away too long, 
Did I leave your mind while I was gone. 

Girl I never meant to say goodbye, never meant to make you cry. 
But it wasn't my fault. 
I'll do everything

I can to be a better man. 
So look into my heart and know.

I wont be cool, till I'm back in your arms.
Girl I need you, I want to be back in your arms.
I wont be cool, till I'm back in your arms.
Girl I need you, I want to be back in your arms.

I hope to get another chance, a chance to be your man. 
Cause I miss you so much don?t
Let another take

My place. 
My love to be erased. 
So look into your heart and know.

I wont be cool, till I'm back in your arms.
Girl I need you, I want to be back in your arms.
I wont be cool, till I'm back in your arms.
Girl I need you, I want to be back in your arms.

You are my number 1
The only one I love
The only one that makes my dreams comes true
Come back to me
Forget about the past
I want to make it last, forever

I wont be cool, till I'm back in your arms.
Girl I need you, I want to be back in your arms.
I wont be cool, till I'm back in your arms.
Girl I need you, I want to be back in your arms.
