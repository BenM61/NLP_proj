Funny how the circle turns around
First you're up and then you're down again
Though the circle takes what it may give
Each time around it makes it live again
Funny how the circle is a wheel
And you can steal someone who is a friend
Funny how the circle takes you to fly
And if it's right it brings it back again.

Funny how the circle turns around
You think you're lost and then you're found again
Though you always look for what you know
Each time around is something new again
Funny how the circle is a wheel
And you can steal someone who is a friend
Funny how the circle takes you to fly
And if it's right it brings it back again.
