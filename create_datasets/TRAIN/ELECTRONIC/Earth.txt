Let me be the rain 
You thirst for 
Let me be the sun 
That you adore 
And let my sweet, sweet ocean 
Caress your shore 
Let your heart 
Search no more 

You're my earth 
Mmm 
Paradise 
I say you're my earth 
My earth, my my 
You're my earth 
You're my earth 
Sweet paradise 
I say you're my earth 

There's no place I'd rather be 
Your beauty is surrounding me 
For your tears black orchids bloom 
Orchids bloom 
My soul is fed by you 
Fed by you 
The wanting with birth, then death 
It's back to dirt 
Home, to you 

You're my earth 
In paradise 
I say you're my earth 
My earth, my my 
You're my earth 
You're my earth 
Sweet, sweet paradise 
I say you're my earth 

Sweet, sweet 
Mmm 
Sweet, sweet paradise 

I searched for you all over the world 
Yes, search 
Searched for you 
All my life 

I've searched, 
Searched for you 
Searched for you all my life 
Life 
Mmm 
Yeah 

Oh I
Mmm 
I've searched, 
Searched for you 
Searched for you all my life 

I've searched, 
Searched for you 
Searched for you all my life 
Oh I 

Listen to my heart speak 
Bathe in the warmth of the morning sun 
Morning sun, morning sun 
I wait for you 
I wait for you 
Hmm 
Bathe in the warmth of the morning sun 
Morning sun, morning sun 
My earth 

Bathe in the warmth of the morning sun 
I wait for you, I wait for you 
Bathe in the warmth of the morning sun 
I wait for you, I wait for you 
Bathe in the warmth of the morning sun 
I wait for you, I wait for you.
