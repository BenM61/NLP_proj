Leave me dry a hundred times just to turn me down
Just to turn me down
A little time, a little tease
A little more of your kiss, what I really need
Yeah, I really need, yeah

Push me down to make sure that I
Got a taste, got a taste
I don't know how, how much longer
I can wait, I can wait

Don't leave me low, don't leave me low
Don't leave me low, don't let me go
Don't f me up, don't f me up
Don't make me beg
Don't leave me low, don't leave me low
Don't leave me low, don't let me go
Don't f me up, don't f me up
Don't make me beg (don't make me beg for you girl)

Know you well, know you want
Everything for yourself, baby, give me some (give me some)
Yeah, won't you give me some? (Give me some)
Yeah, use me once (once), use me twice (twice)
If you could, yeah, you would half a million times
But you never do me right, oh, yeah
