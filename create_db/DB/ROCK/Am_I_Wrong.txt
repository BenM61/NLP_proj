There's too much
That I keep to myself
And I turn my back on my faith
It's like glass
When we break
I wish no one in my place

And I've seen
You don't need their seeds
When their dirt goes in deep
And I'm lost in sleep

I can't stay
In this place
I can't stand
When the room turns round
On my fate
You give no guarantees
There's no promise
I can keep

I can't stand
I can't see my way
I feel blind
On my feet
I can't stay too long
Am I wrong?

Goodbye, lay the blame on luck
Goodbye, lay the blame on luck
Goodbye, lay the blame on luck
Goodbye, lay the blame on luck
Goodbye, lay the blame on luck
Goodbye, lay the blame on luck

I'm so tired
Of my mood
And sleep comes
With a knife, fork and a spoon
You're so pale
In your face
You let life
Get in your way

And I've seen
You don't need their seeds
When their dirt goes in deep
And I'm lost in sleep
Am I wrong?

Goodbye, lay the blame on luck
Goodbye, lay the blame on luck
Goodbye, lay the blame on luck
Goodbye, lay the blame on luck
