Am I right or wrong?
'Cause I risk it all to make you miss me babe
If I let it go then baby you'll never the time that we waste
And you promise me you would change, well never do

Make you believe we got it all

Play with you like a barbie doll
Say I love you then I break it off

Between faded walls
Late at night is that your boss who calls, huh?
And if I overthought or maybe I'm too involved
Correct me if I'm wrong

Make you believe we got it all
I'll be the girl to break your heart
I get it from you

Play with you like a barbie doll
Say i love you then I break your heart
I get it from you, yeah
