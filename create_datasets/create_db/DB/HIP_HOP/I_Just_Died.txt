Staring in the mirror as I
Start to carefully contemplate 
Just really how deep is this thing I have for you
It's wearing on my heart
And from the start you know I tried, steadily denied
Friendship turn to love
I know you probably think that I'm so strange stuttering 
On every word when you look my way, why?
And maybe it's all in my mind
But when we hugged goodbye I had butterflies
I just died, yeah

I just died in your arms tonight
Don't want nobody to bring me back to life
I just died in your arms tonight, hey
I just died in your arms
I just died in your arms tonight, tonight

Your finger touched my lips
As I tried to explain maybe why you 
And I should hide from such a love affair
My friends think that I'm so insane to fight this feeling, 
But my life's at stake
Your embrace, thoughts won't erase
Every now a minute of the day I wait 
And hope and pray that you might stay
And now you're moving oh so closely
Killing me so softly, so softly
I just died

I just died in your arms tonight
Don't want nobody to bring me back to life
I just died in your arms tonight, hey
I just died in your arms
I just died in your arms tonight, tonight

I just died in your arms tonight
Don't want nobody to bring me back to life
I just died in your arms tonight, hey
I just died in your arms
I just died in your arms tonight, tonight

Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa

I just died in your arms tonight
Don't want nobody to bring me back to life
I just died in your arms tonight, hey
I just died in your arms
I just died in your arms tonight, tonight

I just died in your arms tonight
Don't want nobody to bring me back to life
I just died in your arms tonight, hey
I just died in your arms
I just died in your arms tonight, tonight
