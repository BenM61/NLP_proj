I might catch some perch...yeahhh...
Ahhh...keep it rollin here...

Take you, on a lurch
On a, little date to church
Take you and her
On a, a little date to church

La,la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
Gimme one more
La, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la

Take your, honor fast
I'm going to a little bit mass
Come along, it can't hurt
We're on a, a little date to church

C'mon sing!

La, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
One more
La, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la

Let me tell you now...
Old Satan's looking out for you
He'll get you by the night's through
Oh, we haven't much time alive
Take me down the hall...

Sitting in a pew
Well ain't we the chosen few
Might not help, but it can't hurt
On a, a little date to church

La, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la

Deliver us, Reverend
What's that?

On a little date to church
