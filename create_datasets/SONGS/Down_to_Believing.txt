We found it hanging from a cloud that time we went up there
It looked like diamonds and pearls
It was so much of it I wore a little in my hair
Everyone said silly girl

Coming down it wasn't easy but we tried our best
Said we used it up and didn't put any back
Now you look so surprised cause there ain't none left
And you're just empty-hearted and sad

I guess it comes down to believing
And whether we do or we don't
Guess it comes down to staying or leaving
And whether we will or we won't

Staring down at the ground ain't gonna help us none
There's no need in making this hard
Hey life's too long to wake up everyday without someone
Who likes all your scratches and scars

I guess it comes down to believing
And whether we do or we don't
Guess it comes down to staying or leaving
And whether we will or we won't

Anybody ever loved anybody knows this is part of the deal
Just have to hold on for ever after
It's all gone

Then I guess it comes down to believing
And whether we do or we don't
I guess it comes down to staying or leaving
And whether we will or we won't
And whether we will or we won't
And whether we will or we won't
