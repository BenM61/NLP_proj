Bet you think I'm staying home every night
Bet you think I can't wait to hold you tight
But I'm not thinking of you at all
While you're gone, I'm having a ball
But all at once I stumble and fall just when I
See you walking by with somebody new
See you both having fun like we used to do
So I try to stand proud and tall
Deep inside I feel oh-so small
Because I know I'll stumble and fall every time

I'll stumble, stumble and fall right down
Stumble, stumble right on the ground like a clown
Every time you're around

Like a clown I stumble and fall
Wish I never saw you at all

So I try to stand proud and tall
Deep inside I feel oh-so small
Because I know I'll stumble and fall every time

Like a clown I stumble and fall
Wish I never saw you at all
Like a clown I stumble and fall
Wish I never saw you at all
