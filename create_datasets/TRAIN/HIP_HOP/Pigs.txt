This pig harassed the whole neighborhood
Well this pig worked at the station
This pig he killed my homeboy
So that fuckin' pig went on a vacation

This pig he is the chief
Got a brother pig, Captain O'Malley
He's got a son that's a pig too
He's collectin' pay-offs from a dark alley

This pig is known as a Narco
If he's a pig or not, we know that he could be
This pig he's a fuckin' fag
So all his homepigs they call him a pussy

Well this pig he's really cool
So in this class we know he rides all alone
Well this pig's steady eatin' donuts
While some motherfuckers out robbin' your home

This pig he's a big punk
And I know that he can't stand the sight of me
'Cause pigs don't like it when ya act smart
And when ya tell 'em that your a group from society

This pig works for the mafia
Makin' some money off crack
But this little pig got caught
So when he gets to the Pen it's all about the pay-back

'Cause once he gets to the Pen
They won't provide the little pig with a bullet-proof vest
To protect him from some mad nigga
Who he shot in the chest and placed under arrest
 
And it's all about breakin' off sausage
Do ya feel sorry for the poor little swine?
Niggas want to do him in the ass
Just to pay his ass back, so they're standin' in line

That fuckin' pig

Look what he got himself into

Now they're gonna make some pigs feet outta the little punk

Anybody like pork-chops?

How 'bout a ham sandwich?
How 'bout a ham sandwich?
