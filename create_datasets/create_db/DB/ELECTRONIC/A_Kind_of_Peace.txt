Being here in the darkness, starless sky
It's quieter than a church before the crowds arrive
And the world is mine
And no one else sees with my thanks and love in my thoughts
And wishes to give and to ask
It's a kind of peace

It's a kind of peace 
It's a kind of peace
It's a kind of peace

With the years doors have been locked and windows closed
And the things I'm sure I knew are no longer due
But I see comfort in my home in my heart
To make a kind of peace
It's a kind of peace

And above me
If there is nothing and no one knew I really care
It's just a now, a now I prefer
Not the future and not the past
So put the chairs to one side and let us dance
It's a strange kind of peace
It's a kind of peace
It's a strange kind of peace
It's a kind of peace

Being here in the darkness, starless sky
It's quieter than a church before the crowds arrive
And the world is mine
And no one else sees with my thanks and love in my thoughts
And wishes to give and to ask
It's a kind of peace

It's a kind of peace
