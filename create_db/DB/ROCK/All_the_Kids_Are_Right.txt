You heard that we were great
But now you think we're lame
Since you saw the show last night
You hoped that we would rock
Knock it up a notch
Rockin' was nowhere in sight
And its never good when it goes bad
No one likes to feel like they've been had
And it may be ok
But you won't wear our t-shirts now
Anymore
First the band looked wired
Then the band looked tired
Sluggish and a little slow
He's walking through the set
As drunk as he could get
And what the hell was wrong with joe?
And you could tell the crowd was fading fast
Every song we played looser than the last
And it may be ok
But you won't wear our t-shirts now
All the kids, they hold a grudge
Their minds are logged onto the net
And all the kids, they hold a grudge
You fail them and they won't forget it
All the kids, they're tired and turn away
They saw what you did
You're all wrong and all the kids are right
You heard that we were great
But now you know we're lame
Since you saw the show last night
You hoped that we would rock
You wished that we'd just stop
And finally we said "good night"
When we had returned for the encore
You and half the room had headed for the door
No one wanted more
All the kids, they hold a grudge
Their minds are logged onto the net
And all the kids, they hold a grudge
You fail them and they won't forget it
Next!
