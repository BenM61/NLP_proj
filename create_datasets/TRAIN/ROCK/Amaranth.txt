Baptized with a perfect name
The doubting one by heart
Alone without himself

War between him and the day
Need someone to blame
In the end, little he can do alone

You believe but what you see
You receive but what you give

Caress the one, the Never-Fading rain in your heart
The tears of snow-white sorrow
Caress the one, the hiding amaranth
In a land of the daybreak

Apart from the wandering pack
In this brief flight of time
We reach For the ones who ever dare

You believe but what you see
You receive but what you give

Caress the one, the Never-Fading rain in your heart
the tears of snow-white sorrow
Caress the one, the hiding amaranth
In a land of the daybreak

Caress the one, the Never-Fading rain in your heart
the tears of snow-white sorrow
Caress the one, the hiding amaranth
In a land of the daybreak

Reachin', searchin' for something untouched
Hearing voices of the Never-Fading callin'
Callin'
Callin'

Caress the one, the Never-Fading rain in your heart
the tears of snow-white sorrow
Caress the one, the hiding amaranth
In a land of the daybreak

Caress the one, the Never-Fading rain in your heart
(Rain)
The tears of snow-white sorrow
Caress the one, the hiding amaranth
(Hide)
In a land of the daybreak day-break!
