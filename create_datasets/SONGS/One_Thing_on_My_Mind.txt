Oh right
Put on your coat and hat
'Cause I like it like it like that
Honey, slip on your shoes
About to rock away your blues
Everything you like, I'm gonna make it right
And baby there's only one thing on my mind oh, yeah

Now tell your momma not to wait,
We may be a little late
If things go right, we may just be all night
Well, I'm feelin' pretty hot
And that's when I like it a lot

And baby there's only one thing on my mind
We're gonna have a good time
We're gonna let it all unwind
I'll foot the bill and have some fun if you will

We gotta do it tonight
While the time is so right
We'll have a good time,
Havin' a party tonight

Oh yeah havin' a party tonight
Put on your coat and hat
'Cause I like it like it like that
Moma, slip on your shoes
About to rock away your blues
Everything you like, I'm gonna make it right
And baby there's only one thing on my mind oh, yeah
We're gonna have a good time
We're gonna let it all unwind
I'll foot the bill and have some fun if you will

We gotta do it tonight
While the time is so right
We'll have a good time
Havin' a party tonight, right here on the spot
Everything's alright have some fun tonight, oh yeah, oh right
