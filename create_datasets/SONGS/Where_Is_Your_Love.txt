Refrain:
Where is your love
Day and night I'm dreaming of you
And I wish my dream will come true
I need you, whatever I do
Tell me where,
Where is your love
Day and night I'm dreaming of you
And I wish my dream will come true
I need you, whatever I do
Tell me where, where is your love

Refrain B:
Where is your love ( 4x )

Bridge 1:
I - can't believe what you've done to me
Now you're free
How - could I fall for someone like you
So untrue

Bridge 2:
I - feel so lonely again since you're gone
I've been strong
I - thought forever that you would be mine
All the time

Rap 1:
I need you - but maybe it's to late
To turn back the clock, to say I will excuse myself,
I'm here to respect you
Touch you, feel you, that's what I wan't to
You are - my only temptation
One and one is two, I lost the vibration
Nine to nine, there is no sunshine
Without you my life has no colours and no time

Rap 2:
Walking - till the end of the road
For now and forever, I'll share your load
When you're next to me, I felt so strong
Seasons are changing, and now you're gone
Feels long - but it's the right time
Cuts like a knife, inside my mind
This is my sign - the real love of my life
Get out of my heart, I will survive

Rap 3:
You're so special - this is the right word
The more I think, the deeper it hurts
Love - no isolation
Think about togetherness, is my imagination
Temptation, now you're far away
Come back and stay, share my day
Heart's still bleading, mind is outta control
You touched my mind, my body and my soul
