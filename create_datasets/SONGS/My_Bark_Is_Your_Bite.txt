Is there what you're worth?
Or shot in the dark from the corner of the past
You wondered why I lied to you the night you came into my room

One will settle the nerves, or take the edge off 
I've only got so many left to lose, 
I'll pick and choose

My bark is your bite, it cuts like a knife when I lie 
Because, the mind says it's the best thing to do, for you
My mind says it's the best thing to do, for you, 
My mind says it's the best thing to do

Is it what cigarettes do?
Doubt the price of your thoughts in the corner of your skull
And you wondered why I took my time to throw my arms around you

Nobody wants to love, 
To carry the burden or balance the glass 
With each and every move, I'll pick and choose

My bark is your bite, but time after time, I lie 
Because the mind says it's the best thing to do, for you
My mind says it's the best thing to do, for you, 
My mind says it's the best thing to do

My bark is your bite, 
It's like kind of right, 
But I lie because the mind says it's the best thing to do

So I'll take one more chance, I'll dance if you'll dance
I'll try because, the mind says it's the best thing do
My mind says it's the best thing to do, for you
My mind says it's the best thing to do
