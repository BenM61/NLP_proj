Time of your life
Time of you life now
Time of your life
Time of you life now
Time of your life
Time of you life now

Woke up this morning with a head full of snow. Was it a dream.
Picked up me body for the ride of a lifetime is what it seemed.
Hope got me started. Put you to the centre, so it seemed.
Don't you hurry 'cause you'll reach your goals, is what it reads.
Got caught in the rain and it washed all my senses down the drain.
Drop me a line when you're given the time and we'll talk some more.

Woke up this morning with a head full of snow.
Was it a dream? Don't you worry cause you'll reach your goals is what it reads.

This is the time of you life
This is the time of you life now
This is the time of you life
This is the time of you life now

Picked up my mail to the 1040 exit to the streets
Drew some money then shook hands with the angel next to me.
Caught in the rain and it washed all my senses down the drain.
Woke up this morning with a head full of snow. Was it a dream?

This is the time of you life
This is the time of you life now
This is the time of you life
This is the time of you life

This is the time of you life
This is the time of you life now
This is the time of you life
This is the time of you life

This is the time of you life
This is the time of you life now
This is the time of you life
This is the time of you life
