Baltimore

Nobody got in nobody’s way
So I guess you could say it was a good day
At least a little better than the day in Baltimore
Does anybody hear us pray
For Michael Brown or Freddie Gray?
Peace is more than the absence of war

Absence of war
Are we gonna see another bloody day?
We’re tired of the crying and people dying
Let’s take all the guns away

Absence of war, you and me
Maybe we can finally say
Enough is enough, it’s time for love
It’s time to hear
It’s time to hear the guitar play, 
Guitar play

Baltimore
Ever more

If there ain’t no justice, then there ain’t no peace
If there ain’t no justice, then there ain’t no peace
If there ain’t no justice, then there ain’t no peace
If there ain’t no justice, then there ain’t no peace

Baltimore
Baltimore
Peace is, peace is more than the absence of war

Are we gonna see another bloody day? (No, no no no)
We’re tired of the crying and people dying (oh oh)
Let’s take all the guns away

There ain’t no peace
If there ain’t no justice, then there ain’t no peace
If there ain’t no justice, then there ain’t no peace (Baltimore, oh)

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh (Absence of war)
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
We have to interrupt the regular scheduled programming
To bring you up to date on a developing situation in Los Angeles
