Come down here hold my hand
I will always be your friend
And it won't change ever again
Ever
Feel the fire bright and warm
Like the place we grew up on
Down the street fooling around
Doing nothing
All broken down That's how I spend my time
She's delighted could never hide it
It reminds me how well she knows me
Around your neck you wore dice
Keeping the bad things out of our lives
Now you're gone You brought it along
With you
Come down here Keep your smile
When you think of me once in a while
Roll your dice and wind it all back
Forever

Come down here Don't be sad
All the good things come to an end
How nice to be just you and me
Always
I miss you so I can't let go
