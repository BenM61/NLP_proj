I was lost in the dead of night
Then came angels, I put my fight on
All of a sudden, I'm fading
I was blinded, by the light til' you say

Babe, it's okay, it's okay now
Let it out, let it love, let it rain down
Hold me now, hold me down, hold me always
Babe, babe, babe
Now babe, say my name, it's okay now
Say it loud, shout it out, down the hallway
Love me now, love me now, love me always
Babe, babe, babe

There were sirens out to get me
So by now, I swear I've heard it all
I just pray, you choose to catch me
But either way, you're always worth the fall
So I say

Babe, it's okay, it's okay now
Let it out, let it love, let it rain down
Hold me now, hold me down, hold me always
Babe, babe, babe
Now babe, say my name, it's okay now
Say it loud, shout it out, down the hallway
Love me now, love me now, love me always
Babe, babe

Hey, all the things that they say
Love cause the things they choose to hate is just a love 
That they're afraid of
But see, I'm not afraid to take a leap 
Not afraid to get too deep, singing long live the angels
And hey, I take a lot of colors in your dreams 
Things on they're talking they may see
Remember feeling they know way too far
And I say what luck to find you in this life
I've been around so many times
I've never found someone so beautiful

So babe, it's okay, it's okay now
Let it out, let it love, let it rain down
Hold me now, hold me down, hold me always
Babe, babe, babe
Now babe, say my name, it's okay
Shout it out, say it loud, down the hallway
Hold me now, hold me now, hold me always
Babe, babe, babe, now

Babe, say my name, it's okay now
Say it loud, shout it out, down the hallway
Love me now, love me now, love me always
Babe, babe, babe
Now babe, it's okay, it's okay now
Let it out, let it love, let it rain down
Hold me down, hold me now, hold me always
Babe, babe, babe
