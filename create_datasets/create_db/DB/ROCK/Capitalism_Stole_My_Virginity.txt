Nowhere is untouched by shame, who said we could get by with our childhood games
Days of innocence all long gone avoid the shock honey and try to live on
Woke up all paralysed all dreams corrupted in front of our eyes cause on every forehead of every little whore there is a sign that says:
Baby don't come back no more
Distasteful ugly and cheap
This is how you make me feel
Capitalism stole my virginity

Robbed of our bleeding hearts
Smashed our illusions tore them all apart
But now we are unsentimental and unafraid to destroy this culture that we hate
Tired of being nothing when we should be everything
And on every forehead of every little whore there is a sign that says:
Baby we are all born to die
Distasteful ugly and cheap
This is how you make me feel
Capitalism stole my virginity

We are all sluts, cheap products in someone else's notebook
