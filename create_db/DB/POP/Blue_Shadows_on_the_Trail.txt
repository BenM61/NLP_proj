(VM)   Shades of night are falling,
       As the winds begin to sigh,
       And the world is silhouetted 
       'gainst the sky.

(VM&MM)Blue Shadows On The Trail,
       Blue moon shining through the trees,
(VM)   And a plaintive wail from the distance,
       From the distance, coms the evening breeze

(VM)   Move along  (MM) Move along
(VM)   Blue shadows, move along.
(VM&MM)Soon the dawn will come,
       And you'll be on your way.
(VM)   But until the darkness sheds it veil,
(VM&MM)There'll be Blue Shadows On The Trail.

         ORCHESTRA PLAYS WITH MOON MAIDS
                HARMONIZING

(VM&MM) Move along blue shadows (VM)Move along,
  (MM)  Move along, move along, move along.
(VM)    Soon the dawn will come,
        And you'll be on your way.
(MM)    On your way.
(VM&MM) But until the darkness sheds its veil,
 (VM)   There'll be 
(VM&MM) Blue Shadows On The Trail.
        There'll be shadows on the trail.
