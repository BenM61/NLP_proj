In fair Verona where we lay our scene
Juliet is on her knees
She shoots to kill and aims to please, oh

And you can see it in her eyes
It's not something that she likes
But she can't stand being alone
So you thank her for her charm
And you take her in your arms
But she just won't let you go

She said her daddy was an alcoholic
And her mother was an animal
Now she's living like a rolling stone
She said that the law will never take her alive
If they take her home

In Belarus she was a vespertine
She danced the go-go for the bourgeosie
Now she's here and she is on her knees, oh-oh

And she won't apologize
For the cheating and the lies
But she can't stand being this way
And you can see it in her eyes
She would kill them if they try
To send her back to her grave

She said her daddy was an alcoholic
And her mother was an animal
Now she's living like a rolling stone
She said that the law will never take her alive
If they take her home

Rolling stone, rolling stone (she keeps on living like a)
Rolling stone, rolling stone (she keeps on living like a)

She said her daddy was an alcoholic
And her mother was an animal
Now she's living like a rolling stone
She said that the law will never take her alive
If they take her home

They'll never take her alive if they take her home
They'll never take her alive if they take her home
