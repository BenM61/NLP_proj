Let's go back
Listen, power

Let's go back in a day
I'm talking back in a day
Before I used to MC
When D-Power D he was just a DJ
I was in the jungle vibe
Selling records from 9 to 5
I used to go old school
...
And skip a bus right then
I lost a vibe
Then UKG come alive
I'm talking munchie
Talking...
And then came one two three
And then came Wiley then came Dizzy Kano and D Double E
...
And grime is alive
It was hard but we still survived
I know music evolves through time but
I thank you Lord that grime still alive
And I bust the mic
Now I'm on lord of the mic
Now I've linked on with modestep
2012 is a whole next hype

Alright where do I start
Let me come back let me go from the start
My life without music is a thorn in the heart
This marriage could have end in the park
It's like taking tea from a shop
English way Jamaican herry
The rivals listening to Morgan Harage
UKJ hard ass crew
Beating of the drums
LIstening to ABBA
I knew like when it was like Jacobs
...
Bob Marley, Gwen Steffani James Brunt
For you they may hardly relate
But for me they're all in the same playground
And it all comes together like a rain and cold weather
This is my Darwin Theory
Not like humans and apes
It's more like ...
Then you got dubstep
Then party like a rockstar
A rockstar
Yeah, yeah

For as long as I remember
I've always had music on my agenda
Yes! Number one contender
Yes! Lyrical skunk never heard of my scent
I used to listen to Call Fm!
Black market...
Couple a years later
Lyrical sniper
I was a raver
Me and my man got briefing everywhere
Goin' on horrid
Heartless bears we are so solid
To be a MC ouh it was so funny
After years and determination
I'm part of a world known organization
Undefeated no other teaming
...
And no formation
Me and my mate is a Jesus
I was broke
Everybody loved me
Get paid up
...
I'm sick understatement
Me and your mate work in a basement
I used to have one pair of nikes
Now I've got countless trainers

Been doing this thing since TDK
Now it's all like top cd Djs
The way that I know that's PBK
Hardless fun I bust your mind
That man there was leaving away
...
That's what I was back in the day
But I still represent the sounds of the UK
Little bit of dubstep little bit of grime
...
Be my
Doing this for awesome crew
One for the a track and dynamite boo
I don't wanna tell them what to do
They'll deal with a nasty crew
Park your crew
Dj is your passing through
