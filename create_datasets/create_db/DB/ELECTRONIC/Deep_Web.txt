Both ends of my candle countin' paces
Never stop chasin' each other's faces
I'm the mask that separates them
Bridge their sole desires cravin'
Don't make me take my face off
Show you why I hate soft
Let flock of sheep get shaved off
Lynched by their halos

Call me crazy but I swear my line's been tapped
In my glass house prepared for surprise attack
Realized I held the blade inside my back
Omega megalomaniac
In my glass house prepared for surprise attack
Realized I held the blade inside my back

I'm the coat hanger in your man's vagina
Manic downstroke on fire
Beat it bitch' all black can't fade it
Beat it bitch' I came ta brang it
F*ck bourgeois ODB raw
Your pearl white teeth my Yellowman jaw
Say only what you think I know you should
Hate myself more than you ever could

Call me crazy but I swear my line's been tapped
In my glass house prepared for surprise attack
Realized I held the blade inside my back
Omega megalomaniac
In my glass house prepared for surprise attack
Realized I held the blade inside my back
