We'll gather, race off and fight the elder
The consequence of what's in the net
A prophecy done info pouring
Forces left to face humanity

We travel seek weapons in the mountains
We're lucky lady luck made our minds
The sacrifice we must adhere to
The only hope for future stakes too high

Like a martyr sacrifice

Long wait, the days are clouding
With mother sharing in the pain
Erase the human memory
They know not of were they came
And though their hearts are broken
We have to wipe the tears away
In vein they did not suffer
Ten thousand strong will seize the day

We'll be possessed and fight disaster
Don't like the statements of the augustest
Turn in the god seeds of creation
Stakes so high, we must never relent

We lie awake and your mites are clouded
Initiation of the master plan
We'll celebrate, build a life of pardon
Centuries will pass, pations will win

We are the fate of man.

Long wait, the days are clouding
With mother sharing in the pain
Erase the human memory
They know not of were they came
And though their hearts are broken
We have to wipe the tears away
In vein they did not suffer
Ten thousand strong will seize the day

Long wait, the days are clouding
With mother sharing in the pain
Erase the human memory
They know not of were they came
And though our hearts are broken
We have to wipe the tears away
In vein they did not suffer
Ten thousand strong will seize the day

Long wait, the days are clouding
(mother's crying out in pain)
With mother sharing in the pain
Erase the human memory
They know not of were they came
(we have to wipe the tears away)
And though their hearts are broken
We have to wipe the tears away
In vein they did not suffer
Ten thousand strong will seize the day
