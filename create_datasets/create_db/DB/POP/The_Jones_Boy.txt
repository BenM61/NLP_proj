The whole town's talking about the Jones Boy
The Jones Boy
The Jones Boy
The whole town's talking about the Jones Boy
He acts mighty peculiar now

The whole town's saying he was a good boy
a nice boy
a swell boy
The whole town's saying he's not a well boy
He just isn't the same somehow

he hops
he jumps
so merrily over the water pumps
he stops and then
he comes to a pump and he'll jump again

the buzz is over the fences
that he's going out of his senses

The whole town's talking about the Jones boy
the poor boy
the Jones boy

But I just happen to be the Jones boy
and I happen to be in love
