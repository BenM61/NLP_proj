In my mother's belly and I'm startking to kick
Nine months in the womb and I'm making her sick
Squeeze through the womb and I land in the room

Don't know who we are can't really tell
We do the council flats and we do some jail

We don't like school, in a week we go once
Don't like the police, 'cos they kick and they punch
God bless what a stress and the stress comes at once
But remember, boy, you're a superstar

(Can't take it)
Can't break it, can't take who you are
(Can't take it)
Can't break it, can't take who you are
(Can't take it)
So remember, boy, you're a superstar

They call you council estate, they call you "can't go straight"
They call you crime rate, they call you "can't go straight"
And you're bending all the rules, where you bury your tools
Bending all the rules, where you bury your tools

Your family can't visit, cause the prison's too far
You can't be who you be, cause you're not who you are
Remember, boy, you're a superstar
Remember, boy, you're a superstar
So remember, boy, you're a superstar

(Can't take it)
Can't break it, can't take who you are
(Can't take it)
Can't break it, can't take who you are
(Can't take it)
So remember, boy, you're a superstar

S, s, superstar
(Can't take it)
You know who you are
(Can't take it)
S, s, superstar
(Can't take it)
You know who are you
(Can't take it)
You're a superstar
Can't break it
So remember, boy, you're a superstar

(Can't take it)
Can't break it, can't take who you are
(Can't take it)
Can't break it, can't take who you are
(Can't take it)
So remember, boy, you're a superstar
