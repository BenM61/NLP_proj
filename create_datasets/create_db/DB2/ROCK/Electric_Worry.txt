Well, you made me weep and you made me moan
When you caused me to leave, child, my happy home
But someday, baby
You ain't worry my life anymore

I get satisfaction
Everywhere I go
Where I lay my head
That's where I call home
Where the barren pines
On the mission stare
Take tomorrow's collar
And give 'em back the glare

Bang, bang, bang, bang
Vamanos, vamanos
Bang, bang, bang
Vamanos, vamanos

You told everybody in the neighborhood
What a dirty mistreater, that I was no good
But someday, baby
You ain't worry my life anymore

Doctor or lawyer
I'll never be
Life of a drifter
The only life for me
You can have your riches
All the gold you saved
There ain't room for one thing
In everybody's grave

Bang, bang, bang, bang
Vamanos, vamanos
Bang, bang, bang
Vamanos, vamanos, come on!

If I had money, like Henry Ford
Lord, I'd have me a woman, yeah, on every road
But someday, baby
You ain't worry my life any more

Invocation of the dummies
Requiem for a head
Cash in at the corner
Piles of street cred
I get satisfaction
Everywhere I go
One day baby
You'll worry me no more

Bang, bang, bang, bang
Vamanos, vamanos
Bang, bang, bang
Vamanos, vamanos, yeah!
