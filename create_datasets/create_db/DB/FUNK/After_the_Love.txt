There's something about your touch, 
holding me so tight 
tall like a mountain and strong 
you could do no wrong

Well, hot kisses reaching for skin 
I kept trembling inside 
heart big as an ocean and calm 
I need to dive in

After the love, after the doo be doo be doo 
after the love then we start again

There's something about your walk 
watching you feels right 
soft lips caressing my soul 
I want to have it all

Is this all just make believe 
fun and games at night 
hot kisses reaching for skin 
I don't want this to end

After the love, after the doo be doo be doo 
after the love then we start again

When I look at you you are the one I've dreamt of 
and you can do to me things I'd never 
dared do before 
when I look at you you're the one I lust for 
and you can do to me things I'd never dared 
do before
