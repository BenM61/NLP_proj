Time can pass so slowly when you feel so all alone
Love can strike like lightning when you find your heart a home
I've see it in the movies read about it in a book
I never thought I'd feel it but your touch was all it took

Take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart
Baby you're the first to take it
I love you more than I should
But it keeps me feelin' so good
I've waited for your love forever
You're the one to take good care of my heart

Come and make your magic 'till you have me hypnotized
If we get any closer I'll be drowning in your eyes
You're the one I needed most when my love was on the line
I'm so glad you gave me yours when I gave you mine

So take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart
Baby you're the first to take it
You're the only one who could break it
I love you more than I should
But it keeps me feelin' so good
I've waited for your love forever
You're the one to take good care of my heart
