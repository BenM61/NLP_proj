Its shape tells us plainly
Time inside is curved
It holds Elvis Presley's body
Perfectly preserved

When Kennedy came with Monroe
Late in '55
The senator carved their names
By the overdrive
It's an accident of nature
Designed by architects
NASA built it from an alloy
They'd stolen from the Czechs

The Beast Box is dreaming
What you believe

The replica at Disneyland
In the big exhibition hall
It's correct to the last nut and bolt
It's nothing like it at all
If a pregnant woman touches it
The child will be shy
And if you glimpse it once
You eventually die

The Beast Box is dreaming
What you believe

In a dream I'm inside
With my kid brother
There's scenes of awful suffering
We're avoiding looking at each other
Then he's pointing to the handrail
It's long, of burnished chrome
Saying in that stupid voice of his
