Bombay seems lost in dreams
When the pipes let off steam
In a backroom, somewhere, anywhere in L.A.

Next payday comes, I'll be gone
By boats and planes, it's pre-arranged
You can't catch me, I'm on my way back to Bombay

Bombay, Bombay, Bombay, Bombay
Ain't gonna leave no trace
Gonna wash away my face
In the Bombay river
I'm gonna settle
I'm gonna stay in Bombay

I'm gonna trade my past
For a new life at last
Sit back and have another blast
If I die, Kamasutra's the reason why
Kama, kama, kama, kamasutra,
Kama, kama, I surrender

Bombay, Bombay, Bombay, Bombay
Ain't gonna leave no trace
Gonna wash away my face
In the Bombay river
I'm gonna settle
I'm gonna stay in Bombay

Bombay, Bombay...
