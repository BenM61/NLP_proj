Yo Pierre, you wanna come out here?

In New York I Milly Rock, hide it in my sock
Running from an opp, then I shoot at opp
And I'm on the block, and I'm on the block
In New York I Milly Rock, hide it in my sock
Hide it in my sock, selling that rerock

In New York I Milly Rock, hide it in my sock
Used to sell rerock, running from the cops
Shooting at the opps
Yo, Pierre you wanna come out here?
