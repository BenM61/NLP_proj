You're everywhere and nowhere baby, that's where you're at
Going down a bumpy hillside, in your hippy hat
Flying across the country, and getting fat
Saying everything is groovy, when your tires are flat

And it's high ho silver lining, anywhere you go now baby
I see your sun is shining
But I won't make a fuss, though it's obvious

Flies are in your pea soup baby, they're waving at me
Anything you want is yours now, only nothing's for free
Lies are gonna get you someday, just wait and see
So open up your beach umbrella, while you're watching TV

And it's high ho silver lining, anywhere you go now baby
I see your sun is shining
But I won't make a fuss, though it's obvious

And it's high ho silver lining, anywhere you go now baby
I see your sun is shining
But I won't make a fuss, though it's obvious

And it's high ho silver lining, anywhere you go now baby
I see your sun is shining
But I won't make a fuss, though it's obvious

And it's high ho silver lining, anywhere you go now baby
I see your sun is shining
But I won't make a fuss, though it's obvious
