Looking through the window can you tell me what you see.
You're sure you're really seeing what is meant to be a Glass
a mirror to reflect what I conspire a vision, image I desire.

Standing on the ice believing all I'm searching for
Close your cloudy eyes and chase all that you did before
Standing on the ice believing all I'm for
Close your cloudy eyes and chase all that you did before

Living in a glass house shielding all that's meant for me
Can you clear the shade and can you tell me what you see.

Shadow fills the light until the glass house becomes the night
Dark is gleaming or am I dreaming

Running everywhere
Seeing clearly when I dare
Is it today or is it your way

And the moon must fall
Inspiration waits for your call for you to get a silhouette

Narrow the field aim in any direction
Do what I feel just to see my reflection

Any turn I know
Disappearing everywhere I go
I look to you for what I do

And only then I see
That the glass house is just for me
And any time is never mine

Narrow the field aim in any direction
Do what I feel just to see my reflection

Shadow fills the light until the glass house becomes night
Dark is gleaming or am I dreaming

Running everywhere
Seeing clearly when I dare
Is it today or is it your way

And the moon must fall
Inspiration waits for your call for you to get a silhouette.
