A fragile peace that exists inside
A frame so shallow, so narrow-minded.
An open wound - we run inside.
A raging turmoil.
Helplessness confides...

Cursed to crawl
for pale and bleeding heart
Cursed to crawl
Pale and bleeding.
Cursed to crawl
for pale and bleeding heart
Cursed to crawl
PAle and bleeding.

Enter this sphere,
commonplace, borderline.
Between my rage,
Between my hate.
Damn our mistakes.
Fixation blinds.
The pain of knowing
the truth beyond...

Cursed to crawl
for pale and bleeding heart
Cursed to crawl
Pale and bleeding.
Cursed to crawl
for pale and bleeding heart
Cursed to crawl
PAle and bleeding.
Unprepared.
A gruesome display,
perhaps a replay -
self-inflicted.
Reduced to nothing,
my piece of mind seduced.
Unworthiness.
The scars never heal...

Cursed to crawl
for pale and bleeding heart
Cursed to crawl
Pale and bleeding.
Cursed to crawl
for pale and bleeding heart
Cursed to crawl
PAle and bleeding.
