Oh summer, not a bit of breeze
Neon signs are shining through the tired trees
Lovers walking to and fro
Everyone has someone and a place to go

Listen, hear the cars come, pass
They don't even see me flying by so fast
They're moving, going who knows where
Only thing I know is I am not going there

Where do you go
When you feel that your brain is on fire
Where do you go
When you don't even know what it is you desire

Listen, laughter everywhere
Hear it, life is in the air
As the night comes and the town awakes
Sound of children calling
And the squeal of brakes

Music but a lonely song
When you can't help wondering
Where do I belong
When you can't help wondering
Where do I belong
