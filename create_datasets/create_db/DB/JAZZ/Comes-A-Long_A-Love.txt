Comes along a love suddenly
Brother are you happy and excited
Comes along a love suddenly
Everywhere you go you feel invited
Comes along a love suddenly
Every dream you have becomes ignited
You just begin to live
Comes along love

Comes along a love suddenly
Though you never sang you're always singing
Comes along a love suddenly
Chimes you never heard begin a-ringing
Comes along a love suddenly
Night and day you're heart is highland flinging
You live and you love
Comes along love

I don't care how
Blue you're feeling now
You sparkle and you bubble
See each bluebird double

Comes along a love suddenly
Petty little things no longer phase you
Comes along a love suddenly
Everyone around you seems to praise you
Comes along a love suddenly
You discover things that just amaze you
You just begin to live
Comes along love

I don't care how
Blue you're feeling now
You sparkle yes you bubble
Look out you gotta whole lotta trouble

Comes along a love suddenly
Petty little things no longer phase you
Comes along a love suddenly
Everyone around you seems to praise you
Comes along a love suddenly
You discover things that just amaze you
You just begin to live
And really love
The day you live
Oh well you sparkle
You bubble
Well you're in trouble
Coz mister
You're really in love
