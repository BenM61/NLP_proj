I don't f*ck with broke niggas, nah we can't relate
I put water on that white, bitch I call her Ricki Lake
Lil mama she lost in the sauce, she needa get hit with the pause
After I f*ck her she run through the doors
And then I'm rejecting her calls
I threw a pack over the gate to my niggas hiding in the wall
RIP Pistol, RIP Mike, I pour up the lean for y'all
Remember the days I trapped out the bando
