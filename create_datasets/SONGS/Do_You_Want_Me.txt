Do you want me?
Do you really want me?
Do you really want me?

You came in and I were wandering around,
Just to see your beautiful face,
The stars and the moon shining in your eyes,
Could not believe that you wanted me.

A little kiss, and I thought I could die,
I was standing so close to you,
My heart beated faster as I started to say,
In other words, baby, you are all I need.

I can't understand that you are here,
Do you want me?
I just can't believe that you are in.
Do you really want me?
I can't understand that you are mine.
Do you want me?
I just can't believe that you're so fine.
Do you really want me?

Every time, when I see you around,
Don't understand how you make up your mind,
You choose every god, every girl that you like,
You would have been the angel for me.

But now I see that your heart is so pure,
Must be good, to good to be true,
My heart beated faster as I started to say,
In other words, baby, you are all I need.

I can't understand that you are here,
Do you want me?
I just can't believe that you are in.
Do you really want me?
I can't understand that you are mine.
Do you want me?
I just can't believe that you're so fine.
Do you really want me?

Do you want me?
Do you want me?
Do you want me?

Take my hand,
Look in my eyes,
Take your time, and make me want to fly.
I think I love you, do do do you want me?

Do you want me?
Do you want me?
Do you want me?
Do you really want me?

I can't understand that you are mine.
Do you want me?
I just can't believe that you're so fine.
Do you really want me?
