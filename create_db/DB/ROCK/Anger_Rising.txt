Alabama trailer park they call home 
Boy standing at attention in the corner his own 
Terrified, scorpion crawling the wall 
By the way father, could you please beat me some more? 

Anger rising up inside him yet again 
Tell me you got a plan 
Deaf and blind I'm living with the lepers and 
You want to hold my hand 

Cold Alaska, hiding, bundled up tight 
Stretch aluminum foil 'cross the window at night 
Mother crying, calling out up the stairs 
By the way father, do you even care that I'm scared? 

Chorus 

Repeat chorus with "Devil rising up inside him yet again" 

Generation three, solitary, alone 
By the way father, created hell on my own 

Chorus
