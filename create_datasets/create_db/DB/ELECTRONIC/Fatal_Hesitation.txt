The cafes are all deserted, the streets are wet again
There's nothing quite like an out of season holiday town in the rain
When the tourists go and the cold winds blow
And my girl is on a plane, home

I'm never going to love another, the way that I have loved you
It's taken me a little time to discover it
Now I know it's true, but fatal hesitation
Made me miss the show

Oh Romeo is standing in the rain
And I know that I have let her slip away
(Fatal hesitation aah, fatal hesitation aah)

I saw you again this morning, walking down the beach
And though you are a thousand miles away
You were only just out of reach, but when I got up close
And I saw her face, I knew it couldn't be so, no, no

Oh Romeo is standing in the rain
And I, yes I know, I have let her slip away
(Fatal hesitation aah, fatal hesitation aah)
I'm going to get on my boat and sail away

Oh Romeo is standing in the rain
And I, yes I know, I have let her slip away
Fatal hesitation aah
Fatal hesitation aah
Fatal hesitation aah
Fatal hesitation aah

I'm going to read a little Shakespeare
And get her out of my head
It doesn't matter any more

I'm going to miss her just a little bit
Just a little bit
