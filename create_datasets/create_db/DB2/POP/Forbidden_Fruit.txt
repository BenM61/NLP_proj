I have never seen a freak
As wonderful as you
It's strange but it's true
Forbidden fruit you are to me

Pluck you from your tree
Can't you see my situation?
I can't answer questions

Do you know what I saw today?
A man blow himself away over you
But I get around
Some people like to call that a man

But I'm so ashamed
I've got to get together
Got to make an effort to change

I have never seen a girl
As beautiful as you
Well, that's not exactly true
Only yesterday

Do you know what I say that day?
A boy blow himself away over you
But I get around
Some people like to call that a man

But I'm so ashamed
And I've got to get together
Got to make an effort to change

Do you know what I saw today?
A man blow himself away over you
