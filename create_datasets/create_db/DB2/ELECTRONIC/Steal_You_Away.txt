Like a thief in the night I take you far from here
There will be no need to worry when I'm near
If there is a doubt in your mind I will make you see
That if you could put your trust in me

I would steal you away if I could 
I'd turn the night to day
If I could steal you away I would
And I will steal you away

I would steal you away if I could
And I will steal you away

I would steal you away if I could 
I'd turn the night to day
If I could steal you away I would
And I will steal you away
