Blue Monday, how I hate blue Monday 
Got me workin' like a dog all day 
Here comes Tuesday, oh hard Tuesday 
I'm so tired, I've got no time to play 
Look out Wednesday I'm beat to my bone 
My girl calls, I gotta tell her I'm not home 
She knows Thursday is a hard workin day 
Til Friday I get paid 
Oh Saturday morning, Saturday morning 
All my tired has gone away 
Got my money and my honey 
And we're out on the town to play 
Sunday morning my head is bad 
But it's worth it, all the times I had 
But I've still got to get my rest 
For Monday is a mess Saturday morning, 
Oh Satirday morning 
All my tired has gone away 
Me and my honey, we got some money 
And were out on the town play 
Sunday morning my head is bad 
But it's worth all the times I had 
But I've got to go and get some rest 
For Monday is a mess!
