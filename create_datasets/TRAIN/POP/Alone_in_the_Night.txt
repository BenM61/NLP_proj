Intro
Slowly time is passing somehow I get bye
Keeping myself busy
Is my sole occupation
I don't know
What I'm doing
But it fills my mind
Putting off the moment
When I can't escape you baby.
Alone in the night
Me and the memory
Somebody set me free
From someone who used to be.
A part of my night
Woman please let me go
You said godbye
Now here I lie
Alone in the night.
It's lucky I got lovin' friends who come around
Eatin' drinkin' talkin'
About anything out you love
Late night shows in T. V.
When they've all gone home
And then I gotta face it I am dyin' for you baby.
Alone in the Night ...
Lonely days are bad enough but come the night
My heart and I can't fight it
We remember come back we surrender.
Alone in the night
Woman please let me go you said goodbye
Now here I lied alone in the night.
Alone in the Night ...
