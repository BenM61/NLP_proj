Well it's a hustle, it's a hustle every day of life, 
And it's enough to keep your head above the water, see.
It seems the older I get the more freedom I have, 
But everything is complicated to me.

Responsibility's parkin?,
Take the stress, oh my god, get off my back before I snap and break.
Know I gots to elevate. Rob my fate. 
Take it to the highest when I'm rhymin'
On the city streets, the rhythms in my freaky sneaks, sneaky freaks, 

Stoppin by the diner 
To recharge my cells. 
Get with the breads, and have a cup of laughs. 
Take a long drive, cause I'm still alive,
And if the pressure didn't get me then, won't get me now.
Stay high as the sky and bust the f*ck out.

cause playin' is a hustle, 
Runnin' is a hustle.
Everything's a hustle but love.
Livin' is a hustle when you're workin' every muscle, 
And you're just tryin to keep you head up.
Keep your head up, ohh.

Hah.
Dig.
The music is the thing that always made me high.
And it's the one thing left in life that never told no lies, 
And it's the feeling in my heart 
And the tear in my eye 
And the chill in my spine 
And the freedom on my mind.
And it's the more love that I gave you know it gave me back. 
And if ya ever borrowed something then I paid it back.
But if I ever did you wrong, then forgive me, 
But please don't put no evil on me
Cause I'm just another brother from a father and mother 
Trying to make my way in the world, ya see.

Livin' is a hustle, playin' is a hustle.
Everything's a hustle but love.
Livin' is a hustle when you're workin' every muscle, and you're just tryin' to keep your head up.
Keep your head up, ohh.
