When I hear that serenade in blue
I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know, many moons ago.

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory, serenade in blue
It seems like only yesterday, the small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away, I hear you say forever more

And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
But you remained in my heart, so
Tell me darling is there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark, serenade in blue.
