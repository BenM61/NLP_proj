Who's the loving daddy with the beautiful eyes
What a pair o' shoes, I'd like to try 'em for size
I'll just tell him, "Baby, won't you swing it with me"
Hope he tells me maybe, what a wing it will be
So, I said politely "Darling may I intrude"
He said "Don't keep me waiting when I'm in the mood"

First I held him lightly and we started to dance
Then I held him tightly what a dreamy romance
And I said "Hey, baby, it's a quarter to three
There's a mess of moonlight, won't you share it with me"
"Well" he answered "Baby, don't you know that it's rude
To keep my two lips waiting when they're in the mood"

In the mood, that's what he told me
In the mood, and when he told me
In the mood, my heart was skipping
It didn't take me long to say "I'm in the mood now"

In the mood for all his kissing
In the mood his crazy loving
In the mood what I was missing
It didn't take me long to say "I'm in the mood now"

So, I said politely "Darling may I intrude"
He said "Don't keep me waiting when I'm in the mood"

"Well" he answered "Baby, don't you know that it's rude
To keep my two lips waiting when they're in the mood"
