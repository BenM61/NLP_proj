A man is placed upon the steps, a baby cries
And high above him you hear the church bells start to ring.
The heaviness, the heaviness of it settles in,
A mother starts to sing.

Then it's one foot then the other as you step along the road
Steppin' on the road, how much weight, how much weight?
And it's how long and how far and how many times,
Oh, before it's too late?

Calling all angels, calling all angels.
Walk me through this one, don't leave me alone.
Calling all angels, calling all angels.
We're trying, we're hoping, but we're not sure how

Oh and every day you gaze upon the sunset
With such love and intensity.
Why it's almost as if, if you could only crack the code
You'd finally understand what this all means.

Oh but if you could, do you think you would
Have traded all the pain and suffering?
Oh, but then you would've missed the beauty of the light upon this earth
And the sweetness of the leaving.

Calling all angels, calling all angels!
Walk me through this one, don't leave me alone
Calling all angels, calling all angels,
We're trying, we're hoping but we're not sure

Calling all angels (call all angels)
Calling all angels (call all angels)
Walk me through this one
Don't leave me alone.

Calling all angels, calling all angels
We're trying, we're hoping, we're hurting, we're loving
We're crying, we're calling,
But we're not sure how this goes.
