Maybe it's much too early in the game
Oh, but I thought I'd ask you just the same
What are you doing New Year's
New Year's Eve?

Wonder whose arms are holding you so tight
When it's exactly twelve o'clock at night
Welcoming in the New Year
New Year's Eve

Maybe I'm crazy to suppose
I'd ever be the one you chose
Out of a thousand invitations
You received

Well, but just in case I stand one little chance
Here comes the jackpot question in advance
