The lights are spinnin'
I gotta get myself up off the floor
My head is ringin'
Bet they think I can't take too much more
The crowd is howlin'
Like the ocean's pounding roar
My legs are goin' out
Someone up there don't like me 

Now my right and my left will decide
'Cause they're done with this bum takin' dives
Now my eyes may be swollen with right hooks and tears
But I see salvation tonight
In a left and a right 

Called me a kid, champ or lefty
A bowery kid to the core
Fast cars and hipster movie stars
I ain't got none of that anymore
Now I'm down in the seventh
In the eighth my ribs are sore 
In the ninth I'm staggerin'
Someone up there don't like me 

It's a one-way ticket
Smart money's showin' me the door
Backed on the ropes now
Someone up there don't like me anymore
When the crowd goes silent
One thing that I know for sure
Knock me down one time
I'll be comin' back for more
