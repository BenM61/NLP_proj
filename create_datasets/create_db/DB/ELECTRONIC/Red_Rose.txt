Little girl, do you know what you are, do you know 
This baby's gonna be a star, do you know 
A teenangel empress from hollywood highs 
With wonderful eyes 

Your beautiful, put on your stratoblue suit 
I know that your in the mood to fly 
We got the power to make it come true 
The most exciting news 

We'll be together till the end of time 
And when you smile, red rose, it's just like blue sunshine 
Oh, we're ascending and we'll never die 
Cause when we kiss, red rose, we're changing six to nine 
It's revolution time 

When six turns into nine
Move over, closer to my fantasies, pretty baby 
We're standing at the turn of the centuries 
The daughter of time is dancing tonite 
Little dreamer, you're the D.J. Of your soul 
C'mon, lets swing to that rock and roll 

The sweetest arrows of desire will set this dance on fire 
Above the city of the million moons 
We'll reach the palace of the sun 
Do what you will shall be our destiny 
We will unfold the secrets of the new jerusalem
