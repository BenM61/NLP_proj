Aah yeah
Ha, I wanna take you back just like this
Yeah here were go
Come on, Come on
(Just a touch of love a little bit)
Yeah
(Just a touch of love)
Come on, Come on
(Just a touch of love a little bit)
Yeah
(Just a touch of love)
Makes me shine just a little bit, just a little bit
(with just a touch of love)
In my mind baby just a little bit, just a little bit
(you got to)
Keep me high baby just a little bit, just a little bit
(with just a touch of love)
Can we spend some time
(can we spend some time)
Oooh baby baby
Just a touch of love a little bit
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love a little bit
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of your love all the time to my mind
(Yeah girl)
Just enough of your love to my mind keeps me high
(One touch of love)
Just a touch of your love all the time to my mind
(I never let you go)
Just enough of your love to my mind keeps me high
Just a touch of love a little bit
(Hmmm baby)
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love a little bit
(Hmmm baby)
Just a touch of love
Need it now just a little bit, just a little bit
(with just a touch of love)
Makes me down baby just a little bit, just a little bit
(you got to)
Send fire through my spine just a little bit, just a little bit
(with just a touch of love)
Can we spend some time
(can we spend some time)
Just a touch of love a little bit
(Hmmm baby)
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of your love all the time to my mind
(Yeah girl)
Just enough of your love to my mind keeps me high
Just a touch of your love all the time to my mind
(One touch of love)
Just enough of your love to my mind keeps me high
(I'll never let you go)
Just a touch of love a little bit
(Oooh baby hmmm)
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love a little bit
(Ohh just a touch)
Just a touch of love
Makes me shine just a little bit, just a little bit
(with just a touch of love)
In my mind baby just a little bit, just a little bit
(you got to)
Keep me high just a little bit, just a little bit
(with just a touch of love)
Can we spend some time
(can we spend some time)
Just a touch of your love all the time to my mind
(Yeah baby)
Just enough of your love to my mind keeps me high
Just a touch of your love all the time to my mind
Just enough of your love to my mind keeps me high
(I'll never let you go)
Ad lib to fade
