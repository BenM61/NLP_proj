Don't kill your television yet
Have another cigarette
In your imagination
Tiger tiger burning bright

Take back the airwaves of the night
In your imagination
The world is young Your soul is free
Don't be afraid of the TV

In your imagination
Making love with holograms
Swallowing a million grams 
Of your imagination

Television television
Televisionary television
Activate your love spells
Synchronize and reverse your hells

Agitate your alligator brains
Rip into the heart of the pain
In your televisionary dreams
Your imagination's always free

To turn the spirit of the television inside out
This is what it is all about
Love song for my little terrorist
The way you look at me is like a deathly kiss

Every time I see myself in you
I remember why I created you
Relax Be brave 
Take back the airwaves

Television is the light of our lives
Television is the light and the law and the love of our lives
Love song for my little monster child
You look just like me

You've got my eyes and smile
Like flying saucers or Jesus Christ
You bring out the best in me
You make me pay the price

Relax be brave
Take back the airwaves
Television is the light of our lives
Television is the light and the law and the love of our lives

Television is the light of our lives
And we will heal it of all of its lies
