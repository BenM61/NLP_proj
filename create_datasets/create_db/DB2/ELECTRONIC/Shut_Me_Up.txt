The bass
The rock
The mic
The treble

I like my coffee black
Just like my metal
With the bass
The rock

The mic
The treble
I like my coffee black
Just like my metal

I can't wait for you to f*ck me up
In a minute - minute
In a fuckin' minute
I can't wait for you to f*ck me up

In a minute - minute
In a second

I can't wait for you to shut me up
And make me hip like badass
I can't wait for you to shut me up
Shut it up

I can't wait for you to shut me up
And make me hip like badass
I can't wait for you to shut me up
Shut it up
