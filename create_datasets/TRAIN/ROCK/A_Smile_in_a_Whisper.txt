Sky of ink and diamond stars
Empty streets of just occasional cars
Here we lie in a lullaby
Of the stillness in our room

Words are unable to speak of love
like a smile in a whisper does
Words are unable to speak of love
like a smile in a whisper does

All of the letters in all of the words
In all of the books all over the world
They're nothing but sounds and vowels and nouns
For talking to strangers, that's all they were

Words are unable to speak of love
like a smile in a whisper does
Words are unable to speak of love
like a smile in a whisper does

Orchestra of tiny hearts
It's like pepper sprinkled on our hearts
We're threading a needle with boxing gloves
When we try and talk about love

Words are unable to speak of love
like a smile in a whisper does
Words are unable to speak of love
like a smile in a whisper does
