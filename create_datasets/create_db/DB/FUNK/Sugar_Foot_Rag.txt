Well, I'm gonna get out my sycamore and shine up my shoes
Meet my baby and tell her the news
I bet my bundle on a swayback nag
And I came home winner with a plenty o'swag

One foot, two foot slew foot drag
Swing your honey to the sugar foot rag
Do a little jig and a zig and a zag
And listen to the fiddles as they play that sugar foot rag

Well, I got a big jug o'cinder and a bottle of wine
One's for my honey and the other is mine
Sip on the cider and sip on the wine
They both sip together and a have a good time

One foot, two foot slew foot drag
Swing your honey to the sugar foot rag
Do a little jig and a zig and a zag
And listen to the steel guitar as they play that sugar foot rag

I'm gonna spend all my money and a git on a jag
Swing my honey to the sugar foot rag
Walk right up and stomp on the floor
And swing up the middle with a shoofly four

One foot, two foot slew foot drag
Swing your honey to the sugar foot rag
Do a little jig and a zig and a zag
And listen to Jerry, he's gonna play you that sugar foot rag

Do a little jig and a zig and a zag
And that's the way you play that sugar foot rag
