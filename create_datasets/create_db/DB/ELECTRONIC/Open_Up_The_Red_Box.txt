Why don't you look at the price I'm paying?
Walk in, take a look inside
I've moved back the tables and chairs to the wall
The valuable things I've had to hide

Open up the red box
Come on, open it up
Open up the red box
Come on, open it up

Peer in, looking for that crasher again
You ruined Terry's party last night
An overweight greasy little man with a mouth
That opens more than now and again

Open up the red box
Come on, open it up
Open up the red box
Come on, open it up

Something good must have happened to you
If you would let it happen to you
If you could let it happen to you
Something good would have happened

Lopez, I hate you for the state you're in
Lopez, your hair, it washes out, it washes in
You mopey little fat boy, Lopez
Come on get lost

Open up the red box
Come on, open it up
Open up the red box
Come on, open it up

Something good must have happened to you
If you would let it happen to you
If you could let it happen to you
Something good would have happened

Something good must have happened to you
If you would let it happen to you
If you could let it happen to you
Something good would have happened

I'm out of my head
I'm out of my head
I'm out of my head
I'm out of my head
I'm out of my head
