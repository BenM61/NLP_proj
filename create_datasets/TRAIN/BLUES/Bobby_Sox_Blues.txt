Bobby Sox, baby, I've got to let you go
Bobby Sox, baby, I've got to let you go
You've got a head full of nothin'
But stage, screen and radio

You chase autographs every night
You write fan mail through the day
You keep your great big head in the scrapbook
Yes, and you throw the cookbook away

Bobby Sox, baby, I've got to let you go
You've got a head full of nothin'
But stage, screen and radio

Now you treat me like a stranger
You don't have a word to say
I ask you if you love me
You say, "What would Frankie say?"

Yes, Bobby Sox, baby, I've got to let you go
You've got a head full of nothin'
But stage, screen and radio
