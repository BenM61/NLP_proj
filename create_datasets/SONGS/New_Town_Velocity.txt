Left home a mystery
Leave school for poetry
I say goodbye to them & me
Mission velocity
It made me just run faster now
I'm gonna take it all
Drive around
Make up my mind
With the windows down

I'm in something alright I know
I got to live it out uh-oh
I can't resist
Net force zero oh no
It turned out like I said it would
Can I get the world right here?

Step out to symphonies 
They play on for you and me
When we faced that July down
In uniforms
One and one, no wrong
We chased that summer down

I'm in something alright I know
I got to live it out uh-oh
I can't resist
Net force zero oh no
It turned out like I said it would
Can I get the world right here?

I can't resist 
Net force zero oh no
It turned out like I said it would
Can I get the world right here?

Hello you mystery
Mission velocity
Here comes our poetry
New town velocity
