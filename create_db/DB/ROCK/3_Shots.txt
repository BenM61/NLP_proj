Oh this city
What's it doing to me
You hear something different everyday
There was a little one
He got caught in the sun
Surveys about guns on channel one
Everyone knows
That three shots on the boulevard
And who will be the next one that they name
Oh if nobody cares
I guess we're all gonna hear the story
And who will be the next one that they name

Oh little one
You got bullied at school
Those warning signs of constant cruel
It's everywhere
it's not rich or poor
It's not black or white, it's a revolving door

And everyone knows
That three shots on the boulevard
And who will be the next one that they name
Oh if nobody cares
I guess we're all gonna hear the story
And who will be the next one that they name

Oh, and everyone knows
That three shots on the boulevard
And who will be the next one that they name
Oh and if nobody cares
I guess we're all gonna hear the story
And who will be the next one that they name
Oh, and everyone knows
That three shots on your boulevard
And who will be the next one that they name
