Been doin' a lot of hidin'
Tryin' to get away from myself ? granny say
How you gonna live come tomorrow
Roll black water roll
Roll black water roll
I left home for the good life
But man I felt alone ? daddy say
How you gonna live if you don't know which way up or down is
Roll black water roll
Roll black water roll
I woke up in a city
And I ain't know which way was home
Guess I'm gonna leave come tomorrow
Roll black water roll
Roll black water roll
