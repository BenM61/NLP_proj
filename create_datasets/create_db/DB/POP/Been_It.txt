Baby boy 
Your face is pretty and your life's a toy 
Master man 
I'm never better than your latest plan 

Poor donee 
what are you gonna try to be 
where are you gonna go without me now 
I've been your mother  I've been your father 

who can ask me for more 
I've been your sister  I've been your mistress 
maybe I was your whore 
who can ask me for more 

Superstar 
I've tried to educate your childish heart 
I made your bed 
and I was in it when your faith was dead 

poor donee 
what are you gonna try to be 
where are you gonna go without me now

I'm you personal pro, you know 
you know what number to try when to cry
