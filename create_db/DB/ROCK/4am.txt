It'll get you on the last bus home
Get you at the discount bend
It'll get you on the old dance floor
Get you as the party ends

Oh 4am, is the time when you were mine
Frozen in deepest sleep, for only I to keep
Now there ain't no hiding place on earth
That loneliness ain't been first

It'll get you hanging out your clothes
Get you as you wash your hair
It'll get you as you're making plans
Catch you trying to climb the stairs

Oh 4am, is the time when you were mine
Frozen in deepest sleep, watching the morning creep
Now there ain't no hiding place on earth
That loneliness ain't been first

Hard times, hole in my heart, who stole the sun and
Left me alone again
Give me a guiding light, a stretch of sky and a hand on
My shoulder singing

Hard times, hole in my heart, who stole the sun and
Left me alone again
Give me a guiding light, a stretch of sky and a hand on
My shoulder

Oh 4am, is the time when were mine
Frozen in deepest sleep, for only I to keep
Now there ain't no place on earth
That loneliness ain't been first

Oh no, there ain't no hiding place on earth
That loneliness ain't been first, been first, been first
