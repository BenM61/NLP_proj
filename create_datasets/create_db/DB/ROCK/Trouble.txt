Oh

We were at the table by the window, the view
Casting shadows, the sun was pushing through
Spoke a lot of words, I don't know if I spoke the truth

Got so much to lose
Got so much to prove
God don't let me lose my mind

Trouble on my left, trouble on my right
I've been facing trouble almost all my life
My sweet love, won't you pull me through?
Everywhere I look I catch a glimpse of you
I said it was love and I did it for life (did-did it for you)

Oh

We will come to pass, will I pass the test?
You know what they say, yeah
The wicked get no rest
You can have my heart, any place, any time

Got so much to lose
Got so much to prove
God don't let me lose my mind

Trouble on my left, trouble on my right
I've been facing trouble almost all my life
My sweet love, won't you pull me through?
Everywhere I look I catch a glimpse of you
I said it was love and I did it for life (did-did it for you)

Trouble on my left, trouble on my right
I've been facing trouble almost all my life
My sweet love, won't you pull me through?
Everywhere I look I catch a glimpse of you
I said it was love and I did it for life (did-did it for you)

Oh

Got so much to lose
Got so much to prove
God don't let me lose my mind
