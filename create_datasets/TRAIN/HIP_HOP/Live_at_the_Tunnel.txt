(Jadakiss) 
My outlet is full of powerful niggas 
Electrify ya tie  spark up the lah 
Keep the room dark  let me fill out my high 
Then slap box my ghost 'til one of us cry 
Jae to the Won  can niggas f*ck around? 
And they better say "nah"  word to Allah 
They dyin' down  I got iron now 
Run upon 'em  cock it back tie 'em down 
If he try to move then I gotta lie him down 
From why O  aka Riot Town 
I used to buy it, but I just supply it now 
y'all used to talk, but you're all quiet now 
You know what it is that really makes it scrape it 
Have a lot of cars, and the lot still vacent 
And you won't stop speakin' 'til I leave you on the cement 
Leakin', all hot none eatin' 

(Yogi) 
Slow down son, you're kill 'em 
Ok you can bring it to 'em 
Everyday, just like Mary J. 
Sippin' iced teas in the E & J 
Partyin', 'til your bare remain 
You're killin' 'em, ok you bring it to 'em 
Everyday, just like Mary J. 
Honeys at the bar sippin' Alaze 
Cru and Lox is your hair remain 
I know you brailin' me, baby 
Yogi's in the lead, you're trailin' me, baby 
The PHd's can't compete mines is better than yours 
Then we can take it to the streets, my rum's redder than yours 
BX where the attic sniffy chalk outline 
And the clubs they shout mine, shit's about time 
Chad and Mighty Ha key the predicate felon 
When he make bell he eat more booty than Ellen 
Who you tellin'? 
The world is mine like Esco 
If not, at least a house and Esgro 
Turnin' ghetto stars into Uncle Tom's 
Yogi, the mellow low key 
Understandin' my crew is strictly Shark Bar 
Champagne toastin' while you splittin' Clark Bars 
I'd rather be live at The Tunnel with Flex 
Then on the corner holdin' bundles, next 

(Styles) 
why-O's time to see the hunger in me 
And I see the same thing in niggas younger than me 
Like they live, they ain't got a slice to give 
In the broken down home and they priceless kids 
Why wouldn't it grab the gun, heist the crib 
And the never learn shit until twice their bid 
Like the world turn around funny clown money 
Everybody laugh when they have it 
What about the addic niggas that'll hustle for years 
'Til they see the graveyard up at the tip 
Playin' spades, you in the world and playin' sharades 
If the wait jumped off you ain't touch a gernade 
want to die for the cause? 
Lie for the doors 
Niggas want to play but never took time to pause 
Learned to remind and check the phat four 
Try to plug it in they want to slice up the chords 

(Chadio) 
Yo, yo if you got the doe, be	, than show me 
Cause I'm walkin' these streets and no one know me 
It's gon' change though, with the ill strange flow 
In the 9-8 push my a black Range Rove 
I keeps the real, separate from the fake 
If I kill, yo, I'm doin so for the cake 
Blastin' go to a distant land 
See my gun's like church to a Christain man 
It's the code of the streets no time the explain 
Free that soul on up to the next plain 
Remember the pain, two shots from the flame 
Remember the bloodstains, the cold wet rain 
Little light guys with little white lies 
We takin' out cash and flippin' big white pies 
You rather run wild with your 9 mil. slant 
You watchin' too much Stallone and Van Damme 

(Sheek) 
Yo Lox, what the f*ck, what the f*ck walked in here 
Where my crew at, wave your shit in the air 
Now bust 'em once for the niggas who ain't with you 
And jam above , show muthaphuckin' love 
We make cake, but to make cake you need batter 
So it ain't kickin' that shit the beat ain't gonna matter 
Lox and Cru, el familia to you 
So if you want it you can get the 60 shot pronto 
Sheek that kid that spit out like tabacco 
Lyrically fucked out, a fit ain't chips, we ducked out 
Won't touch out if it ain't a 7 figure route 
Aye yo, Chad papa, where that cranberry and vodka 
Let's get flicks, spit on the niggas like this 
From why-O to be	-X y'all niggas straight C. S. 
But we count the Benjamins and collect Che-X 
My begets shine on my neck like I'm flex 

(Mighty Ha) 
Give 'em what they want, this what they lookin' for 
why-O-G, Chadio and The Mighty Ha 
Hit 'em in data once again with buttah hits 
Baby Chris ridin' with my peeps Mark Pitts 
Comin' with the buttahs, production why-O-G 
Grab a chickenhead, lets crack the bubbly 
Flows by the Gods cause the styles pronto 
Dayes ya go, dayes ya go
