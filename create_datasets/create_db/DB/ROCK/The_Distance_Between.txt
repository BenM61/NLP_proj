Here we go again, wasting each other's time
The look in your eyes, when they look into mine
Brings into view, the distance between me and you

(Oh no)
Here we go again, through the same old misery
Look into my eyes, and it's easy to see
We can't undo, the distance between me and you

'Cause the years have gone by, and you and I
Have been through heaven and hell,
I've felt the joy in your heart, seen your world fall apart
We know each other well

And through promises broken, words left unsaid
Pride has been injured, and tears have been shed
That's why it's true, there's a distance between me and you

Yet both of us know, in the back of our minds
When it comes right down to the bottom line
We'll make it through, the distance between me and you

Whenever I've needed someone, you've always seemed
To be the first friend I've found
When you needing someone, you've got to know
That I'll never let you down
I'll always be right around

'Cause the years have gone by, and you and I
Have been through heaven and hell,
I've felt the joy in your heart, seen your world fall apart
We know each other well

And I know that we know, in the back of our minds
When it comes right down to the bottom line
We'll make it through, this distance between me and you
Yeah, we'll undo, the distance between me and you
We'll break right on through the distance between me and you
