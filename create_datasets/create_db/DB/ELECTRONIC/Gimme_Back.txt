I need my hands
I need my feet
Gimme my soul
I'm incomplete

I need my eyes
I want my teeth
Gimme my scope
Give me my beliefs

Oh, here I hang on this hook, line, and sinker
Don't take the skin off my fingers

I need my arms
My back is bent
I want my hope
I'm deficient

I need my blood
I want my space
Gimme my dream
I rest my case

Oh, here I hang on this hook, line, and sinker
Don't take the skin off my fingers

Like a fire without a flame
Desert with no rain

I need my face
I want my beat
Gimme my pulse
I'm in retreat

I need my hair
I want my voice
Gimme my vision
Gimme back my choice

Oh, here I hang on this hook, line, and sinker
Don't take the skin off my fingers

Like a fire without a flame
Desert with no rain

Oh, mountain high
I'm in so deep
Look down, on I
Take these chains from off my feet

I'm a fire without a flame
Desert with no rain

I want my beat
I'm incomplete
I want my face
I rest my case
