I want surprises
Your sweet nature darling
Was too hard to swallow
I got the solution
I'm leaving tomorrow
And now as I stand
And stare into your eyes
I see safety there
I want surprises

What I really need to do
Is find myself a brand new lover
Somebody who lies with me
Who doesn't notice all the others

When you wake up tomorrow
You'll be all alone
All the love that we had
I have quickly outgrown
I wanted to stay
But I just couldn't do it
Couldn't stand there
And put you through it

My other loves will tell you
That I'm nothing but a pleasure seeker
And for once I really must agree
I need to leave you by yourself
And go in search of someone else
To satisfy my curiosity

Your sweet nature darling
Was too hard to swallow
I made my decision I'm leaving tomorrow

Your sweet nature darling
Was too hard to swallow
