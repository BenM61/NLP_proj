If it's on it's on for good (yeah)
'Cause when it's gone it's gone for good
Let me tell you

And if you stayed over
You know we would, if we could
Put it back together
Make it good

If I
If I

Breathe in the future, breathe out the past (yeah)
Savor this moment as long as it lasts
Let me tell you

Put it back, piece by piece
If you stayed over I'd make it so sweet
I'd make you remember, baby
From your head to your feet

And if you go now, baby
We'll never know how it ends
Make it good

And if you go now, baby
We'll never know how it ends
Make it good

And if you go now, baby
We'll never know how it ends
Make it good

And if you go now, baby
We'll never know how it ends
Make it good
