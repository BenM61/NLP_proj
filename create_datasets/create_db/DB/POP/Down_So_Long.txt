The sun sets across the ocean
I'm a thousand miles from anywhere
And my pocketbook and my heart
Both just got stolen and the sun acts like
She don't even care the wind blows cold
When you reach the to feels like someones face
Is stuck to the bottom of my shoe
I got a plastic Jesus
And a cordless telephone
For every corner of my room
Got everybody but you
Telling me what to do

But I've been down so long
Oh, it cant be longer still
Ive been down so long
That the end must be drawing near

I look to everybody but me
To answer my prayers
Until I saw an angel
In a bathroom
Who said she saw no one
Worth saving anywhere
And a blind man on the corner
Said, its simple,
Like flipping a coin
Don't matter what side it lands on
If its someone else's dime

But I've been down so long
Oh, it cant be longer still
We've been down for so long
That the end must be drawing near

I take a trip, I catch a train, I catch a plane
I got a ticket in my hand
And then a fat man takes my money
And like cattle we all stand

But we've been down so long
Oh, it cant be longer still
We've been down so long
The end must be
I know the end must be
Oh, I know the end must be, drawing near
