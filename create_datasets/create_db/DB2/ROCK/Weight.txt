I pulled in to Nazareth, was feeling 'bout half past dead 
I just need some place where I can lay my head 
'Hey mister, can you tell me where a man might find a bed?'
He just grinned and shook my hand, 'No' was all he said

Take a load off, Fanny 
Take a load for free 
Take a load off, Fanny 
And you put the load right on me 

I picked up my bags, I went looking for a place to hide 
When I saw Carmen and the Devil walking side by side 
I said 'Hey Carmen, come on, let's go downtown' 
She said 'I gotta go but my friend can stick around'

Oh, take a load off, Fanny 
Take a load for free 
Take a load off, Fanny 
And you put the load right on me 

Go down Moses, there's nothing you can say 
It's just old Luke, and Luke's waiting on the judgment day 
'Well, Luke my friend, what about young Anna-Lee?' 
He said 'do me a favor son, won't you stay and keep Anna-Lee company?'

Take a load off, Fanny 
Take a load for free 
Take a load off, Fanny 
And you put the load right on me 

Catch a cannonball now to take me down the line 
My bag is sinking low and I do believe it's time 
To get back to Miss Fanny, you know she's the only one 
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone

Take a load off, Fanny 
Take a load for free 
Take a load off, Fanny 
And you put the load right on me

Yeah!
