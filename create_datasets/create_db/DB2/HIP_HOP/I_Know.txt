I caught your eye looking my way but you seem so shy
Don't be scared I won't hurt you and darling that's no lie
Believe I can give things to you, you never ever dreamed
I won't give up to you possess in life the finer things.

I know, know what you do what 
Lady stop the faking 
Come on and get with me baby drive me crazy
Feel me, hold me, love me, squeeze me
Feel me, hold me, love me, squeeze me

With you it seems to be to me you want but you've been hurt
I know this game just so you know I want just one and only one
Playing the field seems file to me if you've got love to give
In life there is no time to waste and that's not the way to live.

I know, know what you do what 
Lady stop the faking 
Come on and get with me baby drive me crazy
Feel me, hold me, love me, squeeze me

(be my lady)
I'll never do you wrong
(drive my Mercedes)
All the things you can own
(you're so precious)
You're my queen
(you're my baby)
You're my baby

I know, know what you do what 
Lady stop the faking 
Come on and get with me baby drive me crazy
Feel me, hold me, love me, squeeze me
