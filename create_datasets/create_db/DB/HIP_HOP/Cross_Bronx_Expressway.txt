featuring Big Punisher  Fat Joe 

Intro: Lord Tariq 
Yea  yea  One more time 
Seventies shit  got the lean 
Shit is leanin  it's to the left 
It's just leanin  dribblin 
Like he gave it a bag of dugy 
Or a bag of that Tango and Cash 
It's just leanin and shit  seventies (The Lord Tariq) 

Verse 1: Lord Tariq 
Ayo I been through many places 
Done many things 
Seen the eyes of many faces 
From New York to Texas 
To the faces on Rolexes 
Not a racist or sexist 
And the best is the Lord, none the less is Gunz 
Nothin less than a Lexus 
Bubble eye with be	-be	-S's 
Trouble minds and troubled times 
Stacks, I'm tryin to double mine 
I'm in a six wit double dimes and a couple a nines 
Me and tracks back to back, circle the block a couple of times 
And we searchin for this nigga to try 
I'm bubblin mine 
If we don't get him now then we will in due time 
I bust enough shots to kill him two times 
I do crimes 
I get caught then my mind's defindin my son's rhymes 
Cause my thoughts stay runnin like thugs from one-time 
I been through it under the influence 
Bustin off I'm runnin into it 
See me say he didn't do it 
Put the nine to his mind and blew it 
Cause some times I lose it give me a gun and I'll abuse it 
Puffin with my family, my bitch, my money or my music 
Makin killas say he's to sick when he do shit 
But I'm on some new shit 
And it's too late the fuse lit 
I treat my nine like a new bitch 
And the shit do kick, word

Verse 2: Fat Joe 
Play rap loud, politicin business 
Wit the crack crowd, fact file, funny how I never seen a rat smile 
My last trial's one of the reasons why I rap now 
But still could blaow any nigga actin irrat' now 
Fuckin with me's worse than duckin police 
After puffin some trees I'll probably be abductin your niece 
Murderin beats since the days of permanent crease 
Been around the block seen grams converted to keys 
Aah Cartagena, breaks hearts in Argentine 
My misses slugs to love me, my wife act like Anita 
Terror Squad'll die for the cause even if it means blowin up things 
And takin over City Hall 
My shit is raw straight from the Panama shores 
If the feds can't catch me then they make up a law 
Can't take it no more, niggas is fake to the core 
My state pen friends'll leave you broken negative nore 
Bet it all on the Terror Squad click from Forrest 
Real Bronx niggas that's heartless that spark shit 
Regardless, niggas shouldn't have tried that shit 
That's why mothafuckas gotta die like this

Verse 3: Peter Gunz 
I had a dream that a team had a scheme keepin the beam 
On my head like a infrarred he's dead, but I redeem 
Now I'm back nigga, it's on nigga 
Run nigga, Joe nigga, Pun nigga, Lord nigga 
Gunz mothafuckas ain't really knowin I'm really goin 
And feelin I'm showin that my main objective is Benz and Lexuses 
Cop Rolexeses, get bigot in Texases 
So fierce bitches they be callin me exorcist 
Far from a devil, I'm God I mean I'm Gunz 
And I shine like sun 
Rhyme like none 
Find my gun 
Got beef with this nigga with hits and shit 
Chips and shit, run around here switchin shit 
Tellin people don't play that, you gotta play this 
Tellin school you ain't sayin that, you gotta say this 
You can't wear that, you gotta wear this 
Well hear this, I'll go in yo chest and leave you earless, fearless 
The only thing between us if you stop my cream 
Is a glock nineteen 
And I'ma pop like steam 
Tryin to stop me and mine from eatin you need a doctor 
With a hundred gauze pads nigga to stop you from leakin 
And a prayer from the deacon as you weaken 
And words from the Funkmaster Flex dogs shouldn't have been reachin 
There's only one Gunz, from what it's worth 
That's me, that's it, buryin shit, right in the earth

Verse 4: Big Punisher 
Yo we the Bronx avengers 
Partners in these peelan adventures 
We the monster niggas in your dreams that be stompin ya senseless 
So be conscious of us, if you march against us 
I'm a call my gentas and you nondescripters gonna have to face the 
consequences 
We large placentas and you small change 
Hittin niggas long range, wrong gauge 
Leavin niggas John Blaze 
Crime pays if you nice with yours 
The Bronx is where you fight for yours 
Ice across, slice cigars, light cigars 
All day, wylin freestylin in the hallways 
Broadway ain't got more drama than Watson off a card game 
This ain't the old days shorties was bustin, ain't no fuckin jokin 
Some nigga called me a German, I had to bust him open 
My brothers holdin me down with heavy artillery 
Chevies and willies be chilin in front of every facility 
Joey from Trinity so he raps Forrest 
You could save the best for us 
But you still better place your bets on us 
The Bronx baby, where the best get blown 
My restin zone, come on nigga test your throne 
I'm blessed with chrome, so leave your vest at home 
I don't aim for the chest bitch, strictly necks and domes
