I'm in love with the bossonova
He's the one with the cashanova
I'm in love with his heart of steel
I'm in love
I'm in love with the bossonova
He's the one with the cashanova
I'm in love with his heart of steel
I'm in love

How come no-one ever told me
Who I'm working for
Down among the rich men baby
And the poor

Here comes love forever
And it's here comes love for no-one
Oh here comes love for Marilyn
And it's oh my baby oh-oh my baby
What you gonna do?
In the reason in the rain

Still support the revolution

I want it I want it I want that too
Baby Baby it's up to you
To find out somethin' that you need to do
Because

I'm in love with a Jacques Derrida
Read a page and know what I need to
Take apart my baby's heart
I'm in love
I'm in love with a Jacques Derrida
Read a page and know what I need to
Take apart my baby's heart
I'm in love

To err is to be human
To forgive is too divine
I was like an industry
Depressed and in decline

Here comes love for ever
And it's here comes love for no-one
Oh here comes love for Marilyn
And it's oh my baby oh my baby
What you gonna do?
In the reason - in the rain

Still support the revolution

I want it I want it I want that too
Baby Baby it's up to you
To find out somethin' that you need to do
Because

Oh I'm in love with bop sh'dayo
Out of Camden Town for a day oh
I'm in love with just gettin' away
I'm in love
Oh I'm in love with militante
Reads Unita and reads Avanti
I'm in love with her heart of steel
I'm in love

He held it like a cigarette
Behind a squadee's back
He held it so he hid it's length
And so he hid it's lack oh
An' it seems so very sad
(All right!)

Well I want better than you can give
But then I'll take whatever you got
Cos I'm a grand libertine with the
Kinda demeanor to overthrow the lot
I said rapacious
Rapacious you can never satiate
(Ate what!) desire is so voracious
I wanna eat your nation state

I got incentive that you can't handle
I got the needs you can't assuage
I got demands you can't meet
'N stay on your feet
I want more than your living wage

Well I want better than you can give
But then I'll take whatever you got
Cos I'm a grand libertine with the
Kinda demeanor to overthrow the lot
I said rapacious
Rapacious you can never satiate
(Ate what!) desire is so voracious
I wanna eat your nation state
