Life's complexities trouble your rise,
As you attempt to ascend into the high,
Is there nowhere else left to run,
But to the kosmos, men gaze, to look for heaven.
Flying high, never come down
Flying high, don't know how to come down

Take a ride into the soon,
Be the first one on the moon,
Take a slide, come back to earth,
But it's to the kosmos, men dare, to look for something.

Flying high, never come down
Flying high, don't know how to come down

No time to spare, destiny is here
No time to lose, better if we choose
Less time to share
People stop and stare,
To look for hope above the clouds
To look for heaven

A world away, a million light years
That's how far destruction seems
Now our dreams are sad, slow creatures
Dying to know, who am I?, what am I? 
Where am I to go?
