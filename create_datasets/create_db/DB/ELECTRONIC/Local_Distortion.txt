Felt in love again
Why
Disordered minds
(Guarantinca nation drifting trancey)
Unfamiliar smile
For a while
To weak to sick for freak-vency

Miss calculating incline
Open wide
Tickle and jiggle
In a rigidity giggle

Irresponsible mind
Of human kind
Makes, create, produce, fabricate
Fickle

Local distortion
