I just bought a new grill
Shining like a new whip
Adam got a new drip
I'm a nappy-headed black lil cool kid
Yeah, I stack that, make that, break that, take that
Got a hundred ways I can flip that, get back
All up in the money just to get back
Bitch, back up
No, you probably need a Tic Tac, it's that (huh)
Bitch, you frontin' on me
Why you wanna act like this?
Rollie on my wrist so she wanna have kids
Cuffs on my wrist so the cops don't trip

I-I'm too fly to fight
Can't afford my price
This a white tee (clean)
Bitch, bite me (hey!)
I'm on the high (I'm on the high)
They on the low (they on the low)
You're killin' my vibe (killin' it)
Get out my zone
Said, I'm on the high (I'm on the high)
They on the low (you on the low)
You're killin' my vibe (killin' it)
Get out my zone (get out my zone, bitch)

I'm the best in the group chat
My niggas won't admit that
Thirty-one hoes in my Facetime
And I'm the one to hoop that
Rockin' and rollin' like Jack Black
Schoolin' you niggas like Jack Black
How could you not like Jack Black?
I put that on my mama, nigga, no cap
Look, I hand it to Yos, he hand it to John
Shawty wanna f*ck for a picture
Bitch, this ain't a Groupon
This that CLBN
Go ahead, bump it with mom
Said she want a spot on my list
I told her go pray to your god (I need to go to church)
Yeah, I dick that, flip that, make that, check back
When I wanna get it back ASAP
It's that young nigga back, no six pack
F*ck that, I'm too rich for the chit-chat

I-I'm too fly to fight
Can't afford my price
This a white tee (clean)
Bitch, bite me (hey!)
I'm on the high (I'm on the high)
They on the low (they on the low)
You're killin' my vibe (killin' it)
Get out my zone
Said, I'm on the high (I'm on the high)
They on the low (you on the low)
You're killin' my vibe (killin' it)
Get out my zone (get out my zone, bitch)
