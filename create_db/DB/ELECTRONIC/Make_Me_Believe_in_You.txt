Make me believe in you
Show me your love that's true
I'd do anything you want me to
Make me believe in you

Don't ask any questions
Don't be so shameless

You are my temptation
Show me inspiration

Show me your love that's true

Make me believe in you

Ain't (knocking) to (get laid)
You can take me dancing
From the palace to pavement
There's no understatement
I want you

You are my temptation
Show me inspiration

Make me believe in you
Show me your love that's true
I'd do anything you want me to
Make me believe in you
