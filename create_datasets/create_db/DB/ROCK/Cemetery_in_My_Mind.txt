Locked in the mall in a state of fright
Looking for salvation in a car headlight
But you can't have what you can't buy

Tomorrow is better than yesterday,
Tomorrow is better than today,
Tomorrow is better than yesterday they say

Cemetery in my mind
Cemetery in my mind
This must be my time

Wake work drink sleep retire
Tide comes up way too high
You can fall but can you rise

Cemetery in my mind,
You can fall but can you rise
There's no pulse no sign of life,
Cemetery in my mind.
