You ought to see my blue eyed Sally
She lives a way down on Shinbone Alley
The number on the gate, the number on the door
And the next house over is the grocery store

Stay all night, stay a little longer
Dance all night, dance a little longer
Pull off your coat throw it in the corner
Don't see why you don't stay a little longer

Can't go home if you're going by the mill
'Cause the bridge washed out at the bottom of the hill
Big creek's up, and the big creek's level
Plow my corn with a double shovel

Stay all night, stay a little longer
Dance all night, dance a little longer
Pull off your coat throw it in the corner
Don't see why you don't stay a little longer

Sitting in the window, singing to my love
When slop bucket fell from the window up above
Mule and the grasshopper eating ice cream
Mule got sick and they laid him on the green

Stay all night, stay a little longer
Dance all night, dance a little longer
Pull off your coat throw it in the corner
Don't see why you don't stay a little longer

Grab your gal and pat her on the head
If she don't like biscuits, feed her cornbread
The gals around big creek, about half grown
They jump on a man like a dog on a bone

Stay all night, stay a little longer
Dance all night, dance a little longer
Pull off your coat throw it in the corner
Don't see why you don't stay a little longer

Stay all night, stay a little longer
Dance all night, dance a little longer
Pull off your coat throw it in the corner
Don't see why you don't stay a little longer
