Don't take me by the hand and walk me through with pity
If I was a man, would you still do the same?
I'm fending for myself when you still call me pretty
Let me walk away
Let me walk away
Let me walk away
Let me walk away
Let me walk away
Let me walk away
Let me walk away
Let me walk away

Don't kitty, kitty cat me like I'm just your pussy
Any other night, you'd treat me just the same
I'm fending for myself when you still call me pretty
Let me walk away
Let me walk away
Let me walk away
Let me walk away
Let me walk away
Let me walk away
Let me walk away
Let me walk away
