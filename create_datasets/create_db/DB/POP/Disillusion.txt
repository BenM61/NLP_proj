Seems you created your own illusion
Fueled by an image of me
Well I couldn't stay at your side
It wouldn't be right
A picture that I just don't see
Why do you have to make it so complicated
Can't it just be beautiful
I don't want to stifle your flight
I didn't mean to fall in love

Always in pursuit of the perfect people
Oh and I can see that it shows
But there's just an innocence in you I want to wring out
I know it could be beautiful

But I don't want a part of some situation
I don't want to be in that boat
I don't want to stifle your flight
I didn't mean to fall in love

Seems you created your own illusion
Fueled by an image of me
Well I couldn't stay at your side
It wouldn't be right
A picture that I just don't see
