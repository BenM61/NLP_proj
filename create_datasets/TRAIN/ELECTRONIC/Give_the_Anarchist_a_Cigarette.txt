Albert! Who?
Bobby! Who?
For god's sake, burn it down

Nothing ever burns down by itself
Every fire needs a little bit of help
Nothing ever burns down by itself
Every fire needs a little bit of...

Give the anarchist a cigarette
'Cause that's as close as he's ever gonna get
Give the anarchist a cigarette
Bobby just hasn't learned it yet
Give the anarchist a cigarette
The times are changing, but he just forgets
Give the anarchist a cigarette
He's gonna to choke on his harmonica, Albert

Nothing ever burns down by itself
Every fire needs a little bit of help
Nothing ever burns down by itself
Every fire needs a little bit of...

Give the anarchist a cigarette
A candy cig for the spoiled brat
Give the anarchist a cigarette
We'll get Albert to write you a cheque
Give the anarchist a cigarette
He'll be burning up the air in his personal jet
Give the anarchist a cigarette
You know I hate every Popstar that I ever met

Nothing ever burns down by itself
Every fire needs a little bit of help
Nothing ever burns down by itself
Every fire needs a little bit of...

Give the anarchist a cigarette
Burn, baby, burn
Burn, baby, burn

Give the anarchist a cigarette
Burn, baby, burn
Burn, baby, burn

Give the anarchist a cigarette
Burn, baby, burn
Burn, baby, burn

Give the anarchist a cigarette
Burn, baby, burn
Burn, baby, burn

Nothing ever burns down by itself
Every fire needs a little bit of help
Nothing ever burns down by itself
Every fire needs a little bit of help
Nothing ever burns down by itself
Every fire needs a little bit of help
Nothing ever burns down by itself
Every fire needs a little bit of help
Nothing ever burns down by itself
Every fire needs a little bit of help
Nothing ever burns down by itself
Every fire needs a little bit of help
Nothing ever burns down by itself
Every fire needs a little bit of help
Nothing ever burns down by itself
Every fire needs a little bit of help
Nothing ever burns down by itself
Every fire needs a little bit of help
Nothing ever burns down by itself
Every fire needs a little bit of help
