Blackjack David came a-ridin? through the wood
Singin? so loud and merry
His voice was a-ringin? through the green, green fields
And he spied a fair-haired maiden
Spied a fair haired maiden

?Listen here lass, my name is Jack
And I come from afar
Lookin? for a fair haired lass like you
Won't you come and be my bride
Come and be my bride??

?Now would you forsake your husband, dear
Would you forsake your baby
Would you forsake your fine, fine home
To go with a Blackjack David
Go with Blackjack David??

?Yes, I?d forsake my husband, dear
And I?d forsake my baby
And I?d forsake my fine, fine home
Just to go with you Blackjack David
Go with you Blackjack David?

She put on her high heeled boots
Made of Spanish leather
And he pulled her up behind him then
And they both rode off together
Both rode off together

Well, last night she slept in a fine, fine bed
Beside her husband and baby
Tonight she sleeps on a cold, cold ground
Beside old Blackjack David
Beside old Blackjack David

Beside old Blackjack David
Beside old Blackjack David
