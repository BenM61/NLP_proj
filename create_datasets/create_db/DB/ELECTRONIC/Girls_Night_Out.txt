Whoa-ah-ah-ah-oh

Goin' out on the weekend
Gettin' dressed with my girls
Put on my favorite lip gloss
Cherry Garcia swirl
Perfume, pleasure, and platforms
Livin' that kind of world (Ooh-ooh)
We're gonna live it up tonight

So, if you're out with your girls
And if you feel on top of the world
Whoa-ah-ah-ah-oh
Out with your girls
I can't wait to live it up tonight

It's a girls' night out
Let's have a girls' night out tonight
It's a girls' night out
Let's have a girls' night out tonight
I can't wait to live it up tonight
It's a girls' night out
No boys, no boys
No boys, no boys
No boys, no boys
It's a girls' night out

When we're out at the Weekend (Woo woo)
R.I.P to the club (Bang, bang)
'Cause we walk in and kill it (Mwah!)
DJ, hey, turn it up (Oh, yeah!)
Sing along like we wrote it (La la la lala la)
Screamin' out all the words (Ooh-ooh)
We're gonna live it up tonight

So, if you're out with your girls
And if you feel on top of the world
Whoa-ah-ah-ah-oh
Out with your girls
I can't wait to live it up tonight

It's a girls' night out
Let's have a girls' night out tonight
