New York 
Grey and sorrow there to meet her
Night sky hangs
Around to greet her
She throws down
Lifeline of kisses
Anchored to the ground
Balloon descending

Then I see balloon is burning
Turning round burning

This balloon, burning
Fragments of my life
Falling
Sky of tire
All consuming

Then I see balloon is burning
Turning round burning

This balloon, burning
