Oh baby now let's get down tonight
Baby, I'm hot just like your oven
I need some lovin'
And baby, I can't hold it much longer
It's getting stronger and stronger
When I get this feeling I want
Sexual healing
Sexual healing
It makes me feel so fine
It helps to relieve my mind

Sexual healing, is good for us
Sexual healing is something that is so very good for me
Whenever these blue tear drops are falling, oh no
And my emotional stability is leaving me
But there is something I can do
Oh I can get on the telephone and call you up baby
Darling I know you'll be there to relieve me
The love you give to me will free me
So if you don't know the things you're dealing
Well I can tell you darling, oh it's

Sexual healing
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Let's make love tonight
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
'Cause you do it right
Heal me, my darling
Heal me, my darling
Heal me, my darling
Heal me, my darling
Baby, I got sick this morning

Well a sea was storming inside of me
Baby, I think I'm capsizing
The waves are rising and rising
And when I get this feeling I want
Sexual healing
Sexual healing
It makes me feel so fine
It helps to relieve the mind
Sexual healing, is good for us
Sexual healing, darling, is good for us

Oh it?s good for us, oh it's so good to me
My baby Whoahohh
Just grab a hold
Come take control
Of my body and mind
Soon we'll be making love
Honey, oh we're feeling fine
You're my medicine open up and let me in
Oh Darling darling, you're so great
I can't wait for you to operate
I can't wait for you to operate
I can't wait for you to operate
I can't wait for you to heal me
I can't wait for you to
Oh whenever these blue teardrops are falling
You know I come calling
Heal me, my darling
