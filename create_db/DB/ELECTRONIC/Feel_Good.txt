Hold me like you want to
Tell me what you're into
Let me take you back to old school
Baby let me show you

It's a big ol' world out there
And I just wanna be next to you
There's a spark in your eyes so rare
And I just know there ain't time to lose

You make me feel good
You make me feel, make me 
Feel, feel good
Make me feel, feel good

Feel, feel good
You make me feel good
You make me feel make me 
Feel, feel good
Make me feel, feel good

You make me feel good
You make me feel, make me 
Feel, feel good
Make me feel, feel good
