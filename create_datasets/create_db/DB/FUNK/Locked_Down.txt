Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Lived reckless so long
Justice system bust me wrong
Future stressed out like a rubber check
Don't be jeffing out the side of your neck
Dealin' from the bottom of the deck
Might make it home to the projects

Don't point no finger at me like you do
Know three of them is pointing back at you
Locked down, locked down!

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Long way from home, walking through a storm
Big yard survival keep me strong
Face I see in that old mirror
Too foggy and it ain't gettin' no clearer
Overcoat me like mess hall rations
Too much for the population

Don't point no finger at me like you do
Know three of them is pointing back at you
Locked down, locked down!

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

I felt invisible everybody
The price of death come too cheap
Robbed and stole in the gap
Popped with a stray cap
Like I cornered rat 
What you all know 'bout that?

Don't point no finger at me like you do
Know three of them is pointing back at you
Locked down, locked down!

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
