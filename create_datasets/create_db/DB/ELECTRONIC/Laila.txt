Laila, laila, laila, laila, lai
Laila, laila, laila, laila, lai

Laila, laila, laila, laila, lai
Laila, laila, laila, laila, lai

I'm justified and banned, baby for your love
Oh, I need you every day
I don't care, my feelings are just enough
This time, oh we'll go my way
It's not a problem, please don't go away
I don't care what people say

Laila, laila, laila, laila, lai
Oh I miss you laila
Laila, laila, laila, laila, lai
Oh I need you laila

Oh, laila it's like ecstasy
Are you ready, oh come fly with me
Oh, little laila, I make dreams come true
In a land of love for me and you

Anytime I see you, I'm hypnotized
Why we're going separate ways
The mystery of love, babe I'm specialized
Oh, I miss you every day
Oh, we're searching just together, girl
Baby, for a better world
