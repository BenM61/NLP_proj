When love becomes less sacred
Your mouth keeps me in trusting
You're sweet like a little cake
Whose family's well-adjusted

Ooh, ooh, uh
Ooh, ooh, uh
Ooh, ooh, uh
Ooh, ooh

There's nothing you want to say
I'm just with you every day
I know it's better than before
So why, why do I need more?

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

If you don't know
I'll leave it alone
You don't let it show
So how would I know?

I'm nice, I'm too nice to you
Now what, what else can I do
When there's nothing more to say
And I'm still with you every day?

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
