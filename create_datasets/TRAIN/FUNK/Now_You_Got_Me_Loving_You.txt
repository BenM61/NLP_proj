You interrupted my life, little girl
Got in my way, got into my world
Now you're telling me, you got to go
It would have been alright about a thousand kisses ago

But now you got me loving you
Now you've got me hooked
Now you got me wanting you
A little bit of your love was all it took

You came along and feel me so
I've never felt satisfaction before
Now it's not so simple just to let you go
But it would have been easy a thousand kisses ago

But now you got me loving you
Oh, now you've got me hooked
Now you got me wanting you
A little bit of your love was all it took

Oh, but now you got me loving you
Now you've got me hooked
Oh, now you got me wanting you
A little bit of your love was all it took

That's all it took, baby, just a little bit
That's all it took, baby, just a little bit
That's all it took, baby, just a little bit

That's all it took, baby, just a little bit
That's all it took, baby, just a little bit
That's all it took, baby, just a little bit

That's all it took, baby, just a little bit
That's all it took, baby, just a little bit
That's all it took, baby, just a little bit
That's all it took, baby, just a little bit

That's all it took, baby, just a little bit
That's all it took, baby, just a little bit
That's all it took, baby, just a little bit
That's all it took, baby, just a little bit
