Mmm, alright
Yeah, hot
Revolution in the city
Revolution in the street
When the circle is in motion
Then the circle is complete, yeah

I`m watching a big wheel
Inside of a big wheel
That`s part of a big wheel
Turn it round
Turn it round

The sun is up there every morning
The moon is up there every night
Revolution keeps us growin` and
Could be yellow, red
Could be black or white

I`m watching a big wheel
Inside of a big wheel
That`s part of a big wheel
Turn it round
I`m hooked on a big wheel
Stuck on a big wheel
In my mind there`s a big wheel
Turn it round
Turn it round

Revolution in the city
Revolution in my mind

I`m watching a big wheel
Inside of a big wheel
That`s part of a big wheel
Turn it round
I`m hooked on a big wheel
Stuck on a big wheel
In my mind there`s a big wheel
Turn it round
Turn it round

Revolution
I`m watching a big wheel
Inside of a big wheel
In my mind there`s a big wheel
Turn it round
Turn it round
Revolution in the city
Turnin` it around
Revolution in the city
Turn it round
Watching a big wheel
Turn it round
Watching a big wheel
Watching a big wheel

Big wheel
Big wheel
Big wheel
