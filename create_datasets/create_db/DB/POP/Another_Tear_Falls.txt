Now and then
I see you passing by
And for a while
I don't begin to cry

But just when I think I'm all cried out

Another tear falls
Another tear falls
And then I know
You are still here in my heart
You are still here in my broken heart

Every time I go with someone new
I tell myself I've gotten over you

But just when I think I'm all cried out

Another tear falls
Another tear falls
And then I know
You are still here in my heart

You are still
Here in my
Broken
Heart
