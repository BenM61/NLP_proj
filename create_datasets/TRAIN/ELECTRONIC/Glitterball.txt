Standing here in the music hall
With my microphone and a glitterball
And you walked right in, blowing through the doors
Like a force of nature, a force of nature
I cannot go, 'cause my head's a mess
But you're beautiful in the way you dress
I'm lost for words and I'm powerless
Right from the beginning

You got me singing ooh
Singing ooh
Singing ooh
Singing, oh
I'm so in love with you
Singing, ooh
Singing, ooh
Singing oh
I'm so in love with you

I'm so in love with you

I thought I lost you in the crowd
But I came up where you stand out
You're like the storm through the evening rage
The bells are ringing

You got me singing ooh
Singing ooh
Singing ooh
Singing, oh
I'm so in love with you
Singing, ooh
Singing, ooh
Singing oh
I'm so in love with you

And I feel love
Do you feel love?
And I feel love

I won't cut ice for you, for you
Just look and see it's true, it's true
So tell me what to do, to do
Don't wait too long

I cannot go, 'cause my head's a mess
But you're beautiful, in the way you dress
I'm lost for words, and I'm powerless
Right from the beginning

You got me singing ooh
Singing ooh
Singing ooh
Singing, oh
I'm so in love with you oh
Oh, I'm so in love
I'm so in love with you

And I feel love
Do you feel love?
And I feel love

And I feel love
Do you feel love?
And I feel love
