If I had a dime for every time,
I dreamed about you
(Dreamed about you)
I'll tell you no joke yes I'm really broke baby without you (girl without you)
And oh ho ho
Tell me what should I do
When you tell me that you love me, darling

(Are you gonna break your promise baby)
You said that you love me
(Are you gonna break your promise to me)
And now you're actin' so strange
(Are you gonna break your promise baby)
You said that you need me
(Are you gonna break your promise to me)

If I saw you with somebody new, I'd be so helpless (be so helpless)
So tell me what are you gonna do, don't leave me breathless (leave me breathless)
And oh ho ho
Tell me what should I do
When you tell me that you love me, darling

(I'm gonna break your promise baby)
You said that you love me
(I'm gonna break your promise to me)

Tell me what should I do
When you tell me that you love me, darling

(I'm gonna break your promise baby)
You said that you love me
(I'm gonna break your promise to me)
Now you're actin' so strange, baby
(I'm gonna break your promise baby)
You said that you need me
(I'm gonna break your promise to me)
