Underneath the new born sun, 
Man and beast rejoice as one, 
They cast aside their age-old kings, 
Smash their chains and spread their wings. 

Their seed corrupt, their lies undone. 
The final fall - man s will be done. 
They torch the sky and rape the land, 
And plead for truth with blood-stained hands. 

Mark their reign with greed and fear, 
As justice calls to deafened ears, 
Their twisted dreams bring forth the day. 
A world of ash, and slow decay. 

Underneath the blackened sun, 
The final battle fought and won. 
Mankind claims their just reward, 
And chaos sounds the final chord.
