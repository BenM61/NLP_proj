Do you know how to pony 
Like Bony Maronie
Do you know how to twist 
Goes like this
Mashed potatoes 
Slow alligator
Twist the twister 
Like little sister
Do you get the Yoyo 
The endless gogo
Do you do the fish 
Goes like this
Do you do the tango 
Takes two to tango
Get down on your knees 
Do the sweet peas
Roll over on your back 
Say I like it like that
Do the watussi 
Do the watussi
Can you do the fly 
With a hand jive
Do you do the slot 
Shakin' in a bop
Then you go home 
So you won't be all alone
So bye bye children
Bye bye children
Come on with me children 
Lets go children
I wanna show you 
This little place
Across the track 
The name of the place 
I'll like it like that 
The name of the band
The fat men
Lets go children
The fat men
Lets go children
