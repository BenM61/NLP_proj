Now blue ain't the word for the way that I feel 
That old storm brewing in this heart of mine 
Someday crazy arms will hold somebody new 
But now I'm so lonely all the time 

Crazy arms that needs to hold somebody new 
While your heart keeps saying "you're not mine, not mine, not mine, not mine" 
My troubled mind grows blue to another you'll be wed 
But now I'm so lonely all the time 

Now take all those precious dreams I had for you and me 
And take all that love I thought was mine 
Some day your crazy arms will hold somebody new 
But now I'm so lonely all the time 

Crazy arms that needs to hold somebody new 
While my yearning heart keeps saying "you're not mine, not mine, not mine, not mine" 
My troubled mind grows blue to another you'll be wed 
But now I'm so lonely all the time
