Praise him for his character has no defects
A shining example, and one to rely on,
The newest messiah rolled into one
Cover his shoulders in primary colors
In primary colors

But as he falls asleep
The colored lights will keep
Unwanted vigil over
Where he is
He doesn't know where he is

Demands of a million, now everyone needs him
Sycophants send him to the edge of reason
Everyone knows him, he knows himself better
Haunted by alpha, he fears that they'll leave him
In primary colors

Our pack leader will confront his fears
Through new kings are born, he'll stay on his throne
Riding through town on a chariot high
Glory adorned and immortalized in primary colors
In primary colors
