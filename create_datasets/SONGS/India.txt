I used to feel I had it all in my hands,
It all came crashing down on me, yeah,
With lipstick on my overall,
And it makes me feel so over awed,
I'm sinking fast,

La, la, la, la, la, la, la India yeah,
La, la, la, la, la, la, la India yeah,

Well, there's just something that I want to say,
And that I want to say,
You always feel so beautiful,
I wish there's somewhere I could away,
That I could get away,
To somewhere warm and beautiful,

Hey, everybody here I am,
I'm the only man, who's ever had a problem,
In the whole world, again,
And lately I've no time for friends as I was before,
I'll be again, don't think too fast,

Well, there's just something that I want to say,
And that I want to say,
You always feel so beautiful,
I wish there's somewhere I could get away,
That I could get away,
To somewhere warm and beautiful,

Oh, you're so jealous of the things that I've become,
You know, that you can't come back this time,
You know, that you can't come back this time,

Well, there's just something that I want to say,
And that I want to say,
You always feel so beautiful,
I wish there's somewhere I could get away,
That I could get away,
To somewhere warm and beautiful,

Oh, you're so jealous of the things that I've become,
You know, that you can't come back this time,
You know, that you can't come back this time.

(Don't you know that you can't come back this time)
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la India yeah)
