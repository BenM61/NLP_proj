Went to see a movie show 
Found myself an empty row
Thought the show was just alright
Same old Saturday night

Then I made the usual stop
Coffee at the coffee shop
Friendly face nowhere in sight
Same old Saturday night

I really thought, the papers I bought
Would help me forget you for a while
Believe me honey, the funnies weren't funny
They didn't even make me smile

How I wish you'd lift the phone
Fun is fun - but not alone
'Till you let me hold you tight
Same old Saturday night

Only your face, can help me erase
That same old Saturday night
