I'm feelin' mighty lonesome 
Haven't slept a wink 
I walk the floor and watch the door 
And in between I drink 
Black coffee 
Love's a hand-me-down brew 
I'll never know a Sunday 
In this weekday room 

I'm talkin' to the shadows 
One o'clock 'til four 
And Lord, how slow the moments go 
When all I do is pour 
Black coffee 
Since the blues caught my eye 
I'm hangin' out on Monday 
My Sunday dreams to dry 

Now man was born to go a lovin' 
But was a woman born to weep and fret 
To stay at home and tend her oven 
And down her past regrets 
In coffee and cigarettes 

I'm moonin' all the mornin' 
Moanin' all the night 
And in between it's nicotine 
And not much heart to fight 
Black coffee 
Feelin' low as the ground 
It's drivin' me crazy 
This waitin' for my baby 
To maybe come around
