I might be old but I'm someone new she said
I'm so sore that I could cry always
In the night lay your tired arms

She will have her way
Somehow I will still believe her

She's the life I've been frightened of seems like
Deathly silence and especially the dark
Feels like I am heavy and my spirit has died

She will have her way
Somehow I will still believe her
She will have her way
One day I will come back

Still no end in sight
Though I travel far and wide
A dying man is doing time
Thinker, soldier terrified

And she will have her way
Somehow I will still believe her
She will have her way
One day I will come back

She will have her way
When the time has gone away
She will have her way
She will have her way
But not before time
She will have her way
