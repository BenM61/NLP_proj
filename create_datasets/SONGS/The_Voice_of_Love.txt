Listen to the rhythm of the wind in the trees
It satisfies my soul
We're just a touch of their mystery
That filled me with the longing to know

I don't know where it first began
But it's always here when I'm with you
And all the time I've wasted
When I doubted or hesitated
Is given back to me anew

I walk with angels in my mind
I talk with angels in my mind
I walk with angels in my mind
Into the garden out of time

Here in the garden there's a window on truth
It's a mirror where everything prays
Naked as we stand in the golden light
It takes my breath away

For there's a presence deep within
Where we are joined one and the same
And Nature's every face now
Every image in time and space now
Comes into focus in the frame

I walk with angels in my mind
I talk with angels in my mind
I walk with angels in my mind
Into the garden out of time

I would sing with the voice of love
The stories yet untold
I would sing with the voice of love
That's neither young nor old

And when the Sun comes speaking through the sky at dawn
I know that love will hold me when I fall
And never let me go until I be just who I truly am
And shine in radiance

I would sing with the voice of love
I would sing with the voice of love
I would sing with the voice of love
Voice of love
Voice of love
Voice of love
