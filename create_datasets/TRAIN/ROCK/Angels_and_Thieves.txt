You say I'm letting life slip by, and star lights wasted on sleeping eyes
I stare all night into the sky, when all these stars have long since died
I've woken up a thousand times, drawn the curtain, drawn the line
A thousand lives walk through my own,
I stand still and stand alone

I wish I could believe, in something bigger
In the space that lies between, the good and bad here
The angels and thieves are drinking coffee,
But I just want some sleep

An end to this day's masquerade,
A suitcase packed and put away
The mirror is useless in the night,
I see myself between the light

I wish I could believe, in something bigger
In the space that lies between, the good and bad here
The angels and the thieves are drinking coffee

But I just want some time
Time, time, time
The angels and the thieves, are drinking coffee,
But I don't want to sleep.

I wish I could believe, in something bigger
In the space that lies between, the good and bad here
The angels and the thieves, oh the angels and the thieves, are drinking coffee,
But I just want some sleep
