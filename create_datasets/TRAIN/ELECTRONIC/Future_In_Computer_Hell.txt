No need for confetti bombs
Or phallus symbols
To be obnoxious, outrageous
But the sound will be very contagious
Like nuclear fallout radius

No need for bands with tight Spandex
Macho flex, high voices from Larynex
Tight jockstraps stuffed with socks
With walnuts to show sex
But plain, obscure, high tech

Junkie XL will tell
Junkie XL will tell
Junkie XL will tell
The future in computer hell

Junkie XL will tell
Junkie XL will tell
Junkie XL will tell
The future in computer hell

No slacker trendy attitudes
Or boys that play so crude
Or smokers obsessed on weed
To be hardcore with fatigues
Let the perpetrator weep

That is the Junkie beats that grim reap
And shuffle the feet and put all asleep
In front of their MTV screens sweep
Lost souls are in deep
In their trash cash, middle class heap

Junkie XL will tell
Junkie XL will tell
Junkie XL will tell
The future in computer hell

Junkie XL will tell
Junkie XL will tell
Junkie XL will tell
The future in computer hell

We, the Junkie megabyte creep, hell
