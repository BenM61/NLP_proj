There's a kiss in the dark
Someone speaks
Its a start
Starts to cry
Cries to stop
Can't be nice for the time that we've got
There's a kiss in the dark

Turn on
Turn away
Start love and celebrate
Tell me how
What's wrong
Happy times come down the phone

There's a kiss in the dark ...

Dreamsong
Somewhere
Listening in
Up there

Tell me how ...

There's a kiss in the dark ...

Happy now
I'm there
Take the wind its off again
have you the heart
to see Anymore you want of me

There's a kiss in the dark
