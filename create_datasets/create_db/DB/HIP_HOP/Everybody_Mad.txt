Yeah
They ain't gon' like you
They ain't gon' like me

I be getting to the money, everybody mad
I think I'm getting too much money, everybody mad
The same old nigga from the block
The same old nigga with the pot
The same old nigga from the trap
Everybody hated on him, then he bounced right back

I done spent a whole lotta time overseas
Doublin' my money 'cause you I want cheese
I been in my hometown playin' with the keys
When they fell off the boat, yeah I'm talking 'bout Belize
I know it's a whole lotta niggas that was hatin'
I know it's a whole lotta bitches that was taken
So I shut them niggas up, bitches feelin' us
Always knew that I was sick, so I had to stay patient
Takin' over summer nigga, tell me what's the bid?
Heard you still cuffin', nigga tell me what it is?
You ain't payin' no bills, buyin' no bags, buyin' no heels
God damn let a bitch live
All I see is 20's, 50's, 100's
If it ain't quarter mil', f*ck the whip I don't want it
'Bout to make these niggas sick to they stomach

I be getting to the money, everybody mad
I think I'm getting too much money, everybody mad
The same old nigga from the block
The same old nigga with the pot
The same old nigga from the trap
Everybody hated on him, then he bounced right back

She was acting stingy, now she wanna give it up
Fast life, O.T. I'ma live it up
Now my ex girl tryna make me jealous 'cause she got a new nigga
She don't know that I don't give a f*ck
I got me a deal but I'm still in the street
Heard a couple niggas talkin', let the guy be
They forgot sesame teriyaki sauce with the rice on the side
Swear these pussy niggas sweet
I got all this money on my motherfuckin' mind
Diamonds in my dial, I can't even see the time
All my niggas pull up, please don't ever bend the line
And they super extra when them niggas off the line
All I know is Bloods, Crips, Pirus
I'm a West Side nigga don't get it fucked up
Niggas sick 'cause they thought I lucked up

I be getting to the money, everybody mad
I think I'm getting too much money, everybody mad
The same old nigga from the block
The same old nigga with the pot
The same old nigga from the trap
Everybody hated on him, then he bounced right back

I be getting to the money, everybody mad
I think I'm getting too much money, everybody mad
The same old nigga from the block
The same old nigga with the pot
The same old nigga from the trap
Everybody hated on him, then he bounced right back
