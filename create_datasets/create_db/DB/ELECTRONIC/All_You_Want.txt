I'd like to watch you sleep at night,
To hear you breathe by my side
And although sleep leaves me behind,
There's nowhere I'd rather be
And now our bed is oh so cold,
My hands feel empty, no-one to hold
And I can sleep what side I want,
It's not the same with you gone
Oh if you'd come home, I'll let you know that

All you want, is right here in this room, all you want
And all you need, is sitting here with you, all you want
It's been three years, one night apart,
But in that night you tore my heart
If only you had slept alone,
If those seeds had not been sown
Oh you could come home and you would know that

All you want, is right here in this room, all you want
All you need is sitting here with you, all you want
I hear your key turning in the door,
I won't be hearing that sound anymore
And you and your sin can leave the way you just came in,
Send my regards to her
I hope you've found that

All you want, is right there in that room, all you want
All you need is sitting there with you, all you want
I'd like to watch you sleep at night,
To hear you breathe by my side.
