A cold December day.
I saw her on the highway
I said I'm headed west.
She said your going my way.
Then she got in with me.
Somewhere in Tennessee.
She snuggled up close to me.
She kissed me and then she said.

I want you to take me to my California Wine.
She said I got to get back where the bright sunshine.
And then she turned my head around like California wine.
And then she smiled at me and put her hand in mine.
And poured me a cup of wine, sweet California wine.

She said she thumbed all day.
Been in West Virginia.
She said I'll make a trade.
For all the love that's in ya.
I can sit and talk to you.
Share a cup of wine or two.
And I could be good to you.
She kissed me and then she said

I want you to take me to my California Wine.
She said I got to get back where the bright sunshine.
And then she turned my head around like California wine.
Then she smiled at me and put her hand in mine.
And poured another cup of wine, sweet California wine.

We chased a fading sun.
And watched the shadows falling.
And as we sipped the wine.
I heard California calling.
And she was good my dear.
And it became very clear.
I shifted into second gear.
I kissed her and then I said

I'm gonna take you to the California wine
I said we got to get back where the bright sunshine.
And then she turned my head around like California wine.
And then she smiled at me and put her hand in mine.
And poured another cup of wine, sweet California wine.
