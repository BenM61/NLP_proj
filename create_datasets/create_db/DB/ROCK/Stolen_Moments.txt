I used to drink a lot in those days you see
Ya, that's the way the wind blows
These days the only bar I ever see
Has got lettuce and tomatoes

I get pumped up in the back of my mind
Start thinking those days were the best of times
But I never look forward to looking back
Now I see a little daylight coming through the cracks

Don't you know we're living in stolen moments
You steal enough it feels like we're stopping time
These days are gold we're living in stolen moments
Just grab a hold

Well some guy told you that you couldn't dance
And you been carrying that forever
I'm the kinda fella needs a, a second chance
C'mon baby let's boo-ga-loo together

I see you over there just clinging to the wall
Cause they told you like ivy, you were born to crawl
But you kept looking up, girl, and I know why
Cause you knew some day you were gonna touch the sky

Baby, you know we're living in stolen moments
You steal enough it feels like we're stopping time
These days are gold we're living in stolen moments
Just grab a hold and feel your way
These days are yours and mine

Well, I couldn't dream this life I'm livin'
Somehow we just survived and every waste of time forgiven

Now I'm out in the backyard leaning on a tree
And I have no way of knowing
Can't lean too hard that's my philosophy
Man that tree is growing

Maybe I'll never grow up to be straight and tall
But you can lean on me, baby, I won't fall
Maybe in the deal I can learn to bend
Learn to listen like that tree, baby
Like a good friend

Well don't you know we're living in stolen moments
You steal enough it feels like we're stopping time
These days are gold we're living in stolen moments
Just grab hold and feel these days are yours and mine

Don't ya know we're living in stolen moments
You steal enough it feels like we're stopping time
These days are gold we're living in stolen moments
Just grab hold and feel your way
These days are yours and mine
