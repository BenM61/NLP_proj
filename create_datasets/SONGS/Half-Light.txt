Somewhere in the half-light
I could feel it coming true
I know it and I knew it
But I did it just for you
Baby, are you gettin' cold?
My room is just down the hall
And if we stay the night
I promise not to call

But somewhere in the half-light
I could feel it coming back
I get it, there's no future
But can't see it through the cracks
Baby, is the door unlocked?
Is your bed gettin' cold?
I know if I stay the night
You'll ask me to go

But somewhere in the half-light
I felt the mornin' comin' through
I know and I knew it
But can't see it, I refuse
Baby, all the lights came up
What are you gonna do?
Baby, all the lights came up
What are you gonna do?

Baby, all the lights came up
What are you gonna do?
Baby, all the lights came up
What are you gonna do?
Baby, all the lights came up
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna do?
Gonna do?

Baby, all the lights came up to illuminate the room
Blinded me, I shut my eyes to see an imprint there of you
I still think about it, but there was nothin' I could do
Baby, all the lights came down and illuminated you
Blinded me, I shut my eyes to see an imprint left of you
Blinded me, I shut my eyes, and there was nothin' I could do
