To be here with you alone beside me
Is to leave the world behind
To desire and to hold
To have longed for and be told

I see you, I see no one else at all
In my life, in my heart for evermore
Words of comfort, walls of sound
Unseen and secret, all around, all around

I never saw myself as one to stir or warm
Or believed this could ever be
But you are here you are real
You are all that I could wish

I see you, I see no one else at all
In my life, in my heart for evermore
Words of comfort, walls of sound
Unseen and secret, all around, all around

The stars are out in our world tonight
We can reach and touch them
Forever in their light

In the glare of cold and truthful morning
And not just in candlelight
You remain as the one
That I build my world upon

I see you, I see no one else at all
In my life, in my heart for evermore
Words of comfort, walls of sound
Unseen and secret, all around, walls of sound
