Ding, dong, ding, dong
Ding, dong, ding, dong

Hark how the bells, sweet silver bells
All seem to say, throw cares away
Christmas is here bringing good cheer
To young and old, meek and the bold

Ding, dong, ding, dong, that is their song
With joyful ring all caroling
One seems to hear words of good cheer
From everywhere filling the air

Oh, how they pound, raising the sound
O'er hill and dale, telling their tale
Gaily they ring while people sing
Songs of good cheer, Christmas is here

Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas
On, on they send, on without end
Their joyful tone to every home

Ding, dong, ding, dong
Ding, dong, ding, dong
Ding, dong, ding, dong

Oh, how they pound, raising the sound
O'er hill and dale, telling their tale

Ding, dong, joy to every home
Ding, dong, ding, dong
Ding, dong, ding, dong
Ding, dong, ding, dong

Hark how the bells, sweet silver bells
All seem to say, throw cares away
Christmas is here bringing good cheer
To young and old, meek and the bold

Ding, dong, ding, dong, that is their song
With joyful ring all caroling
One seems to hear words of good cheer
From everywhere filling the air

Oh, how they pound, raising the sound
O'er hill and dale, telling their tale
Gaily they ring while people sing
Songs of good cheer, Christmas is here

Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas
Merry Christmas

Their joyful tone to every home
Ding, dong, ding, dong
Joy to every home
