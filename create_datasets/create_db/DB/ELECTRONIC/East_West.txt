It's been a whole year since your call
The one that started
I don't love you anymore
I thought I'd surely not survive
But here I am, I'm still alive, 365 days later
Going strong, holding on
Trying to find a place where I belong
I've been east, I've been west
But I'm still not over you yet
I'm still not over you yet, no no
The weeks and months blend into one
A bleary haze, fall, winter
Now spring has begun
Bringing fresh hope to my door
I'll be the girl I was before you took back
The precious gift you gave to me
Going strong, holding on
Trying to find a place where I belong
I've been east, I've been west
But I'm still not over you yet
I'm still not over you yet, no no
And after all is said and done
And written up (written in the stars above)
The radio's singing songs of love
But not for us
Not for us
Going strong, holding on
Trying to find a place where I belong
I've been east, I've been west
But I'm still not over you yet
I'm still not over you yet, no no
East west, east west, 365
Here I am, I'm still alive
