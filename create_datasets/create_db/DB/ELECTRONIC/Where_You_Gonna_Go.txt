Willie Billie, Willie Billie Where you gonna go 
Say Willie Billie, Willie Billie Where you gonna go 
Willie Billie, Willie Billie Where you gonna go
When your bill is not playing playing 

Willie was a musical guy playing a nose that almost touched the sky 
He waited to go on an audition to play for Rednex 
But did he play well - no no no 
Did he rock the bill - no no no 

Willie Billie... 

Where you gonna go 
Where you gonna go Oh Willie 
Where you gonna go 
To play your giant nose 

When he was about to perform madly 
He caught a cold before badly 
And sprayed us like a waterfall sadly 
And said now I will - go go go
Me and my bill - go go go 

Willie Billie... 

Where you gonna go...
