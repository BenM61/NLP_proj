She picked up a friend
Cause she felt so alone
She thought up her ticket
And took a ride home
She cannot compare
To the bodies in the well
She needs to be mine
While I got her for a spell

Come on, come on
I've been waiting so long
Come on, come on
We need to be strong
Come on, come on
And make it so right
Come on, come on
And make it tonight

She was given a pink slip
And sent on her way
She was tired of giving
But life is what you make
So she made up a band aid
To heal all the wounds
She called out my name
Not a moment too soon

Come on, come on
I've been waiting so long
Come on, come on
We need to be strong
Come on, come on
And make it so right
Come on, come on
And make it tonight

Inspiration is everything
And we're all uninspired

Come on, come on
I've been waiting so long
Come on, come on
We need to be strong
Come on, come on
And make it so right
Come on, come on
And make it tonight

Come on, come on
And make it tonight
