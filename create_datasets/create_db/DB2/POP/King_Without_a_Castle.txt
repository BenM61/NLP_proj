Oh
Oh
Like a king without castle
Like a knight without a home
I call your name but there's no answer
And I'm left here on my own
Just wondering, wondering
Wondering, wondering, wondering
Where did our love go?

Does anybody know?

A man alone he has no future
A man alone he has no friends
There was a time I thought I found her
The one to love me 'til the end
Now I'm wondering, wondering
Wondering, wondering, wondering (wondering)
Where did our love go?

Does anybody know?

Does anybody know?
Wondering
Wondering
I'm like a king without castle
With a heart condemned to roam
I keep searchin' 'til I find you
'Til I do I'll be alone
Just wondering, wondering
Wondering, wondering, wondering
Where did our love go?

Does anybody know?

Anybody know?
Does anybody know?
Does anybody know?
Does anybody know?
Oh huh, yeah
