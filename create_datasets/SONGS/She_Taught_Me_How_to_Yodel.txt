I went across to Switzerland 
Where all the Yodellers be
To try to learn to yodel 
With my yodel-oh-ee-dee
I climbed a big high mountain 
On a clear and sunny day
And met a yodellin' gal 
Up in a little Swiss chalet

She taught me to yodel
Yodel-oh-ee-dee
Diddly-odel-oh-ee-dee
Diddly-odel-oh-ee-dee
She taught me to yodel
Yodel-oh-ee-dee-ay-dee
Yodel-oh-ee-dee-yodel-oh-dee

(more yodelling)

Well now I'm gonna teach you 
How to yodel just like me
It's easy when you're singin'
To go yodel-diddly-oh-oh-dee
First you take a deep breath
Then it's K.O. one, two, three
And then you'll hear a yodel 
If you listen close to me

Yeah, this is how to yodel
Yodel-oh-ee-dee
Diddly-odel-oh-ee-dee
Diddly-odel-oh-ee-dee
This is how to yodel
Yodel-oh-ee-dee
Diddly-odel-oh-ee-dee-yodel-oh-dee
