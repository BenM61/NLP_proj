I can't loose you now
We ain't got much time
In the silence of the room
Rivers from the wild
Rivers from the wild
Rivers run dry

Rivers from the wild
Rivers run dry
I can't stop this feeling
Just can't get enough for what you got
I can't stop this feeling
Just can't get enough for what you got

Running in your lust
Breathing in your dust
Stir me up from the inside 
We ain't got much time
Rivers from the wild
Rivers run dry

I can't stop this feeling
Just can't get enough for what you got

I can't stop this feeling
I just can't get enough for what you got

Rivers from the wild
Rivers run dry
Rivers from the wild
Rivers run dry
Rivers from the wild
Rivers run dry
Rivers from the wild
River run dry
