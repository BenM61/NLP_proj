The lights In the harbor
Don't shine for me
I'm like a lost ship adrift on the sea
Sea of heartbreak
Lost love and loneliness
Memories of your caress
So divine I wish you were mine
Again my dear
I am on this sea of tears
Sea of heartbreak

How did I lose you
Oh where did I fail
Why did you leave me
Always to sail

Oh what I'd give to sail back to shore
Back to your arms once more

Come to my rescue
Come here to me
Take me and keep me
Away from the sea
