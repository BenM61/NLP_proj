I once knew a pair that used to fit very tight
But now a man standing tall in the wake of this night
(na na na na na)
His eyes are watering in anger at the thought of her sight
(na na na na na)
The scene of adultery sets the stage for his plight 

On an innocent trip, how can one ruin so much
A belief in a soul, in a beauty, or in a touch
(ba ba bada ba)
It's like a three-legged dog in search of a crutch
(ba ba bada ba)
Dissecting in past all the motives of such 

She once loved this person in a trial out of sight
But disposing of their present situation, it felt right
(ba ba bada ba)
Two winters and summers passed over like a sound
(ba ba bada ba)
And now the two of them are lost in a screaming battleground 

With support all around him like a fence or a drink
He realises in sadness that now he must begin to think
(ba ba bada ba)
To filter his energy upon losses and fame
(ba ba bada ba)
She'll think of the restful, the peaceful or the gain

His sister's a friend, she's like a relative to both
Obliged through her brother under silhouetted oath
(ba ba bada ba)
But she's there for the two with her bias undone
(ba ba bada ba)
And she'll help see it through under moonlight or sun 

But today they've still yet to look each other in the eye
And in a second he manages to dip to the other side
(ba ba bada ba)
Up to the people of the sky
(ba ba bada ba)
And now he'll never die!
