Ooh...ooh...hoo...hoo...hoo...
When I called you at work today
Steadily comin home late
Tell me what am I supposed to do
If by chance I don't believe you

Now I may not have been the best
Tried so hard to communicate
Couldnt you talk to me
Now its too late

Where were you when I needed you
Did you get yourself lost in another girls arms
Where were you when I needed you
I'm afraid its too late to let you back into my heart

Oh-la-la-oh-la-oh
Oh-la-la-oh-la-oh (Oh, my poor heart)
Oh-la-la-oh-la-oh

If you really had cared for me
At least could have been discreet
I would have given my life for you
If you had given me the chance to

I heard you sing somebody a love song
I really thought I heard wrong
When I needed tender love and care
You were never there, never, never there

Where were you when I needed you
Did you get yourself lost in another girls arms
Where were you when I needed you
I'm afraid its too late to let you back into my heart, my heart, babe

Lifes too short, so baby, maybe we can be friends
Don't let your anger cloud you
But if we can't be together, we've got to talk to each other
If nothin else, think of the children, oh, of the children

Where were you when I needed you, whoa...oh...oh...
And hee...
Where were you when I needed you
Did you get yourself lost in another girls arms
Where were you when I needed you
I'm afraid its too late (Yeah) to let you come back to me (Oh, yeah)

Where were you when I needed you
Did you get yourself lost in another girls arms
Where were you when I needed you
I'm afraid its too late to let you come back to my heart

Where were you
