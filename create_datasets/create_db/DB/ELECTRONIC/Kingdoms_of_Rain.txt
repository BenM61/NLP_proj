Are those halos in your hair or diamonds shining there?
Without a hope, without a prayer
This rain beats down like death
Turn your eyes to better men

Before I go I'm hangin' a cross on a nail
I hung one for you in there

Girl, lay your shame to rest
And hold the lies close to your breast
You stoop to feed the crows
Some scraps of truth already cold

Before I go I'm hangin' a cross on a nail
I hung one for you in there
And every kingdom of rain comes pouring down
'Cause I loved you so long
'Cause I loved you so long

Would you put halos in your hair?
Without a hope, without a prayer
With lies close to your breast
You finally lay your shame to rest

Before I go I'm hangin' a cross on a nail
I hung one for you in there
And every kingdom of rain comes pouring down
'Cause I loved you so long
'Cause I loved you so long
