Now, my head is spinning
At the back of my mind, I think I'm winning
I was somebody falling for one who was not
Somebody tired of dreaming
Now its already dawning that this time I've got
Someone who won't leave me feeling...

Disappointed, once more
Disillusioned, encore
I think I love you, for sure
So you're not disappointing at all

Disenchanted, once more
Disillusioned, encore
I think I love you, for sure
So you're not disappointing at all

Listen, as you call my name
Just one syllable said, then spoken once again
From the sound of your voice, the promise you make
You're somebody I can believe in
Someone who won't leave me feeling...

Disappointed, once more
Disillusioned, encore
I think I love you, for sure
So you're not disappointing at all

Disenchanted, once more
Disillusioned, encore
I think I love you, for sure
So you're not disappointing at all

At the back of my head, I believe what you said
Dream...

Disappointed, once more
Disillusioned, encore
I think I love you, for sure
So you're not disappointing at all

Disenchanted, once more
Disillusioned, encore
I think I love you, for sure
So you're not disappointing at all

Disappointed...
