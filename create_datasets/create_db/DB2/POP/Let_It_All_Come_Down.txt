So let it all come, let it all come down
Let it all come, let it all come down
Sweet tears roll like a river from your eyes
Get close, let's sleep tonight

When you wake there's a new day dawning
When you wake there's a cold wind blowing
When day breaks there's a light shines through

I'm still here with you when the morning comes
I need you with me when the day begins

Oh let it all come, let it all come down
Why don't you let it all come, let it all come down

All is in control, love is on the open road
Make me want to live, you make me want to die

When you wake there's a new day dawning
When you wake there's a cold wind blowing
When day breaks there's a light shining through

Oh let it all come, let it all come down
