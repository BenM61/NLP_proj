Yes, indeed!


Yes, indeed!
	
Yes, indeed!

Get to  making with the jive, boy 
You'll shout when it hits you 
Yes indeed
Yes yes
Yes you'll shout when it hits you 
Yes indeed

When the spirit moves you you'll shout hallelujah
I mean 
When it it hits you you'll holler
Yes indeed
Yes yes

It comes out if it's in you, yes indeed
Yes indeed
Makes you shout, Jack, it sends you
Yes indeed
Well let me hit you

When the jive starts jumping you'll shout
Let me in there
Well all right now
When it hits you you'll holler
Yes indeed
Yes indeed
