Most people got soul if they want to try 
Let love be your goal and let it fly 
'Cause it's easy to hate and to draw a line
But error is human forgiveness is divine

I know a lot of people who think like me
That this world can be a place that's filled with harmony
First there's a lot of things we've got to rearrange
Put an end to hate and lies
So peace can come and truth shall reign
As long as there is a ray of hope

Lord, I don't mind going out and doin' my work
Light up the way to brotherhood
Help us to make His dream understood

Sometimes the road gets a little bit rough 
Your strength is all gone, you had enough
But there's people who win without making fists
Our world won't survive lest we think like this

I can't imagine any greater need
To treat each other as we'd like to be
It's a gas just knowing what is yet to come
Not unless we get together
Got to get together one by one

As long as there is a ray of hope
Lord, I don't mind goin out and doin my work
Light up the way to brotherhood
I got to keep on searchin, keep on searchin
'Til I find out 
Keep on searchin, keep on searchin
'Til I find out 
Keep on searchin, keep on searchin
'Til I find out 

Gonna take a little look way down inside
Gotta find out Lord, why I'm alive
We'll pray for a day when all men are free
And people can live like they're meant to be 
Meanwhile it's all up to you and me
Start working together towards this dream 

As long as there is a ray of hope
Lord, I don't mind goin out and doin my work
Light up the way to brotherhood
Help us to make His dream understood
As long as there is a ray of hope
I got to wait my turn 'til I can vote
As long as there is a ray of hope
