You are the reason why 
I feel the way I do now 
You've got to believe me can you hear me 
Cause I'm ready to show you how

We could fly so high yeah 
Baby baby don't deny (baby don't deny)

Baby believe me 
Cause I will be there (I'll be there) always 
I'll never let you down, never mess around 
Baby believe me 
Never before have I felt something more than I do 

If I told you a secret 
Would you turn and walk away 
(So good) So good, that baby you know what to say

Promises we made, never be afraid
