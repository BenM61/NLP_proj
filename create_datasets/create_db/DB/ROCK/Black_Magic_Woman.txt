Got a black magic woman
Got a black magic woman
I've got a black magic woman
Got me so blind I can't see
That she's a black magic woman
She's trying to make a devil out of me

Don't turn your back on me, baby
Don't turn your back on me, baby
Yes, don't turn your back on me, baby
Stop messing about with your tricks
Don't turn your back on me, baby
You just might pick up my magic sticks

You got your spell on me, baby
You got your spell on me, baby
Yes, you got your spell on me, baby
Turnin' my heart into stone
I need you so bad
Magic woman I can't leave you alone
