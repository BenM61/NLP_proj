I can't sleep at night
I'm aching for you to hold me tight
But you're nowhere in sight
So I toss and I turn and I wait for daylight
Are you thinking the same
Are you hearing my voice or saying my name
Who's the one here to blame
That we aren't here together
It's all about the groove
Oh baby it's all about the groove
It's all about the groove
I can't concentrate
I'm passing the point of control it's too late
Hate to hesitate
But I won't be the only one to crave
I'd take a chance with you
It'd be worth the pain if we didn't come through
We'd leave the city too
And just be together
It's all about the groove
Oh baby it's all about the groove
It's all about the groove 
There's something about you
I can't pin it down
Just needing more of it
Whatever we found
I felt a devotion
A commitment in time
Our groove was in motion
Me yours and you mine
