It doesn't matter if you're good or bad
It doesn't it it's driving you mad
I you're a looser if you're a star
Numbers will tell us what you are

All the figures figured out
That's all you need
Moneymaking's, all that counts
One thing is sure, it's not the quality

It's all about numbers
A matter of winning
No miracles or wonders
Is what life's bringing

It's all about numbers
That'll make the world go round
You don't care if you're telling the truth
It doesn't matter who will stand accused

To be the king on sacred ground
Numbers are all that count
Make it more sexual
It will raise the amount

Make yourself more flexible
Cold calculations is what it's about
It's all about numbers
A matter of winning

No miracles or wonders
Is what life's bringing
It's all about numbers
That'll make the world go round
