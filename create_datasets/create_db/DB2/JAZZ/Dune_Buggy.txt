Come with me for fun in my buggy
Come along let's go for the hell of it
See the faces round they're all looking
Wonder if they'd like to come for a ride.

I'll bet you anything now she's with me
There'll be no trouble
troubles around
Bet you'll never ever get away

Never ever get away
dune buggy.
See the world spin round in dune buggy
String along let's scram far out off the ground
Never felt so good she's a beauty

Bet she's a sight for your poor old eyes.

I'll bet you anything
boys on their bikes
Will have some trouble
following us

Bet they never ever catch us up
Never ever catch us up dune buggy.

I feel Iike a king in my buggy
Just the crown is missin' but that's alright
Come on people
come on my buggy
come and feel
The power of a starry night.

I'll bet you anything now she's with me
I feel like a king
I feel like a king in my buggy
