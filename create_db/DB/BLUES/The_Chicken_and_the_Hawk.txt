Well, a girly chicken fell in love with a chicken hawk
Well, a girly chicken fell in love with a chicken hawk
Fell head over heels for that hawk's sweet talk

She said take me up hawky, take me up in the sky
She said take me up hawky, take me up in the sky
I'm just a little bitty chicken and I don't know how to fly

[Chorus]
He said up, up, and away, we goin' fly all day
Up, up, and away, we goin' fly all day
Up, up, up, up, and away

He met a bald headed eagle flying up there in the blue
He met a bald headed eagle flying up there in the blue
Well the eagle told the hawk, I'm goin steal that chicken from you.

Well the hawk start flying like a P8 single jet
Well the hawk start flying like a P8 single jet
He said cool down chicken, the eagle ain't got us yet

[Chorus]

Well, you asked him for the sun, did you ask him for the moon
Well, you asked him for the sun, did you ask him for the moon
He said cool down, baby, we're going to be there soon.

[Chorus]
