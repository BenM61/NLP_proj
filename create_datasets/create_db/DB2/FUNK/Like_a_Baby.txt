Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, aah
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, aah

No, I cry and I cry and oh

Ooh yes, I am

I'm just a (Incomprehensible)
To be hurt like a baby
Ooh yes, I am

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, aah, ooh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, aah

Just like a baby, I'm just like a baby
I'm just like a baby, I'm just like a baby
Just like a baby
