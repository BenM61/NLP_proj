I know why you came
This time that we've borrowed
Imagine us now talking tomorrow

We're not very big
But we're certainly clever
To go on together
Well, what makes sense now?

Disgraceful, will we ever say no?

It's wine that we feel
That drives us together
This hormonal vision
That won't last forever

We're old enough now
And we should know better
To go on together
Well, what makes sense now

Disgraceful, will we ever say no?

This match that I'm burning
Two people still looking for something else
