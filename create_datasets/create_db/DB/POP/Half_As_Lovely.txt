If your eyes were half as bright, they still would light my way,
If your heart were twice as true then you'd be mine today.
That's why I often wish that you were half as lovely, twice as true,
I'm only one of those who thinks of you and sighs,

Just another who knows your laughter and lies.
I wish that you were someone who was half as lovely, twice as true.
I love you, I love you, too much it seems, for any fool can see,
With your heart so crowded with other dreams, how can you dream of me?

Though I pray the gods of love will make you care, somehow,
Still I know the odds of love are all against me now,
But I might stand a chance if you were half as lovely, twice as true.

Maybe, if your loveliness were not so heavenly,
Maybe then I might possess the only one for me,
I wish you ere someone who was half as lovely, twice as true.
