It's alright 
It's worth it
These little pieces I can't seem to align 
I need change 
And I just don't feel I was born to walk in a line 
I've been waiting to take my chances 
I can't live for the lie
I'll keep chasing 
'Cause I can feel something's gonna change 
The faster that we go 'round 
The tighter I'm holding 
I know that we fall down 
You and I are the same thing 
Simple yet we complicate the design 
It's working but I just feel there's a faster way to arrive 
I can taste it
And I want answers 
I can't live for the lie
I'll keep chasing 
'Cause I can feel something's gonna change 
The faster that we go 'round 
The tighter I'm holding 
I know that we fall down 
Part of me is still silently hoping 
Hold on, soon we'll be gone 
You will follow me one day 
In time, our time 

Are you ever big enough?
Is it easier in time? 
Turn the page and hurry up
Should I lead or stay in line? 
Is it all for the reward? 
Will it really be alright? 
Please don't leave me behind Hold on, soon we'll be gone 
You will follow me one day 

In time, when we divide And you walk further than me
Somehow I feel that the one last piece will align 
(I can feel) something's gonna change 
(I can feel) something's gonna change
