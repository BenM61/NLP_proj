When stars appear, I seem to hear a serenade 
I watch the moon, and then my tune is softly played
The music thrills and gently fills my heart with bliss
I hear the theme and want to dream and reminisce

I close my eyes 'neath the blanket of indigo skies
And my serenade sighs like a breeze from heaven above

Even at dawn, when the stars and the moonlight have gone
My refrain lingers on, like a memory of love

The love has flown, and I'm always alone
I'm not afraid

I'll always keep my dreamy, my sleepy serenade
I like to dream, a sleeping serenade and dream my life away
To a dreamy sleepy serenade
