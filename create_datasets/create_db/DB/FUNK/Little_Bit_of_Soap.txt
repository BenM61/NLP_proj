A little bit of soap will wash away your lipstick on my face
But a little bit of soap will never never never ever erase
The pain in my heart and my eyes as I go through the lonely years
A little bit of soap will never wash away my tears
Mmm, a little bit of soap will wash away your powder from my chin
A little bit of soap will never never never ever begin
To take away the hurt that I feel as I go through the lonely years
A little bit of soap will never wash away my tears, mmm, mmm, mmm
Have you heard when love begins to die it leaves someone to cry night and Day?
Like a bird, you left your robin's nest and-a just like all the rest you flew away
Mmm, a little bit of soap will take away your perfume eventually
But a little bit of soap will never wash away the memory
Of your name in the night that I call through the lonely years
A little bit of soap will never wash away my tears
I'll never lose the memory of your name in the night that I call through the lonely years
A little bit of soap will never wash away my tears
Mmm, a little bit of soap-a will never wash away my tears
Mmm, it's gonna never, never, never, uh-huh, wash away my tears
