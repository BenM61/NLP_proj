Hey hey do you wanna be famous
Everywhere you go, people know what your name is
Everyone you know, tryin' to tell you you changin'
They wanna taste that
Fame that fame that fame that fame that fame

Famous, everybody wanna be famous
Most people wanna just taste it
Other people trynna just sneak in the v.i.p 
And chill with the big faces
They don't really see them changes,
When the fame hits
When I'm up on the stage 
They sing it as soon as I step up they hate it
And I'm saying I really ain't 
With that complaining 
Just look at the picture I'm painting
Yeah I pay my rent, 
Vacation then,
Take trips all around the equator then
Come back to the A hit the stage again,
Then I go up in the booth where they caged me in,
Feel regular but then I go insane again
If you witnessed the condition that my brain is in 
You would see me in hell where Satan is,
All I'm saying to do is to maintain a friend 
Cause everybody tryna get paid from me 
But f*ck it 
This is the entertainment biz 
So let the games begin 
I mean let the flames begin 
But hey I'm just trained to this
A lot of everybody didn't get paid from this 
I'm famous

Hey hey do you wanna be famous
Everywhere you go, people know what your name is
Everyone you know, tryin' to tell you you changin'
They wanna taste that
Fame that fame that fame that fame that fame

Popular, everybody wanna be popular
Lil' kids just be watchin' us through binoculars 
And then they go to school and copy us
But hey I'm not knockin' ya
But how can y'all not see it's obvious
Cause cops just be plottin' on us
And paparazzi be spottin' us
Cause everybody just wanna be on M-T-V or B-E-T or
Maybe season M-V-P or maybe even just bumpin' the queen
But everybody can't be a G O to the D
And everybody can't be O to the B,
But I don't know maybe this is just how it's supposed to be
But this is what'll happen to y'all
You can go  crazy and beat up trucks
The tabloids sayin' that you're hooked on drugs
You cuttin' up your face and then sew it back up
But look its plain to see,
Ain't nothin' in this games gon' be changin' me
I'm a always be O to the B, me me me
