I've got a telegraph in my hand.
Words on paper, written in sand.

We've got telegraph, right across this land.
It doesn't mean a damn thing.
We don't understand.
But who needs telegraph anyway?

I've got a telegraph in my hand.
Words on paper, written in sand.

We've got telegraph, right across this land.
It doesn't mean a damn thing.
We don't understand, we never understand!

God's got a telegraph on his side.
It makes Him powerful, gives Him pride.
Even in America, God bless America!
They understand the value of the telegraph.
Hand in hand, hand in hand...
