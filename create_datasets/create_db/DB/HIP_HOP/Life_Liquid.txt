Blood spillin' in the streets, the what?
Blood spillin' in the streets
Blood spillin' in the streets, the what?
Blood spillin' in the streets

Aiyyo wit two precise niggaz, holdin' the right biscuits
There'll be a lot of cats leakin' out they life liquid
Niggaz who actin' hard this ain't Columbia Pictures
When we throw two in yo' ass while you huggin' on your mistress

From Philly, where cats quick to mute you at
Cuckoo cats, twist back your FUBU cap
Crucial black, two chicks to screw you at
Then they shove a pool stick where you doodoo at

While you checkin' on your pagers, weapons in your faces
Shot blazin', cops section off the pavement
Hoppin' out with gauges, prepare for the occasion
We throw about eight in, the house that you was raised in

Mouthin' off fakin'll make you a loud patient
Achin', with your arms in a alcohol basin
And while your brain's achin' I'ma have your dame slavin'
Cocaine and apron, over a flame bakin'

Niggaz take it for granted until they layin' dead on the granite
Innocent bystanders get shot by standin'
Y'all better duck when you hear the cannon or y'all be checkin' for leaks
Niggas'll leave your blood spillin' in the streets

Niggaz take it for granted until they layin' dead on the granite
Innocent bystanders get shot by standin'
Y'all shoulda ducked when y'all heard the cannon, now you layin' deceased
Niggas'll leave your blood spillin' in the streets

Can you feel it? Nothin' can save ya
'Cause this is the season of the infrared laser
And since I got time, what I'm gonna do
Is show you how you can get spotted by one too

'Cause I don't give a f*ck, I just cock back and bust
With more arms than an octopus, as if one gun wasn't enough
I f*ck around and pull eight out
Blast your face off or blow your brains out
Nigga, I'll leave you laid out

Then I pull the gat in my waist out, put it in your mouth
And keep squeezin' 'til the whole clip is sprayed out
Take the gun in my ankle brace out, shoot you in the stomach
Till I see the last meal you ate drain out

Your face look spaced out, I gut you like a trout
Scream my name out while I'm scrapin' your rib cage out
Squeeze with the index, spray like a bottle of Windex
Bullets buzzin' by your head like insects

From your head to your mid-sec'
And I ain't even shoot you in the legs or your limbs or your dick yet
Your masculinity is questionable, you probably a homosexual
Just the thought of havin' a woman lay next to you probably threatens you

You probably look at grapes and see testicles
You probably fantasize about vegetables
Like cucumbers and bananas havin' sex with you
And you probably let gerbils crawl up your rectum too

Shame on you, I defecate on you and simultaneously urinate on you
And pour some acid rain on you
I stop your heartbeat with heat
You weak nigga, I'll leave your blood spillin' in the street

Niggaz take it for granted until they layin' dead on the granite
Innocent bystanders get shot by standin'
Y'all better duck when you hear the cannon or y'all be checkin' for leaks
Niggas'll leave your blood spillin' in the streets

Niggaz take it for granted until they layin' dead on the granite
Innocent bystanders get shot by standin'
Y'all shoulda ducked when y'all heard the cannon, now you layin' deceased
Niggas'll leave your blood spillin' in the streets

Ayyo Journalist what you workin' with?
Old school burners with
Barrels big enough for you head to fit in the circle shit
What you holdin' Canibus?

30 bullet banana clips
Just to handle the kick I gotta glue it to my hands and shit
We got permits to murder shit
We critically injure niggaz who deserve the shit, put 'em in a tourniquet

Bomb proof Suburbans with tractor-tread tires
So we can ride through the dirt with it, drive over curbs with it
Merc in it, even over slippery surfaces we can swerve in it
And crash into niggaz who don't deserve they shit
Try stoppin' the dudes, you gotta be bruised
Cockin' the tools that knock you out your socks and your shoes

We'll leave you shoe less and keep shootin'
Look how much life liquid you losin', you need a blood transfusion
In the back of a medic truck, shots in your neck and gut
While we holdin' our weapons up, I'm still reppin' Philly, what?

Blood spillin' in the streets, the what?
Blood spillin' in the streets
Blood spillin' in the streets, the what?
Blood spillin' in the streets

Niggaz take it for granted until they layin' dead on the granite
Innocent bystanders get shot by standin'
(The what?)
Y'all better duck when you hear the cannon or y'all be checkin' for leaks
(The what?)
Niggas'll leave your blood spillin' in the streets

The what?
The what?
