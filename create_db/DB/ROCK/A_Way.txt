We're in love,let's be together
Happy times or heavy weather
Mother says, "today's a special day"
So let's not fight, okay, yeah

When you were at school you were a honey
The boys all loved you, you loved the money
The boys would stare, you'd cross your legs
And then you'd toss your hair

Away
Yes you get by
Away

Money's scarce, but family honor
Brings it home brings it home
And down the shop, the tongues they snicker
TV dinners, beer and liquor...oh yeah

Skeletons fall out of cupboards
Curtains drawn fall open to allow
The light shows up the dust
That plays around your face

[Chorus:]
Innocence and lies don't make a perfect match
Leave your door unlatched
I know a word can be untrue
And yet still move you

All the time they bring their friends 'round
Dress you up, show you up
And all the time they told you it was true
Well I'll believe you now

But then I just don't know I
Think I have to reconsider, yeah
I know when she got married
She looked fine in white and lacy frills
Oh yeah, she had a baby
It was painful, it was worth it
And all the time they stuck the knife in
Pulled it up and twist it around

[Chorus]
Innocence and lies don't make a perfect match
Leave your door unlatched
I know a word can be untrue
And yet still move you

Well that's fine, fine, fine
