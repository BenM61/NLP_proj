You see, see rider, see what you done, done
See, see rider, you see what you done, done
You see, see rider, you see what you done, done
You don't made me love you and now your man don't come

My home is on the water, I don't like no land at all
Home's on the water and I don't like no land at all
My home's on the water and I don't like no land at all
I'd rather be dead than to stay here and be your dog

So you see, see rider, see what you done, done
See, see rider, you see what you done, done
You see, see rider, you see what you done, done
You've made me love you and now your man don't come

I'm goin' away babe, sure don't wanna go
Goin' away babe, but I sure don't wanna go
I'm goin' away babe, but I sure don't wanna go
When I'm leave you this time you'll never see me no more

So you see, see rider, see what you done, done
See, see rider, you see what you done, done
You see, see rider, you see what you done, done
You've made me love you and now your man don't come

My home's on the water and I don't like no land at all
Home's on the water and I don't like no land at all
My home's on the water and I don't like no land at all
So goodbye baby, I'm tired of being your dog
