In air so hot and sweet
We heard it in the breeze
Metallic shimmering 
Of invisible things

Will we ever have our own house?
Will we ever be in one place long?
Long enough to know all the sounds
To at least know our way around?

When you said that you'd love me better
With every passing day
How could that go on forever
When I'm different everyday

In air so hot and sweet 
We heard it in the breeze
Metallic simmering 
Of invisible things
