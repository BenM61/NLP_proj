I never felt like this before
Try to hold it back and I feel it even more
Sweat drips down my spine and my knees are weak
I can not move, I can not speak

But then you came and I held it together again
I managed to stumble through
Fifty thousand voices singing in the rain
There's nothing that I wouldn't do

'Cause I'd move mountains if you asked me to
I'd swim the seven seas
I'll be the one to hold your torch again
I'll do anything you ask of me

'Cause I'd move mountains if you asked me to
I'd swim the seven seas
I'll be the one to hold your torch again
I'll do anything you ask of me

I never knew how proud I would feel
Just standing in the rain.
These three words mean everything to me
And I'd sing it again and again.

'Cause I'd move mountains if you asked me to
I'd swim the seven seas
I'll be the one to hold your torch again
I'll do anything you ask of me

'Cause I'd move mountains if you asked me to
I'd swim the seven seas
I'll be the one to hold your torch again
I'll do anything you ask of me

Well the blue and the white of the flag shines bright
And it's blowing there for me.
With my hand on my heart, the honest truth
There's nowhere I'd rather be.

'Cause I'd move mountains if you asked me to
I'd swim the seven seas
I'll be the one to hold your torch again
I'll do anything you ask of me

'Cause I'd move mountains if you asked me to
I'd swim the seven seas
I'll be the one to hold your torch again
I'll do anything you ask of me
