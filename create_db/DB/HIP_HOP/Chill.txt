Chill... 
Yeaaaa  hahahaha 
(Erick Sermon) 
Equip wit the rap microchip 
Program  aptitude  one mo return  oh      
My face in the magazines  showing my eyes green 
(Chill...) Chill  fresh new dip when I'm seen 
Yo  dig  it's the new fig for the E Double 
I pack a Mac 10 just in case of trouble 
Hot like the handle on a pot  I'm steaming 
Fame and more glory than Morgan Freeman 
I'm the original  my style's deformed 
So it can sound crazy ill when I perform 
Yea, check 1, 2, mic supreme 
EPMD, the rap American Dream Team 
The E-Double's definitely no joke 
You can't see me, even wit the microphone 
I'm massive dope, funky, who's deffer 
Yo, when I express myself like Salt 'N Pepa 
Erick Sermon and Parrish Smith 
The sickest, the wickest, crazy mad psycho, the slickest 
Hardcore rhymin, yea, that's the ticket 
Buckwhylin, ruff enuff for Long Island 
Chill.... Yeaaaaaa, Hahahaha.... 
Ruff enuff to rock New York to Long Island 
(PMD) 
Back up, boy, move easy wit the hand motion 
Don't even blink, kid, or I'ma start smoking 
The glock hammer's cocked wit the speed jock 
12 shots, the bust target is the brown fox 
So call me smooth talk rhyme, jaywalk wit the slang talk 
be	-boy fanatic, straight from New York 
The foundation, landmark of the rap scene 
EPMD in effect, I'm clocking mad green 
Like Kermit the Frog, sloppy like Boss Hog 
Girls runnin wild, ?paid tho' like a klondar? 
For mics are ready to flow in slow mo' 
Know the rap game just like Bo knows hoes 
(Yeaaaa, hahahaha)Hard, you get scarred, messing wit the Hit Squad 
Slide easy or catch a bullshucks charge 
No time to ill, stay mental or puff a pill 
Get the macadamians, and, oh, yea, kid, chill 
Chill.... Yeaaaa, hahahaha.... 
Ruff enuff to rock New York to Long Island....
