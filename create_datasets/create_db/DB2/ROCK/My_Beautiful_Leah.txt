Did you see her walking? 
Did she come around here, Sir? 
Black hair, brown eyes 
My beautiful Leah 
She was always so needing 

Said, "I have no-one" 
Even as I held her 
She went out looking for someone 
She only had nightmares, 
And her sadness never lifted 
And slowly over the years 
Her lovely face twisted 
Did she come around here, Sir? 
I swear you would remember 
Black hair, Brown eyes 

Late September 
October 
November 
December 
It never leaves my mind 
The last words she said 
"If I don't find it this time, 
Then I'm better off dead".
