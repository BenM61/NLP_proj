Boys and girls the new generation 
Call it generation of love 
Boys and girls the new generation 
Call it generation of love 
Give me all your loving, give me all your loving 
Give me all your loving, make it true 
Give me all your loving, give me all your loving 
Give me all your loving, me to you 

Boys and girls jump up and down 
Move your body round and round 
Pump the bass up in this place 
Put a smile back in your face 
Take control, don't waste time 
The heat is on you're feeling fine 
Feel the power from above 
Call it generation of love 

Here I go, here I go, kiss me 
Baby let it flow 
You know how to make it right 
Light my fire, hold me tight 
People of the night keep grooving 
Got to get it right you're moving 
Feel the power from above 
Call it generation of love 

Everybody's feeling happy, 
Everybody everywhere 
Everybody's feeling happy, 
Everybody everywhere
