Heart, beating strong
I was serious my love was furious
For you, only you, oh babe
Darling I don't know why
Can't leave you alone
You thrill me to the bone
You're the one
Obsession oh babe

Don't you know it was a crucial lovin'
Cru-cial
Crucial lovin'
Cru-cial

Chills, over me
Different from the rest
I won't settle for less
Hello, won't take no oh babe

From now on you and I
Stood the test of time
Still you're on my mind
Always, night and day oh babe

Don't you know it was a crucial lovin'
Cru-cial
Crucial lovin'
Cru-cial

I have more than told you
Girl I've got to show you
Feelings over load extreme

For the very first time
Girl you are my last time
You have taken over me
