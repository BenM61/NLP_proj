Hey  baby 
What do you do 
When I'm not there 
Question been on my mind 
Letting you know I'm coming 
But before I get there 
Tell me  do you 
Do you play the music low 
And burn your candles 
Do you touch yourself 
Pretending that you're me 
Do you think of me 
With toys and things inside you 
Do you wish your hands 
Were my hand 
Making you scream 
Oh baby 
Do you 
Do you think of me 
Do you wish I was there 
Killing you softly 
Do you 
Do you 
Do you 

Do you still close your eyes 
Every night and fantasize 
Baby tell me 
Do you 
Do you lick your lips 
Remembering how it tasted 
Do you miss the tender 
Kisses down below 
Do your fingers do the walking 
When you hear our favorite 
Song again 
I want to know 
How do you please yourself 
When you're all alone 


Tell me what do you do 
When I'm not there 
Do you massage your own body 
Do you wash your own hair 
Do you caress your own thighs 
Do you
