Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
I found myself looking into the mirror 
Knew I wasn't who I wanted to be 
I was living like the way that I wanted 
But my eyes reminded me I'm not free. 
Believed a lie so, everything that I know 
Says I got to go, tired of going solo 
But I'm never gonna go there again. 

This is what it is 
This is who I am 
This is where I finally take my stand 
I didn't want to fall 
But I don't have to crawl 
I met the One with two scarred hands 
Giving him the best of everything that's left of 
The life inside this man 
I've been born again (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I see you walking like your living in fear 
Having trouble even looking at me 
Wishin' they would give you more than words 
Sick of people telling how it should be (How it should be) 
What's your download, where'd you get your info, 
You saw that I'm show now your in the inload 
Gonna tell you what I believe 

This is what it is 
This is who I am 
This is where I finally take my stand 
I didn't want to fall 
But I don't have to crawl 
I met the One with two scarred hands 
Giving him the best of everything that's left of 
The life inside this man 
I've been born again (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

We are the ones they call by name 
(I'm never gonna look back) 
Let go let go the guilt the shame 
(Said I'm never gonna look back) 
This is who I am 

This is what it is 
This is who I am 
This is where I finally take my stand 
I didn't want to fall 
But I don't have to crawl 
I met the One with two scarred hands 
Giving him the best of everything that's left of 
The life inside this man 
I've been born again (This is what it is)

(This is who I am)
(I didn't want to fall)
(But I don't have to crawl)
I met the One with two scarred hands 
Giving him the best of everything that's left of 
The life inside this man 
I've been born again 
I've been born again
