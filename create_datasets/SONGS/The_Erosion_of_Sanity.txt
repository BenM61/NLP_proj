Man's sanity has not provided
For an imminent derangement
Life won't be able to handle
The psychological sickness

Encephalitis' treatments are unknown
In a perpetual sleep, they're swallowed

A decrease in all capacities
Mentally you're becoming obsolete
Infection in your brain, it creates
A slumber that no one can awake

Nailed in your chair, you're living dismally

Sudden rise of lucidity
Your wretched life is complete
As before, now you can see
Walk and talk normally

How long will i be
Saved from my disease?

Unexpected relapse into sickness
Brought you back to an everlasting sleep

Back in your chair, you're living dismally
