I will rock you like a baby
Love will cradle in my arms
I'll keep you safe from danger
Shelter you from harm

There will never be another
That treats you like I do
We can drift into forever
On a love that's made for two

Don't you ever say this love's not special
Don't you ever think it's not essential
Baby

I was only thinking of you
Hoping you were thinking of me
Two hearts beating just like one
Against the world
I am always dreaming of you
Hoping you are dreaming of me
I could never live one day without your love

I will kiss you like an angel, baby
Cradled in my wings
I will take you up to heaven
Show you precious things

If you promise that you love me
If you promise that you care
I will be here for always and forever
This I swear

Don't you ever say this love's not special
Don't you ever think it's not essential
Baby

I was only thinking of you
Hoping you were thinking of me
Two hearts beating just like one 
Against the world
I am always dreaming of you
Hoping you were dreaming of me
I could never live one day without your love

Now you say you want to love
But, you don't think you believe it
Just open up your heart
And you know you will receive it
Oh baby

Don't you ever say this love's not special, no
Don't you ever think it's not essential

I was only thinking of you
Hoping you were thinking of me
Two hearts beating like one
Against the world
I am always dreaming of you
Hoping you were dreaming of me
I could never live one day without your love

I was only, I was only
I was only, I was only
I was only, I was only

I was only thinking, oh baby
