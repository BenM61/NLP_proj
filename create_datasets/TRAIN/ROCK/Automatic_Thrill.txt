Automatic thrill come
Come and get me in my sleep
Automatic thrill come
Come and get me in my sleep

Make a stain upon the sheet
Got me smelling sweet
Make a stain upon the sheet
Got me smelling sweet

Dark blue movie on the inner screen
Depravated plot got me feeling so mean
Big bad cast and they come in all shapes
Automatic thrill when I pull the drapes

Got me runnin' down an alley
Full of hate and melancholy
Got me suckin' on a bitter pill
Sucker for the big kill
Automatic thrill

I've been a GI fighting
On the front line, yeah
Been on airports
Lookin' for the right sign, yeah

I have been with sisters I have been with moms
I've had blisters all over my palms
I have given life, I have made the kill
Got myself addicted to the automatic thrill
Automatic thrill, automatic thrill

Make a cut to the place
Where I get to see that gory face
Add a helicopter noise add some freaky lookin' boys
Get it runnin' drag me in and put the spittle on my chin

Girlfriends makin' out in prison cells
Hunchback creep and he's bangin' on the bells
Big black dog sittin' at my door
Automatic thrill and I want it some more

Add a helicopter noise add some freaky lookin' boys
Get it runnin' drag me in and put the spittle on my chin
Got me runnin' down an alley, full of hate and melancholy
Got me suckin' on a bitter pill, sucker for the big kill

Automatic thrill, got me suckin' on the pill
Automatic thrill, got me suckin' on the pill
Automatic thrill, got me suckin' on the pill
Automatic thrill, got me suckin' on the pill
