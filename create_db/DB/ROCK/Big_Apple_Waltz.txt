Manhattan Skyline, surrounds me
Just like a lady, you're holding your
Light burning for me to see
Cause I'd do anything most anything
for all those nights that you bring to me

All of our love
I've been so long
In the city
The city has been
So long inside of me
It's so long, it's a pity, I'm so far away
But I still do
The Big Apple Waltz

I find an empire, in any state
Building the future, around you 'cause
Where love grows, it's never too late
We'll paint a heart, on the wall
For the whole of the world to see

Loving you, is feeling
of deja-vu
Loving you, I know it's true
Oh yeah, we'll paint a heart, on the wall
For the whole of the world to see

I've been so long, in the city
The city has been, so long inside of me
