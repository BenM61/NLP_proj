I care about you baby, baby
More than you'll ever know
More than you'll ever know
Please do not drive me crazy, crazy
Unless you're gonna go
With me

No pressure
No pressure, I know you're real
The pressure
The pressure will make you feel

Up till the sun rises
There's no compromising
I know, I know, I know
You are such a liar
I never denied you
I was for sure
But it's really out of my control
The way you feel is not my problem
I don't wanna see you go
But I don't have time to solve this
And you don't have the right
After all you put me through
I'm starting to realise

Pressure
The pressure I know you feel
Pressure
The pressure just keep it real

Major weed smoke in the air
Pass it like you just don't care
Have you seen my fucks to give?
I have none, I cannot live with

The pressure
The pressure you know I feel
The pressure
The pressure to keep it real

Pay attention to the signs
Stay and listen, you will find
Everything, ain't rocket science
Every gem is not a diamond

But the pressure
The pressure will make you feel
The pressure
The pressure

The pressure will make you feel
