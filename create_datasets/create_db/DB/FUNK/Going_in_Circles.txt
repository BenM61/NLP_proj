Going in circles, don't really know
Where I have come from, where I will go
You say that you love me, and maybe you do
There's nothing that matters or anything new

I've been through a million trips in the night
Living with shadows, looking for light
And passing the faces, how lonely they seem
Looking for traces of yesterdays dream

Going in circles, been here before
Never expected anything more
Might die tomorrow, I might go to Spain
Dumb to the sorrow, numb to the pain

Circles.
Going in circles.
Circles.
