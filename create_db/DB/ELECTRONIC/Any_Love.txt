You go out every night as a single
But you don't really know what to do
You see someone you'd just like to mingle
And you imagine she's waiting for you

Any love
Any love that you feel is for real
And each time that you use love
You're gonna lose love

Any love
Love, love
Love, sweet love
Any love
Love, love
Love, sweet love

There is no certain crowd that you run with
Throw your passion away let me run with
He says hi she says hi and I'm done with
Though you never belong I'm waiting to see
Any love that you feel is for real
And each time that you use love
You're gonna lose love

Any love
Love, love
Love, sweet love
Any love
Any love
Love, love
Love, sweet love

You go out every night as a single
But you don't really know what to do
You see someone you'd just like to mingle
And imagine that she is waiting for you
She's waiting, waiting for you
Is waiting for you
Waiting for you

Any love
Love, love
Love, sweet love
