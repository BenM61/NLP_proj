When you're needing rest from the road
I will bring you in from the cold
When your wildest dreams wash away
I will rescue you from the waves

When you lose, when you rush
When you don't feel strong enough
Everybody needs a pick me up
You can count on me
Come what may come what might
Everybody falls down sometimes
Don't lose hope it'll be alright
You can count on me
Yeah, you can count on me

When you're feeling all alone
I will carry you back home

When you lose when you rush
When you don't feel strong enough
Everybody needs a pick me up
You can count on me
Come what may come what might
Everybody falls down sometimes
Don't lose hope it'll be alright
You can count on me
Yeah, you can count on me

When you lose when you rush
When you don't feel strong enough
Everybody needs a pick me up
You can count on me
Yeah, you can count on me
