I want to love you 
Like I've never loved you tonight 
If it's alright 
I want to tell you things I've never said 
In my life 
I'm gonna hold you when the sun refuses to shine, yeah 
I want to show you that I'll always be by your side, oh 

[Chorus:]
When you call my name 
And you need me there 
Girl you know 
That I will be waiting for you 
When you close your eyes 
And you see me there 
Don't you know 
That I will be waiting 

I want to kiss you like 
I'll never kiss you again 
If it's okay 
I can't imagine loving any other this way, whoa 

[Chorus x2]
When you call my name 
And you need me there 
Girl you know 
That I will be waiting for you 
When you close your eyes 
And you see me there 
Don't you know 
That I will be waiting 

So what ya want to do? 
I want to be with you 
I know you like my style 
So why don't you stay a while 
And when you want me to 
I'll wait for you 

[Chorus x2]
When you call my name 
And you need me there 
Girl you know 
That I will be waiting for you 
When you close your eyes 
And you see me there 
Don't you know 
That I will be waiting 

You'll call my name and I'll be there 
You'll call my name babe 
Oh ooh oh yeah, yeah, yeah 
Call my name yeah
