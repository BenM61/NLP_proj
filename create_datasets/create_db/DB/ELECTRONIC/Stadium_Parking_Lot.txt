Gonna make enough noise to wake the dead!
It's going out of my head
Back from the land that time forgot
There's a party in the stadium parking lot
Come on
And there's a party goin' on
I can hear it goin' on
And there's a party goin' on
Bring it on!

Turnin' up the heat again
Come on
Gonna make enough noise to wake the dead!
I can hear it right now
It's going out of my head
Back from the land that time forgot
There's a party in the stadium parking lot
There's a party goin' on, party goin' on
I can hear it goin' on, party goin' on
There's a party goin' on
Bring it on!

Bring it on!

Turnin' up the heat again
Come on

There's a party in the stadium parking lot
There's a party goin' on, party goin' on
I can hear it goin' on, party goin' on
There's a party goin' on
Bring it on!
There's a party in the stadium parking lot
