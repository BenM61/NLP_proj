It only takes a minute girl 
It only takes a minute girl 
To fall in love, to fall in love 
It only takes a minute girl 
To fall in love, to fall in love 

What's an hour of the day 
We throw at least one away 
And walk the streets for half the year 
To try to find a new career 
If you get a flu attack 
For thirty days you're on your back 
Doing not a single dance 
Baby give me half a chance 

It only takes a minute girl (only takes a minute girl)
To fall in love, to fall in love (to fall in love)
It only takes a minute girl (it only takes a minute girl)
To fall in love, to fall in love 

Now in the unemployment lines 
You can spend your life reading signs 
Waiting for your interview 
They can shoot the whole day for you 

Now winter's gonna turn to spring 
And you haven't accomplished a thing 
So baby can't you make me just a little time 
'Cause you never know what's on my mind 

It only takes a minute girl (only takes a minute girl)
To fall in love, to fall in love (to fall in love)
It only takes a minute girl (it only takes a minute girl)
To fall in love, to fall in love 

It only takes a minute girl (that's one minute)
To fall in love (to fall in love, to fall in love (to fall in love)
It only takes a minute girl (just one minute )
To fall in love, to fall in love (to fall in love)

Alright let's go
Dance, come on now 
Dance
Dance, come on now

Dance, come on now
Dance
Dance, come on now
