Can I get your hand to write on
Just a piece of leg to bite on
What a night to fly my kite on
Do you want to flash your light on

Take a look
It's on display for you
Coming down
No, not today

Did you meet your fortune teller
Get it off with no propeller
Do it up, it's on with Stella
What a way to finally smell her

Pick it up
If not too strong for you
Take a piece
And pass it on

Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together

Fly on my wind
Rebel and a liberator
Find a way to be a skater
Rev it up to levitate her
Super friendly aviator

Take a look
It's on display for you
Coming down
No, not today

Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together

In the water where I center my emotion
All the world can pass me by
Fly away on my zephyr
We'll find a place together

(Whoa) whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa - do you
(Yeah) yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Whoa) whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa - want to
(Yeah) yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together

In the water where I center my emotion
All the world can pass me by
Fly away on my zephyr
We're gonna live forever

Forever
