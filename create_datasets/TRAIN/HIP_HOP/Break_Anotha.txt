Baby girl like cinnamon,
Hot for the skin he's in,
Oops makes you wanna sin again,
Defenses start to break,
It's more than you can take,
Wanna get'cha get'cha than your heart'll break

He's got no shame,
He's got no name,
And ya baby start to wonder,
What's in store,
What the hell,
That spell that he got you under,

Playing a role he don't care what he's doing,
He's a gentleman, a lover, get you undercover,
You try to prove that his love is for you,
Just when you think he's changed his tune,

He'll break anotha, he'll break anotha, he'll break anotha
Break anotha heart babe
He'll break anotha, he'll break anotha, he'll break anotha
Break your heart babe
He'll break anotha, he'll break anotha, he'll break anotha
Break anotha heart babe
He'll break anotha, he'll break anotha, he'll break anotha
Break your heart babe

Stop,
Before you jump,
He'll switch it like a punk,
Wanna bump bump than you're looking dumped,
Dear God not me,
Make you wanna thump,
Leave you for a night,
Make you feel like a, like a chump,
So desperate,
Be your best friend,

Sign you up just to cross you off his checklist,
One more victim,
Don't test it,
Don't you want something more you can invest in,

Playing a role he don't care what he's doing,
He's a gentleman, a lover, get you undercover,
You try to prove that his love is for you,
Just when you think he's changed his tune,

He'll break anotha, he'll break anotha, he'll break anotha
Break anotha heart babe
He'll break anotha, he'll break anotha, he'll break anotha
Break your heart babe
He'll break anotha, he'll break anotha, he'll break anotha
Break anotha heart babe
He'll break anotha, he'll break anotha, he'll break anotha
Break your heart babe

Break!
Hey! Hey! B-break!
S-s-sory babe but somethings coming over me,
It's like t-two sides of me,
I try ta try ta be good but I don't wanna be,
But you could, you could, you could be a friend to me,

He'll break anotha, he'll break anotha, he'll break anotha
Break anotha heart babe

He'll break anotha, he'll break anotha, he'll break anotha
Break anotha heart babe
He'll break anotha, he'll break anotha, he'll break anotha
Break your heart babe
He'll break anotha, he'll break anotha, he'll break anotha
Break anotha heart babe
He'll break anotha, he'll break anotha, he'll break anotha
Break your heart babe
