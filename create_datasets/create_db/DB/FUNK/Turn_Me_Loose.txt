I called you yesterday
Your too busy to have a conversation
I'm trying hard to hold on to us but
Seems like you don't wanna stay

So tell me why
Is it someone takin' my time
Tell me what the truth is
I don't wanna do this
Ain't no use in trying to stay
If you gone turn me loose

If you gone turn me loose 
If you gone turn me loose 

Well you use to be sweet to me
Now it feels like a bad situation
You said you loved but you have changed
I'm tired of runnin'
Runnin' after you
So now I'm gone get my thangs and walk out the door
(I don't wanna hear it)
I know what the truth is
I ain't tryna do this
Ain't no use in tryin to stay
If you gone turn me loose

Baby yeah
If you gone turn me loose
Why should I stay?
You need to let me go baby
Turn me loose
Somebody gone want me
Gotta let you go
Gotta let you go
Gotta let you go

So now, I'm gone get my thangs and walk out the door
I don't wanna hear it
I know what the truth is
I ain't tryna do this
Ain't no use in tryna stay
If you gone turn me loose

If you gone turn me loose
Tryna hold on to us
If you gone turn me loose
Say what you gonna do
If you gone turn me loose

When I call you don't answer
Say what you gonna do if you gone turn me loose
You need to let it go

Turn me loose!

Say what you gone do
If you gone

Better than you!
