My heart went leaping
The day you came along
Forgot my weeping
The day you came along
Before I knew it I hummed a little song
The day you came along

I only drifted before you came along
The fog was lifted
Because you came along
I sent the blackbirds right back where they belong
The day you came along

Men have conquered nations
Other men have set them free
Pioneers across the sea
You can turn the pages through the ages but for me
Twas the most eventful day in history

Two souls were mated
The day you came along
A world created
The day you came along
One glance convinced me
I knew I wasn't wrong
The day you came along

Two souls were mated
The day you came along
A world created
The day you came along
One glance convinced me
I knew I wasn't wrong
The day you came along

Love came this day
The day you came along
