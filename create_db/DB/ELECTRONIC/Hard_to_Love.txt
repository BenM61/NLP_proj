Trust is all that I need from you
Enough, to restore my faith in you
Lights, break when you need them to
'Cause your flaws are never your own to use

And you whisper replies that hover so weightless
Drain all their lies between our faces, now
And you make it hard to love
You make it hard to

Tell me, nothing has changed
That words still hold all the same
And you, you make it hard to love
You make it hard to
Believe promises vowed
Are holding on to their value now
'Cause you make it hard to love
You make it hard to love

Speak, only what pleases you
Breathe into me a weak excuse
Clutched to slivers of golden fumes
'Cause your eyes have become nostalgia's muse

And you whisper replies that hover so weightless
Drain all their lies between our faces, now
And you make it hard to love
You make it hard to

Tell me, nothing has changed
That words still hold all the same
'Cause you, you make it hard to love
Yeah, you make it hard to
Believe promises vowed
Are holding on to their value now
'Cause you make it hard to love
You make it hard to love
You make it hard to love

I forgot how your words could make me feel weightless
Now you just pull me down from my graces
'Cause you make it hard to love
You make it hard to love
'Cause you make it hard

Tell me, nothing has changed
That words still hold all the same
And you, you make it hard to love
You make it hard to
'Cause you make it hard to love
Believe promises vowed
Are holding on to their value now
You make it hard to love
You make it hard to love
'Cause you make it hard to love
