And if there's nothing left to say,
I'll string you along until I get my way,
'cause all those sudden
Like I want to know if you weren't to please

And if you want to dance, if she wants to lead, 
I want mind

Let's try this over again, only faster now,
Now go with her and pretend, I'm your master now,

And if you want to dance, and she wants to lead,
I'll go outta my way, I'll do anything,
And one word is all I need.

And if, you know it's all in your mind,
Take your time with this one,
You both deserve a good time,
In every position, that I can think of,

If you want to dance, and she wants to lead, 
I'll go outta my way, I'll do anything,
And one word is all I need

Let's try this over again, only faster now,
Now go with her and pretend, I'm your master now,

And if you want to dance, and she wants to lead,
I'll go outta my way, to make you believe,
That your love is all I need.
