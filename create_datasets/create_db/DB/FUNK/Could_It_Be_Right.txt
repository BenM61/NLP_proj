If I came to you and I
Said you are my desire
Would it last forever

If I tell you endlessly
How much you mean to me
Will you stay forever

You and I together
Love changes lives for better
Dreams are made to let in
Let's take a ride  to heaven

Hold me
Shine your love tonight
Tender in the light
While we're dancing

Hold me
Deep inside your heart
I wonder in the dark
Could it be right
(Could it be right)
Could it be right
(Could it be right)

You can make my life a song
Where nothing can go wrong
As long as we're together

I will take away the pain
Be your shelter from the rain
We can hide together

To the door
You lead me
Somehow I know you need me

Hold me
Shine your love tonight
Tender in the light
While we're dancing

Hold me
Deep inside your heart
I wonder in the dark
Could it be right
(Could it be right)
Could it be right
(Could it be right)

Time will take us away
Give us reason to fight for love today
I'll keep on pushing
To be close to you
I want to hear you say

(Could it be right)
Could it be right
(Could it be right)
Could it be right

Hold me
Shine your love tonight
Tender in the light
While we're dancing

Hold me
Deep inside your heart
I wonder in the dark
Could it be right

Hold me
Shine your love tonight
Tender in the light
While we're dancing

Hold me
Deep inside your heart
I wonder in the dark
Could it be right

Hold me
Deep inside your heart
I wonder in the dark
Could it be right
