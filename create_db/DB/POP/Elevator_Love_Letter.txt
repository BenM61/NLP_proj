I'm so hard for a rich girl
My heels are high, my eyes cast low
Cause I don't know how to love 
I take it out on my good friends
But the worst stays in
Or where would I begin? 

My office glows all night long
It's a nuclear show and the stars are gone
Elevator, elevator, take me home 

I'm so hard for the rich girl
Her heels so high and my hopes so low
Cause I don't know how to love 

I'll take her home after midnight
And if she likes, I'll tell her lies
Of how we'll fall in love by the morning
I don't think she'll know
That I'm saying goodbye.. 

My office glows all night long
It's a nuclear show and the stars are gone
Elevator, elevator, take me home 

My office glows all night long
It's a nuclear show and the stars are gone
Elevator, elevator, take me home 

Don't go!
Say you'll stay!
Spend a lazy Sunday in my arms
I won't take anything away 

Don't go!
Say you'll stay!
Spend a lazy Sunday in my arms
Don't take anything away
