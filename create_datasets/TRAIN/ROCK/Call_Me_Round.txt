Call me round, call me round
Don't be afraid, why don't you call
Call me round, call me round
Don't be afraid just call me round

If any time you feel alone
Don't you be sad, you can pick up the phone
And I'll be home

I could make you mine tomorrow
Let me know you care
Tell me what I want to hear
And I'll be there, yes I'll be there

Call me round, call me round
Don't be afraid just call me round

I know that you're the only one
I know you should be here to carry on
Carry on

And I'll be there so call me round
And I'll be there so call me round
