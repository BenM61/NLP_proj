You lit a cigarette
As I watched you walk away
Turned to a silhouette
But your words will never fade
I know I'm hanging on
And you still numb the pain
I gave it everything, everything
But we still lost the way

You tell me that it's over
When it's only just begun
You tell me that you're sober
When you've had another

One for the memories
The silence is deafening
I can't keep living on repeat
I'm a broken record

Some things are permanent
Like the ink that's on my skin
How could I forget?
The places that we've been?
I know I'm hanging on
To a bullet in the wind
I gave it everything, everything
Now there's nothing left to give

Ooh, you tell me that it's over
When it's only just begun
You tell me that you're sober
When you've had another

One for the memories
The silence is deafening
I can't keep living on repeat
I'm a broken record
I'm a broken record

You're a lonely song
That I'll play forever
I just can't move on
Where did we go wrong?
Tell me do you remember?
I just can't move on

Give me one for the memories
The silence is deafening
I can't keep living on repeat
I'm a broken record

I can't keep living on repeat
I'm a broken record
I'm a broken record
I'm a broken record
