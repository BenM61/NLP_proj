I need your love
I need it in away it hurts me
I won't give up
I won't give up so come and get me

Boy you really messed around
Put me six feet under ground
Always kick me when I am down
But I am still driving through your town

Tried to fake it I can't take it
Why you trap my heart
I can't shake it 'bout to break in
To a hundred million bits

I need your love
I need it in away it hurts me
I won't give up
I won't give up so come and get me

I need your love
I need it in away it hurts me
I won't give up
I won't give up so come and get me

Wish that you could wear my crown
And feel the way I am feeling now
But I can't help but say your name
It's lighting when your in my veins

Tried to fake it I can't take it
Why you trap my heart
I can't shake it 'bout to break in
To a hundred million bits

I need your love
I need it in away it hurts me
I won't give up
I won't give up so come and get me

Boy you really broke my heart
Took my love and tore it up
But I am coming back for you
Come and claim our love after blue
All the things you did to me
I forgive them quietly
But I will never forget
Still I am in your bed

I need your love (I don't want it)
I need it in away it hurts me (you really hurt me baby)
I won't give up (now I'm giving up)
I won't give up so come and get me (won't you come and get me)

I need your love (I don't want it)
I need it in away it hurts me (you really hurt me baby)
I won't give up (now I'm giving up)
I won't give up so come and get me (won't you, won't you, won't you come and get me baby)
