Her glance hits me like lightning
I heard that girl is fast and frightening
Dirty hair and a laugh that's mean
Her neighbors call her an evil machine

She's fast, she's lean
She's frightening
She's fast, she's lean
She's frightening

Popping wheelies on her motorbike
Straight girls wish they were dykes
She'll do anything on a dare
Mom and Daddy's worst nightmare

Down at the creek smoking pot
She eats the roach so she don't get caught
Throws her mini off in the halls
Got so much clit she don't need no balls
