So much pain, we
Don't know how to be but angry
Feel infected like we've got gangrene
Please don't let anybody try to change me

Me
Just me
In the middle of a sea full of faces
Full of faces
Some laugh some salivate
Whats in your alleyway
Recycling bins or bullet cases

Its not equal
Its not fair
Were different people
But were not scared
We ain't never scared
To pave a new path
Make a new street
Build a new bridge

Say can you see by the dawns early light
Free slaves running
Songs words weren't right
Now a new days coming
The few stay stunning while the many are handsome
Your soul is alive but they want it for ransom
The base drumming is the anthem
We step to the heartbeats of our granddaughters and grandsons
And

Rise together
We rise together

Lost hope and found need
Grounded by our surroundings
Did the walls scream universities
Or you and I verse the tees
React automatic and we burst when squeezed
And make 9-11 each emergency
Urgency amber to red like the turning leaves
Oh please let the hurting cease
Don't let apathy police the populace
We will march across
Those stereotypes that were marked for us
The answers obvious
We switch the consonants
Change the sword to words and lift continents

Rise together
We rise together

If you believe in redemption
I'm calling to you from another dimension
I'm calling to you from another dimension
