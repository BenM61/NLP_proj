Sending out a signal from the city, we went
Towards a future that is greener than the money we spent
Discover beaches buried deeper underneath the cement
Look down through the cracks for the gold that they're hiding

Gliding through the wind that blew through clothes that we wore
But we cling tighter through the hailstone 'til we reach a new shore
Want to be nourished by the heat that radiates and restores
Lie down in the sun and get something for nothing

First light
The fields are ablaze
Cuts through the haze
Light it up quicker
Each day
Never the same
Never again
Get in the picture

Water falls around us and it flows where it likes
We like the current going forward and give into the fight
We cast our net and come to settle, now the ocean's in sight
Sit back and float down through this air that we're breathing

While they grew our daydreams in the heat of the sun
We're reaching taller by the hillside where the water is sprung
We'll take the path of least resistance on the life we begun
Lie down in the sun and get something for nothing

The fields are ablaze
Cuts through the haze
Light it up quicker
Each day
Never the same

Complacencies know our name forever
But we never knew its game 'til later
The higher we are, the further we will fall
