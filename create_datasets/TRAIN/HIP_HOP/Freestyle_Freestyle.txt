Redman in the house, ya don't stop
Gilla House in the house, ya don't stop
Def Squad in the house, ya don't stop
Wu Tang in the house, ya don't stop
Hip hop in the house, ya don't stop

Yeah, Redman gotta light that green
People always say, "What the hell does that mean?"

Wussup, homeboy, I'm a muh****ker rider
Custom made Airs and my shoes never tied up
Hardcore sh****, do it eazier than wider
While you sittin', home gettin' baby mama drama

Jersey, Uptown, go, pick my weed up
Broke? I ain't turning your see to a D cup
**** I'm a G, I never give my keys up
Not even half if you didn't sign a pre-nupt

Watch how we thump, I'm 'bout my bid-ness
You about to go downtown like the shiznit
Witness, yeah, boy
I get ya dumb like white people lookin' for weird noise

Hood down, got B. Smalls on my white tee
And my chain look like an Italian icee
Redman **** grind like brakes
'Cause I'm after that cake like Steadman ****

Freestyle, freestyle, freestyle
Freestyle, freestyle, freestyle
And everywhere I go I kick a freestyle
And every time I move these women freestyle

Freestyle, freestyle, freestyle
Freestyle, freestyle, freestyle
Redman gotta light that green
People always say, "What the hell does that mean?"

Okay yo, I got Bricks in the building
Young kids out here, flip ya like Wilson
Pilgrim, there it is
The block is Tina Marie, I'm on my square biz

Turn up the kid like volume ten
And you can brown-nose me 'til the album in
You was hot when your style was in
Now ya lookin' at Gilla, I wish I was down with them

No time to turn back, I keep my eyes focused
Slow like I'm on the I-95 smoking
Like 'Ocean's Twelve' when I'm postin' smell
My zip lock when the red line open

Fat girls like, "Yo that's my hero"
Enough of them to pull a Five-Five-Zero
Incog-negro, after the cream
I'm in your hood like WatchTime magazine

I mean, for bulls**** my nose keen
It only takes one hit to get in those jeans
It's not your ****, girl, it's your brain
Now when I hit it I keep the chicken lo mein

Back on the train like, "Who the hell are you?"
I'm Doc, I bring heat like number 32
Brick city ****, yeah, yeah, a rider
La-La-La, don't steal my damn lighter

See, I'm on point, never catch me slippin'
Storch on the track, watch how Reggie rip it
Sniff it, you'll know it's on again
Walked in this muhfu**** like I own da ****

I'm not in Cancun, I'm out in Grant tomb
On one wheel throwing it up like, "Man move"
Back on my grizzly, yeah, take that
You want the crack I prepared it ASAP, yeah

Freestyle, freestyle, freestyle
Freestyle, freestyle, freestyle
And everywhere I go I kick a freestyle
And every time I move these women freestyle

Freestyle, freestyle, freestyle
Freestyle, freestyle, freestyle
Redman gotta light that green
People always say, "What the hell does that mean?"

Wussup, homegirl, we a muh****ker riders
Met her outside of the Copacabana
Far from a sucka, pull out the 'lama
And tell on myself like, "Yo, well your honor"

See, I blast on sight when I move
That battery pack on my back stay full
I ain't no joke, I keep y'all steppin'
Doc got next ****, drop y'all weapon

Screen on my mic got hash tar resins
Engineer **** up, laughing all reckless
I'm like, "Shutup, Gilla house got this"
Arms grew longer for my short pockets

Stop it? I wish, I can
I'm trying to be building green like MGM Grand
Get it? Redman, who the **** are you?
Got weed? Let me bust a you ****

Freestyle, freestyle, freestyle
Freestyle, freestyle, freestyle
And everywhere I go I kick a freestyle
And every time I move these women freestyle

Freestyle, freestyle, freestyle
Freestyle, freestyle, freestyle
Redman gotta light that green
People always say, "What the hell does that mean?"

Gilla, Gilla, Gilla, Gilla
