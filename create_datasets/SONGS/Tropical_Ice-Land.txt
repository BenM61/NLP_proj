Goat's head in the deli case 
Oh sweet angel-angel-bearded face 
Paper mache parade on at night 
That's what you do with no sunlight 

In the tropical tropical 
Tropical ice-land 

Bleak church on a cold tundra 
Mountain-glacier-glacier-glacier-stream 
Black stone beach and a black death bottle 
Is all me and my baby'll need 

In the tropical, tropical 
Tropical ice-land 

Take intermission at the movies 
Freeze outside for one quick smoke 
Take a klondike bar from the pop machine 
Hey it's ice cream, no not coke 

In the tropical tropical 
Tropical ice-land 

Let's meet in Kristiana next summer 
Let's get out before we melt away 
I've seen enough stray ponies and puffins 
To get me through till the end of May 

In the tropical tropical 
Tropical ice-land
