Still taking pictures of people at rest
Smiling at men who are never impressed
Always working hard down on bended knee
Who else but me can see the change in Louise

Ride Louise, ride (yeah) let me be your guide
I'll take you any place you want to go, (yes I will)
Ride Louise, ride (yeah) let me be your guide
And I'll show you all the things you want to know (if I can)

Living her life at a speed all her own
Talking to people where ever she goes
Always working hard she won't disagree
Who else but me can see the change in Louise

Ride Louise, ride (yeah) let me be your guide
I'll take you any place you want to go, (yes I will)
Ride Louise, ride (yeah) let me be your guide
And I'll show you all the things you want to know (if I can)
