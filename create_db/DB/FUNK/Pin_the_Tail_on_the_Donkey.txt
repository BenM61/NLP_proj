You're nearer than my head is to my pillow
Nearer than the wind is to the willow
Dearer than the rain is to the earth below
Precious as the sun to the things that grow

You're nearer than the Ivy to the the wall is
Nearer than the winter to the fall is
Leave me but when you're away
You'll know you're nearer for I love you so

You're nearer for I love you so
