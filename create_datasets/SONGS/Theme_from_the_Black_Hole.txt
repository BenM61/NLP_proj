A toast to the booty
Feel that, do that
For how else can you capture a boogie
If you don't attack from the back
To the rear, march

My name is the one
Some people call me the funk
Here's a toast to the boogie!
Said my name is the one
Some people call me the funk, oh
I'll toast to that

And when I find a vacant booty
I move right in on the rump, ooh
I'm like a camel
Humpin' to please
I'm up to my hump in funk, yeah
Here's a toast to the boogie

I've got jam in my legs
And I'm ready to spread
All around the world for the funk
I'll toast to that
We don't cut in
We just butt in
So baby, may I have this dance?

Here's a toast to the boogie
We'll funk to that
Bottoms up

I'll toast to that
I'll toast to that
Bottoms up!

Here's a toast to the boogie
We'll funk to that, bottoms up
Here's a toast to the boogie
We'll funk to that, bottoms up

Oww, my name is the one
Some people call me the funk
Here's a toast to the boogie
Said my name is the one
Some people call me the funk
I'll toast to that

And when I find a vacant booty
I move right in on the rump
(Move in on the rump)
I'm like a camel
Double-humpin' to please
I am up to my hump in my funk
Here's a toast to the boogie

I've got jam in my legs
And I'm ready to spread
All around the world for the funk

I am Sir Nose
D'Voidoffunk
(Double-humpin' to please)
And I will never dance
Prepare to meet your end, Starchild
For a tail is nothing but a long booty

And this is a tale that I win in the end
And I have pinned the tail on the funky
And you shall dwell in the face of the mule forever, Starchild
Oh, mule-mug, oh donkey-puss, Starchild

Ahahahaha
Humdrum, tweedle-dee dum, Starchild
And I have made a jackass out of the funk
Oh, mule-mug, oh donkey-puss
I, Sir Nose D'Voidoffunk
Shall never dance!

Yo ho, yourself, Starchild
Where's your flash light?
Where's your bop gun?
Where's the Doctor, Starchild?
Better tell the Doctor you need a house call, Starchild
Oh, mule-mug, oh donkey-puss
