I dreamed of a place
That is always on my mind
(On my mind)

It's where the blue waters run
Down the mountain-side to the sea
(Hey)

In Mazatlan
In Mazatlan
In Mazatlan
In Mazatlan

You've never seen such a sight
Who makes the day of the night
The wonders your eyes behold
In little Mexico so

Your joy you cannot control
(Arriba)
