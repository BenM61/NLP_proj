(M. Riperton R. Rudolph M. Henderson)

I'm young willing and able ... to make you come apart at the seams
I'm young willing and able ... think of me as peaches and cream
Just step up to my table ... I'm servin' up a hunk-a-your dreams
'Cause I'm young willing and able ... baby you know what I mean

Just say you want me to, and I'll supply for you
'Bout all the love your little heart desires
And if you need a friend, well you can count me in
What's more I'm able to light your fire

I'm young willing and able ... too hot to trot
I'm young willing and able ... What you want is what I got
Just hook up to my cable ... if what it is, is what you thought
'Cause I'm young willing and able ... and baby I'm gettin' hot
