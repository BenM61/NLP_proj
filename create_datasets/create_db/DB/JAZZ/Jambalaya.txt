Jambalay-a
Jambalay-a
Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and film gumbo
'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-o
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou
Goodbye, Joe, me gotta go, me-o, my-o
Me gotta go, pole the pirogue down the bayou
Oh my John, the sweetest one, me-o, my-o
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou
Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and film gumbo
'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-o
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou
Thibodaux, Fontaineaux, the place is buzzin'
Kinfolk come to see my John by the dozen
Dressed in style and go hog wild, me-o, my-o
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou
Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and film gumbo
'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-o
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou
Settle down far from town, get me a pirogue
Oh, I'll catch all the fish in the bayou
Swap my mon to buy my John what he need-o
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou
Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and film gumbo
'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-o
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou
Jambalay-a, hey John
Jambalay-a, hey John
