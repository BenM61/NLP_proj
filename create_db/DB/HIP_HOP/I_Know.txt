She wants that old thing back
She want those heroin tracks, she likes me
She fiends for me nightly, she leans for me
Morning she rush for my touch, this is about lust
Cold sweats occur when I'm not with her
My presence is a must, must, must,
Bonita apple bum, I gotta put you on
If I didn't when we cuttin' the feeling would be too strong
In any form, I'm giving you sweet dreams
That sugar hill, she call me her sweet thing
That black rain that take away your pain
Just for one night, baby, take me in vein
Now that feelin' got you trippin'
You no wanna feel no differently
Said lust has got you itchin'
All wide open and its' drippin'
I know what you like, I am your prescription
I'm your physician, I'm your addiction

And I know and I know
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
I know what you like
Everything you love
I know what you like
Everything you love
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
I know what you like, hov
Baby you love, hov
Baby you love, hov
Baby you love, hov

I am so dope
Like Louboutins with the red bottoms
You gotta have 'em, you glad you got 'em
Like every color Giuseppe's, your guilty pleasure is me
Its so much fun, you shun therapy
Although it never be, the feeling is fleeting
Shopping's like coppin', you constantly need it
I'm never around, you constantly seek it
You'll never be down, I know where your peak is
Nine and a half weeks is better than twelve steps
I keep tryin' to remind you to keep tellin' yourself
Now your conscience is interfering, like "better yourself!"
Like you better get help
But when that medicine's felt?
We're back together
Don't ever leave me
Don't ever let 'em tell you that you'll never need me
My china white, 'til we d.o.a.
Its Montego forever, baby, lets get away

And I know and I know
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
I know what you like
Everything you love
I know what you like
Everything you love
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
I know what you like, hov
Baby you love, hov
Baby you love, hov
Baby you love, hov

How could you leave me?
I thought that you needed me!
When the world got too much and you pleaded with me,
Who helped you immediately?
How speedy of me!
How could you deny me so vehemently?
Now your body is shakin' trying to free it of me
And your soul is in control, trying to lead it from me
And your heart no longer pledge allegiance to me
Damn, I'm missing the days when you needed the d

And I know and I know
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
I know what you like
Everything you love
I know what you like
Everything you love
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
I know what you like, hov
Baby you love, hov
Baby you love, hov
Baby you love, hov
