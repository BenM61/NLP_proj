Driving in my car
We stop for a while
It's getting so late
And you're sendin' me wild.	
I know that it's madness
But oh
Oh
Oh
I'm scared
Oh
So scared.
Taking my hand
Try to settle down
We won't say a word
'til it's over.
And your eyes are so inviting
I know that if we stay	
I'll never take you home.
You said you were seventeen	
But you are somewhere in-between
That leads me on
How old are you?
Runaway to open arms
You're just a girl with woman's charms
That turns me on
How old are you?
You've been busy lying
You've made it up to now
I'm caught up in the heat of the moment.
If you love me and then leave me it's the story of my life
And I wonY be in the morning
The man I am tonight.
So
Little girl
Please try to understand
You mean more to me than a one night stand.
I'm losing all resistance
My head has lost control
It's strong
Oh
So strong.
Deep in the night
Shadows all around
Lost in the magic forever
And I know that when you touch me
My heart won't let me down.
I'm scared
Oh
So scared.
You said you were seventeen but you are somewhere in-between
. . .
Fighting all temptation
I've made it up to now.
I'm caught up in the heat of the moment.
If you love me and then leave me
It's the story of my life
And I won't be in the morning the man I am tonight.
You said you were seventeen but you are somewhere in-between
. . .
You said you were seventeen but you are somewhere in-between
