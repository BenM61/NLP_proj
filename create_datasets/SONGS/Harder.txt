Oh oh my my my
My man's up all night
Works me till I moan
Drives me out of my mind

Why it so hard
Must be made out of cold steel
Why it so hard
He's a man running my wheel

Just keep me burning
Just keeps me yearning
Put my whole body on fire
Burning whole body desire

Why it so hard
Yeah taking me over
Why it so hard
My cold steel soldier

Harder
Harder
Harder

Oh oh make me beg
Eats meat in my bed
Works me till I'm done
Mad dog can sure hunt

Why it so hard
Must be made out of cold steel
Why it so hard
C'mon Daddy drive my wheel

Harder
Harder
Harder

Why it so hard
Money made out of cold steel
Why it so hard
He's a turning my wheel

Harder
Harder
Harder
Yeah
