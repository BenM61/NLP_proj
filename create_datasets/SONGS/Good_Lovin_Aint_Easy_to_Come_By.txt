Good lovin' ain't easy
Good lovin' ain't easy
Good lovin' ain't easy to come by
Oh, darlin', that's the kind you offer me
It's just the love to be found
'Cause we're workin' on a buildin' nobody can tear down
Look what we've got, ho-ho-ho-honey

Good lovin' ain't easy
Good lovin' ain't easy, darlin'
Good lovin' ain't easy to come by, oh no no
I've tried the good life and I know
It's a playground where no one cares
But at last you'll find out that don't compare
To what we've got, ho-ho-ho-honey

It takes more than just a song and dance
You've got to work and fight to give it a chance
If the rain comes down on us
And there ain't no place to run
We'll just cover ourselves with a blanket of love
And wait till the mornin' comes
Oh baby, let's do it today
Inflection
Give us protection

Good lovin' ain't easy to come by
Some think it's a plaything
You can toss away when it's old
But when love's valued in pieces
It's worth more than gold
That's what we've got

Good lovin' ain't easy to come by
Oh, oh, it ain't easy
