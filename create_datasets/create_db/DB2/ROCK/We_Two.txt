All alone, on my own,
Since I walked out on you I walked out on me, now
It's gone,
And you, what to do,

There's so much time and so many nights to get through,
Oh why do we play, and why do we lose,
It's a dangerous life we live, we two. 
We are fools, we make all these rules,

We make it so hard to find love, to feel free, to
Be fresh outta school,
And now, what of romance,
Do we know that life is sweeter when we're taking a chance,

So why do we run, and why do we cry,
It's crazy life we live, you and I. 
Carousels and wishing wells were the things we loved,
To fly away in a big balloon was what she talked of, oh ... 

Alone, out on my own,
I just wander the streets and stare at the places
We've known,
And now, what of myself,

Can I go on pretending a love for somebody else,
Oh why do we play, and why do we lose,
It's a dangerous life we live, we two. 
Carousels and wishing wells were the things we loved,

Why did we play, why did we stay alone, we two,
To fly away in a big balloon was what she talked of,
Why did we love and leave the memory of we two,
Now she is gone, I'm left to carry on.
