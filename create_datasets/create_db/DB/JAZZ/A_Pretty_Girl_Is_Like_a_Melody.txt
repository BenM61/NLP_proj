I have an ear for music, and I have an eye for a maid. 
I like a pretty girl-ie, with each pretty tune that's played. 
They go together, like sunny weather goes with the month of May. 
I've studied girls and music, so I'm qualified to say 

[Chorus]
A pretty girl is like a melody that haunts you night and day, 
Just like the strain of a haunting refrain, 
She'll start up on a marathon and run a-round your brain. 
You can't escape she's in your memory. by morning night and noon. 
She will leave you and then come back a-gain, 
A pretty girl is just like a pretty tune.

I have an ear for music, and I have an eye for a maid. 
I like a pretty girl-ie, with each pretty tune that's played. 
They go together, like sunny weather goes with the month of May. 
I've studied girls and music, so I'm qualified to say 

[Chorus]
