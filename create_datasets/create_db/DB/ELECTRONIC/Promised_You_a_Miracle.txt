Promised you a miracle
Belief is a beauty thing
Promises promises
As golden days break wondering
Chance as love takes a train
Summer breeze and brilliant light
Only love she sees
He controls on love
Love sails to a new life

Promised you a miracle
Belief is a beauty thing
Promises promises
As golden days break wondering
Only love she sees
He controls on love
Life mirrors a cure
Everything is possible
With promises
Everything is possible
Oh no

I promised you a miracle
Belief is a beauty thing
Promises promises
As golden days break wondering
Chance reflects on them a while
Love screams so quietly
Slipping back on golden times
Breathing with sweet memories

Promised you a miracle
Belief is a beauty thing
Promises promises
As golden days break wondering

Only love she sees
He controls on love
Life mirrors a cure
Everything is possible in the game of life
Everything is possible
Oh no

Chance lost pearls of great price
Take care of family
Only aches for love
Love waits for fame
In chance in chance they'll see

I promised you a miracle
Belief is a beauty thing
Promises promises
As golden days break wondering

Only love she sees
He controls on love
Life throws a cure
Everything is possible in the game of life
A burning dream
You can be Queen
Everything is possible
