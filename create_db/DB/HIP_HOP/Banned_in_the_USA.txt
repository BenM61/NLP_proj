Earlier today a Broward County appellate court judge has
Upheld the previous ruling to ban the sale of Miami rap group 
The 2 Live Crew's double-platinum album, "Nasty As They Wanna Be," in Broward County

We think it's the banning of free speech
First Amendment protects material, presumptively

We don't talk about, uh, harassing and sexually brutalizing women in my music, man!
We don't do that in my music, man, I'm tired of you saying that!

We've got white-collar people trying to grab our style
Saying we're too nasty and we're 2 Live
Corrupted politicians playing games
Bringing us down to boost their fame
They must be joking, thinking we will fall
But they're like flies movin' the wall
We stand tall from beginning to end
With the help from fans and all our friends
Freedom of speech will never die
For us to have, our ancestors died
Don't keep thinking that we will quit
We'll always stand and never sit
We're 2 Live, too black, too strong
Doing the right thing, and not the wrong
So listen up, y'all, to what we say
We won't be banned in the U-S-A!

Our record is a year old, but with all the publicity
There's a lot of people, curiosity is aroused
We're selling records to a totally different audience
I take a precaution that nobody else has
I stickered my album
I made two versions, two versions, two versions

The First Amendment gave us freedom of speech
So what you sayin', it didn't include me?
I like to party and have a good time
There's nothin' but pleasure written in our rhymes
I know you don't think we'll ever quit
We've got some people on our side who won't take your lip
We're gonna do all the things we wanna do
You can't stand to see a brother get as rich as you
This is the 90's and we're comin' on strong
Sayin' things and doin' things that you're sayin's wrong
Wisen up, cause on Election Day
We'll see who's banned in the U-S-A!

The show in Hollywood, those were 21-and-older people
They had police out there
Cardin' the people coming in the club
And they still arrested us for performing in front of adults!

What is this? Is this not America?
This is not China, this is not Russia!
This is not the place where they brought down the wall
This is America!
We have the right to say what we want to say
We have the right to do what we want to do
And what I do in my house, you might not do in your house
So what I do in my house is my business
And the simple fact of it all is that we are bonded by the First Amendment!
We have the freedom of expression!
We have the freedom of choice!
And you, Chinese, black, green, purple, Jew
You have the right to listen to whoever you want to
And even the 2 Live Crew! (2 Live Crew, 2 Live Crew)
So all you right-wingers, left-wingers
Bigots, Communists, there is a place for you in this world!
Because this is the land of the free, the home of the brave
And 2 Live is what we are!
