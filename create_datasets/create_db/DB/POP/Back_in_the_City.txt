Warm nights in the city, someone's playing Latin in the park
Street lights shining pretty, shadows on the lovers in the dark
It's the reason for the getaway
Lay upon the roof and just forget about the day
 Chorus:
Back in the city, everybody moves to a different beat in the city
See the motion, feel the heat of the city
Something's happening in the streets of the city
Cool breeze on the river, making you aware that you're alive
Bodies start to shiver, passions start to shift to overdrive
Picture feelings that you can't control
Elementary voices calling deep inside your soul
chorus
(Instrumental break)
chorus repeats out
