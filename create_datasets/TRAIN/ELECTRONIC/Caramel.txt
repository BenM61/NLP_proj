You fell down the stairs
Been done before
Stuck to the seats
Like caramel, caramel

No word is spoken
Try act serene
Stuck on each other
Like caramel, caramel

Red splendour above my head
The ugly, the bad and the good
I saw you projected there
On canvas oil of blood

World, where have you gone
Watch them leving
Stuck on somebody else
Like caramel, caramel

Red splendour above my head
The ugly, the bad and the good
I saw you projected there
On canvas oil of blood

Strung out on each others lines
Heroes with an edge
I saw you projected there
But it didn't make any sense
