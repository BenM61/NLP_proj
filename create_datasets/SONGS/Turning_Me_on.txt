I can't keep my eyes off you
 Face to face, you're a dream come true
 Make me shake, the way you do
 Sexually, I'm attracted to you

 You're really, really turning me on
 The more and more I stare at you
 The closer I'm drawn
 'Cause you're really, really turning me
 Really, really turning me
 Really, really turning me on

 You've got me so mesmerized
 Tantalized, you've got me hypnotized
 Gazing deep into your soul
 I can't help this I'm losing control

 You're really, really turning me on
 The more and more I stare at you
 The closer I'm drawn
 'Cause you're really, really turning me
 Really, really turning me
 Really, really turning me on

 I never wanted to touch somebody
 The way that I want to touch you
 And I know that you feel the same way
 So let's go

 I can't help myself when I'm next to you
 I'm holding back from doing things I want to do
 You better watch yourself 'cause I'm not that strong
 And you're really, really turning me on
