Try a run, try a hide,
Escape your only truth, for a while
Live the past, create a picture, it won't last
A million colors to a lie, it won't last

When the sun is cold and black
When you wanna scream and shout
And the record plays the dark side of the moon
When the sun is cold and black
When you wanna scream and shout
And the record plays the dark side of the moon

Brighter days, on a distant shore
You realized it's steep, to the top
Never fight, a never win reality
A million colors to a lie, that will fade

When the sun is cold and black
When you wanna scream and shout
And the record plays the dark side of the moon
When the sun is cold and black
When you wanna scream and shout
And the record plays the dark side of the moon

So good... let me lose myself...
So good... let me lose myself...
So good... let me lose myself...
So good... let me lose myself...

When the sun is cold and black
When you wanna scream and shout
And the record plays the darkside of the moon
When the sun is cold and black
When you wanna scream and shout
And the record plays the darkside of the moon
When the sun is cold and black
When you wanna scream and shout
And the record plays the darkside of the moon
