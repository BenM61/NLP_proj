Now on the night I arrived
My daddy said "Sake's Alive!"
It's the meanest one that we've had yet
Teethed on tin and weaned on gin
I was nobody's teacher's pet

I grew up rough and mean
In my early teens
And I didn't want to go to school
I called no man "Sir"
Work was a dirty word
My biggest kick was breakin' the rules

So when you see me comin' get away
The ones that didn't ain't around today
The sweetest piece of lovin' any girl ever had
I'm here to tell you boys I was born to be bad

Born, born to be bad
I was born
Born to be bad

Now when I reached twenty one I knew the time had come
I had that old ramblin' itch
Breaking little girls hearts I tore the world apart
A guitar playin' son of a (guitar)

Born to be bad 
That is the story of my life
Doin' things wrong was my way of doin' things right 

Now when I'm gray and old
And my story is told
I know what the people will say
They'll be glad to see me go
But the little girls'll know
I was bad till my dyin' day

So when you see me comin' get away
The ones that didn't ain't around today
The sweetest piece of loving any girl ever had
I'm here to tell you boys I was born to be bad

Born, born to be bad
I was born
Born to be bad

Born to be bad 
That is the story of my life
Doin' things wrong was my way of doin' things right 

Now when I'm old and gray
And I've had my day
I know what the people will do
They'll be glad to see me go
But the little girls'll know
I was bad till the day I was Through

So when you see me comin' get away
The ones that didn't ain't around today
The sweetest piece of loving any girl ever had
I'm here to tell you boys I was born to be bad

Born, born to be bad
I was born
Born to be bad
I was born
Born to be bad, yeah

Bad!
