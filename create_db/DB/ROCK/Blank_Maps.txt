Don't you wait on me, I'll shoo you down 
Keep your eyes closed, your ear to the ground
Pick up in the middle of the night
Kill the silence, I can't bear to speak
Head for the heart, does it break
Words may fall, the body remains
And every map is blank

When my words head for the cracks 
Will you have my back
We were good children
Darling, let it out 

I hold my breath, don't like to move
When the night comes, who will you be
Even the dead cannot be astoundingly alive
I am I am, I am I am a goddamn believer 

When my words head for the clouds
Will you have my back
We were good children
Darling, let it out

Well, I am I am, I am I am a goddamn believer
