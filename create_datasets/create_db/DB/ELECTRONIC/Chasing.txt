Keep on staring from the corner
You don't even know I'm here
Heart is beating like a drummer
Caught up in your fever, caught up in your fever

I'll keep dancing over here
Stealing glimpses in the mirror
Lose myself under the glitter
We could be together, dreaming of forever

I'll keep chasing
I'll keep chasing
I'll keep chasing you

In the darkness under cover
Watch you movin' every color
You're so close you smell like summer
You could pull me under, let you pull me under

We start moving once together
It's electric under pressure
Want so much you can't surrender
I could run forever, I could run forever

I'll keep chasing
I'll keep chasing
I'll keep chasing you
