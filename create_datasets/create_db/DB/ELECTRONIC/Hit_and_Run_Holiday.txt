I'm tired of just driving around.
Let's go some place.
Alright, like where we going?
Anywhere, just as long as we stay out good and late!

Let Go!  And swing it to the street beat.
Put the road under your wheels and burn, Baby.
Tune into the high life.
Take it on a wild, wild ride.

Let Go! And take it to the speedway.  
Get into the action and kiss it all goodbye, Bye Baby.
Upll it into outer-space living in a wild wild race.
Move into your mind's eye, 
running with the wind.
Super-sonic cool drag, 
little hit & run heroine. 
Let Go!  Bye Baby.  
Let Go!  Bye Baby.
