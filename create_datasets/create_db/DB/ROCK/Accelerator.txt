I walk sick streets full of dead meat 
See empty heads and cancelled eyes 
I got a pain, I got a hunger 
Lord my soul ain't satisfied 

Come on, come on 
Hit the accelerator, the accelerator
Come on, come on 
Hit the accelerator, the accelerator 

Ain't hard to be a sinner 
Lord it's hard to be a saint 
Had a taste, you've had a glimmer 
Start to shiver can't be what you ain't
Come on, come on 
Hit the accelerator, the accelerator 
Come on, come on 
Hit the accelerator, the accelerator
Come on! 

Here we come, we're coming fast
All the others are in the past 
Voices screaming in my head, 
Into the future, into the future 

Come on, come on 
Hit the accelerator the accelerator
Come on, come on 
Hit the accelerator the accelerator
Come on, come on 
Hit the accelerator the accelerator
Come on, come on 
Hit the accelerator the accelerator

Come on!
