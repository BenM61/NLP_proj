So many ladies love you with the innocence of a child
A child who believes in God
You keep 'em in luxury
But it's a luxury in the dark

You walk around with a smile upon your face
But there's something that you don't know
You're luck's run out
And it's a time for you to know

Everybody told me I was crazy
To try to tame such a wild one
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

I got myself into this thing
Like I never knew I could an' now
I gotta get away just as fast as I can
I got myself into this thing an' I'll find a way out

You gave me babies, to you that proves your love
Tie my hands with jewels
Barefoot an' pregnant you kept me
You sought to hide me from the truth

But your lady's done bought some shoes
And she's steppin' out on the town
Your lady took herself in hand
And she's spreadin' herself around, alright

I wanted your love but not at any price
You're just the hurtin' kind
Say you want me for yourself
But your deeds deny it

Everybody told me I was crazy
To try to tame such a wild one
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

I got myself into this thing
Like I never knew I could an' now
I gotta get away just as fast as I can
I got myself into this thing an' I'll find a way out
