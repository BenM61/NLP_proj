[Chorus]
Bottom line we gonna work it out
We gonna handle it
We gonna work it out
I can't give up on you baby
don't you give me up on me sugar

[Verse I]
Why I be acting like I don't need you
How many times you gonna say we are though
Are we crazy?
Because lately
We continue to cross that line (yeah)
I'm sick and tired of who's right or wrong
I just need to know our love is strong
Cause in the long run
You are the right one
This is all I have to say

[Chorus (repeat 2X)]
[Bridge]
Baby we can work it out
I know we can work it out
Never ever giving up
Baby that's what loves about
