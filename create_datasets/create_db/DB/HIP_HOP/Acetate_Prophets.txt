Yo, this is a lesson in friendship
The depths of a kinship
Where women and men begin with, and then slip
My pen drips as I scribble my thoughts
On thin strips of emotion
A fraction, seduction, attraction,
Eruption of passion corrupts it
Life lasting friendships involved
Would love to cross the line
But that's why we built these walls

[Chorus]
We've been friends for a long time
A very close friend of mine
Love you like you was mine
But respect the thin line
Love you like you was mine
Think about you all the time
Very close friend of mine
But respect the thin line

Opposites attract
When the female and male come in contact
Sticky situation in fact
Trying not to let the feelings catch
But there's a thin line between both of ya'll
So you respect that
And entertain an idea but get brought
Back to reality
And could you really live with that
Decision, based on intuition
You love and keep it distant
Hug and kiss the friendship

An ongoing friendship
We was people to begin with
Disrespect was not intended
But your feelings sparked a sentence
Sometimes you're too intense
In your quest to invent
The perfect man
Please understand my rhyme is your repent

[Chorus: x2]

Too bad that we became friends first
And I'm not an expert on how relationships work
But, from the minute it was known
It changed the whole tone
The way we spoke on the phone
Yo, it was cool but I felt it wasn't enough
And I was stuck when your moms would pick it up
Over you all my buddies would swoon
But I felt we were in tune
You let me up in your room (damn)
But to me girl you're still off limits
No matter all the times that I hinted
Infatuation was authentic
But yo I just pretended
So I wouldn't lose the friendship
Maybe I should spill all my guts
Or write a letter, then tear it up
Or do a song just to say what's up
I want just a touch

[Chorus]

I can't do this anymore
See my heart just falls out when you walk in the door
Friendship turned into love
On some weak tip
See I can't comprehend even if I knew it
Can't do justice with these things that I'm feeling
You've got someone else don't want to be caught stealing
Hell, if she knew she would never leave us alone in the room

Yo, this was a lesson in friendship
I stress in this sentence
Should women and men be friends first
And then slip
My pen drips as I scribble my thoughts on thin strips of emotion

Opposites attract
And best friends make a perfect match
If you only knew that
Once you cross ain't no turning back
The minute you let him in it and he hit that
That's that

We was people to begin with
But you was too relentless
Jeopardizing kinship
Respect is intended
Resolve is my intent
While we've got an in
I'm trying to salvage a friendship

[Chorus]
