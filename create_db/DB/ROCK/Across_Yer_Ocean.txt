And where we go from here is anybody's guess
These thoughts I've got inside, ain't easy to confess
My hand upon my heart, I draw a little breath
'cause I've fallen down (down, down, down)

And I bleed and I feel that it's all too real
On a wave of emotion sending ships across yer ocean
And I've lost all my reasons but it's you I can believe in

And looking in your eyes, the eyes they fall away
And holding to your hand, I waste away the day
I've got to make it known, I've got to let you see
But I'm not so strong

And I bleed and I feel that it's all too real
On a wave of emotion sending ships across yer ocean
And I've lost all my reasons but it's you I can believe in

Believe in, Believe in oh
Believe in, Believe in oh

No, I'm not that strong

And I bleed and I feel that it's all too real
On a wave of emotion sending ships across yer ocean
And a way of feeling that inside I know I'm healing
All these waves of emotion sending ships across yer ocean
And I've lost all my reasons but it's you I can Believe in
