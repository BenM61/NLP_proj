You keep saying 
You've got something for me
Something you call love
But confess
You've messing
Where you shouldn't have been messing
Now someone else is getting all of your best

These boots are made for walking
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you

You keep lying
When you outta be truthing
You keep losing
When you outta not bet
You keep saming
When you outta be changing
What's right is right
But you ain't been right yet

These boots are made for walking
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you

You keep playing where you shouldn't be playing
You keep thinking that you'll never get burnt
I've just found me a brand new box of matches
And what it knows you ain't had time to learn

These boots are made for walking
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you

Are you ready, boots?
Start walking
