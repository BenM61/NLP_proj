We are fighting for your lives
Oh, we are the soldiers in the line of fire

Down in the trenches we wait for the night
The time is approaching
We're ready to strike

We'll stop at nothing
There's no holding back
Born to raise hell
We will attack

Pounding away
Tearing through flesh
Soldiers of metal
Fight to the death

Blasting the cannons
Shaking the ground
Hacking and killing
We're not fooling around

Warriors in battle
All dressed in black
A slash and a thrust
A stab in the back

The rages of fury
The cause of the fight
We're soldiers of metal
And we rule the night
Yeah
