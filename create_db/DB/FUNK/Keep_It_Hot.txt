Good things come to those who stay on their toes
So don't ever stop, always keep it hot

Oww! Oww, oww!  
Baby! because I like what you do to me
Baby! because I like it and its all for me

I like my friends exciting, if they keep my fever rising
Cause I always like to keep it hot
Little girl, come to play and i'll bet you want to stay
And I guarantee I'll hit the spot

You be good to me I'll be good to you
Anything you want anything you do
I've got my eyes on you, and I intend to
Give it all I got and to keep it hot

Oww! Oww, oww!
Baby! Tell all your friends that we're moving on the one
Baby! If you can take it you'll have more than enough

I hear plenty people talking, but those same people are walking
But they still try to tell me how to keep it hot
But girl you stick with me and with both our eyes we'll see
It's not very hard to keep it hot - I just know what I know

Let us take a chance, to enjoy romance
Life can be a 10 if you let love in
Here's all you have to do to make it pour right through
Give the best you've got and we'll keep it hot

Oww! Oww, oww! 
Baby! and I really want to know
Baby! let's not pretend let's get on with the show
