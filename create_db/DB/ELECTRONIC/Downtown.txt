Your face never saw the sites the bright lights 
The walls that always invite 
Get it right no more fight 
You'll be there up all night 
I'll give you a bus ride a pox slide a High rise full of surprises 
Smith path
Follow track 
All the way to my flat 

Come with me come with me come with me come with me there 

Cause I wanna take you down town 
Show you my thing, show you my thing 
Cause I wanna take you down town 
Show you my thing, show you my thing

Touched a monolith and it caused a hysrteria 
You keep on pinin' for me to go dinin' I Had me a meal and that keep me belly from whinin' 

Come with me come with me come with me come with me there

Flags for wavin' 
Clubs for ravin' 
Roads for pavin' 
Rivers for sailin' 
Stores unveilin' 
Walls for scalin' 
Temples for wailin'
