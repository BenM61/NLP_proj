Open Your Eyes, The Day Is Growing Near.
Wasted Away, Sleeping Off The Years.
Been Around, Stuck Around Far Too Long,
Run Away, Hide Away, I Was Wrong.
Couldn't See, Only Mee, Ahh, Too Bad.
Now I Know, How I Know, You'll Stay The Same. 

Give What You Have,Can I Know When I
Left It Too Late Guess I'll Never Know Just Why.
Been Around, Stuck Around Far Too Long.
Run Away, Hide Away, I Was Wrong.
Couldn't See, Only Me, Ahh,Too Bad.
Now I Know, How I Know, You'll Stay The Same. 

What Did I Lose, Going My Way.
Taking No More, The Light From My Day.
Been Around, Stuck Around, Far Too Long.
Run Away, Hide Away, I was Wrong.
Couldn't See, Only Me, Ahh, Too Bad.
Now I Know, How I Know, You'll Stay The Same. 

You'll Stay The Same!
