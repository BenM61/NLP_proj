Everybody looks so spaced out there
Busy blowing to the priests of noise.
Turn it up and make it drown out the warning
Bad news for the girls and boys.
Everybody looks so romantic
Acting like it's nothing at all.
Looking out for number one
Working for the week and living to the beat.
Dance this world away - dance this world away -
Dance this world away - dance this world away.
I see people all dressed like Nero
Fiddling while Rome burns in strife.
Personal responsibility zero
We've lost that rhythm of life.
There's a shadow in our bright horizon
It won't be manna falling out of the sky.
The hard rain hits everyone
Working for the week and living to the beat.
Dance this world away - dance this world away - . . .
Dance this world away - dance this world away - . . .
Somewhere there is a ship that's sinking
Why do I think that nobody knows?
Looking out for number one
Working through the week and dancing to the back beat.
Dance
Dance
Dance this world away - dance this world away - . . .
Dance this world away - dance this world away - . . .
Dance - dance this world away - dance this world away - . . .
Dance this world away - dance this world away - . . .
Dance this world away - dance this world away - . . .
Dance!
