They can't keep a good man down (yeah)
All these people smile, but they won't me to frown
Gettin' by when I shot 'em nine rounds
They will never ever take my crown (let's get to the song)

Thinkin they know, but no man will touch
Things gettin' better when I thought it would get worse
Here comes an officer who askin' for a search
Found a weapon it's up to me to clap first

I know why'all niggaz is second guessin' the state I'm in
Bitch, I'm in to makin' hit records that spin like rims
So when "Flex" get it, he bomb it once, shit bomb it twice
New York city pop your thoughts, turn off your lights
And "50" you have it, cause when Rule' spit to the masses
I got yo attention like J-Lo's ass

I know why'all niggaz is second guessin' the state I'm in

New York city pop your thoughts, turn off your lights

And "50" you have it, 'cause when Rule' spit to the massed
I got yo attention like J-Lo's ass
And if it's pussy we talkin' I come to smash em'
Personal foul like cole, when I sexual harass em'

'Cause bitches want you beat it with passion
Niggaz want to you to clip up and clap em'
And hide the body like nuthin' happened
Niggaz need to get they money and stick to rappin'

Or end up like one of the Jackson's beware of your actions
'Cause you don't want to meet that desert e'
With that hair pin trigger so easy to squeeze
And no matter how you cut me I'm always chesse
Like "Black" said, It's a hundred niggaz, seventy degrees muthafucka'

You know they can't keep a real nigga down (no)
Not what they niggaz can even wash up it's federal
Comin and puttin snicthes on a pedestal, glorify
Had to put niggaz in jail fo' life, ain't no blood in they eye

But who, Ja' bless 'em with tha sizzla touch
Thing's gettin better when they thought it would get worse
I bomb first, and breath in the heat, knowin to hell I send em'
And I ain't talkin' devils or demons, just be happy ya breathin

And cowards go to hiccupin' and sneezin'
Leavin every soul cold, and bodies never a day old
Drving down on a yayo and dump it, like f*ck it
Niggaz addict to hutslin, no one can ever be trusted

Who told the feds' to rush ya
Why you fishin' in darken looking for sharks to wise
Coast to coast man
Just look around Rule' will never back down
And why'all can never ever take my crown (niggaz)

You know they can't keep a real nigga down (no)
Not what they niggaz can even wash up it's federal
Comin and puttin snicthes on a pedestal, glorify
Had to put niggaz in jail fo' life, ain't no blood in they eye

Yeah, Yeah, That's what the f*ck I'm sayin..
Talk to 'em baby
Tell theses niggaz, what these niggaz know?
You know niggaz, no man touch this muthfucka right here
(Ya hear me?)
Niggaz going in they dreams to f*ck with me, be	
Murder inc (shit) Holla
Murder inc yeah murder inc
It's murder inc., we do this shit, we do this thang'
This thang called.,this thang we call drugs nigga
In the booth, lyrically
I get's the job done you know me baby
Holla back, Rule
