Strollin' in the park, watching winter turn to spring
Walkin' in the dark, seein' lovers do their thing

That's the time I feel like making love to you
That's the time I feel like making dreams come true

Oh baby

When you talk to me, when you're moanin' sweet and low
When you touch my hand and my feelin's start to show

That's the time I feel like making love to you
That's the time I feel like making dreams come true

In a restaurant, holdin' hands by candlelight
When I'm touchin' you
Wanting you with all my might

That's the time I feel like making love to you
That's the time I feel like making dreams come true

Strollin' in the park, walking in the dark
That's the time I feel like making love
When you talk to me, when you're touching me
Making my dreams come true

Strollin' in the park, walking in the dark
That's the time I feel like making love
When I talk to you, when I'm touching you
Making my dreams come true

That's the time I feel like making love to you
That's the time I feel like making dreams come true
