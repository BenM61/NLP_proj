Hello, good evening, how do you do?
We live lives of gifted few
You stand by me in my hands
You're the beautiful, the grand

Colorful girls in different dresses
On the waterfront so expensive
Stand in the cold and shiver
With a message to deliver

She sends a message, coming through loud and clear
She sends a message, even though you're not there
Like a secret code that nobody knows
She just wants to tell you who
The message is you
Do do n do

Lets her hair down for a picture
Sends it to you nationwide
Looks at herself in the mirror
Knows of nothing there to hide

She sends a message, coming through loud and clear
She sends a message, even though you're not there
Just like a secret code that nobody knows
She just wants to tell you who
The message is

In the city, I stand in place
Of the message with her face
From every side she radiates
From every side she radiates

Where we go, no one follows
On the waterfront, stand and stare
At the girls in different dresses
And their message so expensive

She sends a message, coming through loud and clear
She sends a message, even though you're not there
Just like a secret code that nobody knows
She just wants to tell you who
The message is you
Do do n do
The message is you
Do do n do
The message is you
Do do n do
The message is you
Do do n do
