There's an empty place beside me
When I'm walking down the street
That's the place where you used to walk
The place where you held my hand
Now I reach and all I touch is this
An empty, empty place

Sadness and tears, that's all you left me
They're such bad souvenirs
Of a love that once was, oh, so very great
The greatest love, reaching all the way to the stars above

But now there's not a star left in the sky
And if you don't come back to me I'll die
Only your embrace can fill this empty place

If I don't fill this emptiness
I know that I'll lose my mind
Looking out and only seeing space
An empty, empty place

Ah, sadness and tears, that's all you left me
They're such bad, bad souvenirs
Of a love that once was, oh, so very great
The greatest love, reaching all the way to the stars above

But now there's not a star left in the sky
And if you don't come back to me I'll die
Only your embrace can fill this empty place

Come back, come back, come back to me
Come back and fill my empty arms
I need your loving, darling
Your lips are loving, darling

Come back, come back, come back to me
Oh, come back and fill my empty arms
I need your loving, darling
Your lips are loving, darling
Come back, come back, come back to me
