First off I am not a rapper, second off we are not the same
Third thing, all you bitch niggas on the internet, you should be ashamed
Closet full of Alexander Wang
Louis loafers, you can say I changed
Louis jacket just to block the rain
Eatin' lobster bisk with some champagne
RIP to Bankroll
Shit all day been chasin' bankrolls
I ain't even change, I'm in the same clothes
Young wild nigga these hoes can't expose
Young wild nigga that came in on fleek
Gotta get that lil bitch out my sheets
Uber outside, I see you next week
Uber XL, you know a nigga cheap
Pull up to your function ridin' in that foreign car
Shawty f*ck me off that co-co, feel like Pablo Escobar
Ain't no pressure I'mma still accept your ass for who you are
Now just hop in my jacuzzi lose the panties and that bra

(Oh-oh)
Bitch I'm that dude
King of Pro Tools
I am so rude
Feel like Goku
Lunch at Nobu
Don't do tofu
Say he know me but I don't know old dude
Why you trippin' man I swear she old news
Stop that bitchin' girl you know you mine
Rollin' stone, get my Rollie on
Rollin' raw cone, drinkin' red wine
But these niggas still know what's happenin'
I'm not just rappin'
Expressin' my emotions through some Goddamn captions
Ridin' through the city and I'm Goddamn packin'
'Cause I wish a nigga would nigga I'm Goddamn lappin'
On my way baby wish me well
Young nigga finally came out that shell
I'm the motherfuckin' truth bitch, you can't tell

I got my change up
I got my name up
I wish a nigga tried to tell me that I change up
These bitches dangerous
F*ck me like I'm famous
Bought a brand new foreign so I had to switch my lane up
Change up
I got my change up, I got my change up, I got my change up
These bitches dangerous
F*ck me like I'm famous
Tell me why you hatin' 'cause a nigga switched his lane up
Let's get it

Bitch I'm on, they can't help but hate
A round table with a full plate
Bobby in here, finest night chef
Shoutout Oak Hill
Came in so swift
Tokyo drift
Now I'm ridin'
Green on me add a thousand dollars
Young nigga got his money pilin'
When I seen a mil' bitch I started robbin'

I got my change up
I got my name up
I wish a nigga tried to tell me that I change up
These bitches dangerous
F*ck me like I'm famous
Bought a brand new foreign so I had to switch my lane up
Change up
I got my change up, I got my change up, I got my change up
These bitches dangerous
F*ck me like I'm famous
Tell me why you hatin' 'cause a nigga switched his lane up
