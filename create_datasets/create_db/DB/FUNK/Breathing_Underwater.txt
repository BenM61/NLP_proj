The words
In water
The words
In water

Material
Slowly unwind
As I leave feathers behind
For your love
For your lover to find

Warm hands
Wrapped in blue linen
From Torrington
For your love
For your lover to find

Wild rose
Jericho sun
And, everyday stone
For your love
For your lover to find

Aorta
Tied to the artery
With a cute artistry
For your love
For your lover to

Find
Breathing, breathing underwater
Bre-Breathing
Breathing underwater

Pleasure
Melting your snowflake
Of lace down your face
For your love
For your lover to find

I could
Call your demons aside
Soak them in
Chamomile
For your love
For your lover
To find

Breathing, breathing underwater

I could
Bre-Brea
Breathe underwater

To find
For your love, for your lover to find

Breathing underwater

For your love
For your lover
Your love
For your love, woah oh

For your love
For your lover
Your love
For your love, woah oh

For your love
For your lover
Your love
For your love, woah oh

For your love
For your lover
Your love
For your love, woah oh

For your love
For your lover

For your love
For your lover
For your love
For your lover
For your love
For your lover

I want you to breathe it in
The words
In water
The words
In water
