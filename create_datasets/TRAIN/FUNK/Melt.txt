Whatever happens
You know we're gonna repair
No matter what happens
You know we've got something rare

We started with nothing, grew into something
We've got the heat
To last a lifetime, this is the right time
Trust in me
Take it from someone, who's not a tough one, oh
No matter what happens
No matter what happens

We've got the heat
Melt with me
You know we've got the heat
Melt with me

Whatever happens
You know we've got something real
No matter what happens
You know I'm gonna watch you near
So get over here

We started with nothing, grew into something
We've got the heat
To last a lifetime, this is the right time
Trust in me
Over the motions, this isn't over, oh
No matter what happens
No matter what happens

We've got the heat
Melt with me
You know we've got the heat
Melt with me, oh

Come melt with me
Come melt with me
Come melt, come melt, come melt with me
Come melt, come melt, come melt with me
Come melt, come melt, come melt with me

You know we've got the heat, oh
Melt with me
Yeah, we've got the heat
So melt with me
Oh, you know we've got the heat, yeah
(We've got the heat)
So melt with me
(Melt with me)
Oh oh, we've got the heat
(We've got the heat)
So come on melt with me
(Melt with me)

Come on, melt with me
Come on, melt with me
Come on, melt with me
Come on, melt with me
Mmm, mmm
