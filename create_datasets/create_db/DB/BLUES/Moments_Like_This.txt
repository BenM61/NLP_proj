Moments like this make me thrill through and through
Careless moments like this close to you
Nonchalantly we'd dine and we'd dance
Yet my heart seems to melt in your grace

Sweet moments like this with the soft lights aglow
Make me long for your kiss though I know
I'd be just one of all your affairs
But at moments like this, who cares

I'd be just one of all your affairs
But at moments like this, who cares.
