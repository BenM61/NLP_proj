No one expected the unexpected (uh uh)
Nawumsaying?  
Something real, something you could feel (that's right)
Straight from the Suave House (Bad Boy)
Representing (no doubt)
Put a little soul in here
And we don't stop

No one has to ask who be actin' bad 
Eightball and MJ pimpin' G be all up in that ass 
From Memphis Tenn, around the world and than back again 
Make non-rappin' weak MC's go home practicing 
I flip a Benz, will Lorenzo play and plenty Benjamins 
Low key, plenty ends makes plenty friends 
Baby, I got all the herbs that I need to chief 
Smoke up a pound and leave you bitch niggas in disbelief 
Inhale the smoke and every word I wrote came out dope 
Not like that crack, I being lyrical dope above tracks 
Not sayin' I won't pull the Rueger and put hollow to ya 
Have yo mama on her knees screamin' Hallelujeh 
Lay it down playa, Suave House, Bad Boy, Fat Boy 
And her friends the Rat-A-Tat boy
Matter of fact boy, this is not a act boy 
The player way, keep the player makin' stacks boy 

Everything that I do be all about the loot 
I been kickin' up dust in my Polo boots 
Gettin' blowed on the droll, takin' smoke up my nose 
I give the world to a woman, but I don't love hoes 
I'm a player, baby and don't you forget 
You need to get with it, let me hit it and split it 
In the bed, on the floor, hot tub, everyday 
The player way, the player way 

Now on, on, break o' dawn, can't stop, I'm too hot 
Look shit, my niggas rock, hype man be in the drop 
Me no care if the B's be tinted, you won't see me in it 
'Less there's TV's in it 
I can tell by the way you talk and the way you chit-chat 
You foul and if you had styles you wouldn't get back 
You thinkin' you invincible, you ain't hard to get at 
I know everywhere you go, everywhere you live at 
I be wanna click-clack and you be ready to get back 
I be ready to go to war, you ain't gon' be with that 
You be the same cat that I run up on and spit at 
Bleedin' all crazy and don't know where you hit at 
I'm dead up, niggas doin' drama better shut up, I'm fed up 
Know for my Roley I was set up 
I can't let up, you in some shit that don't concern you 
Send a bullet through your thermal, you know crazy 

Everything that I do be all about the loot 
I been kickin' up dust in my Polo boots 
Gettin' blowed on the droll, takin' smoke up my nose 
I give the world to a woman, but I don't love hoes 
I'm a player, baby and don't you forget 
You need to get with it, let me hit it and split it 
In the bed, on the floor, hot tub, everyday 
The player way, the player way

I've been waiting 20 minutes baby 
Now drop yo drawers
And do something outstandin' with yo jaws
After all this waitin' I can see clean through yo forehead 
You mo' said than done, give mo' head than some 
Throw my jacket down in the puddle, hell no 
If you don't know a pimp, somebody besta tell y'all 
Yeah the women say it's good to have a confidant 
But yet and still they give it up to pimps, once a month 
See a lot of these pimp lovers, they took they K-man 
Front like they real and hold a fake in 
You wastin' the time 
Serious ballas and ready hoes, got da women walkin' 
Dibs on da strip with steady toes 
As I pull up, cranking is thinking the bigger fat, natural expertise 
Plenty money workin' for G and whoever next to me 
And I ain't gonna rest till we made a statement
I'm straight up you want it down? It's time for a replacement 

Everything that I do be all about the loot 
I been kickin' up dust in my Polo boots 
Gettin' blowed on the droll, takin' smoke up my nose 
I give the world to a woman, but I don't love hoes 
I'm a player, baby and don't you forget 
You need to get with it, let me hit it and split it 
In the bed, on the floor, hot tub, everyday 
The player way, the player way
