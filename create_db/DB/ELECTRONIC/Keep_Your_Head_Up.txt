I've been waiting for so long
You don't even know how long
I have been waiting for this day, hey

I've been thinking about
All the reasons I had to get even
And to cause you pain, oh

And I bet they all would say
The girl is justified, oh
But all I'm gonna do is turn
And walk away tonight
To-ni-ni-night

Though I don't want to
And I don't need to
Be taking the fight
I'm lady-like
I'm not gonna stop

Oh, I don't want to
And I don't need to
But no matter how hard it gets
My mama always says to

Keep your head up
Your head up, your head up
Your head up, up

And no matter what
Your head up
Your head up
Your head up, up, up, up, up

I've had all kinds of fantasies
Even romantacy's
Of what to do when
The time was right, right

You would beg me for mercy
Told me you ain't worth it
And boy, I'd even make you cry, oh

It would be so easy now
To make you feel so bad, so bad
But all I'm gonna do is bite my lip
And leave it at that
At that, that, that

Though I don't want to
And I don't need to
Be taking the fight
I'm lady-like
I'm not gonna stop

Oh, I don't want to
And I don't need to
But no matter how hard it gets
My mama always says to

Keep your head up
Your head up
Your head up
Your head up, up, up

And no matter what
Your head up
Your head up
Your head up, up, up, up, up

Oooooo

I really don't have the time
Because you're really no friend of mine
I really should make you pay

Though I don't want to
And I don't need to
Be taking the fight
I'm lady-like
I'm not gonna stop

Oh, I don't want to
And I don't need to
But no matter how hard it gets
My mama always says to
(Keep your head up)

Though I don't want to
And I don't need to
Be taking the fight, (taking the fight) I'm lady-like
I'm not gonna stop

Oh, I don't want to
And I don't need to
But no matter how hard it gets
My mama always says to

Keep your head up
(Always said)
Your head up
(Always said)
Your head up
Your head up, up

And no matter what
Your head up
Your head up
Your head up, up, up, up, up
