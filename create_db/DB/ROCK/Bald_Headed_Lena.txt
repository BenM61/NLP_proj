Bald Headed Lena
Has anybody seen her
Cute as she can be
She's got a cue ball head
That's hard as lead
But she's all right with me

Bald Headed Lena
Has anybody seen her
Cute as she can be
She can't wear no wig
Cause her head's too big
But she's all right with me

Tricky Tessie, Messy Bessie
Both gals are full of stuff
Mella Ella, Crazy Stella
Both them gals are tough
Now you take Daisy
She's so crazy
Don't know night from day
Silly Tilly, Lyin' Lily
Take them all away

Sloppy Gerty, she's so dirty
Skinny Minnie she's too lean
Tracy's face is out of place
And Joanie's down right mean
Now you take Lizzie
She's so dizzy
She went and lost her mind
Ella Mae might save the day
but she's deaf dumb and blind
