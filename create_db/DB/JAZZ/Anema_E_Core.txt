My life I'd give for you, Anema E Core
I only live for you, Anema E Core
I have but one desire and it's to love you
With all my heart, with all my soul, my whole life through
From stars I'll make your crown and kneel before you
I pray you'll take my hand, for I adore you
Open up the doors leading to heaven
A heaven mine and yours, Anema E Core

My life I'd give for you, Anema E Core
I only live for you, Anema E Core
I have but one desire and it's to love you
With all my heart, with all my soul, my whole life through
In every dream I stand breathless before you
I pray you'll take my hand, for I adore you
Open up the doors leading to heaven
A heaven mine and yours, Anema E core
