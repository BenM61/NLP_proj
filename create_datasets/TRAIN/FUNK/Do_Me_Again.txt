Oh it feels so good being here with you yes
Being close to you is what I wanna do yes
Just can't seem to get enough of your love, baby
The way you do the thing you do, what a rush

Every bit of you is what I need
So don't hold back, not on me

In the morning and all through the night
I move my stars by candlelight
Do me (do me again) oh yeah
Give me all your fantasies
Have mercy, no don't mercy me
Do me (do me again)

I have to go but I can't get my self together
As long as you keep giving good love the way you do
What I have to do just have to wait
Right now I just can't leave you

In the morning and all through the night
I move my stars by candlelight
Do me (do me again)Oh yeah
Give me all your fantasies
Have mercy, no don't mercy me
Do me (do me again)

Do me
In the morning
Come on
All through the night
Sugar
Do me

Every bit of you is what I need
So don't hold back, not on me

In the morning and all through the night
I move my stars by candlelight
Do me (do me again)Oh yeah
Give me all your fantasies
Have mercy, no don't mercy me
Do me (do me again)
