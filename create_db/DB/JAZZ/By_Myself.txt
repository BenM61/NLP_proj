The party's over, the game is ended, 
the dreams I dreamed went up in smoke.
They didn't pan out as I had intended; 
I should know how to take a joke.

I'll go my way by myself, this is the end of romance. 
I'll go my way by myself, love is only a dance. 
I'll try to apply myself and teach my heart to sing. 
I'll go my way by myself like a bird on the wing,
I'll face the unknown, I'll build a world of my own; 
No one knows better than I, myself, I'm by myself alone.
I'll go my way by myself, here's how the comedy ends. 
I'll have to deny myself love and laughter and friends.
Grey clouds in sky above have put a blot on my fun. 
I'll try to fly high above for a place in the sun.
I'll face the unknown, I'll build a world of my own; 
No one knows better than I, myself, I'm by myself alone
