I met a Puerto Rican girl on a Sunday, heh
Stood in her house until Monday
Tuesday she fell in love with me
And by Friday she one of my baby

You see her boyfriend always used to treat her badly
(Why?)
Because she used to play it dirty
(Oh)
One day she'll do the same to me
But for now I'm takin it easy

(Brooklyn)
Who stole my girl, went out, wasn't lookin'

That punk tried to play me out
But I'ma set him up on the right road, yeah

You see I'm catchin' him at the local disco
It doesn't matter if it's New York or Frisco

And when it's over the subject is dead

Hangin' with my friends but I'm hardly ever with um
If I have static I just drop a dime
(What's up?)
And they're with me in no time

And when I swing

And when we throw

Throw up your hands and just say ho
