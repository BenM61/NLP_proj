One, two, three, four

Changes come,
Turn my world around
Changed come,
Turn my world around

I have my father's hand
I have my mother's tongue
I look for redemption in everyone

I want to wear your ring
I have a song to sing
It ain't over babe
In fact it's just begun

Changes come,
Turn my world around
Changes come,
Bring the whole thing down

I want to have our baby
Some days I think that maybe 
This old world's too fucked up 
For any first-born son

There is all this untouched beauty
The light, the dark
Both running through me
Is there still redemption for everyone?

Changes come,
Turn my world around
Changes come,
Bring the whole thing down

Jesus come,
Turn the world around
Lay my burden down
Turn this world around
Bring the whole thing down
Bring it down
