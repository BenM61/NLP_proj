Many muscles has the man 
Each one has a reason 
Many women felt his hand 
Each one trying to please him 
Imagine one day the tables could turn 
Imagine one day the tables would turn 
Behind every good woman lies a trail of men 
Shame shame for the rooster. Hi five for the hen 
Don't ask where she's going don't ask where she's been 
Behind every good woman lies 
A trail of men. 
Something tells me that Snow White 
Is smarter than we think. 
Seven men at perfect height 
Seven noses pink 
Could happen One day the tables could turn 
Imagine one day the tables would turn 
Behind every good woman lies a trail of men. 
Shame shame for the rooster. Hi five for the hen. 
Don't ask where she's going don't ask where she's been 
Behind every good woman lies a trail of men. [Repeat: x1]
Shame shame for the rooster nudge nudge for the hen 
Don't know where where it started or when it will end 
Behind every good woman lies 
A trail of men. a trail of men 
You wouldn't believe the mess she's in
