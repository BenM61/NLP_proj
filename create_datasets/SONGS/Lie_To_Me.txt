I can see a storm and it's coming my way.
I think I'm gonna drown if you say what you say
Just tell me I'm the only one
That you think about when I'm not around, yeah
And I don't wanna know what I already know.
Just keep it to yourself leave me out in the cold.
Never let the words come out.
Keep 'em locked inside and just let 'em die.

Say there's only me
So it won't be over
I can make believe
I want you to lie to me

I want you to
I want you to
I want you to lie to me

Ah ah

I'm better off not having to look or to hear
I know it's gonna cut me and bring me to tears
Can you try and think about all the better days?
Can you find that place, yeah
And do you understand why you want it to end?
Can you ask yourself again and again?
You never let the words come out
Keep 'em locked inside don't you let us die.

Say there's only me
So it won't be over
I can make believe
I want you to lie to me

I want you to
I want you to
I want you to lie to me

Ah ah

If you say something
I can make believe (If you lie)
If you say something
I want you to
I want you to lie
If you say something
I can make believe (If you lie)
If you say something
I want you to
I want you to lie to me
I want you to lie to me
