Lately I don't wanna see the morning sun
Lately I, I'm not much good to anyone
Lately I don't laugh the way I used to do
Lately I've been cryin', lately I've been missing you

Lately I don't wanna hear my favorite song
Lately I, I'm finding it hard to carry on
Lately everything I see is painted blue
Baby I've been dyin', baby I've been missing you

Lately I don't know why I ever let you go
I want you back, I need you back, without you it's all wrong
Baby make it right, bring your love back to my life
'Cause nothing's been the same since you've been gone

Lately I don't feel like talking to my friends
Lately I, I feel like this pain will never end
I don't want to go the places we went to, no no no
I don't feel like smiling, baby I'm just missing you

Oh baby I want you back, I need you back
Without you it's all wrong
Baby make it right, bring your love back to my life
'Cause I'm just not the same since you've been gone

Lately I don't want to see the morning sun
Lately I, I'm not much good to anyone
Lately I don't laugh the way I used to do, no no no no no
Lately I've been cryin', lately I've been dyin', oh yeah
Save me from this pain I'm goin' through
Lately I've been cryin'
I've been cryin', lately I've been missing, mising you, you
