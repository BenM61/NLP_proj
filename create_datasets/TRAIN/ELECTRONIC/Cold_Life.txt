Cold 
You know the yolk it's spreading from 
You laugh as people scatter 'bout 
Surrounded by a veil of stars 
You realize your life is dark 
Earth gets colder every day 
If scientists could have their way 
They'd study us from far away 
And watch as people's minds decay 
Cold 
Your body's in the hands of fools 
With swimming pools and low IQ's 
There's nothing to see, nothing to do 
Buy your stocks and sell your jewels 
Bill collectors stole my mail 
My wife and kids are all for sale 
I hope to god I go to jail 
And no one can come up with bail 
Cold life 
I can't control my buried thoughts 
The slightest thing makes me distraught 
I'm like the people I once fought 
My every action's being bought 
Robot trainers earn their pay 
As mutant kids go out to play 
It's such a pretty pretty day 
With orange nights and days of grey 

Cold 

I've now become a nervous wreck 
I'm getting closer to my death 
I keep expecting my last breath 
As all my friends just laugh and jest 

The earth is such a filthy place 
And human such an awful race 
And I'd rather live in outer space 
Where death goes at a slower pace 

Cold life 

I'm falling 

First last night we're riding home 
With friends in a big blue car 
For this man fed us rubbish 
As if it were caviar 
We told him; 'sir, please go away! 
We're innocent of crimes!' 
He hit me with his black nightstick 
And all I heard were cries 

I'm falling 

I asked her for a date one night 
She thought it'd be a laugh 
I'd take her to a restaurant 
And then up to her pad 
I waited at my house that night 
For her phone call to come 
She'd gone off with a ruffian 
And he came by with a gun 

I'm falling 

I'm falling 
Yes I'm falling
