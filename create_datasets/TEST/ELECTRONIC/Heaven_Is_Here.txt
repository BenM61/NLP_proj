Good times and bad times
There's noting I forget
Sun shines on our lifelines
There's noting I'll regret

Hold me and feel me
And wrap your arms around
'Cause when you love me I'm quite clear
That heaven is here

Hear my confession
We're meant to be as one
Leave me to the mystery
Of happiness to come

Touch me I'll give
My blessings and desire
'Cause when you feel eternal fire
Then heaven is here

Bad times and street crimes
No matter where you go
Some secrets preach and some fools teach
They're giving us some show

So send me an angel
And wrap your arms around
'Cause when it all comes down you'll know
That heaven is here
