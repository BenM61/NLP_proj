Thank you God
For this great opportunity
To Share with you exactly how I feel
I'm not well
And I Think that I should tell you
That I got the raw end of the deal
Don't get me wrong
Cause it's not like I blame you
But sometimes things get crazy on their own
I'm ashamed
Of the way I point my finger
Cause deep down I have reaped what I have sown

Life is hard
But so is everything
Give my regards to a man who cares
If I succeed
I will save my fellow man
And if I fail I'll just stand and stare

Such is life, Lord
And I know that you're aware
That you're a drug to me
A drug, within my fear
But, I Love you
A junkie to your silence
A wise man who's words, I'll never hear
What to do
I feel as if I'm floating
Not aware or in control of what I am
God bless me
Take me out of this existence
End my role as the sacrificial lamb

Life is hard
But so is everything
Give my regards to a man who cares
If I succeed
I will save my fellow man
And if I fail I'll just stand and stare

I'll just stand and stare

Life is hard
But so is everything
Give my regards to a man who cares
If I succeed
I will save my fellow man
And if I fail I'll just stand and stare

Life is hard
But so is everything
Give my regards to a man who cares
If I succeed
I will save my fellow man
And if I fail I'll just stand and stare

I'll just stand and stare
