You keep runnin' but there's no escape
You try move but your lying in the way
You look around and all your friends
Have been through what your doin'
And your doin' it all thinkin'

Everything is gonna change
But life ain't gonna wait you can fight it but you know it
Never will change ain't nothin' gonna change till you change

Your goin' out tonight been up two days
Your dead inside but your still awake
You walk around and everybody's tellin' you beautiful
And your doin' it all thinkin'

Everything is gonna change
But life ain't gonna wait you can fight it but you know it
Never will change ain't nothin' gonna change
Till you change so far away from your home
No voice of reason completely alone
You know your shadow won't keep you warm

Everything is gonna change
But life ain't gonna wait you can fight it but you know it
Never will change ain't nothin' gonna change till you change
