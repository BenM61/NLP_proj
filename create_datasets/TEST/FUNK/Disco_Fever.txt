Oh, take all of me, take all of me
Just the best part of me 
But baby, take all of me  
Why can't you see, why can't you see
That you're the only one for me
Baby take all of me 

I was sad and lonely with no one
To call my own
And then we met, one day,
You took my breath away
You told me not to cry
You loveable sweet - talking guy
But now it seems to me that
I'ts only gonna be
A part - time love that
You give to your...
No, no, no, no, no

I need your attention like
The flowers need the rain 
I'd leave my heart and soul 
In your complete control
If we could only share a sentimental 
Love affair
But now it seems to me that 
I'ts only gonna be
A part - time love that
you give to your...
No, no, no, no, no,no

Repeat
Repeat
Come and take, take all of me
Take all of me, take all of me...
