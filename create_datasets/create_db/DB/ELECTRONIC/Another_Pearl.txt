Why are you trembling so much,
I don't think I ever felt so good.
When all I need is to be free,
Where I love you and you love me.
Follow the circle sur le plage,
On a mono-colored trip voyage.
This is the color of my word,
Stay watch me find another pearl.

Follow the gold leaf trail back where,
We were young and had no care.
Tracing the circles that we made,
I don't want to live a life in shade.
Will this be a desert or a beach,
Or a place to find the things we need.

Now you and I make up perfect things,
Watch me trade my wheels for wings.
But don't ever use those wings to fly
Just the essence of a lullaby
Now I am a giant grain of sand
But I may be slipping through your hand
Follow my color coded world
And watch be find another pearl

It's a sound that I love
And it came from above
These's the sound of the sea
Are you following me

Let's walk to the sound of distant shells
To a place where life would have no end
You'd be the mother of my pearls
If you follow me into my world
Back to a place where I'd be free
Where I'd love you and you'd love me
This is the color of my world
Go watch me find another pearl
