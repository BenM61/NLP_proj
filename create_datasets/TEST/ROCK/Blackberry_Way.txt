Blackberry way 
Absolutely pouring down with rain 
It's a terrible day 
Up with the lark 
Silly girl I don't know what to say 
She was running away 
So now I'm standing on the corner 
Lost in the things that I said 
What am I supposed to do now 

Goodbye blackberry way 
I can't see you, I don't need you 
Goodbye blackberry way 
Sure to want me back another day 

Down to the park 
Overgrowing but the trees are bare 
There's a memory there 
Boats on the lake 
Unattended now for love to drown 
I'm incredibly down 
Just like myself they are neglected 
Turn with my eyes to the wall 
What an I supposed to do now 

Goodbye Blackberry Way 
I can't see you, I don't need you 
Goodbye Blackberry Way 
Sure to want me back another day 

Run for the train 
Look behind ya for she may be there 
Said a thing in the air 
Blackberry Way 
See the battlefields of careless sins 
Cast to the wind 
So full of emptiness without her 
Lost in the words that I said 
What am I supposed to do now 

Goodbye Blackberry Way 
I can't see you, I don't need you 
Goodbye Blackberry Way 
Sure to want me back another day 

Goodbye Blackberry Way 
I can't see you, I don't need you 
Goodbye Blackberry Way 
Sure to want me back another day 

Goodbye Blackberry Way 
I can't see you, I don't need you 
Goodbye Blackberry Way 
Sure to want me back another day
