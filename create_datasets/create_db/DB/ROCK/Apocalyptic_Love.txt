I got a real bad feeling
They'll be nothing to say
Whole world's going crazy
Know the end is on the way
But we've got one hot minute
To do anything you like
To do anything you like

This is the last time
Oh, oh
Don't care how we do it
Just as long as we can love under the same sky
All we got is tonight

I wanna feel you fallin' all up my thigh
Apocalyptic love
I wanna ride until we die
Until the last night's faded
I just wanna see you smile
I just wanna see you smile
As I go downtown

This is the last time
Oh, oh
Don't care how we do it
Just as long as we can love under the same sky
All we got is tonight
All we got is tonight

We'll dance under the burning sky
Watch it die
No sorrow, no sorrow
Together as the fire's rage
And erase tomorrow
Tomorrow
And when it's all said and done
We will have love
Until the very end of time

This is the last time
Oh, oh
Don't care how we do it
Just as long as we can love under the same sky
All we got is tonight
This is the last time
Oh, oh
Don't care how we do it
Just as long as we can love under the same sky
All we got is tonight
All we got is tonight
All we got is tonight
