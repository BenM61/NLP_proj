When I see you alone
I see what's in your mind
You love me yes you do
You don't need to tell me
I know you love me most
No one else take my place
You love me, yes you do
Forever, and ever

When we kiss
I see what's in your heart
You love me yes you do
You don't need to tell me
I know you love me most
No one else take my place
Believe me, you do
Forever, and ever

We are in love
Baby love child
I take you so high
Groovy love child
Give me a kiss
Baby love child
Do it again

We are in bed at night
I can see what you want
You want me yes you do
Aishiteimasu
I know how you feel
You have all of my heart
I give you myself
Forever and ever

We are in love
Baby love child
I take you so high
Groovy love child
Give me a kiss
Baby love child
Do it again
