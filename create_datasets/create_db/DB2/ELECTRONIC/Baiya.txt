You wanted, wanted all the

Glass eye, broken jaw
400 legs kick down my door
On my life I swear I saw, the city burn, the jackals crawl

Now I was dead before I hit the floor
I never stood a chance
A waste of sympathy, but all your
I'm not a saint, but you're a sin
I can feel you creeping

All hell is breaking loose
Do my fingers down my back
In the tracks, also don't look alike
From under you
All hell is breaking loose
As you're breathing down my neck
Tenderness is the only weapon left, I comfort you

You want it on the, on the, on the, on the
You want it on the

You cry-wolf, you get a, don't close your eyes, keep dreaming on

A waste of sympathy, but all your
I'm not a saint, but you're a sin
I can feel you creeping

All hell is breaking loose
Do my fingers down my back
In the tracks, also don't look alike
From under you
All hell is breaking loose
As you're breathing down my neck
Tenderness is the only weapon left, I comfort you

From under you
All hell is breaking loose
As you're breathing down my neck
Tenderness is the only weapon left, I comfort you

And now we're standing back to back, to back, to back, to back
On an only stage the players play on
And you turn around and see, see people, free people stream
Forever folding into you

All hell, all hell is breaking loose
Do my fingers down my back
In the tracks, also don't look alike
From under you
All hell is breaking loose
As you're breathing down my neck
Tenderness is the only weapon left, I comfort you
