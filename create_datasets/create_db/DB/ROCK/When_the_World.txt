We're coming close to sunrise
Lights burn red in your streets
Stay faithful
I'm sure of these feelings
We're coming close to sunrise
Lights burn red in your streets
Stay faithful
I'm sure of these feelings

When the world is no longer watching
When the world is no longer watching
Stay faithful to your drug
When the world is no longer watching
When the world is no longer watching
Stay faithful to your drug
People sell themselves
There's a fashion to their smiles
You often need comfort
Raising my eyes to you
People sell themselves
There's a fashion to their smiles
You often need comfort
Raising my eyes to you

When the world is no longer watching
When the world is no longer watching
Stay faithful to your drug
When the world is no longer watching
When the world is no longer watching
Stay faithful to your drug
People sell themselves
There's a fashion to their smiles
You often need comfort
Raising my eyes to you
People sell themselves
There's a fashion to their smiles
You often need comfort
Raising my eyes to you
