Working my way back to you babe
With a burning love inside
Yeah, I'm workin' my way back to you, babe
And the happiness that died
I let it get away, paying every day

When you were so in love with me
I played around like I was free
Thought I could have my cake and eat it too
Oh how I cried over losing you

For every day I made you cry
I'm paying girl til the day that I die
I'll keep working my way back to you babe
With a burning love inside
I'm working my way back to you babe
With a happiness that died
I let it get away, payin' every day

I used to love to make you cry
It made me feel like a man inside
But if I'd been a man in reality
You'd still be here babe lovin' me

Now the nights are long and lonely
And I'm not too strong babe I just miss you so
And you're too proud, won't give in
But when I think about all I could win

I keep working my way back to you babe
With a burning love inside
I'm working my way back to you babe
With a happiness that died
I let it get away, payin' every day

Yeah yeah yeah

Working my way back to you babe
With a burning love inside
I'm working my way back to you babe
With a happiness that died oh how I'm cryin'
Working my way back to you babe
With a burning love inside
