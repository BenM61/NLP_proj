Rain town in the nighttime
Endless yellow taxis
Waiting for the moment
When the party will end

Rain town in the nighttime
You still heard nothing from me
But I've become invisible so what message could I send?

Saturdays are lonely
And Sundays you're alone
Still checking for the signal
For the bars on the phone, phone, phone

You can travel for a thousand miles
You can spend a thousand nights alone
You can lose your way so easily and never ever make it home

So come out with me tonight, come out with me tonight
No one falls in love under fluorescent light
Come out with me tonight, come out with me tonight
No one falls in love under fluorescent light

No one's getting older
And nothing ever changes
And I will never lose you
And you'll never lose me

Just repeat that 'til I'm sleeping
And then stay with me 'til morning
And then I swear you can't erase me
And then I swear I set you free

I watch you put your coat on
I hear you close the bedroom door
And then there's nothing but the memory of the dream I had
That you don't love me anymore
Why don't you love me anymore?

You can tell me we were born alone
And you can say it wasn't meant to be
But if you wait until the lights come on
There's so much that you'll never see

So come out with me tonight, come out with me tonight
No one falls in love under fluorescent light
Come out with me tonight, come out with me tonight
No one falls in love under fluorescent light

3 A.M. and the lights go on,in the middle of the chorus they turn off our song
Everyone is wasted, everyone's alive
We hail a yellow taxi and we drive, drive, drive

You can travel for a thousand miles
You can spend a thousand nights alone
You can lose your way so easily and never ever make it home
Never ever make it home

So come out with me tonight, come out with me tonight
No one falls in love under fluorescent light
Come out with me tonight, come out with me tonight
No one falls in love under fluorescent light
No one falls in love under fluorescent light
