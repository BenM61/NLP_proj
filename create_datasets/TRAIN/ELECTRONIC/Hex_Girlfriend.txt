Friday flight feeling smeared and vexed
Girl caught, parking lot of the Cineplex
Stupid face looking so perplexed
Seeming like it was caught in a hex

"Does it make you, does it make you feel alright?"
"Did they make you, did they make you feel alright?"

Sullen sights always indirect
Tired eyes hypnotized by your teenage sect
Weekend rituals resurrecting
Feelings our sober minds reject

"Does it make you, does it make you feel alright?"
"Did they make you, did they make you feel alright?"

I know I won't be here forever
Slow burn fades into a dream
My flesh won't follow me forever
But your touch is far and few between
