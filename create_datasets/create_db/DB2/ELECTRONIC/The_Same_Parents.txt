We all had the same parents
Many million years ago
Why can't we live in freedom?
Without hunger, with no war

At the beginning we all had
One mother and one father
That's where we're descending from

Attention
I don't, I don't understand
Why so much hate?
Attention
Between races and religions

It's mad, insane
I don't understand
Amazing
Why it has to be like that?
Incredible experience
