I would die
I wouldn't sleep
I would cry
I would weep

When the night is coming
And I'm missing my babe
Knowing we're all in the same boat

So many oceans and so many fishes in one single pond
Knowing never what went wrong
So babe while I'm lying here
Thoughts they still linger in my head, but
Knowing we're all in the same boat

When the night is coming
And I'm missing my babe
Knowing we're all in the same boat

When the night is coming
When the night is coming
When the night is coming
And I'm miss my friend
Knowing we're all in the same boat

When the night is coming
And I miss you my babe
Knowing we're all in the same boat
