Sweet scent of a gentle rain, 
Will you ever come again?
Smooth skin, soft and white, 
We lose ourselves within the night

Dance inside the dreamer's circle, 
I'm waiting for you, 
Escape the life of black and white, 
I'm waiting for you

I wanna be the color that's in your life, 
And you make love electrical, 
Welcome to the festival (repeat)

Facing towards still rose dawn, 
Intuition leads you on
You're all dressed up in dreams, 
In a liquid limousine

Dance inside the dreamer's circle, 
I'm waiting for you, 
Escape your life of black and white, 
I'm waiting for you

I wanna be the color that's in your life, 
And you make love electrical, 
Welcome to the festival (repeat)

Dance inside the dreamer's circle, 
I'm waiting for you, 
Escape your life of black and white, 
I'm waiting for you

I wanna be the color that's in your life, 
And you make love electrical, 
Welcome to the festival (repeat)

Wanna be, the color, in your life, 
'cause you make love electrical, 
Welcome to, welcome to, welcome to the festival

I wanna be the color that's in your life, 
And you make love electrical, 
Welcome to the festival (repeat fade)
