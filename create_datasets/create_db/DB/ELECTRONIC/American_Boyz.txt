American girls stand tall but American boyz
American girls stand tall but American boyz
I saw a sweet set of eyes down in makeshift Hollywood
Where the black boys tap new york and the white guys wish they could
He was standing feet sweet looking good to go
I could swing this city but the traffic moves too slow
American boyz spit junk like you breed virtue
American boyz say look out here comes a fool
American boyz are sweet if you handle it trick or treat
American girls stand tall but American boyz
I saw some crying eyes down on see 'n' 79
There was a hitman on the phone he was try'na crush a friend of mine
Me and Merri were flying just above the flame
Oh Lord he was pretty but he loved to smoke cocaine
American boyz spit junk like you breed virtue, yeah
American boyz say look out here comes a fool
American boyz are so sweet but don't ever be too scared to speak
American girls stand tall but American boyz
Talking about American boys
I made out in the back of a yellow taxi
God it was cold but I took the safest route
I was high, heredity, all the lights poked fun at me
Acid makes you feel like you're in a movie
American girls stand tall but American boyz
American girls stand tall but American boyz
American girls stand tall but American boyz
American girls stand tall
American boyz spit junk like you breed virtue, yeah
American boyz say look out here comes a fool
American boyz are so sweet but don't ever be too scared to speak
American girls are cool but American boyz
American boyz are studs on the highway
And life is a quest without recreation
God is a beach so glad you could make it
American boyz one chance better take it
All American
All American boyz
How American is American?
