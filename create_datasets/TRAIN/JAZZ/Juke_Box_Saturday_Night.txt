Mopping up soda pop rickeys 
To our heart's delight 
Dancing to swingeroo quickies 
Jukebox Saturday night 

Goodman and Kyser and Miller 
Help to make things bright 
Mixing hot licks with vanilla 
Jukebox Saturday night 

They put nothing past us 
Me and honey lamb 
Making one Coke last us 
Till it's time to scram 

Money we really don't need bad 
We make out alright 
Letting the other guy feed that 
Jukebox Saturday night 

After sipping a soda we got a scheme 
Somebody else plays the record machine 
It's so easy to say pet names 
When you listen to the trumpet of Harry James... 

We love to hear that tenor croon 
Whenever the Ink Spots sing a tune... 
 
If I didn't know why the roses grow 
Then I wouldn't know why the roses grow... 
Now listen, honey child
If I didn't know all them little things I'm supposed to know 
Then I sure would be a sad man 
If I didn't know... 

Money we really don't need it 
We make out alright 
Letting the other guy feed that 
Jukebox Saturday night
