We poison our hearts
We poison our seas
We burn down the paradise

We're stoppin' good waves
We're losin' our trees
The future looks bright ahead
I don't wonder we'll go under in this river of lies oh oh oh

We're lost in this time we create so fine
The future we already fear
Seems like no way out, seems like there's no doubt
The future looks bright ahead

We're the kids of the century we're lost in our games
No time for the memories we look in the haze
We're the kids of the century it wasn't our fault
Everything's done mum, we fall
Let's keep on crying
But sometimes I don't want to fall
I don't want to fall sometimes I don't want to fall

Every time when you look around things will smile at you
Every time when you turn around you smell the truth
But you run away from the lies you can't say
Don't run away from the lies you can't say

We're the kids of the century we're lost in our games
No time for the memories we look in the haze
We're the kids of the century it wasn't our fault
Everything's done mum, we fall

We're the kids of the century we're lost in our games
No time for the memories we look in the haze
We're the kids of the century it wasn't our fault
Everything's done mum, we fall
Let's keep on crying
But sometimes I don't want to fall
I don't want to fall sometimes I don't want to fall
No, I don't want to fall sometimes I don't want to fall
