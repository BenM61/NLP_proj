Nobody knows when it all began
This kind of trouble between a woman and man
You know the nature of love brings pain
And you tell that you never want to feel that way again
And I seem to be at the heart of all of your problems

You cut me to the bone
Baby, you cut me to the bone
You know how to make a man feel
Alone the way you cut me to the bone

You've gone a long way from loving me
And now you're leaving me in misery
Forget about it, all that we've been through
You're gonna do the things you want to do
And you don't want to hear a single word I'm saying

You cut me to the bone
Baby, you cut me to the bone
You know how to make a man feel
Alone the way you cut me to the bone

Lost in a dream, that's what you are
One day you'll wake up and see you went too far
Along with the sunshine there will be some rain
But it was never meant to be in vain
And you don't want to hear a single word about it

You cut me to the bone
Baby, you cut me to the bone
You know how to make a man feel
Alone the way you cut me to the bone
You know how to make a man feel
Alone the way you cut me to the bone
