Thanks forever steeling,
Just when you get the feeling
That things could be alright
Call it a narrow escape,
Maybe it's your lucky day,
My mind is running dry

And when you see me now,
I tell you how I don't cry
God in my heart of hearts I know that it's just a lie
So send me your best regrets,

I haven't had everything yet 

Give me a reason to show,
Something to call my own,
Try me I've got all night
Say it were a narrow escape,
What else can I say,
I know you'll be alright

And when you see me now,
I tell you that I don't mind
But in my heart of hearts I know that it's just a lie
So send me your best regrets,
I haven't had everything yet

Explored every avenue, a dead end, every turn
You can't see your way out, nor can I
So send me your best regrets
