Spend spend spend is the line to take
Keep on buying it's no mistake
Get what you want whenever you can
Cause Mr. Bank Manager's a nice ol' man

When your flexible friend just don't want to know
And the bank that says yes starts to say no

Do a runner
Have it away on your toes

See your bank it's got plenty of dough
Get credit high and repayments low
Go and buy all the things that you needed
And who gives a damn if the limit's exceeded

Get you to court and they'll give you a fine
Stagger the payments to a nicker a time
You gotta plead poverty you got no dough
They're so stupid they just don't know
