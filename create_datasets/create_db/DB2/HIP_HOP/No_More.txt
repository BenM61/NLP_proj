I'm getting a little tired with you're broken promises(promises)
Lookin at you're pager seein different numbers and numbers
Call you on your cell you hangin with the fellas the fellas
Hanging with my girls you always gettin jealous and jealous
I was with ya when you didn't have no fellas and fellas
Hangin at your crib chillin with your mamma your mamma
Never found a dream never worth the drama the drama
Now your at the screen playin pleaz

No I'm not the one
Say it again say it again oh
No I'm not the one
You do or you don't

You do or you don't (don't)
You will or you won't (wont)
No more, no more baby I'm a do it right
You can or you can't (cant)
Be a man, be a man (man)
No more, no more baby I'm a do it right

You treat me like a lady when you open doors and doors
Then you want to fret when you're wit you're boys you're boys
How you gonna play me when I got you're clothes you're clothes
The ones that you'd wherin when you're wit you're doughes and doughes
I know you never thought that I would have the nerve the nerve

Think about it more since you at the cirb the cirb
Blowin at my pager say you wana chance a chance
Listen when I say it player pleaz

I just want to no
What happened to our love
We used to be best friends where did it go wrong
When you gonna see
How good it is for me
I'm tired and I'm through with all your messin babe

Yo yo yo
And you promised me case babe
But that was last year boy in the eighth grade
And you ain't Biggy baby boy
So no it ain't one more chance when you're friends around you don't want to hold my hand
And now you seein girls
Stylin while I'm inside the mix
Hoppin at the whips the whips a 5 or 6
Yes fly crone
So put in my tone
Here I go critical or Tyrone

You do or you don't
