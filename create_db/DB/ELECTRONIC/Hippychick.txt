It's hard to tell you how I feel without hurting you 
So try to think about yourself the way that I see you 
You're life revolves around the force of oppression 
And I won't deal with the true blue devils of correction 

Got no flowers for your gun 
No hippychick 
Won't make love to change your mind 
No hippychick 
No hippychick 
No, hip hip hip hip hip 

Today, we'll sit here drinking coffee in your incident room 
Tonight, you'll close the door and lock me in that bare bulb gloom 
Love, it ain't something riding on a motorbike 
And love, I stopped loving you since the miners' strike 

Got no flowers for your gun 
No hippychick 
Won't make love to change your mind 
No hippychick
No hippychick
No, hip hip hip hip hip hop 

It's hard 
It's hard 
It's hard 
It's hard 

No hippychick 
No hip hip hip hip hip 
No hippychick 
No hip hip hip hip hip 
No hippychick 
No hip hip hip hip hip 
No hippychick
