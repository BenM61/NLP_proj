Strollin' past the Daffodils
I won't forget how it feels
To be lost in the maze.

Laying on the sun kissed patch
Of grass we found round the back
Of that palace garden place 

There wasn't a cloud in sight,
Nor people strolling by.
You held your hand in mine and I sighed,
For there was not much
To be found in your eyes

Oh, of all the sights I've seen
Never knew it'd be you me and Buckley Bee
In the cool, warm shade.

And I should of kissed your face 
I should've explored all the places 
Ooh, oh my 
How you seem to make me shy 
Ooh, and every time you kiss me on the lips
I think of how I could get used to this.
Used to your kisses

So wakey, wakey, rise and shine 
So wakey, wakey, rise and shine,
T'was another lovely evening again last night
Honestly did I not oblige to your every whim,
Seen as I was beholden?

Ooh, oh my 
How you seem to make me shy 
Ooh, and every time you kiss me on the lips
I think of how I could get used to this 

So wakey, wakey, rise and shine 

Ooh, oh my 
How you seem to make me shy 
Ooh, and every time you kiss me on the lips
I think of how I could get used to this
