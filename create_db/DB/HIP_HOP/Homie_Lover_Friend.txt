If you don't know what homie lover friend is, check it out

A homie lover friend is what I'm looking for
A girl who can connect with the things I got in store
She can even kick back with da homies
Play spades, mackin' Aces and getting payed

Too much makeup is not a style
'Cause when it comes to parties you know she gets buckwild
Uh, shakin' that rump and thangs
Girl you make me wanna do some thangs

Like step up on you and freak you with the digits
Nine-five-five BONE and baby gets with it
So I send a shoutout to you 
Thanks for being my homie lover friend

Homie lover friend, yeah

Someone who can relate to my sex drive
Cuff her booty while we dance and she don't mind
And pickin' her up is obsolete
Because I see her at the club valeting her Jeep

She can turn a man into a mouse in a minute
Snappin' her fingers up and down and make you cool with it
Walkin' away, hummin' her favorite song
Ain't nothin' but the rip going on

We will be together for all times
I need a homie lover friend
A homie lover friend is what I'm looking for
Like "Damn R, them rims on your Benz is straight!"

A homie lover friend is somethin' inexpensive
You pay your way, I'll pay my way
Don't mind kickin' it with the homies when we hit the show
Or flex a cooler, while chillin' on the corner

Her ex wants to go strollin'
But she pages me to go bowlin'
But not quite the kind of balls that you're thinkin'
But the kind that be swingin' and swingin' and swingin'
Don't mind lookin' ugly when it's time to
Call me yummy yummy yummy y'all and it feels good
So if you see me push up on me 
And let me know you wanna be my homie, lover friend

Now, if you're a homie lover friend and you're out there
Just throuw your hands in the air like you don't care
And let me know I got the right one, baby
Then give me the chance to say I love you, sweet lady
Now watch my cars, here's the keys
While I get my ball on, takin' straight G's
Uh, but some think I'm wet
My homie girlfirend be temptin' me to bet
And so I sniggle as I reach into the pocket of my shorts
Showin' straight cash as I watch 'em clear the court
Rollin' away, countin' ends
On my way to Sizzler's, with my homie lover friend
