It's been so many years since we've been together
And you promised me that you'd be mine forever
I put my trust in you whole heartedly
Now it seems that you wanna leave me

Tell me where? Where did I go wrong?
I thought this love we had was very strong
Please don't make me beg you to stay
I'll always love you anyway

(I need you)
Need you
('Cause I'm missing you)
'Cause I'm missing you
(I'm missing you)

You see, I
(I need you)
Need you
('Cause I'm missing you)
'Cause I'm missing you
(I'm missing you)

(How soon we forget)
We forget
('Cause we forgot)
'Cause we forgot

(The love we had before)
The love we had before
(Doesn't exist no more)
Doesn't exist no more

(How soon we forget)
We forget
('Cause we forgot)
'Cause we forgot

(The love we had before)
I said, the love we had before
(Doesn't exist no more)

I toss and turn at night, wondering what to do
You're like a stranger with a different attitude
So for the last time, please don't make me beg you to stay
I know I'll always love you, love you anyway

(I need you)
Need you
('Cause I'm missing you)
'Cause I'm missing you
(I'm missing you)

You see, I
(I need you)
Need you
('Cause I'm missing you)
'Cause I'm missing you
(I'm missing you)

(How soon we forget)
We forget
('Cause we forgot)
'Cause we forgot

(The love we had before)
I said, the love we had before
(Doesn't exist no more)
Doesn't exist no more

(How soon we forget)
We forget
('Cause we forgot)
Woo, woo

(The love we had before)
I said, the love we had before
(Doesn't exist no more)
Doesn't exist no more

And I realize it every day
And I know I'm gonna love you
Gonna love you anyway

You are my joy and happiness
Oh, can't you see? Doo, doo
You are my joy and happiness
Oh, can't you see? Doo, doo

You know that I'm so in love with you
And I'm not ashamed to say it, no

(How soon we forget)
'Cause how soon we forget
('Cause we forgot)
Woo, woo

(The love we had before)
I said, the love we had before
(Doesn't exist no more)
Doesn't exist no more

You are my joy and happiness
Oh, can't you see? Doo, doo
You are my joy and happiness
Oh, can't you see? Doo, doo

It's killing me, well
You see, I'm not ashamed to say it, no

(How soon we forget)
'Cause how soon we forget
('Cause we forgot)
Woo, woo

(The love we had before)
I said, the love we had before
(Doesn't exist no more)
Doesn't exist no more

You are my joy and happiness
Oh, can't you see? Doo, doo
You are my joy and happiness
Oh, can't you see? Doo, doo

It's killing me, well
You see, I'm not ashamed to say it, no

(How soon we forget)
'Cause how soon we forget
('Cause we forgot)
Woo, woo

(The love we had before)
I said, the love we had before
(Doesn't exist no more)
Doesn't exist no more

'Can't you see
I feel such a pain in my heart?

(How soon we forget)
'Cause how soon we forget
('Cause we forgot)
Woo, woo

(The love we had before)
I said, the love we had before
(Doesn't exist no more)
Doesn't exist no more

(How soon we forget)
We forget
('Cause we forgot)
'Cause we forgot

(The love we had before)
I said, the love we had before
(Doesn't exist no more)
Doesn't exist no more

Can't you see
You mean the world to me?

(How soon we forget)
How soon we forget
('Cause we forgot)
Woo, woo

(The love we had before)
I said, the love we had before
(Doesn't exist no more)
Doesn't exist no more

Somebody help me get out of this mess
Well, it's killing me, I, I gotta get it out, well
How soon we forget, woo, woo
I said, the love we had before, had before
It doesn't exist no more
