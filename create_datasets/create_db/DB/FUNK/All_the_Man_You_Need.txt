I know you've been here before
There's a pain that you hold like a heart that's gone cold
Living your life alone, no matter what your friends say
It don't have to be that way

Let me love the hurt away
I know just what to do, I can satisfy you
You can open up to me
I'll show you what love can do, baby
(Yeah oh)

Put your hand in mine
Trust me, girl, you'll never find
I'll be all the man that you need
I'll take you to the highest height

Play with you and hold you tight
I'll be all the man that you need
I'll kiss you here, there, everywhere
Run my fingers through your hair

Can't you feel the man in me?
I'm talking not just for one night, girl
I want to spend my life
Being all the man that you need

I can make this house a home
A foundation of love, that's blessed from above
When you feel you can't go on
I'll be right there 'cause, baby, I care

Come hold your body close to mine
I want to feel your heartbeat, like it's inside of me
You and I were meant to be
Together like sweet harmony
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, I)

Put your hand in mine
Trust me, girl, you'll never find
I'll be all the man that you need
I'll take you to the highest height

Play with you and hold you tight
I'll be all the man that you need
I'll kiss you here, there, everywhere
Run my fingers through your hair

Can't you feel the man in me?
I'm talking not just for one night, girl
I want to spend my life
Being all the man that you need

No need to cry no more, I'll wipe your tears all away
I'll be the sunshine in your life, girl
I'll make it right more and more everyday
(More and more each day)

Let the light of love into your heart
If you believe it can lead the way
And in my arms you will find
Your peace of mind, baby, I'll never let go
(Ooh, oh)
Yeah, let me be your man

Put your hand in mine
Trust me, girl, you'll never find
I'll be all the man that you need
I'll take you to the highest height

Play with you and hold you tight
I'll be all the man that you need
I'll kiss you here, there, everywhere
Run my fingers through your hair

Can't you feel the man in me?
I'm talking not just for one night, girl
I want to spend my life
Being all the man that you need
