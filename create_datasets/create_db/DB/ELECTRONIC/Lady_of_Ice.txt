(A Lady of ice
A Lady of ice)

A lady of ice in a desert zone 
Where a web of lies has turned to stone.
A lady of ice with a painted smile 
I should keep her warm just for a while.

All I want is ecstasy, reaching for reality 
Love comes and sweeps your past away. 
We'll climb invincible mountains 
I want you never to be. 

A lady of ice in a desert zone 
Where a web of lies has turned to stone.
A lady of ice with a painted smile 
I should keep her warm just for a while.
A Lady of ice
A Lady of ice

All I want is holding you 
Huggin' and protecting you.
Turn up the beating of your heart. 
It's like a transmutation 
I want you never to be.
