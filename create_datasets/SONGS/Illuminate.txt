Would you that for taste
Or hard for me not even matter
In desire on a faith
Without fear would you go after
Somewhere you keep up your halo's
Get all what they don't know,
Open up your window shades
And illuminate, illuminate
Let nothing in your way, illuminate
Go on and shine on!
Go on and shine on!
Go on and shine on!
Go on and shine on!
Go!

Is your sanity poor?
'Cause you're starving for a reason
Make your sickness your cure
You invent what you believe in
Somewhere you keep up your halo's
Get all what they don't know
Open up your window shades
And illuminate, illuminate
Let nothing in your way, illuminate
Go on and shine on!
Go on and shine on!
Go!

And illuminate, illuminate
Let nothing in your way, illuminate!
Go on and shine on!
Go on and shine on!
Go on and shine on!
Go on and shine on!
Go!
