Promises you made me.
All the things you told me.
You said you'd never leave me.
We'd be together for eternity.
Now it's all in the past.
Now I know our love will last.
Lady, I will do all I can.
Lady, I will be all I am.
I'll give you all you had before,
So come on in and close the door.
Let me show you what I could be.
Could you just please tell me...

[Chorus]
Do you believe in love,
And the promise that it gives?
I want to love you for life,
'Cause your love is why I live.
Do you believe in love,
And the promise that it gives?
I want to love you for life,
'Cause your love is why I live.

I knew the thing, girl,
But my faith wasn't strong enough.
Now my heart is built to last.
My heart is beating for you, fast.
But now I know that you understand.
I want to take you by the hand,
And walk with you down that isle.
And with you, I'll live my life.
I give you all you had before, 
So come on in and close the door.
Let me show you what I could be,
If you just please tell me...

[Chorus]

I want you to know that it's for real,
This feeling that I feel.
I want you to know that it's so real.

[Chorus]
