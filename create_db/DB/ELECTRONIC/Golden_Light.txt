We met a summer night
And I held you tight
In the golden light

And ever since that time
I've been burnin' bright
A fire deep inside

I just wanna feel your love
I need your love
Wake me back to life

Give me give me one more night
And I'll hold you tight
In the golden light

In the golden light
In the golden light
In the golden light
In the golden light

I just wanna feel your love
I just wanna feel your love

We met a summer night
And I held you tight
In the golden light

And ever since that time
I've been burnin' bright
A fire deep inside

I just wanna feel your love
I just wanna feel your love
I just wanna feel your love

You were my only one
And we had some fun
To the jungle drums

But now those days are gone
And I'm dancing on
In the summer sun

I just wanna feel your love
I need your love
Wake me back to life

Give me give me one more night
And I'll hold you tight
In the golden light

In the golden light
In the golden light
In the golden light
In the golden light

I just wanna feel your love
I just wanna feel your love

We met a summer night
And I held you tight
In the golden light

And ever since that time
I've been burnin' bright
A fire deep inside

I just wanna feel your love
I just wanna feel your love
I just wanna feel your love
