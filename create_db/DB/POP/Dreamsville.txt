I'm in Dreamsville, holding you
A dreamy view, just we two alone
If love in Dreamsville, time is new
We're here to love and we do

We can see the rest of the world
Below us from our pink cloud

There's no boundary to this magic land
As we go exploring hand in hand
In dreamy Dreamsville
Far away and here we love
Here we stay

There's no boundary to this magic land
As we go exploring hand in hand
In dreamy Dreamsville
Far away and here we love
Here we stay
