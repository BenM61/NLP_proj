Urban organic, Mic mechanic
Super-human MC powers help me fly around the planet
Touch the microphone device, whole countries get flattened
Saving damsels in distress so young girls don't panic
Putting MCs under pressure till they crack like ceramic
Always thought they could flow but sink like the Titanic

Rhymes rip through your skull like icebergs through the hull
Survive the impact, and arctic cold freezes your soul
Create a new style, then break the mold
Compositions are controlled, and liable to explode
Like land mines, my crew blows through like wind chimes
Make it hot like fire, two hundred proof like Moonshine

Risky, playing yourself is risky
And the flows mad jazzy like Dizzy Gillespie
And the sound be harmonious and deadly
Like a harpy call either break one like Wayne Gretzky
No man can test me, so why try?
Focus like a samurai, stronger than a Maitai
Or a Tsunama...I mean Tsunami
I rock it from MTV, to the BBC

Radioactive waves short out your TV
LESB check it for me in the next galaxy
Put it in a time capsule till the next century
In a black out use it for electricity

Danger, high voltage
Don't feed me their daily dosage
I break it down mathematically, 99.9 is a percentage
Like closing fine wine the rhymes are vintage
And the universal will gives me strength like spinach

With dinage, I eat it like a tofu sandwich
With cabbage, I ask your girl, she knows that
I'm not the average...nigga...who plays to pull the trigga
Reality's the root of the rhymes that I configure
Phony...baloney, swear like Don Corleone
But when shit hit the fan they start crying like Pretty Tony
Tender like Roni...but wish to be bad like Bobby
Been there, done that, smashed up
Rockin' rhymes is my hobby

You're probably, like, what's he on
'Cause I rock it from the start, till the beat is gone
Not in the mafia but I'm the microphone Don
And the words that I shoot out my mouth are Teflon
Jeru never touch ya, microphone wrecka
Meet out in the stretcha
Step up in...my center
Try to match wits but the mentor will crush you
Jeru the Damager, the Suntoucher
