At seventeen
What's gonna happen to him once he finished that scene? 
What's he gonna start doin' when he's bored? 
When he's bored?

I just give damn damn damn
I just give a damn damn damn
I just just give a damn
I just just give a damn
I just just give a damn
I just just give a damn damn damn
I just just give a damn
I just just give a damn
I just just give a damn damn damn

Who sayz all the rules are made with rulers
We break 'em and breakin' them computers
I ain't buying no more from them looters
Who try to out school us
So we jump on our scooters
I hope you understood us 

I just just give a damn
I just just give a damn
I just just give a damn
I just just give a damn damn damn
I just just give a damn damn damn

Hocas pocus
But you can't take away our focus
We growin' up in middle of a digital rukus
You can say f*ck us
I ain't puttin' on the stoppers
We go be hackers
Makin' loot like Lakers
While we become workers
You become golfers
The modern day coppers
Beatin' on us for the papers

I just just give a damn damn damn
I just just give a damn damn damn
