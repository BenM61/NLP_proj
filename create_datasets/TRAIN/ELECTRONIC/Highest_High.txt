Where is my town the place I love
Where I can stay for all time
Don't knock it down or build it up
This is my home for all time

St. Kevin taught me how
John the boxer is braver now
Phil the captain of the cause
Fight you fight for what is yours
What is yours

I can recall one special day
Dressed up in love, only for me
How could I lose, give it away
The highest high you are to me

St. Kevin taught me how
John the boxer is braver now
Phil the captain of the cause
Fight you fight for what is yours
What is yours

Work in my world, put up for sale
You buy you me, I buy me you
Could I return, give something back
Join in the fun, love what I do
