13 above the night
Time to go to a heavy place
We can feel the pulse of time
Naked in the make of lies
That suffocate and blind
We may burn
We will shine
Let's strip away the nausea
And rise above the night
Blow your sweet drug, my man
Psycho-matic, baby
Time to go to a heavy place
And once we're there
We're gonna let our hair down, baby
Bite the vein, feed the line, sit back
And watch the world go crazy
Gotta get out from under the gun
