Big screen real life
Be a part of the story
Get free it's time
Be a candidate
The things that you wanna say
They disappear into fear
And they're gone then
Mystery always hides in your eyes
Mysteries always found in your eyes

Now the moments come
And the story goes on
When you're feeling young
And you just want fun
Get in the picture come on
Now turn the future on us

Get free it's time
To be somebody's story
Be free it's time
Be a candidate
Pictures don't only fade
They reappear into view
If you want them
Visions, they always flashed
In your eyes

And the moments come
Just let the story go on
And the future return
Now you just want fun
Get in the picture belong
And you think so young

Let the feeling come
Get in the story, come on
Now turn the future on us
