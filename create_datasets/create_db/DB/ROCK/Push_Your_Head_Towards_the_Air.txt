If I lay face
Down on the ground
Would you walk all over me?
Have we learned
What we set out to learn?
Well then, love, we will see

Now, don't drown in your tears, babe
Push your head toward the air
Now, don't drown in your tears, babe
I will always be there

When you fall and you
Can't find your way
Push your hand up to the sky
I will run just to
To be by your side
Don't you ever bat an eye

Now, don't drown in your tears, babe
Push your head toward the air
Now, don't drown in your tears, babe
I will always be there

But I will tear the price from your head
And keep you from harm - that's what you said
There's people climbing out of their cars
Lining the roadside, trying to glimpse at the dead

Now, don't drown in your tears, babe
Push your head toward the air
Now, don't drown in your tears, babe
I will always be there
