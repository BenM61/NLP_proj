Taking it easy, taking it slow 
Riding home to lay my body down 
Thought about it long enough 
To let it slip away 

I feel like a stranger today 
Lost in who is across the water 
Took me away from home 
It seems that you gave enough 

To get down on your knees and pray 
I've been waiting for the sun to shine 
To spirit the rain away 
I take sun that fall down on lord 

Calling on the north winds 
When the cloud get in the way 
Nothing ever changes the sun remains the same 
You've got a long way to give 
To sit down on an empty train 

It's been a long time, I'm black and blue 
Taking it easy, living from day to day 
Sometimes it feels so good to finally see life 
Write it in a notebook, you won't repeat it twice 

I'll take the sun before the rain any day 
Call on the north winds when clouds get it the way 
Nothing ever changes the sun remains the same 
Oh I've got a long way to give, I'm sitting on an empty train 

I could make it sound oh so easy 
When you live my life for so long 
I seems it ain't never it ain't never enough 
To set down on your knees and pray 

So tell me how does the train live on... 

I've missed an empty train
