My first name Angelene 
Prettiest mess you've ever seen 
Love for money is my sin 
Any man calls, I'll let him in 
Rose is my color, and white 
Pretty mouth and green my eyes 
I see men come and go 

But there'll be one who will collect my soul and come to me 
Two-thousand miles away 
He walks upon the coast 
Two-thousand miles away 
It lays open like a road 
Dear God, life ain't kind 
People getting born and dying 
But I've heard there's joy untold 
Lays on that open road in front of me 
My first name is Angelene
