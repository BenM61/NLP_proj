I guess the end is near
The reasons now are clear
Still it seems strange somehow to fall in love
Only to find that love is not enough

Like a cigarette in the rain
A single drop would stop the flame
We were lovers, but we were never friends
I should known that it won't end
When the first dawn came
Like a cigarette in the rain

What a cruel twist of fate
To watch our love turn to hate
All of the arguments, the needless fights
Nothing in common, but our sleepless nights

Like a cigarette in the rain
A single drop would stop the flame
We were lovers, but we were never friends
I should known that it won't end
When the first dawn came
Like a cigarette in the rain

Heard the thunder miles away
Didn't think that it work out this way
The storm and it rained all night
Washed away your love before the morning light

Like a cigarette in the rain
A single drop would stop the flame
We were lovers, but we were never, never friends
I should known that it won't end
When the first dawn came
Like a cigarette in the rain

Like a cigarette in the rain
