Through Pioneer 10 and Voyager 1
We've launched our knowledge to other suns
Aspiring and reaching for the highest of beings
We've lost our search for the world's basic needs

The Aliens - inside our machines! The Aliens - inside our dreams!
The Aliens . . . The Aliens, The Aliens are here!

Through fiction and lies we gaze at the skies
For flying saucers and men with three eyes
Creating those monsters we seek to destroy
Like children at play smashing their toys!

The Aliens - controlling our spheres! The Aliens - so far yet so near!
The Aliens . . . The Aliens, The Aliens are here!

All myths of men and gods will apply
When sanity and reason begin to die
The dragons you've denied and wish to slay
May rise to conquer us all someday!
The aliens - the message is clear!
The aliens - the aliens are here
