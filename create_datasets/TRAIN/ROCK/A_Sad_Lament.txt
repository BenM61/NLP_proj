You came exactly on the hour
You know such precision worries me
I like it but in her mower (unknown)
As you watch me from the balcony

Take the stage and take the plunge
Break a leg or a bust a lung
I'll disarm those who carry guns
And neutralize their caustic tongues

The shattered fragments of a star
Shining with a cruel content
We'll make our way to Tommy's Bar
While whistling a sad lament

That's what you are
That's what you are
That's what you are
That's what you are
What you are
