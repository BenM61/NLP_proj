Could you be the most beautiful boy in the world? 
It's plain to see you're the reason that God made a girl 

When the day turns into the last day of all time 
I can say I hope you are in these arms of mine, of mine 
And when the night falls before that day I will cry 
I will cry tears of joy 'cause after you all one can do is die, die 

Could you be the most beautiful boy in the world? 
Could you be? 
It's plain to see you're the reason that God made a girl 

How can I get through days when I can't get through hours? 
I can try but when I do I see you and I'm devoured 
Who'd allow, who'd allow a face to be soft as a flower? 
I can bow and feel proud in the light of this power 

Could you be the most beautiful boy in the world? (Could you be?) 
Could you be? 
It's plain to see you're the reason that God made a girl 

And if the stars ever fell one by one from the sky 
I know Mars could not be to far behind 
'cause baby, this kind of beauty has got no reason to ever be shy 
'cause honey, this kind of beauty is the kind that comes from inside 

Could you be (Could you be?) the most beautiful boy in the world? 
So beautiful, beautiful 
It's plain to see (Plain to see) you're the reason that God made a girl 

Could you be the most beautiful boy in the world? 
you must be beautiful 
It's plain to see you're the reason that God made a girl 
So beautiful 

If the stars ever fell one by one from the sky 
(Could you be the most beautiful boy in the world?) 
I know Mars could not be to far behind 
(It's plain to see you're the reason that God made a girl) 

Could you be the most beautiful boy in the world? (Could you be?) 
So beautiful, beautiful 
It's plain to see you're the reason that God made a girl
