Yeah we are running and how we are running
Across the hills in the pop art blue
Buzzers fly above the car
Circling us as if they knew
If I fall down if I fall down
Darling will you reel me in?
If I lose it if I lose it
Will you remind where we've been?

So we were climbing and how we were climbing
The cartoon trees up to the sky
As the sun drops off the page
Gold it flew into my eye

Well it's all up from here.
It's like I can taste opportunity near.
I cut myself on barbwire, getting wood for the fire
I was too busy staring at you 
You 

So then we were floating up, we were floating like particles into the night
High above the factories
We hitched a lift on a satellite
Lover will you spin me round?
May we never fall back to ground

Well it's all, up from here
It's like I can taste opportunity near
I cut myself on barbwire
Getting wood for the fire
I was too busy staring at you 

Well it's all up from here
It's like I can taste opportunity near
I cut myself on barbwire
Getting wood for the fire
I was too busy staring at you 
I was too busy staring at you (falling into)(getting wood for the fire)
I was too busy staring at you (into your eyes)(getting wood for the fire)
I was too busy staring at you (falling into)(getting wood for the fire)
I was too busy staring at you (into your eyes)(getting wood for the fire)
You (falling in to)
(Into your eyes)

(Into your eyes)
(Getting wood for the fire)
(Getting wood for the fire)
(Falling into)
(Into your eyes)
(Falling into)
(Into your eyes)
