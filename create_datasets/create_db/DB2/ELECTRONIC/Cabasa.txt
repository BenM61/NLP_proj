Thinking back to when I asked Naomi out
Sitting around in a wooden classroom
Planning my line with a friend from Cornwall
Hiding my erection with a book by Morrish
Misread smiles and summer promise

Intervening love between the years
Has made me understand
I'm glad Naomi turned me down

Soon will be the day you take my kingdom out
Panic at dawn on the Northcliffe prospect
You were a western biplane
Dropping bits of speaker on a textured runway
Teeth and death and bower feathers

If you want to book the band
Be sure to hear their album first
Or else you might upset your Shoreditch caterie

I live above a shop
I go downstairs and let the kitten out
She nearly knocks the box
