I gotta think of something to make you think less
Of me, that I am nothing
To hold on to 'cause we are through
I dislike you

I wish that you could hate me
Then things would be so easy, just get me off your mind
If the bitch would have a son
Then I would be the one, so hate me

Geese, flying from the winter
That's what I should do, do, do or become a sprinter
And run away 'cause we are through
I dislike you

I wish that you could hate me
Then things would be so easy, just get me off your mind
If the bitch would have a son
Then I would be the one, I am being mean
Like no one's ever been, just hate me, just hate me

I wish that you could hate me
Then things would be so easy, just get me off your mind
I wish that you could hate me
Then things would be so easy, just get me off your mind
If the bitch would have a son
Then I would be the one, so hate me
