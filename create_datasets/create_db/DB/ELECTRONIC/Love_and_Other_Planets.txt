Come with me
There's something you should see
In the evening sky
Put on your warmest coat

We'll be breathing ghosts
And they don't want us to see
So they join the clouds
Which clot above our heads

But on a clear night
If you look close enough
You can just make out 
Love

And other planets
We are not alone

Normally
It's bright enough to see
With a naked eye
I held you close to me

And I felt you smile
And you whispered in my ear
"I know it's there
Let's make our own light"

And on a clear night
If you look close enough
You can just make out
Love

And other planets
We are not alone
And on this clear night
If I hold you close enough
I can feel love
