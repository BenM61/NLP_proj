Please, tell me the reason
Behind the colors that you fly
Love just one nation
And the whole world, we divide

You won't say, you're sorry
There is no other choice
God bless the people now
Who cannot raise their voice

We can chase down all our enemies
Bring them to their knees
We can bomb the world to pieces
But we can't bomb it into peace

Whoa, we may even find a solution
To hunger and disease
We can bomb the world to pieces
But we can't bomb it into peace

Violence brings one thing
More more of the same
Military madness
The smell of flesh and burning pain

So I sing out to the masses
Stand up if you're still sane
To all of us gone crazy
I sing this one refrain

We can chase down all our enemies
Bring them to their knees
We can bomb the world to pieces
But we can't bomb it into peace

Whoa, we may even find a solution
To hunger and disease
We can bomb the world to pieces
But we can't bomb it into peace

And I sing power to the peaceful
Love to the peaceful why?all
Power to the peaceful
Love to the peaceful why?all

We may even find a solution
To hunger and disease
We can bomb the world to pieces
But we can't bomb it into peace

Say we can chase down all our enemies
We can even bring them to their knees
We can bomb the world into pieces
But we can't bomb it into peace

And I sing power to the peaceful
Love to the peaceful why?all
I sing power to the peaceful
Love to the peaceful why?all
I sing
