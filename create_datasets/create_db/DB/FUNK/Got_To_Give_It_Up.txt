I used to go out to parties and stand around; 
'cause I was too nervous to really get down.
But my body yearned to be free.
I got up on the floor, boy,
so somebody could choose me.
No more standin' upside the wall.
I have got myself together, baby, 
now I'm havin' a ball.
Long as you're groovin' theres' always a chance 
somebody watchin' might wanna make romance.
 
Move your body, move baby, and dance all night,
To the groovin', I feel all right.
Havin' a party, ooh, invite all your friends;
But if you see me stop by, let me in.
Baby, just party all night long.
Let me slip into your erotic zone.
(We heard that!)
 
Move it up, 
Turn it around, ooh, shake it down
Ooh, you can bump me when you want to, babe.
This is such a groovy party, baby.
Dancin' face to face and everybody's screamin' 
this is such a groovy place.
All the young ladies are so fine.
You're movin' your body leaves me no doubt;
know what you're thinkin', baby, you want to turn me out.
Think I'm gonna let you do it?
 
Keep on dancin' oh, Keep on dancin' oh.
Ooh, look so good, yeah, keep on dancin'
Oh, now sugar, got to give it up.
Keep on dancin', gotta give it up.
Keep on dancin' . . . . .
