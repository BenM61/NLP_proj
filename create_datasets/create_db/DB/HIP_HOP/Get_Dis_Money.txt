We dedicate this to these people out here getting bank
Where the oops you loose the money its reali-tay
Never front on a clique that you can't evaluate
See I got things out here I need to situate
I got a fresh ass car on some gloss paint
People walking down the street untill they feet stank
I got accountants out here handling big thangs
As I slip into the crib wit the sashay
Have my room wit the shark wit the big tank
Don't get mad cause I'm doing things you just can't, can't, can't

Hey, hey, hey, h-hey, hey
What you say, get this money
If they say what you gon do today
Just say
Hey, I wanna get paid
'Ery day, 'ery day, 'ery day
'Ery day, 'ery day, 'ery day

My man
You need to get back like the rebate
And bitties he need to step up like the home plate
My man
Now what you know about the Great Lakes
We contemplate on gettin money like a sweepstakes
Sipping dark grapes, party in the dark shade
You see a nigga cold chilling like a Marl-ey Marl
And bitties ride like a Harl-ey
Money make, a Ric, a Ric-o Suav-e, hey
Radio play the S like arcades
Everyday the holiday so nigga stay paid
Celebrate the holidays with the money
Ain't about to wait so nigga stay away

Hey, hey, hey, h-hey, hey
What you say, get this money
If they say what you gon do today
Just say
Hey, I wanna get paid
'Ery day, 'ery day, 'ery day
'Ery day, 'ery day, 'ery day

Somebody said that radio would never ever play
Some of that Detroit, Motor City for play
Honestly earning my dough, keeping it real y'all
Countin my cash, just showing you how the boss ball
I never thought that we would make it up this far
Grippin my cream color Cadillac, North Star
Detroit Motor City finest is who we are
This is for my ladies who get out, chill at the bar
When I was a young boy chilling in my daddys nuts
All I could hear was a rhyme and dope cuts
Growin up thinking I was nothing, but a glut
Another day, another buck, another slut
All I wanna do is get paid
Oak town dont stop, stop, stop

Hey, hey, hey, h-hey, hey

If they say what you gon do today
Just say
Hey, I wanna get paid
'Ery day, 'ery day, 'ery day
Hey, hey, hey, h-hey, hey
What you say, get this money
If they say what you gon do today
Just say
