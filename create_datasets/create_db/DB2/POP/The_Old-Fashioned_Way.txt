Dance in the old fashioned way
Won't you stay in my arms?
Just melt against my skin
And let me feel your heart
Don't let the music win
By dancing far apart
Come close where you belong
Let's hear our secret song

Dance in the old fashioned way
Won't you stay in my arms?
And we'll discover highs
We never knew before
If we just close our eyes
And dance around the floor
That gay old fashioned way
That makes me love you more

Come closer
Forget about the others
It's nice to be like this, cheek to cheek
In the old fashioned way
Hahaha, it's funny, but
I have the feeling that we dancing as our parents used to do
Well, maybe they weren't wrong
The world changes, love stays

Dance in the old fashioned way
Won't you stay in my arms?
And we'll discover highs
We never knew before
If we just close our eyes
And dance around the floor
That gay old fashioned way
That makes me love you more
