King of the nations
The Living Word, the one who broke the curse
All of creation is awaiting His return

The Mighty Warrior who defeated sin
To save the souls of man
Like rolling thunder He is coming back again
Holding victory in His hand

Hallelujah, Hallelujah to the Lamb
Glory, glory, glory to the great I Am
Every tongue and nation
Will confess that He is Lord

The armies of Heaven
Follow like a flood behind the rising Son
He brings redemption
His robe is dipped in blood

The forces of evil
And all His enemies will crumble at His feet
The Son of God and Son of Man
Before His power, who can stand?

Hallelujah, Hallelujah to the Lamb
Glory, glory, glory to the great I Am
Holy, holy, we will bow before His throne
Every tongue and nation
Will confess that He is Lord

Holy, glory, power, praise
Holy, glory, power, praise

Hallelujah, Hallelujah to the Lamb
Glory, glory, glory to the great I Am
Holy, holy, we will bow before His throne
Every tongue and nation
Will confess that He is Lord

Glory, glory, glory to the great I Am
Holy, holy, we will bow before His throne
Every tongue and nation
Will confess that He is Lord
