Then I come in, they go mad, 
Hit my nose and hit my back, 
Break me every single bone, 
Throw me out just like a stone. 
It's the corner. it's the dress, 
Small the town and big the mess, 
That I cause with every step, 
But still I walk, nonetheless. 

They're skipping backwards, 
They're thrashing days, 
Is that all they're believing in? 
Smash my head to make it spin. 

It won't change so come with me, 
Just with your eyes I will see. 
Just with your arms I can hold, 
And keep away them dump and cold.
