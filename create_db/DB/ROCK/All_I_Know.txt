This is my sense of reality
This is proof of my coming of age
This is truth in captivity
This is loosing a theology, I
I'm a soul taker
I'm a cruel, witted mind
This is my sense of reality
This is proof of my coming of age
I'm a soul taker
I'm a cruel witted mind

Are you with me?
Are you of my mind?
Are you with me?
Are you of my mind?

Waking, falling, free of gravity
We just severed these umbilical wires
This is more than just affinity
We're moving further through an endless desire
I'm a soul taker
I'm a cruel witted mind

Come again, I feel a breakdown
Let's go higher

This is the sound of your
Reason to wake
Have we forgotten now?
Can we relate?

It's backwards, it makes no sense
So real that we can't pretend
It's backwards, it makes no sense
It's harder to just pretend

Say it once more
Say it again
That this is the end
Of all I know

Say it once more
Say it again
That this is the end
Of all I know

Are you with me?
(Can we relate?)
Are you of my mind?
Are you with me?
(Can we relate?)
Are you off my mind?

Say it once more
Say it again
That this is the end
Of all I know

Say it once more
Say it again
That this is the end
Of all I know
