Straight off tha streets of muthafuckin compton
It's the downest nigga I know
Eazy muthafuckin me
Bout to kick your ass in ninety-three

I creep and I crawl and I creep and I crawl 
And I creep and I crawl creep creep
I said I creep and I crawl and I creep and I crawl
And I creep and I crawl creep creep

I got my niggas from gravestreet watts
I got my niggas from the cpt
I got my niggas all across the motherfuckin land 
That's down with the e-a-z-why  e
Now, early in the mornin I awake 
Thinkin about these dead fool's life that I had to take
Frontin on a true name I peep game at point blank range
F*ck 'em
(muthafuckin right ya'll)
Back to the set as I jet
Not givin a f*ck about the nigga that I went
That's what he gotta shout for actin like a trick
Now he's 6 feet and I'm deep in his bitch
Creepin creepin creepin on the marks that be sleepin
Catch you slippin slap the clip in buck 'em every weekend
A scandalous lil' nigga with the heart to feel remorse
Dick the niggas corps leave it on his momma's porch
Don't give a f*ck about shit that's why I mellow
Or maybe it's the fact that I'm kin to the devil
A psychopathic nigga that's always quick to fill a
Nigga for a cause I'm a muthafuckin killer
Thriller from manilla though I'm shown as the average
Try to test your luck and get bucked by a muthafuckin savage

I got my niggas from gravestreet watts
I got my niggas from the cpt
I got my niggas all across the muthafuckin land
That's down with the e-a-z-why  e
Now, later on that night as I'm rollin
Lookin for a nigga I can gat and pack a hole in
Stoppin at a light on the latenight
Fire up a phillie blunt to get my head right
See some niggas slippin at a burger stand
And in my mind all I'm thinkin is a murder plan
Creepin through the drive through kinda slow
I got my hot beams on the back of the .4
Yo , smokin on chronic with the rag down
Not knowin I'm about to lay their ass down
Reach for them fools make my move
Leaned out my jeep and I creep kinda smooth
With the gat to the nigga's dome now he's sleeps
One shot to the top body flopped on the seat
Peep , I dumped on the lil' skinny passenger 
A bitch is screamin in a rage so I blasted her
Smashed and I got about 5 blocks
Before I got stopped by punk ass cops
(Shit, f*ck 'em)

F*ck you
