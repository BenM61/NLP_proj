Damn I never thought I'd say what I'm about to say 
Didn't want anyone 
but I met you and the whole thing changed
All the things you said had me hoping that your game was true 
Got to comfortable didn't see the real side of you
And now its obvious
even with your best
this ain't gonna work no more
What was I waitin' for

[Chorus]
I'm so done and there's nothing you can do 
I'm better off with out you 
There will be no second chances 
Taking you back 
'Cause I'm over that 
So done 
Nothing you say can change my mind 
Don't even waste your time 
Truth is you took me for granted and I really had it 
I'm so done

Now don't come around 
with promises that don't exist 
'Cause heard it all before and your sorry's 
Ain't fixin' this, no
Held on for so long 
'Cause I didn't wanna let you go
Thinking you really cared 
and that time would let it show
And now its obvious
even with your best
this ain't gonna work no more
What was I waitin' for

[Chorus]

Maybe I was stupid thinking you could handle this 
I was dead wrong counting on you for my happiness 
I hate to realize I didn't see it up to now 
I been a fool not leavin' you but now I'm breakin' out 
So ima keep on pressin' on 
I'm so done

[Chorus: x2]
