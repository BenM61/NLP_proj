Mr Magoo, you may be blind, but I can still see you!
Anytime you see, that might come true, right type of mood!
Once again the rude boy, just launch an attack, because,
Crowd a people, dem no want no less than that.

Each and every time we bust the boom shack attack, because,
Rough and ready, justa de pun track.
Are you ready? Are you ready, Lord? Are you ready? Are you ready?

I'm in the right type of mood, right type of mood,
I'm in the right type of mood, right type of mood.
I'm in the right type of mood, right type of mood,
I'm in the right type of mood, right type of mood.

Me like a fish outta water, same time that the lyrics, come out me head, because,
Papa Herbie, just respect natty dread,
Check out that bad boy, bust de boom shack attack, because,
Once again we defy, put you on ya back.
Are you ready? Are you ready, Lord? Are you ready? Are you ready?

Mr Magoo, I'm still with you!
Right type of mood, right type of mood,
Right type of mood, right type of mood. Watch this!

Mary had a little lamb, but then she let it go, because,
Down in the city, Papa Herbie had a show.
Jack and Jill went up the hill, and both dem fell down, because,
Me not gonna tell no answer.

But they was ready, are you ready? But they was ready,
So are your ready, Lord? They was ready, are you ready?
Me like a fish outta water, same time that the lyrics, some out me head, because,
Right type of mood.

Me like a fish outta water, 
Same time that the lyrics come out me head, 
Because, follow me.

Mr Magoo, I'm still with you!
Right type of mood, right type of mood,
Right type of mood, right type of mood. Watch this!

Mr Magoo, you may be blind, but I can still see you!
