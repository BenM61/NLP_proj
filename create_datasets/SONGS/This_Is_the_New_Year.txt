Another year you made a promise
Another chance to turn it all around
And do not save this for tomorrow
Embrace the past and you can live for now
And I will give the world to you

Speak louder that the words before you
And give them meaning no one else has found
The role we play is so important
We are the voices of the underground
And I would give the world to you

Say everything you've always wanted,
Be not afraid of who you really are,
Cause in the end we have each other,
And that's at least one thing worth living for,
And I would give the world to you

A million suns that shine upon me
A million eyes you are the brightest blue
Lets tear the walls down that divide us
And build a statue strong enough for two,

I pass it back to you
And I will wait for you,
Cause I would give the world
And I would give the world
And I would give the world to you

This is the new year
A new beginning
You made a promise
You are the brightest
We are the voices
This is the new year
We are the voices
This is the new year
