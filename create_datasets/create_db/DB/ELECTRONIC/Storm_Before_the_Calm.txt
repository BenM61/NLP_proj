Lift up your heads
To see an azure canvas splattered red
The tempest's eye has filled the sky
But if you believe

Zero hour is just a new day's eve
You have been warned
It's just the storm before the calm

All in the name of liberty
In the end it shall deliver you
Deliver me from evil arms
It's just the storm before the calm

Lift up your hearts
We are subjects in life imitating art
The time has come, we wait as one
And if we believe

We can weather all upheavals in unity
It's just the storm
One last storm before the calm

All in the name of liberty
In the end it shall deliver you
Deliver me from evil arms
It's just the storm before the calm 

Oh-oh oh oh

All in the name of liberty
In the end it shall deliver you
Deliver me from evil arms
It's just the storm before the calm 

All in the name of liberty
In the end it shall deliver you
Deliver me from evil arms
It's just the storm before the calm
