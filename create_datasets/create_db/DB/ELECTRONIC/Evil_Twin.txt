Looking like a Hitchcock scene
I've been sleeping under trampolines
If I get a chance
Guess I'll blame it on the other me
If he's keen

I know
You're right

'Cause you're the only one that understands
When I'm hopeless
And you're the only one to give a damn
That I'm broken
And now I'm drowning in the quicksand
You've got me by the toes and
I always knew you had the upper hand (upper hand)

Messages I sent to her
Said she couldn't understand a word
Climbing out the window
Wondering what it is I heard
So absurd

I know
You're right

'Cause you're the only one that understands
When I'm hopeless
And you're the only one to give a damn
That I'm broken
And now I'm drowning in the quicksand
You've got me by the toes and
I always knew you had the upper hand (upper hand)

I know
You're right
I know
You're right

'Cause you're the only one that understands
When I'm hopeless
And you're the only one to give a damn
That I'm broken
And now I'm drowning in the quicksand
You've got me by the toes and
I always knew you had the upper hand (upper hand)
