Ding dong, ding dong,
Slumber time,
The moon descends
And so to bed.
The music ends
And go to bed.

Should auld acquaintance linger in your heart,
Then don't forget we're just a dream apart!
Tomorrow night seems years away,
But after all it's just a day!
And I'll remember every word you said,
I love you so, and so to bed,

And so to bed!
