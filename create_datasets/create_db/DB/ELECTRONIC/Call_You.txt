I can't change the way things are
Even though it feels wrong in my heart
Even though it kills me to breathe this air
See life does what it thinks is fair

When I'm driving through the night
With no strength left inside
Can I call you? Can I call you?
When the radio don't play
The song to ease my pain
Can I call you? (Can I call you?)
Can I call you? (Can I call you?)

Can I call you? Can I call you?
Can I call you? Can I call you?
Can I call you? Can I call you?
Can I call you? Can I call you?

See, I can't change the way things are
Even though it feels wrong in my heart

When I'm driving through the night
With no strength left inside
Can I call you? Can I call you?
When the radio don't play
The song to ease my pain
Can I call you? (Can I call you?)
Can I call you? (Can I call you?)

Can I call you? Can I call you?
Can I call you? Can I call you?

Maybe the stars will show me something
Something I can hold on to
And maybe the stars will show me something
Shine a light so I know it's you

Can I call you? Can I call you?
Can I call you? Can I call you?

Maybe the stars will show me something
Something I can hold on to
And maybe the stars will show me something
Shine a light so I know it's you
Can I call you? Can I call you?
Can I call you? Can I call you?
