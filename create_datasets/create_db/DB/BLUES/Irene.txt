Irene, good night, Irene, good night
Good night, Irene, good night, Irene
I'll get you in my dreams

Sometimes I live in the country
Sometimes I live in town
Sometimes I have a great notion
To jump in to the river and drown

Irene, good night, Irene, good night
Good night, Irene, good night, Irene
I'll get you in my dreams

Stop rambling and stop gambling
Quit staying out late at night
Go home to your wife and your family
Sit down by a fireside bright

Irene, good night, Irene, good night
Good night, Irene, good night, Irene
