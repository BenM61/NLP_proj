Well when I was a young boy, I used to slip away
Down to the ashgrove to hear the old blues men play
There was big Joe and lightnin' and reverend Gary too
Well I'd sit and stare and dream of doin' what they could do

Well it's been thirty years since the ashgrove burned down
And I'm out on this highway travelin' town to town
Tryin' to make a livin', tryin' to pay the rent
Tryin' to figure out where my life went

I wanna go back to the ashgrove
That's where I come from
I wanna go back to the ashgrove
That's where I belong

Well you don't have to go searchin', pretend to put on airs
'Cause the blues are gonna find you someday, somewhere
Now my mother's gone, now my fathers gone
And all the old blues men have all passed on

And I'm out on this highway travelin' town to town
Settin' up my gear and then I'm tearin' it down
Turnin' up my guitar, standin' up on the stage
I'm just tryin' to raise the ghosts up out of their graves

I wanna go back to the ashgrove
That's where I come from
Yeah I wanna go back to the ashgrove
That's where I belong

Well I can't say I been all sinner, can't say I been all saint
I've done some good deeds and I've made big mistakes
I've been in and out of love, said words I regret
I've been drunk, been sober smoked too many cigarettes

And I'm out on this highway travelin' town to town
And the news on the radio just brings me down
Intolerance and fear, ignorance and lies
It's the same old same old I heard a million times

And I'm thinkin' of friends and lovers and how they come and go
Like look-alike houses on the side of the road
Full of everyday people tryin' to get ahead
Tryin' to find a reason just to get out of bed

'Cause we all need somethin' just to get us through
Well I'm gonna play the blues tonight man
'Cause that's what I do

I'm goin' back to the ashgrove
That's where I come from
I'm goin' back to the ashgrove
That's where I belong
