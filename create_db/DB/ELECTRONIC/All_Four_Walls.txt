As the minutes turn to hours
With the fading of the daylight
And a heartbeat full of colour
Is turning into black and white
It's like every day
These four walls are closing in
On all you had and all you want
And all you love

But now all four walls are falling down
All four walls (all four walls)
Yeah, all four walls are falling down
All four walls (all four walls)

(All four walls)
(All four walls)

As the days all pull together
In an island of fluorescent lights
All the ghosts I see before me
Lead me on into the burning night
And in every way
These four walls are closing in
On all you had and all you want
And all you love

But now all four walls are falling down
All four walls (all four walls)
Yeah, all four walls are falling down
All four walls (all four walls)

All you have, all you hold
All you love (all four walls)
All you have, all you hold
All you hold, all you love (all four walls)
All you have, all you hold
All you love
All you have, all you hold
All you hold, all you love

But now all four walls are falling down
All four walls (all four walls)
Yeah, all four walls are falling down
All four walls (all four walls)
All four walls are falling down
All four walls (all four walls)
Yeah, all four walls are falling down
All four walls (all four walls)
