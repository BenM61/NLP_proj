Run run runnin' we're the victims of the 
Night 
Just like a moving target in a street fight 
Break down these barricades let the gates 
Begin to fall 
Gotta stop take a look live every moment 
Or lose it all 

Forever 
Shine on, shine on 
No border will come between us 
Forever 
We are strong together 

On wings of freedom let the change 
Begin to inspire 
We are the new survivours in the crossfire 
Don't need arrogance in the streets and 
In the sky 
Stop take a look ceal with the moment 
Or live a lie 

Forever 
Shine on, shine on 
No border will come between us 
Forever 
We are strong together 

Ah can't you see we're getting strong 
Shine on forever 

(solo) 

Stop take a look ceal with the moment 
Or live a lie 

Forever 
Shine on, shine on 
No border will come between us 
Forever 
We are strong together 

Forever 
Shine on, shine on 
No border will come between us 
Forever 
We are strong together 

Shine on, shine on, shine on
