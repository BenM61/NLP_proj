Mama, come here quick,
Bring me that lickin' stick.
Mama, come here quick,
Bring me that lickin' stick.

Mama, come here quick,
Bring me that lickin' stick.
Mama, come here quick,
Bring me that lickin' stick.

People standin',
Standin' in a trance.
Sister out in the backyard
Doin' the outside dance.

Come'n tell me you love me,
She didn't wanna be a drag.
I don't know what she's doin',
I think she's got a brand new bag.
