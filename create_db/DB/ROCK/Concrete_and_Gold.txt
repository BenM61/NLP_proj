You lost your mind
I could not go
What little time we spent
A penny on the floor

My desperation
A spinning top
Revolving on and on
A world that never stops

Is it all mine?
How could I know?
We threw the rind away
Swallowed all the core

Tried levitation
You're not alone
The stars are holding open
A door we'll never close

I have an engine made of gold
Something so beautiful
The world will never know
Our roots are stronger than you know
Up through the concrete we will grow

Is it all mine?
I can't let go
What little time we spent
A penny on the floor
My desparation
Is this a curse?
'Til death do us part
For better or for worse

I have an engine made of gold
Something so beautiful
The world will never know

Our roots are stronger than you know
Up through the concrete we will grow
Our roots are stronger than you know
Up through the concrete we will grow
