I'm not talking anymore
All the skins of the words fell off in my hands
If I told you & showed you you'd laugh

I'm not trying anymore
All my good intentions fell out of my hands
If I told you & showed you you'd laugh

You're always right when I'm lonely
I can fake it so long only
Lose track of days whiling away
I don't have strength to get away
Lose track of days whiling away
I don't have strength to get away

I thought it would be so easy
That I didn't need to worry
I'm safe inside your hands
Why'd I listen why'd I fall for that

You're always right when I'm lonely
I can fake it so long only
You're always right when I'm lonely
I can take it so long only

I'm not talking anymore
All the skins of the words fell off in my hands
If I told you & showed you you'd laugh

I'll stay all night when I'm lonely
I can fake it so long only
You're always right when I'm lonely
I can take it so long only

Lose track of days whiling away
I don't have strength to get away

Lose track of days whiling away
I don't have strength to get away
