If I had to do it over, If I had to do it again
I would've known, too and this would have neva began
If I made you claustrophobic, Betcha if I gave u an inch
You'll never know this but there's no one quite like, no one quite like you

I try to forget ya but you're all I wanna do
I can do better but there's no one quite like you

I try to forget ya but you're all I wanna do
I can do better but there's no one quite like you

If I made you love me again (If I made you love me again)
If I made you want it again (If I made you want it again)
If I gave it you probably wouldn't want it, babe
It's alright cause there's no one quite like you

I try to forget ya but you're all I wanna do
I can do better but there's no one quite like you

I try to forget ya but you're all I wanna do
I can do better but there's no one quite like you

I try to forget ya but you're all I wanna do
I can do better but there's no one quite like you
