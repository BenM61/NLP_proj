My name is Vernon James and I live to the south of town
I work my window watching the women go round and round
Some people come here for love
Some people come for fantasy
When two in the morning comes around
My baby comes around for me

Someone come, come my someone
Take the clouds from my eyes, the one
I know that sometime soon
One day, we'll walk in the sun

I'm taking tickets and watching the men always looking down
Sometimes I feel like an animal in the zoo staring out
No one looks me in the eye
They save it for the girls inside
I don't care much what they see
I know she saves it all for me

Someone come, come my someone
Take the clouds form my eyes, my one
I know that sometime soon
One day we'll walk in the sun

Some people come here for love
Some come for curiosity
I know there will be a day
I know we'll figure out a way

Someone come, come my someone
Take the clouds from my eyes, my one
I know that sometime soon
One day we'll walk in the sun
