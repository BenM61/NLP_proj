Feel it
Feel it
Feel it
Feel it

Baby when the band is playin'
And that solid beat
Make you wanna move, make you wanna groove
Make you wanna pat your feet
Don't fight it, don't fight it, feel it

Oh now, when we dance close together
With your cheek close to mine
And you begin to feel a funny little thrill
Moving up your spine
Don't fight it, don't fight it, feel it

Oh now, baby when the swingin' music
Make you wanna flip
Don't be in pain tryin' to restrain
Go ahead and move your hips

Oh baby when you're dancin' near me
And I feel I wanna tease
Oh and when I do, the feeling gets you
And you feel you wanna squeeze
Don't fight it, don't fight it, just feel it
Feel it
Feel it
Feel it
Feel it
Feel it
Feel it

Oh now, baby when the swingin' music
Make you wanna flip
Don't be in pain tryin' to restrain
Go ahead, shake them hips

Oh baby when you're dancin' near me
And I feel I wanna tease
And when I do, the feeling gets you
And you feel you wanna squeeze
Don't fight it, don't fight it, just feel it
Feel it
Feel it
Feel it
Feel it
Feel it
Feel it
