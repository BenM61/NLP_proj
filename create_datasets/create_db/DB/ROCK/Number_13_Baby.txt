Got hair in a girl, that flows to her bones
And a comb in her pocket, if the winds get blown
Stripes on her eyes when she walks slow
But her face falls down, when she go, go, go
Black tear falling on my lazy queen
Gotta tattooed tit say number 13

Viva, don't want no blue eyes
La loma, I want brown eyes
Rica, I'm in a state, I'm in a state
I'm in a state, I'm in a state 
I'm in a state, I'm in

Choir in the yard, in the house next door
Where a grandma brought, some songs from the shore
Six foot girl gonna, sweat when she dig
Stand close to the fire, when they light the pig
Standing in her chinos shirt pulled off clean
Gotta tattooed tit say number 13

Viva, don't want no blue eyes
La loma, I want brown eyes
Rica, I'm in a state, I'm in a state
I'm in a state, I'm in a state, I'm in a state

Viva, don't want no blue eyes
La loma, I want brown eyes
Rica, I'm in a state
