If all I was was black
Looking at you, you might look past

All the love I give (got love to give)
I've got natural gifts (got natural gifts)
Got perspective (got perspective)
Might make your shift (the way you look at it)

I've got love
Got love

If all I did was cry
If all that feeling got left behind

I'd worry about you (what's in your mind)
I'd never live my life (be wasting my time)
Oh, I won't be afraid (I won't be afraid)
If that's how you wanna stay (how you wanna stay)

I've got the love
Got love

If all I was was black
Don't you wanna know me more than that?

All the love I give (got love to give)
Got natural gifts (got natural gifts)
I've got perspective (got perspective)
Might make your shift (the way you look at it)

I've got the love, love
Got love

And it's time for more to love, mmm
Oh, it's time, it's time, for more love

All the love I give (got love to give)
I've got natural gifts (got natural gifts)
I've got perspective (got perspective)
Just might make your shift (the way you look at it)

I've got love, love
I've got love
And it's time for more to love
