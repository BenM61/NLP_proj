The naughty lady of shady lane had hit the town like a bomb
The back fence gossips ain't been this good since Mabel ran off with Tom
Our town was peaceful and quite before she came on the scene
The lady has started a riot disturbing the suburban routine
Oh the naughty lady of shady lane has the town in a whirl
The naughty lady of shady lane me oh my oh what a girl

You should see how see carries on with her admirers galore
She must be giving them quite a thrill the way they flock to her door
She throws those come-hither glances at every Tom, Dick and Joe
When offered some liquid refreshment the lady never never says no
Oh the naughty lady of shady lane has the town in a whirl
The naughty lady of shady lane me oh my oh what a girl

The things they're trying to pin on her won't hold much water I'm sure
Beneath the powder and fancy lace there beats a heart sweet and pure
She just needs someone to change her then she'll be nice as can be
If you're in the neighborhood stranger you're welcome to drop in and see
The naughty lady of shady lane so delightful to hold
The naughty lady of shady lane she's delectable quite respectable
And she's only nine days old
