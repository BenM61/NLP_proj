Trouble don't you find no home by me
Trouble don't you find no home by me
Oh my Lord, if you're listening
Tell them, go ahead and get gone

Trouble don't you find no home by me
Trouble don't you find no home by me
Oh my Lord, if you're listening
Tell them, go ahead and get gone

I've tried living life right
Don't know if I want to do it anymore, no
Because I've lived a pretty good life
But trouble keeps on knocking at my front door

Well, this time I want to be done
I want to be, yes, I want to be done
Because I could be a warrior, be a hero, be a saint
But trouble keeps on blocking my way

Trouble don't you find no home by me
Trouble don't you find no home by me
Oh my Lord, if you're listening
Tell them, go ahead and get gone

I ain't scared of you no more

I'm done, saying things nice
Now you better back up off of me
Because you're on super thin ice
And when it breaks things I'm going to get ugly

Because I'm done, I promise I'm done
I want to be, yes, I want to be done
Because I could be a warrior, be a hero, be a saint
But trouble keeps on blocking my way

Trouble don't you find no home by me
Trouble don't you find no home by me
Oh my Lord, if you're listening
Tell them, go ahead and get gone

I'm begging you to move
Because if you get the best
Oh, that would be a tragedy
So, please just move

Trouble don't you find no home by me
Trouble don't you find no home by me
Oh my Lord, if you're listening
Tell them, go ahead and get gone

Trouble don't you find no home by me
Trouble don't you find no home by me
Oh my Lord, if you're listening
Tell them, go ahead and get gone

You're going to move on, trouble
Because you are in trouble
I ain't scared of you, no
I ain't running no more
You better move on, trouble
You better move on, trouble
Get gone
