Let me tell you a story about a boll weevil
Now, some of you may not know
But a boll weevil is an insect
And he's found mostly where cotton grows
Now, where they comes from, hm, nobody really knows
But this is the way the story goes

The farmer said to the boll weevil
"I see you're on the square"
Boll weevil said to the farmer
"Say yep, my whole darn family's here
We gotta have a home, gotta have a home"

The farmer said to the boll weevil
"Say, why do you pick my farm"
The weevil just laughed at the farmer 'n' said
"We ain't gonna do you much harm"
We're lookin' for a ho-o-o-o-o,-o-o-o, -o-o-o, o-o-ome"

And the boll weevil spotted a lightning bug
He said "Hey, I'd like to make a trade with you
'Cause you see if I was a lightning bug
I'd search the whole night through
Searchin' for a home, I'd have me plenty of home"

And the boll weevil called the farmer, 'n' he said
"You better sell your old machines
'Cause when I'm through with your cotton
Heh, you can't even buy gasoline
I'm gonna take me a home, gotta have a home"

And the boll weevil said to the farmer,
Says "Farmer, I'd like to wish you well"
Farmer said to the boll weevil
"Yeah, an' I wish that you were in
Lookin' for a home
Lookin' for a home
Ah you'd have a home alright, you'd a home
A real hot home"
