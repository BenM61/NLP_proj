I wanna take you somewhere
You have never been
I wanna show you something
You have never seen
I can feel the pressure
Just fading away
I know oh yes I know
It's a brand new day mm.

Oh yeah, love sweet sound
(just a love, a love sweet sound)
Oh yeah, love sweet sound
(just a love, a love sweet sound)

Early in the morning
I can hear you say
I don't know where I'm going
But I know I know its the way
I can feel it deep,
Deep down within
I haven't felt this good oh
Since I don't, I don't know when

Just a love, a love sweet sound.
Oh yeah, love sweet sound
(just a love, a love sweet sound)
Oh yeah, love sweet sound
(just a love, a love sweet sound)

Oh yeah, ooh

Just a love, a love sweet sound.
Just a love, a love sweet sound.
Oh yeah, love sweet sound
(just a love, a love sweet sound)
Oh yeah, love sweet sound
(just a love, a love sweet sound)
Just a love, a love sweet sound.
Just a love, a love sweet sound.
Oh yeah, love sweet sound
(just a love, a love sweet sound)
Oh yeah, love sweet sound
(just a love, a love sweet sound)
