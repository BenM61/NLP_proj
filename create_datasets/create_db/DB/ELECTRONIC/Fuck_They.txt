I don't give a f*ck about they
I don't give a f*ck about they

Oh, they put me up, pin me down, tire me slowly
After that, after they, nothing is holy
Play the freak, pray for weeks, smooth out my body
'Cause after all

Deep down in the world, on this rock, we got
All these rules that everyone keep making up
Who the f*ck is they? I wanna meet with them
I wanna be real nice, I wanna be their friend
We gonna get real close, we gonna laugh all night
We gonna have a moment then we say goodbye

I don't give a f*ck about they

I don't give a f*ck about they (Who's they?)
Who gives a f*ck about they? (Who's they?)
I don't give a f*ck (They don't even give a f*ck)
They don't even give a f*ck (Who's they anyway?)
I don't give a f*ck about they (Who's they?)
Who gives a f*ck about they? (Who's they?)
I don't give a f*ck (They don't even give a f*ck)
They don't give a f*ck

Oh my, what a time, what a vibe and we are hardly
Hardly beginning, oh, this party
We got us, we got they, we got an army
Oh, 'cause we know

Deep down in the world, on this rock, we got
All these rules that everyone keep making up
Who the f*ck is they? I wanna meet with them
I wanna be real nice, I wanna be their friend
We gonna get real close, we gonna laugh all night
We gonna have a moment then we say goodbye

I don't give a f*ck about they

I don't give a f*ck about they (Who's they?)
Who gives a f*ck about they? (Who's they?)
I don't give a f*ck (They don't even give a f*ck)
They don't even give a f*ck (Who's they anyway?)
I don't give a f*ck about they (Who's they?)
Who gives a f*ck about they? (Who's they?)
I don't give a f*ck (They don't even give a f*ck)
They don't give a f*ck

I don't give a f*ck about they (Who's they?)
Who gives a f*ck about they? (Who's they?)
I don't give a f*ck (They don't even give a f*ck)
They don't even give a f*ck (Who's they anyway?)
I don't give a f*ck about they (Who's they?)
Who gives a f*ck about they? (Who's they?)
I don't give a f*ck (They don't even give a f*ck)
They don't give a f*ck

I don't give a f*ck about they
