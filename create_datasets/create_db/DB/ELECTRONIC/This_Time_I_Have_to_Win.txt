Don't really feel so good
My life is at an end.
Fame is so hard to get
So many lows and downs.

You know I'm not so bad and
I can write a song
If they only let me show
What I can do.

No way to find a job
My car's without a part.
Millions of bills to pay
My landlord wants me out.

Whatever happens
You know I will survive,
This is not the first time
Been down this road before.

This time I have to win on my own.
This time I have to win can't be wrong.

If only just for you
It's important to me.
This time I have to win
Yeah, this time I have to win.

My girl has gone away
I'm left here all alone.
She said if you make it
You know my telephone.
My room is empty besides
Pictures on the walls
But I fell that someday
She'll be knocking at my door.

This time I have to win on my own
This time I have to win can't be wrong.
If only just for you, I'll make it.
This time I have to win on my own
This time I have to win.
