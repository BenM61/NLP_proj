What really went on there?
we only have this excerpt:

There's a party going on down around here
Cruiser's Creek yeah
Watch the shirt-tails flapping in the wind
Sidewalk running
See the people holding from the back
Hat-boaters tilting
There's a party going down around here
Cruiser's Creek now

uh Cruiser's Creek yea
uh Cruiser's Creek yea
uh Cruiser's Creek yea

Got nice pink bubbles in my mouth
From what I've taken
There's a party come around annual
Cruiser's Creek now
And Bianco on the breath guaranteed
Cruiser's Creek yeah
Cruiser's Creek now

Cruiser's Creek yeah
Cruiser's Creek yeah
Cruiser's Creek yeah

See the street-litter twisting in the wind
Crisp bags turning
See B&H cartons laughing in the wind
Road-litter turning
Spent forty-five minutes last night
Parallel crease, pow!
There's a good mid-afternoon breeze
In the air now
Welcome treats from party
My brain is clear now
No more Red Wedge in the pub or ZTT stuff
At Cruiser's Creek now
Cruiser's Creek yeah

Cruiser's Creek
There's a party going down around here
Next to Freedom street
Get the last of the poison off my chest
Cruiser's creek

I crave sex behind steel cabinets
It's for what I'm yearning
And there's a dim chance it's what I'm gonna get
At Cruiser's Creek yeah
At Cruiser's Creek now
At Cruiser's Creek

Workforce! Limited!
Cruiser's Creek yeah!

Somebody went and left on the gas
Checkpoint, main gate
As I lit a number 6 cigarette
Like a wick, burning
Cruiser's Creek.

Stamp it out just before it's too late
Turn the tap off.
My name is Big Hero, mate
Cruiser's Creek
Avoid disaster 
And I imagine
The sound of its blast, yeah.

There's a party going down around here
Cruiser's Creek now

Watch the shirt-tails flapping in the wind
sidewalk running
See the people holding from the back
Hat-boaters tilting
There's a party going on around here
