Call it all for nothing
But I'd rather be nothing to you
Than be a part of something
Of something that I didn't do

(Do you really want to?)
I can be the only one
(Did he even notice?)
I can be the best to you, be the best to you
(Do you really want to?)
I can be the only one
(Did he even notice?)
I can be the best to you, be the best to you

Part of me is faking
Faking it all just for fun
Part of me is breaking
Breaking apart when you come

(Do you really want to?)
I can be the only one
(Did he even notice?)
I can be the best to you be the best to you
(Do you really want to?)
I can be the only one
(Did he even notice?)
I can be the best to you, be the best to you

I feel my bones, I feel my bones, I feel my bones crack in your arms
And I can tell you what you want but I tell you all the things I like
And if I keep myself away would you chase in the dead of night
And I can't be the girl you want but I can be the thing you
Throw away, throw away, throw away
Throw away, throw away, you throw away
Throw away, throw away, throw away
Throw away, throw away, you throw away

(Do you really want to?)
I can be the only one
(Did he even notice?)
I can be the best to you be the best to you
(Do you really want to?)
I can be the only one
(Did he even notice?)
I can be the best to you be the best to you
