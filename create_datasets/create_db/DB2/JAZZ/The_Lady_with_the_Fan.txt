She's the lady with the fan,
When she comes by, hold your man,
She made Smoky Joe so ginny
He forgot about his Minnie.
She's the lady with the fan!

She's the lady with the fan,
Can she dance? Yeah, man!
Every wiggle gets a giggle
From the hick who pays a nickel.
To see the lady with the fan!

She's the lady with the fan,
She's the lady with the fan,
She's such a grand attraction,
She put lazy-bones in action,
She's the lady with the fan!

She's the lady with the fan,
She's the lady with the fan,
In fair or stormy weather,
She shakes them both together,
She's the lady with the fan!
