I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol
Doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you

Some get a kick from cocaine
I'm sure that if
I took even one sniff
It would bore me terrifically too
Yet I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see you
Standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see
You obviously don't adore me

Some get a kick in a plane
Flying too high
With some gal in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do
But I get a kick out of you
I get a kickout of you
