A hand in my mouth 
A life spills into the flowers 
We all look so perfect 
As we all fall down 
In an electric glare 
The old man cracks with age 
She found his last picture 
In the ashes of the fire 
An image of the queen 
Echoes round the sweating bed 
Sour yellow sounds inside my head 

In books 
And films 
And in life 
And in heaven 
The sound of slaughter 
As your body turns 
But it's too late 
But it's too late 
One more day like today and I'll kill you 
A desire for flesh 

And real blood 
I'll watch you drown in the shower 
Pushing my life through your open eyes 
I must fight this sickness 
Find a cure 
I must fight this sickness
