Don't want to boast but I know she's the toast of
(Kalamazoo, zoo, zoo, zoo, zoo, zoo)

Years have gone by

Am I dreamin', I can hear her screamin'
("Hiya, Mr. Jackson")
(Everything's O K A L A M A Z O)
(Oh, what a gal, a real pipperoo

I'll make my bid for that freckle-faced kid I'm hurryin' to
