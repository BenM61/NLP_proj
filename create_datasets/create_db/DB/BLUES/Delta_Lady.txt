Woman of the country
Now, I found you
Longing in your soft
And fertile delta

And I whisper sighs
To satisfy your longing
For the warm and tender
Shelter of my body

Oh, you're mine delta lady
Your mine, be all mine
Delta lady

Please don't ask
How many times I found you
Standing wet
And naked in the garden

And I think of the days
And the different ways I held you
I held you closely to me
Yes, our heart was beating

Oh, you're mine delta lady
You're mine, be all mine
Delta lady

When I'm home again in England
And I'm thinking of you love
Because, I love you
Yes, I do, I love you

There are concrete
Mountains in the city
And pretty city women
Live inside them

And yet it seems
The city scene is lacking
I'm so glad you're waiting
For me in the country

Oh, you're mine delta lady
Darling, you're mine, be all mine
Delta lady

(Incomprehensible)

Oh, you're mine delta lady
Darling, you're mine, be all mine
Delta lady

(Incomprehensible)
