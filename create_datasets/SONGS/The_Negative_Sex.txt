They know attention to obedience
The kids and wishes fix and forgotten for my self defence
We all want to f*ck ourselves and rape the world
So the odds of the cops will prevail
And vanity, not bored, not love

Oh no, they can't leave it alone
Oh no, we can't leave it alone

Because a negative sex was born into a bloodline
The negative sex is powerful in our time

Show a man from examp? the alternative
It's all ammunition for the gender bend and the bedroom twist
They say that the fashion's just not feminist
But the sweet and the turn-on sits in the laps of the girls with the balls and the hits

Oh no, they can't leave it alone
Oh no, we can't leave it alone

Because the negative sex was born into a bloodline
The negative sex is powerful in our time
The negative sex was born into a bloodline
The negative sex is powerful in our time

Sex for a lifetime
Sex for a lifetime
Sex for a lifetime
