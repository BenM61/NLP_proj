There's just one place for me, near you
It's like heaven to be near you

Times when we're apart
And I can't face my heart
Say you'll never stay
More than just two lips away

If my hours could be spent near you
I'd be more than content, near you

Make my life worth while
By telling me that I'll spend the rest of my days near you
Near you, near you
Make my life worth while
By telling me that I'll spend the rest of my days near you
Spend the rest of my days near you
