My favorite situations
Are always sticky kinds
I'll be the first to cast stones
I don't let sleeping dogs lie

I?ll sing it from a mountain
Just take me to the top
I?ll scream it 'til my lungs pop
I?ll stand here ?til I drop

The feeling is leaving
It?s all gone, it's deceiving
If we don't stop put me in a coffin
'Cause you and I had absolutely nothing in common

Baby, I know you hate me
And you can't shake me
You make me rock solid, hot and bothered, it don't matter
I can shake you, yeah

You used to be so special
Now I'm bored all the time
You think the same of me too
Just say it don't be shy

The feeling is leaving
It?s all gone, it?s deceiving
If we don't stop put me in a coffin
'Cause you and I had absolutely nothing in common

I used to want you, baby
Now I don't want to, I know you hate me
Time to start moving on, but you still crave me

You just amaze me
I used to want you, and you can change me
Now I don't want to
You make me rock solid, hot and bothered
It don't matter I can shake you

Ohh, baby, it?s been a long time comin'
And it?s just the way its gotta be
But I know this is one thing, one thing we won't fight about
And you can put my name on the dotted line

Yeah, baby, I know you hate me
I used to want you but you still crave me
Now I don't want to, you just amaze me
Time has stopped moving on and you can't shake me

I know you hate me
I used to want you, and you can't shake me
Now I don't want to
You make me rock solid, hot and bothered
It don't matter I can shake you, yeah
