The monster of hate overcomes rational thought
Fast fuse burning the lessons I've been taught
It's just too late to remember who I am
The things that I believe in and the way that I stand
About peace, harmony, respect for fellow man
All that shit just got thrown against the fan
In my violent rage, they say that I am a criminal
There ain't no labels within the human animal
In this world of bigotry and pain
The violence spreads and terror reigns
The opinions in our minds replace our souls
As the human animal takes control
The path of self-destruction has brought me to this point
As modern day society cracks arthritic joints
No mercy is shown, it's hitting all my weak spots
I never had a gun, but now I want to hear gun shots
I sleep not for fear, I get no rest
Twisted in a sense, 'cause my button has been pressed
How many ways have you shown me that you hate me
And then you wonder why what have you done to me lately
I am an animal
The human animal
A human animal
Tension building, I'm being pushed too far
I need a release, take the lid of this jar
My voice seems useless in this situation
Time to take action, release frustration
Everyone has limits, only so much you can take
Antagonizing pressure is the icing on the cake
Physical abuse, induced or subliminal
Open the door, unleash the human animal
Flashes of red my vision of distortion
Like a virus, it spreads, giving each his portion
Contagious psychopath, the vibe is in synch
Movin' like a pack, we're back to basic instincts
Wild at heart, now we show our true colors
In the path of desperation, we forget about our brothers
Who would die for us, now, we die for no man
Deranged from the instance, violence came too hard
Instinctual behavior in the given situation
Leaves us with no call for rationalization
