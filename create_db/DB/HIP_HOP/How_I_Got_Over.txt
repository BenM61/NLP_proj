Uh, uh
Uh, uh-huh

Out in the streets where I grew up
First thing they teach us, not to give a f*ck
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere
Someone has to care

How I got over where the people come apart
Don't nobody care about you; only thing you got is God
Out here in these streets if you get down on your luck
You can stand out with a hand out, but nobody give a f*ck
Out here in these streets every man is for himself
They ain't helpin' no one else; it's a hazard to your health
Livin' life in these cold streets
Hey, who's worryin' 'bout you, babe
When you whylin' out, runnin' 'round in these streets?

Out in the streets where I grew up (how I got over)
First thing they teach us is not to give a f*ck (how I got over)
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere (how I got over)
Someone has to care

Yo, when you on the corner, it's too much drama
Livin' with the police right behind ya
It's always more than a slight reminder
We livin' in a war zone like Rwanda
Before I go back to the Heavenly Father
Pray for me if it ain't too much bother
Whatever don't break me or make me stronger
I feel like I can't take too much longer
It's too much lyin' and too much flyin'
I'm all cried out 'cause I grew up cryin'
They all got a sales pitch I ain't buyin'
They tryin' to convince me that I ain't tryin'
We uninspired, we un-admired
And tired and sick of being sick and tired
Of livin' in the hood where the shots are fired
We dyin' to live, so to live we dyin'
You just like I am

Out on the streets where I grew up (how I got over)
First thing they teach us is not to give a f*ck (how I got over)
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere (somebody, somewhere)
Someone has to care

Somebody's gotta care
And I swear it isn't fair
In suspended animation, we ain't tryin' to go nowhere
Out here in these streets
We're so young and all alone
We ain't even old enough to realize we're on our own
Livin' life in these hard streets
Where it's like they lost they mind
Is there anyway to find
Are we runnin' out of time out here?
Listen
Hey, who's worryin' 'bout you, babe
When you whylin' out, runnin' 'round in these streets?

Out on the streets where I grew up (how I got over)
First thing they teach us is not to give a f*ck (how I got over)
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere (somebody, somewhere)
Someone has to care

Out in the streets where I grew up
First thing they teach us, not to give a f*ck
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere
Someone has to care
Out in the streets where I grew up
First thing they teach us, not to give a f*ck
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere
Someone has to care
Out in the streets where I grew up
First thing they teach us, not to give a f*ck
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere
Someone has to care
