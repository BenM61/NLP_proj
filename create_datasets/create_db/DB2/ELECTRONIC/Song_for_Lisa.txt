No matter how well you play your hand
You cannot go home again! No!
No matter how well you play your hands
You cannot go home again! No!

We go walking far from here
I see nothing in the lines of your face!
You are falling
Falling away from here
Give me something in your place!

No matter how well you sprung your face
You cannot go home again!
No matter how far your challenge is
You cannot go home again!

We go walking far from here
I see nothing in the lines of your face!
You are falling
Falling away from here
Give me something in your place

We go walking far from here
I see nothing in the lines of your face!
You are falling
Falling away from here
Give me something in your place
