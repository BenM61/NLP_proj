Me and you
Let's get away from it all
Me and you
Havin' a ball

You know
We've been together a long time
And you know what
We can get a little old lightweight thang goin'
If we really put our hearts to it
You try and I try
Girl, there's no tellin' how far we can go
Remember those lovin' fools Romeo and Juliet
They thought they had a thing goin'
But they just didn't know, they couldn't visualize
They had no idea how it would really be
But we know

Me and you
Let's get away
Me and you
Havin' a ball

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, yeah

Yes, Lord
We know, don't we, darlin'
We won't be wastin' our time fussin' and fightin'
Like other people
We're gonna be too busy bein' in love
But love, this is the real thing
We found a groove, heh
We move each other
We turn each other on
This could last forever
All we need to do is give some kinda sign
Yes, Lord
From then on, baby, it's easy
Let's talk about me and you

Me and you
Let's get away
Me and you
