I've been roaming around
Always looking down and all I see
Painted faces fill the places I can't reach

You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody

Someone like you
And all you know
And how you speak
Countless lovers undercover of the street

You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you oh oh oh 
Someone like you oh oh oh 

Off in the night
While you live it up I'm off to sleep
Waging wars to shake the poet and the beat

I hope it's gonna make you notice
I hope it's gonna make you notice

Someone like me oh oh oh 
Someone like me oh oh oh 
Yeah

I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready now
I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready now

Oh oh oh 
Someone like me oh oh oh 
I've been roaming around
Always looking down and all I see
