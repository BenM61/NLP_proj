There was a rumour on the grapevine
The word had got around
There was a party goin' on
On the wild side of town
I said to Jody "do you wanna go?"
Now Jody likes to party
And I knew she wouldn't say no
Well we got the right street
But we got the wrong number
Then like a shot in the dark 
We heard that thunder

Of the party to end all parties
Wildest one in the book
Party to end all parties
Step inside and take a look

Motor Bikin' Bobby said to Sleazy Sue
I know exactly what we are gonna do
We're goin' upstairs gonna lock the bedroom door
We're gonna party till we can't party anymore

At the party to end all parties
Turn of the century
Party to end all parties
A riot in the first degree

Party to end all parties
Party on the wild side of town
Party to end all parties
We ain't ever gonna live this down

Two guys in the bathroom
They've been there for an hour
Somebody said that they were takin' a shower
Jimmy couldn't wait so he kicked down the door
Found his girlfriend and the two guys
Havin' a party on the floor

At the party to end all parties
Wildest one in the book
Party to end all parties
Step inside and take a look ... at the party

Party to end all parties
Party on the wild side of town
Party to end all parties
We ain't ever gonna live this down
