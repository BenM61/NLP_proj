What you thinkin' about?
You and me goin' one-on-one (Say what)
JD y'all (Uh huh, So So Def)
MC y'all (What you think about)
I'm the man to fulfill your needs
Get you everything that you see in your dreams (C'mon)
Baby, lighten up and let nobody tear us apart
If forever you'll be my sweetheart

Boy haven't you noticed
A gleam in my eye
Because of you
I'm a little hypnotized
But every time you're with me
I feel so positive
Now with a little love
Something's got to give

A full moon (Yeah yeah)
Is waiting in the twilight
Maybe soon
You will come to be my night
Here we are
Hoping that we never part
Stay with me

Baby, won't you be my sweetheart
We could share a storybook romance
Won't you be my sweetheart
We could share a storybook romance
Just you and I

You are no Casanova
I know that you'll be true
And that's why
I'm so in love with you
But each romantic ending
You leave me at my door
But tonight
I'd like us to explore

A full moon
Is waiting in the twilight
Maybe soon
You will come to be my night
Here we are
Hoping that we never part
Stay with me

Baby, won't you be my sweetheart
We could share a storybook romance
Won't you be my sweetheart
We could share a storybook romance
Just you and I

See, I saw you at the party
With your eyes on me
Fittin' the description
On what I want my bride to be (Ha, ha)
As live as me
Don't know the same guys as me
But a lot of style
And usin' wild name like Ivory
I agree with my niggas
You the baddest I ever seen in a long time (Uh)
But woman with her own shine
Is on time
And I don't hit
'Cause I'm tired of dealin' with the wrong kind
Getting non' but the bullshit
She got a playa tryin' to think of new things to say (Sup, baby)
She up in the corner sippin' Don P, Rosee' (Yeah)
Shakin' it up with the homegirls
Payin' no attention to us
They in they own world
'Hey, yo, girl'
I'm the man to fulfill your needs
Get you everything you see in your dreams
Baby, lighten up and let nobody tear us apart
If forever you'll be my sweetheart

Sounds so right (Uh, huh)
The mood is right
Say what, MC, baby, sing it to me
To keep me warm
Away from harm
Nowhere better than my baby's arms
Sounds so right (Uh, huh)
The mood is right
Say what, MC, baby, sing it to me 
To keep me warm
Away from harm

Won't you be my sweetheart
We could share a storybook romance
Won't you be my sweetheart
We could share a storybook romance
Just you and I

Sweetheart
We could share a storybook romance
Won't you be my sweetheart
We could share a storybook romance
Just you and I

You know I need your love
