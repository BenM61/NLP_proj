Give me that (x4)
You can give me something
Like I've never have before
To your charms I could surrender
If you do the right thing
I'm gonna love you even more
I don't say forget the lust
But my heart you must remember
Something in the air
Made me feel that you are getting near
Man like you
Was my dream but now I've got you here
I've been waiting for you
'Cause I believe in love at first sight
Listen to me and everything is gonna be all right
You can give me something
Like I've never have before
To your charms I could surrender
If you do the right thing
I'm gonna love you even more
I don't say forget the lust
But my heart you must remember
You're a naughty boy
It seems that my words still pass you by
Can't you see
There is more to me than meets the eye
I've been waiting for you
'Cause I believe in love at first sight
Listen to me and everything is gonna be all right
Give me that(x7)
Oh baby let's stay together
'Cause we're made for each other's arms
Let be smile on ever
There's no one I would rather
You can give me something
Like I've never have before
To your charms I could surrender
If you do the right thing
I'm gonna love you even more
I don't say forget the lust
But my heart you must remember
Give me that (x11)
I don't say forget the lust (x2)
