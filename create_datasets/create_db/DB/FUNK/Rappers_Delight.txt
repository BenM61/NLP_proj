I said a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop, a you don't stop
The rock it to the bang bang boogie
Say up jumped the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

Now what you hear is not a test
I'm rappin' to the beat
And me, the groove, and my friends
Are gonna try to move your feet

See I am Wonder Mike and I like to say hello
To the black, to the white,
The red, and the brown, the purple and yellow
But first I gotta bang bang the boogie to the boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie
Let's rock, you don't stop
Rock the riddle that will make your body rock

Well so far you've heard my voice
But I brought two friends along
And next on the mike is my man Hank
Come on, Hank, sing that song

Check it out
To the rhythm of the boogie da bang bang da bong
Well, I'm imp the dimp the ladies pimp
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three mcs
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside, into the front
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker mcs try to prove a point
We're treacherous trio, we're the serious joint
A from sun to sun and from day to day
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mike til you can't resist
Everybody, I say it goes like this
Well I was comin' home late one dark afternoon
A reporter stopped me for a interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mike and the turntables
This young reporter I did adore
So I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before
She said damn fly guy I'm in love with you
The Casanova legend must have been true
I said by the way baby what's your name
Said I go by the name of Lois Lane
And you could be my boyfriend you surely can
Just let me quit my boyfriend called superman
I said he's a fairy I do suppose
Flyin' through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy or even cute
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit
I said you need a man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night
But can he rock a party til the early light
He can't satisfy you with his little worm
But I can bust you out with my super sperm
I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it , do it
An I'm here and I'm there
I'm big bang Hank, I'm everywhere
Just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it don't stop
Why'all a tick a tock why'all you don't stop
Go hotel, motel what you gonna do today (say what)
I'm gonna get a fly girl
Gonna get some spank drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go hotel, motel Holiday Inn
You say if your girl starts actin' up
Then you take her friend
I say skip, dive, what can I say
I can't fit em all inside my OJ
So I just take half and bust them out
I give the rest to Master Gee
So he could shock the house

I said m-a-s, t-e-are, a g with a double e
I said I go by the unforgettable name
Of the man they call the master gee
Well, my name is known all over the world
By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls
I'm goin' down in history
As the baddest rapper there could ever be
Now I'm feelin' the highs and ya feelin' the lows
The beat starts gettin' into your toes
Ya start poppin' ya fingers and stompin' your feet
And movin' your body while you're sittin' in your seat
And the damn ya start doin' the freak
I said damn, right outta your seat
Then ya throw your hands high in the air
Ya rockin' to the rhythm, shake your derriere
Ya rockin' to the beat without a care
With the sureshot MC's for the affair
Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same
I dot a little face and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do ladies is hypnotize
Singin on n n on n on n on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin on n n on n on on n on
Like a hot buttered a
Pop da pop da pop dibbie dibbie
Pop da pop pop ya don't dare stop
Come alive y'all gimme what ya got
I guess by now you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay I still keep in stride
Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind
Singin on n n on n on n on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin on n n on n on on n on
Rock rock y'all throw it on the floor
I'm gonna freak ya here I'm gonna freak ya there
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere
Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind
Ill put t-t-tickets in your behind
I said one, two, three, four, come on girls get on the floor
A-come alive, y'all a-gimme what ya got
Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said one, two, three, four
Tell me Wonder Mike what are you waitin for?

I said a hip hop the hippie to the hippie
The hip hip hop, a you don't stop
The rock it to the bang bang boogie
Say up jumped the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat
Skiddlee beebop a we rock a scoobie doo
And guess what America we love you
Cause ya rock and ya roll with so much soul
You could rock till you're a hundred and one years old
I don't mean to brag I don't mean to boast
But we like hot butter on our breakfast toast
Rock it up baby bubbah
Baby bubbah to the boogie da bang bang da boogie
To the beat, beat, its so unique
Come on everybody and dance to the beat



I said a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop, a you don't stop
Rock it out baby bubbah to the boogie da bang bang
The boogie to the boogie da beat
I said I can't wait til the end of the week
When I'm rappin to the rhythm of a groovy beat
And attempt to raise your body heat
Just blow your mind so that you can't speak
And do a thing but a rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called the freak
And when ya finally do come in to your rhythmic beat
Rest a little while so ya don't get weak
I know a man named hank
He has more rhymes than a serious bank
So come on hank sing that song
To the rhythm of the boogie da bang bang da bong
Well, I'm imp the dimp the ladies pimp
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three mcs
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside, into the front
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker mcs try to prove a point
