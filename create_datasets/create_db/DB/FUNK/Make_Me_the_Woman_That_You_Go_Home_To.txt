You promised me
Things that meant a lot
Said so much you
Just up and forgot
What you said
To me, about me

You said I was your strength
The air you breathe
So help me, honey
You're all I need to
Make my life complete
Oh, yes, you did

So then
(Why, why don't you)
Why don't you, baby
(Make her the woman
You go home to)
Make me the woman
You go home to

And not the one
You leave behind
(Make her the woman
You go home to)
Not the one you left to cry
(Make her the woman
You go home to)

With a smile
I fix your evening meals
Iron your clothes
It ain't no big deal
It's all a part of loving you
(Loving you, yes, it is)

Stand by your side
Through thick and thin
Not laying awake to
Ask where you been
Cause you'd tell me
If you wanted to
(If you wanted to)
Oh, yeah

(Why, why don't you)
Why don't you, baby
(Make her the woman
You go home to)
Make me the woman
You go home to

And not the one
You leave behind
(Make her the woman
You go home to)
Not that one that's
Left to cry and cry
(Make her the woman
You go home to)

(Make her the woman
You go home to) you
Make me the woman
(Make her the woman
You go home to)
You go home to

Make me yours and
You'll be mine to keep
So full of joy, you wouldn't
Need to be on the
Other side of town
Fooling around

So (why, why don't you)
Why, why, why
Good God almighty, boy
(Make her the woman
You go home to)

And not that one
That you leave behind
(Make her the woman
You go home to)
Not the one that's
Left to cry and cry
(Make her the woman
You go home to)...

I don't, I don't
I don't know what you want
Make me your woman, oh, baby...
