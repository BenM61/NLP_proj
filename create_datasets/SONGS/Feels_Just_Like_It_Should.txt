I'm coming down to see ya
I'm looking for fast and cheap
I'm looking for the back of the streets
(Yeah-ow)
I'm gonna get experience
I'm here to see the candy man
To turn it up and drown

Feels just like it should 
(Yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should 
(Yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should
(I know I'll get experience)
(Yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should
Turn it up and drown

I'm going on a laser beam
To shoot some cheries down
I'm acting like a free agent
I got myself a fine wide smile
So baby for the first time
I need a little sugar 'n' spice
(Yeah-ow)
I want to see the city lights
I know I found her number

Feels just like it should
(Yeah-0w)
Feels just like it should
(Yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should
(Yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should
I'm looking for a fancy chick

Feels just like it should
I'm looking for the back of the streets
(Yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should
I'm gonna get experience
(Yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should
I'm here to see the candy man
(Yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should

Sugar-spice I'm on the phone
I'm outside
In a mean little street from the back town
I want you
I want to lick you up and down
Feels good
She said it would feel that good
And it does

(Yeah-ow)
(Yeah-ow)
And it feels, it feels, it feels
And it feels, it feels, it feels
And it feels, it feels, it feels
Just like you
Just like you said it would
(Yeah-ow)

Feels just like it should
(Yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should
I'm coming down tonight to taste y'all
Sugar-spice I want you, a sexy girl
Slips in, it feels good
Feels just like it should
