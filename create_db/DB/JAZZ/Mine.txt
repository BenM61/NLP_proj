Mine love is mine
Whether it rain or storm or shine
Mine you are mine
Never another valentine

And I am yours tell me that I'm yours
Show me that smile my heart adores
Mine more than divine
To know that love like yours is mine

Mine, love is mine
Whether it rain or storm or shine
Mine, you are mine
Never another valentine

And I am yours tell me that I'm yours
Show me that smile my heart adores
Mine, more than divine
To know that love like yours is mine
