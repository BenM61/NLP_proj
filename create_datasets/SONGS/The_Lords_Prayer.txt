Our Father
Who art in Heaven
Hallowed be Thy name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done
On earth as it is in Heaven

Give us today
Our daily bread
And forgive our sins
As we forgive
Each one of those
Who sins against us
And lead us
Not to the time of trial
But deliver us from evil
For Thine is the kingdom
The power and the glory

Let all the people
Say amen
In every tribe
And tongue
Let every heart's
Desire be joined
To see the kingdom come
Let every hope
And every dream
Be born in love again
Let all the world
Sing with one voice
Let the people
Say amen
