I'm more tired than you as I reach down to tuck you into bed
I've got to find the bear and the tiger that sleep beside your head
This love that I feel is ferocious as a lion
So brave and so gentle that I almost feel like crying

It's a great big world
It's a great big moon
It's a great big sky
It's a great big love for you

It's a great big world
It's a great big moon
It's a great big sky
It's a great big love for you

Then I tell you a story of a lion who's your best friend
He gets you into trouble but he brings you home safe in the end
Someday all these stories may come to life as true
When a child of your own can wake that lion in you

It's a great big world
It's a great big moon
It's a great big sky
It's a great big love for you

It's a great big world
It's a great big moon
It's a great big sky
It's a great big love for you
It's a great big love for you
