Daybreak, another new day
The mist on the meadow is drifting away
For it's daybreak, the sun's in the sky now
And flowers break through their blanket of dew

Sunrise, how lovely it seems
To see from my window a sky full of dreams
As the white clouds sail on through the blue
At daybreak I did dream of you
