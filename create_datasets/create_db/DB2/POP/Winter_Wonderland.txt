Johnny Mercer 
with Paul Weston and the Pied Pipers 
Winter Wonderland 
"Now for a little change in pace we've sent Johnny Mercer up to the bandstand to join Paul Weston and the Pied Pipers in the nostalgic song of Christmas time, Winter Wonderland." 
      Sleigh bells ring.
      Are you listening?
      In the lane,
      snow is glistening.
      A beautiful sight.
      We're happy tonight
      walking in a winter wonderland.

      Gone away is the bluebird;
      here to stay is a new bird.
      He sings a love song
      as we go along
      walking in a winter wonderland

      In the meadow we can build a snowman
      Then pretend that he is Parson Brown 
      He'll say, "Are you married?"
      We'll say, "No man."
      But you can do the job when you're in town

      Later on, we'll conspire
      as we dream 
      by the fire 
      To face unafraid
      the plans that we've made
      walking in a winter wonderland

      We'll pretend our snowman's parson brown
      He'll say, "Are you married?" 
      We'll say, "No man."
      But you can do the job 
      when you're in town.  Ooh ooh!
      Later on, we'll conspire
      as we dream 
      by the fire 
      To face unafraid
      the plans that we've made
      walking in a winter wonderland.
