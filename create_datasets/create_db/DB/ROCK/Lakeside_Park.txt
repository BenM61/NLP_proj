Midway hawkers calling "try your luck with me"
Merry-go-round wheezing  the same old melody
A thousand ten-cent wonders, who could ask for more?
A pocketful of silver, the key to heaven's door 

Lakeside Park
Willows in the breeze
Lakeside Park
So many memories
Laughing rides
Midway lights
Shining stars
On summer nights 

Days of barefoot freedom racing with the waves
Nights of starlit secrets, crackling driftwood flames
Drinking by the lighthouse, smoking on the pier
Still we saw the magic was fading every year 

Lakeside Park
Willows in the breeze
Lakeside Park
So many memories
Laughing rides
Midway lights
Shining stars
On summer nights 

Everyone would gather 
On the twenty-fourth of May 
Sitting in the sand 
To watch the fireworks display 
Dancing fires on the beach 
Singing songs together 
Though it's just a memory, some memories last forever
