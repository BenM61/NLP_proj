Yeah, ooh
Oh, girl
Yeah

You're such a motivating
Tantalizing picture of desire
I'd like to take you home
And tenderly light your lovin' fire, alright

In case you wonder if I'm qualified
Here are my credentials, ooh
I've loved a thousand girls around the world
But never reached my potential, no

I feel the girls in Paris
I make love in Spain
And all around the world
Said the women know my name, they call me

Sexomatic

Well, sexomatic

Ooh, ooh

I like my women soft and I love 'em wait
With constant stimulation, yes, I do
Just the thought of you
Really fills me with anticipation, yes, it does

Don't be afraid of my reputation
I won't leave you brokenhearted, no
But there is one thing you should know
Before we get this lovin' started, alright

I feel the girls in Paris
I make love in Spain
And all around the world
Said the women know my name, they call me
