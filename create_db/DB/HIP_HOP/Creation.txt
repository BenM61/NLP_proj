Gimme no slack and I give it right back
Cos the punch I pack's gonna come with a smack
Cos I'm like that exactly like that
And if I slip there's no excuse for that
It gets deep but I can't control
The road is steep and full of pit holes
Cheap and nasty sophistication
But all I seein' is pure creation
A solo station for civilization
Congregating in another dimension
Don't ask me why I don't understand it
It's just the way nature planned it

I'm talking about creation
I'm talking about relations
I'm talking about creation
We need some combination

To a hairs breath how we gonna do it
You want to look but you knew it you blew it
Out of proportion no I don't think so
This thing's bigger than both of us so
Drop your anchor and weigh your thoughts
Like mega ton bombs droppin' on your front porch
A real summer breeze that's gonna be
When they don't exist and neither do we

I'm talking about creation
I'm talking about relations
I'm talking about creation
We need some combination

So don't lose track when the wall's at your back
And you're under attack hold on to your hat
As trouble always comes ion sax o' tax
Dark blue astras plain clothes slacks
Hard facts kept under wraps
Scared to risk your neck less your head be axed
Cos all the kings horses and all the kings men
Ain't gonna put us back together again
My friend my brother my foe my ego
My mother my father my bride my pride
New life I can see it in your eyes
Improvise watch the spirit rise

I'm talking about creation
I'm talking about relations
I'm talking about creation
We need some motivation I don't shirk the work
Come strong like Hercules
Till I seize your heartbeat and make it freeze
So you know I'm authentic

And when I said that I don't let up I really meant it
I'm full of beans co s I eat my greens
I'm like Mr Lean I love the way you scream
I see jungles forests rivers streams
Grand Canyon mountains seas and livin' beings
Sweet dreams are made of these things
And the power to raise up my limbs
To all these gifts I wanna dedicate
Every hour I spend and every second I take

I'm talking about creation
I'm talking about relations
I'm talking about creation
We need some combination
