Where have all the flowers gone?
A long time passing
Where have all the flowers gone?
A long ago

Where have all the flowers gone?
Girl, they're picked up, every one
When will they ever learn?
When will they ever learn?

Where have all the soldiers gone?
Long time passing
Where have all the soldiers gone?
A long ago

Where have all the soldiers gone?
They've gone to graveyards every one
When will they ever learn?
When will they ever learn?

When will they learn? Ever learn
When will they learn?
When will they learn? Ever learn
When will they ever learn?
When will they ever learn?

If you don't know what we're talkin' about
When we say this
There's too many starvin' children
If ya don't know what we're killing each other
And we just ain't got time for ya brother
No, no, hey, hey
