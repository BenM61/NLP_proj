Jamie's on the bathroom floor she don't know why
She's shaking underneath the sink can't feel a thing
She'd love to live a life she's afraid of failure
With all the voices in her head
Now what was that I thought I hear you scream

I know you can feel it
You're already there
Asleep underwater
Just screaming for air
I know you can feel it
You're already
Don't you know we're freaks and creature
Wake up I can almost see the light

I think we're alone here you and I
I think we're alone left wondering why
I think we're alone here you and I
I think we're alone in the universe tonight

Alex on the last train home from god knows where
A million miles away from where he thought he'd be
He's got his suit his tie his drink his MTV
He's trading all his life away
You can't escape we're all infected now

I know you can feel it
You're already there
Asleep underwater
Just screaming for air
I know you can feel it
You're already
Don't you know we're freaks and creatures
Wake up I can almost see the light

I think we're alone here you and I
I think we're alone in the universe tonight

We're all infected now
I know you can feel it
You're already there
Asleep underwater
Just screaming for air
I know you can feel it
You're already
Don't you know we're freaks and creatures
Wake up I can almost see the light

I think we're alone here you and I
I think we're alone left wondering why
I think we're alone here you and I
I think we're alone in the universe tonight

I think we're alone in the universe tonight
I think we're alone in the universe tonight
