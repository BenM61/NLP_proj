Fools rush in
Where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you my love
My heart above my head
Fools rush in
Where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you my love
My heart above my head

Rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love
So how are they to know

When we met
Where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you my love
My heart above my head
Fools rush in
Where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you my love
My heart above my head

Rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love
So how are they to know oh, oh, oh, oh

When we met
Where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you my love
My heart above my head
Fools rush in
Where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you my love
My heart above my head

Care, fool, fool
Care, fool

Fools rush in
Where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you my love
My heart above my head

Fools rush in
Where angels fear to tread
