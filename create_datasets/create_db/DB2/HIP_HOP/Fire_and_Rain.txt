Yesterday morning they let me know you were gone
Looks like the plans we made put an end to you
Walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
Just can't remember where to send it to

I've seen fire and I've seen rain
Seen sunny days that I thought would never end
Seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
Oh, But I always thought that I'd see you again

Won't you look down on me, Jesus
You've got to help me make a stand
Just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
I won't make it any other way

Oh, oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
Seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again, yeah

I've been walking my mind to an easy time
Back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows turns you head around
Spend hours of time on the telephone line talking about things to come
But all dreams and flying machine fell to pieces on the ground

I've seen fire and I've seen rain
Seen sunny days that I thought would never end
Seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you, again, yeah ooh

Oh no no, no oh oh oh yeah

I've been walking my mind to an easy time
Back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows turns you head around, yeah
Spend hours of time on the telephone line talking about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines fell to pieces on the ground

Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain, oh
Seen sunny days that I thought would never end, oh no
Seen lonely times when I could not find a friend no, oh
But I always thought that I'd see you again,
I thought I'd see you once again

Oh, again again
Oh, again again
See you
Again again
Again again
Oh

Again again
Again again
Oh

See you
Again again
See you
Ooh yeah

Again again
Again again
See you

Again again
Again again
Again again
See you

Again again
Again again
Oh
