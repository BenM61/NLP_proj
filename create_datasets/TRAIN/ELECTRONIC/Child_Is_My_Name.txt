Immortal angels
Dressed up as junkies
I'm going out tonight
It's gonna be alright

It's gonna happen
It's gonna happen, right?
It's gonna happen
It's gonna happen

I take the blame
And child is my name
And I believe your words
Whatever you might say
This is my hand
Shaking and raised
Reaching out for something more
Than mere play

Immortal junkies
Dressed up as angels
I'm meeting you tonight
It's gonna be alright

It's gonna happen
