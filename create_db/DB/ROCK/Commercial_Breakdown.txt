Yeah 
Oh Maybe I'm right 
Oh maybe I'm wrong 
We can fight for 
One single way to get along 
And we've all got to not shake down! 
And I've only missin' a point 
And I can't search the way to try to telling lies 

So I'll tell my problem 
You're never gonna get me 
If I'm too be busy 
A social conscience 
I saw it on the tv 
At least it keeps me busy
At least it keeps me busy

Oh maybe sometimes 
I find it hard to comply 
With people that don't look you 
In the eye 
And it's because all the commercial 
Breakdown! 
And I've only missin' a point 
Is what the media's sayin' 
That is switching to 

So I'll tell my problem 
You're never gonna get me 
We're far too busy 
And so's your conscience 
What story gonna save me 
At least it keeps me busy 

Oh 
And I used to think that these things happen for a reason 
I used to think that these things happen for a reason 
I used to think that these things happen for a reason
