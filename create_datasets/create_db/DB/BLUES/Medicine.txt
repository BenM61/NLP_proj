I'm losing my mind, babe, the worse things happen I fear
Begging for mercy, there ain't no connection out here
I'm getting sick of these things that's going on
My fever's high, my nights are long
One more shot to do me in

Bring me my medicine
Bring me my medicine

A hard times are holding me against my will
I'm so tired that I can't find my flip
I'm stuck in the middle of the right and wrong
I don't know what keeps me hanging on
Baby, can't you see what a shape I'm in?

Bring me my medicine
Bring me my medicine
Yeah, yeah, my baby, hey

It's so good when medicine hits my vein
Just one time and I ain't never been the same
People try to find out what's the deal
All I know is how it makes me feel
Maybe this is pushing (Incomprehensible)

Oh, bring me my medicine
Bring me my medicine, baby

Losing my mind, babe, the worse things happen I fear
Begging for mercy, there ain't no connection out here
I'm getting sick of these things that's going on
My fever's high, my nights are long
One more shot could do me in, baby

Bring me my medicine
Bring me my medicine
Oh baby, oh babe, oh babe, oh
