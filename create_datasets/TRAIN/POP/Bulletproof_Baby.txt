You only tell us what we're not
So what? You, you
You love it when we bleed, you feed
Some people just despise
The diamonds in our eyes
You only love us 'cause we're hot
So what? Yeah, yeah
We take it on the rocks rolled up
Heard it a thousand times
Why don't you speak your mind, yeah
'Cause when all is said and done

We got to say
Yeah, yeah, hey
We're bulletproof, baby
Go ahead and take your shot
Yeah, yeah, oi, oi
Keep on making that noise
Give it all you got
Oh, oh, oh, oh
We got to say
Yeah, yeah, hey
We're bulletproof, baby oh

They only squeeze us for the juice
Abuse, ta ta
Take anything they throw, you know
They stab the knife and twist
The colour off these lips
They say we're just a bunch of fakes, just wait ha, ha
How quick are all the stones they throw
And that's why they're on our case
Afraid we'll take their place
But when all is said and done

We got to say
Yeah, yeah, hey
We're bulletproof, baby
Go ahead and take your shot
Yeah, yeah, oi, oi
Keep on making that noise
Give it all you got
Oh, oh, oh, oh
We got to say
Yeah, yeah, hey
We're bulletproof, baby oh
Bulletproof, baby let's go

Yeah, yeah, hey
We're bulletproof, baby
Go ahead and take your shot
Come on
Oh, but when all is said and done

We got to say
Yeah, yeah, hey
We're bulletproof, baby
Go ahead and take your shot
Yeah, yeah, oi, oi
Keep on making that noise
Give it all you got (Give it all you got)
Oh, oh, oh, oh

We got to say
Yeah, yeah, hey
We're bulletproof, baby
Go ahead and take your shot (We don't do nothing wrong)
Yeah, yeah, oi, oi
Keep on making that noise
Give it all you got (We are number one)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
We got to say
Yeah, yeah, hey
We're bulletproof, baby oh
