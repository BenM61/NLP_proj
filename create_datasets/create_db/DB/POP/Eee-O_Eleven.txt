One day I'll have me a
chauffeur... and a block long limousine
Eee-o-Eleven.
Eee-o-Eleven.

Someday I'll have me a penthouse.
Stacks and stacks of folding green.
Eee-o-Eleven.
Eee-o-Eleven.

It's all a state of mind.
Whether or not you'll fine.
That place down there or heaven.
In the meantime.
Eee-o Eee -o
Eee - o- Eleven.
Eee- o - Eleven.
Eee- o -Eleven.

Show me a man without a dream.
And I'll show you a man that's dead.
Real Dead.

Once I had me a dream.
But that dream got kicked in the head.
Dream dead.

I nearly had me that chauffeur
And that block long limousine.
Eee-o-Eleven
Eee-o-Eleven

I nearly had me that penthouse.
All them stacks of folding green.
Eee-o-Eleven
Eleven.

Some Judge is gonna say.
I'm putting you away.
For four score years add seven.
In the meantime.
Eee-o-Eleven
Eee-o-Eleven
