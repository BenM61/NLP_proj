I fuckin shit my pants
So smell me bitch, I stink
I am smellin' like the rose
That somebody gave me on
My birthday deathbed
I am smellin' like the rose
That somebody gave me
'Cause I'm dead & bloated
Yeah, and she says it's
Natural

I feel I've come of age
When she peeks I start to run
You can't swallow what I'm
Thinkin'
You can't swallow what I'm
Thinkin'
I run through the world
Thinkin' 'bout tomorrow
I am trampled under sole of
Another man's shoes

Guess I walked too softly
Oh yeah, and she says it's
Natural
I feel I've come of age
When she peeks I start to run
You can't swallow what I'm
Thinkin'
You can't swallow what I'm
Thinkin
