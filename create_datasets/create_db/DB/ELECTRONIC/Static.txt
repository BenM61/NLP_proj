My best friend always used to say
Heed your inner voice
I always followed this advice
And sometimes it worked out fine
But what do I do if my mind is screamin' and orderin' so loud ?
Its shrill voice drowns out
The soft one inside me

And I feel nothing
My mind is givin' orders
And I'm feelin' static

I wish my heart was stronger
But I try to refuse
But I'd lie if I said that I succeed

And when I try to find the reason
My mind goes out on strike
I ask and moan, complain about it
But it doesn't change the facts
In spite of me my mind goes on searchin' for the right way
My inner voices speak to me
But I can't seem to hear them
