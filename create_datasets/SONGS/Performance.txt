Take it easy, check me out 
Take it easy, check me out 

I move from the car wash 
Your hands are not clean 
From your fascist graffiti 
I'm getting kind of tired 
Descending escalators 
To the heart of the subway 
But you are not the only one baby, oh no 
Check me out 

Oh well it's getting kind of silly 
Inadequate bodies are waging a war 
But you better check the situation 
Your mouth is open wide 
But your body's too sore 

Say, but you are not the only one baby 
Check me out 

But my performance is good 
My performance is good 
My performance is good 
For your love 
For your love 
As I perform for you 
Another nervous breakdown 

Well nobody has to suffer 
The camera ejects 
From another location 
Take refuge in the city 
And move on down the line 
Between the cradle of stations 

But you are not the only one baby 
Check me out 

But my performance is good 
My performance is good 
My performance is good 
For your love 
For your love 
As I perform for you 
Another nervous breakdown
