Mama said he'd be a failure
Live down on the Bowery 
somewhere, yeah
Libacious schoolboy with that 
Slicked back hair
Playing your guitar
You rock and you roll...

Listen to American pop
American pop
Listen to American pop - music
Listen to American pop
American pop
Listen to American pop music...

Down on the corner
Turn on your radio
Frankie there you are
Underneath the skyline
The roar and the heat

Listen
American pop
Listen
American music
Listen
American pop
Listen
American music

VOCAL BREAKDOWN
Mama look at your boy now

Listen to American pop
American pop
Listen to American pop - music
Listen to American pop
American pop
Listen to American pop music
