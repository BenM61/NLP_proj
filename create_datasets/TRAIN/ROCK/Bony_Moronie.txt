Â  

I got a girl named Bony Moronie.
She's as skinny as a stick of macaroni.
Ought to see her rock and roll with her blue jeans on.
She's not very fat, just skin and bone.
But I love her and she loves me.
We're all happy now as we can be.
Making love underneath the apple tree.

Well, I told her mama and her papa too
Just exactly what I want to do.
I want to get married on a night in June,
And rock and roll by the light of the silvery moon.
Cause I love her and she loves me,
We're all happy now as we can be.
Making love underneath the apple tree.

She's my one and only, she's my heart's desire.
She's a real upsetter, she's a real live wire.
Everybody turns when my baby goes by.
She's something to see, she really catches the eye.
I love her and she loves me,
We're all happy now, as we can be.
Making love underneath the apple tree.
