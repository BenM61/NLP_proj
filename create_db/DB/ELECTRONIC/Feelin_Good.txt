I want the view from the top of the hill
Give me the view from the top of the hill

When I think of you
And your good life
And your sorrow too
How much I'm missing you
No matter where I go
Or where I come to stay
This is waking up
I want this feeling
Doors wide open

And now I leave it all
Bags of trouble
And a messy mind
Oh I hope I find
Where your load is light
Where your heart's at ease
This is waking up
And feeling good, feeling good

Hey, I'm making my mistakes
'Cause I'm no great shakes at being perfect
I just take my breaks and work it
Bring it to the surface
Like a scuba diver
Never nervous
Cause now I'm older and wiser
An' I've a bold feelin'
This old skin is peeln'
Revealing a new layer
I'm no soothsayer
But I feel it's time to leave
To polish my heart with the other sleeve

I want the view from the top of the hill
Give me the view from the top of the hill
I want the view from the top of the hill
Give me the view from the top of the hill

And feeling good, feeling good
