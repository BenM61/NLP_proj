The sun shines red
Over the sand
Psycho shutter speed
Red eye red eye
Buried forgotten
Left to the dust
Instructions are haywire
Unearth the voyeur

He's in here with me
Gets him out of my head
Eyes plugged in to my veins
The devil walks in the sand

See all we see
And touch all we breathe
Feel his dreams through us
Living the recess
Woken in hunger
Electron alarm
Uncle Sam is spared
The carrion keeper

He's in here with me
Gets him out of my head
Eyes plugged in to my veins

The devil walks in the sand

(She knows his name)
(She knows his name)
(She knows his name) The devil treads the sand
(She knows his name) Stopping all she can

(She knows his name) The devil treads the sand
(She knows his name) Stopping all she can

He's in here with me
Gets him out of my head
Eyes plugged in to my veins
The devil walks in the sand

He's in here with me
Gets him out of my head
Eyes plugged in to my veins
The devil walks in the sand
