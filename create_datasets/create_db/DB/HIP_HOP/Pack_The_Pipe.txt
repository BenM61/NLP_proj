Trapped in the cockpit at forty thousand feet
The sky is the limit, but we superscede
The greed for the speed is like way beyond limits
I grab my parachute with like forks and spoons in it
And I'm falling, I'm falling, my heart rapid rushes
Death before my eyes, oh why did I trust this?
My reactions are repeated over and over and over
Oh it seems like I will never be sober

(Get up, pack it in, I get high, I love gettin' high, I'mma get high
'Til I die, can I have a light my brother, where is my bud?)

The pipe, the pipe
Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe
Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe
Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe
Let's pack the pipe

I look in every hip-hop magazine it seems
That the blunts are being passed around the scenes in teams
And the ganja man with contraband in lesser amounts
I guess 'cause understands he has his chance passes like Fouts
But his pass is incomplete 'cause I can tell in the smell
To let the dutchy pass me by, let the left catch hell
If I wanted to smoke tobacco I'd get a skinny white bitch
I know that Fatlip carries a pack to cure the nicotine itch
Because the only itch I have is for the indo or sess
So don't pass me that mess or try to even protest
That it's adding to the flavor 'cause the old one was fine
Won't you pack the pipe and keep it moving down the line

The pipe, the pipe
Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe
Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe
Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe
Let's pack the pipe

I got a big ol' blunt, I'm lampin' on my front porch
About to put a torch to it, then Coco said don't do it
Please don't hit that shit in front of my little four year old son
She sent him inside the house meanwhile my Sheri steadily rolled one
After the other, then another, 'cause I'm rollin' in the dough
So we rolling the indo as if the kid didn't know
He's lookin' through the window, yo why we tryin' to hide it?
To make a boy grow to be ignorant and misguided
About the bud!? Now I have to play the part of the adviser
Because the bud is just the tasty tantalizer
The bud not the beer 'cause the bud makes me wiser
(Figaro) So I said come here little man
And with his little hand, he grabbed the pipe
A lesson in buddah blessin', not too young, just right
So he started blazin', it was amazin'
My lungs are black and shriveled up like a raisin
But who am I to deny the kid a try
At nature's little way of sayin' hi?
So pack

The pipe, the pipe
Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe
Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe
Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe
Let's pack the pipe

Twisting turning burning
Rings of fire when I come into ya layer
Say ya pay yer fare for the fee
I see
The pipe, the pipe is what I like
I'm Imani and I'm hype give me the pipe tonight
I really wanna smoke it, I really want to smoke it
I choke it
The endo no jokin'
I'm doin' it like this

I hope I do not get this by anybody
By anybody
By anybody
By anybody
What? Uh huh uh huh

Why does your mother smoke pipe
With crack on the inside
She likes to take a bus ride with a sherm stick in her mouth
Preachin' about
What the world's goin' on
I don' know what's up
The bitch smokes
A lotta heroin
Every day a hard
Basehead
I don' know what to say

The pipe, the pipe
Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe
Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe
Let's pack the pipe

I saw ya
The pipe dammit!
