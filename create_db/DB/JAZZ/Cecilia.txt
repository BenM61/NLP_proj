Little Miss Cecilia Green
Little over sweet sixteen
But the cutest flapper that you've ever seen
When the fellows pass her by
She will always wink her eye
When she talks to them
When she walks with them
This is what they'll cry

Does your mother know you're out Cecilia?
Does she know that I'm about to steal you?
Oh my when I look in your eyes
Something tells me you and I should get together

How bout a little kiss Cecilia
Just a kiss you'll never miss Cecilia
Why do we two keep on wasting time?
Oh Cecilia
Say that you'll be mine

Many funny things occur
While the boys are courting her
I refer to one case in particular
She went with a boy named Joe
Who was always lisping so
When he'd ask this miss
For a little kiss it would sound just like this

Doeth your mother know you're out The-thiel-yuh
Doeth thee know that I'm about to thteal "yuh"
Oh my when I look in your eyth
I feel very you know tho un-neth-the-tha-ry
How about a little kiss The-thiel-yuh
Jutht a kith you'll never mith The-thiel-yuh
Why do we two keep on wathting time?
Oh The-thiel-yuh
Thay that you'll be mine
Mine How about a little kith, the thiel yuh
Jutht  a kith you'll never mith, the thiel yuh.
Why do we two keep on wathing time 
Oh, the theil yuh
