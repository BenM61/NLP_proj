I tried to play it cool
Pretending that you're not on my mind
For so long I've been the fool
But it ain't gonna happen this time.

Every day, every night
All I do is sit and think about you
It goes on endlessly
There's no way I can't deny
Everything I feel inside
I want to show you
I need to hold you
'Cause words are not enough

I'm in it for love
I'm in it for you
I love everything you say and do
You're all that I need
I want you to see that I
Can't wait another minute
'Cause you know I'm in it for love
(you know I'm in it for love baby)
(you know I am)
(just look inside your heart)

You're trying to play it cool
Keepin' me runnin' around
Don't think I'm gonna give it up
'Cause that ain't the way it's gonna go down

Every day, every night
All I do is sit and think about you
It goes on endlessly
There's no way I can't deny
Everything I feel inside
I want to show you
I need to hold you
'Cause words are not enough

You know I'm here to stay
I'm not gonna walk away
I wanna be in your life all of the time
Nobody else will do
That's why I'm in it for you
And I swear I'm in it for love
