Stealing the blades from the old gods' grave
Thunder & firestorm
Tempting the wrath from the giant's path
Grip on the battle axe
My war has come to you
Usurp my throne & I'll sink my teeth in

Electric messiah
Thunder & fire
Electric messiah
Thunder & fire

Pack of hell from the devil's well
We take a drink or two
Sever the wrist & the blood is fixed
Worship the followless
My war has come to you
Usurp my throne & I'll sink my teeth in

Electric messiah
Thunder & fire
Electric messiah
Thunder & fire

All give praise as the ace hits the stage
All are amazed at the cards that he played
My homage paid to the king in his grave
He's playing bass & he's melting your face

All give praise as the ace hits the stage
All are amazed at the cards that he played
