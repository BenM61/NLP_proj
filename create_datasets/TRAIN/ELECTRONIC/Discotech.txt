Stepping out tonight, flying so high
It's the good times keeping me alive
Are you ready to hit it running?
This is where it's at six in the morning

(Bridge)
You can fake this only if you take this 
(You wanna lose control, you wanna lose control)
(You wanna lose control, you wanna lose control)
The way she does it, I can't get enough
The way she does it, I can't get enough

Attack, we keep it on the dance floor
Discotech, meet me at the back door
Let's get down; we've been waiting a long time
She's back; I can feel it in the air
Discotech, you know she's going to be there
Let's get down; we've been waiting a long time

Show up in the crowd, take a look around
Me and my crew - we came to get down
She's giving me looks; I can't help it
The way I'm feeling; it's going to happen

(Bridge)

Attack, we keep it on the dance floor
Discotech, meet me at the back door
Let's get down; we've been waiting a long time
She's back; I can feel it in the air
Discotech, you know she's going to be there
Let's get down; we've been waiting a long time

You make fast living, look just fine
Looks like I got here just in time
Tonight the city is yours and mine
But it won't last forever

Attack, we keep it on the dance floor
Discotech, meet me at the back door
Let's get down; we've been waiting a long time
She's back; I can feel it in the air
Discotech, you know she's going to be there
Let's get down; we've been waiting a long time
