Well I'm rollin' and a tumblin' I've cried the whole night long
Oh well I'm rollin' and a tumblin' I've cried the whole night long
Oh well I hurt your feelin' baby, so this gone all wrong

Oh well I really love you baby, come on and say you'll be mine
Oh well I really love you baby, come on and say you'll be mine
Well if you don't like my tattoo's??? don't you drink my wine

Oh well I cried as my momma have cried the night before
Oh well I cried as my momma have cried the night before
Oh well I hurt your feelin' baby, you don't love me no more

Well in the river was whiskey I wasn't drive and drunk
Well in the river was whiskey I wasn't drive and drunk
Well I was whipped to the bottom baby I wouldn't come up

Oh well I'm rollin' and a tumblin' I've cried the whole night long
Oh well I'm rollin' and a tumblin' I've cried the whole night long
Oh well I hurt your feelin' baby, so this gone all wrong
