Carbon monoxide
Soon I'll go to sleep
If I don't got my socks on right
They slide right off of my feet
As I walk walk walk walk walk walk

Walk walk walk walk walk walk
Carbon monoxide
As I take you home
First time I get my socks on right
But I don't have a gas mask on
As I walk walk walk walk walk walk
You home
Yeah

I'm so cool
I'm so cool
I'm so cool

Walk walk walk walk walk walk
You home

I'm so cool 
I'm so cool
I'm so cool

Come on daddy
Come on daddy
Come on daddy
Come on daddy 
Come on daddy
Come on daddy

Carbon monoxide
Soon we'll go to sleep
