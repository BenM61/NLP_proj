I got a call. A telephone call today.
Somebody's offering a job a thousand miles away,
And I want to take it, its the opportunity of a life time,
But I need a second opinion, an opinion other than mine.

So I, I'm turning to you,
Because you always seem to know what to do.
When times like these arrive, I call,
On my only true friend in the world, my girl.

So I, I want to know,
Should I really, really go,
And if so, are you coming with me?
I, I got to know,
If you really want me to go,
And if so, come with me.

I never wanted anything as much as I want you with me.
You were the one who said to follow my dreams,
Of having a house, a car, a view of the stars, and a beautiful wife,
So I need someone I can go with,
I need some love in my life.

So I, I'm turning to you,
Because you always seem to know what to do.
When times like these arrive, I call,
On the only real love of my life, you are my life.

I want to know,
Should I really, really go,
And if so, are you coming with me?
So I, I got to know,
If you really want me to go,
And if so, come with me.

I need you to come with me
