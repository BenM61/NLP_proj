Who said 
Broken pieces don't mend 
I say 
I say to think again 

You may 
Take advice from all your friends 
But I say 
That I'm living in your head 

Just let it grow 
Let it grow inside of you 
Let it grow 
Let it flow inside of you 
Let it grow let it grow let it grow 

She said that its easy for men 
And I said that we all feel the rain 
Then she said 
Move a little closer then 
Who says that broken pieces don't mend 

Just let it grow 
Let it grow inside of you 
Let it grow 
Let it flow inside of you 
Let it grow let it grow let it grow 

'cause in the garden of reason 
You can't change what you're given 
But you can go where the river flows 

let it grow grow grow grow 
Let it grow grow grow grow 

yeah yeah yeah let it grow 

yeah 
Let it grow 

life gives you a hand 
You play by the rules 
You'll never come through 

life gives you a hand 
You play by the rules 
You'll never come through 

('cause in the garden of reason 
You can't change what you're given)
