I'm on the road to freedom
On the road to love
Yonder can you see them
Who they're thinking of

I met a rich man on the road
He told me where to go
To get my hands upon some gold
But I still answered no
'Cause freedom waits for me ahead
Your gold will slow me down
I smiled as I walked on my way
And left him with a frown

I met an old man on the road
His eyes were clear and wise
Can you direct me on my way
To where the answer lies
I'm looking for the road to freedom
So I can be free
He said keep thinking as you walk
And one day you will see

I'm on the road to freedom
On the road to truth
Yonder can you see them
Wasting precious youth

I thought as I walked down the road
Of what the man had said
It seems to me that what he meant
Is freedom's in your head
The road I walk along is time
It's measured out in hours
And now I need not rush along
I stop to see the flowers
Stop to smell the flowers
