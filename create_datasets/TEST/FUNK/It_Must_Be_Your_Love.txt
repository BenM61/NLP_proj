It must be your love
Or no love at all
It must be your arms, baby
Or no hug at all
I find myself waiting 
Each night for your call

Now, people say
Go on, girl, find someone new
But they just don't know
What I've found in you
It must be your love
Or no love at all

It must be your kiss
Or no kiss at all
It's got to be your touch, baby
That I love so much
But without your tender love and care
I'm surely gonna fall now

And they keep on tryin' to tell me
To find someone else, girl
But, oh, they just don't know
What I've found in you
It must be your love, yeah
Or no love at all

I wouldn't think of living
Oh I wouldn't think of making it
Without you
I don't care what the people say
Oh, you got to, you got to feel
The same way too
I'm gonna do all the things
I told ya, yeah
Promise each day, each day
To be true

It got to be your love
Got to, got to be your love
Got to be your love
No other love will do
I ain't takin' no other love
I don't want
I not gonna have any love
But your love
Got to be
