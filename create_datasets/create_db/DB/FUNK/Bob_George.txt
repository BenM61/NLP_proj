New coat, huh?
That's nice
Did you buy it?
Yeah, right
You seeing that bitch motherfucker again
You know who I'm talking about
That slicked back paddy with all the gold in his mouth
Don't try to play me for yesterday's fool
'Cause I'll slap your ass into the middle of next week
I'm sorry baby, that's the rules

I pay the rent in this raggedy motherfucker
And all you do is suck up food and heat
Say what, oh yeah?
For someone who can't stand no T.V. dinners
You sure eat enough of them motherfuckers
Who bought you that diamond ring?
Yeah, right
Since when did you have a job?
You seeing that rich motherfucker again
What's his name? Bob?
Bob, ain't that a bitch?
What's he do for a living?
Manage rock stars?
Who?
Prince, ain't that a bitch?
That skinny motherfucker with the high voice?
Please, who do I look like baby?
Yesterday's fool?
Don't you know I will kill you now?
You're fuckin' right, I gotta gun
You think I don't?
Then what's this?
Oh, you quiet now, uh-uh
Little?
Yeah, right
It might be little but it's loud

Yeah, right
Uh-uh

Now put that suitcase down
And go in there 
And put on that wig I bought you
No, no, no, no
The reddish-brown one
Bob, ain't that a bitch?
Oh
Gotcha 
Got ya

Hey Bob, if you're out there, let me see you dance
You said you was funky
C'mon
C'mon

Ain't that a bitch?
Bob

(Come out with your hands up)
I'll kick your ass (This is your last warning)
Think I won't?
(Oh no, the n*gger's got a laser)
(Let's get the hell out of here)

Is Mr. George home?
Hello, Mr. George? 
This is your conscience, motherfucker
Why don't you leave motherfuckers alone, what's wrong with you?
Well, why can't we just dance, why can't we just dance?
No, f*ck that, f*ck that
I don't talk about you, I don't talk about you
Wit' yo' little almond-shaped head ass
Who the f*ck do you think this is?
I'll kick your ass, twice

Bob, if you're out there
Let me see you dance
You said you were funky

C'mon
B-O-B, spell the shit backwards, what'd it say
Same motherfuckin' shit

Turn it out 

Bob, ain't that a bitch?
