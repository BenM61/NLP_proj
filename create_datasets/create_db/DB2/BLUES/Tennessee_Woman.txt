Got a pretty woman, lives way down in Tennessee
Well, I've got a pretty woman lives way down in Tennessee
Well, I'm crazy 'bout my baby
She's the only one for me

Well, I want to see you, baby, I don't have my train fare
Yes, I want to see you, baby, I don't have my train fare
I'm gonna take out all my money
I'm gonna ride on away from here

Well, my mind begins to ramble and my heart is full of pain
Yes, my mind begins to ramble and my heart is full of pain
Time I think of my baby
My tears fall like showered pain

I've got a pretty woman, lives way down in Tennessee
Yes, I got a pretty woman, lives way down in Tennessee
Well, I'm crazy 'bout my baby
She's the only one for me
