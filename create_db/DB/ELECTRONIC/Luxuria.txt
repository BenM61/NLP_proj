We sleep in the city of dreams
We have settled under the dust
We take forty thousand winks
On the threshold of
Unanswerable lust

God's gone back to heaven
He's deserted us
But what the hell
He never understood us anyway

Have our souls pined away?
Have we sowed our seed in vain?
Has he set his face against us
And now shall we be slain?
This is the Stone Age of our desire
These are our formative years
Don't let them say the devil
Slaked his raging thirst
On our filthy tears

God's gone back to heaven
He's deserted us
But what the hell
He never understood us anyway

We simply may be evil
I don't care if it's true
We simply may be evil
I don't care if it's true
I'm going to try anything, try anything
Because I really want you
I've got to have everything, have everything
Because I really really need to

God's gone back to heaven
He's deserted us
But what the hell
He never understood us anyway
