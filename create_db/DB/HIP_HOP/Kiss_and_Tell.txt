Hey, oh oh, tell me

[Chorus]
Tell me if you kiss and tell
If you will that just won't do
I got something for your body
Stays between me and you

I never had a real lover
'Cause all the guys I dated
Were too immature
I need your help to discover
All the love inside for you

I gave you my love and my life
My time, my everything
Tell me what you wanna do
What's on your mind

'Cause baby, you know you're really driving me crazy
You know I wanna be your lady
Although you wanna act so shady, yeah

Darling, don't you know you hear me calling?
Catch me 'cause I'm falling in love with you
So tell me

[Chorus: x2]

You may think that I'm not ready
To give you what a woman should
But as long as it stays between us baby
Never let our secret loose

I give my love, my heart
My time, my everything
Tell me what you wanna do
Now, baby it's up to you

'Cause baby you know you're really driving me crazy
You know I wanna be your lady
Although you wanna act so shady, baby

Darling, don't you know you hear me calling?
Catch me 'cause I'm falling in love with you
Oh, tell me

[Chorus: x3]
