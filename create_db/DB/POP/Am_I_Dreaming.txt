See I met him on the beach
In the summer it was hot
We were chilling in the island breeze
Then he whispered in my ear
Mami come on over here
Let me take you to your fantasy
Should I stay or should I go
'cause I've been here before
Should I even up the flow
Get back & let it go
'cause in my head I didn't think
That I can fall in love with you

[Chorus]
And when we kissed under the moon
Am I dreaming
He showed me things I never knew
Am I dreaming
He know exactly what to do
Am I dreaming
Am I dreaming
Am I
Am I dreaming
Am I dreaming

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Got my heart up in this dance
What a beautiful man
That batchata as we rock on the set
Put his hand over my hips
Started looking at his lips
I'm the luckiest girl in the land
And I can't believe the way you
Got me feeling right

I don't wanna leave this place
Stay right by my side
But in my head I never thought
I could fall in love with you.

[Chorus]

Baby wish we never left the floor, I don't know
Don't wanna be alone anymore
We have something measured out, I don't know
Are you real, am I dreaming.

Oh eh, oh eh, oh eh oh, oh eh oh eh, oh ah
Oh eh, oh eh, oh eh oh, oh eh oh eh, oh ah

[Chorus]

Oh eh, oh eh, oh eh oh, oh eh oh eh, oh ah
Oh eh, oh eh, oh eh oh, oh eh oh eh, oh ah
