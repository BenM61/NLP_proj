Another night and it seems that 
You made you cry yourself to sleep
Reminiscing on how it began
You found pleasure in this man
You fell like you'll never leave
For his life now you want to lead

Give me just one chance 
Cause I can believe that I can make you smile
I know a thousand times
You sit alone and cry
You don't deserve it
Cause I can believe that I can make you smile

Tranquility the misery 
Any day will it ever cease?
Here's my shoulder it's okay to cry
Cause I know how make it right
Cause you feel like you want to leave
For his life now you won't lead
Baby give me one chance

Cause I can believe that I can make you smile
I know a thousand times
You sat alone and cry
You don't deserve it 
Cause I can believe that I can make you smile

Whoa
I never never make you cry
So pretty baby dry your eyes
I never never make you cry
I promise baby your to precious
I never never make you cry
So pretty baby dry your eyes
I never never make you cry

Cause I believe that I can make you smile
I know a thousand times
You sat alone and cry
You don't deserve it 
I believe that I can make you smile
I know a thousand times
You sat alone and cry
Girl you don't deserve it

I believe that I can make you smile
I never never make you cry
So pretty baby dry your eyes
I never never make you cry
So pretty baby dry your eyes
For ever and ever oh yeah I believe
Oh yeah I believe that
