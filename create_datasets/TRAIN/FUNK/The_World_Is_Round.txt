The world is round
But it's crooked just the same, yeah, yeah
I know the world is round
But it's crooked just the same, yeah, yeah

And you'll never, never know
Just what man there is to blame, yeah, yeah

Wait a minute
I want to tell you something

Cause there's the teacher
The preacher, gamblin' man
Dark side will make it
On a easy plan

Lawyer, doctor
Even town breaker
I'm tryin' to keep up
With the undertaker

Chauffeur's runnin' around
With them still knockin' for girls
Drummer in the band
Been this way to the world

We just end up pooping
Jumpin' up and down
Sisters in the corner
I'm Alabama bound

The world is round, round, round, round
But it's crooked just the same, yeah, yeah
And you never, never know
Just what man there is to blame, no, no

I know, you know, they know
That the world is round
I know you know, everybody know
That the world is round
The world is round, oh, yeah
The world is round
