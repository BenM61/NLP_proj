I had a dream last night
That I was piloting a plane
And all the passengers were drunk and insane
I crash landed in a Louisiana swamp
Shot up a horde of zombies
But I come out on top
What's it all about?
Guess it just reflects my mood
Sitting in the dirt
Feeling kind of hurt

When all I hear is doom and gloom
And all is darkness in my room
Through the light your face I see
Baby take a chance
Baby won't you dance with me

Lost all that treasure in an overseas war
It just goes to show you, don't get what you paid for
Battle to the rich and you worry about the poor
Put my feet up on the couch
And lock all the doors
What's that funky noise
Guess that's the tightening of the screws
Sitting in the dirt
I'm feeling kind of hurt

All I hear is doom and gloom
But when those drums go boom boom boom
And through the night your face I see
Baby take a chance
Baby won't you dance with me
Yeah
Baby won't you dance with me
Ah yeah

Fracking deep for oil
But there's nothing in the sump
There's kids all picking
Ar the garbage dumb
I'm running out of water
So I better prime the pump
I'm trying to stay sober
But I end up drunk

We'll be eating dirt
Living on the side of the road
There's some food for thought
Kinda makes your head explode
Feeling kind of hurt
Yeah

But all I hear is doom and gloom
And all is darkness in my room
Through the night your face I see
Baby take your chance
Won't you dance with me
Yeah, come on
Baby won't you dance with me

I'm feeling kind of hurt
Baby won't you dance with me
Oh yeah
I'm sitting in the dirt
Baby won't you dance with me!
