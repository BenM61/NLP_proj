A bird is born to fly, born for the moment, it takes to the sky
And all its dreams are riding on its wings
But if it falls, the dreams aren't broken
As long as the wind is fair, the sky is always there

Oh, the girl who used to be me, she could fly, she was free
You could read by the light of her smile
Yes, the girl who used to be me used to go dancing
She's been gone such a long, long while

She left without a sound, nobody noticed she wasn't around
And only the moon remembers her at all
The days go by, you start asking questions
And wondering why, why did the dreams all go?
I guess it's time to know

Oh, the girl who used to be me, she could fly, she was free
And she wrote all the words to her song
Yes, this girl who used to be me, used to go dancing
And I feel she's been gone too long
I'd like the chance to be the girl who used to be me, oh
The girl
