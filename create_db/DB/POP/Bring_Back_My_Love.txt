When I was young
Love was a lonely lullaby
Then there was you
I saw my future in your eyes
And I threw you away
I was wrong
When all is said and done

And I'm
Gonna to bring back my love to you
Gonna show you what love can do
Believe me
Just give me time
Cause I'm
Gonna bring back my love to you
And we'll lay down like lovers do
Oh my darlin'
Say you'll be mine

Spending my time building my castles in the sand
I was a fool letting you fall right through my hands tonight
Please let me hold you in my arms
And lie here safe from harm

Cause I'm gonna bring back my love to you
Gonna show you what love can do
Oh my darlin'
Say you'll be mine

All that I ever wanted
All that I ever needed
Was your love
Cause your love
Carries me

Cause I'm
Gonna bring back my love to you
Gonna show you what love can do
Oh believe me
Just give me time
Cause I'm
Gonna bring back my love to you
And we'll lay down like lovers do
Oh my darlin'
Say you'll be mine

Oh my darlin'
Say you'll be mine
