I'm a little shy, but I know you know
I've done this too much 'cause I been alone
I'm feeling this devotion, touching your emotion
I can see the love run right out of you
Moments like these are golden
Never felt so open
Even if I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming with you

So breathe my air, and kiss me there
'Cause I'm a little cold but I'll warm up with you
Out of my chest when you put it there
Yeah I'm a little cold but I've warmed up with you
Woo oh ah ha ha ha yeah
Woo oh ah ha ha ha yeah
Woo oh ah ha ha ha yeah
Woo oh ah ha ha ha yeah

I don't care too much for valentines
I just need your skin next to mine
I'm feeling this devotion, touching your emotion
I can see the love run right out of you
Moments like these are golden
Never felt so open
Even if I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming with you

So breathe my air, and kiss me there
'Cause I'm a little cold but I'll warm up with you
Out of my chest when you put it there
Yeah I'm a little cold but I've warmed up with you
Woo oh ah ha ha ha yeah
Woo oh ah ha ha ha yeah
Woo oh ah ha ha ha yeah
Woo oh ah ha ha ha yeah
Woo oh ah ha ha ha yeah
Woo oh ah ha ha ha yeah
