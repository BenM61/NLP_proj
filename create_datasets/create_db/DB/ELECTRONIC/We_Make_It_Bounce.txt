Me love when you roll it, oh ma ma ma ma
So make me control it, oh na na na na
When she a back it up and a look pon me
And a eye contact me a pray
Move up ya body, ay gal

When you make it bounce, bounce, bounce
Gal make it bounce, bounce, bounce
While you make it bounce, bounce, bounce
Me say gal make it bounce, bounce, bounce

When you make it bounce, bounce, bounce
Gal make it bounce, bounce, bounce
While you make it bounce, bounce, bounce
Me say gal make it bounce, bounce, bounce

We make it bounce

Me love when you roll it, oh ma ma ma ma

Move up ya body, ay gal

When you make it bounce, bounce, bounce
Gal make it bounce, bounce, bounce
While you make it bounce, bounce, bounce
Me say gal make it bounce, bounce, bounce

When you make it bounce, bounce, bounce
Gal make it bounce, bounce, bounce
While you make it bounce, bounce, bounce
Me say gal make it bounce, bounce, bounce

Make it bounce up, make it bounce up, make it bounce up
We make it bounce
