It's all dark,
The streets are empty,
Take me home,
Here radio friendly.
Keep me out,
Take me under,
The water bridge,
Like when we were younger.

Here again,
I get nervous,
Think of leaving,
To know the ending.
There you are,
That's my doubt,
You're electric,
I'm a powerout.

Don't know who I am,
But I'll be with you,
Alive

Don't know who I am,
But I'll be with you,
Alive

I don't want to go,
There's nothing but rumour,
About what I might have never been.
You don't have to come,
See that if I,
You can stay,
Leave it behind.
Leave it behind.
Leave it behind.

Don't know who I am,
But I'll be with you,
Alive

Don't know who I am,
But I'll be with you,
Alive

You don't have to give,
It's nothing to me.
Cross your arms,
Keep everything.
There's another side to this sad story.
F*ck you Hollywood,
I'm the glory,
I'm the glory,
I'm the glory.
Yes, the one
I'm the glorious one.

Don't know who I am,
But I'll be with you,
Alive

Don't know who I am,
But I'll be with you,
Alive

Don't know who you are,
Or where you are,
Beside me.

Don't know who you are,
Or where you are,
Beside me.
