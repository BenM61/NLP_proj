Go down Moses
Way down in Egypt land
Tell all pharaoes to
Let my people go!

When Israel was in Egypt land
Let my people go!

Oppressed so hard they could not stand
Let my people go!

So the God said: go down, Moses
Way down in Egypt land
Tell all pharaoes to
Let my people go!

So moses went to Egypt land
Let my people go!

He made all pharaoes understand
Let my people go!
Yes the lord said: go down, Moses
Way down in Egypt land
Tell all pharaoes to
Let my people go!

Thus spoke the lord, bold Moses said:
-let my people go!
if not I'll smite, your firstborn's dead
-let my people go!

God-the lord said : go down, Moses
Way down in Egypt land
Tell all pharaoes to
Let my people go!

Tell all pharaoes
To let my people go
