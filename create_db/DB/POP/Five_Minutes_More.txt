Dear, this evening seemed to go so awfully fast
We had so much fun and now you're home at last
I look forward to a kiss or two at the garden gate
But she gave me just one peck and insisted it was late

Give me five minutes more, only five minutes more
Let me stay, let me stay in your arms
Here am I, begging for only five minutes more
Only five minutes more of your charms

All week long I dreamed about our Saturday date
Don't you know that Sunday morning you can sleep late?

Give me five minutes more, only five minutes more
Let me stay, let me stay in your arms

All week long I dreamed about our Saturday date
Don't you know that Sunday morning you can sleep late?

Give me five minutes more, only five minutes more
Let me stay, let me stay in your arms, ah, come on
