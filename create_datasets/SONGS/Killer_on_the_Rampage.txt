You left me with a problem
Now I know what it's all about
You took my heart and split it up
Now you know what it's all about

How do you feel my love?
Do you feel it as I walk away?
How do you feel my love?
Do you feel it as I walk away?

Who knows what kind of pity for
Excuse you from yourself
To justify the misery
That you put yourself within

How do you feel my love?
(Ay? My?)
Do you feel it as I walk away?
How do you feel my love?
Do you feel it as I walk away?

Need to find myself all that I've got left
Used up, ooh, I'm used up
Need to cry but still got to show my will
Been used too much

How do you feel my love?
Oh, child, do you feel it as I walk away?
How do you feel my love?
Oh, oh, oh, child, do you feel it as I walk away?

Need to find myself all that I've got left
Used up, ooh, I'm used up
Need to cry but still got to show my will
I've been used too much

How do you feel my love?
Do you feel it as I walk away?
How do you feel my love?
Do you feel it as I walk away?

How do you feel my love?
Do you feel it as I walk away?
How do you feel my love?
Do you feel it as I walk away?
