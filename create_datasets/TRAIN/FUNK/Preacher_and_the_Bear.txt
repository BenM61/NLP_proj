A preacher, he went huntin'
It was on a Sunday morn'
Of course it was against his religion
He took his gun along

Shot some very fine quail
One little measly hare
On his way returning home
He met a great big grizzly bear

Bear walked around, stood on the ground
He walked straight to the preacher, you see
Preacher got so excited
And then he ran up a Sycamore tree

Bear walked around, stood on the ground
The preacher crawled out on a limb
Cast his eye to the Lord above
And these are words he said to Him

He said, "Oh Lord, oh, Lord, Lord
You delivered Daniel in the lion's den
Samson strong and the hundred men
Hebrew children in the furnace of fire"

"David went to kill the lion
The good book do declare
But Lord, if they don't help me
Don't You help this big black bear"

The preacher stayed up in that tree
I think it was all night
Said, "Oh Lord, if You don't help me
Treat us both alright"

Just about that time the limb let go
The preacher come tumblin' down
You should've seen him getting that razor out
Before he struck the ground

He struck the ground cuttin' left and right
He put up a very good fight
About that time the bear told the preacher
Just hold him a little too tight

Preacher lost the razor
Bear held on with the (Incomprehensible)
Cast his eye to the Lord above
Once more prayed to Him

He said, "Oh Lord, oh Lord
Oh Lord, oh, oh, oh Lord
You remember Daniel in the lion's den
Samson strong and the hundred men
Hebrew children in the furnace of fire"

"David went to kill old lion
The good book do declare
Oh, oh, oh Lord
If You, if You, if You don't help me
Put a muscle on this big black bear"

Boy, boy, the preacher
The preacher and the bear
Boy, boy, the preacher
The preacher and the bear

Boy, boy, the preacher
The preacher and the bear
Boy, boy, the preacher
The preacher and the bear

Boy, boy, the preacher
The preacher and the bear
