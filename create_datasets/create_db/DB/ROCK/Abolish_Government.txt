Abolish government
There's nothing to it
Forget about God
He's no innocent
We live by a system
Of perfect goals
People vs. people who are bored and old

Life must rest on the man who represents

Looking for nothing in this
Campus with just friends
President the name
President the label
The highest man on the government table

Superficial love only for a f*ck
But love is incest and it's only for a f*ck
To the guys provided free
Peace time war time country's in vein

All die for this land some over seas
I live for the summons serve my country
Army, Navy, Air Force or jail
To the guys provided for free
Peace time war time country's in vein

But that's the American way what it is to be free
If that's what they call freedom it's not for me

Suck my motherfuckin' dick
