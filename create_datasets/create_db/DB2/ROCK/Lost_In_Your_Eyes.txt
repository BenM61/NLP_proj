Light from a window 
Cold dark and black 
Sound from a dream 
I was hypnotized 
I was paralyzed 
I could hardly speak 

And baby 
Baby 
You never realized 
That 
I could have stood there lost in your eyes 
Stood there waiting 
And not realized 
Love isn't easy 
It isn't always kind 
I could have stood there 
Lost in your eyes 

Guess I understand it 
Guess I sort of have to 
Guess I kind of see 
Just because it could have been 
Doesn't mean it had to 
Ever mean a thing 

And baby 
Baby 
I could say it all the time 
That 
I could have stood there lost in your eyes 
Stood there waiting 
And not realized 
Love isn't easy 
It isn't always kind 
I could have stood there 
Lost in your eyes 

And you know sometimes I wonder 
Yes I wonder 
I really really do 
Ya yes I do 
Just because it helps me 
Though sometimes it scares me 
Guess you wouldn't know 
No you wouldn't know 

Guess I understand it 
Guess I sort of have to 
Guess I kind of see 
Just because it could have been 
Doesn't mean it had to 
Ever mean a thing 

And baby 
Baby 
You never realized 
I could have stood there lost in your eyes 
Stood there waiting 
And never realized 
Love isn't easy 
It isn't always kind 
I could have stood there 
Lost in your eyes 
You know 
I could have stood there 
Ya ya ya ya 

Lost in your eyes 
Lost in your eyes 
Lost in your eyes 
Lost in your eyes 
Lost in your eyes 
Lost in your eyes 
Lost in your eyes
