I'm going down. My nose is in the sand 
I'm going down, down, baby. My nose is in the sand 
A cloud of dust just came over me and I think I'm drowning on dry land. 
You know, my father told me, son don't rush to be a man 
You know, my father told me, son don't you rush to be a man 
But I went ahead on, and now I think I'm drowning on dry land 
You know my mother told me the story, about that li'l dog that couldn't see too well 
He was crossing a railroad track one day, when the train cut off a part of his tail 
He turned around but never looked up, just to peep over the rail 
And she said he lost his whole head, trying to find a little piece of tail 
That's why I'm going down, my nose is in the sand 
A could of dust just came over me 
And now I think I'm drowning on dry land
