Even if I
Could see into your mind
Even if I
Tried to see
I'd still never really know
If you cared
You didn't hear a word
That I said

Cause I told you too many times
It's the little things that count which can make someone feel special
I think you're always in two minds
And it's forever that way, I know what you're gonna say
I told you too many times
It's the little things that count which can make someone feel special
I think you're always in two minds
And it's forever that way, I know what you're gonna say

Two minds
Two minds

Even if I
Could see into your mind
Even if I
Tried to see
I'd still never really know
If you cared
You didn't hear a word
That I said

Cause I told you too many times
It's the little things that count which can make someone feel special
I think you're always in two minds
And it's forever that way, I know what you're gonna say
I told you too many times
It's the little things that count which can make someone feel special
I think you're always in two minds
And it's forever that way, I know what you're gonna say

Two minds
Two minds

I told you too many times
It's the little things that count which can make someone feel special
I think you're always in two minds
And it's forever that way, I know what you're gonna say
I told you too many times
It's the little things that count which can make someone feel special

Two minds
