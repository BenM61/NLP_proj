All aboard!
Mean old Frisco, take my babe away
Mean old Frisco, take my babe away
Well I'm hopin' and tusslin
She'd come back home some day

Well, that people
Just don't understand
One day people
Just don't understand
Well, now she gone away and left me
Left me for another man

Standin' there tremblin'
While the train goes 'round the bend
Standin' there tremblin'
While the train goes 'round the bend
Well, what've I started ain't no crime
Me without all, have no friends

Welcome there new love
Round all, tear'm down
Welcome there new love
Round all, tear'm down
Well, I worked hard all of my life
Now you're getting pushed around
