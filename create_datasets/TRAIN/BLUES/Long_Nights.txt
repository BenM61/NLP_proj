Yes the nights are so long, baby, and the days are so blue
Seems like everything has gone wrong
Baby 'cause I'm without you
I guess this is that awful feeling
Baby that feeling they call the blues
All by myself baby, yes I began to weep
Yes, and when I dry my eyes, baby
You know I still can't sleep
Yes, I guess this is the feeling
Baby the feeling they call the blues
Yes as I sit here in my dark room, woman
With the tears running down my face
Yes as I sit here in my dark room, woman
With the tears running down my face
Yes I can feel and I can see you, woman
I can see you all over the place
Yes, then I start walkin', woman
Start walkin' all over the floor
Yes, my heart is telling me, woman
Tellin' me you won't be here no more
Oh, I guess this is the feeling
Baby the feeling, the feeling they call the blues
