A boy found a dream upon a distant shore
A maid with a way of whispering "si senor."
Each night while guitars would softly play,
The tune seemed to dance 'round the words that he'd say:

Amapola, my pretty little poppy
You're like that lovely flower so sweet and heavenly,
Since I found you, my heart is wrapped around you
And loving you, it seems to beat a Rhapsody.

Amapola, the pretty little poppy
Must copy it's endearing charm from you.
Amapola, Amapola, how I long to hear you say "I love you."

The boy left his love upon a distant shore
And sailed from the one his arms were longing for.
He vowed he'd return one sunny day,
Once more to repeat what his heart had to say
