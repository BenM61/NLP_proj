What child is this, who laid to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with voices sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping?

This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring Him grace
The son, the babe of Mary

So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh
Come, peasant, king, to praise Him
The King of kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him

Raise, raise the Son on high
Let's sing and fill the earth and sky
Joy, joy for Christ is born
The babe, the son of Mary

What child is this, who laid to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with voices sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping?
