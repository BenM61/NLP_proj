I walked from my baby's Brixton flat
Into a riot
I thought of maybe turning back
Till things were quiet

When all the buildings to be burned
Had been burned
And all the cars to overturn
Were overturned

Outside the prison they were screen testing the free
Open auditions for closed circuit T.V
Your baby brother would be there outside the jail

Throwing bottles as the police sirens wailed
And a love song might not be suitable
But you look beautiful tonight

Death and disaster only make me love you more
The morning after the night that went before
When the brains of Brixton with conflicting points of views
Are outside The Ritz on the local TV news

A love song might not be suitable
But you look beautiful tonight
And if you feel the same way as I feel
Everything will be alright

I was thinking
Let's forget about the car
And do some late night drinking
In a late night drinking bar

It isn't far, well, it's my local anyway
I know the barman
And there's a small vocal P.A

Now the insurance man has left you with the news
That your third party fire and theft would be no use
And I know a love song isn't suitable or right
But you look beautiful, beautiful tonight

And if you feel the same was as I feel
Everything will be alright

Tonight, big brother is watching you
And I am watching too
I will watch over you
Like a thunderbolt out of the blue

Something told me it was true
God created me and you
And God created Brixton too

Hallelujah, praise the Lord
Tonight you can rest assured
The Father, Son, the Holy Ghost and I
Will love you more than most tonight
