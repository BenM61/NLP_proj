Mickey Mouse in Moscow pornos sold at Gum's
The Russians all go crazy, their government went punk
Gorbatchev wears DMs, Gromyko looks real MOSH
Instead the international Hymn Bob Marley and Peter Tosh

Forget old Marx and Lenin
Who cares about the old farts
Let's party at the Kremlin
And skank down in Gorki Park

Police are growing dreadlocks, the army's on vacation
The KGB smokes homegrown grass like the rest of the Soviet nation
Red Square full of Burger Kings, Komsmolski kids on dope
Gimme gimme vodka all the Russians sing abandon any hope

Forget old Marx and Lenin
Who cares about the old farts
Let's party at the Kremlin
And skank down in Gorki Park

Meanwhile back in the Western block Russian fashion's up to date
Join your local Brioska shop before it is too late
Throw away your trendy clothes get yourself a new gear
Furcoats, feltboots, furcaps, Perestroika is here

Forget old Marx and Lenin
Who cares about the old farts
Let's party at the Kremlin
And skank down in Gorki Park

Forget old Marx and Lenin
Who cares about the old farts
Let's party at the Kremlin
And skank down in Gorki Park
