She'll only come out at night
The lean and hungry type
Nothing is new, I've seen her here before
Watching and waiting

She's sitting with you but her eyes are on the door
So many have paid to see, what you think you're getting for free?
The woman is wild, a she-cat tamed by the purr of a Jaguar
Money's the matter, if you're in it for love you ain't gonna get too far

Oh, here she comes
Watch out boy she'll chew you up
Oh, here she comes
She's a man eater

Oh, here she comes
Watch out boy she'll chew you up
Oh, here she comes
She's a man eater

I wouldn't if I were you, I know what she can do
She's deadly man, and she could really rip your world apart
Mind over matter
The beauty is there but a beast is in the heart

Oh, here she comes
Watch out boy she'll chew you up
Oh, here she comes
She's a man eater
