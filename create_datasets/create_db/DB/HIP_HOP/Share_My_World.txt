Boy if you stay I'll always make sure
That you look to see a brighter day
Don't let our lovin' slip away
The things you do, they always make me feel
Like there's no one else but you
Promise you'll be true
Always

Share my world
Don't you leave
Promise I'll be here
Whenever you need me near
Share my world
Don't you leave
Promise I'll be here
So baby don't you have no fear

To be with you would be like paradise
Everything would be so nice (so nice), so right (so right)
The joy you bring to me makes me feel so
Good inside
It's so right (so right), so high
Just thinkin' about you
And my feelings I just can't hide

Share my world
Don't you leave
Promise I'll be here
Whenever you need me near
Share my world
Don't you leave
Promise I'll be here
So baby don't you have no fear

I don't know what I would do
(Would do)
Without you (you)
When I'm down and out
I think about
The good love you give to me
Oh, the love you give to me
I'm so happy
So share, share my world

Share my world
Don't you leave
Promise I'll be here
Whenever you need me near
Share my world
Don't you leave
Promise I'll be here
So baby don't you have no fear

Oh, la la la
Won't you share my world
Won't you share my world
Oh, la la la
Won't you share my world
Won't you share my world
