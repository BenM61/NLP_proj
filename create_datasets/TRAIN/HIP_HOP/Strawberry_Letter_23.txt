Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

Hello, my love, I heard a kiss from you
The red magic satin playing near, too
All through the morning rain, I gaze the sun doesn't shine
The rainbows and waterfalls run through my mind

In the garden, I see the west purple shower, bells and tea
Orange birds and river cousins dressed in green
Pretty music I hear, so happy and loud
Blue flowers echo from a cherry cloud

Feel sunshine sparkle pink and blue
The playgrounds will laugh
If you try to ask
Oh, is it cool? Is it cool?

If you arrive and don't see me, I'm going to be, be with my baby
I am free, flying in her arms, over the sea
Stained window, yellow candy screen
See speakers of kites, with velvet roses diggin' freedom flight

A present from you, Strawberry letter 22
The music plays, I sit in (Incomprehensible), for you

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

Aah aah aah
Aah aah aah

A present from you, Strawberry letter 22
The music plays, I sit in for a few

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
