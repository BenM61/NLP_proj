You have to do your best to come up to par, from straight off the
Production line like a car,
Till everything you put on is a put-on, and you don't know who's face
You're gazing upon
Could be anyone you're sending out there tonight, is it any wonder all of
The lights are too bright?
And you need temporary beauty, and pray to God that it doesn't rain
You need temporary beauty, even though it might be love in vain
The world is full of little people like you, they have to read a book to
Learn what to do
They hang around in second -hand[?] clothes, and every kind of pressure
Steps on their toes
Love doesn't fall out of a magazine, you mustn't always believe what you've seen
And you need temporary beauty, and pray to God that it doesn't rain
You need temporary beauty, even though it might be love in vain
Ah-ah temporary beauty, ah-ah temporary beauty, ah-ah temporary beauty
You might be the sweetest little girl in your heart,
But still the world [?] knows that and tears you apart
You think of the parties you'll never attend, you dream of someone who's
More than a friend
Love doesn't jump out of a magazine, you mustn't always believe what you've seen
And you need temporary beauty, and pray to God that it doesn't rain
You need temporary beauty, even though it might be love, even though it
Might be love,
Even though it might be love in vain
