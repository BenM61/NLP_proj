Been down, but I've come back brighter,
Sun hurts me, if I try to fight her,
I won't be sat here waiting,
I won't be sat here waiting,
I won't be sat here waiting for it,
So come and take me on.

Sometimes, the black hole's inside ya,
But if you can just lighten up yourself,
It will make you stronger,
I won't be sat here waiting,
I won't be sat here waiting,
I won't be sat here waiting for it,
So come and take me on.

Get up
I've been down, but I've come back brighter,
Sun hurts me, if I try to fight her,
I won't be sat here waiting, 
I won't be sat here waiting,
I won't be sat here waiting,
I won't be sat here waiting,
For you, so come and take me,
So come and take me on and on and on

I've been down
