Wish you were here
Me oh my countryman
Wish you were here

Wish you were here
Don't you know the stove is getting colder
And I miss you like hell
And I'm feeling blue

Wish you were here
Me oh my countryman
Wish you were here

Wish you were here
Don't you know the stove is getting colder
And I miss you like hell
And I'm feeling blue

I've got feelings for you babe
Do you still feel the same
From the first time I laid my eyes on you
I felt joy of livin'
I saw heaven in your eyes 
In your eyes

Wish you were here
Me oh my countryman
Wish you where here (I wish you were here)

Wish you were here
Don't you know the stove is getting colder
And I miss you like hell
And I'm feeling blue

I miss your laugh I miss, your smile, I miss 
Everything about you
Every second's like a minute
Every minute's like a day
When you're far away

Wish you were here
The stove is getting colder baby
I wish you were here
Wish you were here
A battlefield of love and fear
And I wish you were here

I've got feelings for you babe
From the first time I laid my eyes on you

Wish you were here
Me oh my countryman
Wish you where here (I wish you were here)

Wish you were here
Don't you know the stove is getting colder
And I miss you like hell
And I'm feeling blue
