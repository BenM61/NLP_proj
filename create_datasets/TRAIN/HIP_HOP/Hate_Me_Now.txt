Escobar season has returned... 
Its been a long time 
Been a long time comin' 
Looks like the death of me now 
But you know, there's no turning back now
This is what makes me
This is what I am

You can hate me now (QB) 
But I won't stop now (Real Niggas) 
Cause I can't stop now (Bravehearts) 
You can hate me now (C'mon) 
But I won't stop now 
'Cause I can't stop now 
You can hate me now 
You can hate me nooow 

Do it now, do it now
Do it now 

Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy 
Ice that I wear, clothes that I try 
Close your eyes, picture me rollin', 
Sixes, money foldin' 
Bitches honeys that swollen 
The riches, Nas get in ya 
Most critically acclaimed Pulitzer prize winner 
Best storyteller thug narrator my style's greater 
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters 
Commentators ring side try watchin' my paper 
Almost a decade quite impressive 
Most of the best is in the essence 
For this rap shit that I stand for 
Expanding more to the big screen 
Bill gates dreams 
But it seems you'd rather see me in jail 
With state dreams 
Want me off the scene fast 
But good things last 
Like your favorite M.C. still makin' some mean cash 
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque 
Back to the projects 
But you still want to hate, be my guest 
I suggest 

Do it now 
You can hate me now (QB) 
But I won't stop now (Real Niggas) 
Cause I can't stop now (Bravehearts) 
You can hate me now (C'mon) 
But I won't stop now 
'Cause I can't stop now 
You can hate me now 
You can hate me nooow 

Do it now, I told you do it now 

You want to hate me then hate me 
What can I do? 
But keep gettin' money 
Funny I was just like you 
I had to hustle hard never give up 
Until I made it 
Now why'all sayin' that's a clever nigga 
Nothing to play with 
Hate on me, I blew but I'm the same ol G 
People warn me, when you're on top there's envy 
Took my niggas out the hood but you doubt on us 
Sayin' we left the hood 
But can't get it out of us 
My bad, should I step out my shoes 
Give 'em to you? 
Here's my car and my house 
You can live in that too 
Criticize when I flow for the streets 
Hate my dress code 
Gucci this, Fendi that 
What you expect hoe 
Nickname esco 
Took this game to its threshold 
Best flow I bet the whole U.S. know 
Try to make it like you the realest 
But who the illest? 
Think we all know the answer to that 
Cause niggas feel this right 

Do it now 
You can hate me now (QB) 
But I won't stop now (Real Niggas) 
Cause I can't stop now (Bravehearts) 
You can hate me now (C'mon) 
But I won't stop now 
'Cause I can't stop now 
You can hate me now 
You can hate me nooow 
 
Its a thin line between paper and hate 
Friends and snakes, nine millis and thirty-eights 
Hell or the pearly gates 
I was destined to come 
Predicted, blame God, he blew breath in my lungs 
Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows 
Shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one 
Took a little time to claim my spot 
Chairman of the board until this game stop 
And I side with the Lord 
Ride for the cause 
While driving, niggas shot out my doors 
Plottin', I'm sure to catch me 
With they glocks to my jaw 
Try stickin' my up but I 
But I flipped on these ducks 
Instead of me 
Ambulances were picking them up 
Niggas fear what they don't understand 
Hate what they can't conquer 
Guess its just a theory of man 
Became a monster, atop of the world 
Never fallin'
I'm as real as they come 
From day one, forever ballin' 
See'mon 

You can hate me now (QB) 
But I won't stop now (Real Niggas) 
Cause I can't stop now (Bravehearts) 
You can hate me now (C'mon) 
But I won't stop now 
'Cause I can't stop now 
You can hate me now 
You can hate me nooow 

(Do it now, do it now) 
(do it now, do it now) 
(c'mon) 
(Hate me now, hate me now) 
(C'mon niggas, see'mon niggas) 
(do it now, get the shit over with) 
(it ain't gonna ever stop niggas)
