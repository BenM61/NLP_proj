"?Jacky? jigsaw pieces 
Tossed about the room 
I saw my grandma sweepin'
With her old straw broom 
But she didn't what she was doin'
She could hardly understand 
That she was really sweepin' up
Pieces of a man 

I saw my daddy greet the mailman 
And I heard the mailman say 
"now don't you take this letter to heart now Jimmy 
Cause they've laid off nine others today" 
But he didn't know what he was saying 
He could hardly understand 
That he was only talkin' to 
Pieces of a man 

I saw the thunder and heard the lightnin'! 
And felt the burden of his shame 
And for some unknown reason 
He never turned my way 

Pieces of that letter 
Were tossed about that room 
And now I hear the sound of sirens 
Come knifing through the gloom 
But they don't know what they are doing 
They could hardly understand 
That they're only arrestin'
Pieces of a man 

I saw him go to pieces 
I saw him go to pieces 
He was always such a good man 
He was always such a strong strong man 
Yeah, I saw him go to pieces 
I saw him go to pieces"
