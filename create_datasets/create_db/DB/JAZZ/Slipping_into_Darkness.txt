Slippin' into darkness
Take my mind beyond the dreams
I was slippin' into darkness
Take my mind beyond the dreams

Where I talk to my brother, oh, oh, oh
Who never said their name

Slippin' into darkness
When I heard my mother say
I was slippin' into darkness
When I heard my mother say
(Hey, what'd she say? What'd she say?)

You been slippin' into darkness, oh, oh, oh
Pretty soon you're gonna pay, oh, oh, oh, oh
