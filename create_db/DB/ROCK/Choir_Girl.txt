Looking like a choirgirl
Crying like a refugee
Looking like a choirgirl
Crying like a refugee

One nurse to hold her
One nurse to wheel her down
The corridors of heeling
And I've been trying
But she's crying like a refugee

Loves me like a sister
Loves me like an only child
Loves me like a sister
Loves me like an only child
She's my connection

I'll hold on
And never, never, never let her down
'Cause she's alone
And she loves me like an only child

Suffer little children
Send that little child to me
All day the doctor
Handles his responsibility

Looking like a choir girl
Crying like a refugee
Looking like a choir girl
Crying like a refugee

She's my connection
I'll hold on
And never, never, never let her down
Cause she's alone
And she's crying like a refugee
