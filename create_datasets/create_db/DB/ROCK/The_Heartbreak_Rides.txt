Just out of the woods and yelling down the mountain,
All I really wanted was to go downtown
And so we ride.
The heartbreak slides.

She led the modern sunset to your window,
Gestured with a plane Jane hand,
She said "Let's go"

"Allez!" she cried.
The heartbreak rides for free.

Yoa!
Yoa!
Yoa!
Yoa! 

California adds some casual bedlam,
Something in the basic swing of things led them to victimless crimes.
The heartbreak climbs.
Playing with your words, a girl and two headlights,
Blinders on the interstate, we want the good life.

"LA!" she cried.
The heartbreak rides for free

Yoa!
Yoa!
Yoa!
Yoa!
Yoa!
