I've got a pocketful of money 
Got my own car to drive around 
But since I lost your love, your precious, precious love 
Oh I'm the poorest boy, the poorest boy in town 

I still buy all the latest records 
But they make such a lonely sound 
'Cause darlin', you're not there to hear them anymore 
So I'm the poorest boy, the poorest boy in town 

Without your love I'm just a beggar 
Beggin' for your sweet sweet love again 
'Cause now I know that 
I really don't need any money 
Don't need a car to drive around 
Just tell me you still care & make a millionaire 
Out of the poorest boy in town 

(instrumental) 

Just tell me you still care & make a millionaire 
Out of the poorest boy in town 
Out of the poorest boy in town
