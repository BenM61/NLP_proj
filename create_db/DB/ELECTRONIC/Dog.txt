God, god
Get down
Can you make my love console myself
Could've broken with no-one else
I was so a fear, but I know that life was everything
Love was a one-time thing
But I only brought my hand to my knife when I sing
Love, make it dog-style

Come on baby
Come on baby
Come on baby

Love myself with a broken-hearted love
What I never saw what do I care?
You don't want a sick celebration love
Think about a broken time was soulless
And oh and I was fear and I was on my knees
You gonna tell me, would you break my love you're stealing my love

Come on baby
Come on baby
Come on baby
Love come on baby
Come on baby

Let me feel my gift to god grow
And I love one time when your life goes suck
And you did it with an open heart now
I feel it, I am awake 'till my only time
Wanna go down so you can wake up tired
I was holding my
And I was looking for something else, but I want love

Come on baby
Love come on baby
Come on baby
Come on baby

Oh f*ck it
I see it forever
When you waking, I'm going to break your love

Come on
Love come on baby
Come on baby
Love come on baby
Come on baby
Come on baby
Come on baby
Come on baby
You'll know it feels good
Come on baby
