Oh mother dear
I'm sad, and I'm blue
Everything I do
Remind me of you

Yes, I want you to know
That I need you so
You're on my mind
Everywhere I go

Yes, I dreamed last night
That you were near
And with my thoughts
I had no fear

Oh mother dear
I'm sad, and I'm blue
Everything I do
Remind me of you
