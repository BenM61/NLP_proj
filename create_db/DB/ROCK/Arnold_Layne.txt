Arnold Layne 
Had a strange hobby
Collecting clothes
Moonshine washing line
They suit him fine

On the wall 
Hung a tall mirror
Distorted view
See through baby blue
He done it, oh, Arnold Layne
It's not the same, 
It takes two to know
Two to know 
Two to know
Two to know
Why can't you see?

Arnold Layne 
Arnold Layne 
Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne

Now he's caught
A nasty sort of person
They gave him time
Doors bang, chain gang 
He hates it
Oh, Arnold Layne
It's not the same 
It takes two to know
Two to know 
Two to know
Two to know
Why can't you see?

Arnold Layne 
Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne

Arnold Layne, don't do it again
