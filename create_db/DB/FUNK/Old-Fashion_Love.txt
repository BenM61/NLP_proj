I'm in love with a plain old-fashion girl (love with a plain [?])
She's the most beautiful person in the world (ooh, yeah)

Her smile is so warm and her eyes burn so deep (deep, deep)
Softly in rhymes of love she sings to me
Love is for love but only if it's meant to be (only if it's meant to be, baby)

I'm in love with a plain and simple girl (I'm in love)
She takes my heart and sends me for a whirl
I'm on the wings of love and I don't take care where I go (honey, I'm so in love)
Because when we reach that star we both will know
Love is for love and our love was meant to be (our love was meant to be, baby)

I want some lovin' tonight
Some old-fashion love, baby I know that you do it right (do it, do it, do it to it, baby)

I want some lovin' tonight
Some old-fashion love, baby, I know that you do, do, right
Do it, do it, do it right, baby (I know you do it right)

I just love the way she makes love (I love it, I love it)
She gives me all she can as I feel its flow
Oh baby, her love is plain and simple and that's all right with me
Because it's so passionate girl, she makes me see
(Love is for love and this love was meant to be)

Ow, I want some love, baby, ow
Some old-fashioned love, baby, I know that you do it right (do it, do it, do it to it, baby)
I want some love, baby, tonight
(Some old-fashioned love, baby) I know that you do it (do it) do it right there
I want, gimme-gimme-gimme
I want some old-fashioned love, baby
I want some love, baby, tonight (do it, do it, do it)
Some old-fashioned love (I want, gimme-gimme-gimme)
I want some old-fashioned love, baby
(I want, gimme-gimme-gimme)
I want some old-fashioned love, baby
Do it, do it, do it, baby
I want, gimme-gimme-gimme
I want some old-fashioned love, baby
