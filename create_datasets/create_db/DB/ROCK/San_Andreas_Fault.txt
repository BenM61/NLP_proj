Go west 
Paradise is there 
You'll have all that you can eat 
Of milk and honey over there 

You'll be the brightest star 
The world has ever seen 
Sun-baked slender heroine 
Of film and magazine 

Go west 
Paradise is there 
You'll have all that you can eat 
Of milk and honey over there 

You'll be the brightest light 
The world has ever seen 
The dizzy height of a jet-set life 
You could never dream 

Your pale blue eyes 
Strawberry hair 
Lips so sweet 
Skin so fair 

Your future bright 
Beyond compare 
It's rags to riches 
Over there 

San Andreas Fault 
Moved it's fingers 
Through the ground 
Earth divided 
Plates collided 
Such an awful sound 

San Andreas Fault 
Moved its fingers 
Through the ground 
Terra cotta shattered 
And walls came 
Tumbling down 

O promised land 
O wicked ground 
Build a dream 
Tear it down 

O promised land 
What a wicked ground 
Build a dream 
Watch it fall down
