Last night I dreamed I was at a concert
So many people, you had to stand in line
One night only in Soul Heaven
I didn't wanna wake up
I was having such a good time
All of The Bar-Kays were tuning up on stage
Jimi had his guitar, gettin' ready to play
Sam was singing "A Change Gonna Come"
Otis was there, sittin' at the dock of the bay

There was a party in Soul Heaven
Superstars from the past
Standing room only, so you better hurry
Buy your ticket cause they're going fast

Train & Miles (J. Coltrane,  took mean solo
Jr. Walker had 'em dancing in the isles
They stood up when Jackie sang "Lonley Teardrops"
When Sammy (Davis, Jr.) danced, the crowd went wild
I think I saw Ella standing with Mahalia
Backstage with Elvis with his blue suede shoes
It started raining, everybody just stayed there
To hear Z.Z. sing the "Down Home Blues"

Well there's a party in Soul Heaven
Superstars from the past
Standing room only, so you better hurry
Buy your ticket cause they're going fast

There's a party in Soul Heaven
Superstars from the past
The great Al Jackson was a holding down the beat
When Marvin sang "Let's Get It On", they jumped to
their feet
Everyone started screaming and gave a standing ovation
When the curtain came up with the mighty Temptations
King Curtis blew the "Soul Serenade"
Thought I saw Lady Day (B. Holiday) sittin' in the
shade
I got two lovers and I ain't ashamed
Lord I love the way sweet Mary (Wells) sings
It was getting kinda late, it was time to go
Tupac and Biggie (Smalls), they closed the show
(Boo!)
I didn't wanna wake up, I was having such a good time
I didn't wanna wake up, I was having such a good time
Pearl Bailey, she was there
Duke and Count, they were there
Woah Hathaway (Donnie), I saw him there
Dizzie and Satchmo, I saw 'em there
It was a party in Soul Heaven
You shoulda been there
You shoulda been there
Everyone was having such a good time
Soul Heaven
