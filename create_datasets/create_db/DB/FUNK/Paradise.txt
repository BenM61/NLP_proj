I'd wash the sand off the shore
Give you the world if it was mine
Blow you right to my door
Feels fine

Feels like you're mine
Feels right, so fine
I'm yours, you're mine
Like paradise

I'd give you the world if it was mine
Feels fine

Feels like you're mine
I'm yours so fine
Like paradise

Like paradise

Wanna share my life with you
