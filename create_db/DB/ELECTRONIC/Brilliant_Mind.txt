I'm at the stage
Where everything I thought meant something, seems so unappealing
I'm ready for the real thing but nobody's selling none
Except you and you're saying opening up your eyes and ears, and lets me in

You must be out of your brilliant mind
You must be out of your brilliant mind

You're at the stage
You want your empty words heard and everybody's ready
I want to know your secrets but you're no telling
You're just gesturing saying open up your arms and hearts, and lets me in

You must be out of your brilliant mind
You must be out of your brilliant mind

And I'm at the stage
Where I want my words heard and no one wants to listen though
No one wants to listen 'cause everybody's yelling
About you and yours and how I'd have the answer if only I'd open up up up and let you in

They must be out of their brilliant minds
They must be out of their brilliant minds

I said shame, shame on you
Oh shay-ay-ame, shame on you you you you
Shay-ay-ame, Shame on you you you you you yeah

You must be out of your brilliant mind

And I'm at the stage
Where I want my words said and no one wants to listen
No one wants to listen 'cause everybody's yelling
About you and yours and how I'd have the answer if only I'd open up up up and let you in

They must be out of their brilliant minds
They must be out of their brilliant minds

And they must be ou-ou-ou-ou-out of their brilliant minds
Everyone ou-ou-ou-ou-out of their brilliant minds
Oh, I must be out, I must be out, of my brilliant mind
Oooh my brilliant mind
