Yo shoot 'em Biv 
Yeah Bell Biv Devoe bouncing across the Air Waves 
Shoot 'em 
Shoot 'em Rick 
Spiderman's in the house, shoot 'em 

No one even knows it 
Girl to me you just can't show it 
You know that I won't buy it 
Girl, there's no use to tryin' to hide it 
'Cause I girl you know I need it 
Behind the back girl I've seen it 
Take me as a joking prankster 
I can't believe my girlfriends a gangsta 

Not my baby 
I lost my trust in you 
Its really driving me crazy 
And I don't know what I'm gonna do 
I'm going outta my mind 
And if she keeps it up were through 
You take me as a prankster 
But baby I'm still in love with you 

'Cause she's a gangsta 
Gangsta boogie 
'Cause she's a gangsta 
Gangsta boogie 

It's obvious to see 
She's dressing better than me 
Driving a Benz and making money 
Don't even have the time to call me honey 
She carries a gun 
Just for fun 
One day well argue then shell shoot me girl I'm not 
The one 

Not my baby 
I lost my trust in you 
Its really driving me crazy 
And I don't know what I'm gonna do 
I'm going outta my mind 
And if she keeps it up were through 
You take me as a prankster 
But baby I'm still in love with you 

'Cause she's a gangsta 
Gangsta boogie 
'Cause she's a gangsta 
Gangsta boogie 

Here we go 
Yo Spiderman bring that beat back 
Here we go 
Be	 
Be	 
D 

She's a gangsta 
You know she would 
Try to hide it by looking good 
Roll behind you're back she could and stood a female 
Hood 
She's the pretty in pink that makes you think 
She wears gold, silk and even mink 
And if she catches you with another lover 
You're a dead mutha 

'Cause she's a gangsta 
Girl I lost my trust in you. 
I don't know what I'm gonna do 
'Cause she's a gangsta 
I'm still in love with you 
'Cause she's a gangsta 
She don't know that I know 
She's a gangsta, she's a gangsta
