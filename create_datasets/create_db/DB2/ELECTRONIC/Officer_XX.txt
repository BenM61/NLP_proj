Canteen culture colouring the view
From hendon to eltham, not following the clue
Corruption instruction, the life blood of the blue
The whole of the barrel is rotten and not just a few
Evidence buried with a secret handshake
Investigating officers on the double x take
Lost records and notes, excuses half baked
Screwed up afore and this is no mistake

Officer xx, it's time to liaise
Let me introduce you to the brand new krays
No mention of the gangster- 'informer' is the phrase
No communication in the 'in' and 'out' trays
Mi5, them building up combat 18? 
Nazi turnouts and the bnp in between? 
Running drugs for money for the loyalists? 
Macpherson, how come you missed the whole a this? 

Defective constable, what you gonna say? 
Suspending our belief and still on full pay
Chief condon is safe, what did you expect? 
Who's up next? 
Calling officer xx!

Spindoctors and editors engaged in a pact
Information leaked out to cover up the facts
Daily slackmail onto a nice little earner
While another thousand cases still on the back burner
Zero tolerance for jack the home sec
Running for cover 'cause him know we're after him neck
Him a huff and him a puff
Inna de name a de law
When it come to the guilty him a man of straw

This shameful spectacle we can see clearly
Conspiracy in practice
Now not in theory
Heard all of de report and looked over the whole a de text
Time to step forward now officer xx

Defective constable, what you gonna say? 
Suspending our belief and still on full pay
Chief condon is safe, what did you expect? 
Who's up next? 
Calling officer xx!
