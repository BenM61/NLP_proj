Here in a familiar place
We got our heads down
And we pretend it's cause the night is dark
And running out of space
For us to run around
But it's a dead end, and money's tight
And it's been a long time of this

Something is got to give
Everyone here is ready to go
It's been a hard year with nothing to show
From down this road
It's only on we go, on we go
Everyone here is ready to go
It's been a hard year, and I only know
From down this low
It's only up we go, up we go

Let's get on another flight
Maybe set out to sea
Kick it up and shake a fist at it
Cause death is harder to come by
Than it is to breathe
When you gotta make a break for it
'Cause it's been a long time of this

Something is got to give
Everyone here is ready to go
It's been a hard year with nothing to show
From down this road
It's only on we go, on we go
Everyone here is ready to go
It's been a hard year, and I only know
From down this low
It's only up we go, up we go

Nothing gives easy
Easy gives nothing
I'm just tryin' a keep
Income coming in
Dawn is bound to break
When the night is done
Always darker days before brighter ones

Everyone here is ready to go
It's been a hard year with nothing to show
From down this road
It's only on we go, on we go
Everyone here is ready to go
It's been a hard year, and I only know
From down this low
It's only up we go, up we go
