Think of all the things we've done and now
You've decided I'm not the one
A love like ours just can't go on
Run away baby have your fun but

I, I, I, I, don't want to hurt you I don't want to see you cry
I, I, I, I, just want to hold your love tonight
You owe me some kind of love

I don't want to see you sad I don't want you
Feeling down I only want you to say you love me and you need me
The way I love ya please believe me

I, I, I, I, don't want to hurt you I don't want to see you cry
I, I, I, I, just want to hold you love tonight
You owe me some kind of love
You owe me some kind of love
