Coffee cup 
Mabou Mines 
Shooting up the power lines 
I don't know what's on my mind 
Dreaming of a simpler time 

And if I should explode into gasping Mary 
Please take me home to where the cross is rose 

Coffee cup 
An open mind 
The weathermen are flying blind 
You seem to me the bleeding kind 
Just dreaming of a simpler time 

If I should explode into gasping Mary 
Please take me home to where the cross is rose
