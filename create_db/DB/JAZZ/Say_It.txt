Say it over and over again
Over and over again
Never stop saying you're mine
Say it ever and ever so sweet 
Ever and ever so sweet

Just like an old Valentine
When you say "I love you"
The same old "I love you"
They whisper in stories and plays 
You can change "I love you"
The same old "I love you"

To oh! Such a heavenly phrase
So say it softly and gently and then 
Over and over again
Never stop saying you're mine
