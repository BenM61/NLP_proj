Night school strutter just strutting around
He can't find work since the band left town
He can't get up 'cause he can't get down

Yeah, he's a heartbroken bopper

Honor roll student graduation day
Summa Cum Laude is a big okay
Car wash king is having beans today

And he's a heartbroken bopper
Oh, he's a heartbroken bopper

Rise from the gutters, there's too much has gone to waste
Rise with the others, there's too much is done in haste

He's a heartbroken bopper
Oh, he's a heartbroken bopper
Oh, you're strutting with a heartbroken bopper
Oh, you're moving with a heartbroken bopper
Oh, you're shucking, heartbroken bopper
Oh, you're dancing, heartbroken bopper
Oh, you're moving, heartbroken bopper
You're rocking with a heartbroken bopper
A-strutting and a-moving with a heartbroken bopper
Making it, heart broken bopper
You've seen better days, heart broken bopper
Seen better days, heartbroken bopper
