Hey you, don't you know who I think I am?

Big fish, small town
Romeo, turns your mother on
Take it off, t-t-take it off
Backseat, a Rolls Royce
Radio, I'm not here to talk about it
Turn it up, t-t-turn it up
Come on baby

Do you wanna?
Do-do you wanna feel primadonna like me tonight?
Do you wanna?
Oh, don't you wanna be a primadonna with me tonight?
Come on, bring it on
Don't you know it's all about me tonight?
So come on, try it on
Feel primadonna with me tonight

Ha ha ha

A champagne, a Charlie
Roll it up, stick it on the tab
Light em' up, li-li-light em' up
Your ball, my rules, a cigarette
Don't you know that you are mine?
Light it up, li-li-light it up
Right now
You're gonna do me right now

Do you wanna?
Do-do you wanna feel primadonna like me tonight?
Do you wanna?
Oh, don't you wanna be a primadonna with me tonight?
Come on, bring it on
Don't you know it's all about me tonight?
So come on, try it on
Feel primadonna with me tonight

Oh, I can feel it in my bones
You can be a primadonna
A primadonna like me

Do you wanna?
Do-do you wanna be a primadonna like me tonight? (Yeah)
Do you wanna?
Oh, don't you wanna be a primadonna with me tonight? (Don't you wanna?)
Come on, bring it on (Come on, bring it on)
Don't you know it's all about me tonight?
So come on, try it on (Come on, try it on)
So be a primadonna
Feel a primadonna
Be a primadonna like me tonight
