(Mike Pinder) As time goes by you will see That we're going to be free You and me, we'll touch the sky Can you see in your mind's eye That we are one We're all the same There, by your side, I will be And life is just a simple game When this crazy world is free When it finds out Exactly what we're meant to be Free from doubt That we are one We're all the same And life is just a simple game Thoughts of another day Flashing through my head Thinking how life could be All of the things that our great men have said What we are meant to be Be what we want to be What we deserve to be As time goes by, you will see That we're going to be free Can you see in your mind's eye You and me, we'll touch the sky We're all the same That we are one And life is just a simple game We're gonna be free Oohhh, gonna be free Gonna be free (Free, gonna be free, gonna be free, Oohhh) *************************************************************
