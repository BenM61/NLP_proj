There's a bar right across the street
He's got a need he just can't beat
Out on the floor, he shuffles his feet away
He'll get the girl 'cause he looks so fine
He's gonna win her every time
He knows he will, he's dressed to kill
He's a night owl

Move on
There's a heart of a night owl callin'
To belong
She's cryin' in the night
Be strong
And find the heart of the night owl fallin'
Stay up till dawn
Until the night is gone

What will become of the restless kind
Where do they go when they've done their time
Wearin' their hearts out on the line
For all to see
Must be the gypsy in their soul
They have a need to rock and roll
They always will
They're out there still 
They're the night owls

Move on
There's a heart of a night owl callin'
To belong
She's cryin in the night
Be strong
And find the heart of the night owl fallin'
Stay up till dawn
Until the night is gone 

There's a bar right across the street

He'll get the girl 'cause he looks so fine
He's gonna win her every time
He knows he will, he's out there still
He's a night owl

So move on
There's a heart of a night owl callin'
To belong
He's cryin' in the night
Be strong
And find the heart of the night owl fallin'
Stay up till dawn until the night is gone
The night goes on and on
Until the night is gone.
