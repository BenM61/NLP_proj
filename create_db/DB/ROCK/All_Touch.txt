I pushed, her tense face, away from me
I pushed, her tense face away from me
The hard smile, the voice going on 
Like a razor blade on glass
All touch, but no contact
It hit me like, it hit me like
It hit me like a slap, oh-oh-oh, all touch
All touch, all touch and no contact

I pushed, his hand, away from me
I pushed, his ha-and away from me
Splintering fragments of conversation
Never got down to cold hard facts
All touch, but no contact
It stabbed me like, it stabbed me like
A knife in the back, oh oh oh, all touch
All touch, all touch and no contact

Tense my body for the final attack
Oh oh oh, all touch
All touch, all touch and no contact

I pushed, her tense face, away from me
I pushed, her tense face away from me
The hard smile, the voice going on 
Like a razor blade on glass
All touch, but no contact
It hit me like, it hit me like
It hit me like a slap, oh oh oh, all touch
All touch, all touch and no contact

Challenging eyes over the rim of a cocktail glass
Hoping I'd react, oh-oh-oh
All touch, all touch and no contact
It stabbed me like, it stabbed me like
A knife in the back, oh-oh-oh, all touch
All touch, all touch and no contact

Tense my body for the final attack
Oh-oh-oh, all touch
All touch, all touch and no contact
