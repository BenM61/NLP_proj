Some nights when I'm alone
I get up from a dream
I light a cigarette
I lie there in the dark
And think why we're apart
I just can't figure it

I'm living in the shadows
I got nowhere to go
Since you left I'm broken babe
I need you, don't you know?

One of those nights
Just one of those nights
Silence surrounds me
Your memory haunts me
It's one of those nights
It's just one of those nights
If only I had you to love me
On one of those nights

It's one of those nights... 

I gave her everything I had
How could she leave and just forget it?
I know it seems I've thrown my life away on her
I don't regret it

I'm living in the shadows
I got nowhere to go
Since you left I'm broken babe
I need you, don't you know?
 
One of those nights
Just one of those nights
Silence surrounds me
Your memory haunts me
It's one of those nights
It's just one of those nights
If only I had you to love me
On one of those nights

(It's one of those nights)

I'm living in the shadows
I got nowhere to go
Since you left I'm broken babe
I need you, don't you know?

One of those nights
Just one of those nights
Silence surrounds me
(KEY CHANGE)
Your memory haunts me
It's one of those nights
It's just one of those nights
If only I had you to love me
On one of those nights

Your memory haunts me
It's one of those nights
It's just one of those nights
If only I had you to love me
On one of those nights
