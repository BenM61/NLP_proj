You know I had to come all the way to England to sing with you
Aha
You know but it was worth the trip
Well thankyou
So, er I think we've got something to say
Let's go for it
Let's go for it? Alright why don't you take the first verse
O.K
Here we go

Yes I see you cryin'
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
And I feel your broken heart
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
I can feel you're hurting
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Still you chose to play the part
If you let me be
(If you let me be)
I'll be all you need, all you need

I wanna be the only one to hold you 
(Protect you from the rain)
I wanna be the only one to soothe you
(Erase all the pain)
I wanna be the only one to love you, love you
(Over again)
I wanna be the only one, the only one
(The only one I am)

Now you deserve a mansion
My lord you do
You can have the best of life
With all this I'll give you
A pure love that gold can't buy
If you take a chance
(If you take a chance)
I'll be worth the chance, worth the chance

I wanna be the only one to hold you 
(Protect you from the rain)
I wanna be the only one to soothe you
(Erase all the pain)
I wanna be the only one to love you, 
love you
(Over again)
I wanna be the only one, the only one
(The only one I am)

I wanna be the only one to hold you 
(Protect you from the rain)
I wanna be the only one to soothe you
(Erase all the pain)
I wanna be the only one to love you, love you
(Over again)
I wanna be the only one, the only one
(The only one I am)

If you let me be
If you let me be
I'll be all you need
If you take a chance
If you take a chance
I'll be worth the chance
If you just love me
You will gladly see
I'm all you need

I wanna be the only one to hold you 
(Protect you from the rain)
I wanna be the only one to soothe you
(Erase all the pain)
I wanna be the only one to love you, love you
(Over again)
I wanna be the only one, the only one
(The only one I am)

I wanna be the only one to hold you 
(Protect you from the rain)
I wanna be the only one to soothe you
(Erase all the pain)
I wanna be the only one to love you, love you
(Over again)
I wanna be the only one, the only one
(The only one I am)
