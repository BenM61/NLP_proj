I can't let you go tonight without a fight 
Oh you been sending love signs that feel so right 
When we move you talk of love I understand 
Oh baby there is no time like the first time 
I will hold you to the promises you made 
I know you'll be worth the wait 
When you're turning your words into action 
Letting your body do all the talking 
I wanna know how it feels 
When we love the first time 
When you're turning your words into action 
Letting your body do all the talking 


I can't let you go tonight but I know the way you feel 
I need real love 
I will old you and the promises you've made 
I know we can find the way 


I wanna know if this is the real thing 

Yes I do baby 
Moving in time with you 
Oh won't you show me 
Living up to what you say 
Take my breath away
