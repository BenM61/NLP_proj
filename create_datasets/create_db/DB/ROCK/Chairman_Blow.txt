Chairman Blow, a saddled elevator
To some he was just a sad operator
Singleness of purpose he had
Open wounds where his timing was bad
Chairman Blow, the wolf's at the door
He ate up all the cake and he's coming back for more
Here stands the man with a lawn to mow
Because he has to feed a koh
Chairman Blow can't stand the Three Stooges show
No lawn to Mao, can't feed the cow
