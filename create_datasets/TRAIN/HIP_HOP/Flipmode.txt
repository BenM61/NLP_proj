Faded off the woo hah
You know I'm faded off the woo hah
Busting, busting out the trap
In the coupe doing laps
Got me a Dominican mami
Folding paper, origami
Rag em', rag em' on sight
Spliff Star off the hype
Ain't got no time to fall in love
Ain't no time to fall in love
When the push come to shove
Money all I ever love
Gary Payton with the glove
O.J. Simpson with the glove
Guilty pleasure, pick your poison
We got all of the above
Shooter, shooters on deck
Still banging with the set
Thirty thousand in the P.J.
Got my niggas out the jakes
Surfing through the village, bust it, bust it up
Diamonds on me flooded bust down
Ever since she let me bust it, bust it up
She be wanting me to cuff now, go

Something foreign when I'm skurting up (skurt)
If they coming, better hurry up
Wrist game, I'ma stir it up (whip it)
'Till the white McFlurry up
Mickey D's, I'm loving it
Super bad, McLoving it
Slide up in it with the oven mitt
Now she calling out my government
Freddy Kruger with the glove
Michael Jackson with the glove
Keep it lit and get the money
I do both of the above
I've been jugging since flip phones
Bed rocking like Flintstones
Doing numbers in my zip code
Squad with it on flipmode
Shawty 'bout to let her clip go
Busta, busta, busta, bust that
A big butt and a smile

Flipmode, you don't ball like this, hell no
My whole team lit, it's simple
What you want? Just tell me what you want, baby
What you doing? Let's just start with foreplay
When I perform, your shaking make the bed break
Until the the morning
Your lips turn me on, baby
Smoke one with me, let's get faded
Hit the showers, heat it up, still wide awake
I don't even know, she say she got a man at home
I love her anyway
And if that nigga say he love you like he do
Where your wedding ring?
