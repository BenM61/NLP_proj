Late at night if you're lonely, girl
Love is overdue
The tiredness of a broken heart
Has cast its shadow on you

You're so tired of flirting
You want a love that's certain
You want a love that will last

Getting out harmful
From this accelerated romance
And I'll give love to you fast

I'll be your knight in shining amour
When you call my name I'll come to ease the pain
I'll ride the night like a black stallion, baby
I'll be bearing the torch to ignite your flames

Cause I'm a night rider, I'm a love provider
Night rider, I'll come for you in the night
Night rider, I'm gonna take you higher
Night rider

It's cold and you're shivering, baby
Nobody knows why you weep
The night has dealt you a dirty hand
I aint gonna let you sleep, no no no

I've come to comfort you, now
Yeah, I'm sure, I know how
To satisfy your needs

I've got my engine running
Oh no, girl, I'm coming
To make your night complete

I'll be your knight in shining amour
When you call my name I'll come to ease the pain
I'll ride the night like a black stallion, baby
I'll be bearing the torch to ignite your flames

Cause I'm a night rider, I'm a love provider
Night rider, I'll come for you in the night
Night rider, I'm gonna take you higher
Night rider, no one else can make you feel alright

Night rider, I'm a love provider
Night rider, I will come for you in the night
Night rider, I'm gonna take you higher
Night rider, ooh baby, please

Night rider, let me take it to the max, baby
Night rider, oh baby
Night rider, I will ride you through the night
Night rider, baby, let me, let me

I'll be your knight in shining amour
When you call my name I'll come to ease the pain
I'll ride the night like a black stallion, baby
I'll be bearing the torch to ignite your flames

Cause I'm a night rider, I'm a love provider
Night rider, I'll come for you in the night
Night rider, let me take you higher
Night rider, let me take it to the max, baby

Night rider, I'm a love provider
Night rider, let me take it high, baby
Night rider, let me do, do, let me get to you
Night rider, let me do, do, let me get to you
Night rider, let me do, do, let me get to you
