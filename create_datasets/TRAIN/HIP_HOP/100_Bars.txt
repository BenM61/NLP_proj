Yeah! That's the beat right there. 
I'm about to black out with 100 bars on some professional shit. 
So don't try this at home  yo. 
Yo  yo  yo 

My style of rhymin is ancient like Aztecs and Mayans 
Because I recognize its all about timin' 
Me and my freestyle alliance practicin' African voodoo science 
In front of 20 ft. bonfires lookin' skyward 

Calculating May 5  2000 the nine planets'll be in alignment 
The arrival of the prophet in the cockpit 
Of a starship the size of the Hale-Bopp comet 
With mercury ion rockets 

And a big ass "Canibus comin soon" poster on the side of it 
I'm known geographically and intergalactically 
That's why I got extraterrestrials that want to battle me 
They even tried kidnappin' me 

And they would've snatched me 
If their craft didn't get trapped in the Earth's gravity 
Engines stalled and failed. Crashed into a farmer's field 
And that's really what caused Roswell 

Undercover operatives workin' for COM 12 
Disguised as a nigga signed with a record deal 
Lyrically I'm off scale 
So all hail or get tossed towards Hell, whatever y'all feel 

Briusin' niggas, confusin' niggas like Chip Fu from the Fu-Schnickens 
Hit you with nuclear cruiser missiles 
Hear the wild wolf growl 
Styles stockpiled for miles from the ground to the clouds 

Wack niggas want to be down but its not allowed 
Interrupt the cipher unannounced and you'll get punched in the mouth 
With the southpaw southern fist 
I'll bust your shit. Swell your lip and get the Bubba shrimp 

Back the tougher shit. What a wimp 
You giant Goliath. Niggas get shot with a rubber sling 
I'm an experiment gone bad. 
My brainwave's on an ????? graph. Yo, I'm stark ravin mad 

Your whole scientific staff'll get killed in a nuclear blast 
When I throw the ????? flask in my hand 
Flammable liquids in the lab explode 
And you get stabbed with all the flyin glass 

Trained to blow up commercial aircrafts 
Trained in chemical weapons class 
Just to see how long a nigga's breath'll last 
I put him in a leather mask 

Spray his ass with a can of ???? gas 
Then watch him grab his neck and gag 
Watch the nigga choke to death as I laugh 
"You want to battle?" is the type of question you should never ask 

Nigga, pick a tougher task. See who the f*ck'll last 
Whoever lose'll get a solderin' iron up the ass 
You need to recognize 
My hand is quicker than the eye 

Quicker than the 5 speed Jamiroquai drives 
A lifespan longer than 9 lives. Infinite rhymes that can't die 
A nigga with a divine mind 
I dedicate this to the wise. Dedicate it to dames 

Dividin' myself into 100 ten times 
You can't deny the offering's an offer 
Flows that glow with aurora's the spark of light 
Water fly like a saucer 
With the torque of a Porsche 
Murder a million MCs then autograph all of their coffins 
Been gettin' it on since I been born and I'm a live long 

And I'm a be gettin' it on till I'm gone 
Look at all the stages I been on. All the songs that I spit on 
I took an oath to rip everything I get on 
A nigga like me should have Carpal Tunnel syndromes 

In the wristbones from grippin' microphones this long 
I'm just a small fish in a big pond 
And gets pissed off whenever I gets picked on 
Nigga try to flip and get flipped on 

My army march a million strong 
Like the nation of Islam with suede timbs on 
Extremely hostile 
Fully armed troops dressed in frog suits and night vision goggles 

A lyrical lynch mob 
Shittin' on niggas drawn to a hideous form with horns and a mink on 
Duckin' down low like Vietnam fightin' the Vietcong 
Screamin' "incomin'" when I see a bomb 

Speak to your leader. Surrender your arms 
You need about a million more soldiers to even the odds 
Plus 800,000 to even consider a war 
And 200,000 more to even look hard 

You better drop your flag and withdraw 
My cavalry charge accompanied by a blizzard of wicked metaphors 
And smash y'all. Attach y'all to the back of my horse 
And drag y'all across the motherfuckin' asphalt 

9 out of 10 niggas is frauds 
You know who you are always talkin' about your bitches and your cars 
Your jewelry and your girls. It's like we from two different worlds 
You motherfuckers really get on my nerves 

'Cause I'm beyond them, on some futuristic cyborg shit 
I close my eyes when I freestyle so I could read what picture crossed in 
Then raise my arms like a sorcerer and cast a fireball into the audience 
To barbecue your brain organs 

You feel like you've been thrown in a microwave oven 
I flame broil suckers and hit 'em with some more shit 
The raw shit. Call my reinforcements, the four horsemen 
Take a big piece of chalk and draw a line across the stage pulpit 

I dare a motherfucker to cross it 
I'll even call my man Black Rob at two in the mornin 
Tell him it's important. Tell him to call Sting 3 way and sing a 

Break your camcorders so you motherfuckers can't record it 
Call the news, I'll kill your reporters 
Start a lawsuit, I'll kill your lawyers 
F*ck the soft shit and f*ck what y'all think 

My album's gold cause my album was the bomb, shit 
Y'all niggas got your ass beat cause you asked for it 
Got your picture taken and put in a tabloid 
'Cause you a man and you like to touch little boys 

You f*ck 'em in the ass, then you give 'em cash for it 
That's some sick shit homeboy 
A hundred years ago, they'd have took you to see Sigmund Freud 
You fraudulent. Feminine. Fragile as a feather is 

With an effortless blow, I'll crack your whole skeleton 
You think you're better than Canibus, where's the evidence? 
You got below average intelligence and poor penmanship 
You need to shut the f*ck up cause your breath stink 

Take fifty cents and purchase a pack of peppermints 
Battlin' me you never win 
You thought you was the only nigga that could sneak a weapon in? 
Nigga guess again 

'Cause after I'm finished wreckin this shit 
I'm a drink a whole bottle of Henney and go f*ck a lesbian
