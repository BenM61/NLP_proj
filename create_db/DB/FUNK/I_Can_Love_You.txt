I can love you, (I can love you)
I can love you, (I can love you)
I can love you better than she can

I can love you, (I can love you)
I can love you, (I can love you)
I can love you better than she can

Sitting here,
Wondering why you don't love me
The way that I love you
And baby have no fear
'Cause I would never ever hurt you
And you know my love is real, boy I can

I can love you, (I can love you)
I can love you, (I can love you)
I can love you better than she can

I can love you, (I can love you)
I can love you, (I can love you)
I can love you better than she can

I know some times
Can get rough but we'll make it
We'll make it through the storm
And I know I will try
To make sure that you can trust me
And you know the reason why that I say

(I can love you) I can love you
A little better than she can oh,
(I know that you) I know that you
Wish that you could be my man
'Cause I can love you better than she can

I can love you, (I can love you)
I can love you, (I can love you)
I can love you better than she can

I can love you, (I can love you)
I can love you, (I can love you)
I can love you better than she can

If I told you once, I told you twice,
Q. B. throw the bootie, like a groupie for mo' ice
Armor truck heist, hit the bonus like N'Bushe,
In love wit' you since the days of "Juicy"
Now I watch you play Columbo, Picasso
Tricks inside colassals, turn you castles to brothels, Uh!
Who you lovin', who you wanna be huggin?
Dippin on ya Ninja Honda with Tanisha and Rhonda, Wha!

Who's gonna make you feel the way I do?
Nobody, nobody
Who's gonna make you feel the way I do?
Nobody, nobody

I can love you, (I can love you)
