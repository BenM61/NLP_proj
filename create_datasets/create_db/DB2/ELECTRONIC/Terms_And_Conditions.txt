Greed is on the lady
It's on the bone
Greed is on the lady,
Oh, it's time to fall

Naked on the bedroom
We died alone
Breathing on my baby,
Oh, it's not my fault

It's not the money
It's not her fault
Naked on the bedroom
Oh, I should've known

My baby
I've been a fool
Now the sound of loving
Is old and somehow gone

Who said not to leave?
Never known a boy to be so mean.
Another soul lost in love
Holding on and on

Oh she lusts on me
Not enough to last on love
Oh greed got to me
Holding on and on

It's on the bottle
It's on the cone
Greed is in the waiting,
Oh, waiting to fall

Waiting in the bedroom
I die alone
Waiting on my baby,
Oh, it's not my fault

It's not the honey
She's on her knees
Naked in the bedroom,
Oh, I should've known

My baby
I've been a fool
Now the sound of loving
Is old and somehow gone

Who said not to leave?
Never known a boy to be so mean.
Another soul lost in love
Holding on and on

Oh she lusts on me
Not enough to last on love
Oh greet got to me
Holding on and on
