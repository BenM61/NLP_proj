Break a bone
Got me on my knees,
You break my heart, just to watch it bleed
I'm sick with love
Sick like a disease
Don't call me up, just so I can please you

I can't stand the way you're smiling
I can't stand the way I'm lying

I know, I know, I know you got the key
And you know, you know, you know that it's for me
It's not up to you, you know it's up to me but
Curiosity will never let me go ohoh, ohoh oh
Uh oh, oh oh, ohoh oh
Will never let me go ohoh, ohoh oh
Uh oh, oh oh, ohoh, oh

Look at me
Left here in the corner
Stupid girl, I really tried to warn her
Walked the streets all night, until you came around
Knew that you would come, before you ever even made a sound

I know, I know, I know you got the key
And you know, you know, you know that it's for me
It's not up to you, you know it's up to me but
Curiosity will never let me go ohoh, ohoh oh
Uh oh, oh oh, ohoh oh
Will never let me go ohoh, ohoh, oh
Uh oh, oh oh, ohoh, oh curiosity

So don't break me tonight
This is crazy love and you know I'm gonna follow you home
Through the rain
'Cause I need your love, and you know I'm gonna follow you home

'Cause I need your love and you know I'm going to follow you

I know, I know, I know you got the key
You know, you know, you know that it's for me
Well I think that we should try it out and see yeah
Curiosity

So don't break me tonight
This is crazy love
And you know I'm gonna follow you home
Through the rain
'Cause I need your love, yes I need your love

So don't break (Don't break) me tonight (Me tonight)
This is crazy love
And you know I'm gonna follow you home
Through the rain
'Cause I need your love, yes I need your love

Will never let me go ohoh, ohoh oh
Uh oh, oh oh, ohoh, oh
Will never let me go ohoh, ohoh oh
Uh oh, oh oh, ohoh, oh curiosity will never let me go
Oohh oh oh, oohh oh oh
