The color of infinity
Inside an empty glass
I'm squinting my eye
I'm turning off and on and on and off the light
It's for this experimental film
Which nobody knows about and which 
I'm still figuring out what's going to go in my experimental film

Yeah!
You're all gonna be in this experimental film 
And even though I can't explain it, I already know how great it's

I already know the ending
It's the part that makes your face implode
I don't know what makes your face implode, 
But that's the way the movie ends
And in my experimental film
Which nobody knows about but which
I'm still figuring out
Your face implodes at my experimental film

Yeah!
You're all gonna be in this experimental film 
And even though I can't explain it, I already know how great it's
And even though I can't explain it, I already know how great it's
