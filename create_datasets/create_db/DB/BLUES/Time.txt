HEY WAIT, I DIDN'T MEAN TO SAY IT LIKE THAT
WORDS OFTEN SEEM TO MAKE IT ALL WORSE
I'M FOR YOU AND YOU'RE FOR ME FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH
I GIVE UP AND YOU GIVE IN, THAT'S WHY IT HURTS
WILL WE EVER LEARN?
WILL WE EVER LEARN?

TIME, EVERYTHING'S A MATTER OF
TIME, ALL WE HAVE TO SPEND IS
TIME, EVERYTHING WILL HAPPEN
IN TIME, (AND) THAT'S ALL RIGHT BY ME

HELP, WE'RE STRAY OUT ON THIS FIELD OF DREAMS
OH NO, WE'RE CAUGHT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN OUR NEEDS
I REACH OUT AND SO DO YOU BUT NOT MY WAY
LOVE DON'T CHANGE, PEOPLE DO AND SO WE MAY
WILL WE EVER LEARN?
WILL WE EVER LEARN?

TIME, EVERYTHING'S A MATTER OF
TIME, ALL WE HAVE TO SPEND IS
TIME, EVERYTHING WILL HAPPEN
IN TIME, (AND) THAT'S ALL RIGHT BY ME

(STRINGS) ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN
WE CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN
OH IT CAN HAPPEN 
JUST GIVE IT TIME

FAITH, WE'VE GOT TO LEARN TO SHOW A LITTLE FAITH
LET'S FLY, TOGETHER LIKE THE SOARING WIND
BURN WITH HOPE AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL UNDERSTAND
THE TRUTH WE SEARCH IS RIGHT HERE IN THE PALM OF OUR HANDS
WILL WE EVER LEARN ?
WILL WE EVER LEARN?

TIME, EVERYTHING'S A MATTER OF
TIME, ALL WE HAVE TO SPEND IS
TIME, EVERYTHING WILL HAPPEN
IN TIME, (AND) THAT'S ALL RIGHT BY ME

TIME, EVERYTHING'S A MATTER OF
TIME, ALL WE HAVE TO SPEND IS
TIME, EVERYTHING WILL HAPPEN
IN TIME, (AND) THAT'S ALL RIGHT BY ME)
