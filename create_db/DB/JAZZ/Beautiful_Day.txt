Rise and shine
Come on let's roll
Me and my baby
We're pure as gold

It's a beautiful day
So let's fly away
The two of us rush into tomorrow

Ooh, let's get it on
Life's such a sexy song
And you know what?

It's a beautiful day
In a beautiful way
The two of us rush into tomorrow

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo da da da da
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo da da da da

Right as rain
Feeling strong, oh oh oh
You and me
We can't go wrong

It's a beautiful day
So let's fly away
The two of us rush into tomorrow

It's a beautiful day
So let's fly away
The two of us rush into tomorrow

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo da da da da
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo da da da da

Let's get it on baby

Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Hey!

It's a beautiful day
Let's fly away
The two of us rush into tomorrow

Hey, it's a beautiful day
The two of us rush into tomorrow
