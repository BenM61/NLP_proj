Life is dull, it's nothing but one big lull, then presto you do a skull
And find that you're reeling, she sighs and you're feeling like a toy on a string
And your heart goes: "Ring-a-ding ding, ring-a-ding ding, ring-a-ding ding"
How could that funny face that seemed to be common place

Project you right in to space. without any warning
Don't know if its morning, night-time, winter or spring
What's the difference: Ring-a-ding ding, ring-a-ding ding, ring-a-ding ding
She takes (grabs) your hand - this captivating creature

And like its planned - you're in the phone book looking (hunting) for the nearest preacher
Life is swell, you're off to that small hotel, and somewhere a village bell
Will sound in the steeple, announcing to people, Love's the loveliest thing
And the bell goes: "Ring-a-ding ding, ring-a-ding ding, ring-a-ding ding"
