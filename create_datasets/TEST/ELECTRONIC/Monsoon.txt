Look at you in bed, you're hardly breathin'
I knew it was gonna end this way
I said it all the time, but you said that you were fine
And now you wonder why, and why you
I tried my best to make you check it out, huh?
I cried so much it burnt my eyes, I begged every day
But all the stubborn things you do
I must've gotten that from you
Now there's nothing they can do, and why you?
I wished that there was somethin' I'd done more
Knocked you out and dragged you there myself
Maybe then you'd be here, you'd be here

Tuck my things we've grown up to
And how much I love you every way
But you're not here, and with all my tears
It feels like Monsoon every day

Monsoon

Look into your eyes, do you see me?
Staring into space, you've lost yourself
The rain has fallen through, and there's nothing I can do
But just cry all over you, and why you?
Play our favorite songs, do you hear them?
Take us back to times so happy, with good health
Traveling galore, just the two of us in store
And the plans we had for more, and why you?
Never thought that there would be an ending
Father loved strong enough to make you stay
If it was, if it was
You'd be here, you'd be here

Tuck my things we've grown up to
And how much I love you every way
But you're not here, with all my tears
It feels like Monsoon every day

Halo halo halo

Monsoon
You'd be here
Monsoon
Monsoon
Monsoon
Feels like Monsoon every day
Monsoon
Monsoon
You'd be here
Monsoon
Monsoon
Monsoon
Monsoon
Monsoon
Feels like Monsoon every day

Halo Amber, I love you
