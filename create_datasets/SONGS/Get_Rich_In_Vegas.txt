Oho oho, oho oho, oho ohooo
Get rich in Vegas
Oho oho, oho oho, oho oho

A world of wonder,
Outside your door,
Waiting there for you,
It's a notion you can dive in to
Break the fences that hold you back,
Keep staring at the wall this could be your wake up call

And try and close your eyes today,
I'll Carry you away

Let's go see new Mexico
Surf through streets of Tokyo
Ride the waves from coast to coast
(Get rich in Vegas)
Get lost in Australia
Find true love in Arabia
Sail out to the moon and back
(Get rich in Vegas)

So now we know,
How easy it can be
To turn around the scenery
So let's sing along to stupid clique songs
And get hold of friends we never known
And it's only just begun
Shout it out to everyone

And try and close your eyes today,
I'll Carry you away, carry you away

Let's go see new Mexico
Surf through streets of Tokyo
Ride the waves from coast to coast
(Get rich in Vegas)
Get lost in Australia
Find true love in Arabia
Sail out to the moon and back
(Get rich in Vegas)

Oho oho, oho oho, oho Ohio

Let's go see new Mexico
Surf through streets Tokyo
Ride the waves from coast to coast
Get lost in Australia
Find true love in Arabia
Sail out to the moon and back
(Get rich in Vegas)

Let's go
(Oho oho)
Surf through
(Oho oho)
Ride the
(Oho oho)
(Get rich in Vegas)
Get lost
(Oho oho)
Find love (yeah)
(Oho oho)
Sail out
(Oho oho)
