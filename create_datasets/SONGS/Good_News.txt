Good news, there was no room in hell. 
So though you did not keep your promises, 
neither did anyone else.
From the first catch of your eyes, 
there was little or nothing implied. 
Sorry you mistook...what we're all learning.  

It used to break my heart but it doesn't anymore. 
It used to break my heart but it doesn't anymore.  
I won't hold my breath, I won't hold my breath while you settle the score. 

Every man for himself and everyones the same.  
Staring off into space and caring less if you came.  
I want to slow down. 
I want to slow down. 

It used to break my heart but it doesn't anymore. 
It used to break my heart but it doesn't anymore.  
I won't hold my breath anymore.
