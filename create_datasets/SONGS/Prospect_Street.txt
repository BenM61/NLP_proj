So you're telling me again about Prospect Street
And I'm wondering just what fortune I'll meet
You'd never believe it
You know that I just can't see
How wonderful the imagination can be 
But there's something in the back of my mind
Say's it'll all fall into place in time
But it's a genuine fact of life
That the sun never shines on Prospect Street

You talk about love
Love of the good things
And the problems that the hand of fate brings
I take a walk to wherever I'm going
And I'm sure you know
That's a long, long way from heaven

But when I'm listening to the twilight sound
And there's still people up moving around
You know the sad thing about it is
That I would really love to think it exists - Prospect Street

On Prospect Street

You better believe in it
And you can make anything come true
You can take it or leave it
When I'm down on Prospect Street

On Prospect Street
