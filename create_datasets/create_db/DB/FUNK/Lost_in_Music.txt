We're lost in music; caught in a trap.
No turning back. We're lost in music.
We're lost in music. Feel so alive.
I quit my nine-to-five. We're lost in music.

Have you ever seen some people lose everything?
First to go is their mind.
Responsibility to me is a tragedy.
I'll get a job some other time.
I want to join a band and play in front of crazy fans.
Yes
I call that temptation.
Give me a melody. That's all that I ever need.
The music is my salvation.

We're lost in music; caught in a trap

In the spotlight
The band plays so very tight

Each and every night.
It's not vanity. To me
It's my sanity.
I could never survive.
Some people ask of me: What are you gonna be?
Why don't you go get a job? All that I can say:
I won't give up my music
Not me
Not now
No way
No how.

We're lost in music
Caught in a trap
Caught in our muslc.
No turning back. We're lost in music.
We're lost in music - don't take away our music

Feel so alive
Feel.
I quit I quit my nine-to-five. Yeah
We're lost in music.
We're lost in music melody is good to me.
Caught in a trap
I'm caught.
Oh baby
No turning back. No
No
No
We're lost in music.
We're lost in music.
