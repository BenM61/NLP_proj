Heedless they make their pile
Freeloading monkeys on our back
Bad to the bone and spineless
A dirty, lying, riotous pack

Ostrich policy, wrong way
Don't fall asleep or you'll have to pay
Draconian penalty, right way
Ready to explode

Like a fistful of dynamite
My fuse is burning fast
Like a fistful of dynamite
Like a bomb heading for your ass
Like a fistful of dynamite
My fuse is burning short
Like a fistful of dynamite
Don't push too far
Or we will be your court

They drain us of our lifeblood
But we are a dredging up the truth
Staunch as a steely dreadnought
So they'll never stir up our Ruth

Ostrich policy, wrong way
Don't fall asleep or you'll have to pay
Draconian penalty, right way
Ready to explode

Like a fistful of dynamite
My fuse is burning fast
Like a fistful of dynamite
Like a bomb heading for your ass
Like a fistful of dynamite
My fuse is burning short
Like a fistful of dynamite
Don't push too far
Or we will be your court

Don't push too far
We've fed up with your tricks
Yes, fear our law
You will get your deserved kicks

Ostrich policy, wrong way
Don't fall asleep or you'll have to pay
Draconian penalty, right way
Ready to explode

Like a fistful of dynamite
My fuse is burning fast
Like a fistful of dynamite
Like a bomb heading for your ass
Like a fistful of dynamite
My fuse is burning short
Like a fistful of dynamite
Don't push too far
Or we will be your court
