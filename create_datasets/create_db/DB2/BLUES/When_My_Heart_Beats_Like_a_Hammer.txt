When my heart get to beating like a hammer
And my eyes get full of tears
Oh, when my heart get to beating like a hammer
And my eyes get full of tears
Well, you only been gone twenty-four hours, baby
Oh, but it seems like, it seems like a million years

Well, if I ever mistreated you, darlin'
God knows I didn't mean no harm
Oh, if I ever mistreated you baby
You knows I didn't mean no harm
Well, you know, I'm just a little country boy
And was raised right down on the cotton farm

Oh, all right

Oh, you give me so much trouble
Babe, I don't know what to do
Oh, you give me so much trouble, baby
Darlin', don't know what to do
Well, I ain't got nothing now, baby
Babe, and it's all on account of you
