It's been a tough time for you
But I've never seen you cry
The last time that I saw you
I never got to say goodbye

You're the reason I am living
And to you I owe a lot
And I'm happy for what you've given
You're everything I've got
You're everything I've got

I haven't done much for you
And I'm afraid I never will
Didn't tell you that I'm sorry
For the part of you I killed

You're the reason I am living
And to you I owe a lot
And I'm happy for what you've given
You're everything I've got
You're everything I've got

There were times when I did hate you
And I wished that you were dead
But I tried to valuate you
And see the good in you instead

You're the reason I am living
And to you I owe a lot
And I'm happy for what you've given
You're everything I've got
You're everything I've got

Oh I miss you
I always will
I love you still, brother
Oh I miss you
I always will
I love you still, brother
