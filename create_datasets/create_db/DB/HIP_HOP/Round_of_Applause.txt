We ain't supposed to be here, never thought we'd see it
Now we livin' proof, tell the world to believe it
Congratulations, thank God we made it
They told us we was nothing, now I know they hate it
Round of applause, round of applause
Congratulations, we beat them odds
Round of applause, round of applause
Congratulations, we beat them odds

I ain't supposed to be nothing but a dope dealer, but a hope killer
Supposed to brag on the guns and the Coke kilos, 
Dropping mollies in a Coke Zero
Ashamed of my education, that I'm finally off probation
That I quit smoking, got a wife and kids,
And I'm a real father, no fakin'
See I'm a black man who beat them odds, 
Supposed to be locked up with no job
Never shoulda went to college or learned who God is, 
You add it up it's so odd
See I never knew my pops, I've been abused, ran from the cops
I went to school high on them crops, wasn't a thug, never been shot
Running from God man turning my back, 
Never would have made it - Marvin Sapp
But he opened up my eyes and I can't look back, 
While they look surprised I just tip my cap
Yeah he did it, he did it, he changed me and I'm with it
He made me what I'm supposed to be, 
You get close to me you might get it

We ain't supposed to be here, never thought we'd see it
Now we livin' proof, tell the world to believe it
Congratulations, thank God we made it
They told us we was nothing, now I know they hate it
Round of applause, round of applause
Congratulations, we beat them odds
Round of applause, round of applause
Congratulations, we beat them odds

I ain't even supposed to be here, I ain't even supposed to be livin'
The world is set up for me to be death row 
'Cause some went locked up in prison
Yeah I know that he watched, and yeah I know that he listenin'
And yeah I know that hip-hop believes it's my plan for me to be missin'
And cover it up with the clich? okey-dokes, 
And blame it on the pain pill overdose
From the city where they love to hate, 
But I still got love for my homies though
They don't wanna see us ball out, but we do it anyway
Got a mil in the bank, another 2 up in the safe
'Cause I do it everyday, know- know me, ain't no rumors in the A
All they say is that I coulda pooled in the 8, don't assume anything
I'm a fool with the pay, I be doomed till your daylight

We ain't supposed to be here, never thought we'd see it
Now we livin' proof, tell the world to believe it
Congratulations, thank God we made it
They told us we was nothing, now I know they hate it
Round of applause, round of applause
Congratulations, we beat them odds
Round of applause, round of applause
Congratulations, we beat them odds

Now she used to strip at Onyx, working her way through college
Tryna put food in her son's mouth, on a pole for them dollars
She was looking for some solace, told the Lord, I promise
I'm heading to the hills with my heels on
Where the feels ain't a touch to the billfolds
No copping feels from no Uncle Phil's, just Phil Jackson coach her
And get her out that game where they losin' they dignity for a Coach purse
No skirts, just "skrr", found another way around a road work
And left that fine establishment,
It's like her whole life is having a growth spurt
She out the game and they hate it, mad at her she made it
They ain't nothing but some shellfish in a bucket, 
Probably get crabs if you touch it
Now she graduated from college - scratch that - graduated with honors
Little man got a little cap and gown, look at him matching his mama, yeah!

We ain't supposed to be here, never thought we'd see it
Now we livin' proof, tell the world to believe it
Congratulations, thank God we made it
They told us we was nothing, now I know they hate it
Round of applause, round of applause
Congratulations, we beat them odds
Round of applause, round of applause
Congratulations, we beat them odds
