All I get is quiet,
Laughing friends won't buy it.
I've been known to tell them white lies,
But this time I swear it's the truth, oh, oh.
I just got back from heaven.

I can see their faces
As I mention places,
Places that I've overdescribed,
But this time I swear it's the truth, oh, oh.
I just got back from heaven.

Heaven isn't so far away.
You walk through the door
And you're light years away.
Someone looks right into your eyes,
And you feel the magic that you can't deny,
And you sway
All through the night.
If you stay
All through the night.
Look at the shape I'm in,
I just got back from heaven.

Searching for some glory.
People make up stories;
One too many drinks at the bar.
But this time I swear it's the truth, oh, oh.
I just got back from heaven.

Heaven isn't so far away.
You walk through the door
And you're light years away.
Someone looks right into your eyes,
And you feel the magic that you can't deny,
And you sway
All through the night.
If you stay
All through the night.
Look at the shape I'm in,
I just got back from heaven.

Any destination
Makes a great vacation.
This is something greater by far.
This time I swear it's the truth, oh, oh.
I just got back from heaven.
