Stop for a moment just to see where you're goin'
If you sure that is what you wanna know
Now that you think that the end is worth knowin'
Back to the start is where you wanna go

Hey, everybody is
Just about the same, just about the same
Hey, when you finally see
From where we came, from where we came

Ask me your question and I'll give you your answer
Are you part of everybody, yes, you are
Where do you think all these people have come from
Are you their brother, well, I guess you are

Hey, everybody is
Just about the same, just about the same
Hey, when you finally see
From where we came, from where we came
