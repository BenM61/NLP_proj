These palm trees they sway
Each night and each day
I'm California dreamin' 'bout you
Ah yeah, got this world class view
But it's you that I think about every time when my mind zoning
It's you that I think about every time that I get lonely
It's you that I call on my FaceTime when I need something real
I work the night shift 'til late in the PM
I'm California dreamin'
You, you, you

California dreamin' 'bout you
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
California dreamin' bout' you
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Not quite right sometimes, 'cause I
I've been feeling myself too much
Feeling myself too much oh I'm missing your touch
Missing the way you say my name
Hate that I'm away, you know I'd stay
But I got these songs to cut
In the stu' with an empty cup
I've been sipping this drink too much
But Goddamn, I've been working hard as f*ck
And what's work without play in L.A?
I'm California dreamin'
Dreamin' 'bout you, you, you, you-you, you
One time I tell 'em I'm California dreamin', dreamin' dreamin'
One time I tell 'em I'm California dreamin', dreamin' dreamin'

California dreamin' 'bout you 
California dreamin', dreamin' dreamin' (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
California dreamin' 'bout you (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)

Don't wake me up, just bake-cake me up
And get a whiff of these tasty buds 
And HD cuz, I'm thinkin' 'bout safes and hugs
I chase the love, cheese please
Palm trees, breeze, ease your mind I put C.R.E.A.M. on it
Lay back relax, now dream on it
Watchu think? You want a drink?
You wanna sea on the shore, make you walk the plank
Skydive, overview
California what a point of view
The weather, whatever, endure your endeavor 
If you ride with me baby we can do this forever
In a day, yessir ain't no other way
This is Cali-for-ni-a
(Dream on, dream on)

One time I tell 'em I'm California dreamin', dreamin' dreamin'
California dreamin' 'bout you 
California dreamin', dreamin' dreamin'
California dreamin' 'bout you 

You, you, you, you-you, you

California dreamin' 'bout you
