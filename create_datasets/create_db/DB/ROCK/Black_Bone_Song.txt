Seven men on a dead man's coffin
Waiting 'till the rumour will be true
Seven souls are damned for ever
Eternally bound to sing the tune
Black Bone Song, it's never ending a unique minor key,
Black Bone Song come along hell bound on the sea.
Risk a view at the brink of death
Treasure hunters, they're never coming back
Seven voices scream and shout,
Found an escape through the hole in the ground.
This old legend of seven sailor's lives
Drinking rum, singing black bone's rhymes
Seven pains cry out loud
Digging out the tale, out of the ground.
