I've got to find an occupation, I've got to keep myself employed
It's a bad situation, my brain's destroyed
I've got to find a new vocation, I feel it burning down inside
Such a low down abrasion inside; it hurts my pride

I hear it, I know it, I touch it, I feel it, I see it
Someday, we will have won; I can feel it in my bones
This is the one
I hear it, I know it, I touch it, I feel it, I see it
Someday, thy will be done; I can feel it in my bones
This is the one

Got a bad situation, I can feel it building up inside
Got a certain reputation, outside, outside
I've got another situation, I can feel it building to my soul
Hell bent, hell raising, I feel it through my soul

I hear it, I know it, I touch it, I feel it, I see it
Someday, we will have won; I can feel it in my bones
This is the one
I hear it, I know it, I touch it, I feel it, I see it
Someday, thy will be done; I can feel it in my bones
This is the one

I hear it, I know it, I touch it, I feel it, I see it
Someday, thy kingdom come; I can feel it in my bones
This is the one
I hear it, I know it, I touch it, I feel it, I see it
(This is your son)
This is the one
I hear, I tough it, I feel it, I see it
Someday, thy will be done; I can feel it in my bones
This is the one
