Ooh, baby, ah

Sorry to disturb you
But I had to get this off my chest
I know you've been real busy
Don't have time for emotional stress

You see, taking care of home
Means more than just the rent
It means calling now and then
On occasions dropping in
And sometimes having flowers sent

What if I stayed out late
And didn't even call
Wasn't there to pick you up
Whenever you fall

If I didn't smile
And compliment you when I should
Tell me what would you do
If the shoe was on the other foot?
Still, what would you do?

Oh, I, I think you take for granted
That I'm always gonna be here
This is your final notice
Soon I'm gonna disappear

I'm not asking for a whole lot
Just think of me now and then
If you don't know what I'm saying
I don't know how this love can win

And didn't even call
Wasn't there to pick you up
Whenever you fall

If I didn't smile
And compliment you when I should
Tell me what would you do
If the shoe was on the other foot?

Well, you should do unto others
As you would have them do to you
You reap what you sow and that's how it goes
So be careful what you do
Telling you ain't no good gonna come to you

If I stayed out late and didn't even call
There to pick you up
Whenever you fall

If I didn't smile
And compliment you when I should
What would you do
If the shoe was on the other foot?

I stayed out late
And didn't even call
There to pick you up
Whenever you fall

If I didn't smile
And compliment you when I should
What would you do
The shoe was on the other foot

Tell me, tell me what would you do
If you had to, tell me
If you had to do like I do sometimes
