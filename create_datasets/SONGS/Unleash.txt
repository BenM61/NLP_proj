War after war
The lion roar
Hell after hell
Cambodian death bells
Scum after scum
They blot out the sun
Hill after hills
In the killing fields

No more fear of failure
No more suffering
No more lies, I will arise
From blood filled rivers of my enemies

Unleash war
Unleash my wrath
Unleash revenge
Unleash my hell

Pig after pig
The blood runs cold
Stone after stone
The kingdom comes
Doom after doom
The fallen ruins
Hate after hate
Theres no escape

Unleash war
Unleash my wrath
Unleash revenge
Unleash my hell

No more scars of judgment
No more tolerance
No more compromise,
I stand in fire
Unleashing my revenge

Unleash war
Unleash my wrath
Unleash revenge
Unleash my hell

Fucked up you never learn
I've reached the point of no return
No I can't take it anymore
You're borrowing the blood I earned
From onslaught to oblivion
You're never taking me alive
Victimized, brutalized, terrorized, crucified, crucified...
In the heavy side of life we live
It's not how we chose,
But it is how it fucking is.

Unleash! Unleash! Unleash! Unleash!
