Holding off she breaks down in blue
Standing on that bridge and she's waiting,
Waiting for the holding off she breaks down in blue

Oh I'm gonna wait right here for what you wanna do
Baby the love hurts, don't talk to me like you do
The laziest ? don't love me, they don't talk to me like they used it
So I'm going up, and I'm not coming down
Not gonna sing unless my body's holding on
And I'm going and I'm not coming down
Not gonna sing unless my body's holding on
Not gonna sing unless my body's holding on
Not gonna sing unless my body's holding on
Holding off she breaks fallen face ?

Down on ? and she's waiting, waiting for you
Holding off she breaks down in blue
I'm gonna wait right here for you
Watcha wanna do

Baby the love hurts, don't talk to me like you do
The laziest ? don't talk to me, they don't love me like they used it
So I'm going up, and I'm not coming down
Not gonna sing unless my body's holding on
I'm going up, and I'm not coming down

Not gonna sing unless my body's holding on
Not gonna sing unless my body's holding on
Not gonna sing unless my body's holding on
Not gonna sing unless my body's holding on
Not gonna sing unless my body's holding on
Not gonna sing unless my body's holding on
