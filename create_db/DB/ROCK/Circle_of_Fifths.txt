Circle of fifths and the one you can miss
Can you keep the secrets well
Look at the past and the manners that lacked
Can you keep the secrets well
Can you keep them by yourself

Now in the morning, as the circle is forming
And the circle your drawing comes close
The circle of fifths grows

Back on the bus, oh, you must
Can you keep the secrets well
Sun on your pate and the fork on your plate
Can you keep the secrets well
Can you keep them by yourself

Now in the morning, as the circle is forming
And the circle your drawing comes close
The circle of fifths grows

When it's discreet then you're never complete
Can you keep the secrets well
Fifth in the traps and you know that you'll lapse
Can you keep the secrets well
Can you keep them for yourself

Now in the morning, as the circle is forming
And the circle your drawing comes close
The circle of fifths grows

Can you keep them for yourself
Can you keep yourself as well

Can you keep them for yourself
Can you keep yourself as well

Can you keep them for yourself
Can you keep yourself as well
