Here I am - waiting where you left me
My love was true
You felt you had to test me
I came to you when you needed all my love
Just you and I and the stars above
Thought I was the only one 

That was in your heart
But now I've found
You've been lying from the start
All these tears i have cried in vain
My heart was full of love
Now its full of shame

I can't sleep cause I got you on my mind
I hear your voice whisper in the dark sometimes
I toss & turn, my body misses you so
I never wanted anyone this much

Baby I love you (I love you)
What else can I do
When I know you feel like loving me too
Baby I love you (I love you)
What else can it be
When I feel for you the way you feel for me

Baby we can work it out if we'd only try
Just one more chance before we say goodbye
Don't let go I have to make you see
I'll stay here by your side
I will never leave

I can't sleep cause I got you on my mind
I hear your voice whisper in the dark sometimes
I toss & turn, my body misses you so
I never wanted anyone this much
