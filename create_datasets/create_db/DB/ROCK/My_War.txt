My war you're one of them 
You say that you're my friend 
But you're one of them 
You don't want to see me live 

You don't want me to give 
'Cause you're one of them 
My war you're one of them 
You say that you're my friend 

But you're one of them 
I might not know what a friend is 
All I know is what you're not 
'Cause you're one of them 

My war you're one of them 
You say that you're my friend 
But you're one of them 
I have a prediction, it lives in my brain 

It's with me every day, it drives me insane 
I feel it in my heart, that if I has a gun 
I feel it in my heart, 
I'd want to kill some 

I feel it in my heart, the end will come 
Come on! My war you're one of them 
You say that you're my friend 
But you're one of them 

Tell me that I'm wrong 
Try to sing me your ego song 
You're one of them 
My war you're one of them 

You say that you're my friend 
But you're one of them 
My War
