Each day every day
Colours in waves
Love and nights cause sparks
Tearing us apart

Street lights fading
Cuts my heart
Knowing that the time is past
Comes in waves that don't belong
To me they're silent

Fall back on what you've done
I'll be the only one
These colours before my eyes
I'll be forever colourblind
