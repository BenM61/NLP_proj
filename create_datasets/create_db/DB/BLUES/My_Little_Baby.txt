All my friends keep asking what do I see in you
Through their eyes you beauty doesn't show
Ooh, all they ask is justified looking through the naked eye
But through the eyes of my love I see
The inner beauty of you

That's why you're my little baby
That's why you're my little baby
I don't want love on the skin
It's got to come from deep within

That's why you're my little baby
My little baby
My heart controls my eyes
And your love I visualize, oh yeah!

All your so-called girl friends who compliment your clothes
Know that they're you mama's hand-me-downs
Oooh, the fashion world's turning so fast
You're still trying to catch the past.
But in my world of love your style
I know will always last.

That's why you're my little baby
That's why you're my little baby
I don't care what experts say
Our love is tailor-made

That's why you're my little baby
My my my my little baby
Like a brand-new ermine coat
You keep me warm as toast, little baby!

You know it's true, little baby
You know it's true, girl
You know it's true, little baby
You know it's true, babe

I'm sticking with you, little baby
I'm sticking with you, girl
I'm sticking with you, little baby

Always thrill me when you touch me
Honey, you thrill me when you kiss me, little baby, yeah
Oh, sweet baby, I've got to say I'm thankful that you're my little baby
My little baby
You fill me up with pride
Every time you're by by side, now now now now

Oh yeah, you're my little baby, my little baby
My little baby, I've got to say I'm thankful that you're my little baby
My little baby, my little baby
