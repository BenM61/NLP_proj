Verse 1: 

I'm beatin [BACKWARDS] against the [BACKWARDS] up out their boots 
Flame throwin their troops, they can't recoup from drinkin acid soup 
Spectacular, benacular, miraculous raw [BACKWARDS] 
Scooped off the concrete to make a hit 
Tearin [BACKWARDS] out the hinges, competition cringes 
In the trenches, killin for mere inches 
Word to mama, I tongue kiss a piranha 
Electricute a barricuda for tryin to bring the drama 
I get more ass than a toilet seat 
So put your ballerina shoes on and tiptoe down my [BACKWARDS] 
Your mother[BACKWARDS] deathwish will be soloist 
Are-double O-K-I-E you ain't stylish 
It's mother[BACKWARDS] arson from here to Parsons 
You're [BACKWARDS] dawson, it's murder, when I step in the door run 
For your mother[BACKWARDS] life, get ghost 
Or taste the toast and get your [BACKWARDS] hung on a goalpost 
Startin at'cha neck to check ya for respect 
Ya back get snapped, your lower spine gets wet 
Hips get ripped and then your thighs start to slide 
I'm up through [BACKWARDS]hole and [BACKWARDS] up your inside 

Hook:

Hopin to bring in to throw old rhyme to one of da fags 
Huh, I'm on my mother[BACKWARDS] game like dat 
I put it in your chest and make your heart go flat 
All the mother[BACKWARDS] tracks in the world can't save ya 
When I drop these chains on ya brain and enslave ya 
Once you was on a pedestal now ya gettin ridiculed 
[BACKWARDS] is critical, we're fightin at the pinnacle 
I'm burnin [BACKWARDS] like a cracker do a cross 
Ain't no three-in-a-row tic tac toe, this is a real flow boss 
Makin [BACKWARDS] understand my language 
Then they rap and vanish and camouflage the damage

Little shortys with big 40's talkin loud, actin proud 
BLAOW! Now ya chokin off a black cloud 
Rollin El's til your brain swells 
Inhale deep sleep and dust me off them old ass Rock The Bells 
You mother[BACKWARDS], you fruitcakes, you fakin jacks 
You [BACKWARDS] don't want it, I'm burnin up the wax 
I'm a trailblazin, gun totin, renegade 
Black ass New York [BACKWARDS] choppin like a blade 
Bullshinanigans, country ass mannequins
