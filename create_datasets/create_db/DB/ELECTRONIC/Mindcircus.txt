Falling in
Six hours from morning
And falling in
Sink me off to, sleep

So come along within, ahh, uhh
I think it's time to let me in
I'm tipping my foot very close to the edge, edge, ahh
Just a few more of your seconds
And I need for me to repair
To neatly stand and spin it around in my head, yeah, ahh

Can I please have some silence
Can I please have some silence (yeah)
Can I please have some silence
How 'bout some space

Almost
Ready to drift now
And I feel myself slipping inside you
Just a little bit further
Before something drags me back
So close, I thought I nearly had you there

I'm so tired
I gotta sleep
I wanna wake up from a dream
I've had enough
I need to sleep
I want to wake up without you, here

So come along within, ahh, uhh
I think it's time to let me in
I'm tipping my foot very close to the edge, edge, ahh
Just a few more of your seconds
And I need for me to repair
To neatly stand and spin it around in my head, yeah, ahh

Can I please have some silence
Can I please have some silence (yeah)
Can I please have some silence
How bout some space

Could I please, have some silence
Could I have some space
Could I have some space

Can I please have some silence
