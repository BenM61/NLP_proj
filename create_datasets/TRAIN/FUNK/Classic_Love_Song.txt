Me and you 
Gotta good thing going on
Like a classic love song, yeah (yeah yeah yeah)
All the time's we'd never thought we'd last this long
We're still going on strong
Like a classic love song

It's never a day that I don't think about your smiling face 
(Think about your smiling face)
And its never a day that I don't think about the things you say (ooh, ooh)
Cause all I know is I love you so (ooh)
And I just hope that our love will grow (ooh, ooh)
Inseparable, til we get old 
Keepin on
Like a song on the radio

Me and you 
Gotta good thing going on
Like a classic love song, yeah (yeah yeah yeah)
All the time's we'd never thought we'd last this long
We're still going on strong
Like a classic love song

And there's never a time 
That you don't supply the things I need
(Supply the things I need)
And there's never a time
That I don't appreciate your love for me
Cause boy you are 
A superstar
Near or far
You've got my heart
You play the part
Painting a love song 
Right from the start...

Me and you 
Gotta good thing going on
Like a classic love song, yeah (yeah yeah yeah)
All the time's we'd never thought we'd last this long
We're still going on strong
Like a classic love song

Me and you 
Gotta good thing going on
Like a classic love song, yeah (yeah yeah yeah)
All the time's we'd never thought we'd last this long
We're still going on strong
Like a classic love song

And I do love you too-- like a classic love song
And I do love you too-- like a classic love song
And I do love you too-- like a classic love song
And I do love you too-- like a classic love song
