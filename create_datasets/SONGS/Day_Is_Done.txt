And the sea's singing something new
When the day is done
When the full moon's wandering
Then the day is done
And it's love, love, love, love cause the day is done

Because I know you
Your name is someone 
Your name is someone 

Will you, won't you
When you know it's gone
It's like a punch drunk lullaby when the goings gone
And it's love, love, love
Once the night is gone
And it's love, love, love
Don't you know it's gone

Because I know you
Your name is someone
Your name is someone 
Your name is someone 
Your name is someone
