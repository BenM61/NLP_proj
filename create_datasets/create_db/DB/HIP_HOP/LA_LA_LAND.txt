I'm so over the game and living for the weekend
Let me outta this cage, so we can stop breathing
Ooh, f*ck it let them talk about us,
Let them talk about us,
Oh they wanna play rough,
Oohh f*ck it we never gon' stop
Move to California and never grow up,

You and me in La La La La La Land,
We'll be safe in La La La La La Land,

These Hollywood dreams started in the bedroom,
You were telling me I could be anything,
If only we could,
Run away to La La La La La Land,
You and Me in,
You and Me in,
You and Me in La La La La La Land,

The life I'm living right now,
Is never what I dreamed of,
So baby can we just drive,
'Til' we hit the ocean, just put the keys in,
Ooh, f*ck it let them talk about us,
Let them talk about us,
Oh they wanna play rough,
Oohh, f*ck it they don't know where we'd stop,
Move to California and never look back,

You and me in La La La La La Land,
We'll be safe in La La La La La Land,

These Hollywood dreams started in the bedroom,
You were telling me I could be anything,
If only we could,
Run away to La La La La La Land,
If only we could,
Find a way to La La La La La Land
You and Me in,
You and Me in,
You and Me in La La La La La Land,

If only we could
Run away to La La La La La Land,
If only we could,
Find a way to La La La La La Land
If only we could,
Fall asleep in La La La La La Land
