Für den Abend vielen Dank

Denn von deiner Hand wächst ein Bein mir in den Himmel

Als ich es fand war es verändert

Ich sag' wie
Es war hoch wie nie
You say: no
No
No
Honey
Can't you see it is destiny

It is all for rock
It will turn to knock
Bring your hips to the top
Do the bebop
You say: no
No
No

Show me the way you move your body
Night into day

Why should I wait for you to love me

Don't be too late the way to make it happen

Body next to body
Turn the pain to pleasure

I want to know if you are the one for me
Yeah
Body next to body
Searching for the treasure

The magic in the mystery
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah!

Sooner or later you must leave the theater

And you have to no home
Maybe yov're alone
Do the bang-bang-boogie
Stand up
Turn the boogie

You say: no
No
No
Honey
Can't yau see it is destiny

It is all for rock
It will turn to knock

Bring your hips to the top
Do fhe bebop

You say: no
No
No

I am the one you need forever
Second to none -
Say
Say
Say

Life on the run
We stay together whatever comes

Today we take our chances

Body next to body
Turn the pain to pleasure
  
Body next to body
Turn the pain to pleasure

Body next to body
Turn the pain to pleasure

Fancy
Fancy lady
Tell me that you're ready

Tell me that you're ready to break through
Yeah
Yeah
Fancy
Fancy lady
Tell me you already

Tell me you already broke walls of silence
Hey
Hey!
