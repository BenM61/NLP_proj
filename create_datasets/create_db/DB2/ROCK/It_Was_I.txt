You're telling everybody I'm the one
To blame for all the wrong that you have done.
The day that you walked out and left, didn't say goodbye.
Who was left alone to sit and cry?
It was I; it was I.

I gave you all the love I ever had,
The only things I got from you were bad,
The times you didn't show up,
The times you didn't call,
Who was left alone with it all?
It was I; it was I.

My love was always yours to treasure and to hold.
If you let a love go by, it will soon grow cold.
Temptation is too strong to hide,
Are you really satisfied
With our love the way it is?
Let me tell you how it is.

Please come back and try to start anew
I know that it's the proper thing to do,
Darlin' if we make up
I know we'll never break up.
Then I know it's only me and you,
Me and you.
