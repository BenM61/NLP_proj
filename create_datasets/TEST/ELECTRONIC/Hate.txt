Hate
Relax your stare
It's laughing in my face
My foes beware
I'm tired of losing grace
The child's not there
The priest is losing faith
Defile my care
And stumble to the flames
People crying
People crying
People crying
People crying
My confusion
My confusion
Are there illusions?
There illusions?
Hate
The dice won't lose
They've everything to gain
Devout prepare
The stones along my grave
People crying
People crying
People crying
People crying
My confusion
My confusion
Are there illusions?
There illusions?
Hate
Don't say a word if I've been away too long
I found out it's wrong
I found out I don't need hate
I don't need hate
