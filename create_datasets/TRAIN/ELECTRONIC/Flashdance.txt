He doesn't mean a thing to me,
Just another pretty face to see,
He's all over town, knocking them down yeah honey,
And I'd never let him next to me,

He's the kind of guy who thinks he's smart,
He's the type that always looks the part,
He's on the make, he's on the take,
And I'd never let him touch my heart,

He didn't mean to catch my eye,
Well he's lucky he just walked on by,
'cause he hasn't met a girl like me
Are you kidding?
Well I'd tell him that i'd rather die...
