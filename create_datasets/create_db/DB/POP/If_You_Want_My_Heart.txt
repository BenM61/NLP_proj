Baby if you want my heart
First, you've gotta gone through the doors
I know there's none love lasts
I'll start all over

Love is hard
We won't forget that part
But love is how we
We can be the best to each other
Once in a while
You might go out alone
And if you do
And I don't wanna love you

Baby if you want my heart
First, you've gotta come through the door
I know there's no love lasts
I'll wanna start all over

Once in a little while
You might go out alone
And if you do
At night I send all my love to you

Every day, baby
Every way, I love you
There's no little thing I can do
Every way, baby
Every day, I love you more, I know you know

Baby if you want my heart
First, you've gotta come through the door
I know there's no love lasts
But I'll start all over
