Komo Sambe Kong Kong!
Woo wooo woo

He lived in the jungle where he was born the king
His great strength made him lord of everything
No creature crossed his path and lived for long
His name, so legend tells us, was King Kong
His height was never measured but was great
The jungle shook beneath his mighty weight
His arms were muscled, sturdy as a tree
His chest was thick and wide as it could be

Komo Sambe, King Kong

Komo Sambe

He didn't dance or party
He spoke at times, but hardly
One woman heard his love call
But he was too big and too tall

whooo woo woo woo woo
Whoo woo wo woo woooo

One day while Kong was sleepin' on his back
A tyrannosaurus launched a sneak attack
They fought, first Kong went down then up again
The fight went on, no one knew who would win
Kong reached and seized the monster with both hands
And summoned all his strength at his command
He stretched the creature's mouth to lift (?) the split (?)
Then like a child began to play with it
He beat his hairy chest and looked around
Five miles away they heard his roaring sound

From everyone he knew he got respect
Whoever failed to give it he'd correct he, he, haw
No creature crossed his path and lived for long
His name, so legend tells us, was King Kong
