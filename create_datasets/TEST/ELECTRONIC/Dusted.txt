A million guys they want free style
There will be no blows not freestyle
This style is not free
This style is expensive, alright
Old type jokes
Love me self I possessed
More like to death
Yigga yaw
Yes sir mister upfront crutch
My level is seldom seen
Few and far between
Dem folks they couldn't douse my cane
Learn to the mean
For brad pick 'e had
Slapped in the face
Strapped down
I get sunset to sunset
With no sweat yet
Cooin' our fret
By the doves them hold me
I'm picky with precision
I've made my decision then
Death itself can't hold us down
But the seeds of progress them done get sow My talk back
Broke the cane in four
Face flat to the floor
But then from the stress
To commence with a brand new sense o' sell You old Zulu
Comin' to
Tokyo train stop
Hipper to the crew
Down right crim and we dusted
Guitar
Down right crim and we dusted
Guitar
Tougher than my cuts
And my baby like flex
But I won't waste my breath
I let action speak
Though this beat stands taller
Than the peak of Everest
I visualize and breach the progress
Then high pork chest
A bit right to it
The choice is there is no choice
But to pursue it
Soul undermine
Mind on the sole
My struggle remains
But my insight grows
Down right crim and we dusted
Guitar
Down right crim and we dusted
Guitar
Down right crim and we dusted
Guitar
Down right crim and we dusted
Against the grain
We shall remain
Huh yeah steamin' on
Soon become a new boss
Lord know the sun ain't cut
Gain enough glove
Gain enough crowd
Move in tight
Belly white fright
In the sight set
To step to the height
Left in the field now
Lookin' good
Went to this wayward bounce
'Bout to renounce
Some steadfast
Lookin' my way
I heed not my hearsay
I put my trust in my
Own possessions of knowledge itself
Down right crim and we dusted
Guitar
Down right crim and we dusted
Guitar
Down right crim and we dusted
Guitar
Down right crim and we dusted
Get yourself into hard love
Guitar
The power of the inner eye
Huh
Leds the strength of we
Go
War
Bounce to the next round
Motion splendid
It bring quality
Now I'm on four sides, see
We dump club a tip
Motion splendid
It bring quality
Now I'm on four sides, see
We dump club a tip
Four sides
Four sides
Four sides
