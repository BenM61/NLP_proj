Your disco, your disco, your disco needs you 
Your disco, your disco, your disco needs you
Your disco, your disco, your disco needs you
Your disco, your disco, your disco needs you

Desperately seeking someone, willing to travel
You're lost in conversation and useless at Scrabble
Happiness will never last,
Darkness come's to kick your ass

So let's dance through all our fears
War is over for a bit
The whole world shoud be moving do your part
Cure a lonely heart

Your disco, your disco, your disco needs you 
Your disco, your disco, your disco needs you

We're sold on vanity, but that's so see through
Take your body to the floor, your disco needs you
From Soho to Singapore
From the mainlands to the shore

So let's dance through all our fears
War is over for a bit
You're a slave to the rhythm do your part
Cure a lonely heart

Oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Ah ha
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Ah ha

Ah
So let's dance through all our fears
War is over for a bit
The whole world should be moving do your part
Cure a lonely heart

Your disco, your disco, your disco needs you 
Your disco, your disco, your disco needs you
Your disco, your disco, your disco needs you
Your disco, your disco, your disco needs, you!
