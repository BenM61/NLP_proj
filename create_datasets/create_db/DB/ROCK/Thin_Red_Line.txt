The hands of time have spoken for the chosen ones
Cold steel glistens in the dawning sun
Destiny and claidemaugh that embraces me
All here to sacrifice for victory

Hidden in the shadows where the cold wind comes
A mist queen dances for her fallen sons
Over and over
Her shadow falls over me

Remember no retreat, for here you die where you stand
It's chance that brings the Rory's to this foreign land
The crimson and the claidemaugh make you strangers to fear
A thin red streak tipped with a line of steel

Shadows fall over me
All for the thin red line
All for the thin red line

Now the battles over, Kedikoi can cry
For all the gallant hillmen she's seen fought and die
Red is for the heroes green is for the brave
Soldiers would you leave me with no souls to save

Shadows fall over me
All for the thin red line
All for the thin red line
All for the thin red line 

Oh oh oh oh oh
