Cabbing it uptown
You're moving it uptown
You taxi it uptown uptown 

And you're moving it southwest 
You're cabbing it uptown
You're moving up sideways sideways 

And you're cabbing it uptown uptown 
Cabbing it uptown 
Your business friend
Your business friend's Australian
And when he comes it's Gotterdamerung! 

But you're cabbing it uptown
You're moving up south now
You're moving it uptown uptown
Sideways sideways 

Main strips! Main strips! 
People going, people going
Moving it uptown 

And locked in the door bins
Slowly slowly 

Jump in! Jump in! 
You're cabbing it uptown uptown 
But you know the best, Dan
I dunno where I am
I feel like crying 

But cabbing it uptown
You're moving up sideways
Moving up slowly
You're cabbing it uptown 

(Taxi!) 
You'd better cab it up slowly 
Moving in circles
A Shepherd's Bush man
Eats from a can
He taxi it southwest southwest
He moving it uptown uptown 

Uptown Uptown 
You'd better cab it up slowly
You'd better taxi it slowly
You'd better cab it slowly
You'd better cab it up 

Jump in! Jump in!
Michael! Michael!
