Motherfucking legend
Motherfucking legend
Even if I die, living legend
Look at my reflection
Ain't no second guessing
Always be a legend
A motherfucking legend
Motherfucking legend
Used to whip a lexus
I can die right now, still a legend
Look at my reflection
Ain't no second guessing
Born to be a legend
A motherfucking legend

Nineteen ninety six, I beat a 187 (murder was the case)
Eigthy million sold, and I ain't check the records
Checked a couple rappers, told 'em not to test me
Ask me who am I? Motherfucking legend
Fifty bitches naked
Nike ain't my preference
Khaki with the chucks
Now look how they dressing
Perfecting my profession
Someone call the reverend (nate dogg nigga)
Bury me alive, living legend

Motherfucking legend
Motherfucking legend
Even if I die, living legend
Look at my reflection
Ain't no second guessing
Always be a legend
A motherfucking legend

Look, big dog, six broads, don't matter to me
You knew niggas look madder than me
Came up with the doc, been around the world with 'pac
Don't compare another rapper to me
When I came and kicked them buildings over
Swear I always knew I'd never be the same
Was born to be a motherfucking legend
I ain't never do it for no fucking fame

Motherfucking legend
You know what I'm repping
Twenty million, twenty years ago
Cuh, you was like seven
You ain't gotta like it
Bitch you gon' respect it (respek on my name)
Look me in my eye
Motherfucking legend

Motherfucking legend
Motherfucking legend
Even if I die, living legend
Look at my reflection
Ain't no second guessing
Always be a legend
A motherfucking legend
Motherfucking legend
Used to whip a lexus
I can die right now, still a legend
Look at my reflection
Ain't no second guessing
Born to be a legend
A motherfucking legend

Mix purple with the yella
Kobe with vanessa
Did it doggy style
Leg up on the dresser
Look at my reflection
Motherfucking legend
Even when I die
