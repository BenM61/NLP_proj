Expensive liquor, forget that
Cheap beer and a bong in my backpack
[?] charges, hell no
Everyone's allowed in the motherfucking house show
Keg stands, hell yeah
Then line it up like the kids at a state fair
You wanted chaos, well here you go
Let's [?] so hard that the whole world knows

Let's turn it up tonight
Then pass out on the floor
[?], look at the score

You think you, you think you could take me on
Step up, step up to the plate now
I am, I am a legend in the making
This is my destiny

You wanna sing along and get high
[?] up to the front and take this mic
[?] I hope so
If you want a challenge, let's go toe to toe
You want to break shit, I don't know
This isn't my house so anything goes
Woah yeah, hell yeah
Take it over the top
When will the cops show up
(Come on, let me hear you)

You think you, you think you could take me on
Step up, step up to the plate now
I am, I am a legend in the making
This is my destiny

Woah, yeah

You think you, you think you could take me on
Step up, step up to the plate now
You think you, you think you could take me on
Step up, step up to the plate now
I am, I am a legend in the making
This is my destiny
You think you, you think you could take me on
Step up, step up to the plate now
I am, I am a legend in the making
This is my destiny
