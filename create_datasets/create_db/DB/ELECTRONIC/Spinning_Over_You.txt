My head is spinning over you
I think I'm losing my defenses
and when I'm standing next to you
I feel the failure of my senses

You keep me locked under your spell
I think I'm losing my direction
and when I hear you say my name
my body falls under sedation

And I'm trying and trying and trying
and I'm trying God knows I'm trying
and I'm trying to take you out of my mind

My head is spinning over you
Spinning over you

I'm getting shivers in my skin
your voice is feeding my obsession
and when you're standing close to me
I feel I'm trapped in this temptation

And I'm trying, and trying and trying
and I'm trying God knows I'm trying
And I'm trying to take you out of my mind

My head is spinning over you
My head is spinning over you

And I'm trying, and trying and trying
and I'm trying God knows I'm trying
And I'm trying to take you out of my mind

My head is spinning over you
My head is spinning over you
Spinning over you
My head is spinning over you
