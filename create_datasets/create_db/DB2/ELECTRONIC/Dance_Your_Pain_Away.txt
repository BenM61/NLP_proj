Nothing you can do
Damage's been done
You caught him in the restroom
With another one
When everybody's looking at you
Crying's not the right thing to do
Don't run for the door
Get back on the floor
Don't give them what they're waiting for

D-d-d-dance your pain away
D-d-d-dance your pain away
Let there be rumors
Pay no attention
Lock your tears inside and show some pride
D-d-d-dance your pain away
D-d-d-dance your pain away
Create an illusion
Cause some confusion
Lock your tears inside and show some pride

Pictures in your mind
Tearing at your heart
You're breaking into pieces
But you can't fall apart
When everybody's looking at you
Better shine the whole night through
Don't run for the door
Get back on the floor
Don't give them what they're waiting for

D-d-d-dance your pain away
D-d-d-dance your pain away
Let there be rumors
Pay no attention
Lock your tears inside and show some pride
D-d-d-dance your pain away
D-d-d-dance your pain away
Create an illusion
Cause some confusion
Lock your tears inside and show some pride

Nothing, he got nothing, he got nothing, he got nothing on you, on you
Nothing, he got nothing, he got nothing, he got nothing on you, on you

Nothing you can do
Damage's been done
Don't give them what they're waiting for

D-d-d-dance your pain away
D-d-d-dance your pain away
Let there be rumors
Pay no attention
Lock your tears inside and show some pride
D-d-d-dance your pain away
D-d-d-dance your pain away
Create an illusion
Cause some confusion
Lock your tears inside and show some pride

Dance your pain away
Dance your pain away
Dance your pain away
D-d-d-dance your pain away
Dance your pain away
Dance your pain away
Dance your pain away
D-d-d-dance your pain away
