If your liver starts to jump
And your heart begins to thump
Man that's all
Another mule is kickin' your stall

Now if your girl stay out all night
Don't you get mad and start a fight
Cause man that's all
Another mule is kickin' your stall

Now if you come home and your food ain't cooked
And she give you a dirty look
Man that's all
Another mule is kickin' your stall

If your liver starts to jump
And your heart begins to thump
Man that's all
Another mule is kickin' your stall

Now if your girl stay out all night
Don't you get mad and start a fight
Cause man that's all
Another mule is kickin' your stall

Now if you come home and your food ain't cooked
And she give you a dirty look
Man that's all
Another mule is kickin' your stall
