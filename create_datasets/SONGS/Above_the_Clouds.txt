Love lifts us up
Love lifts us up

Remember the pain we put eachother through
Remember the tears you cried, I cried too
Remember how close we came, to giving up
Remember the heartaches that were destroyed
Remember the arguments, we employed
Remember the lines we drew, and the lines we crossed

If we had known it would be so hard, 
Would we have set out on this road together
Now when I look into your eyes I can see forever

We're flying above the clouds, so beautiful & clear
We're flying above the clouds, I can see happiness from here

Love lifts us up
Love lifts us up

Remember the silence living in the dark
Remember the desperation in my heart
Remember how close we came, to giving up

We were caught up in our storm, I didn't think that we would make it
We have only stood our grounds, now the storm is breaking

We're flying above the clouds, so beautiful & clear
We're flying above the clouds, I can see happiness from here

Sweet love, to a higher ground
Love lifts us up
Love lifts us up

If we had known it would be so hard, 
Would we have set out on this road together
Now when I look into your eyes, I can see forever

We're flying above the clouds, so beautiful & clear
We're flying above the clouds, I can see happiness from here

We're flying so beautiful love lifts us up
There is so much happiness don't ever stop
