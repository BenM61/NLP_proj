I've had my share of life's ups and downs
God's been good to me, and the downs have been few
I would guess you can say, God has blessed me
But there's never been a time in my life, he didn't bring me through

If anyone should ever write, my life story
For whatever reason there might be
You'd be there, between each line of pain and glory

Jesus is the best thing that ever happened
Jesus is the best thing that ever happened
Jesus is the best thing that ever happened to me

If anyone should ever write, my life story
For whatever reason there might be
One day, I was lost but Jesus found me

Jesus is the best thing that ever happened
Jesus is the best thing that ever happened
Jesus is the best thing that ever happened to me

If anyone should ever write, my life story
For whatever reason there might be
I was on my way to hell, but Jesus lifted me

Jesus is the best thing that ever happened
Jesus is the best thing that ever happened
Jesus is the best thing that ever happened to me

Jesus is the best thing that ever happened
Jesus is the best thing that ever happened
Jesus is the best thing that ever happened to me

Jesus is the best thing that ever happened
Jesus is the best thing that ever happened
Jesus is the best thing that ever happened to me
