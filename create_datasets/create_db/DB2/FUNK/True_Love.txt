I'm always thinking of you
So I thought I'd let you know
I hope I'm not intruding
By telling the world I love you so

I thought I'd get to know you
What your love is about
I'm always thinking of you
'Cause you live inside my dreams

Ohh, search the world to find your love into two
How long have I been looking for you
I've never searched so hard in my life
To find someone

True love is hard to find
Someone to treat you right
And if true love you need
Then you will find in me

I hope that you will measure
The contents of my heart
I hope that you will treasure
The way that I feel for you

And if you chance you'll understand
The sentiments of a man, yeah
I know you won't be curious
'Cause my love will keep you walking by

It's true I search the world to find a love like you
I've been looking in a sky full of stars
That you are, just to fine
My only peace of mind

True love is hard to find
Someone to treat you right
And if true love you need
Then you will find in me
