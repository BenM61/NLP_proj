My job's calling me and I sure need the dough
Life won't wait and I'll earn my fate
My time's now, I need to go

Nothing going to come my way if I sit here and wait
Nothing going to come my way if I sit here and wait
No time no time to sit back and relax
To much to do to sit back and relax
No time no time to sit back and relax
To much to do to sit back and relax

Traveled miles of road in a box with four wheels
No plans just a load of will to see me through

Nothing going to come my way if I sit here and wait
Nothing going to come my way if I sit here and wait
No time no time to sit back and relax
To much to do to sit back and relax
No time no time to sit back and relax
To much to do to sit back and relax
