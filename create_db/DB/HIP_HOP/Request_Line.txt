DJ please
Pick up your phone
I'm on the request line

Baby, baby, ba-ba baby baby
Baby, Baby, alright all night

I know it's better when the rhythm works together
With the beat in your soul
Did I ever tell you
How you make me feel
Every night you're on the control

So come on daddy won't you take it away
I know I call your line every day
I'm dialing five, five, five, zero, four, twenty-nine
So that I can hear you say, hey

[Chorus]
Hey, baby boo
Just tell me what
I can play for you, hey
You're right on time
You just got through the request line
Baby, baby, ba-ba baby, baby

Baby every single day
I call you, I call you
Baby every single night
Alright now, alright

Remember this voice calling you
It's been a while so how you been, oh

And catch the vinyl as it's spinning around, yeah
