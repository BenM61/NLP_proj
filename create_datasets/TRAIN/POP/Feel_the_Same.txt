You got to know (yeah yeah), I want to show (yeah)
Took a minute to realize, but when you're not there by my side
It just feels cold (yeah yeah), and the nights are long (yeah)
So sick of chasing highs, so tired of wondering why

Why I let go, let go, let go
When you're the only one I wanna hold
La-la-la let go, let go, let go
I'm left wondering why, why love don't feel the same

I've been up and all over the globe
Tryna find someone special like you
But without you, baby, love don't feel the same
I've been taking up all of my time
Trying to get someone else on my mind
'Cause without you, baby, love don't feel the same

When you're not with me (yeah yeah) you're all I see (yeah)
In every single place, in every single face
Oh what have I gotta do 'cause I ain't getting over you
So sick of chasing those highs, so tired of wondering why

Why I let go, let go, let go
When you're the only one I wanna hold
La-la-la let go, let go, let go
I'm left wondering why, why love don't feel the same

I've been up and all over the globe
Tryna find someone special like you
But without you, baby, love don't feel the same
I've been taking up all of my time
Trying to get someone else on my mind
'Cause without you, baby, love don't feel the same

Hooked on you and, girl, it won't stop
No, it won't stop
Ain't nobody got what you got
Got what you got
Hooked on you and, girl, it won't stop
No, it won't stop
Ain't nobody got what you got
My love don't feel the same

I've been up and all over the globe
Tryna find someone special like you
But without you, baby, love don't feel the same
I've been taking up all of my time
Trying to get someone else on my mind
'Cause without you, baby, love don't feel the same

I've been up and all over the globe
Tryna find someone special like you
But without you, baby, love don't feel the same
I've been taking up all of my time
Trying to get someone else on my mind
'Cause without you, baby, love don't feel the same

I've been up and all over the globe
Tryna find someone special like you
But without you, baby, love don't feel the same
I've been taking up all of my time
Trying to get someone else on my mind
'Cause without you, baby, love don't feel the same

Eh
You know love don't feel the same
