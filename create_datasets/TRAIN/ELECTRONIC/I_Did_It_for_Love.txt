I did it for love.
I did it for love.
I did it for love.
I did it for love.

What's hard for me,
I saw your game, but yet, and still you got me,
You touched the deepest part of me,
You got my heart, it's jumpin'.
I told you all of my secrets, didn't see betrayal,
One year, two months, and now it's over,
Didn't think we'd fail.

Lovin' you is causin' me to change,
And it hurts so bad, it don't feel the same.
And now my friends are askin' me what did I do,
I done hurt myself over loving you.

I, I, I, I, did it, did it, did it for love.
I, I, I, I, did it, did it, did it for love.
I, I, I, I, did it, did it, did it for love.
I, I, I, I, did it, did it, did it for love.

I know that I did you wrong.
Please forgive me, baby girl, I'm sorry.
You know that you did me wrong.
Why you cryin', baby girl, I'm sorry.
I know that I did you wrong.
Heaven knows I don't mean to hurt nobody.
You know that you did me wrong.
Let me take this time to say I'm sorry.

Lovin' you is causin' me to change,
And it hurts so bad, it don't feel the same.
And now my friends are askin' me what did I do,
I done hurt myself over loving you.
Oh, I

I, I, I, I, did it, did it, did it for love.
I, I, I, I, did it, did it, did it for love.
I, I, I, I, did it, did it, did it for love.
I, I, I, I, did it, did it, did it for love.

I had some intentions, baby, but not on hurting you.
(I I I)I wanna make it up to you.
Did you see it in my heart?
I can't trust it anymore.
(I I I)I wanna make it up to you.
(I I I)I wanna make it up to you.
Did you see it in my heart?
I can't trust it anymore.

I, I, I, I, did it, did it, did it for love.
I, I, I, I, did it, did it, did it for love.
I, I, I, I, did it, did it, did it for love.
I, I, I, I, did it, did it, did it for love.

I, I, I, I, did it, did it, did it for love.
I, I, I, I, did it, did it, did it for love.
I, I, I, I, did it, did it, did it for love.
I, I, I, I, did it, did it, did it for love.

Did it for love
Did it for love
Did it for love
Did it, did it, did it for love
