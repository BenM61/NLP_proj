Every time I see you comin' a walkin' down the street
Oh I get a funny feelin' and my heart skips a beat
I hear a little bell ring (ring-a-ling ring-a-lig) I hear the lovebird sing
The way you rock when you walk just makes me bubble crazy talk
Pa pa do do do do wap pi pi a di de di de woa
Wi pi pa pa pa pa do crazy talk means I love you
Crazy talk crazy talk wap a di di di di do
Crazy talk crazy talk crazy talk means I love you

Every time your look love it's a hope of me
I could climb my highest mountain and I could sail the deepest sea
I hear a little bell ring
