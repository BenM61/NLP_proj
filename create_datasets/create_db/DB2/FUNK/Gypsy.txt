I wake up weeping from my sleeping den
Oh, I wanna fall asleep again
But the memory of her burning skin
Uummhh, keeps me yearning
You know I?m yearning?

Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, you gypsy, you heartbreaking gypsy
Gypsy will you ever come home

Another drink, another cigarette
Lord, I?d try anything to forget
But the memory of her burning touch
Uummh, just keeps on returning, just keeps returning?

Oh, oh, oh, oh you gypsy, you heartbreaking gypsy
I said gypsy won?t you ever come home

Who's gonna kiss my eyes, my eyes, my eyes, gypsy like you do
Who's gonna tell me lies, sweet lies, sweet lies 
And make me believe they?re true?

I miss her morning kiss when I wake up?
I look and I see her face there in my coffee cup?
I didn't know what a-loneliness was?
Baby, baby, baby, I said I'm learning?
You know I'm learning?

Oh, oh, oh, oh you gypsy, you heartbreaking gypsy
I said gypsy won?t you ever come home
Listen to me darling, I said a-gypsy, I said a heartbreaking gypsy
I said, a-darling, won't you ever come home
Say, I'm a-lonely, I'm a-lonely, a-little 
I said a-gypsy, I said a heartbreaking gypsy
I said baby just, just come on home
Hear me when I said, I said now oh gypsy
Gypsy, gypsy, heartbreaking gypsy?
Gypsy won't you ever come home?
