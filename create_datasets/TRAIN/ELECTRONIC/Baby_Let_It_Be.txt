Baby let it be, let it be 
Baby, baby let it be, let it be 
Baby, baby let it be, let it be 
Baby, baby let it be 

Come on baby let it be 

Tell me that you know what you're doing 
Show me that you keep control 
You say that's the way you're choosing 
Cause you want to free your soul 

But you do what you do and you're playing with fire 
Don't burn your hands as you're taking a chance 
You're on a trip to get higher and higher 
Baby can't you see 

Guess you think you can't be wrong 
Feeling cool, feeling strong 
In the long run you will loose 
And that's not the way to choose 
Change your style and turn back 
Live your life on the right track 
Life is precious don't you break it 
If you get a chance then take it 

But you do what you do and you're playing with fire 
Don't burn your hands as you're taking a chance 
You're on a trip to get higher and higher 
Baby can't you see
