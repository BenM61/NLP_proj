Here is a rich boy, a bit of a brat
To him life's just a fling
Phi, beta, kappa and first in his class
He's treated just like a king

And he says, "I'm not sure what it is I must have
So I guess I'll just take everything"

He's just ambitious
He's not a bad man
He's just ambitious
He's not a bad man
Just ambitious, woah, yeah just ambitious

Here is a young girl, born down and out
Locked up in jail when she was ten, yeah
Now in the courtroom, she's got a bit of doubt
Sits on the judge side of the bench

She's just ambitious
She's not a bad girl
She's just ambitious
She's not a bad girl
Just ambitious, woah, yeah just ambitious

Here is a wild man who thirsts for a fight
And his cool streak gets him by
All these four-letter words in his mind
Here is a man who'll survive

He's just ambitious
He's just a wild man
He's just ambitious
He's just a wild man
Just ambitious, woah, yeah just ambitious

Here is a wild man who thirsts for a fight
Just ambitious
Always a four-letter word in his mind
Just ambitious

Don't you know, I'm just ambitious
I'm not a bad man, just ambitious
I'm not a bad man, just ambitious
Woah, yeah, just ambitious

I'm not a bad man, just ambitious
I'm not a bad man, just ambitious
I'm not a bad man, just ambitious
I'm not a bad man, just ambitious, yeah, yeah
