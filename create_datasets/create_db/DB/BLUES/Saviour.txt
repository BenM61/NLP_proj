Saviour, saviour
Saviour, saviour

Gotta get to the river, gotta make it to the other side
Gotta get to the river, gotta make it to the other side
Take me to the river, help me get to the other side
Get me to the river, gonna make it to the other side

F*ck my saviour

Saviour, saviour
Saviour, saviour

When I'm breaking and I'm shaking and I'm looking for the riverside
Shaking on this faking, help me get to the other side
When I'm breaking and I'm shaking, trying to get to the other side
Take me to the river, come on, take me to the other side

Fuckin' saviour
Fuckin' saviour

Help me

Saviour, saviour
Saviour, saviour

I gotta get to the river, gotta make it to the other side
Nobody knows where the riverside will run
Somebody saw the saviour down by the river
Somebody tell me when the saviour comes

Where, where, where
Where is that saviour?
Where, where, beware

Where is that saviour?
Where is that saviour?

Saviour, saviour
Saviour, saviour

Fuckin', fuckin', saviour
