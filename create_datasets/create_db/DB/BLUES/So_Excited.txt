Oh, I'm so excited, think about you all the time
Yes, I can't wait to see you baby
You really best of my mind
You're so fine, wanna hold you all the time

Oh, when, when you touch me baby, tears of joy I'm crying
Oh, and when you hold me chills run up and down my spine
You're so fine, think about you all the time

Yes, I'm so excited, I met peace with the world
Oh, can this love be real, I'm talking about my new, new love
You're so fine baby, wanna love you all the time

Hey, I'm so excited, don't know what you're doing myself
Oh, I'm so happy baby, don't need nobody else
You're so fine baby, think about you all the time

Yes, when I look in your eyes, you put me in a trance
Oh, I just shake all over baby, oh, I feel like I wanna dance
You're so fine baby, wanna hold you all the time

How can this be a dream, can this really happen to me
Oh, surely loved at last, seems like a fantasy
You re so fine baby, wanna hold you all the time

Oh, I thought I've been in love, so many, many times
Oh, but this new love, has really messed up my mind
You're so fine, think about you all the time

You're so nice and lovin', everything you do is right
I just can't wait, I can't wait baby
Can't wait for you to hold me tight
You're so fine, wanna hold you all the time
