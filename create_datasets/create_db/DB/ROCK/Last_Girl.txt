I want to be like your last girl
'Cause she's got looks that drive you all down
Loved the way she wears her makeup
She would be so nice to wake up to
She's so sweet
And she's so pretty
Even more than me

I want to be like your last girl
She's the sun in your cold world and
I am just a dying flower
I don't hold the timer in my eyes
She's so cool
And the boys all drool
When she leaves with you

Maybe I'm just feeling like
I don't have a chance this time
'Cause I don't have a chance this time, I swear

Why would you still want to be with me?
She's got everything you'll ever need
Why would you still want to be with me?
She's got everything

I want to be like your last girl
She's got hips that hypnotize
She could keep you occupied
I know she still hangs in your mind these days
She's so fine
And she's all things nice
Does it drive you wild?

Maybe I'm just feeling like
I don't have a chance this time
'Cause I don't have a chance this time, I swear

Why would you still want to be with me?
She's got everything you'll ever need
Why would you still want to be with me?
She's got everything
Why would you still want to be with me?
She's got everything
