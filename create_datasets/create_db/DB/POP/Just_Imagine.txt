Just imagine
That he loves me dearly.
Just imagine
That I'm here sincerely.
I'm pretending
That he's sending
Love note ending
"I love you!"

Seems that he's there
As the day is closing;
On his knees there,
I hear him proposing!
He's not present,
Still it's pleasant,
Just imagine that it's true.

Seems that he's there
As the day is closing;
On his knees there,
I hear him proposing!
Till I win you,
I'll continue
To imagine that it's true.
