Pull me from the toaster
Straight into the roaster 
Fill my head with the stuff 
Brightest dreams are made of
Bringing me down again
Bringing me down again
Bringing me down again
Bringing me down again 
Duh
Promising the big guns
Reward when the light comes 
Screaming from the damage done 
Screaming from the damage done 
Bringing me down again
Bringing me down again
Bringing me down again
Bringing me down again 
Duh 
Butter me up, butter me up 
Butter me up, butter me up 
Butter me up, butter me up 
Butter me up, butter me up 
Butter me up like I know you will 
Cover it up like I know you will 
Better yourself like I know you will 
Breaking the trust like you always will
Be good for it, you never will 
Be good for it, you never will 
Be good for it, you never will 
Be good for it, you never will 
Butter me up, butter me up 
Butter me up, butter me up 
Butter me up, butter me up 
Butter me up, butter me up 
Duh 
So you think you got the best
Thought I was like all the rest 
Reaping from the damage done 
Reaping from the damage done
Bringing me down again 
Bringing me down again 
Bringing me down again 
Bringing me down again
Duh
