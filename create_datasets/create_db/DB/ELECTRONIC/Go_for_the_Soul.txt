It takes a fool to keep this fire burning
It takes a fool to love this much
It takes a fool to keep up with this yearning
So God bless fools like us

I believe
We've got nothing to lose in this fight
And I feel
I grow stronger with you by my side

Go for the soul and get into the motion
Get on your feet and dance with me
We've got the music, fire and devotion
Go, go, go, go for the soul
Go, go, go, go for the soul

It takes a dream to stay above the surface
It takes a dream to live and breathe
And when I dream I dream about your face
You're the one that makes me bleed

I believe
We've got all that it takes to come true
And I feel
I grow stronger each day I'm with you

Go for the soul and get into the motion
Get on your feet and dance with me
We've got the music, fire and devotion
Go, go, go, go for the soul
Go, go, go, go for the soul
Go, for the soul

In your hearts, in your minds, in your eyes
Let me drown, let me stay in your life

Go for the soul and get into the motion
Get on your feet and dance with me
We've got the music, fire and devotion
Go, go, go, go for the soul
Go, go, go, go for the soul
Go, go, go, go for the soul
