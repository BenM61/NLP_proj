Day after day
I see you slipping into darkness and I wanna know
Are you okay
Or are you looking for another place that you can go
For good advice
Or just a friendly face that you can pour your heart out to
And pay the price
To find the difference between something old and something new

And when I sing my song
Tell me if, sweet girl, it makes you cry
Cuts you deep and tears you apart
And will you let love try?
No, you say you're not that strong
And you don't need another broken heart
No, you don't need another broken heart

Night after night
I feel the dawning of a morning coming around the bend
Are you alright
Or are you feeling that your future's coming to an end?
Keep hanging on
The life you're leading's taking you to places never known
You could be wrong
Maybe your soul is pleading for a chance to be alone

And when I sing my song
Tell me if, sweet girl, it makes you cry
Cuts you deep and tears you apart
And will you let love try?
No, you say you're not that strong
And you don't need another broken heart
No, you don't need another broken heart

Broken heart
Do you want another love affair to start?
You don't need
You don't need another
Another broken heart

Time after time
Take a moment and decide just where you want to be
Draw the line
Seize the day and find the future that you want to see
It must be hard
To leave a life you've loved and wanted with your heart and soul
So find a love
To help you deal with all the torment taking such a toll

And when I sing my song
Tell me if, sweet girl, it makes you cry
Cuts you deep and tears you apart
And will you let love try?
No, you say you're not that strong
And you don't need another broken heart
You don't need another broken heart
No, you don't need another broken heart

Broken heart
Broken heart
Another broken heart
Another broken heart
Broken heart
Broken, broken heart
