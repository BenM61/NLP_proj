Why should I wait, what is left there for me?
I come to claim, to win the game
Why should I plea for my fair and right move?
I come to play, I come to stay

I don't wanna bitch around no more
I don't wanna stand back anymore

It's my god-given right
To stand and fight
For what I like
It's my god-given brain
That cried in pain
Would I resign
There's nothing to gain
If I would restrain
There's nothing to find
If I stay behind
It's my right
My god-given right

Why should I lose if I am meant to win?
I know I can, I've got a plan
All that they told me is right and so wrong
I went through schools, found my own rules

I don't wanna bitch around no more
I don't wanna stand back anymore

It's my god-given right
To stand and fight
For what I like
It's my god-given brain
That cried in pain
Would I resign
There's nothing to gain
If I would restrain
There's nothing to find
If I stay behind
It's my right

My god-given right
It's my god-given right
My god-given right
It's my god-given right

It's my god-given right
To stand and fight
For what I like
It's my god-given brain
That cried in pain
Would I resign
There's nothing to gain
If I would restrain
There's nothing to find
If I stay behind
It's my right (It's my right)
My god-given right
