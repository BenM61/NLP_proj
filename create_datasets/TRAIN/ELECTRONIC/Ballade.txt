Open eyes 
Seeing through
The hidden tracks 
Posing to

Stop the flight 
Keeping you
From the things 
You want to do

All your life 
Comes to this
All your life 
Comes to this

Redefine 
Who you are
Given time 
To heal the scars

It's enough 
To wash away
All the things 
That didn't stay

All your life 
Comes to this
All your life 
Comes to this

All your life 
Comes to this
All your life 
Comes to this, comes to this
