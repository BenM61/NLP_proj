Break down
I feel all broken down
Break down
I feel like I've broken down

These broken bones
They hold me up
I put one foot in front of the other
But it takes everything I've got
Even though
I don't wanna feel the pain anymore
Now I know
I am not who I was before
So while it comes and goes
There's always more in store
And there it is

My curse and cure
My curse and cure
My curse and cure

I'm ready
For the come and go
I'm ready
'Cause now I know
More each day
More each day
There's somethin' inside
Take my burdens away

Break down
My heart keeps breakin' down
Break down
My heart feels broken down
But there's still a heart
There's still the truth
Even in a million pieces
It gets me through
Even though
I don't wanna feel the pain anymore
Now I know
I am not who I was before
So while it comes and goes
There's always more in store
And there it is

My curse and cure
My curse and cure
My curse and cure

I'm ready
For the come and go
I'm ready
'Cause now I know
More each day
More each day
There's somethin' inside
Take my burdens away

I'm ready
For the come and go
I'm ready
'Cause now I know

More each day
More each day
There's somethin' inside
Take my burdens away

This broken spirit
It's in your hands
This broken spirit
It's in your hands
In your hands

It's in your hands
It's in your hands
