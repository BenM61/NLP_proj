Lean into my side
Never felt alive
Call the chants inside
(We will wait for this, we will wait for this)

Lean into my side
Never felt alive
Call the chants inside
(We will wait for this, we will wait for this)

Lean into my side
Never felt alive
Call the chants inside

We will wait for this
We will wait for this
We will wait for this
We will

Lean into my side
Never felt alive
Call the chants inside
(We will wait for this, we will wait for this)

Lean into my side
Never felt alive

We will wait for this
We will wait for this
We will wait for this
We will wait for this

Lean into my side
Never felt alive
Call the chants inside

Lean into my side
Never felt alive
Call the chants inside
You see right through me
