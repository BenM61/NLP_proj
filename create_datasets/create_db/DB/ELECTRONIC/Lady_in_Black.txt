Deserted place and so far from home
I was alone
I was all on my own.
The moon was shining
I saw her face

A magic woman all dressed in a lace.
She gave me a sign and I followed her
House of light somewhere in the night.

Behind the window the symbols of red
Painting the face of the lady in black.
Behind the window I'll never forget
The magic lady
The lady in black.
She'll never come back
Come back.

The lady's beauty was so divine
She took my heart with her heavenly smile.
When I reached out just to kiss her hand
I suddenly tumbled down in the sand.
There was broken lace lying on the ground

And the house of light was fading in the night.
Behind the window the symbols of red
Painting the face of the lady in black.
Behind the window I'll never forget
The magic lady
The lady in black.
She'll never come back
Come back.
