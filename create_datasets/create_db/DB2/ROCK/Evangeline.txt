She's on another planet
She's in my dream
She's some kind of angel
If you know what I mean
Try her on
She fits like a glove
Too bad she only thinks about
The lord above

Evangeline Evangeline
I think I love you
But Evangeline Evangeline
I want you

Now if I called you up
Do you think you 
Could deliver my soul?
Won't you take a drink
Little darlin'
The cup is full

And every night I bow to pray
But I'll feel a whole lot better
Once you're coming my way

Evangeline Evangeline
I think I love you
But Evangeline Evangeline
I want you

So come on down

So tell me how you want it
Come on, tell me how you want it
Just tell me how you want it

Just tell me how you want it
We won't be seen
You can tell your father
It was all a dream
(try her on she fits like a glove)
Too bad the only man you trust
Is god above

Evangeline Evangeline
I think I love you
But Evangeline Evangeline
I want you

Now Evangeline Evangeline
I think I love you
But Evangeline Evangeline
I want you

She's some kind of angel
If you know what I mean
Evangeline
