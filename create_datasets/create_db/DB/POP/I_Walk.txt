Like anybody else
Just trying to make sense
When all others seem to know
What to do and where to go

They've taken the book
Without a second look
And that's alright with me
I'm all I wanna be

I walk
I walk
I walk the way I talk
I am walking
I am walking
I walk the way I talk

Is there a deeper sense
To our Existence
Now there's a philosophy
That don't do it for me

I walk
I walk
I walk the way I talk
I am walking
I am walking
I walk the way I talk

Everything that's gone before
Leads the way to something more
Carrying within all I need
Take the pictures from the wall
You could try to get a clue
Make a step in these shoes
You could find a fool and see
Could be right it could feel free

I walk
I walk
I walk the way I talk
I am walking
I am walking
I walk the way I talk

And it's here in my heart
And it's deep in my soles
And a strong feel for life
Is where I find home
There's no answers to seek
No torches to hold
No past and no grief
I just follow the call

I walk
I walk
I walk the way I talk
I am walking
I am walking
I walk the way I talk
