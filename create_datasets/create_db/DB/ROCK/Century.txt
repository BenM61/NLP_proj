Catch me when I'm falling [Repeat: x3]
Century [Repeat: x4]

[Chorus: x2]
Everything I touch
Everything I touch
Everything I touch
Lightening tries to kill my love

One's future must take change
Nostalgic knocked down
Traffic stops abandoned
Out of sync out of fashion

Empty streets collide
Underground doesn't concern you
Architecturally sheik
Soon as we can meet you

[Chorus: x2]

Shop blinds and cloths
A new world war
Untimeless beauty
All the rage
All the rage
Promises broken
Television erased
Nothing is sacred
Cant condense to the golden age

[Repeat: x3]
Black
White
Blocks
Borders
Space
Crowd

Century [Repeat: x7]
