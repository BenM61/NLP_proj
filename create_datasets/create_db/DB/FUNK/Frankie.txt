Hey Frankie?

I was walking down the street one day
When I looked up I saw a friend

Hey Frankie, do you remember me?

He looked at me and then I blushed
'Cause I remembered I loved you so much
Way back then we were friends
Going together but then you left me

Frankie, do you remember me?
Frankie, do you remember?

You were fifteen, I was twelve
It was summer, we were so in love.
I never loved anyone this much
Look at me, I'm thrilled to your touch.

Hey Frankie, do you remember me?
Frankie, do you remember?

Oh how you brought me down (down, down)
All I did was run around (around)
You'll never know how much I loved you

Frankie, do you remember?
Do you remember me?
Frankie

You walked me to the Deli then
We sat in the booth where it all began
I looked into your big eyes and
Said to myself we coulda had twins

Hey Frankie, do you remember?

Oh how you brought me down (down, down)
All I did was run around (around)
You'll never know how much I loved you

He looked at me
And then I blushed
'Cause I remembered when I loved you so much
Way back when we were friends
Going together but then you left me

Frankie, do you remember me?
Frankie, do you remember me?

Frankie, do you remember me?
Do you remember me? Me, Frankie

Oh Frankie, oh Frankie my baby
Do you remember me?

Frankie, do you remember me?
Frankie, do you remember me?

Do you remember me? Me, Frankie
My Frankie, my baby Frankie, do you remember me?
Frankie, do you remember me?
Frankie
