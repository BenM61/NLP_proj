I love a girl in a whole another language
People look at us strange
Don't understand us.
They try to change it
I try to tell her don't change

We talk love and they say it sounds crazy
But love is more wild when you're angry
Don't understand why you wanna change it
Girl listen to me!

You're just running from the truth
That I'm scared of losing you.
You are worth too much to lose
Baby if you're still confused

Girl I'm just in love with you
Girl I'm just in love with you
No other words to use
I'm just in love with you
I'm just in love with you

When I tell you "I would never leave you"
Do you hear what I say?
I don't understand you
You say you need time
But you've been calling all day.

We talk love and they say it sounds crazy
Love's even more wild when you're angry
Don't understand why we wanna change it
Girl listen to me!

You're just running from the truth
That I'm scared of losing you.
You are worth too much to lose
Baby if you're still confused

Girl I'm just in love with you
(Do you hear what I say?)
That I'm just in love with you
(Can't nobody change it)
No other words to use
(I love you baby)
I'm just in love with you
(I'm just in love with you)
I'm just in love with you
(I'm just in love with you)
I'm just in love with you

Never knew what we have
They don't understand
We're just a waste of time
We know this is real.
I know how you feel
When you put your hand in mine.

Girl I'm just in love with you
Girl I'm just in love with you
No other words to use
I'm just in love with you
(Let me say it again, let me say it again)
I'm just in love with you
(Just in love, just in love)
I'm just in love with you.
