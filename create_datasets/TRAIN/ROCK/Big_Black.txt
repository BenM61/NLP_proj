Bypassing history, travelling time
Omnipotent presence, the power sublime
True path of wisdom, stoner doom grows
Where Big Black came from, the Lightbringer knows

Traversing the cosmos with stars as its eyes
Crushing the galaxy, nebulas die
A nova erupts its soul into space
The Big Black's the soul of the old stoner race

The end of all things is approaching us soon
Destruction brought on by the legions of doom
Damnation eternal for men of poor thought
The Big Black's the force that the wizards once sought
