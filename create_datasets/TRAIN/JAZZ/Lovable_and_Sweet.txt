Dumb dumb be dumb
Dumb dumb be dumb
I'm not lonely
Dumb dumb be dumb
I got a real man
What an ideal man, now!
Dumb dumb be dumb
Dumb dumb be dumb
He's my only dumb dumb be dumb!
Person I love
Has all of my love
And how!
Talk about your classic lover
And you couldn't help discover
That he's that way lovable and sweet
He's candy!
No one else can hold a candle
What a precious thing to handle!
And he's that way lovable and sweet!
Oh gee!
Oh gosh!
Whenever we're all alone
Oh gosh and oh gee!
What happens, it simply wouldn't be known!
Bubblin' over with affection
Satisfyin' to perfection
Is he that way lovable and sweet!
Talk about your nifty dresser!
What a lover, some caresser!
Is he that way lovable and sweet!
Do I know just what I'm gettin'
When it comes to real love pettin'!
Is he that way lovable and sweet!
That guy, oh my
Has made me lose all control!
His kiss!
What bliss!
It weakens the heart, but it turns into soul!
And although he's such a night-man
Could he even be the right man?
Yes, he's that way lovable and sweet!
