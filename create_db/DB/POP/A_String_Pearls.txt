Ba, by, here's a five-and-dime
Ba, by, now's about the time

For a string of pearls à la Woolworth
Every pearl's a star above
Wrapped in dreams, and filled with love
That old string of pearls à la Woolworth

Till that happy day in Spring
When you buy the wedding ring
Please, a string of pearls à la Woolworth
Ba, by you made quite a start

Found the way right to my heart
With a string of pearls à la Woolworth
Wait till the stars peek-a-boo
I've got something just for you

It's a string of pearls à la Woolworth
I found a love so sublime
Right in that old five and dime
With a string of pearls à la Woolworth
