The missing link of the evolution
Is something we can never find
There's nothing left here but confusion
So i'm leaving it behind

It's been a thorn in my side, all of my life

I've seen it once, i've seen it a thousand times
Read between the lines
The more i seek, the more i find disguise
The hope is gone and everything we stood for
Is slipping through our hands
Like a castle in the sand
This is the broken promised land.

I can see through their illusions
All for one and none for all
The strongest whisper; revolution
Their religion is a loaded gun

For generations to come it's all said and done

I've seen it once, i've seen it a thousand times
Read between the lines
The more i seek, the more i find disguise
The hope is gone and everything we stood for
Is slipping through our hands
Like a castle in the sand
This is the broken promised land

When there's a will there's a weapon, dear friend...

I've seen it once, i've seen it a thousand times
Read between the lines
The more i seek, the more i find disguise
The hope is gone and everything we stood for
Is slipping through our hands
Like a castle in the sand
In the broken promised land

I've seen it once, i've seen it a thousand times
Across the borderlines
The more i seek, the more i find disguise
The hope is gone and everything we stood for
Is slipping through our hands
Like a castle in the sand
This is the broken promised land
The broken promised land
