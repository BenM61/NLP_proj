Far away (Yeah!)
Yeah
Bone Thugs-n-Harmony
Far away (with Stephen Marley!)
Yeah!

Soon I'll be coming home
Been around the world like a rolling stone
Seen the whole world wide through my own eyes
Been a long time coming
A million miles and still running
Tryna find my way back
To my roots where the true thugs lay at
And I say that, "I'm tryna go home
Take me somewhere that
My mind mode is on free
And my time zone is on freeze"
Everything stop!
I'm a need a little bit of time to get myself together
In the mean time I turn best to better
And in between time trying to be blessed forever
I hear home calling back for me

I think it's time I take a flight
To elevate my mind and make it my life
Been tryna get right
The big lights blinding me, they bright
I've been in darkness most my life
So I fight with all of my might
To make it back one day
Nigga someday it'll all work out someway

Sun up to sundown we going
Let's catch a flight in the 'morn
Promise I'll make it back home
I'll be back with you just one day, one day
Just give me one day, one day

Sun up to sundown we going
Let's catch a flight in the 'morn
Promise I'll make it back home
I'll be back with you just one day, one day
Just give me one day, one day
Just give me one day

From the first of the month till the ruggish bone
Every week that crossroads stayed on the billboard
Baby said Wayne made up the word bling
Man I should've patented my whole damn flow
Sleep on a train tracks man it ain't so
Kray and I never had a place we could go
Walking around wondering were we ever 'gon blow
With a gun and our heart let all the wolves know

Buck buck tell my nigga stuck like chuck
100 to 5 I bet he never missed a lunch
Rainy day, hey nigga what about us?
Couldn't gone home, it was too fucked up
And my shoes fucked up but it's cool when it's rough
After that now we got more than enough
New black love two shooters and a glove
Easy upstairs to accompany me son

Tried to rob a little nigga but the talented one
Word to the widow and word to E' son
Still look young and these niggas ain't dumb
Cleveland is the city where the Bone Thugs come from
Come from, come from, never gonna run from
No, nuh, I need an a earthquake shown up
So all my niggas don't fall out

Sun up to sundown we going
Let's catch a flight in the 'morn
Promise I'll make it back home
I'll be back with you just one day, one day
Just give me one day, one day

Sun up to sundown we going
Let's catch a flight in the 'morn
Promise I'll make it back home
I'll be back with you just one day, one day
Just give me one day, one day

Maybe you should come back home?
Maybe I should come back home?
Maybe I should come back home?
Bone coming home, Bone coming home
