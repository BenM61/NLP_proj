Oh, tico tico, tick!
Oh, tico tico, tock!
This tico tico, he's the cuckoo in my clock.
And when he says "cuckoo,"
He means it's time to woo,
It's tico time for all the lovers on the block.

I've got a heavy date,
A tete a tete at eight,
So speak, oh, tico, tell me if it's getting late?
If I'm on time, cuckoo,
But, if I'm late, woo-woo!
The one my heart is gone to may not want to wait!

For just a birdie, and a birdie who goes nowhere,
He knows of every lover's lane and how to go there;
For in affairs of the heart
My tico's terribly smart,
He tells me: "gently, sentimentally at the start!"

Oh, oh, I hear my little tico tico calling
Because the time is right and shades of night are falling.
I love that not-so-cuckoo cuckoo in the clock,
Tico tico tico tico tico tock!
