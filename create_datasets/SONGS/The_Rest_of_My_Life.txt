I fell asleep last Saturday
Underneath polluted skies
I walked alone in those Jersey nights
And I
Saw the board walk start to fall
The empty ness starts to drown
The quiet corners of this town tonight

Late last night I made my plans
It was the only thing I felt I could do
Said goodbye to my best friend
Sometimes there's no one left to tell you the truth

It's gonna kill me the rest of my life
Let me apologize while I'm still alive
I know it's time to face
All of my past mistakes
It's gonna kill me for the rest of my life

This is my all time low
Somehow it feels so familiar
Somehow it seems so familiar
I fell like letting go
And every second that goes by
I'm screaming out for second tries

Said goodbye to my best friend
Sometimes there's no one left to tell you the truth

It's gonna kill me the rest of my life
Let me apologize while I'm still alive
I know it's time to face
All of my past mistakes
I've got to live with them the rest of my life

This is the mess I've made
These are the words I can't erase
This is my life support
Shutting down
For the final time
And it swings like a blade?
And kills me for the rest of my life

If you won't forgive me the rest of my life
Let me apologize while I'm still alive
I know it's time to face
All of my past mistakes
It's gonna kill me for the rest of my life

It's gonna kill me for the rest of my life
It's gonna kill me for the rest of my life
