I'm blessed with a heart that doesn't stop
My minds a weathervane it spins around just like a top
Knows what the winds of fortune bring
In the season of the witch
Home is a perjury, a parlor trick, an urban myth

Oh how the circumstances change
This world of smoke and steel
Of compromise and meter-maids
I'm going to leave here before too long
Zigzagging toward the light
I'm off to sing my bounder's song

True love it hides like city stars
Nothing to gaze upon or contemplate
How near or far
If it comes, it comes quite unannounced
A momentary glance
Lit up by sun or moon
Or bonfire or ambulance

How the circumstances change
Feels unmistakable with no idea from where it came
But you will know it when it's gone
Zigzagging through the night
Half-dead you sing your bounder's song
Half-dead you sing, half-dead you sing

Sing for the bounder whose word is never kept
A bindle of flowers to state his mind
And bloom when he forgets

It's true that shadows tell the time
On sunny afternoons, on crowded sidewalks, passersby
I'm in a queue that stretches out
Far as the eye can see
It forms a figure eight and goes on for eternity

Oh how the circumstances change
I fly by interstate across a purple mountain range
I find a place to come undone
Zigzagging toward you now
I sing out loud my bounder's song
