High heeled and overzealous come
To beat my puppy love with all your sins
I'll come again
Bound to me suck my sickness like your lover
Sucks my weakness down like rain
We'll come again 

Hurray for you boy
Just enough to make me easier
I was the one to never change
And I come and I come like rain 

Pumped thumping ripped it open
My disease is buried deep in all sweet things
We'll never change
Spoiled rotten by your secret still
I like to hold your creature close to me
It drove insane 

So here's to you girl
Opened up to make me easier
I was the one to never change
And I come and we come like rain
Lovely here and again like rain 

Don't be unsightly washed so cleanly
Never invited might not mean a thing
Don't be invited I'm so manly
Don't be dirty washed so cleanly
Always perverted might not mean a thing
Never unsightly not so manly 

And I come and I come like rain
Lovely here but again like rain
