Who is the hippie that's happenin' all over our town?
A tearin' up the chicks with the message that he's laying down
Tell me who is the coolest cat, that is what I am?
Fast talkin', slow walkin', good lookin' Mohair Sam

Chicks are makin' reservations for his lovin' so fine, so fine
Screamin' and a bakin', he's got 'em all waitin' in line
Who is the coolest guy that is what I am?
Fast talkin', slow walkin', good lookin' Mohair Sam

Chicks are makin' reservations for his lovin' so fine
You know, they screamin' and they faintin'
And they got 'em all waitin' in line
Who is the coolest guy that is what I am?
Fast talkin', slow walkin', good lookin' Mohair Sam
Fast talkin', slow walkin', good lookin' Mohair Sam
