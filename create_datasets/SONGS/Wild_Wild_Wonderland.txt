This world turning into my stage
Don't wanna be caged
If I feel demons getting me down
I'll cast 'em all out
'Cause I know that

It's not always fun and games
Take the heights with the pain
Turn it into burning flames
'Cause I will never be tamed
Yeah, I've gotta learn to say
Scream my lungs out and be brave
No more hiding in the shame

It's my wild wild wonderland, -land
I'll take it if you want to
It's your time, embrace the chance, dance
Now do what makes you feel good

Wild wild wonderland
Wild wild wonderland
Wild wild wonderland

What you see is what you will get
Now, what you expect?
Around three?, shouting "life is my (?)"
So I lead with my heart
Don't you know that

It's not always fun and games
Take the heights with the pain
Turn it into burning flames
'Cause you will never be tamed
Yeah, you've gotta learn to say
Scream your lungs out and be brave
No more hiding in the shame

It's my wild wild wonderland, -land
I'll take it if you want to
It's your time, embrace the chance, dance
Now do what makes you feel good

Wild wild wonderland
Wild wild wonderland
Wild wild wonderland

It's not always fun and games
Take the heights with the pain
Turn it into burning flames
'Cause you will never be tamed
Yeah, you've gotta learn to say
Scream your lungs out and be brave
No more hiding in the shame

It's my wild wild wonderland, -land
I'll take it if you want to
It's your time, embrace the chance, dance
Now do what makes you feel good

Wild wild wonderland
Wild wild wonderland
Wild wild wonderland
Do what makes you feel good

Wild wild wonderland
Wild wild wonderland
Wild wild wonderland
