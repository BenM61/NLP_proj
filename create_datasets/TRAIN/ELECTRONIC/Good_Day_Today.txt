So tired of fire, so tired of smoke 
So tired of fire, so tired of smoke 
Send me an angel, save me 
Send me an angel, save me 

I wanna have a good day today 
I wanna have a good day today 
I wanna have a good day today 
Good day today

Tired of ? goes so low 
Tired of ? goes so low 
Send me an angel, save me 
Send me an angel, save me 

So tired

Send me an angel, save me
Send me an angel, save me
Send me an angel, save me

I wanna have a good day today 
I wanna have a good day today 
I wanna have a good day today 
Good day today

So tired of fearing, so tired of dark
So tired of fearing, so tired of dark
Send me an angel, save me 
Send me an angel, save me 

I wanna have a good day today 
I wanna have a good day today 
I wanna have a good day today 
Good day today
