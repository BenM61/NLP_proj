Saturday night and the streets are filling up
Saturday night and my mates are calling up
Wondering where I've been, where I've been
If I'm ever coming out again, out again

Guess I don't see the harm in just a couple drinks
Guess I don't see the harm in having two or three
Probably do me good, do me good
'Cause I think of you more than I should, than I should

They think they're trying to help introducing me to someone else
I play along 'cause I haven't got the heart to tell 'em

That if I dance with somebody
I might want somebody else
And if I want somebody
I might fall in love and forget what it was to be
Wrapped in your arms so tightly
To be your man so tonight I'll be
Dancing alone 'cause I'm afraid if I forget then you'll just become an Ex

Ex, Ex
Just another Ex
Ex, Ex
Just become an Ex

Now I remember why this was a bad idea
Now I remember even less than when we got here
Memories, memories
I feel you slipping away from me, away from me

I almost wish they'd play the song we used to sing
I almost bought some other girl your favourite drink
Had to stop myself, stop myself
Had to drink the lemon drop myself, drop myself

They think they're trying to help introducing me to someone else
I play along 'cause I haven't got the heart to tell 'em

That if I dance with somebody
I might want somebody else
And if I want somebody
I might fall in love and forget what it was to be
Wrapped in your arms so tightly
To be your man so tonight I'll be
Dancing alone cause I'm afraid if I forget then you'll just become an Ex

Ex, Ex
Just another Ex
Ex, Ex
Just become an Ex
Ex, Ex
Just another Ex
Ex, Ex
Just become an Ex

If I dance with somebody
I might want somebody else
And if I want somebody
I might fall in love and forget what it was to be
Wrapped in your arms so tightly
To be your man so tonight I'll be
Dancing alone 'cause I'm afraid if I forget then you'll just become an Ex

Ex, Ex
Just another Ex
Ex, Ex
Just become an Ex
Ex, Ex
Just another Ex
Ex, Ex
Just become an Ex
