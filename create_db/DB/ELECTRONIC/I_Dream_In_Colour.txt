I look at the river
But I'm thinking of the sea
The past overwritten
By what I hope to be
I search for the essence
It's my command
That is the centre
It's what I demand
In my mind
I'm standing in a glasshouse
Looking below

Don't wanna look without seeing
Don't wanna touch without feeling

I dream in colour
Yes I dream in colour
When the world's in black and sepia tone
Or in sleepy monochrome
I dream in colour
Yes I dream in colour
I see much further than this
I see much further than this
Yes

In a room with no windows
And painted doors
What once was my ceiling
Now is the floor
My landscape is changing
From out of the dust
It's some kind of healing
Like the sun coming up
In my mind
I'm standing in a glasshouse
Looking below

Don't wanna hear without listening
Don't wanna talk without speaking

I dream in colour
Yes I dream in colour
When the world's in black and sepia tone
Or in sleepy monochrome
I dream in colour
Yes I dream in colour
I see much further than this
I see much further than this
I dream in colour
Yes I dream in colour
When the world's in black and sepia tone
Or in sleepy monochrome
I dream in colour
Yes I dream in colour
I see much further than this
Gotta to be more than this

I can see through the clouds of grey
Got a window on the world
I can sweep them all away 
Got a window on the world

Don't wanna look without seeing
Don't wanna touch without feeling

I dream in colour
Yes I dream in colour
When the world's in black and sepia tone
Or in sleepy monochrome
I dream in colour
Yes I dream in colour
I see much further than this
I see much further than this
I dream in colour
Yes I dream in colour
When the world's in black and sepia tone
Or in sleepy monochrome
I dream in colour
Yes I dream in colour
I see much further than this
I see much further than this
