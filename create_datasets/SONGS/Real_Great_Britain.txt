Union Jack and Union Jill
Back up and down the same old hill
Sell the flag to the youths
But who swallows the bill
Murdoch she wrote
Him have his hand in the till

Blairful of Thatcher
Stuck on the 45
The suits have changed
But the old ties survive
New britannia cool
Who are you trying to fool? 
Behind your fashion-tashion 
I see nothing at all

Care for the commodity
Cuts the nation into three
Rich pickings for the first
Bottom third you never see
While middle england keeps swinging it's
Loyalty
No concern for the future
Just with dead royalty

So will the real, the real Great Britan
Step forward
This is the national identity parade
Shoe gazer nation forever looking
Backwards
Time to reject the sixties charade

Not enough schools
Not enough homes
Just phony care in his millennium dome
More prime cuts than beef on the bone
And there's too many questions you're
Not answering tone

Union Jack and Union Jill
Back up and down the same old hill
Sell the flag to the youths
But who swallows the bill
Murdoch she wrote
Him have his hand in the till

So will the real, the real Great Britan
Step forward
This is the national identity parade
Shoe gazer nation forever looking
Backwards
Time to reject the sixties charade
