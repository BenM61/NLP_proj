In a coffee shop in a city 
Which is every coffee shop in every city 
On a day which is every day 
I picked up a magazine 
Which is every magazine 

Read a story, and then forgot it right away 
They say goldfish have no memory 
I guess their lives are much like mine 
And the little plastic castle 
Is a surprise every time 
And it's hard to say if they're happy 
But they don't seem much to mind 

From the shape of your shaved head 
I recognized your silhouette 
As you walked out of the sun and sat down 
And the sight of your sleepy smile 
Eclipsed all the other people 
As they paused to sneer at the two girls 

From out of town 
I said, look at you this morning 
You are, by far, the cutest 
But be careful getting coffee 
I think these people wanna shoot us 
Or maybe there's some kinda local competition here 
To see who can be the rudest 

People talk 
About my image 
Like I come in two dimensions 
Like lipstick is a sign of my declining mind 
Like what I happen to be wearing 
The day that someone takes a picture 
Is my new statement for all of womankind 
I wish they could see us now 

In leather bras and rubber shorts 
Like some ridiculous new team uniform 
For some ridiculous new sport 
Quick, someone call the girl police 
And file a report 

In a coffee shop in a city 
Which is every coffee shop in every city 
On a day which is every day
