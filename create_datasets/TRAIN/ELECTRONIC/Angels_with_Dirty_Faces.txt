I'm confused, I don't know 
Which way do I really go
This guy is fly
But another one pass me by
Stuck in the middle of this spot 
That is to damn hot 
Shall I choose the one
With the heavy car or not
'coz nothing ain't serious 
See I'm only seventeen 
And I want to be mysterious 
Naughty, sexy on the cheep 
Never sleep
Won't reveal the sneaky side of me

All day and night I creep out
I think about who I'm gonna go and link up 
Don't think that I'm innocent, baby
'coz this is driving me crazy
Tell me what do you see
I'm not such an innocent girl

You don't know where we go 
You don't know 
That we'er angels with dirty faces in the morning
You don't know we've been on the town low
You don't know that we're missing to the morning

I'd say I'm the kinda girl 
You'd say is shy
But I don't think that's the answer 
You'd hear if you asked my guy 
I'm just a girl who likes to let it go
Party with my ladies 'till dawn
Still don't just let go

Move your heads to the beat
And shake it down like you never did before
Move a little closer come with me
I'll show you the place to be
That's what he said to me

Chours x2

We're the type of girls don't think 
Just say everything we want
We know we'll get our own way
Sexy,classy
Don't think you'll put it past me 
Angels in the day 
But at night could be nasty
Keisha: want to have the fellas locked on ice
Mutya: want to play around with them like dice
Heidi: he did'nt know this girl was a freak until he met me after dark 
He thought this girl was chic

Chours x2

You don't know where I go
