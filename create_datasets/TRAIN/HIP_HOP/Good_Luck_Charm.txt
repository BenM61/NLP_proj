And she's my light
My shining star
She's so dear to me yes she is, she is
My rabbit's foot, my lucky charm
Yes she is, yes she is
Whoa whoa whoa oh

Every time that something good happens in my life
You're always there for me, looking good by my side
Picture you down, pullin' up your panty hose
And you always got that sexy underwear on
So much good has come my way
Since she came in my life
I'll never push you away or brush you off to the side
See girl I
See my luck has changed for the better

See I got so much love for you in these arms
Don't you know that you're my good luck charm
Where you are forever girl ain't no harm
Ain't nobody else can borrow it, I won't allow it

See I got so much love for you in these arms
Don't you know that you're my good luck charm
Lovin' you forever girl and never do I
Wanna go without, my good luck charm

Like a rabbits foot on keys, or some lucky dice
All I want or need, I ain't gotta ask twice
Where would I be? what would I do
Without you looking out for me?
Probably be, probably be in these streets

Without you in my life,
My future ain't the same, no
And I'm not wanting the blame
Baby I, know I been around, I'm
Tired of messing around, I
Got so much love

See I got so much love for you in these arms
Don't you know that you're my good luck charm
Where you are forever girl ain't no harm
Ain't nobody else can borrow it, I won't allow it

See I got so much love for you in these arms
Don't you know that you're my good luck charm
Lovin' you forever girl and never do I
Wanna go without, my good luck charm

And I'd throw away this ice, and
Give up my J.E. pieces,
Just to get a piece of your love forever
And I knew you were a keeper
So baby girl I'm keepin' you.
Can't think about letting you go no no
It seems like every situation I been facing,
You know what to do to save me
So I know you bring me love,
So I'm standing strong like a soldier,
I know how to hold you,
I'm saying this to let you know
I got so oh

See I got so much love for you in these arms
Don't you know that you're my good luck charm
Where you are forever girl ain't no harm
Ain't nobody else can borrow it, I won't allow it

See I got so much love for you in these arms
Don't you know that you're my good luck charm
Lovin' you forever girl and never do I
Wanna go without, my good luck charm
