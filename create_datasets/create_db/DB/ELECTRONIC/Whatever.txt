You pulled some tricks out your sleeve last night
Everything I fantasize about
You had me climbing up a wall
How many ways was God called

You represented in the fashion of the truly gifted
You put it down last night
Knocked me out then had me dreaming 'bout waking up, alright
Do you want some money baby

How about some chicken wings
Do you want some fish and grits
I'll hurry and go get it
Whatever

We made a groove last night
A poignant rocking forth and back alright
Anything I can do for you
Just ask sometimes you won't have to

I'll be happy just to make you happy
And that's true
Oh
We made powerful

Love last night
Never knew passion could taste so sweet alright
I made a vow to you
Everything I do for you is a joy and a gift
You got my whole life lifted
