I need something I can dance to,
On and on, spin my world, like a record now
On and on, give me something I can dance to
Something I can count on, on and on,
Spin my world, like a record now,
On and on, I need something I can dance to

And every night I'd pray, it let me,
Can you hear me now D-J, you're gone tomorrow but
Just let the music play, just let me
Just let the music play, let the music play

I could be dancing,
I could be dancing all night,
If you'd play,
I would be dancing,
I would be doing alright,
If you'd play

I need something I can turn to,
Now and then, take me out, out now,
On and on, I need something I can turn to,
Something I can count in,
Day and night, on and on, like a record now,
Out now, I need something I can dance to

And every night I'd pray, it let me,
Can you hear me now D-J, you're gone tomorrow but
Just let the music play, just let me
Just let the music play, let the music play

I could be dancing,
I could be dancing all night,
If you'd play,
I would be dancing,
I would be doing alright,
If you'd play

If you'd play,
If you'd play

I could be dancing,
I could be dancing all night,
If you'd play,
I would be dancing,
I would be doing alright (alright),
If you'd, you'd, you'd, you'd play

If you'd play (if you'd play)

I would be dancing,
I would be doing alright (alright),
If you'd play (D-J),

Just let the music play, let the music play,
Just let the music play, all night, alright,
Just let the music play, let the music play,
All night, let the music play,
All night, just let the music play,
Let the music play, alright,
Just let the music play (D-J)
