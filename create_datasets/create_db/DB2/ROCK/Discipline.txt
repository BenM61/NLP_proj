Forget tomorrow
You're loyal tonight
You're hung up on the touch of another
Lover
You may be human
Body and mind
Who's in control of your brain
When your heart's gone blind?

It feels so real
You can't help yourself (you can't help yourself!)
If your not made of steel
You've gotta sit yourself down
And tell yourself

It takes discipline
When you find someone
When you're deep inside
Not to come undone
When temptation tastes
Too dangerous
It takes discipline
When you make love

Born out of passion
It's hard to hold on
It's easier to drown in an ocean
Of emotion
So wind you up and
Get down to your soul
When every night a stranger comes knocking
But you're sleeping alone

You don't want to bleed
'Cause you've been hurt before (You've been hurt before! )
Surrender to your needs
But, Love, protect yourself
'Cause love is war

It takes discipline
When you find someone
When you're deep inside
Not to come undone
When temptation tastes
Too dangerous
It takes discipline
When you make love
It takes discipline
When you make love

And it feels so real
You can't help yourself (you can't help yourself! )
And your not made of steel
You've gotta sit yourself down
And tell yourself
It might feel like heaven but it might be hell

It takes discipline
When you find someone
When you're deep inside
Not to come undone
When temptation tastes
Too dangerous
It takes discipline
When you make love

It takes discipline
When you find someone
That you want so bad
That it drives you mad
When a kiss just isn't
Hot enough
It takes discipline
When you make love
It takes discipline
When you make love
(It takes discipline
When you find someone
When you're deep inside
Not to come undone)

When you make love
(It takes discipline
When you find someone
When you're deep inside
Not to come undone)

It takes discipline
When you find someone
When you're deep inside
Not to come undone
It takes discipline
When you find someone
When you're deep inside
Not to come undone

Uh huh
