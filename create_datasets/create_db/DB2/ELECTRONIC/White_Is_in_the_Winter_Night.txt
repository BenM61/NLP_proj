Have you seen the mistletoe
It fills the night with kisses
Have you seen the bright blue star
It fills your heart with wishes
Have you seen the candlelight
It shines from every window
Have you seen the moon above
It lights the sky in silver

Green is in the mistletoe
And red is in the holly
Silver in the stars above
That shine on everybody
Gold is in the candlelight
And crimson in the embers
White is in the winter night
That everyone remembers

Have you heard the boys outside
When all the girls are skating
Have you heard their sweet hearts cry
For all this time they're waiting

Green is in the mistletoe
And red is in the holly
Silver in the stars above
That shine on everybody
Gold is in the candlelight
And crimson in the embers
White is in the winter night
That everyone remembers

Have you seen the children playing
Tiny hands are frozen
Have you seen them hurry home
When suddenly its snowing

Green is in the mistletoe
And red is in the holly
Silver in the stars above
That shine on everybody
Gold is in the candlelight
And crimson in the embers
White is in the winter night
That everyone remembers

Have you heard that bells are ringing
Ringing out their story
Have you heard the choir singing
Glory, glory glory
