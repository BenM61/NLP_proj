Ahhhhhh     Bankroll

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Ahhhhhh     get money get money Bankroll
y'all don't really want it want it

(Boy Backs)
You don't really want to mess with the blue face
Big cars and a grand in a suitcase
Haters want to hate cause they two-faced
Bankroll get cake dog too late
Little mama want to shake like a earthquake
Drop them drawers
Lock them jaws
Flip on my ass like Dominique Doll
Show them that you represent the RAM Squad raw WHOO
You don't really want daddy-blue bucks
Spinnin in a blue truck
Linen with the blue Chucks
You don't really want big daddy
Creepin with the girl next store like Shaggy
You don't really want to mess with Backs
You don't really want to test the gat
Test the mack
Test the all-time rap villain in black
Where the hoes and the dough be at the (row??) be at

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
Ahhhhhh     get money get money Bankroll
y'all don't really want it want it

(Tommy Hil)
Yo y'all cats don't want it with the T Hill
Doin it big in New York like Sprewell
95 in the Jag goin south
With my bitch from the south with my dick her mouth UHH
I'm a playa for sho' (for sho')
Bankroll hit the club like gimme some mo' (gimme some mo')
Meet me at the back do' (back do')
So we can slide in
All my niggas ridin
y'all niggas want to ride with me
y'all niggas want to smoke and get high with me
Bitch trippin like I'm Jodeci
Tryin to kill cause she high off of ecstacy
In the club hoes next to me
Tryin to flex with me
Like recipe
Like shorty stand there hold this bottle of cristal
While I beat her with a pis-tal

Chorus (4X)

(Six Nine)
Yo yo y'all don't really want to mess with the niner
Backwoods in the hood big niner
Sellin dope in the hood big niner
You want trouble I'm givin out shiners
Wolverines got it locked don't panic
Tip and P come through with the jam hits
RAM Squad be the best god dammit
You could drive the truck but you can't Dodge Ram it

(Boy Backs)
y'all niggas want to ride with me
y'all niggas want to smoke get high with me
Most niggas out there can't ride with me
Females want to touch my privacy WHOA (2X)

Chorus to fade
