[Tricky]
Again, we go 'round and round
I'll get the drinks
I guess it's always my round

[Alex Mills]
Can you get me that drink

[Tricky]
Friends, girls, they come and go

[Alex Mills]
You think you're nice

[Tricky]
But trends remain in constant flow
See, she

[Alex Mills]
Got any cash

[Tricky]
She likes that money boy
 
And she, she's needs a puppy toy

[Chorus: Tricky and Alex Mills: x2]
You stare, you stare and look confused
Your fruit is slightly bruised
You wear but don't like men, no
Won't love, won't care again

[Tricky]
Girl, you got a vicious tongue

[Alex Mills]
You're talking to me

[Tricky]
Yeah, I wish
Wish you'd cough up a lung
Girl, you seem insecure

[Alex Mills]
Well you're an idiot

[Tricky]
Look at me
And think you're pure
Girl, get your head right

[Alex Mills]
There's nothing wrong with me innit?

Tricky]
You, yeah, you should get it right

[Chorus: x2]

[Tricky]
Again we go round and round
I'll get the drinks
It's always my round

[Chorus: Repeats]

[Alex Mills]
Ah piss off
