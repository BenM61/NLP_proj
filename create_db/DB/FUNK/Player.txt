I'm a player, girl, I thought you knew
When you started messin? around with me
Knew I wouldn't commit to you
?Cause I'm a player and I know you can't see it in my eyes

Everyone says that I'm innocent
And it should come as no surprise
That I'm a player and I really think you need to know
That I can't love you right now, baby
'Cause I need more time to grow

But when I do get ready to settle down
Baby, the first one I'm calling is you
Oh, when I do get ready to settle down
Baby, the first one I'm calling is you
But until then

I'm a player and I've traveled all around the world
I've broken many hearts and it really hurts to say this to you, girl
But I'm a player and it's kinda sad that it has to be this way
But I don't wanna lock you down until I'm ready
So right now, I'm gonna play

But when I do get ready to settle down
Baby, the first one I'm calling is you
Oh, when I do get ready to settle down
Baby, the first one I'm calling is you
But until then

But when I do get ready to settle down
Baby, the first one I'm calling is you
Oh, when I do get ready to settle down
Baby, the first one I'm calling is you
But until then
