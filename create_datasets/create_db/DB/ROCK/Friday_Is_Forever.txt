I knew a girl in shades of blue,
Who broke my heart and said "We're through"
Waiting for a girl like you
To change me like the weather
Since she left me high and dry
Split me like a Gemini
All those days are passing by
Like flowers in December

Friday is forever, we belong together
So come on, come on,
And don't you say never
If you go then I know, there is no tomorrow
So come on, come on,
You should know better
It's right, it's time for you and I
Friday is forever, we should be together tonight

No more living in her head,
No more crashing in my bed,
I'd rather go with you instead
Don't care where we end up
Hold your body close to mine
Blame it on the blood red wine
It takes a week to finally find if Friday is forever

Friday is forever, we belong together
So come on, come on,
And don't you say never
If you go then I know, there is no tomorrow
So come on, come on,
You should know better
It's right, it's time for you and I
Friday is forever, we should be together tonight

Don't be afraid, we will stay this way
Don't ever change, I'm in love with you
Whoa

Friday is forever, we belong together
So come on, come on,
And don't you say never
If you go then I know, there is no tomorrow
So come on, come on,
You should know better
It's right, it's time for you and I
Friday is forever, we should be together tonight
Friday is forever, we belong together
Friday is forever, we should be together tonight
We should be together tonight
