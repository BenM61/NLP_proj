You walk into the room with a smile
Only heaven knows what you do to me
And there's no tellin why you've come at all
Cause I can't be seen or heard as the seconds fly...minutes go
Something crazy's comin' over me
It's you I'm missin, and I thought it'd be easier
Like sunshine chasin clouds away

She walks in the room with a smile
Only heaven knows what she's bringing me
And there's no tellin why she comes at all
Cause I can't be seen or heard as the days fly, and the years go
Somethin crazy still comin over me
She's one hit, one smile, after all I'm to blame
But I want more than I thought I would
But then I guess, she came straight into my heart

Now she floats just like the angel from up above
One angel, watching over me
She's my fallin angel and we're in love
One angel, what you do to me

One more, been chasin her day long
And now here I go out again
Said I'd be there, cause I got nowhere to go
I want to be there, cause I got no one

Now she floats just like the angels from up above
One angel, watching over me
She's my fallin angel and we're in love
One angel, what you do to me
One angel, she's my one angel
She's my one angel
