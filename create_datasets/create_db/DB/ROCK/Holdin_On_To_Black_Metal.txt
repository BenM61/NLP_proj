It's a darkness you can't deny
But it don't belong in a grown up mind
Distortion finds place in a youngster's eyes
Comin' into life, you needn't cry

But at a certain point you gotta let it go
Or it will cost a permanent threshold
You know you'll find it out in something else good
Oh, black metal, you're so misunderstood

Holdin' on to black metal, black metal
Holdin' on to black metal, black metal
Black metal, you've been holdin' on too long

Oh, black metal, so misunderstood
Deep black service under Lucifer's hood
Black metal steals souls young, enough is enough
32-ounce refill out of Lucifer's cup

Black metal need to be unlearned you teenage pup
Look at you, a star child, you're all grown up

Still holdin' on to black metal, black metal
Still holdin' on to black metal, black metal
Black metal, you've been holdin' on too long

Catchin' waves on Lucifer's beach
Takin' shade underneath Lucifer's trees
Gettin' sustenance from Lucifer's peach
Oh, black metal, it's affecting all your speech

Holdin' on to black metal, black metal
Holdin' on to black metal, black metal
Black metal, you've been holdin' on too long

Black metal, black metal
Oh, bring them to me
Black metal
Oh, makin' me think
Black metal
Oh, one, two, three, let's rock
