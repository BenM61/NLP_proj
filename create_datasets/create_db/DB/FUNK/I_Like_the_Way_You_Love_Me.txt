Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Don't know why
But I love, I do, yeah, yeah

'Cause I like the way you love me
Oh, girl, oh, oh
Every time you kiss me
Thrills me from my head to feet
And I tell myself that deep inside
There will be no one else for me

'Cause I like the way you love me
Love me, love me
Oh, girl, oh, oh

And I like the way you thrill me, oh, girl, mmm, hmm
Well, you thrill me to my soul
And I like, I like it all so
And I tell myself that deep inside
I could never let you go

'Cause I like the way you love me
Love me, thrill me, chill me, love me, oh, baby
Oh, girl, oh, oh

And I like the way you love me, oh, girl, oh, oh
I love, your my love
You are mine
