I like to welcome everybody to the LP
One Day It'll All Make Sense, by me
What I want to do to you nah, really it's for you
Is open my mental window, hoping that you would climb in
Or if not, at least look in
I want to take you to places that I have been and to 
The places that I want to go. I mean this music
It ain't all that I got, but it does mean a lot to me
I injected my whole being into it, and I've been doing it for a while
It's like my whole life has become a style
I want to get into it yeah
