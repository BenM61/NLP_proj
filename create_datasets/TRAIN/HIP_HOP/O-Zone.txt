How shall I begin?  I'll f*ck at the wind
Come out on top bruised but still and all I'm winnin' in the end
O period see period, you're fearin' it
Next to me and my mic, rappers are just inferior
My posterior pulls not my brain, but secondary
Mic to mouth, is how I drag down adversaries
Let me give you a brief bio, O's not ? style
Innovations are my thing so I can go the extra mile
I'll 'tack, attract maximum, rarely minimum actions
Soon to be a club favorite, 'cause I'm the comin' attraction
Ruler schooled an MC, with official competition
Parasol, acapella peep the weak, competition
They should listen, is it live or Memorex, with lies
Scared to use intelligence, your methods are irrelevant
Home writin' poems, the wrong niggaz touched
The micraphone blown up, I'm callin' your bluff
Step into the O-Zone

My trusty mic will never get rusty, write rhymes day and night
Moonshine'll put your lyrics in a bind
(like the) in out, but still play penetrate em
I weight em up and down, size made 'em, who's laid 'em, now
He bare gashes, wounds are exposed
To ones writin' music, now he's a deep composer
Foes are flammable in it's entirety
Step back a hundred feet or so 'cause what I let loose, is fiery
Fisticuffs, slips are blistered
Non dread rappers want to sell 'cause it's hot, so they calypsin'
Claims they rips it, "Yo man I can flow," so what?
Every one two one three bars all I hear is a cuss
You ain't impressin' me, manifestin' meaninglessness
This is the second verse, so I'ma seal it off, like this
Here's an invitation, to be facin' me, to seek salvation
The proper education, step into the O-Zone...

My, O.C. in the zone, arcadis cannabis my arsenal of stock
I leave your minds lost in the mists
I pick you off without a timeline for, rhyme for
Give me an encore, O.C. be like soar like a condor
Effortless, one of the best at this, man the money I'm worth
To most governments, would leave a big, deficit
Mangificent, on my own trip, natural
Saturated by the blend of beats Buckwild present
Control the soulless with mind power, hour after minute
Every second troubleshootin', never died 'cause I'm infinite
When it's all over, and my physical shell just rot
Rhymes'll be left behind, to cold, blow up the spot
My presentation, you're tastin', I'm bassin' in your face and
This is Camp Crystal Lake and I'm Jason
Step into the O-Zone
