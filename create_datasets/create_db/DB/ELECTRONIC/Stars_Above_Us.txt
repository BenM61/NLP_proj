Stars above us
Cars below us
Out on the rooftop baby
Stars above us
Cars below us
Nothing can touch us baby

Just had to get out of there
I'm tired of all of those faces
Up here is out of sight
Outside with the breeze on our faces

Let's go up the stairway
My band doing it their way
Our sound's ruling all the airwaves
Butterflies taking flight

Stars above us
Cars below us
Out on the rooftop baby
Stars above us
Cars below us
Nothing can touch us baby

(Sun sets) over the city
(Won't you) come and catch it with me?
(Follow me) right up the stairway
Let's have some fun tonight

Stars above us
Cars below us
Out on the rooftop baby
Stars above us
Cars below us
Nothing can touch us baby

(La la la rooftops)
(La la la rooftops)
Stars above us
(La la la rooftops)
(La la la rooftops)
(etc to fade)
