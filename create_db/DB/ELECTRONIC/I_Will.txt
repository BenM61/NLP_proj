I will
Lay me down
In a bunker
Underground

I won't let this happen
To my children
Meet the real-world coming
Out of your shell

With white elephants
Sitting ducks
I will
Rise up

Little baby's eyes
Eyes, eyes, eyes
Little baby's eyes
Eyes, eyes, eyes

Little baby's eyes
Eyes
Eyes
