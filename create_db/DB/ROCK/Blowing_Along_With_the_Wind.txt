The pressure these days isn't easy so they say,
If you're trying to get through this world.
And if you're gonna make it,
Then you've got to live in a hurry.
This world they say may just end any day,
And I know that it possibly could.
But I can't do nothing about it,
So why should I worry.

I grew my hair long and sang a protest song,
And offered myself to this world,
Doing my best in the
Search and the quest for the white dove.
But I always knew I was just passing through,
And the trip has been rocky and long.
And through all the changes,
There's one thing I sure can be proud of.

[Chorus]
I'm just blowing along with the wind,
Taking it all in stride,
Thankful for every minute God gives me,
Goin' along for the ride,
Holdin' my woman's hand,
Helpin' out when I can,
Living the one life I own,
One day at a time.

I have lived down in some jerkwater towns,
Where the sidewalks are rolled up by ten.
And I've been a swinger,
And drifted the heart of a big town.
I've had some low rides and walked on the wild side,
And it's all been good in its way.
I've had some high-ole times,
And yeah, I've had some letdowns.

[Chorus: x2]
