No, I won't lose hope, no I won't lose sight
But heaven is a place I just can't find
Run from the shadows and run to the light
Running from a past I left behind

Haunted by a memory 
That I just can't set free
Searching for the man that I used to be

I've made my sacrifice 
In the ashes I found life
But heaven is a place that I just can't find

And I can feel it in my bones
Every time I think of home
(You're not alone, you're not alone, you're not alone)
It still haunts me like a ghost
But I know we're not alone
(You're not alone, you're not alone, you're not alone)

No, I can't lose hope, no I won't lose sight
And I won't stop looking for heaven's light
I hear the angels singing when I close my eyes
And I can hear the bells ringing like a siren's cry

Now I'm standing at the gates
And I just can't escape
Heaven is a place that I can't find

And I can feel it in my bones
Every time I think of home
(You're not alone, you're not alone, you're not alone)
It still haunts me like a ghost
But I know we're not alone
(You're not alone, you're not alone, you're not alone)

(You're not alone, you're not alone, you're not alone)

And I can feel it in my bones
Every time I think of home
It still haunts me like a ghost
But I know we're not alone

You're not alone, you're not alone
You're not alone, you're not alone
You're not alone, you're not alone
You're not alone, you're not alone
