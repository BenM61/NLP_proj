I was walking down the high street
When I heard footsteps behind me
And there was a little old man (hello)
In scarlet and grey, shuffling away (laughter)
Well he trotted back to my house
And he sat beside the telly (oaah...)
With his tiny hands on his tummy
Chuckling away, laughing all day (laughter)

Oh, I ought to report you to the gnome office
(gnome office)
Yes
(hahahahaha)

Ha ha ha, hee hee hee
"I'm a laughing gnome and you don't catch me"
Ha ha ha, hee hee hee
"I'm a laughing gnome and you can't catch me"
Said the laughing gnome

Well I gave him roasted toadstools and a glass of dandelion wine (burp, pardon)
Then I put him on a train to eastbourne
Carried his bag and gave him a fag
(haven't you got a light boy? )
"here, where do you come from? "
(gnome-man's land, hahihihi)
"oh, really? "

In the morning when I woke up
He was sitting on the edge of my bed
With his brother whose name was fred
He'd bought him along to sing me a song

Right, let's hear it
Here, what's that clicking noise?
(that's fred, he's a "metrognome", haha)

Ha ha ha, hee hee hee
"I'm a laughing gnome and you don't catch me"
Ha ha ha, hee hee hee
"I'm a laughing gnome and you can't catch me"

(own up, I'm a gnome, ain't I right, haha)
"haven't you got an 'ome to go to? "
(no, we're gnomads)
"didn't they teach you to get your hair cut at school? you look like a rolling gnome."
(no, not at the london school of ecognomics)

Now they're staying up the chimney
And we're living on caviar and honey (hooray!)
Cause they're earning me lots of money
Writing comedy prose for radio shows
It's the-er (what? )
It's the gnome service of course

Ha ha ha, hee hee hee
"I'm a laughing gnome and you don't catch me"
Ha ha ha, oh, dear me

(ha ha ha, hee hee hee
"I'm a laughing gnome and you can't catch me"
Ha ha ha, hee hee hee
"I'm a laughing gnome and you can't catch me")

(one more time, yeah)
