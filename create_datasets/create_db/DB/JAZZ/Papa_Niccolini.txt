He can mend any tattered shoe, Papa Niccolini 
He's your friend anytime you're blue, Papa Niccolini 
People send all their troubles to Papa Niccolini 
'Cause he trades all their old dreams for new 

Children stop at his little shop looking for a penny 
Though he's poor still you may be sure he has given many 
And I'm told with his heart of gold Papa Niccolini 
Will make all of your daydreams come true

He's patting and mending old shoes 
From Monday right up till Sunday 
He'll mend all your heartaches and blues
