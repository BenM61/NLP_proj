Please read me the phone book
From Abraham to Zuckerman
All addresses and names
Both Christian and sur-

You've my full attention
Yes I am the lucky one
To carry each word
From the place it occurred

In my neighbor's garden
I'll steal all the flowers
In the town you were born
I will do a handstand

'Cause I'm here
I came down in the last shower
With all the subtleties
Of a marching band

Seated in a lounge waiting to depart
You'd say that we're off to a flying start

So let's capture a city bus
We'll jump from burning buildings
While a circle of firemen
Catch us in a net

We'll make paper aeroplanes
Of encyclopaedia
From abacus to zebra
The entire set

For those who have matchmaking down to an art
They'd say that we're off to a broken heart

But there's never an argument
I don't need an apology
It's all half a dozen eggplants
Or six aubergines
Just please sing me the entire
Beatles anthology
From 'All My Loving'
To 'Yellow Submarine'
From 'All My Loving'
To 'Yellow Submarine'
From 'All My Loving'
To a yellow submarine
