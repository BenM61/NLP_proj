As we proceed 
To give you what you need 
B.I.G.  mutha fucka's 
Lil' Cease  mutha fucka's 

(Bristal) 
Yo  handsome Hansun 
Got dough like the Hanson's 
Niggas come fast  went out like Helly Hanson 
Mr. Bristal  you will never catch me dancin' 
Often prancing  only in a mansion 
In the party  I'm high and drunk  I see you glancin' 
Never blow my cool, even if it's jammin' 
If shit hit the fan then I got the cannon 
Cock, lick-shots, leave 'em where they standin' 
You can call the cops, I never get ran in 
Call Blake C., ya'll get the understanding 
Who my man is, who the fam' is 
All that bullshit you talk? Can it, we own the planet 
It's a definite, niggas over money, reppin' it 
Armageddon it, destroy e'rything when we settin' it 
You delicate, far away in the country where you better get 
Assets in, nigga 
Ya'll need to get wit' some veterans 

1 - (Big Harve) 
You don't want to play around 
You don't want to play around 
You don't want to play around with me 
No more, I'll kill you 

You don't want to play around 
You don't want to play around 
You don't want to play around with me 
No more, I'll kill you 

(Lil' Cease) 
Yo, yo, yo 
Niggas want to start shit, push the button 
See the dough flip from the carpet 
Me and Bris' about to lock down the market 
Gats be sparkin', they lie too 
Got crips in blood, that part true 
be	-Roc I'mma die for you 
Till this day, I'mma ride for you 
And God forbid, gotta die too 
When you pull that gat, I'll be right beside you 
To guide you, on who to hit and not to 
If a nigga guilty, got to die too 
That's the real-la, you're talkin' to the roach killer 
For more scrilla 
About to upset New York like Reggie Miller 
Once they say you turn thug, you turn killer 
Man, it's hard to turn back when a nigga feel ya 
That's why they tell ya you're nobody 'til somebody kill ya 
That's why until ya play it back, don't get too familiar 
Cause if you get too close, my nigga's might fuckin' killa ya 
Nigga

(Lil' Kim) 
Another one 
The Queen Bee, extraordinaire 
Lil' Cease, commin' at'cha 
For the year 2000 and the new millennium, Uh 

F*ck all you hoes, I blows like suits 
Bitches don't shake my hand, they salute the lieutenant 
Rich men kiss the back of the hand of the royal highness 
Pocohontas, Mafia's behind us, ballin' like Utah 
Didn't think a ghetto bitch could come this far 
From pushin' Buicks to candy apple red Jaguars 
Bitch think I'm rich, I could rock a fool blue suit 
A furry Kangol with some cowboy boots 
And still be the shit of the night 
When I come through 
You be on the side holdin' ya cups like the bums do 
Waitin' for the Queen to put some change in it 
I pull out a 'G' and drop it with a hundred grand left in my pocket 
I promoted this shit, so I got's to make a profit 
And all the ends are sins to my men's, down his prophet 
Me and Lil' Cease, it's part two, me partners 
Layin' niggas down like carpenters 
So pardon us, like Nike's, we just do it 
We ain't amateurs to this shit, we used to it 
And all the bodies I killed, keep 'em on file 
So when they anniversaries come, we pop Cristall 
Ask Bristal, the Golden Child, ta-dow 
Take it how I gives it, you talk it, you live it 
And don't forget it, bitches 

(Puffy) 
Stop tryin' to sound like her too, bitches

(Lil' Kim) 
Ya'll muthafucka's do not want to play with us 
Ya'll don't want to play with us 
We will fuckin' kill you 

Set the fucka's right 
I'll fuckin' kill you 
I don't give a f*ck who it is 

You don't want to play around
