Can't give you a reason to take yourself
So seriously
But I'll give you a way to enjoy yourself
Come over here with me

You say you don't wanna leave your house
Feelin' sad and blue
Well here's a reason to change your mind

You're invited - dog party - come on in
Well I said you're invited - dog party
Bring a dog or your ugly girlfriend
You're invited - dog party - come on in
You're invited - dog party

We'll drop the meat you bring in the sand
And throw it on the grill
I'll bring my own that you won't have
But I think your sister will
Got a stud wants to meet your bitch
If nature has it's way
It don't mean we're related no, no, no
