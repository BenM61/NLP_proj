Circles, goin' round in circles
Circles, goin' round in circles

You're taking too much time
To make up your mind
Either you love me or you don't
And all the other girls
In your crazy mixed up world
You said you'd drop them
But you know you won't
Sometimes I think about forgetting you
But it's so, so hard to make that choice
'Cause boy with you
I go to to seventh heaven
Just by the sound of your voice

Circles, goin' round in circles
Circles, goin' round in circles

Outta my head
That's where I'm going
Tryin' so hard to deal with you
It's not so easy tryin' to bare these changes
That you're puttin' me through
In my head there's a ball of confusion
And I can't figure out just what to do
I guess my life will keep on going round and round
Until I get away from you
