Shrill screaming sirens are calling 
The branded victims to death 
A sacrifice to the gods of iron 
Everybody is joining the mass 
The blinded multitude is screaming 
The defenseless victim is killed 
Pools of blood are screaming 
The tribute to the gods is fulfilled 

Slavery to all are rebellious 
It's a venture if you resist 
HU, challenged rulers of the universe 
All under their merciless fist 
But fight them as long as you can 
Or they hunt you until you are dead 
But stand up and fight for freedom 
So free the slaves from all dread 

Detain and destroy the gods of iron 
Fight them before it's too late 
Guard yourself from their defying 
Stand up and don't hesitate
