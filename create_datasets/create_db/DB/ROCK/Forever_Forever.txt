Let me be the one you love forever
We could make it work out fine together
Say you love just only me
My heart is yours to keep
Let me hold you in my arms
Forever forever
I just had to let you know I love you
I could never place no one above you
You were meant for only me
My heart is yours to keep
You and me, me and you

Forever forever
Let me be the only one forever
My heart would sing if we could be together
You were meant for only me
My heart is yours to keep
Let me hold you in my arms
Forever forever

Say you love just only me
My heart is yours to keep
Let me hold you in my arms
Forever forever
Forever forever
