I want to see it I want to loose
I want to throw myself into whatever I choose
I want to hold it I want to feel
I want to know that this is really biting at my heel
I know it's hard for you
I'll save the only truth
You don't have to lock the door
I don't live there anymore.

I know now that I want to keep it
Oh my god do I want love
I know now that I want to keep it
Oh my god do I want love.

I want to dream it and it to be true
I want to be the one they say "hey he's coming through"
They'll open up the door
We'll live here I promise you won't want anymore

I know now that I want to keep it
Oh my god do I want love
I know now that I want to keep it
Oh my god do I want love.
