Like a candle with a flame
That never dies
Through the good and bad
You've been by my side
And when the world outside
Is feeling so unkind
You were there to pick me up
Oh, I need your smile

Whenever I fall
There you are
I know that
My pain you feel in my heart
And when the life that I live
Seems so hard
There you are

Even though you're far away
I can still see you
Sometimes I swear you're still
Inside my mind
Tell me you are my shadow
That always follows me
You always seem to be right there
You're like an angel by my side

Whenever I fall
There you are
I know that
My pain you feel in my heart
And when the life that I live
Seems so hard
There you are

Unconditional loving
Is what you give me
Your heart is all that I want to know
Forever in you I have a home
I'll stay by your side
'Cause you are my light
In my heart
And in my life
Oh whenever I look
There you are
