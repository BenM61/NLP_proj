Strong enough for you... 
I believe in all that love can bring 
I can see it's mean to be 
And we'll be 

(Together) 
You'll see the best in me 
(Forever) 
We were mean to be 
'Cause I know it 
Yes I know there's always 
You to come home to 

Love see us through 
Because of you Love see us through 
Through and through 
This love is strong enough for two 
Like a child I want this love to grow 
In my smile, I tell it all 
So we'll be 

(Together) 
You see the best in me 
(Forever) 
We were meant to be 
'ause I know it You to hold on to 

Love see us through 
Because of you Love see us through 
Through and through 
This love is strong enough for two 

Strong enough coz our lines are tough 
We've been together 'cause love's no bluff 
All you sexy laydies put your hands in the air 
Slam your body down like you just don't care

'Cause I know it 
Yes I know there's always you to hold on to
