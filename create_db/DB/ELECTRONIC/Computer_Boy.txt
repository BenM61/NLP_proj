Boy, boy, boy, boy

I'm in love with my favorite toy
Can't go a day without Computer Boy
I smile at him while I turn him on
I'm so happy until Computer's gone

I don't care and I won't change myself
I don't want anybody else

I fell in love with the man of the future
I've got a thing for my laptop computer
I'm so in love with the man of the future
The only one that brings me joy is my computer boy
(Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy)

I'm trying not to get attached to you (attached to you)
But no one else gets me like you do (like you do)
When you glow on my face you make me come alive
I want your floppy disk to be my hard drive

I don't care and I won't change myself
I don't want anybody else

I fell in love with the man of the future
I've got a thing for my laptop computer
I'm so in love with the man of the future
The only one that brings me joy is my computer boy

(Ooh, ooh oh ooh, ooh, ooh oh ooh)
Don't ever leave me or go to sleep without me
(Ooh, ooh oh ooh, ooh, ooh oh ooh)
Please stay by my side forever and never talk to anyone else
(Ooh, ooh oh ooh, ooh, ooh oh ooh)
My dearest (boy, boy, boy, boy, boy)
Computer Boy (boy, boy, boy, boy, boy)

I don't care and I won't change myself
I don't want anybody else
No, I don't plan to change myself
To be with anybody
(Computer Boy)
