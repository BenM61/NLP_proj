Scenes of dying light
Everywhere through a firecracker summer
Suddenly alone in a beehive
With a spider crawling along my spine

Blue water down from the mountains
Washed across the killing floor
Blood rushing up from a fountain
Can't undo a thing no more
I drag my chair to the window
And listen to the swarm

Beehive
Beehive
Honey just gets me stoned when I'm living
Bell rung
And stung
Honey just gets me stoned
Just gets me stoned

Scenes of dying love
In my head buzzed as a bees nest
Hanging down from above
Everywhere I look, it's a bummer

Gasoline in cool, cool water
I'm lying on a cooling board
Lightning coming out of the speakers
I wanna hear that sound some more
Press my body against the window
In an electric storm

Beehive
Beehive
Honey just gets me stoned when I'm living
Bell rung
And stung
Honey just gets me stoned
Just gets me stoned

Beehive
Beehive
Honey just gets me stoned when I'm living
Beehive
Beehive
Honey just gets me stoned
Just gets me stoned
Honey just gets me stoned
