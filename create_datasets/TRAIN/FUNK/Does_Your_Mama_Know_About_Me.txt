Does your mama know about me?
Does she know just what I am?
Will she turn her back on me

Or accept me as a man?
And what about your Dad?
Did you think of what he'll say?
Will he be understanding
Or does he think the usual way?
Maybe I shouldn't worry
But I've been through this before
And I'd like to get things straight
Before I'm knocking on your door

Does your mama know about me?
Does she know just what I am?
If she says forget about me

Do you think you'd understand?
And what about your friends?
Do you care what people say?
Will you accept the burdons
I know will surely come your way?
Maybe I shouldn't worry
But I've been through this before
And I'd like to get things straight
Before I'm knocking on your door

Does your mama know about me?
Does she know just what I am?
Will she turn her back on me?

Or accept me as a man?
We've got to stand tall
Can't stumble or crawl
We've got to be strong
For love that's so right
Can't be wrong
And every day I see it grow
And I don't want to let it go
I guess that's why I gotta know

Does your mama know about me?
Does your mama know about me?
Does your mama know about me?
Does your mama know about me?
Does your mama know about me?
