Every now and then
There's a longing in my heart,
Every now and then
Ever since we've been apart.
You don't know how much I miss you,
How I long to kiss you
Every now and then.

But every now and then,
I keep wondering how you are
And asking everyone,
"Are you happy where you are?"
What's the good of my denying?
I find myself a'crying
Every now and then.

But every now and then
I kiss your photograph,
The one you autographed, 
"I love you dearly."
And time and time again
I read each tender note
On which your fingers wrote,
"I love you sincerely."

Every now and then 
In my lonely reverie
While I think of you,
Do you ever think of me?
Is the spark of love still burning?
Do you long for my returning
Every now and then?

Every now and then
In my lonely reverie
While I think of you,
Do you ever think of me?
Is the spark of love still burning?
Do you long for my returning
Every now and then?
Every now and then.
