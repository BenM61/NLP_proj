There's a man who sells balloons
Pretty coloured toy balloons
He'll be coming round your way
So watch for him today

There's a fairy tale he tells
With each toy balloon he sells
Of a pretty magic world
For every boy and girl

He has red ones, and white ones, and blue ones and green
He's got the prettiest balloons you've ever seen
He's got big ones and small ones and some in between
To suit every little child's dream

It's a wondrous sight to see
For the children laugh with glee
When he lets them all go free
He's pretty toy balloons
Balloons, balloons, balloons

La-la-la-la Lah-la-lah, La-la-la-la Lah-la-lah
La-la-la-la Lah-la-lah, La-la-la La-la Lah

La-la-la-la Lah-la-lah, La-la-la-la Lah-la-lah
La-la-la-la Lah-la-lah, La-la-la La-la Lah
Balloons, balloons, balloons
Flying up so high
Go way up in the sky (fade)
