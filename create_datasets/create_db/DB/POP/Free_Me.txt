Being with you
Longing for something to happen
Biting my tongue
Hoping to get a reaction
Atmosphere's tense
Happy with anticipation
Don't leave me here
With only my imagination

Free me

Now free me
Let me loose to love you
Yeah how I long to seduce you oh
Free me
Let me loose to love you
Yeah how I long to seduce you now

How long can I
Continue to suffer in silence
My aching heart
Can't bear to wait in such suspense
So maybe its time
To tell you just how I am feeling
Cause for undesire
I have too long been concealing

Free me

Now free me
Let me loose to love you
Yeah how I long to seduce you oh
Free me
Let me loose to love you
Yeah how I long to seduce you now

Free me
Free Me

Now free me
Let me loose to love you
Yeah how I long to seduce you oh
Free me
Let me loose to love you
Yeah how I long to seduce you now
