You tore the ground in two
And limped away
You couldn't say
And what on earth to do
It came up (?)

I'm in, I'm out, underground
I found a crown all buried down
Underneath, you know I don't believe you
When you say those words, I can't do it

For every point of view
It all lets up
And I won't let up
I want to start anew
I'm running the hard way

All we need is a hundred acres
And a row of seed
All we need is a hundred acres
And some room to breathe

I'm in, I'm out, underground
I found a crown all buried down
Underneath, you know I don't believe you
When you say those words, I can't do it

No, I can't, I can't do it
I can't
(Do it)
(?)
