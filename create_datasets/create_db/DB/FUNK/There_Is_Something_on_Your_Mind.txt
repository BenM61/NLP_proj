There is something on your mind, by the way you look at me
There is something on your mind, pretty baby, by the way you look at me
Can what you're thinking bring hapiness, or will it bring misery
No, no, please don't try to tell me, 'cause I may not understand
No, no, you don't have to tell me, pretty baby, 'cause I may not understand
You want me to try and forget you, but I'll do the best I can
If you ever think about me, if I ever cross your mind
Yeah, yeah, if you ever think about me, pretty baby, if I ever cross your mind
Well you know, you know I'm yours, and I know, I know you're mine
