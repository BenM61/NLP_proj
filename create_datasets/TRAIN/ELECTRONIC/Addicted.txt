Have I told you how good
It feels to be me
When I'm in you
I can only stay clean
When you are around
Don't let me fall, oh no

If I close my eyes forever
Would it ease the pain
Could I breath again 

Baby I'm addicted, I'm out of control (out of control)
But you're the drug that keeps me from dying (dying)
Maybe I'm a lair but all I really know
Is you're the only reason I'm trying (trying)

I'm wasting away
I made a million mistakes
Am I too late?
There's a storm in my head
And it rains on my bed
When you're not here
I'm not afraid of dying
But I am afraid of losing you

Baby I'm addicted and out of control
But you're the drug that keeps me from dying
Maybe I'm a lair but all I really know
Is you're the only reason I'm trying

When you're lying next to me
Love is going through to me
Oh it's beautiful

Everything is clear to me
'Till I hit reality
And I lose it all
I lose it all
I lose it all, I lose it all

'Cause you're the only reason
Yeah you're the only reason I'm trying
Baby I'm addicted
I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying
Baby I'm addicted
Don't want to lose it all
Baby I'm all lair but all I really know
Is you're the only reason I'm trying (I'm trying, I'm trying)

Yeah, you know I'm addicted
You know I'm addicted
Yeah, you know I'm addicted
(Nuh, nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh)
