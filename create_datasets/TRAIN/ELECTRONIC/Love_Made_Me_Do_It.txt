I've took the fast lane all of my life
I've been a bad girl, I've been the good wife
I don't stop to think, when I go in, I go in
I've fallen hard like a million times
On number seven of my nine lives
The ink on my skin, is all the places I've been

Oh my God (oh my God), I'm such a sucker (I'm such a sucker)
I fall in love (I fall in love) with every fucker (mm hmm)
But oh no, I won't apologize
Nah, 'cause I'm

Breaking all my rules
But love made me do it
Shoulda used my head
'Cause my heart really blew it
Love made me do it (it wasn't my fault)
Love made me do it (it wasn't my fault)
And now I'm
Losing all my cool
But love made me do it
Shoulda used my head
'Cause my heart really blew it
Love made me do it (it wasn't my fault)
Love made me do it 
And I'd do it again

Yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Love made me do it and I'd do it again

I did my time on the yellow brick road
I saw some shit that'd make your head explode
Had to do what I do, just to get me to you
And all my friends are like, "Whoa, girl stop"
'Cause they're the ones who pick the pieces up
It's bad for my health but I just can't help myself

Oh my God (oh my God), I'm such a sucker (I'm such a sucker)
I fall in love (I fall in love) with every fucker (mm hmm)
But oh no, I won't apologize
Nah, 'cause I'm

Breaking all my rules
But love made me do it
Shoulda used my head
'Cause my heart really blew it
Love made me do it (it wasn't my fault)
Love made me do it (it wasn't my fault)
And now I'm
Losing all my cool
But love made me do it
Shoulda used my head
'Cause my heart really blew it
Love made me do it (it wasn't my fault)
Love made me do it
And I'd do it again

Yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Love made me do it and I'd do it again

I'm not gonna justify
Why I wanna change my mind
'Cause I'm a lover, not a hater
Sure as hell won't take no blame for my behaviour
No, I'm not gonna justify
Why I wanna change my mind
'Cause I'm a lover, not a hater
Sure as hell won't take no blame for my behaviour

Breaking all my rules
But love made me do it
Shoulda used my head
'Cause my heart really blew it
Love made me do it (it wasn't my fault)
Love made me do it (it wasn't my fault)
And now I'm

But love made me do it

Love made me do it
And I'd do it again

Yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Love made me do it and I'd do it again
