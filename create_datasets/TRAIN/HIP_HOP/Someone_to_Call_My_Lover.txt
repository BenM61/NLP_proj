Back on the road again
Feeling kinda lonely
And looking for the right guy
To be mine

Friends say I'm crazy cause
Easily I fall in love
You gotta do it different J
This time

Maybe we'll meet at a bar
He'll drive a funky car
Maybe we'll meet at a club
And fall so deeply in love
He'll tell me I'm the on
And we'll have so much fun
I'll be the girl of his dreams maybe

Alright maybe gonna find him today
I gotta get someone to call my lover
Yeah baby come on
Alright baby come in
Pass my way
I gotta get someone to call my lover
Yeah baby come on

I E YI

I spoil them when I'm in love
Given them what they dream of
Sometimes it's not a good thing
But I'm blind

I love hard with everything
Giving my all
More than they
I'll take my friends' advice this time
I'll do it differently

Maybe we'll meet at a bar
He'll drive a funky car
Maybe we'll meet at a club
And fall so deeply in love
He'll tell me I'm the on
And we'll have so much fun
I'll be the girl of his dreams maybe

Alright maybe gonna find him today
I gotta get someone to call my lover
Yeah baby come on
Alright baby come in
Pass my way
I gotta get someone to call my lover
Yeah baby come on

My my
Looking for a guy guy
I don't want him too shy
But he's gotta have the qualities
That I like in a man
Strong, smart, affectionate
He's gotta be all for me
And I'll be too
You see happily

Maybe we'll meet at a bar
He'll drive a funky car
Maybe we'll meet at a club
And fall so deeply in love
He'll tell me I'm the on
And we'll have so much fun
I'll be the girl of his dreams maybe

Alright maybe gonna find him today
I gotta get someone to call my lover
Yeah baby come on
Alright baby come in
Pass my way
I gotta get someone to call my lover
Yeah baby come on
