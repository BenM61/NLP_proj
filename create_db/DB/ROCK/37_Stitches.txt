Do you see me sitting here?
I'm waiting for you to say anything
Head hung low, kicking stones down
Kicking stones down the road to hell now
I'm waiting for you to say anything, anything, yeah

I know you are the only one
My little taste of heaven
You know I am the only one
Your bitter taste of hell

Your eyes scream the end is creeping in
I'll need thirty-seven stitches to keep the pain in
I know you are the only one
On the darkest side of the sun
On the darkest side of the sun, ooh yeah

Followed the piper's sweet whistling
Guided down the path by the wrong hand
Close my eyes for the chance of a better view
Close my ears so I couldn't hear you

And I know you are the one
And you know I am the one
Your bitter taste of hell

I know you are the only one
A little taste of heaven
And you know I am the only one
Your bitter taste of hell

Your eyes scream the end is creeping in
I'll need thirty-seven stitches, to keep the pain in
I know you are the only one
On the darkest side of the sun

Do you see me sitting here?
Still waiting for you to say anything
Head hung low kicking stones down
Kicking stones down the road to hell now
I'm waiting for you, I'm waiting for you, just say anything, yeah

I know you are the only one
A little taste of heaven
And you know I am the only one
Your bitter taste of hell

Your eyes scream the end is creeping in
I'll need thirty-seven stitches, thirty-seven stitches, yeah
I know you are the only one
On the darkest side of the sun

I know, I know, the darkest side of the sun
You are the one on the darkest side of the sun
