Come on, people, come on, children
Come on down to the glory river.
Gonna wash you up, and wash you down, 
Gonna lay the devil down, gonna lay that devil down.
I got fury in my soul,fury's gonna take me to the glory goal 
In my mind I can't study war no more.
Save the people, save the children, save the country now

Come on, people come on, children 
Come on down to the glory river 
Gonna wash you up and wash you down 
Gonna lay the devil down, gonna lay that devil down

Come on people! Sons and mothers 
Keep the dream of the two young brothers 
Gonna take that dream and ride that dove

We could build the dream with love, I know, 
We could build the dream with love, I know, 
We could build a dream with love, children, 
We could build the dream with love, oh people,
We could build the dream with love, I know,
We could build the dream with love.

Come on, people! Come on, children!
There's a king at the glory river

And the precious king, he loved the people to sing;
Babes in the blinkin' sun sang
"We Shall Overcome".
