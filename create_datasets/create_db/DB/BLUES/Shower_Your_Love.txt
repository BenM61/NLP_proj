Shower your love on me
Don't make it so hard to cry
Shower your love on me
You don't need a reason why

'Cause I'm not even half the way there
But I'm just too stupid to care
So help me now
When I've fallen through

There are scenes in my open mind
Confusion and flashing lights
Shower your love on me
'Cause nothing here feels right

'Cause I'm not even half the way there
But I'm just too stupid to care
So help me now
When I've done all I can do

Shower your love on me
I can't wait; I'm losing faith
Like we might just explode
Comfort me with a melody

Show me that I'm gonna know the answer
Show me that I'm gonna know

Shower your love on me
Don't make it so hard to cry
Shower your love on me
You don't need a reason why
Don't make it so hard to cry
Shower your love on me
Shower your love on me
