When you're feeling down and you're all alone
There's a little lady you can telephone
When she knocks on your door makes your heart stand still
You give her the money, she gives you the thrill

She got what you want
She got what you need
It's the feelgood factor and it's guaranteed
Feelgood factor
She got the feelgood factor
Feelgood factor

Whatever you want, she don't care
She got the stock and she'll give you a share
It's a take-over bid your deposit is due
And if your credit is good she'll play footsies with you
She'll take you round the world and bring you back again
Deals in pounds or dollars or marks or yen
She goes in at the bottom and out at the top
And she keeps on going till your profits drop

She got what you want
She got what you need
It's the feelgood factor and it's guaranteed
Feelgood factor
She got the feelgood factor
Feelgood factor
