My mama told me she didn't like that rock and roll
I said, "Please, Mama, please, Mama you just don't know I don't want
(Shoop-bop, shoop-bop) hang up my rock and roll shoes"
You know I get that feelin' ev'ry time I hear those blues
(Shoop-bop, shoop-bop)

That music's got a beat that will keep you alive
The kids are rock and rollin' from 8 to 25
I don't want (shoop-bop, shoop-bop) hang up my rock and roll shoes
Because I get that feelin' ev'ry time I hear those blues
(Shoop-bop, shoop-bop)

Yes, I will do my homework
Clean the yard every day
Yes, I will wipe those dishes
I'll do anything you say

They say that rock and roll will soon fade away
No matter what they say, rock and roll is here to stay 
I don't want(shoop-bop, shoop-bop) hang up my rock and roll shoes
(shoop-bop, shoop-bop)because my feet start movin' ev'ry time I hear those blues
(shoop-bop, shoop-bop)
