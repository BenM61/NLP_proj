It's a halfway 'til morning
Just got off the phone
Shipping forecast on my radio
I feel like a pirate on this stormy night
Where pirates steal and hold on tight

And I want you
And I need to wait

Remember the birds at montmartre
They were screaming in their apartment trees
Well I'm just so out of body now
Out of window and onto the street
Will you linger here forever and never leave

And I want you
And I need to wait

Elvis waits
In his waiting room
By his winnebago in wings and collar
He's a homogram he's no ordinary man
He flies on the wings of a wedding dove

And I want you
And I need to wait
