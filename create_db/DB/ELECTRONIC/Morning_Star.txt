Baby when I'm Falling asleep,
I think about you, do you think about me?
Tell me if you wanna get close,
closer to the fire, closer to me
I could be your Morning Star
If only we could have one night alone
I'm sick of sitting by myself,
waiting by the telephone

Ooo, let me be the one you call when you go down
Boy I'll pick you up and give you the love that gave me the life,
in the full moon light
Don't you wanna gimme tonight?
Ooo, shine on me and help me catch the Morning Star,
Boy I'll pick you up and give you the love that gave me the life,
in the full moon light
Don't you wanna gimme tonight?

In case you ever wonder 'bout me,
I'm still here, don't be shy
I'm thinkin' 'bout you baby,
what will it be? tell me your right
I could be your Morning Star
You never even gave it half a chance
I'm sick of sitting by myself,
Waiting for the final dance

Ooo, let me be the one you call when you go down
Boy I'll pick you up and give you the love that gave me the life,
in the full moon light
Don't you wanna gimme tonight?
Ooo, shine on me and help me catch the Morning Star,
Boy I'll pick you up and give you the love that gave me the life,
in the full moon light
Don't you wanna gimme tonight?
