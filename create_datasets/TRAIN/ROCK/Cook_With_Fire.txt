C'mon, c'mon, I said c'mon

This hot night wind is mine, I know
This gust of love ain't no liar
Steamed up, blown up, stoked from below
I'm a ready to cook with fire, ooh with fire

Yeah (Incomprehensible)

She cattin' around to catch you, man
And butters you up to buy her
Darlin', she's just a flash in the pan
And now don't you wanna cook him with fire?

I'm talkin' 'bout kickin' the role thing, yeah
I wanna give you the whole thing, yeah

Ooh, listen, she gonna burn ya
I tell ya, she gonna make you a fool
But it'll help ya learn yeah
Way, way better than school

I got the soul that's got the spark for ya
Holdin' a real hot wire
You got a hungry flame in the dark
And Lord, we gonna cook it with fire

I got the soul that's got the spark for ya
Holdin' a real hot wire, yeah
We got a hungry flame in the dark
And Lord, we gonna cook it with fire

Oh, listen to me
