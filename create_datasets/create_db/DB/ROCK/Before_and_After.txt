The dust settles after a hit and run 
Bewildered by the damage done 
I don't know why we chose the roads we travel 
Or how a life could get so unraveled 

[Chorus: x2]
We live our lives from then until now 
By the mercy received and the marks on our brow 
To my heart I'll collect what the four winds will scatter 
And frame my life into before and after 
Once a trick of light made me believe 
A red fire was blazing from every tree 
We held hands as the evening gathered 
I forgave myself for what I didn't ask her 
I once saw the sky filled with falling stars 
Bumped my head in the dark and it left a scar 
Held on too tight before I let it go 
Then forgave myself for what I didn't know 

I've stretched my soul over fifty states 
I have lived on fumes and religious cornflakes 
And once I dreamt my shoe had grown thin and battered 
And forgave myself for what didn't matter 
God said Cain where is your brother 
And who will tell his grieving mother 
Jacob dreamt an angel called his name 
And he never was quite the same 

[Chorus]
