Fading
We're all fading
From who we've become and who we were meant to be
Dying
We're all dying
And wanna believe it's everyone but me
Oh great light of the world help us see

What can save us now
When hands are reaching out
Walls are falling down
It's a love revolution
And what can save us now
It's raising from the ground
We are crying out
For a love revolution

Searching,
We're all searching
For something more divine to set us free
Holding
We're all holding
Everything inside this world needs, yeah
Oh great light of the world help us see

What can save us now
When hands are reaching out
Walls are falling down
It's a love revolution

And what can save is now
It's raising from the ground
We are crying out
For a love revolution

We are called to freedom
We are free to love
And love has come for us
Love will be enough

What can save us now
When hands are reaching out
And walls are falling
Down down down
Oh, oh,
Hands are reaching out
And walls are falling down
It's a love revolution
Oh, oh,
It's raising from the ground
And we are crying out
For a love revolution
We need a love a revolution
It's a love revolution
Help us see
We need a love revolution

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
