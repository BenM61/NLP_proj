Knock me out
Girl, you know, you knock me out
Girl, you know, you knock me out
Girl you know, you knock me out

Summer bunnies drive me crazy (summer bunnies drive me crazy)
Summer bunnies drive me crazy (I'm in love the way you knock me out)
Summer bunnies drive me crazy (girl you drive me crazy)
Summer bunnies drive me crazy (summer bunnies drive me crazy)

One, two, three, four it's time for me to jet
Where you goin' off to, the beach, that's a bet
It's summertime so it's time to get a summer
These summers, goes and I won't call them, hoes

'Cause in the 90's you gotta respect the ladies
So step up to 'em and say, we love you sweet Sadie
That's how you get your true mock on but
Brothers be steppin' up poppin' that sad song

Hey don't I know you from somewhere?
Can we go somewhere to be alone?
I pull up in the lot, pop the trunks make their heads bob
And it's sunny so it's time to get a summer bunny

Summer bunnies drive me crazy (you know you drive me crazy)
Summer bunnies drive me crazy (girl you got it goin' on)
Summer bunnies drive me crazy (summer bunnies drivin' me)
Summer bunnies drive me crazy (I really love the way you drivin' me)

Uh, it's five o'clock and my voice code is twenty two
So beep, beep, beep it's time for me to make a move
I'm on my way to his picnic
Ay, Joa we got time to go and start this shit, yeah
But I wanna be early, fool
So I can catch the new bunnies comin' in just like the old school
Strollin' the block so I can check the scenery
The sun's blazin', the day is feelin' good to me
I can just smell the funky beats
You know the flavor in between the sheets

I saw my boy Big Al, said Just keep it straight
He said, I know I got a novelty to validate
So who's the bunny lookin' sweet like a honeycomb?
He said, no my brother, you got to get your own, summer bunny

Summer bunnies drive me crazy (summer bunnies drive me crazy)
Summer bunnies drive me crazy (girl you know you knock me out)
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
Summer bunnies drive me crazy (I really love the way you drivin' me)

This party is packed tops, word to the mother
I love it when there's three bunnies to one brother
And wine coolers is what I'm packin'
And when I get my buzz on is when I start bunny-jackin'
Jackin' fools for their bunnies
'Cause I'm the K, the E, the double L, the Y they wanna get with me
And the PAs in the house (so what up?)
So check, check, check it out
My stomach is growlin' so it's time to get mine on
Some soul food, cool Aid and you know it's on
Then after that I hate to eat and run but I'm outty
My homie, Tamika invited us to a block party
So we roll up in all our summer style and daisy deuce
The brothers yellin', summer bunnies

Summer bunnies drive me crazy (summer bunnies drive me crazy)
Summer bunnies drive me crazy (and you know, you know you knock me out)
Summer bunnies drive me crazy (ay ay, crazy)
Summer bunnies drive me crazy (I really love the way you knock me out)

Let's break it down
Your're looking real good with your dukes on baby (baby)
Your're looking real good with your dukes on baby (oh yeah yeah)
Your're looking real good with your dukes on baby (oh baby)

Girl, you know you knock me out
