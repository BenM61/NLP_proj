The night was full of dancers 
Caught up in the light 
On a sea of lonely faces 
The ships pass in the night 

The air was full of magic 
The stars were in my eyes 
But when we started dancing 
There was only you and I 

We were meant to be lovers 
Candles in the night 
You and me eternally 
Until the end of time 

We were meant to be lovers 
Our flame will burn out bright 
It's written in the stars 
You were meant to be mine. 

Well, I know we've both been here before 
Love comes then it's gone 
So many midnight promises 
Get broken by the dawn 

And Heaven knows a candle glows 
Until it disappears 
So while our flame is burning bright 
Let's cast away our fears. 

We were meant to be lovers 
Candles in the night 
You and me eternally 
Until the end of time 

We were meant to be lovers 
Our flame will burn out bright 
It's written in the stars 
You were meant to be mine.
