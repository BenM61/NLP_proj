Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Alright yeah, alright

Sea lion woman, she drink coffee
She drink tea and then go home
Sea lion woman

Sea lion woman, dressed in green
Wears silk stockings with golden seams
Sea lion woman

Sea lion woman, dressed in red
Make a man lose his head
Sea lion woman

Sea lion woman, black dress on
For a thousand dollars, she wail and she moan
Sea lion woman

Wiggle, wiggle, turn like a cat
Wink at a man and he wink back
Now child, sea lion woman

Empty his pockets and wreck his days
Make him love her
And she'll fly away, yeah yeah

Sea lion woman, take it on out now
Empty his pockets and she wreck his days
And she make him love her
Then she sure fly away

She got a black dress on
For a thousand dollars
She wail and she moan
