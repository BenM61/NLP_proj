I can remember the night that we met down in Rio
It was a night full of stars and off thousand guitars
We couldn’t speak in a language we knew
We didn’t know how to say I love you
But in the morning we knew

Yeah, yeah, yeah
You’re a beautiful lover
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You’re a beautiful dream
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I don’t want any other
We don’t need words
I’ll always know what you mean

Night after night we were dancing and kissing the night away
It didn’t matter that we were from two different lands
I only knew it was heaven for me
Being with you is where I want to be
Close to you just holding hands

Yeah, yeah, yeah
You’re a beautiful lover
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You’re a beautiful dream
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I don’t want any other
We don’t need words
I’ll always know what you mean
I’ll always know what you mean
I’ll always know what you mean
