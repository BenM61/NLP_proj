In the beat hotel
The walls have ears
The beat goes on
A naked lunch
The cupboard's bare
A drummer drums
The message comes
The message:
Hey what's your name won't you take me to your room
Hey what's your name won't you take me to your room

In the beat hotel
A stolen glance
A bed of nails
The desk clerk smiles
He's dressed in red
A tarnished room
A furnished friend
Hey what's your name won't you take me to your room
Hey what's your name won't you take me to your room

Take me one hundred stories up to the moon
Take me one hundred stories up to the moon

In the beat hotel
I met a guy
Who wasn't real
His chequered past
Was just an act
Or just a style
Or just a lie
In the beat hotel
The walls have ears
The beat goes on
A naked lunch
The cupboard's bare
A drummer drums
The message comes
The message:
Hey what's your name won't you take me to your room
Hey what's your name won't you take me to your room...
