They say it's a river, that circles the earth
A beam of light shining to the edge of the universe
It conquers all, it changes everything

They say it's a blessing, they say it's a gift
They say it's a miracle
And I believe that it is
It conquers all, but it's a mystery

Love breaks your heart
Love takes no less than everything
Love makes it hard
And it fades away so easily

In this world we've created
Where this place that we lived
In a blink of an eye the darkness slips in
Love lights the world
Unites the love that's for eternity

Love brakes the chain
Love aches for everyone of us
Love takes the tears of pain, and it turns it in
To the beauty that remains

Look at this place
It was paradise, but now it's dying
I'll brave the love
I'll take, my chances that it's not too late

Love brakes your heart
Love takes no less than everything
Love makes it hard
And fades away so easily

Oh oh oh

Love brakes the chain
Love aches for everyone of us
Love takes the tears and the pain, and turns it in
To the beauty that remains
