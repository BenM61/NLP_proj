I don't know what you want from me
Or what you think a love ought to be
I want something that's open and strong
As the country this road's moving on

From the mountain to the valley
From the ocean to the alley
From the highway to the river
One emotion to deliver
One heart, one way, one love
To share but not to chain
That's freedom

It's a song of the heart
A race in the wind
A light in the dark
That's freedom

I don't know why it takes so long
To remember
What the world's doin' wrong
Never wanted to shove my plan on another
Who can't understand

All I want is a fast lane to
Where the road across this plain
Won't take you
I want something you understand
To make us stand proud
As nothing else can

It's a song of the heart
A race in the wind
A light in the dark
That's freedom

It's a measure of trust
When love is alive
It's tender and tough
That's freedom
It's all love is about
The opening up and letting it out
Let freedom ring
