Thought I understood
All the things that you told me
You were going through
Tried to be there, and wanted to pull you through
And show you how much you're loved

Made a song and dance
Whenever I would ask you
Just what was wrong
You would say something like: "nothing hon'"
All along telling me lies

If you really cared
Cared about me
Then you would care about
Care about us
If you cared about me
Then you would have cared about love

Felt betrayed
I was giving good loving
Yet still you strayed
Wasn't I good enough?
You were, oh, so sweet
I guess it was your sweetness
That blinded me

If you really cared
If you cared
You would be there for me
You wouldn't have left me feeling lonely
If you really cared
Then you would have cared about us
Cared about love

Said you cared
Now you're asking for forgiveness
It's much too late
I don't want you near
If you cared about me
Then you would have cared about love

If you really cared
Cared about me
Then you wouldn't have
Hurt me as you did
If you cared about me
Then you would have cared about love
