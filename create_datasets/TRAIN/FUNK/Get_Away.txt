I am here on this road
Knows me well
With my head on the wheel
And my heart on the floor

Trying through my tears
I'm no delicate flower
I'm wanting you near
Every minute each hour

Get away
Can't get away
Can't get away
Can't get away from you
(Ohh)
Get away
Can't get away
Can't get away
Can't get away from you

No space is sacred
Atomic, can I heal?
This frail unforgiving relentless
Defenseless invasion of fear

I hide in the sand
But the voices get louder
I do what I can
As the sea overpowers

Get away
Can't get away
Can't get away
Can't get away from you
(Ohh)
Get away
Can't get away
Can't get away
Can't get away from you

Get away
Can't get away
Can't get away
Can't get away from you
(Ohh)
Get away
Can't get away
Can't get away
Can't get away from you

I've been affected
(I've been affected)
Laa laa laa laa laa laa

I hide in the sand
But the voices get louder
I do what I can't
As the sea overpowers

Get away
Can't get away
Can't get away
Can't get away from you
(Ohh)
Get away
Can't get away
Can't get away
Can't get away from you

Get away
Can't get away
Can't get away
Can't get away from you
(Ohh)
Get away
Can't get away
Can't get away
Can't get away from you

I've been affected
(I've been affected)
I've been affected
(I've been affected)
