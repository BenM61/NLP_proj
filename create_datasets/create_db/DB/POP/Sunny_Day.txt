Tears fall from the sky
Like raindrops from your eyes
Tears fall from the sky
Like raindrops from your eyes

It only takes a sunny day
To find a way
It only takes a little time
To open up your mind

I wonder if you'll ever know
That love makes our spirit glow
I wonder if you'll ever know
That love makes our spirit glow

It only takes a sunny day
To find a way
It only takes a little time
To open up your mind, mind

Get on your knees and pray
The sun will shine one day
Get on your knees and pray
The sun will shine one day

It only takes a sunny day
To find a way
It only takes a little time
To open up your mind

It only takes a sunny day
To find a way
It only takes a little time
To open up your mind
To open up your mind
To open up your mind

It only takes a sunny day
To open up your mind
It only takes a little time
To open up your mind

I want to do it believe in me
To open up your mind
What a beautiful feeling
To open up your mind

It only takes a sunny day
It only takes a sunny day
It only takes a sunny day
It only takes a sunny day
