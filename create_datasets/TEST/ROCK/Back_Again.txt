Looking back upon my life I'm very thankful 
That your arm is not too short to rescue 
And deliver me 
Take my hand and lead me out and through 
Through the waters of the Red Sea
Through the blood and the death of the enemy 
While a new foe rages 
And holds up an image of a man that I used to be 

Throwing up my insides out 
On my knees before the throne 
Staring in the porcelain dome 
That flushes away all the high of last night's waste
And I will never forget the bad taste 
That was left inside my mouth 
Of when she left when I cried, when I died, no I ain't going 
Ain't goin' back again!
Ain't goin' back again!

Once I wasted, now I've tasted 
A better life 
More than I've ever known 
Once I wasted, now I've tasted 
A better life 
More than I've ever known 
Once I hated, now embraced it
A better life 
More than I've known

And I'm glad that the past is gone,

That I'm never gonna be alone
Cause I found true love
Even though that my number three finger is empty
And there's nothing I'd give in exchange 
For a love that strange 
From when she left when I cried when I died,
No ain't going back again! 
Ain't going back again!

Once I wasted, now I've tasted 
A better life 
More than I've ever known 
Once I wasted, now I've tasted 
A better life 
More than I've ever known 
Once I hated, now embraced it
A better life 
More than I've known

More than I've known
Once I wasted, now I've tasted 
A better life 
More than I've ever known 
Once I hated, now embraced it
A better life 
More than I've known
