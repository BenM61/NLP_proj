I don't want to hurt any more
I don't want to hurt like I did before
You only made me cry
Tried to change my mind

I don't want to feel insecure
And I don't want to feel like I can't be cured
Though you don't want me to
I'll get over you

I can't keep comin' back for one last try
Let history repeat itself this time
I've been takin' all the blame but
I'll never make the same mistake again

Won't be that fool runnin' back to you
I won't fall apart like I used to do
Enough is enough
You've hurt me too much

Won't be that fool who keeps holdin' on
I can't stay here when the feeling's gone
Enough is enough
You've hurt me too much

I'm all out of love
I know we've been through this before
I know we've been through every open door
Tryin' to find a way

Back to yesterday
Now you've got to follow your heart
And though it will lead us so far apart
Some things you've got to do

When love's hurtin' you
I can't keep comin' back for one last try
Let history repeat itself this time
I've been takin' all the blame but

I'll never make the same mistake again
Won't be that fool runnin' back to you
I won't fall apart like I used to do
Enough is enough

You've hurt me too much
Won't be that fool who keeps holding on
I can't stay here when the feeling's gone
Enough is enough

You've hurt me too much
I'm all out of love
Won't be that fool runnin' back to you
I won't fall apart like I used to do

Enough is enough 
You've hurt me too much
Won't be that fool runnin' back to you
I won't fall apart like I used to do

Enough is enough
You've hurt me too much
Won't be that fool who keeps holdin' on
I can't stay here when the feeling's gone

Enough is enough 
You've hurt me too much 
I'm all out of love
