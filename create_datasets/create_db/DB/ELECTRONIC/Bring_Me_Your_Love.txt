I don't want to spend my life in sorrow 
There's so many days and nights i got to get through 
I think of all the times we shared 
So sacred together. 

I think about my life without 
Someone like you 

Bring me your love 
Show me your heart 
Tell me you can't say no 
There's only so much time 
Before i lose my mind 
So bring me your love 

You ask me to be strong 
Hold on, it's hard to be patient 
I know you're at home 
Alone lying with him 
I'm burning deep inside 
My heart is twisting and turning 

You're all I've got 
I'll never stop caring for you. 

Bring me your love 
Show me your heart 
Tell me you can't say no 
There's only so much time 
Before i lose my mind 
So bring me your love 

Bring me your love 
Show me your heart 
Baby i can't let go 
I know you understand 
My life is in your hands 
So bring me your love 

Twisting and turning 
Twisting and turning 

So you don't think it matters? 
Well you're wrong, 
What do you want from me? 

Chorus repeat 

Bring me your love (bring) 
Show me your heart (bring) 

Chorus out
