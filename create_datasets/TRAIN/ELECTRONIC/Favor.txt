Yeah, I like it when we're on our own so
I keep you here when really I'm a loner
You know just what'll keep in the zone, yeah
You give me something real that I can feel
'Cause when we're high, oh we speak in silence
A language only we know
It's something sure about how you hold my hand
The more you pull, the higher we go

Really babe, you fucking with a vibe right now
I usually keep it pushing
I don't ever stick around
I move so swift they call me Taylor
But now you got me feeling easy like a lay up
We messing with feeling unknown right now
If I let you hit would I be wrong right now
You never really know where this will take us
I think I'm 'bout to do myself a favor

If I let you hit
Would I be wrong right now?

I'm already tripping
I know it's for real
You may be speechless but you know how it feels
You a thug
And that's what I love
That's what I like ooh
I ain't tryna be the one
To put you through it
Just know that you're not
Know that you're not alone
My eyes are low while I'm up in ya
Up in I'm your arms
The reason I feel right at home

Really babe, you fucking with a vibe right now
I usually keep it pushing
I don't ever stick around
I move so swift they call me Taylor
But now you got me feeling easy like a lay up
We messing with feeling unknown right now
If I let you hit would I be wrong right now
You never really know where this will take us
I think I'm 'bout to do myself a favor

If I let you hit
Would I be wrong right now?

Judging by your looks I know you want to
Oh no
The moment got you feeling like you on some
Oh no
Usually I smoke a little something with you
Sometimes
I just want to get the real you
Oh, oh
