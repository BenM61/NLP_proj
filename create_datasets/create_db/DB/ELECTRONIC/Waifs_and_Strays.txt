And so they say they're leaving
While you sleep away the day
You go out every evening
Collecting waifs and strays

They follow their illusions
They don't know what to do
They need a clear direction
That's why they turn to you

You're pleading
Please don't leave me
Don't go from me so soon
I need to be found
For I'm a stray too

Don't go
Just wait until tomorrow
Just wait until tomorrow
Just wait until tomorrow

On the streets of Paris
On the streets of Rome
They find a home
In shadow or in coffee bars
Down the winding alleys
Through the brightly lit arcades
No matter where they are

In and out of life they wander
Little waifs and strays
They stay until you fall in love
That's when they slip away

In the dark you'll see
Those sad brown eyes come shining through
Your heart will melt
You felt the way they looked at you

Don't go
Just wait until tomorrow
Just wait until tomorrow
Just wait until tomorrow

You find you need someone
To love your days away
Just when your heart is crying out
Please stay
Don't go away

Just wait until tomorrow
Just wait until tomorrow
Just wait until tomorrow
Just wait until tomorrow

Yes it's true
I'm a stray too
