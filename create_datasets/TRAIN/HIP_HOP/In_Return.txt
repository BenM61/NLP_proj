Tell me just what you want in return
You never know what I'm thinking babe
Tell me what you want
I might want the same

It's been a while
Since I've had somebody who really cares about me
And then came you
Everything was cool
And it seemed just like loved me loved me no
But lately I've been feeling like
You're trying to buy me things to keep me
Under your wing no
I questioned you because
The things you buy outweigh the love so

Tell me just what you want in return
I just got to know what you really want
Come on and keep it real you ain't gonna front
Tell me just what you want in return
Boy you never know what I'm thinking babe
Tell me what you want
I might want the same

Boy is it love or is it games yeah
If so then things have got to change
We've come this far
And it's a shame
If you're just looking for one thing
But if it's love then we'll remain
It's not about material things
I don't need no ring to love you
Boy I love you anyway

Tell me just what you want in return
I just got to know what you really want
Come on and keep it real you ain't gonna front
Tell me just what you want in return
Boy you never know what I'm thinking babe
Tell me what you want
I might want the same

Tell me just what you want in return
Boy you never know what I'm thinking babe
Tell me what you want
I might want the same

Whatever you do for me
Make sure it's from the heart
And we won't fall apart baby
'cause honesty's the only key
To loving me ooh

So say what's on your mind
Don't hold it all inside
I might like what you're trying to hide baby
And everything will be alright
If you just

Tell me just what you want in return
I just got to know what you really want
Come on and keep it real you ain't gonna front
Tell me just what you want in return
Boy you never know what I'm thinking babe
Tell me what you want
I might want the same

Repeat
