I'm a hustler, baby
That's what my daddy's made me
Yeah, I'm a hustler, baby
That's what my daddy's made me

I'm a hustler, baby
That's what my daddy's made me
Yeah, I'm a hustler, baby
That's what my daddy's made me

I'm a hustler, baby
That's what my daddy's made me
Yeah, I'm a hustler, baby
That's what my daddy's made me

If I had the money to go
To a record store I would, I, I would
If I had the money to go
To a record store I would, I, I would

Go to the record store
Go to the record store
Go to the record store
Put the records in my clothes

Go to the record store
Go to the record store
(Incomprehensible) record
Go past that record man

Go to a record store
Put it in my clothes
And walk past that record man
Got to have the sticky hands

Your ass is broke
Your ass is broke
Like me, like me

Go to that record store
Steal some record, man
Go to that record store
Steal some records, man

I'm telling you I'm broke
I'm telling you I'm broke
But I'm surviving and
And I can cope

Yeah, I'm a hustler, baby
That's what my daddy's made me
Yeah, I'm a hustler, baby
That's what my daddy's made me

Yeah, I'm a hustler, baby
That's what my daddy's made me
Yeah, I'm a hustler, baby
That's what my daddy's made me

Gotta do what you gotta do
To survive
Gotta take what you gotta take
To stay alive

Gotta do what you gotta do
To survive
Gotta make what you gotta make
To stay alive

It's 8 o' clock
And I got nothing to do
Can't go to the club

So I guess I'll go to the record store
Visit my record man
With my sticky hands

Walk out that record door
Put your records in my clothes
The records in my clothes

What the f*ck is you gonna do?
What the f*ck is you gonna do
About it? Nothing

Push it, push it, push it, push it
Push it, push it, push it, push it
Push it, push it, push it, push it
Push it, push it, push it, push it
