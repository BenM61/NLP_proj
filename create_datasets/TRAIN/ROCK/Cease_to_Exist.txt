I would drag myself through a mile of broken glass
Just to watch you cease to exist

Lights out, go to sleep, I hope you never wake up
I want nothing more than to 

Destroy the moment in time that you came to life
I'm here to banish you
Now a hex on your life, sent to your death
I'm her to punish you, banish you
I would drag myself through a mile of broken glass
Just to watch you cease to exist

Knowing that your kind of grime 
Has a place nested inside our world

I understand that your chance to live is trying to die
I will help you 

Destroy the moment in time that you came to life
I'm here to banish you
Now a hex on your life, sent to your death
I'm her to punish you, banish you

I am here to banish you
I am here to punish you
I am here to banish you
Lights out, go to sleep, I hope you never wake up
I want nothing more than to 

Destroy the moment in time that you came to life
I'm here to banish you
Now a hex on your life, sent to your death
I'm her to punish you, banish you
I would drag myself through a mile of broken glass
Just to watch you cease to exist
I would drag myself through a mile of broken glass
Just to watch you cease to exist

Cease to exist

I would drag myself Hell
I would drag myself Hell
Just to watch you cease to exist
