When the white azaleas start blooming
I'll come back to you
When spring's in the air with its freshness so rare
We'll make our dreams come true

When the white azaleas start blooming
Up in those mountains so high
We'll build a nest where we'll find happiness
Sweetheart for only you and I

(When the white azaleas start blooming
I'll come back to you)
When spring's in the air with its freshness so rare
We'll make our dreams come true

When the white azaleas start blooming
(When the white azaleas start blooming)
