I'm trying to understand why
Like a black hole in the sky
Your love is consuming my nights, my life
You're a singularity

A door opening on a new dimension
The stars and suns disappear
The whole universe lives in fear
Wiped off into nothingness, erased

Like a fantastic good-bye
Defying even my imagination
It's another time
And it's another space

It's something that science can't describe
No one has ever seen
No one has ever been
A black hole in the sky, why?

Like a black hole in the sky
You crush me from your universe
What you want you just erase without trace
Like a fantastic good-bye

Your passion is stranger than my, science fiction
It's another time
And ifs another space
It's something that science can't describe

No one has ever seen
No one has ever been
A black hole in the sky, why?
Like a black hole in the sky

Your love is consuming my life
Like a new world in reverse
A daughter in a new universe
A cosmic brain hard to explain

Another time another space
Something nobody can erase
Like a fantastic good-bye
