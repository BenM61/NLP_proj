I've seen you darling, seen you hanging round town
You in a short skirt, shining eyes of deep brown
You had a dirty look, you caught me on your hook
Turn up the thermostat, I want to see you sweat 
Oh yeah, girl, you've got something I like

I walked right over, said hi, how ya doin'?
You smiled at me and girl you tore right through me
I said come on let's dance, we've got to take our chance
You whispered in my ear, you want to get out of here 

Can you feel it? Rocking the city
Ah yeah, straight out of nowhere-ness
Like a fist, can't resist you, oh no
I tell you something 

You know I love ya, just want to touch ya
Stand up, knock me right off my feet
Hard to beat
Hard to beat
Hard to beat 

Let's spend the night, spend the night together
Heart beating so fast, as you take my shirt off
This girl I saw round town, well now she's going down
Stuck on a losing streak, I think you've turned it round 

Oh yeah, girl, you've got something I like

Read all about it, have you heard the latest?
Boy in a band, Babe actress
But baby, you and me, we came up from the street
No time to hesitate, we've got to push our weight 

Can you feel it? Rocking the city
Ah yeah, straight out of nowhereness
Like a fist, can't resist you, oh no
I tell you something 

You know I love ya, just want to touch ya
Stand up, knock me right off my feet
Hard to beat
Hard to beat
Hard to beat 

Goodness
No, I've never known a night like this
Can't believe it, you're so hard to beat
Hard to beat 

Drive me crazy, my beautiful baby
Let's spend the whole day right here together 

You know I love ya, just want to touch ya
Stand up, knock me right off my feet
Hard to beat
Hard to beat
Hard to beat 

Oh yeah, girl, you've got something I like
Oh yeah, girl, you've got something I like
