I get Krystal Karrington, ice rock gritty
Carly doh on flowin tea flashers, Acapolco how my sign seen
Second to catch it
First I feel it when I peel it
In the hall wit my orchestra, orchestratin my plans

Gifted Caramela, cinderella hold a fella tight
Make the octopussy do tha why to see for the night
Call me by first name - Cheeba, sip the tang divas
In my sinasex get the intersect, it's the kid
But she make me want to holla pass a dollar wit glass
Sucky, sucky for the nookie, meditatin on that arse
Doc that feel good, but it feel good when I splash
Get me high make me eat the hunky pie, Seaworld

We gone navigate the underground, blammin out Metropolis
Higher rock to this said the 85 I take my steez
Turnin towards Kahlua, knew I shouldn't a ran it through
And I should clean my shadow, any in that ego
We could take it to the Lugers, Cheeba make them unfold
Took my scammer s'now old, meditate on this one
Check I'm freezin wit the flame I put the blame on tough job
Generatin low life, Geechi Suede see'est la vie

Shook it off, now start to say one Bogart
Caca, Caca convince her and bulletproof heart
Its swift ice burglins on clips don't slip
They shift the diamonds we suck on my crew and lucky stips

Above the aquapool, hovercrafts teleport my lubricant
Golden axe, who's the drunken monk, uno delegate
Margarita glinch, lyric cannon out my trench
Welcome back to Fairy, Sonny Cheeba out garden

(Count to ten) I freaks my porter bloody peaks in
Don't theme the pimps for his devil ment (f*ck that)
Need this, game genie pourin me a weeny and a buttist
Sustain that gain while I free fall
(Lets do this) Hoppin, sat in not jivin
Hijackin trains like (everybody get some)
Its like that ho height, elephants speak up
Down the wino Jones in pardon if I break up

Protectin east give the signals, got my henchman a mail ya
Convincin Kashmir runnin cat scans on sequence
Then we Shalamar assassinate the seminar
Simarotta symphony hit the ball flee the globe
Dynamo dinero, crusade genie casino
Cheeba ride the rhino, royal rubies at Reno
Venezuela electric, twistin trees Tahiti
Forty these a terror that ever belongs to Suede

(Crash) Tell a tubby 'cause Angelica is tellin a
Cash sarratoga, Fahrenheit is flat, f*ck the die
End of year for this Kashmir, Suede shit bro
Microwavin yo ass, and meltin in yo mouth, like
