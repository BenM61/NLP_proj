Anything we should know about your change? 
Bleached black from the smile
On a glimpse of your face
Yeah I ran to her
Blame it on me
That inevitable date
You remember her

I'm putting it off
And I can't control fate
'Cause we're similar
I blame it on you
'Cause that side of me I hate
But you were never hurt

I'm putting it off
And I can't control fate
Yeah I ran to her
Blame it on me
That inevitable game
But you were never hurt
