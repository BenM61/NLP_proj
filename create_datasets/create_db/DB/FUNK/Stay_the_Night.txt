Sometimes I wonder what to say
Especially when you are here with me
I'll admit I get this nervous feelin'
I never wanted it to show what you do to me

So now I won't deny the truth today
I really wanna show you what you mean to me
Please lie here by my side
Won't you spend the night

If I tell you once, I tell you twice
Will you come and give it to me
Will you come and give it to me right

If I tell you once, I tell you twice
Will you come and do it to me
Will you come and do it to me right

I want you to take this time to see
That I'm more than just a pretty face
I handle myself with class and grace
And do you know how it feels to be
Secretly in love with somebody that you've known for so long

So I can't deny the truth anymore
I'm never gonna let you go
Won't let you off my door
Please lie here by my side
Say you'll spend the night

If I tell you once, I tell you twice
Will you come and give it to me
Will you come and give it to me right

If I tell you once, I tell you twice
Will you come and do it to me
Will you come and do it to me right

you're walkin', you're talkin'
You're eating, you're breathin'
You do it so right, everything right
You know I'm not dreaming, you are the true reason
I'm living my life 'cause love is so right

If I tell you once, I tell you twice
Will you come and give it to me
Will you come and give it to me right

If I tell you once, I tell you twice
Will you come and do it to me
Will you come and do it to me right
