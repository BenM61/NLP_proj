When you talk about choice
As if it's something we were born with
This choice is for some but not for everyone

And the way you talk about money
Like it's the currency of faith then cast aside
Those who never make the grade

In the back of my mind, there's a home for everyone
But in the cold light of day, it's a grim reality
You talk about freedom but I just don't understand
The castle that you've built is made out of sand

And the goods you sell are the ones we already own
And the lies you tell to build, you sacred home
It's a common misconceptions
They call single minded strength, I say it's just
Too easy to divide the us from them

Let's talk about it, it's your choice
Well, there's no choice at all people
It's you choice, no, no, no, no, no
It's you choice, well, there's no choice at all
It's you choice

Let's talk about hate 'cause it's something
That you thrive on, conquer and divide
Get on your bike and ride, is it such a disease?
It's something we all suffer from
You think it's heaven sent but it don't pay the rent

The way you talk about love like it's something you invented
But the only love you know is the one that makes the dough
With the 28 clauses and your market forces
You only benefit but you showing [unverified] baby

It's your choice, it's no choice at all, yeah
It's your choice, well, there's no choice at all people
It's you choice, no, no, no, no, no choice
It's you choice, ooh, choice?

The way you talk about it to me
Choice, no choice
The way you sat to me now people

It's no choice at all, it's no choice at all
It's no choice at all, you got it
It's no choice at all, it's no choice at all

It's your choice, well, there's no choice at all
It's you choice, no, no, no, no, no choice
It's you choice, well, that's no choice at all
It's you choice

Shodee do da do, da do dado, yeah
Da do dodo, da do dado
