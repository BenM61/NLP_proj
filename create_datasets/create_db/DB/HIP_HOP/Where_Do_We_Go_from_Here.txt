When you're in love
Some things you take for granted
Until someone pulls it apart
And leaves you with half of your heart
How do I trade 
The best I had for less
Without giving up
Should I slowly accept that we'll be no more than just friends

How do I know
When to let go
I know what I'm feeling inside
But part of me still wants to try

So tell me
Where do we go from here
Why's my heart filled with so much fear
When all that you are
Is all I need and more

There's no winning bets
The battle's just begun
I know it's over
But I still feel the same
You'll always remain number one

'Cause letting go
More and so much
I know what I'm feeling inside
But part of me still wants to try

So tell me
Where do we go from here
Why's my heart filled with so much fear
When all that you are
Is all I need and more

So tell me
Where do we go from here
Why's my heart filled with so much fear
When all that you are
Is all I need and more

Letting go
More and so much
I know what I'm feeling inside
But part of me still wants to try

So tell me
Where do we go from here
Why's my heart filled with so much fear
When all that you are
Is all I need and more

So tell me
Where do we go from here
Why's my heart filled with so much fear
When all that you are
Is all I need and more

So tell me
Where do we go from here
Why's my heart filled with so much fear
When all that you are
Is all I need and more

So tell me
Where do we go from here
Why's my heart filled with so much fear
When all that you are
Is all I need and more
