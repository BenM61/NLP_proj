I remember April
When the sun was in the sky
And love was burning in your eyes
Nothing in the world could bother me
'cause I was living in a world of ecstasy.
But now you're gone I'm just a daydreamer
I'm walking in the rain
Chasing after rainbows I may never find again
Life is much too beautiful to live it all alone
Oh how much I need someone to call my very own.
Now the summer's over
And I find myself alone
With only memories of you
I was so in love I couldn't see
'cause I was living in a world of make believe.
But now you're gone I'm just a daydreamer
I'm walking in the rain
Chasing after rainbows I may never find again
Life is much too beautiful to live it all alone
Oh how much I need someone to call my very own.
I'm just a daydreamer
I'm walking in the rain
Chasing after rainbows I may never find again
Life is much too beautiful to live it all alone
Oh how much I need someone to call my very own
I'm just a . . .
