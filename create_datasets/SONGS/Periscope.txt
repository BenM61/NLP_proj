I want to feel your wreckage, it's a firestorm
I'm falling like a loaded weapon in your arms
Paranoid it might be reckless, no matter what I say
It's only going to steal your breath and slip away

I don't want to dive in first
You don't want to hear these words
It's only going to make it worse
You don't want to live that curse
You're telling me to keep my hope
Cause you've got a heart of gold
But maybe you should let me go
I'll love you through a periscope

You wear your heart so fearless, it's like it doesn't beat
You push away my demons when they torture me
Don't think that I can fight this pressure pulling me underneath
It's like I've got the whole world tied around my feet

I don't want to dive in first
You don't want to hear these words
It's only going to make it worse
You don't want to live that curse
You're telling me to keep my hope
Because you've got a heart of gold
But maybe you should let me go
I'll love you through a periscope

Oh, oh, through a periscope
Oh, oh, I-I'll love you through a periscope
Oh, oh, through a periscope
Oh, oh, I-I'll love you through a periscope

I don't want to dive in first
You don't want to hear these words
It's only going to make it worse
But you don't want to live that curse
You're telling me to keep my hope
Because you've got a heart of gold
But maybe you should let me go
I'll love you through a periscope

Oh, oh, through a periscope
Oh, oh, I-I'll love you through a periscope
