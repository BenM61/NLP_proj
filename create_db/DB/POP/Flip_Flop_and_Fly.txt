When I get the blues I get me a rockin' chair
When I get the blues I get me a rockin' chair
If the blues ever take me gonna rock right away from here

Now when I get lonesome I get on the telephone
Now when I get lonesome I get on the telephone
I call my baby and tell him I'm on my way back home

Now flip, flop and fly
I don't care if I die
Flip, flop and fly
I don't care if I die
Don't ever leave me don't ever say good-bye

Here comes my baby flashing a new gold tooth
Here comes my baby flashing a new gold tooth
He's so skinny he can mambo in a payphone booth

Give me on last kiss and hold it a long, long time
Give me on last kiss and hold it a long, long time
'Til the feeling over comes me with a feelin' in my head like wine

Now flip, flop and fly
I don't care if I die
Flip, flop and fly
I don't care if I die
Don't ever leave me don't ever say good-bye
