If you're going abroad I can't help you
If you're crossing the street I might be there
If you're going abroad I can't help you
If you're crossing the street I might be there

If you're going abroad I can't help you
If you're crossing the street I might be there
If you're going abroad I can't help you
If you're crossing the street I might be there

If you give it a minute, it's wrong
If you give it a minute, it's gone
If we're just waiting a second too long
Darling, I'll leave and you won't come along

So give me the reason to stay
Give me the reason to wait
You know I don't look to get caught
Cause darling, we're here but my true love is not

Breaking it up before it's on
Breaking it up, it's already gone
Breaking it up, I didn't mean to fraud
Breaking it up

I might be there
If you're going abroad I can't help you
If you're crossing the street I might be there
If you're going abroad I can't help you
If you're crossing the street I might be there

And I call you baby, I will and I do
Persuade you in though I know that we're through
I let you think that I'm yours when I'm not
Keep you here though I'm ready to drop the last line here

Breaking it up before it's on
Breaking it up, it's already gone
Breaking it up, I didn't mean to fraud
Breaking it up

I might be there
If you're going abroad I can't help you
If you're crossing the street I might be there
If you're going abroad I can't help you
If you're crossing the street I might be there

If you're going abroad I can't help you
If you're crossing the street I might be there
If you're going abroad I can't help you
If you're crossing the street I might be there

Breaking it up
Breaking it up
Breaking it up

I might be there
If you're going abroad I can't help you
If you're crossing the street I might be there
If you're going abroad I can't help you
If you're crossing the street I might be there

If you're going abroad I can't help you
If you're crossing the street I might be there
If you're going abroad I can't help you
If you're crossing the street I might be there
