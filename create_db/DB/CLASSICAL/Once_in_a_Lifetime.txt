I still feel the pain the darkness of yesterday
The clouds that held no rain
Illusions remain and memories mock the truth
But God can break these chains
This day comes but once I live or I lose remember

No matter where we've been
No matter what we've done
Today can be our once in a lifetime
For yesterday is gone
Tomorrow may not come
This moment is our once in a lifetime

In spite of the tears the chill of a winter's light
The sorrow of the night
My cold lonely past is melting away from me
As by God's grace I see this moment is mine
My moment of truth forever

No matter where we've been
No matter what we've done
Today can be our once in a lifetime
For yesterday is gone
Tomorrow may not come
This moment is our once in a lifetime

Our day is today our moment is now
To follow out dreams to reach for eternity

No matter where we've been
No matter what we've done
Today can be our once in a lifetime
For yesterday is gone
Tomorrow may not come
This moment is our once in a lifetime
