Joshua fit de battle of Jericho,
Jericho, Jericho.
Joshua fit de battle of Jericho
And the walls come tumblin' down.

Good Morning Sister Mary,
Good morning Brother Joe.
Gonna tell you 'bout old Joshua
And the battle of Jericho.

You can talk about your king of Gideon.
You can brag about your man of Saul,
But there's none like good old Joshua
For to make those old walls fall.

They tell me that the spear of Joshua
Was well nigh twelve foot long
And upon his hip was the doubvle-edged sword
And the man was gospel born.

Up to the walls of Jericho
He marched with spear in hand.
"Go blow dem ram's horns loud and clear
"For the battle am in my hand."

Then the ram-sheep's horns began to blow,
So loudly did they sound.
Then all God's children shouted out
And the walls come a-tumblin' down.
