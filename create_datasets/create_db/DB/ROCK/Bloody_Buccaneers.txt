Hey-la hey-la hey-lo
I scratch the morning with a diamond
Bucked the storm like a whore last night
I'm goin' after that Spanish gallion
Skull, bones and dangerous
I got a tattoo big, always saved my life
A burnin' heart with a stabbin' knife
We swear by the bread and the wine
More serious than any divine
Hey-la hey-la hey-lo
Mexican silver, shining gold
Jewels, pearls and rhum in the hold
I'm the alligator-law chewin' on your bait
Ransackin loodin' you from stern to gate
Last night I saw you against the moon
My beautiful princess white as snow
Nothing wrong about leaning on a shoulder
When you're outta breath
Ho ho let me escort you
And take you to my cabin down below
Ah, you bring the devil out in me
Ah you make me sinn baby sinn baby
Again and again
Oh yeah bloody Buccaneer
The crew's plottin' sharp for the prize
So I lock the door and leave a note outside
Any man break into this room
Better prepare for death and doom
I had my cutlasss on her neck
Warm and white I told her
I'm a pirate from the Skeleton Isles
And I never forget the sweet things she said
Ah, you bring the devil out in me
Ah you make me sinn baby sinn baby
Again and again
Oh yeah bloody Buccaneer
Mexican silver, Peruvian gold
