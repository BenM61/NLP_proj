I teach you a lesson
I know something beautiful
Let me gratify your passion
I call this fashion

You'll enjoy the labour
There is no need to regret
Will you grant the ultimate favour?
There is no failure...

We fly... unto the end of time... Tonight...
We try to get high one more time... Tonight...
We fly... unto the end of time... Tonight...
Don't cry... this love won't be denied... Tonight...
Tonight!

Overcome resistance
There is something beautiful
We can summon into existence
We kill the distance...

Something you cannot measure
Can we ever get enough?
No we never pall with pleasure
We hold a treasure...

We fly... until the end of time... Tonight...
We try to get high one more time... Tonight...
We fly... until the end of time... Tonight...
Don't cry... the stuff won't be denied... Tonight...
Tonight!
