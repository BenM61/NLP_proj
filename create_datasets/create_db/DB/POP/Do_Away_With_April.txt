Couldn't they do away with April
Leave no space, so there's no trace of April
Couldn't they take March
And make it twice as long

'Cause when April finds me
April will just remind me
Of a love that went wrong
(Dunno why it just went wrong)

All this playin' and songs that sing of April
Love is gone, so why go on with April
Wouldn't Paris be just as nice in May, sing
Couldn't they take April and throw it away

Couldn't they take March
And make it twice as long
(Twice as long)

'Cause when April finds me
April will just remind me
Of a love that went wrong
(Dunno why it just went wrong)

All this playin' and songs that sing of April
Love is gone, so why go on with April
Wouldn't Paris be just as nice in May, sing
Couldn't they take April and throw it away

(Couldn't they, couldn't they)
(Couldn't they, couldn't they)
Far, far, far, far away
(Couldn't they, couldn't they)

Take April, take April
(For your love)
And throw it far, far, far away
(Couldn't they, couldn't they)
(Couldn't they, couldn't they)
