Somebody loves me, I wonder who
I wonder who he can be
Somebody loves me, I wish I knew
Who can he be worries me

For every boy who passes me, I shout 'Hey, maybe'
You were meant to be my loving baby, baby, oh
Somebody loves me, I wonder who
Maybe it's you

For every boy who passes me, I shout 'Hey, maybe'
You were meant to be my loving baby, baby

Somebody loves me, I wonder who
Maybe, it's
Baby, it's
Maybe, baby, that somebody is you
