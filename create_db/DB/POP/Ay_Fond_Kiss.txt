Ay fond kiss, and then we sever;
Ay farewell, alas for ever!
Deep in heart-wrung tears I'll pledge thee,
Warrin' sighs and groans I'll wage thee.

Who shall say that fortune grieves him,
While the star of hope she leaves him:
Me, nae cheerful twinkle lights me;
Dark despair around benights me.

Fare thee well, thou first and fairest!
Fare thee well, my best and dearest!
Thine be like, joy and treasure,
Peace, enjoyment, love and pleasure!

Had we never lov'd so kindly,
Had we never lov'd so blindly!
Nor never met  nor never parted,
We would never be so broken-hearted.

Ay fond kiss, and then we sever!
Ay farewell, alas, for ever!
Deep in heart-wrung tears I'll pledge thee,
Warrin' sighs and groans I'll wage thee.
