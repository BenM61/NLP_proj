Heaven knows I love you 
Heaven knows how much I care
Couldn't live without you
Look for me and I'll be there
 
But even though you're a joy to me
I think you think, "he's a bore to me"
What's your thing, am I still your guy? 
I'm so confused, my darling, I could die
 
You're the one on my mind 
Got me working over time
I only think about love and you
Talk to me, don't be shy
Heaven knows I really try to love you
I try to love you
 
Used to be amazing
Used to make the world say "wow"
Heaven brought us together,
That's how I know it'll all work out
 
We built our love on solid ground
And can't a thing ever bring us down
Back together like we wanted to
Forget me not 'cause I remember you

You're still the one on my mind
Love is working overtime
I only dream about love and you
Talk to me, don't be shy
Heaven knows I really try to love you
I try to love you, babe
 
This is love that you can't ignore
I never knew a girl like you before
And heaven knows I couldn't love you more
 
(This is so right, this is so right)
(This is so right) because I love you
I really love you, baby
Back together like we wanted to 
Forget me not 'cause I remember you
 
You're the one on my mind
Got me working over time
I only think about love, don't you?
Talk to me, don't be shy
Heaven knows I really try to love you
I try to love you
 
You're the one on my mind 
Love is working over time 
I only think about love, babe and you? 
Talk to me, don't be shy
Heaven knows I really try to love you
I try to love you, baby
