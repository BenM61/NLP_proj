Shawty put her head on my Snickers'
I told her "shawty ain't no caramel in it"
I can be two pieces just like Reeses
No Halloween but I gotta keep some Maryjane with me
Not taking a nigga hard candy boy
I knock bitches out with my Jolly Rancher
You say you need some space, I'mma Kitkat break it
Need lovin', I'm gon' coast it, break it
For this sweet pussy, 'cause I'm nasty
She wants a sugarbaby but I'm not even her sugardaddy
I love candy, but not that much
Shawty ass shape like a gram cracker
Flat butt, stayed in the house 'til I got my cash up
Jacquees! Tell them what it is, we did it again
Girl you know you taste like candy

Girl your body is legit
Mama made you thick
Don't know why you wonder why them other ho's talk shit
I see sex in your eyes
Sex between your thighs
I don't play no games
You're my candy crush all night
Can I put my face in your water
I know it's out of order
He can't do the things that I do
Know the tricks that I knew
Don't know why you acting brand new

She can't get the Snickers from another nigga
She know what I did with the Twix
My ex-girlfriend can't stand her
'Cause a new man hit her with that Jolly Rancher
And I want ya, call me ya Willy Wonka
And I want ya, call me ya Willy Wonka
And I want ya, call me ya Willy Wonka
Yeah I know they after me
I got that Chocolate factory
Come thru, come thru, lil mama come thru
If you know what's good for you
If you know what's good for you
Come thru, come thru, lil shawty come thru
If you know what's good for you
If you know what's good for you

Girl your body is legit
Mama made you thick
Don't know why you wonder why your ex man so sick
She want Pretty Ricky and Plies, every time she rides
Back shots to Jodeci, that's 9 to 5 all night
Don't really know if I love her, but I love when she's going under
Taste like Aquafina baby, '98 Trina
Girl, I want you three back in, I get her to lead her

She can't get the Snickers from another nigga
She know what I did with the Twix
My ex-girlfriend can't stand her
'Cause a new man hit her with that Jolly Rancher
And I want ya, call me ya Willy Wonka (Willy Wonkaa)
And I want ya, call me ya Willy Wonka (Willy Wonkaa)
And I want ya, call me ya Willy Wonka (Willy Wonkaa)
Yeah I know they after me
I got that Chocolate factory
Come thru, come thru, lil mama come thru
If you know what's good for you
If you know what's good for you
Come thru, come thru, lil shawty come thru
If you know what's good for you
If you know what's good for you
