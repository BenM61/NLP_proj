The burning cigarette guarded
Your mouth from me kissing you
With your hands in your pockets declaring
That it's all over and through
The coldness in your eyes says
I should have left long ago

When the blue is gone
When the blue is gone
I'll go to places unknown

The one thing I'll always remember
Is your back I wanted to hold
I know every scare, every birthmark
The only language it spoke
All dressed up in an armoured suit
I know I'll never get through

When the blue is gone 
When the blue is gone
I'll bury the memories and
Kiss them good bye
And give it another try
