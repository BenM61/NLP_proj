Nothing is sacred
So, give me your soul
Nothing is wasted
On someone like you

Somebody killed me
And tore out my heart, my love
Somebody killed me
Because of you

And there's nothing I can do
The media made you
There's nothing I can do
'cause you don't exist
you don't exist

Just images of heaven
that take me to hell
Images of heaven
Of something to sell
Images of heaven
Images of heaven

Something possessed me
An image of you, my love

Video visions
That play on my mind

Nobody blessed me
With power to reach, my love

When you're an illusion
You can still be divine

And nobody believes
In this new religion
Yeah nobody believes
'cause nobody sees
nobody sees

Images of heaven
Take me to hell
Images of heaven
of something to sell
Images of heaven
Images of heaven

Images of heaven
Images of heaven

And there's nothing I can do
The camera made you
There's nothing I can do
'Cause you don't exist
You don't exist

Just images of heaven
that take me to hell
Images of heaven
Of something to sell
Images of heaven
Images of heaven
