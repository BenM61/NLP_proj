Sometimes it burns like, like a fire, yeah
Love has a mind of, a mind of its own
Don't let it stop your, your desire
Baby, don't end up, end up alone

Stop where you are, look to your heart
Don't be afraid, don't throw love away
Don't get burned by your heart

'Cause you're a long, long way from home
You need a man of your own, keepin' you warm
'Cause you're a long, long way from home
You need to hurry back home, let me keep you warm

Sometimes it feels like life's over, yeah
You know when it feels like everything's wrong
Don't let it take you, take you under
Baby, don't end up, end up alone

Stop where you are, look to your heart
Don't be afraid, don't throw love away
Don't get burned by your heart

I know that at times it doesn't seem fair
Those are times when you don't even care
Broken heart, shattered dreams
Without love, tell me what does it mean

Stop it, baby, right where you are
Don't you let it go, go too far
Stop it, stop it, right where you are
You're a long way from home, yeah

You need a man of your own, keepin' you warm
'Cause you're a long, long way from home
You need to hurry back home, let me keep you warm
