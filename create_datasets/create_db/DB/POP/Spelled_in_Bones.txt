Let the music wait
You don't need it anymore
There's nothing more to say

It's not etched in gold
Or set in stone
It's not written in the stars
It's spelled in bones

Let the music play
Doesn't matter anymore
There's nothing more to say

It ain't on the breeze
Or set up with flares
On backwards messages
Up in the air

It's not etched in gold
Or set in stone
It's not written in the stars
It's spelled in bones

It's spelled in bones
