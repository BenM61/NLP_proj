If it weren't for those (laughter guns) you're riding on
You would not exist
If it weren't for the flashlight shining in my face
Maybe I could resist

I think I'm hyper enough as it is
I think I'm hyper enough as it is
I think I'm hyper enough as it is
I think I'm hyper enough

When all our bones and muscles hurt 
What's so funny about that?
When you remember a saying you can't relearn
What's so funny about that?

I think I'm hyper enough as it is
I think I'm hyper enough as it is
I think I'm hyper enough as it is
I think I'm hyper enough

And I know you are never wrong
I know you are never wrong
I was not weak but the drink was strong
I know you are never wrong

I think I'm hyper enough as it is
I think I'm hyper enough as it is
