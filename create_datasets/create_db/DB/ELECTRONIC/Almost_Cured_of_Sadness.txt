When the world goes away
And it leaves us here
And from nowhere it comes back
And we disappear

Like nothing ever happened
And no one ever noticed
'Til we came back as ghosts
With invisible fears

We're almost cured of sadness
We're almost cured
We're almost cured of sadness
We're almost cured

When the world's almost here
And it won't go away
When you're dying for some peace
From another day

And you just can't stop complaining
About everything you feel
Like a stupid little ghost
That wouldn't disappear

We're almost cured of sadness
We're almost cured
We're almost cured of sadness
We're almost cured

We're almost cured of sadness
We're almost cured
We're almost cured of sadness
We're almost cured
