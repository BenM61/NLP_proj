Feel me, 
Make it all come true, 
Times change, 
Between me and you. 

Bring it all together, 
Break it all down, 
Nothing's quite forever, 
Sometimes upside down... 

It's me and you, (me and you) 
Revolutionary true, 
Colors will fade 
From night to day 
To something new. 

It's me and you, (me and you) 
Revolutionary true, 
Colors will fade 
From night to day 
To something new. 

Taste me, 
Stick your head in clouds, 
Make love, 
Let it all come out. 

Bring it all together, 
Break it all down, 
Nothing's quite forever, 
Sometimes upside down... 

It's me and you, (me and you) 
Revolutionary true, 
Colors will fade 
From night to day 
To something new. 

It's me and you, (me and you) 
Revolutionary true, 
Colors will fade 
From night to day 
To something new.
