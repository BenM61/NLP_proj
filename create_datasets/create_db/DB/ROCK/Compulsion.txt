All the love you stole
All the love you saw
Exposing you but I am torn

Dark spell, I crave you so
I wanna live but you just won't let me go

We laid up there, in stars
Woke up in the storm
Am I yours? I'm unsure

And dark spell, you cast me so
I wanna live but you just won't leave me alone
Oh, I'm

And the wheel keeps turning
But I can't get enough
And the flame keeps burning
But I surrender love, oh yeah

They say the eyes are like
A window to the soul
I ain't so sure, I see through yours

And my borders are broken wrong
I just can't protect and protect them no more

Yeah, and the wheel keeps turning
But I can't get enough
And the flame keeps burning
But I surrender love, oh yeah

Turn your back on another world
Promise yourself never again

Oh yeah, love
And the wheel keeps turning
But I can't get enough
And the sun keeps burning
And I surrender love
