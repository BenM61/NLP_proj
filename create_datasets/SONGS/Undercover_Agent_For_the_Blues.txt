She was my lover
She was working undercover
Oh the woman knew all of the moves
She really had me rompin'
We were barefoot stompin'
She just kept igniting my fuse

I was blinded by the blackness
Of her long silk stockings
She was rocking with an optical illusion
This ain't how I'd thought it'd be
She just kept on keeping me
In a total state of confusion

She took me for a ride
Rattled me down to my shoes
And I found out
She was an undercover agent for the blues

She never really needed love
Omnidirectional
I was just an innocent bystander
She kept on getting kinkier
I sank hook, line, and sinker
Just, just, just too hot to handle

She took me by storm
It must of been a season for the fools
She's so bad
An undercover agent for the blues
