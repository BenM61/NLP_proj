When you're young and so in love as we
And bewildered by the world we see
Why do people get a soul
Ony those in love would know
What a town without pity can do

If we stop to gaze upon a star
People talk about how "bad" we are
Ours is not an easy age
We're like tigers in a cage
What a town without pity can do

The young have problems
Many problems
We need an understanding heart
Why don't they help us
Try to help us
Before this plain granted planet falls apart

Take these eager lips and hold me fast
I'm afraid this kind of joy can't last
How can we keep love alive
How can anything survive
When these little minds tear you in two
What a town without pity can do

How can we keep love alive
How can anything survive
When these little minds tear you in two
What a town without a pity can do
No it isn't very pretty 
What a town without pity can do
