I need your love so badly
I love you oh so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you
I thought at last I found you

But other loves surround you
And I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you
If you'd surrender
Just for a tender

Kiss or two
You might discover
That I'm the lover
Meant for you

And I'd be true
But what's the good of scheming
I'm dreaming
For I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you

'Cause I don't stand
A ghost of a chance
With you
