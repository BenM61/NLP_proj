We did a song f*ck da police you know 
and everybody been hearing f*ck sayin' 
f*ck da police for years and years and years
and finally it took a muthaphukka to video tape
a nigga gettin' the shit beat out of him
for everybody else to say f*ck da police
and we did f*ck da police people put us down
and sayed we were ahead of our time you know it
took the video you know ya shot by accident
to tell the truth and open the worlds eyes
yes we do have a serious problem in L.A.
and other citys true retaliate happens all the time
people tryin' to change things for years but I don't
think anything is gonna help the problem is to deep
N.W.A. is just being brutally honest.
