Hey looky here see me grin ear to ear all aglow I'm so bamboozled
(Bamboozled)
Hey look at me walking tall as a tree since I got a lot bamboozled
(Bamboozled)
I kept shying away she kept sighing away
Now suffice it to say that I fought but I'm finally caught
I fly like the birds feel too lovely for words yesiree that's me bamboozled
Out of my whisps but the thrill of it fits like a glove
(Bamboozled bamboozled by you)
Heaven open the door I ain't running no more
I got bamboozled but oh how I love it in love
(la la la la la la la la la bamboozled)
(la la la la la la la la la bamboozled)
I tried taking a stand
She kept taking my hand
That felt wonderful grand
So I fell like a ton I'm a son-of-a-gun
Will you look at me now not a crease on my brow
When we kiss I'm this bamboozled
Sailing right along feeling bright as the song of a dove
She kept playing it smart
Kissed me out of my heart
I got bamboozled (bamboozled bamboozled) (both) but how I love it in love
