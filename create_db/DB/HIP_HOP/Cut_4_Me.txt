So many nights
She's got me high
Someone who won't bite
Don't wanna stop her
I gave it time, I'm in no rush
You're slippin' now, that's right
Can't wait to tear it apart

Cum 4 me
You're all that i need
Tenderly
Give me what i need
Would you please rock
Carefully
You're all that i need
Talk to me
Give me what i need
Would you please breakdown

Stop thinking twice
You say it's wrong
But it feels so right
Now you can't handle
A kiss from behind
I make you blush
You're slippin' now, don't fight
Can't wait to tear that apart

Cum 4 me
You're all that i need
Tenderly
Give me what i need
Would you please rock
Carefully
You're all that need
Talk to me
Give me what i need
Would you please bite hard

Bite, bite, bite, bite hard
Break, break, break, break down
