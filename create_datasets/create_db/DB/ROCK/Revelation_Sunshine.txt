Did you see was I obvious
Could you tell I did try to hide it
We can't have can we try just to share
I did try to take it

When I look I see you in me
I don't want to fight it
Shelter us from the storm
It's so warm I get lost inside it

Out of my mind
Into yours
Out of my mind
Into yours

Take it slow we got time to find it
We don't have to chase it
Got no push got no shove
We just got love we don't have to force it

Out of my mind
Into yours
Out of my mind
Into yours

We got change it's changing all the time
You got yours and I got mine
Promise me that you won't promise me
Revelation sunshine because I'm

Out of my mind
Into yours
Out of my mind
Into yours

Love
Love is
Love is all
Love is all around
Love is all around us
Love is all around us look
Love is all around us look around
