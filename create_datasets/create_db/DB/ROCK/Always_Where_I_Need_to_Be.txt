She don't know who she is
I can take her anywhere
Do whatever comes naturally to you
You know she just don't care
You know she just don't care

'Cause I'm always where I need to be
Yeah, and I always thought I would end up
With you, eventually
Do dodo do do do do
Do dodo do do do do
Do dodo do do

Now I see her again
I ask to be her hummingbird
Whisper words in her ear
Oh now you know I just don't care

'Cause I'm always where I
Where I need to be
And I always thought
I would end up with you eventually
Do dodo do do do do
Do dodo do do do do
Do dodo do do

I'm a man, I'm a man I'm a man on the scene
I'm a man, and I can be so obscene
Because I always think that I know how to be
But I always thought that I would end up with you, eventually
Do dodo do do do do
Do dodo do do do do
Do dodo do do
I'm a man, I'm a man I'm a man on the scene
I'm a man, and I can be so obscene
