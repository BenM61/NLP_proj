Chorus:

If you're not flipping cuts like DJ Romes
Well then you're not representing with the LP
If you're not dropping tracks like Madlib
Well then you're not representing with the LP
Well if you're not kicking styles like Wild Child
When then you're not representing with the LP
But if you're not supporting hardcore hip hop
Well then you're not a real hip hop MC

[Wild Child]
If you're not in tune to this total bliss
Now a days a lot of rappers I like to diss
'cause yo, all up in your songs you be talkin' bout your glocks (what?)
But then you change 'cause you can't be the same around the clock
You be actin' like a Amazon when the camera's on
But when the camera's off, you be actin' soft
'cause you be in that mental state, thinking that ya great
But everywhere around the gates people saying that ya fake
Like dropping out of weight while you're trying to have your cake
But ya jams ain't got no weight and many niggas won't debate
(Hey, how we do?) we keep it hot like Benihana (word)
With no drama, while you try to bite like a piranha
I'll make you wanna...

[Madlib]
...bounce, bounce when you come to see the Pack
I'mma carbonate ya flow 'cause yo' style be sounding flat
Jack A.K.A. constructor of a rhyme on a track
Conducted by Madlib invade ya face like blah
Bring it back as I rock it slow, with my lip socket lyrics,
scratch as I rock a show with simultaneous functions we create
'cause we're the sure shot
The flow got you all hypnotized but if you're not...

(Chorus)

[Wild Child]
Yo, Wild Child straight rearranging on ya drums
Ya niggas from the slums step up ya want to hum
As I take ya ass way back when blacks was like chilling
(To late for that now) Why? (Brothers mad killing)
Yo, I live in hip hop day to day because I feel it
Can't understand wack MC's out there, they try and kill it
I'll steal it, take it home, package it and seal it
Bring it out on a daily basis and fry it on a skillet
Question: Will it, will it last forever?
Can't compare it to the past...never!
We're used to touch the mics, uplifting MC's on the rise
Come with the abstract and then straight up vocalize

[Madlib]
Most people now a days talk about representing
They strictly smoking Philly's, acting ill, getting bent and
The ways of the industry's mad shady tinted (yeah)
Most niggas tripping off the ill joints we invented (right)
Whether you're in L.A., Texas or Trenton
Alaska, Nebraska, Japan you have ta
Know the difference from a fake MC to a real MC
Before you play that Loot Pack CD

(Chorus)
