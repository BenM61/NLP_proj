Back in ten minutes
And I'll just hang the sign
I've got to find a place
To clear my mind

I'm the flyer
With only one desire
I'm the flyer
Nobody's gonna shoot me down

I've got an urgent appointment
And I can't be late
I've got a million things
That I have to wait
Just hang on a minute
I'll try to hurry back
I hate to make you wait
But I'm going and I'm going fast

I'm the flyer
With only one desire
I'm the flyer
Nobody's gonna shoot me down

I fly and never look back
I fly away before they shoot me down
I fly

Back in ten minutes
And I'll just hang the sign
I've got to find a place
To clear my mind

I'm the flyer
With only one desire
I'm the flyer
Nobody's gonna shoot me down

I fly and never look back
I fly away before they shoot me down
I fly I'll hang the sign and find a place to clear my mind
I fly and never look back
I fly away before they shoot me down
I fly
I Hate to make you wait

I'm the flyer
With only one desire
I'm the flyer
Nobody's gonna shoot me down

I'm the flyer
With only one desire
I'm the flyer
Nobody's gonna shoot me down

I'm the flyer
