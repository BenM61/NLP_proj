I Love the Life I Live
I see you watching me just like a hawk
I don't mind the way you talk
But if you touch me something's got to give
I live the life I love
And I love the life I live

A diamond ring and my money too
Tomorrow night they could belong to you
The girls move me at their will
I live the life I love
And I love the life I live

May lay a hundred-dollar bet this time
Tomorrow night I can't cover your dime
Next week I could be over the hill
Just trying to tell you people how I feel

I see you rocking and you pass me by
Talk about me 'cause I might be high
Just forgive me if you will
I live the life I love
And I love the life I live

May lay a hundred-dollar bet this time
Tomorrow night I can't cover your dime
Next week I could be over the hill
Just trying to tell you people how I feel

I see you rocking and you pass me by
Talk about me 'cause I might be high
Just forgive me if you will
I live the life I love
And I love the life I live

Live the life I love
I love the life I live
I live the life I love
The life I live
