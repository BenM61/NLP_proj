Baby (woo!)
Can you hear my call (woo!)
I'm beginning to fall (woo hoo!)
In love with you

Baby (woo!)
It must be true (woo!)
The way my heart beat (woo hoo!)
When I see you

You got me where you want me (woo!)
And that's where I want to be (woo!)
You got me reeling and rocking
(Like a ship upon the sea)

Baby (woo!)
Can you hear my call (woo!)
I'm beginning to fall (woo hoo!)
In love with 

Baby (woo!)
It must be true (woo!)
The way my heart beat (woo hoo!)
When I see you

When I see you...
When I see you...
