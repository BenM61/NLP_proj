Had science gone too far

Hark, listen here
I've been locked in this laboratory fifteen years
I had a thirst and desire
Till you came along and it all backfired

It held the key to understand
All of the secrets stored in man
Now it will ravage all in its path

As it grows, as it grows, as it grows
And grows and grows and grows

Science gone too far, science gone too far
How did you ever break the jar?
Science gone too far, science gone too far
Maybe it hasn't crawled too far

Don't let it die
Its molecular structure is one of a kind
It's a world gone haywire
Radiation only added the fuel to the fire

Now there's a creature on the loose
Mammoth proportions it has induced
Innocent people have to die

As it grows, as it grows, as it grows
And grows and grows and grows

Science gone too far, science gone too far
How did you ever break the jar?
Science gone too far, science gone too far
Maybe it hasn't crawled too far

As it grows, as it grows, as it grows
And grows and grows and grows

Science gone too far, science gone too far
How did you ever break the jar?
Science gone too far, science gone too far
Maybe it hasn't crawled too far

Science gone too far, science gone too far
Science gone too far, science gone too far
Science gone too far, science gone too far
Science gone too far, shake it down
