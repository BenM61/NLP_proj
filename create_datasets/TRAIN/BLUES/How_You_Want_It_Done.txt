Why don't you tell me, lovin' mama 
How you want you're rollin' done
Why don't you tell me, lovin' mama 
How you want you're rollin' done
Lord, I give you satisfaction
Now, if it's all night long

Lord, I got up this morning
Just about the break of day
Lord, I got up this morning
Just about the break of day
Lord, I'm thinkin' 'bout my baby 
Lord, the one that went away

I got me a little brownskin 
Just as sweet as she can be
I got me a little brownskin 
Just as sweet as she can be
Lord, she low and she squatty
But she's alright with me

Now you can put me in the alley 
My gal's name is Sally
You wake me up in the mornin' 
Mama, I still got that old habit
Why don't you tell me
How you want it done
Now, I give you satisfaction 
Now if it's all night long

Lord, some of these old mornings 
Mama, Lord, it won't be long
Lord, some of these old mornings 
Mama, Lord, it won't be long
Lord, I know you gonna call me
Mama, Lord, and I'll be there
