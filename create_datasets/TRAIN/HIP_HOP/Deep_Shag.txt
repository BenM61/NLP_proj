i feel small when i am 
next to you
i feel big when i 
forget you
i feel small when i am 
next to you
i feel big when i 
forget you
why do you make me feel so 
why do you make me feel so
why do you make me feel so
why do you make me
feel so small
 
i'm draggin in your deep shag
what i become, what i become
i'm in your deep shag
stuck in rags
what i become, what i become

believe me i am teething
when my eyes are full
of feeling
i forget my personality
my hell raising days
they seem so sweet
and i'm always telling you
lies to hide the truth inside
the fetus i become
the minute i succumb
to your embrace

i'm draggin in your deep shag
what i become, what i become
i'm in your deep shag
stuck in rags
what i become, what i become
what i become, what i become
what i become, what i become

believe me i am teething 
when my eyes are full
of feeling
i forget my personality
my hell raising days
they seem so sweet
and i'm always telling you
lies to hid the truth inside
the fetus i become
the minute i succumb
to your embrace
i succumb to your embrace 
i succumb to your embrace
i succumb to your embrace
i succumb to your embrace

draggin in your deep shag
what i become, what i become
i'm in your deep shag
stuck in rags
what i become, what i become

believe me i am teething
(what i become)
when my eyes are full
(what i)
of feeling
(become)
i forget my personality
(what i become)
my hell raising days 
(what)
they seem so sweet
(i become)
and i'm always telling you
lies to hide the truth inside
the foetus i become
the minute i succumb
to your embrace
i succumb to your embrace 
i succumb to your embrace
i succumb to your embrace
i succumb to your embrace
