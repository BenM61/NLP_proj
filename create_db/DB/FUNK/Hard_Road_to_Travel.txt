I've got a hard road to travel 
And a rough rough way to go
Said it's a hard road to travel 
And a rough rough way to go
But I can't turn back, my heart is fixed
My mind's made up, I'll never stop
My faith will see, see me through

Let me tell you
I'm all alone, this lonesome road I roam
I've got no love to call my very own
Oh, the river gets deeper 
The hills get steeper
And the pain gets deeper every day, yeah

I've got a hard road to travel 
And a rough rough way to go
Said it's a hard road to travel 
And a rough rough way to go
But I can't turn back, my heart is fixed
My mind's made up, I'll never stop
My faith will see, see me through

Aah, aah, one more thing

I dream of a home far beyond the sea
Where there is love and peace and joy for me
Oh, in my eyes I see troubles and dangers for me
But destiny where it leads me I must go, hey

I've got a hard road to travel 
And a rough rough way to go
Said it's a hard road to travel 
And a rough rough way to go
But I can't turn back, my heart is fixed
My mind's made up, I'll never stop
My faith will see, see me through

Aah, no, help me somebody
Aah, somebody please, help me right now
