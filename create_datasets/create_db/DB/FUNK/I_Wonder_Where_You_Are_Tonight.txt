I've sailed over the ocean, and I've traveled many lands
Even flown in the big bird in the sky looking down from heaven's den
And as I go from town to town drifting like the wind
Loneliness is my company and hope is my friend

And I wonder where you are tonight

They said you wanted to be a star and see the big city lights
So you jumped in the car with your guitar, promised you're always right
I hear your songs on the radio, your big publicity
And all that we had, boy, is drifting in the wind

And I wonder where you are tonight

Wish I never said goodbye
I just can't stand these lonely, lonely nights
Sometimes I break down and I cry
I'm just drifting in the wind, looking for a friend

Sailed over the ocean and I've traveled many, many lands
No matter how far I try to slip away, my heart just won't let me win
All those memory of you and me just linger in my mind
And I, I just can't forget you, boy, and this feeling we left behind

And I wonder where you are tonight

Baby, baby, I wonder where you are tonight
I wonder where you are tonight
Sometimes I break down and cry
I wish you'd never said goodbye
How I wonder, ooh I wonder
