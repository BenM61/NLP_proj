The best of everything, that's (that is) what I wish you all
The best of everything, a Rembrandt (hanging) on your (the) wall
A yacht that wins you cups, skateboards with style and speed
Show dogs or loving pups, the pride of the pound or the pedigreed
I hope you win that prize, pass that blue ribbon test
I hope your good keeps getting better, til your better's best
With every wine you taste, with every song you sing
By now you may have guest, I hope you get the best of everything
