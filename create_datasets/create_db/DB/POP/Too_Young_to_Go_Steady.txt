Too young to go steady, too young
I hear him (her) say.
He (she) says I'm (we're) not ready
But then why am I (are we) feeling this way?

Too young so he (she) tells me
He (she) says we'll have to wait.
Why wait till it may be too late?

Can't he (she) realize he (she) drive me wild
Is he (she) made of stone?
Must he (she) always treat me (act just) like a child?

Won't he (she) ever own up
I'm (we're) grown up?
Some day he'll (she'll) be sorry
Some day just wait and see
He'll (she'll) wish he'd (she'd) gone steady with me!
