Messing with my pride, thinking anytime
You could just get up and go
Then I realize what the hell is love
If you're in complete control?

Hey ma, hey ma, hey, hey ma, hey ma
Hey, come to my house and take me home
Sucked a bye away, shot to outer space
Spend it but I'm not alone

Fall into your blue
Fall into your blue
Fighting it is hopeless, sinking in your ocean
Just like you designed me to do
Fall into your blue

Sunrise in your bed, purple, yellow, red
Only when it's you and me
Take me to the edge, right through your lens
Show me what I need to see

Hey ma, hey ma, hey, hey ma, hey ma
Hey, come to my house and take me home
Ever losing lanes, battle ships and planes
Push me out, away we go

Fall into your blue
Fall into your blue
Fighting it is hopeless, sinking in your ocean
Just like you designed me to do
Fall into your blue

Come to my house and take me home
Come to my house and take me home
Come to my house and take me home
Come to my house and take me home
Come to my house and take me home
Come to my house and take me home

Fall into your blue
(Come to my house and take me home)
Fall into your blue
(Come to my house and take me home)
Fighting it is hopeless, sinking in your ocean
Just like you designed me to do
Fall into your blue
