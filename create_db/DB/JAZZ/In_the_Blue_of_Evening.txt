In the blue of evening
When you appear close to me, dear one
There in that dusk we'll share a dream reverie
In the blue of evening
While crickets call and stars are falling
There 'neath the midnight sky you'll come to me

In the shadows of the night  we'll stand 
I'll touch your heart and then
Softly as your lovely eyes entreat 
Our lips will meet again

In the blue of evening
Night winds above whisper "I love you"
Then we will find romance
In the blue of evening
