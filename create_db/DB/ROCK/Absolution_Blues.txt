Bless me, Father, I have sinned, I've broken hearts, got drunk on gin
An' still I lust for sweet young things.
On the day that I was born, bells rang out in Babylon
Still I can't tell right from wrong, no matter what the Good Book says.

Now I can see the sun is shining,
But, I can feel the rain
Falling down to wash my tears away,
Wash my tears away.

Holy Mother, save your tears, you've cried for me a thousand years
But, I was blind to all your fears.
Now I can't stop the tears from falling down.
Come the dawn of judgement day,
I'll get down on my knees and pray,
St. Peter don't you, don't you send me away.

Now I can see the sun is shining,
But, I can feel the rain
Falling down to wash my tears away.

Bless me, Father, I have sinned, I've broken hearts, got drunk on gin
An' still I lust for everything, every little thing
Come the dawn of judgment day, I'll get down on my knees and pray,
The Good Lord don't send me away, I'll never ever go.

Now I can see the sun is shining,
But, I can feel the rain
Falling down to wash my tears away.

Wash my tears away, I'll get down on my knees
Don't send me away, don't you send me away, no, no, no.
