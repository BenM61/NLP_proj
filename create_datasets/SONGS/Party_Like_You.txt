You got me feeling like a Saturday night
You got me buzzing like a Miller Lite sign
No last call inside, hell it's gonna be a wild ride
And you, know what you're doing when you do
That lipstick dance on the cigarette
And that moonlight and moonshine
Hell I just want to cross the line with you
(That's right)

You got me rocking, rolling, like New Orleans
Cut off booze like damn you know it
Little bit a drink, little wink wink
Tell me what you think I've been looking for a party like you
You get dancing, hearts get stolen
I love the way the night is going
Little bit a drink, little wink wink
Tell me what you think
I've been looking for a party like you

All them dudes
Been looking at me wondering what I have to do
To wind up on this bar stool next to you
Shooting "quila" with a hottie
They just over there shooting pool
Oh and I, yeah I'm a damn lucky guy I
I must have done something along the way that's right
Good Lord has blessed me with a hell of an angel tonight

You got me rocking, rolling, like New Orleans
Cut off booze like damn you know it
Little bit a drink, little wink wink
Tell me what you think I've been looking for a party like you
You get dancing, hearts get stolen
Love the way the night is going
Little bit a drink, little wink wink
Tell me what you think
I've been looking for a party like you

Yeah party like you
I said a party like you girl

You got me rocking, rolling, like New Orleans
Cut off booze like damn you know it
You get dancing, and hearts get stolen
I love the way the night is going
Little bit a drink, little wink wink
Tell me what you think
I've been looking for a party like you

Yeah, I said a party like you
Oh I said party like you girl
A party like you
