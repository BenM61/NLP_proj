Hey, I can be the answer
I'm ready to dance when the amp up
And when I hit that dip, get your camera
You could see I been that b*tch since the Pamper
And that I am that young sis, the beacon
The b*tch who wants to compete and
I could freak a 'fit, that pump with the peep and
You know what your b*tch become when her weave in
I just wanna sip that punch with your peeps and
Sit in that lunch if you're treatin'
Kick it with ya b*tch who come from Parisian
She know where I get mine from, end of season
Now she wanna lick my plum in the evening
And fit that ton-tongue d-deep in
I guess that c*** getting eaten
I guess that c*** getting eaten 
I guess that c*** getting eaten 
I guess that c*** getting eaten 
I guess that c*** getting eaten 

I was in the 212
On the uptown A, n*gga you know what's up or don't you?
Word to who made ya
I'm a rude b*tch, n*gga, what are you made up of?

F*ck him like ya do want to cum
You're gay to get discovered in my two-one-deuce
C***-a-licking in the water by the blue bayou
Caught the warm goo in your doo-rag too, son?
N*gga you're a Kool-Aid dude
Plus your b*tch might lick it, wonder who let you come to one-two
With ya doo-doo crew son, f*ck are you into, huh?
N****s better oooh-run-run
You could get shot, homie, if ya do want to
Put ya guns up, tell your crew don't front
I'm a hoodlum n*gga, you know you were too once
B*tch I'm 'bout to blew up too

Who are you, b*tch, new lunch?

I'ma ruin you, c***
I'ma ruin you, c***

Ayo (ayo), I heard you're riding with the same tall, tall tale
Telling them you made some (made some)
Saying you're grinding but you ain't going nowhere
Why you procrastinate girl? (-nate girl)
You got a lot, but you just waste all yourself
They'll forget your name soon (name soon)
And won't nobody be to blame but yourself, yeah

W-when-when I premiere?
B*tch, the end of your lives are near
This sh*t been mine, mine

With the fifth c***ed n*gga, it's the two-one-zoo
F*ck you gon' do, when your goon sprayed up?
Bet his b*tch won't get him, betcha you won't do much
See, even if you do want to bust
Your b*tch'll get you cut and touch you crew up too, Pop
You're playing with your butter like your boo won't chew c***
The gun, too - where you do eat poon, hon?
I'm f*cking with you, cutie-q
What's your d*ck like homie, what are you into, what's the run, dude?
Where do you wake up? Tell your b*tch keep hating,

See, I remember you when you were
The young new face, but you do like to slumber, don't you?
Now your boo up too, hon
I'ma ruin you c***
