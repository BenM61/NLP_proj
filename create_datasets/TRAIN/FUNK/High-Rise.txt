I knew her well
We suffered through the good and the bad times
Believed above else
She was mine
But she said that it couldn't last forever
Runnin' 'cross the bridge she said

No, boy, oh, no
I won't be comin' back again
I've got better things to do
I'm gonna miss you, oh

She wanna live in a high-rise
Way up on the east side
A city, ho...
In high society (Ho, ho)

She wanna live in a high-rise
Way up on the east side
A city
Where she can forget about me, ooh

I remember the moment
She took me through it in the pourin' rain
Said there's somethin' all the love in the world
Ain't gon' change
And as we ran for shelter under the oak tree
She suddenly turned to me and said

No, boy, oh, no
We've pretended long enough
Now the time is almost here
I won't leave no tears (No), no tears

She wanna live in a high-rise
Way up on the east side
A city (Ho, yeah)
In high society (Oh, please don't go) (Ooh)

She wanna live in a high-rise
Way up on the east side
A city, hey
Where she can forget about me, ooh

Said she's got to find a way to get up there (Woo)
Said she hasn't really made it yet to you up there

I won't be comin' back again (Baby)
I've got better things to do (Please)
I'm gonna miss you, miss you, ooh (Oh)

She wanna live in a high-rise
Way up on the east side
A city (city) ho, yeah
High society (Oh, please don't go)

She wanna live in a high-rise
Way up on the east side
A city (city) ho, baby
Where she can forget about me (Oh, oh)

She wanna live in a high-rise
Way up on the east side
