Girl, I got one question
Are you still awake?
Awake enough for me to see you, see you
Please just listen, yes I know it's late
But better late than never

I know it's five in the morning, morning
Not sure who I'm calling, calling
You haven't heard from me in some time
Girl I hope you want me, want me
When you hear me talking, talking
You know I've been out and is it OK I stop by

When I'm drunk in the morning,
I'm calling you, you might be lonely, lonely
When I'm drunk in the morning
I'm calling you, you might lonely, lonely

Emma I dated, and Sophie I kissed, baby
Sarah I had in my hand, but I'm calling you
But not before it's past two o'clock
'Cause I'm balling with my boys, my boys, my boys

I know it's five in the morning, morning
Not sure who I'm calling, calling
You haven't heard from me in some time
Girl I hope you want me, want me
When you hear me talking, talking
You know I've been out and is it OK I stop by

When I'm drunk in the morning
I'm calling you, you might be lonely, lonely
When I'm drunk in the morning
I'm calling you, you might lonely, lonely

I know you're glad I called, now you can have it all
When we are together, you know how it should be
When you're drunk
Maybe we should go (should go) and spend some time alone
Baby you're so beautiful
When I'm drunk, when I'm drunk, yea

When I'm drunk in the morning
I'm calling you, you might be lonely, lonely
When I'm drunk in the morning
I'm calling you, you might lonely, lonely
