I said see, see, see rider
Oh, see what you have done
I said see, see, see rider
Oh, see what you have done
Oh girl, you made me love you
Now, now, now your lovin' man has gone

hear what I say

Well, I'm going away, baby
And I won't be back 'til fall
Well, I'm going away baby
And I won't be back 'til fall
And if I find me a good girl
I won't, I won't be back at all

Hear what I say, I said

See see rider,
Oh see what you have done
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Get me a shotgun
Just as long as I am tall 
What'd I say

Now I'll shoot a-my a-baby 
And then I'll catch that cannonball
