I'm known to have a heart that love couldn't find
I used to come and go no thought of what I left behind
But now somehow I've grown to see the world through brand new eyes
A better world that you've shown to me
When you were gone
Felt like the stars were pointless to shine
And my days dragged on
Without a cause or reason to find babe
I'm on my own
I'm just a lonely waste of time
That should be spent with you faithfully

[Chorus]
So I never wanna live without you
Never gonna live without you
I never wanna live without you
Never wanna live
Cause you're the biggest part of my life
All of my world is built around you

Never make it through without you
All the love you bring to me

I was blind
Such a fool but now I see darling
Just hold my hand
Wherever we are just hold me
And now the second chance to start a life and family
I thank the Lord and you for this gift to me

So I never wanna live without you baby (I'll never live without you babe)
Never gonna live to doubt you (never live to doubt your love)
No I never wanna live without you baby (oh no)
Never wanna live without the biggest part of my life
Wanna build my world around you baby (wanna build my world)
Never make it through without you
All the love you bring to me

Thank you for the love
When you knew I was wrong
Thank you for the chance
To run back to your arms
Where I belong
I don't need to see
Who is there on the other side
Cause you are my love
My life
Until the day I die

[Chorus]
