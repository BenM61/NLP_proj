Day dreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
Day dreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
Day dreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
Day dreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
Look at my heart floating away

He's the kind of guy that would say
"Hey baby let's get away, let's go some place, huh"
Well, I don't care
He's the kind of guy that you give your everything
And trust your heart, share all of your love, 'til death do you part

I wanna be what he wants when he wants it
And whenever he needs it
And when he's lonesome and feelin' love starved
I'll be there to feed it
I'm lovin' him a little bit for each day
He turns me right on when I hear him say

(Hey, baby, let's get away, let's go somewhere far)
(Baby, can we?)
Well, I don't care
(Hey, baby, let's get away, let's go somewhere far)
(Baby, can we?)
Well, I don't care

I wanna be what he wants when he wants it
And whenever he needs it
Lovin' him a little bit more each day
It turns me right on when I hear him say

(Hey, baby, let's get away, let's go somewhere far)
(Baby, can we?)
Well, I don't care
(Hey, baby, let's get away, let's go somewhere far)
(Baby, can we?)
Well, I don't care

(Day dreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you)
(Day dreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you)
(Day dreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you)
(Day dreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you)
(Look at my heart, floating away)

(Day dreaming) thinking of you
(Day dreaming)
Thinking of you

Day dreaming
Day dreaming
