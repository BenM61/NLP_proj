I take the cue from 
Certain people I know 
I use the cue 
And then I 
Hand it on to you 

And when I swing it 
So, it catches his eye... 
(weren't you there ? 
- you'd have died !) 

I trust the views of 
Certain people I know 
They look at danger 
And they 
Laugh their heads off 

Their clothes are imitation 
George the 23rd 
(don't you find this absurd?) 

I'd hate to be like 
Certain people I know 
They break their necks 
And can't afford to
Get them fixed 

Ah, they'd sacrifice all 
Of their principles for 
Anything cashable 
I do believe it's terrible 

Oh, wo, wo 
Ah, ah, ah, ah 
Oh, wo, wo 
Ah, ah, ah, ah 
Oh, wo, wo 
Ah, ah, ah, ah
