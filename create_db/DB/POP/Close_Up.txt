Let me get a close up
Let me get a close up
Look to the right
Look to the right
Let me get a close up
Let me get a close up
You ready?

Don't follow patronymic
Sploogie-hugie, look at that spillage
Scoop it up for the clinic
Try to keep it up in your lineage
Making me live it, got no limits
Cinic, cinic, cinic, wait, wait a minute

Who were you looking at when you grew fat
You just blew that, can't re-do that, that

Diminish the pillage
A privilege to visit my village
Are you finished? Soft shrinkage
You see no coins in my pitch

Look to the right
Look to the right
Let me get a close up
Let me get a close up
Get on your knees
Roll on over
Let me get a close up
Let me get a close up
You ready?

Hormone zone, different wardrobe, testosterone
Blendr, Tinder, Findr, Grindr, romance the phone
Better go home, better get stoned
Set up in the mirror for a peek of the clone
You're a person alone with a person alone
Touch the [?], gonna break your head bone

Just a lot of scrimmage
Not real, but image
A vintage gimmick
That you just can't mimic

Look to the right
Look to the right
Let me get a close up
Let me get a close up
Get on your knees
Roll on over
Let me get a close up
Let me get a close up
You ready?

Look, look
Looking real close and you showin' it around like you know me now
Look, look
Pumpin' up the land, sea and homes and bends, you don't know me now
Look, look
Close up to the skin, but I never let you in, I'm a secret cow
Look, look
Put away the gear, come on, come on over here, let me show you how

Blink at me
Blink at me good
Blink at me, blink at me, blink at me
Blink at me good

Look to the right
Look to the right
Let me get a close up
Let me get a close up
Get on your knees
Roll on over
Let me get a close up
Let me get a close up
