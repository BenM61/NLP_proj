Here I am baby, the one who swore to never yield
Here I am baby, the one who swore to play the field
Said I wouldn't let no man tie me down, not a single one now
Wasn't gonna give my heart to a mother's son now
Many a day I proudly stated, the man for me ain't been created

But here I am baby, the one who was so love-defiant
Here I am baby, the one who was so self-reliant
Said I wouldn't need men or nothin' else; I'd be independent
Make a fortune all my own, I'd know how to spend it
I'd be so stationary, love would be unnecessary
But here I am

Here I am, baby baby baby, you want me and I do concede
Here I am, baby baby baby, I find you're what I really need
Say you've got me hangin' on a string, don't you let me drop now
Since you started lovin' me, don't you ever stop now
Don't wanna be loved by another, I ain't goin' another further

Here I am, baby baby baby, take me 'cause I'm yours alone
Here I am, baby baby baby, yours to call your very own
