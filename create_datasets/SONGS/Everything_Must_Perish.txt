Through the smoke I see the trees
No one left for us to please
A perfect world where no one dies
Go to heaven with your lies

Wasted and confused
I walk around with my shortened fuse
A fire burns inside my head
Is this living or am I dead?

In my dreams I see the end
A perfect circle never bends
As time and hope erode our fears
I close my eyes for one last tear

Tomorrow may never come
Mountains clash in the sun
The freezing snow starts to melt
A quiet moment to myself
Reflecting somewhere on the past
I hope this feeling will always last
In paradise we stand alone
Forgotten king without a throne
A bird takes flight, now out of sight
The sun catches its shadow

Come alive

Above in the air, there is no despair
We are waiting for the moment

A darkened shadow hides my face
I hope I won't forget this place
This burning sky that we call home
In the end we stand alone

Tomorrow may never come
Mountains clash in the sun
The freezing snow starts to melt
A quiet moment to myself
Reflecting somewhere on the past
I hope this feeling will always last
In paradise we stand alone
Forgotten king without a throne
A bird takes flight, now out of sight
The sun catches its shadow

Above in the air, there is no despair
We are waiting for the moment
