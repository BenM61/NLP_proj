Confidential as a church at twilight (confidential)
Sentimental as a rose in the moonlight (I love you)
My love for you will always be (confidential)
Confidential to me (ooh ooh ooh ooh)

Confidential as a mother's prayer (confidential)
Too beautiful for other hearts to share (it's a secret)
My love for you will always be (confidential)
Confidential to me

[Chorus]
Our love's our precious secret
A beautiful thing apart
There's no need for prying eyes
To look into my heart

Confidential as a baby's cry (confidential)
Sacred and holy as a lover's sigh (I love you)
My love for you will always be (confidential)
Confidential to me

Confidential as a baby's cry
Sacred and holy as a lover's sigh (I love you)
My love for you will always be (confidential)
Confidential to me (ooh ooh ooh ooh)
