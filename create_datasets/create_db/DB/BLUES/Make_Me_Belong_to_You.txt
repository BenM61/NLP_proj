Darlin' I am
Whatever you make me
So baby baby whatever you make me
Make me belong to you
I can't be your beggar or king
You've got the power
To make me anything
You've got the power 
So open your heart it's up to you
It's up to you
Cause darlin' I am
Whatever you make me
So baby baby whatever you make me
Make me belong to you

I can't be your puppet on a string
You've got the power
To make me anything
You've got the power
So open your heart it's up to you
It's up to you
Cause darlin' I am
Whatever you make me
So baby baby whatever you make me
Make me belong to you
