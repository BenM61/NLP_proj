If I said that we could fly
Around the world two thousand times
If I said that baby your smile
Had taken me by surprise 

If I had changed my mind, would I be here

You groan to passing guests
Your car has run out of gas
If I said you're working to hard
Would you be there in my mind 

If I had changed my mind, would I be here 

Would I be, could I be, here, come on 

If I had changed my mind, would I be here 

would I be here
