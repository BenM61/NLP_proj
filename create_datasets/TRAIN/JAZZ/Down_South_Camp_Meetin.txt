Yeah--hear that preacher spread the word 
Cause it's the greatest word
You've ever heard
When he says
"I'm callin' sinners right now you hear
I'm callin' sinners right to me
When ol' Satan grabs your soul 
It takes the Lord's true word to break his hold
So I say you got to listen mostly to me
You got to listen closely"
Don't let the devil catch y' nappin'
Gotta keep the vigil every minute
Or the devil gonna surely git you
"Watch your step 'n' how you act
Mister Scratch is here, an' that's a fact
If anyone can stop him, I can
That's why I'm the preacher man"
We hear the word 
We hear your voice
We know there really isn't any other choice 
Head f' heaven t' day

We can show you the way
Relieve all strain
Leave your cares and your woes

Heaven knows

Y' dodge that devil in his fine fancy clothes yes!
Come git aboard
We still got space
Hear the word of the Lord
We saved your place
Save your soul while y' can
Yes!

Git on as fast as you can
You've heard the sermon sublime
Down south camp meetin' time!
