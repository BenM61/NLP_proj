I hate to tell you this, but I'm very, very happy
And I know that's not what you'd expect from me at all
I'm not the kind to smile and bow out gracefully
I always wanted to take it to the wall

But I found somebody with a heart as big as Texas
I found an angel with the golden wings
She saw me down here in the dark somehow
And everything is different now

Yeah, I miss the old crowd sometimes
And the wild, wild nights of running
You know, a starving soul can't live like that for long
You go around in circles that just keep getting smaller

You wake up one morning and half your life is gone
I got so tired of that; I got so lonely
I dropped down and I called out to heaven
Send me someone to love.
And heaven shot back, you get the love that you allow.
And everything is different now

Oh, and it's sweet to know
The wisdom that living brings
Since I got a telegram from the god of simple things

She said, I don't care what you do for a living.
She said, I don't care what kind of car you drive.
All I want to know right now is what do you believe in
And what it means to you to be alive

Will you stand here in this fire with me?
Are you ready for another life?
So I bit that bullet, I took that vow
And everything is different now
Everything is different now
Everything is different now
Everything is different now
Everything is different now
Everything is different now
Everything is different now
Everything is different now
Everything is different now
