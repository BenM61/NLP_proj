There's a body in the bay
The cops are taking it away
They said this case was closed
It only shows you that never know

So who they gonna get
When the troubles got to stop
Here's my card
I'm the Continental Op

Jane Doe in the bay
Now that's exhibit 'A'
Bloodstains on the dress of the millionairess
But I saw you leavin' town
I'm gonna have to track you down

Just like a hound
You slipped through the web
And you might have dodged the Feds
But who they gonna get when you've outfoxed the cops

Here's my number
I'm the Continental Op
Call the agency, we never close
First consultation is free
Check my reputation, check my pose

But first check my fee
There's a menace on the streets
Offering infants sweets
Don't give this man a ride
Lock your car from the inside

He's suspect No. 1
But I guess his race is run
He left a set of prints
He's not as smart as he thinks

'Cause who they gonna get
When the trouble's gotta stop
Here's my card
I'm the Continental Op

There's a body in the bay
The cops have taken it away
They say this case was closed
It only shows that you never know

Bruises 'round the neck
When they did a body check
I saw you leaving town
I'll track you down like a hound
Who they gonna get when you've outfoxed the cop

Here's my card
I'm the Continental Op
Yeah, who they gonna get
When you've out foxed they cops

Here's my badge
I'm the Continental Op
