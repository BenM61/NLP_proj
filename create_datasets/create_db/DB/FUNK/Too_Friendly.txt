Hey love, watcha say to your crew
Can you come and let me see what you gonna do
Can I do the thing what I do to you
But I let 'em know that isn't cool
(Hey, love) Hey love, you got 'em all outta pocket
You make me want to think about pluggin' up the socket
You won't believe all the things they say
Especially when you're gone away

Baby, they keep on tellin' me that
They want me to come over and hit it from the back
Betcha didn't know that your girl was like that
Straight up do your man right behind your back
They keep on playin' me close
Talk about when I plan on letting you go 
You need to your girlfriends that's for sure
Let 'em know, let 'em know I ain't jokin' around

Hey Baby, you must be tellin' your friends
About me
'Cause they keep tryin' to get at me
Just a little bit
Too friendly

Hey love, they're comin' at me crazy
Your best friend told me that she want to have my baby
But I let her know now, that's okay
'Cause you're the only one for me 
(Hey, love) Hey love, tell me what you said
She keeps tryin' to do me 
Like she want me real bad
Trying so hard to get in my bed
I guess she wants to nod her head

They keep on tellin' me that they
Want me to come over a hit it from the back
Betcha didn't know your girl was like that 
Straight up do your man right behind your back
They keep on playin' me close 
Talk about when I plannin' on letting you go
You need to check your girlfriends
That's for sure
Let 'em know I ain't jokin' around

Hey Baby, you must be tellin' your friends
About me
'Cause they keep tryin' to get at me
Just a little bit
Too friendly

Hey Baby, you must be tellin' your friends
About me
'Cause they keep tryin' to get at me
Just a little bit
Too friendly

Hey Baby, you must be tellin' your friends
About me
'Cause they keep tryin' to get at me
Just a little bit
Too friendly

Why your girlfriends always comin' around me
