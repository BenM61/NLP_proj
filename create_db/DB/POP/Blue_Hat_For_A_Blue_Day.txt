Did you say it's all over, it was me not a whisper,
the marriage is over, was it me or my heart,
justify all affection, beyond recollection,
I was fine in virginia, guess it's true what I said,
wake up, get up, get out, break up
just say goodbye for today,
I'm wearing my blue hat for a blue day is all we need
please my love, release the things that I touch
please my girl, release the story of love,
swim with love, don't lose that magical part of you,
my sweet blue girl,
you're heading to lose your blue hat for a blue day
is all we need
a blue hat for a blue day is all we need,
but you can't understand what I hold in my hand,
it's only...god, how I miss you,
my blue times that rain so hard
but you can't understand what I hold in my hand,
it's only...god, how I miss you,
my blue times that came so hard, blue for you,
blue for you, did you say it's all over
leaving for minnesota, the marriage is over,
was it me or my heart, please my love,
don't lose the story of love,
blue hat for a blue day is all we need,
a blue hat for a blue day, a blue hat for a blue day,
blue day, blue day, a blue day, it's all over,
I guess it's all over for us two,
but you can't understand my blue day.
