Summer don't know me no more
Eager man, that's all

Summer don't know me
He just let me love in my sea
'Cause I do know, Lord
From you that
Just died, yeah

I saw that day
Lost my mind
Lord, I'll find
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine

Don't stop the buck when it comes
It's the dawn, you'll see

Money won't get there
Ten years passed tonight
You'll flee

If you do that
I'll be some
To find you

I saw that day
Lost my mind
Lord, I'll find
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine

I saw that day
Lost my mind
Lord, I'll find
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine
