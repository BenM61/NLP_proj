You built me up with your wishing hell 
I didn't have to sell you 
You threw your money in the pissing well 
You do just what they tell you 
REPENT  that's what I'm talking about 
I shed the skin to feed the fake 
REPENT  that's what I'm talking about 
Whose mistake am I anyway? 
Cut the head off 
Grows back hard 
I am the hydra 
Now you'll see your star 
Prick your finger it is done 
The moon has now eclipsed the sun 
The angel has spread its wings 
The time has come for bitter things (chorus) 
The time has come it is quite clear 
Our antichrist 
Is almost here
It is done
