Careless, I am reckless
I'm a wrong way traveling, slowly unraveling, shell of a man
Burn out, I'm so numb now
That the fire's just an ember way down in the corner, of my cold, cold heart

Lord this time, I'll make it right
Here at the altar I lay my life
You're kingdom come and my will was done
My heart is broken as I cry

Like so many times before
I flood my eyes
I try before I leave the floor
Oh Lord I try(I'll try)
But this time Jesus how can I be sure
I would not lose my follow through
Between the altar and the door

Here at the altar
Oh my world so black and white
How could I ever falter
What you've show me to be right

Lord this time (Lord this time)
I'll make it right (make it right)
Here at the altar I lay my life
You're kingdom come, but my will was done
My heart is broken as I cry

Like so many times before
I flood my eyes
I try before I leave the floor
Oh Lord I try(I'll try)
But this time Jesus how can I be sure
I would not lose my follow through
Between the altar and the door

I'm trying so hard, to stop trying so hard
Just let you be who you are
Lord who You are in me

Jesus I'm trying so hard
To stop trying so hard
Just let you be who you are
Lord who You are in me, Oh Lord I

Like so many times before
I flood my eyes
I try before I leave the floor
Oh Lord I try(I'll try)
But this time Jesus how can I be sure
I would not lose my follow through
Between the altar and the door

Like so many times before
I flood my eyes
I try before I leave the floor
Oh Lord I try(I'll try)
But this time Jesus how can I be sure
I would not lose my follow through
Between the altar and the door

Try (trying so hard)
Like so many times before (try so hard)
