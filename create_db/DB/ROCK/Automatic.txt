Hush all that noise! what can I do for you sister?
We plugged into the universe
And spiral out of orbit.
Like a rudderless ship, whatever you want to
Call it

Are you afraid? what comes next? any idea?
You say the action is go, I say it's out of
Control
While they are playing songs of love

Standing on shaky ground
Walking on thin ice
Never use a safety net
You never get trapped

This is automatic
Got no doubt about it
My mind is over matter
Can't get any better
And we know this is magic
We've got the perfect habit
We're stealing it from different planets
And we put it on a boombox

Two people from the world of entertainment
Get down on their knees and beg me to stay
Take them back, take it back, take me back
Are we heading to the bar for the hopeless
Emptiness is taking over a rudderless ship?
Sounds like a goodie
You can't leave? 
Can't stay? 
Cold feet?

Standing on shaky ground
Walking on thin ice
Never use a safety net
You never get rapped

This is automatic
Got no doubt about it
My mind is over matter
Can't get any better
And we know this is magic
We've got the perfect habit
We're stealing it from different planets
And we put it on a boombox
Got no doubt about it
My mind is over matter
We've got the perfect habit
We're stealin it from different planets
And we put it on a boombox

Five chances of not making it
We learn until we earn the shit

Sky high
You play your favorite note
I sing my favorite line
No better place to go
No better place to shine
Sky high
