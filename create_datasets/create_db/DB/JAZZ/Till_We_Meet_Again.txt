Smile the while you kiss me sad adieu
When the clouds roll by, I'll come to you
Then the skies will seem more blue
Down in lovers lane, my dearie

Wedding bells will ring so merrily
Every tear will be a memory
So wait and pray each night for me
Till we meet again

So wait and pray each night for me
Till we meet again

Till we meet again
Down in lover's lane
Wait and pray each night for me
