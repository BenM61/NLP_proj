So fine
The melody is taking over your mind
Words cannot describe the way you feel inside
Yeah babe I wrote this song for you you, you you

Damn right
This story is for you you to make you feel right
Just to bring a little happiness in your life
'Cause that is all I wanna do, do, do, do

Just read every line it's the story of your life
Just read every line it's the story of your life
(Story of your life, story of your life)

This song's for you
(This song's for you)
(This song's for you)
(This song's for you)
(This song's for you)
(You, you, you)

So fine
The melody is taking over your mind
Words cannot describe the way you feel inside
Yeah babe I wrote this song for you you, you you

Damn right
This story is for you you to make you feel right
Just to bring a little happiness in your life
'Cause that is all I wanna do, do, do, do

Just read every line it's the story of your life
Just read every line it's the story of your life

This song's for you
(This song's for you)

Ho ho
Ho ho
