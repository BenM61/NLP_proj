F*** the four walls that you're stuck with, f*** it
Yeah we got different opinions well f*** it
The last chance for a dance
To bring it down and lay it low
The talk the talk, talk of the last days coming
I don't believe a f***in' word of it, nothing.
For your kind. For your king
Right now you should know

That they're taking all the colours away
Can't put it back together again
They're taking all the colours away
We will never forgive
And we will never forget

Chop the tree down and replace it with nothing
They kill ideas at the push of a button
Pull your strings, do your thing
You're just a puppet right?

Fire...

And they're taking all the colours away
Can't put it back together again
They're taking all the colours away
We will never forgive
And we will never forget

Let go! [x2]
Fire... [x3]

And they're taking all the colours away
Can't put it back together again
They're taking all the colours away
We'll stay this way forever yeah

They're taking all the colours away
We will never forgive
And we will never forget

F*** the four walls that you're stuck with, f*** it
Yeah we got different opinions well f*** it
The last chance for a dance
To bring it down and lay it low
