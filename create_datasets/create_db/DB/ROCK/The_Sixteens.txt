Where were you in sixty-eight
In sixty-eight Julie was Johnnie's date
Two kids growin' together
Livin' each day as if time was slippin' away
Oh, they were just sixteen
And their love a teenage dream
They passed the time, they crossed the line
The line that ran between
Julie and Johnnie now you've made it

But life goes on, you know it ain't easy
You've just gotta be strong
If you're one of the sixteens
And life goes on, you know, you know it ain't easy
You know you'll never go wrong
'Cause you're all part of the sixteens

Suzie and Davey got to make the big time
Maybe they can put it all together
In a show that lasts forever
Oh they would walk the strip at nights
And dream they saw their name in lights
On Desolation boulevard
They'll light the faded light
Suzie and Davey you can make it

But life goes on, you know it ain't easy
You've just gotta be strong
If you're one of the sixteens
And life goes on, you know, you know it ain't easy
You know you'll never go wrong
'Cause you're all part of the sixteens

So where were you in sixty-eight
When Bobby and Billy thought
That sixty eight was out of date
They took the flowers from their hair
And tried to make us all aware
Too bad, too late
So they lived from day to day
And tried to do it all their way
But sixty-eight was sixty-eight
No matter what they say
Bobby and Billy maybe you'll make it one day...
