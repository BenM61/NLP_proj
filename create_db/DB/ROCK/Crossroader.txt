I'm a crossroader.
Speedin' from town to town.
I'm a crossroader.
Speedin' from town to town.
I never ride the main highway.
So nobody can slow me down.

I'm always trav'lin'.
Just a taste outside the law.
I'm always trav'lin'.
Just a taste outside the law.
If you come lookin' for some trouble
I'm the man that you'relookin' for.

When things ain't movin' fast enough
I gotta' pick up and move
When things ain't movin' fast enough
I gotta' pick up and move
They say it ain't no way for a man to be livin'.
It's the crossroader's blues.
