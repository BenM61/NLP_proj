Say, I've got the Heebies
I mean the Jeebies
Talking about
The dance, the Heebie Jeebies
Do, because they're boys
Because it pleases me to be joy

Say, don't you know it?
You don't know how; don't be blue
Someone will teach you
Come on and do that dance
They call the Heebie Jeebies dance
Yes, ma'am
Papa's got the Heebie Jeebies dance

Say, come on now and do that dance
They call the Heebie Jeebies dance
Sweet mama
Papa's got to do the Heebie Jeebies dance

Woo, got the Heebie Jeebies
Whatcha doin' with the Heebies?
I just have to have the Heebies
