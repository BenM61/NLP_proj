Well I never thought I'd make it
Here in Hollywood
I never thought I'd ever
Want to stay
What I seem to touch these days
Has turned to gold
What I seem to want
Well you know I'll find a way

For me it's the only life
That I've ever known
And love is only one
Fine star away
Even though the living
Is sometimes laced with lies
It's alright
The feeling remains
Even after the glitter fades

The loneliness of a one night stand
Is hard to take
We all chase something
And maybe this is a dream
The timeless face of a rock and roll
Woman while her heart breaks
Oh you know the dream keeps coming
Even when you forget to feel

For me it's the only life
That I've ever known
And love is only one fine star away
Even though the living
Is sometimes laced with lies
It's alright
The feeling remains
Even after the glitter fades

For me it's the only life
That I've ever known
And love is only one fine star away
Even though the living
Is sometimes laced with lies
It's alright
The feeling remains
Even after the glitter fades
Oh you know the feeling remains
Even after the glitter fades
Oh the feeling remains
Even after the glitter
