I see your breath hanging there
Like snow clouds
Like snow clouds
Across the valley
The snow falls down
Onto my skin

In my heart, you'll stay
In my heart, with me
In my heart, you'll stay
In my heart, in my heart.

I miss you when the
Air is still
And I can hardly feel
But with one breath
You are here

You are here
(In my heart, you'll stay)
You are here, with me
In my heart, you'll stay
In my heart, in my heart

Out of all the breath in me
I keep yours in my heart
Out of all the breath in me
I keep yours in my heart

Now you will always be with me
In my heart
Now you will always be with me
