Kick it around
Tell me if you'll be mine
Kick it around in your own good time
Don't tell me now
I know I'm on trial
So kick it around for a while

Will I be your true lover
Or take you for a ride
One way or the other
Whatever you decide

You heard my proposition
Now baby take your time
Tell me your decision
When you made up your mind

Kick it around for a while
