Too many heartaches have been rejected 
A notified delay 
I feel adrenalin ejecting 
And I'll soon go on my way 
And it's so hard now 
And it's so hard now 
Beating on my brain 
I find no fascination to stimulate 
I'll do it all again 

Oh you find love inside an automatic gun 

Another lifestyle breaks on the carpet 
Nothing as before 
Without old intuition 
We're feeling stronger 
We're communists at war 
And it's so hard now 
And it's so hard now 
Authority denied 
We pull the trigger 
The cartridge empty 
But marxists still reply 

Oh you find love inside an automatic gun 

I throw my fist in your chest 
In search of a refugee 
Love is bust from an air assault cannon 
?
Heaven in your hands 
Go beating on my brains 
Go beating on my brains 
Go 

With new abandon 
We're resurrected 
Throwing you apart 
With acclamation 
Company deposited 
Pissing on your heart 

Oh you find love inside an automatic gun
