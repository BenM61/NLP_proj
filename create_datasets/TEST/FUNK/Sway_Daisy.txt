I been calling, I been calling to the other side
I been waiting for an answer, thought I dialled up the number right
I lay back and watch silhouettes dancing on the wall
Pull me in, I'm kissing, shadows motion, stretch, I'm feeling tall

I'm searching, searching, tryna find the words
Busy looking for the books buried underneath the earth
Everytime I hear 'em say my name, I don't see no one there
Calling, I'm calling, how you disappear?

Maybe I'll know someday, someday
Long as I see fire in the night sky
Shining on me, shining on all of us
No matter where we're looking up

Maybe I'll know someday, someday
Long as I see fire in the night sky
Shining on me, shining on all of us
No matter where we're looking up

I try, I try
I keep turning pages, faded, broken paper, dry my eye
Every time I hear 'em say my name, I don't see no one
All of these illusions, make 'em real so I can go on

Maybe I'll know someday, someday
Long as I see fire in the night sky
Shining on me, shining on all of us
No matter where we're looking up

Maybe I'll know someday, someday
Long as I see fire in the night sky
Shining on me, shining on all of us
No matter where we're looking up

Maybe I'll know someday, someday
Long as I see fire in the night sky
Shining on me, shining on all of us
No matter where we're looking up
