Can I help it that I fell in love with you
Can I help it that you broke my heart in two
How can I control the tears that ache to fall
When I know that I'll never matter to you at all

I recall how you once were the springtime to me
Though I knew, somehow, this love could never be
Still I'm clinging to a dream that won't come true
Can I help it if I'm still in love with you

Still I'm clinging to a dream that won't come true
Can I help it if I fell in love with you
