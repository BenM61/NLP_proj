I'm on parole, I used to be on probation
I'm with my gun, I get full coporation
I tell you "Take it off" no hesitation
Nigga you play around, I lay you down, that's how it's going down
Don't play with me, I don't have patience
My head aching, and I need my medication
Niggas be hating, they don't know what they facing
Nigga you play around, I lay you down, that's how it's going down
I be in court throwing signs like I'm a mason
Nigga witness against me, I'mma erase 'em
If they try an runaway, I'mma chase 'em
Now with the pound, and I'mma lay 'em down, that's how it's going down

Better watch how you talk, better watch where you walk
On the streets of New York, that's how we get down
22's on the jeep, something deep in the seat
When we creep with the heat, that's how we get down

Wise men listen and laugh while fools talk
Stick up kids don't live long in New York
F*ck around and catch the wrong jukes on the street
Get caught slipping, then get hit with like three
In every hood in the US, I'm that nigga they feeling
Rap full of good guys, 50 Cent is the villain
I play the bar with eight bottles all night getting right
Teaching the hoodrats what Cristal taste like
I put 60 on wrist, 12 on my fist, 100 on my neck
We in the hood nigga scheming, what you expect?
My S on 22's leave ya hoes confused
On the track ready to choose, like "Daddy, we want you"
My love live ain't change, the shorties still hug me
Bullet wound in my face, and bitches still love me
Now Nelly told you how them country boys talk
I came to teach you how we put it down in New York, that's how we get down

Better watch how you talk, better watch where you walk
On the streets of New York, that's how we get down
22's on the jeep, something deep in the seat
When we creep with the heat, that's how we get down

In the city, a young buck'll tell you how the mac spit
O.G. give 'em the word, you gonna get your ass hit
I don't know why niggas like to talk bad about me
I'm the richest nigga they know without a G.E.D
Man it could be the money, it could be the ice
It could be they'd like to be me and can't live my life
You should hear they be saying man "50 be flipping"
"Shot my man over seven grams, that nigga be tripping"
I know death is promised, I don't fear getting murked
It's when a nigga half-way killa ya homie, it hurts
Now we can hit the club and get it crunked
Or you could start some shit, and I could hit you with the pump
You can have it how you want, but I know you like my style
Uh-huh, you like how I break it down
Wanna get rich? I'll show you how
Take this pack, pump these pieces, that's how we get down

Better watch how you talk, better watch where you walk
On the streets of New York, that's how we get down
22's on the jeep, something deep in the seat
When we creep with the heat, that's how we get down
