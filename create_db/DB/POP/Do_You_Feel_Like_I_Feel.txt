I don't know how you do what you do
I'm so shaken by you baby
I can barely breath
Every time I see you
I just want to break down and cry
No one's ever moved me
Just the way you move me inside

Do you feel like I feel
Or am I all alone
Is this love really real

Baby I've got to know

When you held me last night
Were your words really real
Are you just using me
Or do you feel like I feel
Do you feel like I feel

From that moment that I met you baby
I just knew
It was so easy for me just to be with you
When the sun comes shining
Will you still be lying by my side
Tell me if I'm dreaming
Is there deeper meaning
For me in your life

Do you feel like I feel
Or am I all alone
Is this love really real

Baby I've got to know

When you held me last night
Were your words really real
Are you just using me
Or do you feel like I feel
Do you feel like I feel

I'm the one who wants you
I'm the one who needs you
I'm the one who won't let go
You've got all the power
I'm dying by the hour
Come on baby let me know

When you held me last night were your words really real
God I'm so much in love
Do you feel like I feel, like I feel, like I feel
