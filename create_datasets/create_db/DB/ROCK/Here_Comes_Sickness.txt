Heh

Here comes sickness
Walking down my street
Shaking her hips
Like she's some kinda treat
All the neighborhood dogs
Licking at her feet
Here comes sickness
Here comes sickness
Here comes sickness
Walking down my street
Yeah

Here comes sickness
Moving up my block
When she comes to my house
I hope she don't knock
All the neighborhood dogs
Sniffing at her crotch
Here comes sickness
Here comes sickness
Here comes sickness
Moving up my block
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah

There goes sickness
In my daddy's car
Good riddance to the both of you
I hope you go far
All the neighborhood dogs
Should be drunk in the bar
There goes sickness
There goes sickness
There goes sickness
In my daddy's car
