Dear life, I wish you have told me
'Bout the beautiful ways
I'm not the best at falling
Most of the time
The best times hide in mistakes
Sometimes I wish I was blind
To see the others' beauty
To see the others' beauty
To see the others' beauty
To see the others' beauty
To see the others' beauty
To see the others' beauty
To see the others' beauty

To see the others' beauty
(To see them all)
To see the others' beauty
(To see them all)
To see the others' beauty
(To see them all)
To see the others' beauty
(To see them all)
