Walk out
I am feeling pretty
Have fun
Summer in the city
For once just enjoy the ride

Walk out
I am feeling pretty
Have fun
Summer in the city
Any rime I can find a riddle
Any season I can find a reason
For once just enjoy the ride

All the eyes
I can find inviting
All the boys
I can find attractive
You look fine
There's nothing to worry
Take your time
'Cause baby there's no hurry
For once just enjoy the ride
For once just enjoy the ride

I'll pretend
I don't know you're looking,
I'll invent
Everything we shouldn't say.
But baby, hush
'Cause all the city is sleeping
And baby, rush
This is time we're stealing
For once just enjoy the ride
For once enjoy the ride

Look down, my skirt is short
High heels gonna make you laugh
I'm gonna make you want me
Gonna laugh, gonna dance
I'm gonna enjoy the ride
The ride, the ride
