Falling like leaves
Give me a chance to recover
Deep in you eyes
Half of me lies
Let me be more than a lover
Let me be more than a lover

Oh, let it be known
You're my heart, your my home
You're the world that I wanna discover
All I can give is the way that I live
And I wanna be more than a lover
Oh, let me be more than a lover

Lovers are like
Stars in the night
Never quite touching each other
Deep in your eyes
Half of me lies
Let me be more than a lover
Let me be more than a lover

Oh, let it be known
You're my heart, your my home
You're the world that I wanna discover
All I can give is the way that I live
And I wanna be more than a lover
Oh, let me be more than a lover

Oh, let it be known
You're my heart, your my home
You're the world that I wanna discover
All I can give is the way that I live
And I wanna be more than a lover
Oh, let me be more than a lover

Let me be more than a lover
