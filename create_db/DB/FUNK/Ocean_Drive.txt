Say it's true, black and blue, I can share your situation 
Been holding our emotions back, will only make us cry 
If you go, I know, but you know, it ain't so serious anyway 
When the clouds arise we'll live on

Ocean Drive 
Don't know why you're so blue 
Sun's gonna shine on everything you do 
And the sky is so blue 
Sun's gonna shine on everything you do 

He left you Black and blue, without a word of explanation 
And he took your love for granted and he left you high and dry 
You know someday, when you'll wonder what you see in him anyway
What that days arrives we'll live on

Ocean Drive 
Don't know why you're so blue 
Sun's gonna shine on everything you do 
And the sky is so blue 
Sun's gonna shine on everything you do
