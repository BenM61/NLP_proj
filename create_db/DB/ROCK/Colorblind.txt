Breathe in
Run fingers over scarred skin
Let the guilt rain down all over me
Try to justify my hypocrisy
And breathe out
Watch the words as they fall from your mouth
They sound pretty sharp, and they probably sting
About how I've been distant lately
It's quiet now and you're waiting on me
Could you repeat yourself? I wasn't listening

Save yourself, I'm not worth the time
This failure is built deep into my design
Is there something wrong with me?
This doubt is deafening
'Cause you were gold but I'm color blind

Find a reason
Is it the change of season?
Maybe it's just a color I can't see
Or maybe it's not meant for me
Is it all of the above?
See, that's the funny thing about love
It's never been a friend to me
Just an artificial enemy
I've known it's face, but only watched it leave

Save yourself, I'm not worth the time
This failure is built deep into my design
Is there something wrong with me?
This doubt is deafening
'Cause you were gold but I'm color blind

And this complacency just seems to get the best of me
As I wander aimlessly back to everything I left behind
A new face, a different story, the same mess of me
And I never learn my lesson 'cause I'm blind

Save yourself, I'm not worth the time
This failure is built deep into my design
Is there something wrong with me?
This doubt is deafening
'Cause you were gold but I'm color blind
