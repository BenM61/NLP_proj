Take time, show me, love me
You know what I want you to know
Take time, show me, love me

You, the thought of you brings happiness to me
I can't deny it no more, you mean more than the world to me
In every word that you say, in every thing that you do
I want you to know my heart belongs to you

No need to play along
It's not like we don't know what's going on
There's one thing that I want you to do for me, daddy

Take time, show me how much you love me, oh
Take time, show me how much you love me

You, what I see in you, you're so good to me
I just can't fight it no more, telling me that you'll always be
For every time you pass my way
Something inside that makes me sing
I want you to know my heart belongs to you

No need to play along
It's not like we don't know what's going on
There's one thing that I want you to do for me

Take time, show me, how much you love me
I want to just take time, show me, how much you love me

I'll take the time to show how much I care
My dear, come here, don't blush, let me kiss you on your ear
You've been so good from the start
I think it's about time that I gave you my heart
So here, take it, well baby please don't break it
And I will do for you, and anything for us to make it
You know you are the one, the one I want to wait for
In fact baby, here's the key to my front door

Take time, show me, love me
You got me singing
Take time, show me, love me

You, for every time you pass my way
Something inside that makes me sing
I want you to know my heart belongs to you
B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B, ooh!
