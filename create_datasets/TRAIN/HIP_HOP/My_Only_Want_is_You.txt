It seems only yesterday I let you
We fell in love and made our vow
We said that we would always be together
Until the sun would cease to shine

And how was I to know that love wasn't easy?
I never seemed to matter then, oh oh oh
A victim of my own selfish feelings
I just only want is you (I want you) 
I just want is you, I just want is you baby

The feelings that we share with each other
So innocently we played the part
For in all of might there were no questions
And distantly I placed a heart

On and on we go, never stopping
To deal with what was on our mind, oh oh oh
We are victims of our own selfish feelings
Still my only want is you
My only want is you, just you, baby

So what does one do when love's in question?
I can't believe when you let it fall apart
I can't believe when you let it go, baby
Why don't you let it slip away?

And how was I to know that love was not easy?
I never seemed to matter then, And never seemed to matter.
And I'm a victim of my own selfish feelings
Oh, and my only want is you

My only want is you, baby
My only want is you, you're the only one I want
My only want is you, all alone right from the start
(Don't you know that really?  Don't you know?)
Doin' it over and over again, baby
You were the only one (Don't you know?)
I can say 'yeah' to you baby
Sayin' now, sayin' now, sayin' it right now
My only want is you, my only need is you baby
Well could you just not understand it?
Could you just believe me baby when I touch you?
I'm gonna let it go right now
