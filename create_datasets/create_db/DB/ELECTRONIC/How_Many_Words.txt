I...I...I... I'm, I'm Through
I...I...I... I'm, I'm Through
I...I...I... I'm, I'm Through
I'm through with you...

I...I...I... I'm, I'm Through
I...I...I... I'm, I'm Through
I...I...I... I'm, I'm Through
I'm through with you...

Right back where we started
Falling apart at the seams
You've tagged your name on my heart
And I sat there and let it bleed

Sweetheart so now this is goodbye

I'm letting you go
You're letting me down
Been caught in your reign and I almost drowned
I'm letting you go, our love's black and blue
How many words does it take
To say I'm through?

I...I...I... I'm, I'm Through
I...I...I... I'm, I'm Through
I...I...I... I'm, I'm Through
I'm through with you...

You said you knew what romance is
Jaded I fell for your lies
But you're out of second chances
Sadly were fading out tonight

Sweetheart so now this is goodbye

I'm letting you go
You're letting me down
Been caught in your reign and I almost drowned
I'm letting you go, our love's black and blue
How many words does it take
To say I'm through?

I have to
Don't want to
I've got to set you free
No more words
It's over
Now I can finally breathe

I'm letting you go
You're letting me down
Been caught in your reign and I almost drowned
I'm letting you go, our love's black and blue
How many words does it take
To say I'm through?

I'm letting you go (I have to)
You're letting me down (don't want to)
Been caught in your reign and I almost drowned (I've got to set you free)
I'm letting you go, our love's black and blue (no more words)
How many words does it take (It's over)
To say I'm through? (now I can finally breathe)

I...I...I... I'm, I'm Through
I...I...I... I'm, I'm Through
I...I...I... I'm, I'm Through
I'm through with you...

I...I...I... I'm, I'm Through
I...I...I... I'm, I'm Through
I...I...I... I'm, I'm Through
I'm through with you
