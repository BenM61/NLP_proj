Ooh what you do to me (yeah yeah)
Quietly your silhouette approaches me
A vision far too lovely to define (hey yeah)
Tenderly you take complete control of me
The feminine seduction of body, soul and mind (yeah)

Touch me and I feel your femininity
Girl you're the lady women want to be
Softly you move when you're making love to me
Love me every night with femininity

A child of innocence is how you look at me
But it's the woman's touch that makes it feel so right (so right)
Your lips consume my deepest sensitivity
It feels so good it makes me want to cry (makes me cry)

Oh, oh, oh
Femininity
Oh, Femininity

Let me feel myself inside you once again
I love the way you say it's just for me
A lady in the purest sense of elegance
But when the lights go down girl you're making love, strong, wild and free

I like the way you take control of me
You have a little certain quality
Not many girls would ever dare to be
The lady that you are femininity
