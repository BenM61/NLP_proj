Everything I have is yours
You are part of me
Everything I have is yours
My destiny

I would gladly give the sun to you
If the sun were only mine
I would gladly give this earth to you
And the stars that shine
Everything that I possess
I offer you

Let my dream of happiness
Come true
I'd be happy just to spend my life
Waiting at your beck and call
Everything I have is yours
My life
My all

Everything I have is yours
You are part of me
Everything I have is yours
My destiny

I would gladly give the sun to you
If the sun were only mine
I would gladly give the earth to you
And the stars that shine
Everything that I possess
I offer to you

Let my dream of happiness
Come through
I'd be happy just to spend my life
Waiting at your beck and call
Everything I have is yours
My life
My all
