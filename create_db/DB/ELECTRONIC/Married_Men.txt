The world is full of married men
With wives who never understand
They're looking for someone to share
The excitement of a love affair
Just as soon as they find you
They wine you and dine you
You fly on the wings of romance
But in the eyes of the world
You're just another crazy girl
Who loves a married man
Oh your love is a secret
And you've got to keep it
As long as you can
No don't cry for your lover
There's always another married man
The world is full of married men
Oh yeah you make him feel so young
But his wife will still be number one
He promises to marry you
Just as soon as his divorce
Comes through
And it's not just a fling
He swears it's the real thing
A love that could last till the end
As he's driving away
You know it's true what they say
About married men
They do it, they do it, they do it
They do it again and again
They do it, they do it, they do it
They do it, married men
Oh he'll run when the scandal
Gets too hot to handle
He'll say I just want to be friends
They he'll walk out of your life
He'll go home to his wife
'Cause he's a married man
Oh your love is a secret
And you've got to keep it
As long as you can
No don't cry for your lover
There's always another married man
The world is full of married men
They do it, they do it, they do it
They do it again and again
They do it, they do it, they do it
They do it, married men
He'll walk out of your life
And go home to his wife
A married man
Don't cry for your lover
There's always another married man
They do it, they do it, they do it
They do it again and again
They do it, they do it, they do it
They do it, married men....repeat and fade
