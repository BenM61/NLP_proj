Making like a Romeo, making on a Juliet (she said) 
Maybe you're a Montague, maybe you're a Capulet 
Maybe you don't trust me yet, let me light your cigarette 
Be you shark, be you jet, never forget that 

Love conquers all (L-O-V-E love) 
Love conquers all (L-O-V-E love) 
When Bogart saw Bacall 
He knew that love conquers all (L-O-V-E love) 
(Woah) It's only love, yeah 
Love conquers all 

Making life a monument, making love a strategy (she said) 
Baby you're so confident, why the hell you asking me 
Savages from hostile tribes, slug it out on alibies 
All for love, all just lies, open those eyes (sing) 

Love conquers all (L-O-V-E love) 
Love conquers all (L-O-V-E love) 
When hate is strong, fear stands tall 
Love conquers all 
(Woah) It's only love, yeah 
Love conquers all 

Anyone who loves you, anyone who breaks your heart 
Anyone who makes you feel this way 

Feelings deep enough to swim in 
Back stroke, or crawl 
It's just the beginning 
Love conquers all 

Love conquers all (L-O-V-E love) 
Love conquers all (L-O-V-E love) 
You can beg, steal or crawl (L-O-V-E love) 
Love conquers all (L-O-V-E love) 

When hate is strong, fear stands tall 
Love conquers all 
L-O-V-E, L-O-V-E love conquers all
