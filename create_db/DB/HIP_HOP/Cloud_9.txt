Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright

I am walking along a very cold road and,
Wherever it ends and where it begins,
I do not know (oh no)
But I've noticed that (uh-huh)
It keeps rollin' and (uh-huh)
It'll take you anywhere, don't matter where your going yeah

[Chorus]
So I just want to let you know that,
I'm about to let it blow
Ain't on that middle grade no,
It's that professional
It ain't gone be no pain
I'm about to let it go (let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go)
Goodbye (goodbye), I'll be gone for a while, I'm on cloud 9
(i said goodbye)
I'll be gone for a while, I'll see you next time
I'll be gone for a while, I on cloud 9
(I said goodbye)
I'll be gone for a while, I'll see you next time

Now I really ain't the type tuh (uh-huh)
Be braggin about my wife but (uh-huh)
Mary jane is outta sight and (uh-huh)
She can do it all night and (fa show)
Best believe she down to blow where (was-sup)
Ever ya tryin' to go and (was-sup)
Oh no you don't need no lotion (was-sup)
Just a blunt and a nigga to roll it (fa show)

[Chorus]

Bye(bye), bye(bye), I said good-bye (i say goodbye)
Bye(bye), bye(bye), goodbye (goodbye)
Bye(bye), bye(bye), I said goodbye
