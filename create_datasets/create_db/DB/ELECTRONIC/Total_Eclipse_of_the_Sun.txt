The beauty, tender glow extinguished 
The sky dull from a breeze 
Ghostly the dawn without its red 
Uncanny, estranged to our nature 
The light like lead 

Ripped in the dark 
A tiny sickle 
As small as cut by a surgical knife 

The suns last spark melts away 
Not unlike a dying wick 
Now stands disc on disc 
And crushes my heart 

All I really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really want to see 
Is a total eclipse of the sun 

All I really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really want to see 
Is a total eclipse of the sun 

'Ah' says everyone 
Just the birds are silent 
With surprise 

All I really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really want to see 
Is a total eclipse of the sun

All I really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really want to see 
Is a total eclipse of the sun 

All I really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really want to see 
Is a total eclipse of the sun 

All I really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really want to see 
Is a total eclipse of the sun
