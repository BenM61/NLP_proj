Lately I've been wondering why
You don't want to hold me like you did
I know I've told you time before
Confused in mind but always needing more, hey

Maybe if I told you now
The feeling is when you are next to me
You'd probably open up your wrongs
And let us be the way we ought to be, hey

But oh, maybe we can start again
And make it what it use to be
Maybe I'm just being foolish
To love you for always

Gently
(Gently, gently, gently)
Gently on my mind, yeah

Gently
(Gently, gently, gently)
Gently on my mind, yeah

I want to keep you close to me
And never, ever let you go away
?Cause having you means more to me
I've got to have your lovin? every day, hey

Thoughts of you ring in my mind
Remembering all the things we use to have
Can't you see it?s you I need
There can never be another love, no

But oh, baby we can start again
And make it what it use to be
Maybe I'm just being foolish
To love you for always

Gently
(Gently, gently, gently)
Gently on my mind, yeah

Gently
(Gently, gently, gently)
Gently on my mind, yeah

But oh, baby we can start again
And make it what it use to be
Maybe I'm just being foolish
To love you for always

Gently
I think about you all the time
I want you here all the time
Gently on my mind, yeah

Gently
'Cause having you here with me
Is the way we gently be
Gently on my mind, can't you see

Gently
I think about you all the time
I want you with me all the time
Gently on my mind, yeah

Gently
