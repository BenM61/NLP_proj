He has a powerful weapon
He charges a million a shot
An assassin that's second to none
The man with the golden gun

Lurking in some darkened doorway
Or crouched on a rooftop somewhere
In the next room, or this very one
The man with the golden gun

Love is required, whenever he's hired
It comes just before the kill
No one can catch him, no hitman can match him
For his million dollar skill

One golden shot means another poor victim
Has come to a glittering end
For a price, he'll erase anyone
The man with the golden gun

His eye may be on you or me
Who will he bang?
We shall see, oh yeah!

Love is required, whenever he's hired
It comes just before the kill
No one can catch him, no hitman can match him
For his million dollar skill

One golden shot means another poor victim
Has come to a glittering end
If you want to get rid of someone
The man with the golden gun
Will get it done
He'll shoot anyone
With his golden gun
