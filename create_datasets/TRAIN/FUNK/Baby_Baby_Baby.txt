And you want my love
Well that's alright
Well it will be there for you morning, noon and night
But you gotta be good
And do it right
Ain't got no time for part-time lovin' in my life

Well you wanna be loved (uh)
Hey that's O.K.
'Cause it falls in line right with my sexuality
But you gotta be down
A nickel gotta be true
'Cause otherwise this "B" ain't got no time for you

Oh baby, baby, baby
I got so much love in me
Ooh (baby, baby,) baby, baby, baby
'Cause if your're gonna get me off
You got to love me deep

Well you want my heart (uh)
And all my time
Well it won't be there if you can't deal with my mind
'Cause a girl like me (uh)
Won't stand for less
I require plenty conversation with my sex

Long as you know that I could have any man I want to
Baby that's actual and factual
But still I choose you to be with me
And work on me so you better not flake it up

Oh baby, baby, baby
I got so much love in me
Ooh (baby, baby,) baby, baby, baby
'Cause if your're gonna get me off
You got to love me deep

Baby long as you know that I could have any man I want to
Baby that's actual and factual
But still I choose you to be with me
And work on me so you better not flake it up

Well you want my heart
And all my time
Well it won't be there if you can't deal with my mind
'Cause a girl like me
I won't stand for less
I require plenty conversation with my sex

Oh baby, baby, baby
I got so much love in me
Ooh (baby, baby,) baby, baby, baby
'Cause if your're gonna get me off
You got to love me deep

I can have any man that I want to
Time and place that I choose to
But I think you know that I'd rather be here with you

Yeah
That's actual and factual
You're the one I seem to run back to
Just to get me off
You got to love me, got to love me, got to love me
