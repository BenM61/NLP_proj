Well, me and my girl went out the other night
Down lovers lane we were walkin'
She said, "Honey child, do you love me?"
Right away I started talkin'

Is a bluebird blue?
Has a cat got a tail?
Hmm, is a blue bird blue?
Well honey, I love you

Well, I held her close and kissed her
Then, I looked in those big green eyes
She said, "A hey boy, do you love me?"
I said, "I wouldn't be at all surprised"

Is a bluebird blue?
Can a big wheel roll?
Hmm, is a bluebird blue
Then honey, I love you

Well, she finally believed my story
Said, "Baby, I understand"
Well, I'm gonna be your little lovin' girl
And you'll be my big lovin' man

Is a bluebird blue?
Ah, has a bear got hair?
Hmm, is a bluebird blue?
Then honey, I love you

Ah, is a bluebird blue, baby?
Tell me honey, has a bear got hair?
Ooh, can a big wheel roll?
Has a cat got a tail?
