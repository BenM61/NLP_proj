[Chorus:]
Yo, you suckers is playin' a role
You niggaz is out of control
This world could swallow you whole
The evil could snatch your soul

Yo nigga put the gun away, or you get done away
If not today there'll be a bullet for you one day
The gun play used to be the forte
As a youth, bustin' shots off the roof for horseplay
But once you get a glimpse of the shots, flyin' at you
You think about the possibility of dying and that's true
You won't be stressin' the gun my son
You'll be askin' the Lord for a chance, just one
Trials and tribulations, critical situations
Read it in revelations, check the configuration
They poison our population no matter your occupation
No matter your congregation, this is a troubled nation

[Chorus x2] 

I've seen the worst of the worst, I've seen the best of the best
Seems like the weight of the world is ridin' on my chest
A universal pain, my soul has absorbed
Don't respect no phonies, don't pay attention to frauds
The Lord only knows the depths of my sorrow
And some don't follow because their brains are hollow
So swallow these words and observe the signs
Yo turbulent times, are disturbin' the minds
of the youth, and ghetto life, is the proof
The only skills that's taught, is how to cock and to shoot
Poverty crack guns, hustlers stack ones
Take money is the motto cause we all lack funds

[Chorus x2] 

Nobody owes you nuttin' so you better get yours
My desire flows like sweat, from my open pores
My sores heal, but still the scars remain
A lot of niggaz gonna feel, much more pain
But yo I guess that's life, it don't make things right
Been through a lot of fights, cause ignorance makes me uptight
And cats be thinkin', that us rappers ain't real
And other cats be thinkin' street life is all about steel
Some of this may be, but yo, look in my face
Cause can't none of why'all bitches ever stand in my place
Pop the Remi, some for L, Tah, 'Pac and Biggie
Really? Niggaz want to stop the jiggy?
F*ck a willie, still you know you gots to dig me
The city, rotten to the core, no pity
The crowds roar, scavengers are out to get me
I want to live, I'm tryin' hard to stay positive

[Chorus x2] 

"Brother do the math...stay alive...it's alright!"
