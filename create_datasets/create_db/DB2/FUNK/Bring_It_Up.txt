Gather round, clap your hands
Come on and dance, dig the band

Come on, hit it
Come on, hit it, hit it

Hit it, come on, baby
Get in the groove
Come on, baby
Let's make it smooth on Hipsville

Hit it

All these guys and girls
Are dressed so neat and clean
Come on, baby, yeah
Don't be so mean

Girls and guys, gather round
Come on everybody
And dig this sound, oh, oh

Hit it, bring it up
Bring it up, bring it up

Can you do the jerk
Then watch me work
Can you do the slide
Then watch me glide

Bring it up, oh, bring it up, bring it up
Oh no, oh no, hit it
Bring it up, bring it up, baby
Bring it up now, hey, bring it up
Bring it up, bring it, bring it on up
