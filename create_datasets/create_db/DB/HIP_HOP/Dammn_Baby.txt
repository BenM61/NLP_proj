Dammn, baby, baby
I gotta hear me
Dammn, baby, baby
Dammn
Ya same ol' song
Is draggin me down
Not good for my body
Change it up
'Cause it ain't nothing like
Having your own ID
My lane's been stuck
I've never been afraid
To switch oh no not me
And they show me love
For bein' original

And tell 'em make room
Shake the room
Bang bang ya gon gon get it
You gotta get up off that grey line
And can't nobody tell you
What you can't do
Shut that down automatic
And I'll guarantee they'll fall in line
Watch 'em all go

Dammn baby baby, watch 'em all go
Dammn baby baby, watch 'em all go
Dammn baby baby, watch 'em all go
Dammn baby baby

A brand new movement
That started with a
Conversation in a cafe
It's all about love
And how we ain't gon' never let
Words get in the way
When you're giving it up
It's never what you say
It sayin' what you do
You wanna show me love
Let's keep that conversation going, honey

And tell 'em make room
Shake the room
Bang bang ya gon gon get it
You gotta get up off that grey line
And can't nobody tell you
What you can't do
Shut that down automatic
And I'll guarantee they'll fall in line
Watch 'em all go

Dammn baby baby, watch 'em all go
Dammn baby baby, watch 'em all go
Dammn baby baby, watch 'em all go
Dammn baby baby
And now, the break girl
Plush
Gonna break it down, break it down, break it down
Gonna break it down, break it down
Gonna break it down, break it down
Watching them all go dammn, hoo, huh
Watching them all go dammn, baby huh
Watching them all go dammn baby, huh
Come on
And tell 'em make room
Shake the room
Bang bang ya gon' gon' get it
You gotta get up off that grey line
And can't nobody tell you
What you can't do
Shut that down automatic
And I'll guarantee they'll fall in line
Watch 'em all go

Dammn baby baby, watch 'em all go
Dammn baby baby, watch 'em all go
Dammn baby baby, watch 'em all go
Dammn baby baby, watch 'em all go

Dammn baby baby, watch 'em all go
Dammn baby baby, watch 'em all go
Dammn baby baby, watch 'em all go
Dammn baby
Dammn
