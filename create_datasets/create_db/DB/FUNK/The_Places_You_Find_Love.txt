It was raining when I met you
You were soaking wet
No time to be impressed
I remember so much later on

I knew that you were someone
I would not forget
Everybody's searching, hungry for the glamour
You know too many hearts are in a rush

No matter how you try to
You can't explain
The places you find love
I can't explain it, but I can feel it

All around me
The need to find the place
Where feeling can be safe
It's not money that buys happiness

No, it's not the shine of silver that puts the heart to rest
Everybody's pushing
The clock is always running and
No one ever seems to have enough

And when you least expect it
You come upon the places you find love-love-love
Remember in a flash the feeling can hit you
After all the times that it missed you

Reaching deep inside to find your secret heart, yeah, yeah
Look around you notice you're flying
And for once you're not even trying
City lights below you like a million tiny stars, oh yeah

It's a river never stopping
Winding in and out
But you should never doubt
It will lead you

To the ocean someday
There's no way to fight it
Let it carry you away
Everybody's dreaming waiting for the feeling

That moment when they finally rise above
But it's always in the giving
That gets you to the places you find love-love
Remember in the poorest part of town

Where the sun never reaches the ground
And seeing's not believing
The feeling stays alive-yeah, yeah
Little children laughing and playing

'Cause they haven't learned to start hating
Never giving up-no
'Cause they still believe in love, sweet love
Love, love, love, love, love

Remember in a flash the feeling can hit you
After all the times that it missed you
Reaching deep inside to find your secret heart-yeah, yeah
Look around you notice you're flying

And for once you're not even trying
City lights below you
Like a million tiny stars
In the poorest part of town

Where the sun never reaches the ground
Seeing's not believing
The feeling stays alive-yeah, yeah
Little children laughing and playing

'Cause they haven't learned to start hating
Never giving up-no
They still believe in love-sweet love
In a flash the feeling can hit you

After all the times that it missed you
Reaching deep inside to find your secret heart, yeah, yeah
Look around you notice you're flying
And for once you're not even trying

City lights below you like a million tiny stars
In the poorest part of town
Where the sun never reaches the ground
And seeing's not believing
The feeling stays alive-year, yeah
