So far its perfect, the clothes you wear. 
This won't concern you, just hurts a bit...

(I don't mind you playing God) Blame you!
(I don't mind you playing God) No Trust!
(I don't mind you playing God) Came to!
(I don't mind you...)

I know you'll be back again...
Time slows - beginning of the end...

Black eyes she'll cover, her broken mouth... 
She won't tell mother, just hurts a bit...

(I don't mind you playing God) Blame you!
(I don't mind you playing God) No Trust!
(I don't mind you playing God) Came to!
(I don't mind you...) Your life self-destructs!

I know you'll be back again... 
Time slows, beginning of the end...
I know you'll be back again... 
Time slows, beginning of the end...

I know this complicates you now, say your mine!
Yeah!
I know you'll be back again... 
Time slows, beginning of the end...
I know you'll be back again (again, again, again, and again)... 
Time slows, beginning of the end (end)...

The End...
(I don't mind you playing God...)
The End...
The End...
(I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind)
The End...
