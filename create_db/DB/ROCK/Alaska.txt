The road is dry I'm fucking delirious right now 
Life goes on glorious evening of nodding and jumping starts 
I need to make a personal dance party. 
The brain works very weird at this hour 
Not the best time for lyrics I suppose keep writing, keep dreaming. 

Nope, can't be awake and dream, drift in and out, in and out. 

Eye motions in out heat lightning, 
Scares us both the only two people awake at this fucking hour 
I won't remember this in the morning at least I wrote this all down 
Please pick the right song the one 
That keeps the eyes wide creepy yes, 
Creepy the idea of control controlling death 
With alertness when is the fucking sun coming up. 

Then it all changes, same scenery 
But sun involved shouldn't be much different 
Alaska the brain works very weird at this hour. 
Tick tock tick tock the rain is pouring now wide awake 
At least for now nature can be the death of me 
A thing we'll never overcome in out in out.
