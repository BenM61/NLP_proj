I used to wake up every morning
Feeling down, down, down
And my heart was filled with sadness
Like a clown, clown, clown

I didn't care for anybody
I was cool, oh, so cool
I'd been hiding out from true love
Like a fool, fool, fool

Hello, world, today I feel like someone
Hello, world, today I sing a bad song
Hello, world, now I know
What love can do for me

Hello, world, hello, hello
Hello, world, hello, hello

I used to think that life was dull
Though I was young, young, young
And that all the songs worth singing
Had been sung, sung, sung

When I woke up early morning
Feeling blue, oh, so blue
And opened back the curtains
And the sun shone through

Hello, world, today I feel like someone
Hello, world, today I sing a bad song
Hello, world, now I know
What love can do for me

Hello, world, hello, hello
Hello, world, hello, hello
