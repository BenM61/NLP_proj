Blind eyes of justice, 
Deaf ears of power
Dumb moves on money
Left us in a desperate hour
Economy
Connin' me out of my sanity

Rebellious revolution
Is this the final solution?

Hands in surrender, 
Killed in they tracks 
Babies, women raped
Leaders on they back
Religious delusions
Stone confusion

Rebellious revolution
Is this the final solution?

The proof of man's insanity
The truth of war's inhumanity
Let's all just pray on it right now!

Guerrilla warfare
Lady Liberty
Propaganda, 
Hypocrisy
Did we lose our Constitution?

Rebellious revolution
Is this the final solution?
Rebellious revolution
Is this the final solution?
The final solution
