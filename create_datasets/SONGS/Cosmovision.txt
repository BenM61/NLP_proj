Astronomers, constallation of the past
Alien faces, explanation of the lines
Spiders, carved on the ground
Eagles, lying around

Andes building a stellar nation
Incas tracing the Cosmovision

Nazca's observers, calling the people of the space
Andean explorers, builders of the human fate
Spiders, carved on the ground
Eagles, lying around

Andes building a stellar nation
Incas tracing the Cosmovision
Andes building a stellar nation
Incas tracing the Cosmovision

It's time to preach for the future of mankind
Time will tell the meaning of these lines

Civilization, awaiting a sign on tablelands
Solar religion, lost on the Nazca's plains
Spiders, carved on the ground
Eagles, lying around

Andes building a stellar nation
Incas tracing the Cosmovision
Andes building a stellar nation
Incas tracing the Cosmovision
