One of these days
You know it won't be long
You'll look for me
And baby I'll be long gone
I'll be down the road
You'll look for me
But me you won't see
Yeah, one of these days
You know the time is near
You'll look for me
But baby I won't be here
I'm gonna be long gone
You'll look for me
But me you won't see
Yeah, one of these days
You're gonna wake up and find
This lonesome boy has changed
His cotton-picking mind
He's gonna be long gone
You'll look for he
But he you won't see

Yeah, one of these days
You know the time is near
You'll look for me
But baby I won't be here
I'm gonna be long gone
You'll look for me
But me you won't see

Yeah, one of these days
I said it won't be long
You'll look for me
But baby I'll be long gone
I'll be down the road
You'll look for me
But me you won't see
Long gone!
Long gone!
Long gone!
Long gone!
You'll look for me
And me you won't see

Long gone!
Long gone!
Long gone!
Long gone!
You'll look for me
And me you won't see
