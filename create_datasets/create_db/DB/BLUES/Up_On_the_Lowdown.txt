When I think that I know nothing, it's all feelings
My friends keep me down to ground, they peel me off the ceiling
And that's what's so surprising
They used to seem so shy
But I only know 'cause so am I
It keeps me hanging around
It keeps me up on the lowdown
Up on the lowdown.

Cause I been closer listening, I can hear you
All that stuff that I'd been missing, it warms me now I'm near you
And that's what's so surprising
You used to seem so cold
But I only know what I been told
I hear it down in town
It keeps me up on the lowdown
Up on the lowdown.

I might try to scream and cry just to test you
Then something makes me listen in, it rushes to my rescue
And that's what's so surprising
It all seems so well-timed
That it won't shake any more suspicious minds
But I just like the sound
It keeps me up on the lowdown
Up on the lowdown.

And this simple secret is the key to my attraction
Makes me feel like such a king, it keeps me on the action
And that's what's so surprising
Nobody has to know
Cause I can keep it here, it hardly shows
Underneath my crown
It keeps me up on the lowdown
Up on the lowdown.
