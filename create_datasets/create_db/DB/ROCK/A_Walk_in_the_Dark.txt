It's long after midnight and the city sleeps 
We're driving alone through the park 
Somehow I just don't feel like going home 
Let's take a walk in the dark 

Don't be afraid of what you can't see 
Follow the road in your heart 
Don't be afraid you'll be safe with me 
Let's take a walk in the dark 

There's not one soul in the park, 
Let's take a walk in the dark 
This is the way I want to dance with you 
Silhouettes beneath the moon and stars 

This is the night I've always dreamed about 
Let's take a walk in the dark 
I wrap my arms around you, 
Your heart beats next to mine 

I can feel you breathing in and out of time 
Feel the gentle motion, the softness of your skin 
Surrender to the rapture, deep within 
There's not one soul in the park, 

Let's take a walk in the dark 
Follow the road in your heart, 
Let's take a walk in the dark 
A walk in the dark 
He dreams of love, one night of love
