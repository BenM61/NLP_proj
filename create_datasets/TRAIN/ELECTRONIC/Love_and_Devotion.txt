Star light
Star bright
Please shine your light on me tonight
I pray 
I can get away
Go where I need to be.

Can I cross the line
What must I say to make you mine

We all need some love
And devotion
We all need some
Love and devotion
Love and devotion

Darling if you ever need a friend
Come to me
I always be
The thing that you want and you
You need

I can do it in the nighttime
I can do it in the morning
Afternoon 
Night of dark
We can do it in the park
It don't matter 
I need some love and devotion

We all need some love
And devotion
We all need some
Love and devotion
Love and devotion
