Be somebody, be somebody, be somebody
Be somebody, be somebody, be somebody

I can tell by looking in your eyes
There is something on your mind
Restless soul, it's time to let you go
There's a dream out there, I know you got to find

So if you take the love that I will give to you
Then I won't feel like I'm losing you

I want you to be somebody, be somebody, be somebody
I know you can be somebody, be somebody strong
To me you will always be somebody, be somebody, be somebody
Never do wrong, wrong, never do wrong, no
Always be strong, strong, always be strong

People change, it happens all the time
Still it hurts to say goodbye, don't say goodbye
So if my tears are getting in your way
I'm imagining how young wings learn to fly

So shine your light for all the world to see
Share the love you feel but save the best for me

I want you to be somebody, be somebody, be somebody
I know you can be somebody, be somebody strong
To me you will always be somebody, be somebody, be somebody
Never do wrong, wrong, no, always be strong
If you need me, you can count on me

If you ever, ever, ever need somebody, need somebody
Let me somebody
To me you will be somebody, be somebody strong
In my heart you'll always be somebody, be somebody, be somebody
You'll never do wrong, wrong, wrong
You'll always be strong
