The east is red tonight, she's really gonna do it right
She bought a ticket on the midnight flight, that takes her home to you
She tried living in an ivory tower, but every night around the midnight hour
She'd begin to feel the power, can't you feel it too?
 Chorus:
Dark sunglasses and a cheap disguise, never gonna hide those hungry eyes
Everybody knows when the girl walks by, never gonna hide those hungry eyes
Black night like a velvet sky, the kinda evening when the world is high
You can leave it, you can let it die, and never feel the heat
She says, "If you want to run away with me, if you want to set the lions free
We can take it to the ninth degree, down between the sheets"
