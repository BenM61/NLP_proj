A sleepy lagoon, a tropical moon and two on an island
A sleepy lagoon and two hearts in tune in some lullaby land
The fireflies' gleam reflects in the stream
They sparkle and shimmer
A star from on high falls out of the sky
And slowly grows dimmer
The leaves from the trees all dance in the breeze
And float on the ripples
We're deep in a spell as nightingales tell
Of roses and dew
The memory of this moment of love
Will haunt me forever
A tropical moon, a sleepy lagoon
And you
