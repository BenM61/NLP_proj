The dream I'm building is early American,
Something that won't go out of style.
It makes you feel that life's worth living,
The way they must have felt that first Thanksgiving.

You sure get sold on this early American,
After you've looked around awhile,
So I'm building a dream for someone who
Likes early American too.
