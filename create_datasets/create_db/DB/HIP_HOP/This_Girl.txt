Make me feel like I'm falling, skydiver
Rotating behind helicopters
That's the rush that I get when I'm thinking of you
Give me wings, make me fly
Wake me up, make me shine
Pull me close, slow me down
Want it all
'Cause I need you know

Do it one more time for this girl
One more time for this girl
Do it one more time, one more time
Do it one more time for this girl
(This girl)

This girl

This girl

On the back, on the ride, supersonic
Yeah, I'm racing inside 'cause we got it
In your arms till the end, keep revolving with you
Give me wings, make me fly
Wake me up, make me shine
Tonight, beg around
Point it up, 'cause I need you now

Do it one more time for this girl
One more time for this girl
Do it one more time, one more time
Do it one more time for this girl

This, girl (Alright, Hustle gang, over everything)

Okay, I know Ma
I done had so many chances, give me uno mas
You can catch me somewhere spazzing in a two door car
I'm thinking me on you, me and you on her
I'll let you have it till you pass out when you woke up
I give it to your ass again about a quarter to 10
Now before I begin and let it slip away
I'm gettin' this in order again here
I'mma need me a lawyer again
Back up in the trust like quarters again
Before you know it again, we be hopping out the Bentley tryna order a Benz
Have a party in the mansion on the water with friends
Would you prefer to make war, or make amends
Or, make love from the bed to the floor
One more time for old time's sake I'm sure I could

Do it one more time for this girl
One more time for this girl
Do it one more time, one more time
Do it one more time for this girl

This girl
This girl
