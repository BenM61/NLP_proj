I bring the light
You get to see
You bring the love
It's ecstasy

I see no point in what you're thinking
I'm going out I'm taking you drinking
I get the car, you're getting up
I'm standing tall, well fucking tough
It's just your way, you hear me wrong
I hear you say you're getting up, getting up

Baby hold on
Baby come on
Baby come on
You're gettin' up, gettin' up
Baby hold on
Baby come on
Baby come on
You're gettin' up, gettin' up

I bring the light
You get to see
You bring the love
It's ecstasy

I see no point in what you're thinking
I'm going out I'm takin' you drinkin'
I'm coming in, you're coming out
I'm coming up, you're coming down
It's just you're way, you do me wrong
I hear you say you're gettin' up, gettin' up

Baby hold on
Baby come out
Baby come out
You're gettin' up, gettin' up
Baby hold on
Baby come on
Baby come on
You're gettin' up, gettin' up

Baby come on
Baby come on
Baby come on
Baby come on
come on, come on, come on,come on

Well, baby come on
come on, come on, come on,come on
