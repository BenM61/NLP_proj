Club packed, know I'm a be there all night
Tired as hell, jet-lag, just got off a flight
But that don't stop me
Who? Not me
Pop 1 bottles pop 2 bottles pop 3

7, 8, 9, so they all dimes, O.G.
Louis frame match my Louis kicks on my fifth right?
Dirty lame look at me wrong? Tell 'em get right
Light reflecting off the Bentley watch, now I'm lit right?
6's on the candy Range just so I can sit right
Hotter if ya chick nice, I can triple his price
On the black card, got 'em hating, wanna fist fight?
Man don't get ya shit sliced, yea I hope the fifth tight
We tryna party, lil' homie don't mess up this night
It's a D.T.P. thang, wall-to-wall, it's hype
Me, Luda, and Valentine, we living this life

I just want that gushy, gimme dat (gushy)

(Verse 2: Ludacris)
Ching-A-Ling, I gotta car full of women
And a truck full of beat
Air full of smoke
Le box full of heat
Heat it and repeat it every day!
Heat it and repeat it every day!
If the cops ain't on my bumper everything is ok

What you say
We cruise down the block
Droolz on my watch
Fools on my truck
So turn this tune up a notch
Cause my whip game's proper
Bentley drop topper
Clubs on Luda
Drinks on shoka

Imma mash that woman
Smash that woman
Jump, shot, fake and pass that woman
Over to Bobby V.
And tell her to swallow he!
Oops did I say that?
Good oh golly me
Cause it's
Probably 3 more women in tha cut
Talkin' bout tonight
They tryna get
Fucked up!

And who tha hell would I be
If I ain't grant them they wish
Well sure his hells not Ludacris
who is this that got they pockets on swole, big bank rolls
A bad lil' mamma, and she ready to go
I'm Like...
I just want that gushy, gimme dat (gushy)
I just want that gushy, baby that's (awww)

I got my pockets all swole, big bank rolls
A bad lil' mamma, and she ready to go

(Verse 3: Chingy)
My whip flash
You my catch whip glass
When ya boy dip past
Man ain't none of ya'll cold as me
My chick lash she ain't roll this past
Watch that new six stash
Why cant none of ya'll roll like me
Don't get mad blame my momma dem
Plus the Cadillac gangsta grill
But don't call me Drama then
My flows listen to em you my final summit then
Is a couple celebrity chicks yeh

A bad lil' mamma, and she ready to go
