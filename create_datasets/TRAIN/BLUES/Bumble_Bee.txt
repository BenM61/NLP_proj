Bumble bee, bumble bee
Please come back to me
Bumble bee, bumble bee
Please come back to me
He got the best old stinger
Any bumble bee that I ever seen

He stung me this morning
I been looking for him all day long
He stung me this morning
I been looking for him all day long
Lord, it got me to the place
Hate to see my bumble bee leave home

Bumble bee, bumble bee
Don't be gone so long
Bumble bee, bumble bee
Don't be gone so long
You's my bumble bee
And you're needed here at home

I can't stand to hear him
Buzz, buzz, buzz
Come in, bumble bee
Want you to stop your fuss
You're my bumble bee
And you know your stuff
Oh, sting me, bumble bee
Until I get enough

Bumble bee, bumble bee
Don't be gone so long
Bumble bee, bumble bee
Don't be gone so long
You's my bumble bee
And you're needed here at home

I don't mind you going
Ain't going to stay so long
Don't mind you going
Don't be gone so long
You's my bumble bee
And you're needed here at home

I can't stand to hear him
Buzz, buzz, buzz
Come in, bumble bee
I want you to stop your fuss
You's my bumble bee
And you know your stuff
Oh, sting me, bumble bee
Until I get enough
