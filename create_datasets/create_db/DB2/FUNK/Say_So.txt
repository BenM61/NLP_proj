This feels like something special
So won't you tell me just how you feel?
One little sign would be helpful
To let me know that these feelings are real

Whatever you need, guaranteed
I will give it to you
Whatever the cost, everything that I've got
I will give it to you, yeah

If you want me to love you
All that you must do
Is just say so (say so, say so, say so)
I am ready to love you
All that you must do
Is just say so (say so, say so, say so)

You've got that look on your face
Giving me reason to think that you might
Want me to fill up this space
That has been empty for all of these nights, yeah
