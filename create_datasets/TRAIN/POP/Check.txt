Hold me, never said you're gonna do that
Move me, never said that you would do that
Now, love me, never said that you would do that
No no no no, babe, look what you do to me, no

Baby, I'm chillin' outside
Baby, come and look into my eyes
Yeah, I know the feelin' is right
Girl, I just need you tonight, need you tonight
Baby girl, you're coming around
I know you're staying around
Because you never wanna leave, bombaclat
And then I go in and out and then I hear your sounds
Saying I'm everything you need, oh yeah
You wanna know where we can go
All the way to Fernando
You wanna be my Nintendo
But you gotta know I don't play no games

Everything I say is true
I'd be a mess here without you
And I'll hold you down, you don't need to stress
So let me just lay upon your chest

She makin' me weed check
Grinder check
Rizla check
I got the lighter check
Roll the weed and let me smoke the zest
And you can lay upon my chest

Down low
Looking like you care what you came for
Tell me what you want, is it me, though?
Love it when you watch how my weed smokes so loud
Feel me?
And you best pick it up when I FaceTime
'Cause you know that you're all mine
Know I'ma roll in my car, come wherever you are
Come whenever you need to be together

Everything I say is true
I'd be a mess here without you
And I'll hold you down, you don't need to stress
So let me just lay upon your chest
