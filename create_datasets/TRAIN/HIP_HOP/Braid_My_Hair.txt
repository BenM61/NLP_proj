When you look at me I know 
You see a sixteen year-old 
Getting his dough
Back and forth to the studios
Hoppin' out of limousines
Rockin' the latest jeans
Jordan's-fresh
T-shirts-new
And even though these things are true
It's hard workin'
Sometimes I just want to 
Go home and tell my girl to?

Braid my hair
C'mon and braid my hair
Back in my 'hood
Feeling good 
No worries or no cares
Baby use your hands
To make me feel alright
And take away the stress and drama
In my life
While you braid my hair

You may think that I'm complaining
But that's not the case
All I'm sayin'
Is my body gets weak
My mind gets tired
I need sleep
But I gotta keep
Traveling on the road
Doing these shows
New York to Cali
Dallas to Philly
It's the rules of the game
That I chose to play
But sometimes I wanna say?

Braid my hair
C'mon and braid my hair
Back in my 'hood
Feeling good 
No worries or no cares
Baby use your hands
To make me feel alright
And take away the stress and drama
In my life
While you braid my hair

Sit me down like you love me
Do it anyway you want
Baby, take it slowly
Front to back, side to side
Crisscross 
Get creative wit it
Girl, do your thang
Put it down like you love me
Let your fingers do the walkin'
And your lips do the talkin'
In my ear tell me what I wanna hear
I swear I can't wait for you to?

Braid my hair
C'mon and braid my hair
Back in my 'hood
Feeling good 
No worries or no cares
Baby use your hands
To make me feel alright
And take away the stress and drama
In my life
While you braid my hair
