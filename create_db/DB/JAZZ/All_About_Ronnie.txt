All about Ronnie,
There's so much to tell!
All about Ronnie,
I know him so well!

His magical fingers,
Their sense of embrace;
His whisper that lingers,
Caressing you face.

All about Ronnie,
Best told in a toast;
Let me propose it,
He's my favourite host!

We'll drink from dry glasses,
There's no need for wine!
The champagne is Ronnie,
And Ronnie is mine!
