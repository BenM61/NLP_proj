Between Sunday and Monday
Between Sunday and Monday
When will I forget that I'm in love with you
When the sky above forgets to be blue
When the grass in the spring forgets to be green
And little children forget the sweet taste of ice cream
The day will come between Sunday and Monday boy
The day will come between Sunday and Monday boy
That's the day I'll stop loving you
That's the day I'll stop loving you
When will I forget all the sweet love you give
When the good man above forgets to forgive
When a boy flying a kite no longer needs the wind
And a duck on a pond forgets how to swim
The day will come between Sunday and Monday boy
The day will come between Sunday and Monday boy
That's the day I'll stop loving you
That's the day I'll stop loving you
When will I forget how I love you sounds
When my ears go deaf and the world shuts down
I can't lend a day when your love I'll forget
It hasn't been meant but I know where it's at
The day will come between Sunday and Monday boy
The day will come between Sunday and Monday boy
That's the day I'll stop loving you
That's the day
The day will come between Sunday and Monday boy
The day will come between Sunday and Monday boy
That's the day I'll stop loving you
That's the day
The day will come between Sunday and Monday boy
The day will come between Sunday and Monday boy
