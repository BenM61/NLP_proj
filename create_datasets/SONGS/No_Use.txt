There's no use moving around
There's no use changing my mind

Ain't no dream
But a mental desert
Like a scream inside my mind
What am I supposed to do?
Used to miss the hidden signs
It's too late for more advice
What am I supposed to do?

There's no use turning around
There's no use, leave it behind

There is no use (no use)

Abandon your past
Pain has nurtured me
Like my own destiny
What am I supposed to be?

Love is dead and gone
All tears I cried
Can't fight my thoughts
Of "fire-time"
Why do I believe in you?

There's no use turning around
There's no use, leave it behind

There is no use
