You know we trap all day, play all night
This is the life of a, the life of a go getta (eh!)
Go getta (eh!), go getta (yeah!)
And in the club, you see a bad bitch; point her out (oh!)
Yeah, you damn right I'm a (eh!)
You damn right I'm a go getta (eh!)
Go getta (eh!), go getta (yeah!)

In the immediate state they callin' me Will Smith
Thing on my side, you can call that Jada
The boys talkin' down; yeah, we call 'em hatas
I'm ballin' right now, so we'll get back to that later
Be the first to admit I'm such an alcoholic
Only blow that good shit, yeah, that whatchamacallit
Catch me posted on the block in something exotic
'07, yeah, same color Hypnotic
I'm on the outside lookin', and I want in
My homie did the same thing, and he got ten
Just took a loss; still tryin' two win
And you tryin' to get back, so what you tryin' to spend?

You know we trap all day, play all night
This is the life of a, the life of a go getta (eh!)
Go getta (eh!), go getta (yeah!)
And in the club, you see a bad bitch; point her out (oh!)
Yeah, you damn right I'm a (eh!)
You damn right I'm a go getta (eh!)
Go getta (eh!), go getta (yeah!)

We live life on the edge like there's no tomorrow (yeah)
They grind hard like there's no today
They do the same shit like it's yesterday
The game never stop so who's next to play?
Against all odds you can place your bets
Yeah, I'm just gettin' started, so I ain't done yet (naw)
Risk it all, you can lose your life
What else can I say?  That's a hell of a price (damn)
I don't under 'cause I over-stand
No time for mistakes, so I over-plan
I'm in the club like what?
Four-five wit' me, and I'm a stay thuggin' till the feds come get me

You know we trap all day, play all night
This is the life of a, the life of a go getta (eh!)
Go getta (eh!), go getta (yeah!)
And in the club, you see a bad bitch; point her out (oh!)
Yeah, you damn right I'm a (eh!)
You damn right I'm a go getta (eh!)
Go getta (eh!), go getta (yeah!)

Hey, hey, this is how we play
When we roll up to the club high, sittin' on twenty treys
Hop out like we fabulous
Top models grabbin' us
They love them go gettas, only in America
Put D on chicks like Wallace
Turn 'em, throw 'em down
Thinkin' they can have all this
Can't deny it when you see the wheels spinnin'
Boy Kells out the coupe in Miami white linen
Chips big spendin', walk out the club with a shit load a women
Soon as I see one I like, I'm a go getta
I'm a get it 'cause I'm a go getta

You know we trap all day, play all night
This is the life of a, the life of a go getta (eh!)
Go getta (eh!), go getta (yeah!)
And in the club, you see a bad bitch; point her out (oh!)
Yeah, you damn right I'm a (eh!)
You damn right I'm a go getta (eh!)
Go getta (eh!), go getta (yeah!)
