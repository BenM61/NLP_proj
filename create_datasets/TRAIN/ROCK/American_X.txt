Close your eyes to the world that you see
And open wide to the one in your dreams
There's nothing left that you wanna believe
Foreign eyes have been torn at the seams

You'd save yourself from a world without sin
You're born again with a means to an end
You're drawing lines in the palm of your hand
You're holding on to all that you've planned

There's nothing here that is left to be saved
Take a bow to the warrior state
You throw yourself to the perilous static
You shut your eyes but the death is romantic

You've sold your soul but it's only a fake
You'd kill yourself for a piece of the take
You lose your mind in a world that leaves nothin?
You're holding on for asylum, reaching for air

It's all you want, you know you'll never forget
Your open arms, they only seem to surrender
It's all you know, you know you'll never regret
Your open arms, they only seem to surrender all that matters

No one needs what they think to survive
You're pulled inside with an appetite blind
You feast your eyes on American sex
You sleep in shores of American bliss

Growing wings from the sorrowless excess
Your frozen eyes cut the chord to their last depth
You share your young with the wolves of a nation
There's nothing left till you pray for salvation

It's all you want, you know you'll never forget
Your open arms, they only seem to surrender all that matters
It's all you know, you know you'll never regret
Your open arms, they only seem to surrender all that matters
