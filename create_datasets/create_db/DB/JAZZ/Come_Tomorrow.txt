Old man spat and cursed as he spoke
It's all going to hell and the whole world is broken
Little kid is busy making plans
Save the whole world along with that old man

It's far as I can see
A better way for you and me
Is to let the children run the show
Not too long and we'd be good to go

All the girls and boys would sing
Come tomorrow we get everything
So as long as we survive today
Come tomorrow, we're gonna find a way

Yeah, as far as I can see
We should let the children lead the way

Bang bang you're dead now could be real
I got a bag of smoke come on let's make a deal
Yeah, bridges burn but tomorrow is another day
To feed the world and then go outside and play

Yeah, farmers farm and dancers dance all night
Lovers love and the firefighters fight
Let the children run the show
Not too long and we'd be good to go

All the girls and boys would sing
Come tomorrow we get everything
So as long as we survive today
Come tomorrow, we're gonna find a way

Yeah, as far as I can see
We gotta let the children lead the way

Storms will rise out of innocent skies
Times will change as you let the children play the game

All the girls and boys would sing
Come tomorrow we get everything
So as long as we survive today
Come tomorrow, we're gonna find a way

All the girls and boys would sing
Come tomorrow we get everything
So as long as we survive today
Come tomorrow, we're gonna find a way

All the girls and boys would sing
Come tomorrow we get everything
So as long as we survive today
Come tomorrow
