See the people walking down the street 
Fall in line just watching all their feet 
They don't know where they wanna go 
But they're walking in time 

They got the beat 
They got the beat 
Yeah 
They got the beat 

See the kids just getting out of school 
They can't wait to hang out and be cool 
Hang around 'til quarter after twelve 
That's when they fall in line 

Kids got the beat 
They got the beat 
They got the beat 
Yeah 
Kids got the beat 

Go-Go music really makes us dance 
Do the Pony puts us in a trance 
Do the Watusi just give us a chance 
That's when we fall in line 

We got the beat 
We got the beat 
We got the beat 
Yeah 
We got the beat
Everybody get on your feet
We know you can dance to the beat
Jumpin' - get down
Round and round and round
