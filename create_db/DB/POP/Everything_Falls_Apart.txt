If I listened to the things that you said
Everything would fall apart
If I did all the things that you do
Everything could fall apart
Let's not listen to the things that they say
Everything can fall apart
Let's think about our actions before we do them
Everything will fall apart

I got nothing to do
You got nothing to say
Everything is so fucked up
I guess it's natural that way.
Everything falls apart
Everything falls apart

If I did all the things that you do
Everything could fall apart
If I listened to all the things that you told me
Everything would fall apart
Let's think about our actions before we do them
Everything will fall apart
If we do all the things as we say
Everything can fall apart.

I got nothing to do
You got nothing to say
Everything is so fucked up
I guess it's natural that way
Everything falls apart
Everything falls apart

I got nothing to do
You got nothing to say
Everything is so fucked up
I guess we like it that way
Everything falls apart
Everything falls apart

If I listened to the things that you said everything ...
