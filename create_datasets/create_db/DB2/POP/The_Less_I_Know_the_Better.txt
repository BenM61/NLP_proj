Someone said they live together
Ran out the door together
She was holding hands with Trevor
Not the greatest feeling ever
Said pull yourself together
You should try your luck with Heather
And I hope they slept together
Oh the less I know the better
The less I know the better

Oh my love, can't you see yourself by my side
No surprise when you're on his shoulder like every night
Oh my love, can't you see a child on my mind
Don't suppose we could convince your lover to change his mind
So goodbye

She said it's not now or never
Waiting years we'll be together
I said better late than never
Just don't make me wait forever
Don't make me wait forever
Don't make me wait forever

Oh my love, can't you see yourself by my side
I don't suppose you could convince your lover to change it's mind
I was doing fine without ya, 'til I saw your face, now I can't erase
Eating in to all his bullshit
Is this what you want, is this who you are?
I was doing fine without ya, 'til I saw your eyes turn away from mine
He's not going where he wants you
Said come on superman, say your stupid line
Said come on superman, say your stupid line
Said come on superman, say your stupid line
