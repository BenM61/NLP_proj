I get tired and upset
And I'm trying to care a little less
When I Google I only get depressed
I was taught to dodge those issues I was told
Don't worry
Cos no doubt
There's always something to cry about
And when your stuck in an angry crowd
They don't think what they say before they open their mouth

You gotta

Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag
And bury them beneath the sea
I don't care what the people may say
What the people may say about me
Pack Up your troubles get your old grin back
Don't worry bout the cavalry
I don't care what the whisperers say
Cos they whisper too loud for me

Hot topic
Maybe I should drop it
It's a touchy subject
And I like to tiptoe round the ship going down
You got pennies but no pounds
So if your business is running out
It's not business to talk about
But they don't think what they say before they open their mouth

You gotta

Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag
And bury them beneath the sea
I don't care what the people may say
What the people may say about me
Pack up your troubles get your old grin back
Don't worry bout the cavalry
I don't care what the whisperers say
Cos they whisper too loud for me

Yeah

Pack up, pack up, pack up, pack up
Pack up, pack up, pack up, pack up
Pack up, pack up, pack up, pack up
Pack up, pack up, pack up, pack up
