They say it's a fact that your head is cracked
(I think now you are loco)
You have blown your stack, you're a maniac
(I think now you are loco)

I just heard the news that you blew a fuse
(I think now you are loco)
You're a paranoid and your head's a void
(I think now you are loco)

How did you get so coo coo

(Look in the mirror)
How did you get so coo coo

You are in a fog since you slipped a cog
(I think now you are loco)
They will set you free with lobotomy
(I think now you are loco)

Your cerebral vault has a single fault
(I think now you are loco)
It is quite well known you've become a clone
(I think now you are loco)
