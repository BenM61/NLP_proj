Guess we always knew 
Best of friends we'd always be 
Sister and brother we two 
Romance never entered our view 

Always you were there 
When I needed you 
Suddenly out of nowhere 
I realized I loved only you 

And that just how true love begins 
It just walks on in 
And one day I knew 
It was you... it was you 
It was always you 

Baby, in the end... I've got you as lover and friend 
Darling in the end I've got you as lover and friend 

Funny how it goes 
We'd be the last to know 
We were made for each other 
And from friends we became lovers 

Keep on being my friend 
Our love will never end 
We'll have it all 
Yes we will... yes we will 
Yes we will 

We're gonna have a happy ending 
We started our with such a great beginning 
We'll walk together talk together 
In every kind of weather 
We're bound together 
Forever yeah
