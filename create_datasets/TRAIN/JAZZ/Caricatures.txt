we 've got to love to love each other
we 've got to live like sister and brother

have you seen people coming out like you a saint
actin' like an angel but you really aint
why not try the new way  
what they can give
love your brothers and sisters 
give them a chance to live

smiling grimlin
alway usin some just like they are 
think thatyou are wise one
everyone else is fool

got to conver to people
change the way of thinkin
give them chance to be free

here you go brothers and sisters
great big helping hand
show the m how to spread it
over this one full lane
give them a chance to live

we love each other
always using someone like they were a two
change you r way of thinking
