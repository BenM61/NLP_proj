The wind cannot hear 
The wind cannot hear 
The wind cannot hear 
The wind cannot hear 

Said the straight man 
To the late man 
Where have you been 
I've been here and 
I've been there and 
I've been inbetween 

I talk to the wind 
My words are all carried away 
The wind cannot hear 
The wind cannot hear 
The wind cannot hear 

I'm on the outside 
Looking inside 
What do I see 
Much confusion 
Disillusion 
All around me 

I talk to the wind 
My words are all carried away 
The wind cannot hear 
The wind cannot hear 
The wind cannot hear 
The wind cannot hear (repeat) 

You don't possess me 
Don't impress me 
Just upset my mind 
Can't instruct me 
Or conduct me 
Just use up my time 

I talk to the wind 
My words are all carried away 
The wind cannot hear 
The wind cannot hear 
The wind cannot hear 
The wind cannot hear (repeat and fade)
