What's that sparkle in your eyes? 
Is it tears that I see? 
Oh tomorrow you are gone 
So tomorrow I'm alone 

Short moments of time 
We have left to share our love 
Hold, hold me for a while 
I know this won't last forever 

So hold, hold me tonight 
Before the morning takes you away 
We're in each others arms 
Soon we're miles apart 

Can you imagine how I'll miss, 
Your touch and your kiss? 
Short moments of time 
We have left to share our love 

Hold, hold me for a while.... 
Hold, hold me now, 
From dusk to dawn all night long 
Save, save me now, 

A short moment of time
