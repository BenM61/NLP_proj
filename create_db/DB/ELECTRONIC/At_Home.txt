Remember how I said I'd come someday baby,
How I said I'd come around to see you one day,
I said I'd try to find a way to run away I'd get away some day and I'm gonna come someday baby,
Gonna fire on the water, hear you say,
I'm gonna fire on the water, trying to find you again and say:
I never thought I'd see you,again I never thought I'd get to be with my best friend, never thought I had to tell you again, never thought I had to tell you how I lost my mind again.

I left alone, I left the world I was running,
To be by your side I was dying, alone by your side I was flying.
I came alone, I've come a long way to get here, the leaves they fall to my feet,at home, they mean nothing to me.
No no no, no no no, no no no, no no no, no no no, no no no yeah yeah, yeah yeah.

Remember everywhere, everything is in this place, take a place if you found a place to take,
Take away the way you want to walk away,
Make a way with my mind my mind's away,
Wake me up when I'm on the throw to paradise,
Lift me off the ground and take me to the garden of paradise.

Remember everywhere, everything is in this place,
Take a place if you found a place to take,
And if you don't have anything nice to say,
You can tell it while you take it to your grave, wake me up when I'm on the throw to paradise,
Lift me off the ground and take me to the garden of paradise.

I left alone, I left the world I was running,
To be by your side I was dying, alone by your side I was flying.
I came alone, I've come a long way to get here, the leaves they fall to my feet,at home,they mean nothing to me.
