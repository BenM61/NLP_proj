He's always laughing and flirting with me
And you act like you don't even care
As a matter of fact you've been real distant lately
Acting like I'm not even there

He says that you don't deserve a girl like me
I'm starting to think that he's right, baby

If you let him take me from you
I guess I'll finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves
That your love was never true
If you let him take me from you, baby
If you let him take me from you

Why is it that when we go out, out together as one big crew
I try to chill with you, dance, or whatever
And your homeboy's more interested than you

He pays more attention to me than you lately
I'm tempted to pay attention too, baby

If you let him take me from you
I guess I'll finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves
That your love was never true
If you let him take me from you, baby
If you let him take me from you

Boy, when I try to show some affection to you
You act like you got better things to do
When you want some loving, that's when it's cool
But, baby boy, I'm not a fool

If you let him take me from you
I guess I'll finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves
That your love was never true
If you let him take me from you, baby (how could you let him take your woman)
If you let him take me from you (are you gonna let him take me from you)

If you let him take me from you
I guess I'll finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves (just let me go)
That your love was never true (let me go)
If you let him take me from you, baby (just let me know)
If you let him take me from you
If you let him take me from you
