I met a girl once, I thought she was the one for me
I was so taken by her personality
I met a girl once, who took my heart and love away
She looked an angel vision walking through the day

I took her to parties, bought her everything I could
I treated her just like a queen
I told her I loved her, marry her I said I would
Didn't realize just what a fool I've been

I met a girl once, she did me wrong behind the back
Then when I've found out I felt like my heart would crack
I met a girl once, she taught me what I had to learn
That if love's cruel, broken hearts are what you learn

I took her to parties, bought her everything I could

Then when I've found out I felt like my heart would crack
I met a girl, once, she taught me what I had to learn
