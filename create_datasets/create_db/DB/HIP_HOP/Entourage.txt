Girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl,
All I can say is...
Girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl

Let's go!
I don't need nobody else around, see
Love the way ya compliment my style
Though you may end up bein' my only girl
'cause when you're with me, you're my whole world
Like when, it's just me n' you, ha'
Vibe is crazy between us two
You're my homie, my lover indeed you're my friend
Now I said this before ima say it again

Now here is the situation
I like what we've got happen'
And I don't want nothing comin' in between both me n' you
I'll let you be lieutenant, if you let me be captain
Tell me if that's cool

Baby I want you to be my entourage
(super fly chick)
You could be my personal superstar
(super fly chick)
Baby I want you to be my entourage
(super fly chick)
If you want then we could take this very far
(super fly chick)

You're a star in your own right
At times you steal the whole spotlight
I don't mind girl you're fine, put a smile on my face
Besides who want a chick that no dude would chase
Sometimes I know you're unsure
Wonder if this will endure
Don't make me make a promise that I can't keep
'cause it's cool how it is let's not complicate things girl

now here is the situation
I like what we've got happen'
And I don't want nothing comin' in between both me n' you
