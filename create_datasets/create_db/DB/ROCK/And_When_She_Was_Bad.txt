I'm not denying that I was trying to appear nonchalant
You're not my wife; it's your own life and you can kiss who you want
But that kiss lasted slightly longer than strictly was right
You say you tried to break off but he was stronger
Well maybe you might
Not be quite as blame free as your expression suggests
If he's only an old buddy why does he stare at your breasts?
And is he always quite so zealous about keeping in touch?
I don't usually get this jealous, but that was too much
Please don't tease
Just stay away from him from today
I mean it, I've seen it
You say it's all just for fun, but look what you've done
Listen, babe, he was already trying to get his hand down your shirt!
From what you're saying (well, unless you're lying!) he's going to get hurt
Please don't tease
Just stay away from him from today
I mean it, I've seen it
You say it's all just for fun, but look what you've done
