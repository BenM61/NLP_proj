Every time I look in the mirror
All these lines on my face getting clearer
The past is gone
It went by, like dusk to dawn
Isn't that the way
Everybody's got their dues in life to pay

I know it's everybody's sin
You got to lose to know how to win yeah

Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good lord will take you away

Oh

Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

Dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream until your dreams come true
Dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream until your dream comes through
Dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on

Every time I look in the mirror
The past is gone
