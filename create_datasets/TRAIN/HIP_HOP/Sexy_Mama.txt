(Verse1:)
You're a queen, and you deserve to sit upon a throne,
With me, You'd never be alone!
Cause I'm a king, 2 castles and a kingdoms what I'd bring,
To you, if you dance with me tonite.

Sexy mama, oh sexy mama, girl cut the drama
I know you wanna dance with me
Sexy mama, oh sexy mama, girl cut the drama
Come and take a chance with me tonite

(Verse2:)
Teri, ta meri bas, ik jindari hoye (You and I are meant for each other)
Aakh naal aakh miljawe, ahiyo hi duah hoye (Our eyes meet, that's my prayer)
We tu mere kol aaja, dil di pukar hove (Come close to me, my hearts passion)
We tu sade naal aaja, dil di ayho chah hove. (Come with me, that's my hearts desire)
