Is there something that you are trying to say 
Don't hold back now 
It's been a long time since I felt this way 
So don't hold back now 

I purposely forgot about 
Loving anyone 
Cause I'm the only one who has 
Who has been stepped upon 

Is there something that you are trying to say 
Cause I can take it 
Cause I grew up a man this way 
And if I'm hurt I'll shake it 

I'll crawl back into my cave 
That's how I'll make it 
Cause out of all this hurt we have 
Beauty thus become 
Beauty thus become 

In the mourning I can see the sights 
No wonder I could never keep you satisfied 
In the mourning I can see inside 
Myself and all the things that you were trying to hide 

Wishing all the best for you 
And now I will say goodbye 
Cause all the shit that we've been through 
Put wisdom in my eyes 

So walk away, don't turn around 
Cause I won't be standing here 
Cause all the lies that I've been living through 
Are becoming very clear 
And beauty thus become 

In the mourning I can see the sights 
No wonder I could never keep you satisfied 
In the mourning I can see inside 
Myself and all the things that you were trying to hide 

Then you conned me into thinking 
That all I had was you 
The small insinuations 
Were cutting me through 
Cutting me through 

And now I stand alone here 
Stronger than before 
And I'll never go back 
Never go back 
Never go 

In the mourning I can see the sights 
No wonder I could never keep you satisfied 
In the mourning I can see inside 
Myself and all the things that you were trying to hide
