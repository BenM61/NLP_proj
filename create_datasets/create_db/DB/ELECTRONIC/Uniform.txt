Well you want to be in the gang
And you've got, got to join the team
To be on the team, you must play to win
You play to win, you may not make it home

Up the hill, down again
You're the one, you're the one
Everybody wears the badge
Uniform, uniform

Soldier boys! We've got plans for you
A brand new game, we call it "mass control"
When you grow up, it's not so obvious
Dirt on your face, holding your broken toys

Up the hill, down again
You're the one, you're the one
Everybody wears the badge
Uniform, uniform

Up the hill, down again
You're the one, you're the one
Everybody wears the badge
Uniform, uniform
Up the hill, down again
You're the one, you're the one
Everybody wears the badge
Uniform, uniform

Uniform
Uniform
Uniform
