Lines and lines of the spines, colored everyone
Down the aisles, along the titles
Where you run your eyes
Read a few lines, ah

Read the sign above the door
It's not for everyone

Makes you feel, individual
Pages are one but that you ignore, ah

Read the sign above the door
You'll run like anyone

Down the aisles, along the titles
Where you run your eyes
Read a few lines, ah

Read the sign above the door
It's not for everyone
