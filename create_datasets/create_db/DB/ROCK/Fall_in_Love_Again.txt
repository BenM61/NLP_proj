Lookin' for a brighter tomorrow
Hopin' that the wind and rain is clear
Layin' down by the river
Wearin' out my old blue jeans

So many things have come between us
Gotta stand up and move around

I just wanna fall in love again
I don't want our dreams to ever end
I just wanna fall in love again
Ah, with you

I still love to go to the river
Ah, just to wash my blues away
And the wind is still blowin'
But without you even the rain don't feel the same

I can see through the tears in your eyes
I don't wanna live on a memory

I just wanna fall in love again
I don't want our dreams to ever end
I just wanna fall in love again
Ah, with you, ah let me tell you baby

All alone at night with everything you need
Reflections in the mirror is all you really see
You're just someone else and I, and I can't live on a memory

I just wanna fall in love again
I don't want our dreams to ever end
Say you wanna fall in love again
Ah, baby, with you, with you
I wanna fall in love again
Ooh, ooh

I wanna fall in, in love again
Ah, baby, with you, with you
I wanna fall in love again with you, with you
I wanna fall in love again
I just wanna fall in love again
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ah, with you
