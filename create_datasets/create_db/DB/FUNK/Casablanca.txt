Meeting in a jungle of a hundred burning suns
We couldn't hide, we couldn't run
Inner city art mirages, you never know who to trust
This isn't fantasy, this is us 

Oh Casablanca, you were my island
Lost in the middle of an ocean of sand
We were actors in their dreams, ain't it true, baby
Oh Casablanca, you were my island
Lost in the middle of an ocean of sand

We had everybody's eyes upon us
We're the fundamental things of life
We're the strangers as time goes by

Sound stage 7, you'd pretend you're not there
Cameras are rolling, make believe you don't care
We were actors in their dreams, ain't it true, baby

Oh Casablanca, you were my island
Lost in the middle of an ocean of sand
Oh Casablanca, you'll never change
Oh Casablanca, you'll never change
