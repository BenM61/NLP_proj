We were born to go, we're never turning back
We were born to go, and leave a burning track
We were born to go, and leave no star unturned
We were born to grow, we were born to learn
We're breaking out of the shell, we're breaking free
We're hatching our dreams into reality
We were born to blaze a new clear way through space
A way out of the maze, that held the human race
We were born to go, as far as we can find
We were born to go, to blow the human mind
