Every night my dream's the same
Same old city with a different name
They're not coming to take me away
I don't know why, but I know I can't stay

There's a weight that's pressing down
Late at night you can hear the sound
Even the noise you make when you sleep
Can't swim across a river so deep

They know my name because I told it to them
But they don't know where, and they don't know when
It's coming
When it's coming

There's this fear I keep so deep
Knew it's name since before I could speak
Oh, oh, oh, oh

They know my name because I told it to them
But they don't know where, and they don't know when
It's coming or when
But it's coming; keep the car running

If some night I don't come home
Please don't think I've left you alone
The same place that I must go when they die
You can't climb across a mountain so high
The same city where I go when I sleep
Can't swim across a river so deep

They know my name because I told it to them
But they don't know where, and they don't know when
It's coming or when
Is it's coming?
Keep the car running
Keep the car running
Keep the car running
