Your secret's safe here
It'll never leave
It's in the basement for ya, na'mean
Won't seek replacements
My ballerina
There's many faces in my gallery

Ella, I don't know what week it's under
Ella, it gets old, it gets old
Ella, teletext or you can call me
Galavanting heart
I don't know what week it's under

Your secret's safe here
It'll never leave
It's in the basement for ya

Ella, I don't know what week it's under
Ella, go and talk to Steve about it
Galavanting heart
I don't know what week it's under
Ella, it gets old, it gets old

(Don't need replacement)
(Your secret's safe here)
