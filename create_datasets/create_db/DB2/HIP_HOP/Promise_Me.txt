All of my life it seemed I waited for this day
All this time I was searching cause I never knew 
You could make me feel this way
So much love 

You captured my heart and my soul
And baby I'm loosing control I don't ever want to let go
Of what you give me

Promise you'll never leave me
Promise you'll always stay
Promise you'll never run away from a love
Promise me, promise me

If you could grantee that what you say is true
Everyday you're my life ill be there threw the night
And I give my self to you
So much love 
I cherish the moments we share
The feelings that won't disappear 
The magic you bring when you're near
So take that from me

Promise you'll never leave me
Promise you'll always stay
Promise you'll never run away from a love
Promise me, promise me

Promise you'll never leave me
Promise you'll always stay
Promise you'll never run away from a love
Promise me, promise me
