Against the grain am I living again
In a ray of light
Waiting and waiting for the floods to come
Fire flies into my eyes
As I follow the sun
Where to now where will we go

Fa fa fa
And I believed you
But you deceived me
In an hour in a minute in a second I hope
The floods will come

Magnificent is disarray
Watch me tumbling down
Waiting and waiting for the floods to come
Walk away fist in the air feet on the ground
Tell me oh tell me
Where is it to be this time

Fa ...
The floods will not come
Should have known better
