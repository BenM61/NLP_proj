There's a sadness all around us
There are words we're too afraid to say
The things that I thought would last forever
Are changing every day
There's a hunger that can't be satisfied
And the streets are filled with rage
It's time to dig deep inside ourselves
And face the life we've made

It's gonna take the two of us
I just can't do it all on my own
I see the day gettin' brighter
Hold me a little bit tighter

Out of the darkness and hand in hand
Baby together we will make our stand
Reach out and touch me we can win somehow
I know there's nothin' that can stop us now
Oh baby, come with me out of the darkness

I've lived my life trapped with trouble
Now it's time to make a new start
I thought the only justice in this world
Came from an angry heart
Now I know there's got to be love to protect us
But we can't wait for it to come
I know there's more to life than black and white
The sooner we learn, the sooner we've won

It's gonna take the two of us
I just can't make it all on my own
If you are a fighter
Hold me a little bit tighter
