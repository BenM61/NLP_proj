All work and no play makes me a dull boy
All work and no play makes me a dull boy
All work and no play makes me a dull boy
All work and no play makes me a dull boy

Live in a secret
Live in a lie
Live in a dark hole beneath the black sky
Live like a martyr and draw my last breath
Feel like an old man with a knife in my chest

Live like a transient
Live like a thief
Hide in a closet, grinding my teeth
Sit in a small room with the walls closing in
Open the shutters but everything's still dim

Payback
For all the things
I've done in my past

Payback
For everything
There are no take backs

All work and no play makes me a dull boy

I'm not the reason
Its not my fault
Its not my problem
I'm not the cause

I'm not your scapegoat
I'm not your god
I'm not your martyr
I'd leave you all

I'm not the reason - (I'm not your scapegoat)
Its not my fault - (I'm not your god)
Its not my problem - (I'm not your martyr)
I'm not the cause - (Id leave you all)

All work and no play makes me a dull boy

Feel like a clown without my funny nose
Walk to the window break it out with my fist
Jump from the sill and I'll plunge to my death
You can me selfish whatever ya think
Throw back my pills and take a sip of my drink

Walk beneath the clouds
Walk beneath the trees
Always again envy covering me

Payback
For all the things
I've done in my past

All work and no play makes me a dull boy

Sunshine's gone
Its all gone

By the way just so you know
Always this is how I feel

By the way just so you know
Always everyday this is how I feel

I'm not the reason
Its not my fault
Its not my problem
I'm not the cause
I'm not your scape goat (I'm not your scape goat)
I'm not your god (I'm not your god)
I'm not your martyr (I'm not your martyr)

This is how I feel (this is how I feel)

By the way just so you know
Always everyday this is how I feel
