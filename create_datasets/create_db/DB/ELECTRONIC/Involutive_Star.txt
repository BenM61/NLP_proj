Involutive star, you're shining
Like a fire on the sea
The crowning of the infant queen
And the beast is on its knees

You're living in a Christmas song
That will never last too long
The chimes are ringing through the night
And the word has become light
My love

Involutive star, you're shining
Like a diamond on the breeze
The way you walk and the way you talk
Like in a slow-mo silent film

You're living in a winter song
That keeps the world from turning on
The chimes are ringing through the dawn
And the sun will never come

Involutive star, you're drifting
Through the city's combat zone
Bullets whiz through your sheltered life
And they freeze right at your throne

Involutive star, have your fun with me
Then we'll get back to the sea
Involutive star, dress in lights for me
For the dark is running free
My love

Involutive star, you're calling
Like a banshee on the wind
For the walls of sound are closing on
With the coming of the spring

You're living in a winter song
That keeps the world from turning on
But they're shutting off the world today
And there's still the bill to pay

Involutive star, have your fun with me
Involutive star, dress in lights for me
Involutive star, have your fun with me
Involutive star, dress in lights for me

Involutive star, have your fun with me
Involutive star, dress in lights for me
Involutive star, have some fun with me
Involutive star, dress in lights for me
