Uhh
Down in New Orleans
Where the blues was born
It takes a cool cat to blow a horn
On LaSalle and Rampart Street
The combo's there with a mambo beat

The Mardi Gras mambo, mambo, mambo
Party Gras mambo, mambo, mambo
Mardi Gras mambo, ooh
Down in New Orleans

In Gert Town where the cats all meet
There's a Mardi Gras mambo with a beat
Join the Chief with the Zulu gang
And truck on down where the mambo's swing

The Mardi Gras mambo, mambo, mambo
Party Gras mambo, mambo, mambo
Mardi Gras mambo, ooh
Down in New Orleans

Down in New Orleans
Where the blues was born
It takes a cool cat to blow a horn
On LaSalle and Rampart Street
The combo's there with a mambo beat

The Mardi Gras mambo, mambo, mambo
Party Gras mambo, mambo, mambo
Party Gras mambo, ooh
Down in New Orleans

Mardi Gras mambo, mambo, mambo
Party Gras mambo, mambo, mambo
Mardi Gras mambo, mambo, mambo
Mardi Gras mambo, mambo, mambo
