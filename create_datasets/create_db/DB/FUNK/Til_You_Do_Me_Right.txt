I was in love with you, and gave my heart to  you
I did my best to keep you satisfied
You took the love from me, and used it selfishly
You did not give back your love to me at all

I gave the sun to you, you said it was too bright
I gave you diamond rings, you said they didn't shine
I gave my world to you, you said it's not enough
What in the world could I have done
To make you be so rough

'Til you do me right
I don't even want to talk to you
I don't even want to hear you speak my name
'Til you do me right
Only wrong is gonna come to you
Nothing good is gonna come to you
'Til you change your ways
Until you change your evil ways

Girl I was there for you, someone you could talk to
How could you just keep breaking my heart
What did I do to you, to make you be so cruel
I don't understand why you been so wronged

I tried to be your strength, you said I was too strong
I tried to compromise, so we could get along
I gave my love to you, despite your evil ways
I guess it's clear to me
There's only one thing left to say

'Til you do me right
I don't even want to talk to you
I don't even want to hear you speak my name
'Til you do me right
Only wrong is gonna come to you
Nothing good is gonna come to you
'Til you change your ways
Until you change your evil ways

There's a time when you know
What you feel inside your heart
It's telling you that something is strange
You don't have to deny it
All you gotta do is just try it
You'll find a love grows stronger
When your willing to change

'Til you do me right
I don't even want to talk to you
I don't even want to hear you speak my name
'Til you do me right
Only wrong is gonna come to you
Nothing good is gonna come to you
'Til you change your ways
Until you change your evil ways
