Who shot the bullet
That killed the air tonight
Without a thought, without a reason

Take a gun called hate
Up against your heart
And pull the trigger
And pull the trigger

It's over, it's only over
It's only over when we say

The smoke and mirrors
The lies that wind your tongue
Is this oppression what we wanted?
Or what we needed?
As we function on impatience
And our patience is wearing thin
And you live a lie that will destroy us all

It's over, it's only over
It's only over when we say 
It's only over when we say 

Back and to the left, 
Come on and shoot motherfucker

You like this baby?
Just dance a little longer

It's over, it's only over
It's only over when we say 
It's only over when we say
