I've seen the carnage that you've caused,
Smelt the power you've absorbed.
Been a witness to every crime,
And I'm dissatisfied all the time.
I wonder how you can sleep at night,
You're slumping to an all new record height.
You won't be forgotten for a long time,
You had your pound of flesh now Iwant mine.

We've got a hero,
We have a laugh.
He wears a yellow tartan scarf, a sense of humour.
He's a real star see Rupert in a fridge too far.

Contempt for wealth is all you breed,
Construct a conscience for all your greed.
Your restrictions they cut me deep,
And when you demise, I will not weep.
But life goes on they can't touch your mind,
You're the scourge of all mankind.
Now I ain't no portrait, I don't fly no flag,
You're the ambassador of hate, a diplomatic bag

Slap on the sanctions,
Show us some grit.
You've built your fence, now sit on it.
I hope all your dreams, go up in smoke,
'Cause he who laughs last, didn't get the joke.
