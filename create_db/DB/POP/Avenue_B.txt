Rapper standing on the corner 
Wrappers flying in the wind 
Waitress up from Alabama 
Can't believe the cold she's in 
And me, I'm sitting in my castle 
On the verge of a divorce 

And if I haven't got a hassle 
I'll create my own, of course 
Still I gotta live with my feelings 
But I know about science too 
And fame and death and money 
And what they do to you 

And I am gonna need a miracle 
I am gonna need a miracle 
I am gonna need a miracle 
Tonight on Avenue B 

I bought about a hundred candles 
I'm burnin' em both night and day 
I'm sleepin' when I should be eatin' 
Cryin' when I should be gay 
My girlfriend's warm and loves me 
She's knockin' but she can't get in 
I'm a product of the paranoia 
Of the age I'm in 

And I am gonna need a miracle 
I'm really gonna need a miracle 
I'm really gonna need a miracle 
Tonight on Avenue B 

I see the students out my window 
They're walking in their student clothes 
Eatin' books and information 
To make their understanding grow 
But this much I understand 
It's hard to be an empty man 
But since I gave `em every part of me 
I ain't free 

And I am gonna need a miracle 
I am gonna need a miracle 
I am gonna need a miracle 
Tonight on Avenue B 

I am gonna need a miracle 
I am gonna need a miracle 
I am gonna need a miracle 
Tonight on Avenue B
