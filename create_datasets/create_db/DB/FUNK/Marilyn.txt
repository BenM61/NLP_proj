See your face and I touch you, black and white
You're a silver screen, place your boundary
On a move in the dark, play the part
Put your star in me, place your boundary

Holding you, I'm touching a star
Turn it into Marilyn, leaning out every big car
Holding you, I'm touching a star
Stay the night, if you're thinking of, thinking out what you're good for

See your face at night, in forever light
You're a silver beam, place your boundary
On a move in the dark, play the part
Put your star in me, place your boundary

Holding you, I'm touching a star
Turn it into Marilyn, leaning out every big car
Holding you, I'm touching a star
Stay the night, if you're thinking of, thinking out what you're good for
