Everyday, everyday, everyday I have the blues
Everyday, everyday I have the blues
Because of you, darling
It's you, I hate to lose

Nobody loves me, nobody don't care
I don't believe they love me, nobody seems to care
Bad luck trouble, baby
I've had my share

I'm gonna pack my suitcase
Move on down the line
Get my grip, my shoes and my hat
And move on down the line
Everybody stand and shouting
Ain't nobody crying

I said, everyday, everyday I have the blues
Oh baby, night and day, I have the blues
Because it's you, nobody else
I hate to lose

Everyday I have the blues
Hit me now, I got the blues
Yes, you little girl
I hate to

Gonna pack up, get my grip, hat and move
Oh darling yeah
Grab my hat, my grip, my shoes and go on
On down the line
Ain't nobody worrying, everybody shouting
They should be crying, they should be

Everyday, everyday I have the blues
Everyday I have the blues
Yes, you little girl
I hate to, come on, come on
