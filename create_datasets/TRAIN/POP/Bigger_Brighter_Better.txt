Chevrolet over Pontchartrain
Blue and grey driving rain became a part of me
Search and play once again
Naive melody touched the heart of me
Brave words in bold relief
No time to get old, no belief

Bigger, brighter is how the world looked to me
But filled with my face staring straight back through me
Bigger, brighter, better and I was sold forever
Down no great river just an endless sea

A love supreme, one hell of a team
No messy birth or dirty death just the in between
Holding tight to what we thought was right
But begin to squeeze and love leaves
Boy, where you been

Yeah, I was young chewing gum acting like a dumb-dumb
All at sea woe is me let's get numb
Fast times, high hopes
Too whacked to push back the envelope

Bigger, brighter is how the world looked to me
But filled with your face staring straight back through me
Bigger, brighter, better and I was sold forever
Down no great river just an endless sea

You and I sail on stormy waters unaware of what we've got
Some say, ";Let it go, ride the tide feel the flow";
I sense bombs below
Can't wait to detonate them
You and I like a minesweeper

Lover, it's over and we can live more truly
See bridges burning over salted water
Lover, leave me and bring the world back to me
Bigger, brighter, better for your own sweet self
