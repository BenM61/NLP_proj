Currency carry me everyone is held hostage
Currency means nothing
How are they to spend us next
Do you want a stake in us?
How you have a stake in us

One day it'll all be over
One day it'll all be gone

I can see born asleep all these things in motion ours
All the debt and lives you've sold
There's no truth in who we trust
Print and print the money that you spend
Spend and spend the money that you print then

One day it'll all be over
One day it'll all be gone

I can see currency how it always sanctions us
All these paper lives you've sold
There's no God in who you trust
Print and print the money that you spend
Spend and spend the money that you print
Print and print the money that you spend
Spend and spend the money that you print then

One day it'll all be over one day it'll all be gone
And you will all be gone one day
Yeah you will all be gone one day

You've paid with your life
A slave from nine to five
You're spent through us
You take from us when we die
So claim the diamonds in your eyes
