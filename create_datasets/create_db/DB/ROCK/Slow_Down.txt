Come on pretty baby won't you walk with me
Come on pretty baby won't you talk with me
Come on pretty baby give me one more chance
Try to save our romance

- Slow down -
Baby now you're movin' way too fast
You gotta gimme little lovin'
Gimme a little lovin' - Ow!
If you want our love to last

Well I used to walk you home baby after school
Carry your books home too
But now you got the boyfriend down the street
Baby what you tryin' to do?

Better slow down -
Baby now you're movin' way too fast
You gotta gimme little lovin'
Gimme a little lovin' - Brrrr!
If you want our love to last

Well - you know that I love you tell the world I do
Come on pretty baby why can't you be true
I need your lovin' baby oh so bad
The best little woman that a man ever had

Slow down!
