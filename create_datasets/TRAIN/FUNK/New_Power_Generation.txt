Lay down your funky weapon.
Yeah y'all, here we go
Pumpin' the big noise in the 90's.

Pardon me for living, but this is my world to
I can't help that what's cool to us might be strange to you
Pardon me for breathing, can we borrow some of your air?
The problem with you and your kind is that you don't know love is there

Lay down your funky weapon, come join us on the floor
Making love and music's the only things worth fighting for
We are the new power generation, we want to change the world.
The only thing that's in our way is you.
Your old fashioned music, your old ideas,
We're sick and tired of you telling us what to do.

Pardon me for thinking, but there's something under my hair
I bet you thought the lights were on but no one's living there
You think that if you tell enough lies they will see the truth?
I hope they bury your old ideas the same time they bury you

Lay down your funky weapon, come join us on the floor
Making love and music's the only things worth fighting for
We are the new power generation, we want to change the world.
The only thing that's in our way is you.
Your old fashioned music, your old ideas,
We're sick and tired of you telling us what to do.

We are the new, We are the new, We are the new,
Making love and music
New power, we stand

Pardon us for caring, we didn't know it was against the rules (shout it out)
If we only want to love one another
Then tell me now who's the fool (tell me, tell me)
No father, no mother, no sister, no brother, nobody can make me stop
Said if you didn't come to party child, I think you better get up off of my block.

Lay down your funky weapon, come join us on the floor
Making love and music's the only things worth fighting for
We are the new power generation, we want to change the world.
The only thing that's in our way is you.
Your old fashioned music, your old ideas,
We're sick and tired of you telling us what to do.

Why don't you just be happy, baby.

Lay down your funky weapon, come join us on the floor
Making love and music's the only things worth fighting for
We are the new power generation, we want to change the world.
The only thing that's in our way is you.
Your old fashioned music, your old ideas,
We're sick and tired of you telling us what to do.

Go on and get up off of my block
Get up off of my block, because
Love is there if you'd just open up to it.
If you'd just believe your whole world would change

New power generation, you've got to rearrange. We've got
We are the new power generation, you've gotta give up all the fight
We gotta try to love one another, baby. we are the new power generation
We are the new power generation.
We are the new power generation.
