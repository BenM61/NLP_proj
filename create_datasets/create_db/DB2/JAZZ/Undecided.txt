First you say you will
And then you won't
And then you say you do
And then you don't
You're undecided now
So what are you gonna do?

First you want to play
And then it's no
And when you say you'll stay
That's when you go
You're undecided now
So what are you gonna do?

I've been sitting on a fence
And it doesn't make much sense
You keep me in suspense
And you know it
Then you promise to return
When you don't
I really burn
I guess I'll never learn
And I show it

If you've got a heart
And if you're kind
Then don't keep us apart
Make up your mind
You're undecided now
So what are you gonna do?
