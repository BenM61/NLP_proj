Shame, shame on you
Shame, shame on you
Gave my heart as a token
When returned, it was broken
Hide your face
Shame on you

Shame, shame on you
Shame, shame on you
Took my car and my money
Done me wrong and that ain't funny
Woe is me
Shame on you

Shame, shame on you
Shame, shame on you
Two can play your little game
You'll find out who was to blame
Durn your hide
Shame on you

Shame, shame on you
Shame, shame on you
Ran around with other guys
Tried to lie when I got wise
Foolish girl
Shame on you

Shame, shame on you
Shame, shame on you
Can you hold your head up high
Look your friends right in the eye
No you can't
Shame on you

Oh, Lady! Shame on you
