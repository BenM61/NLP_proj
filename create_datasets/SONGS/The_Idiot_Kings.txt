Everything is going up.
Everything is going as planned, yeah.
Everything moves along.
Everything is fine, fine, fine.

Oh I could be
Condemned to Hell for every sin but littering.
I could
Slip on the East River and crash into Queens all skittering.
I've seen the
Cops and the robbers, and I know they dance the same.
I've seen a
Half a zillion girls and haven't spoken to a single one of them.

Batting in the light,
My reptile-lidded eyes.
And all this strung end to end,
Is wider than the mind.

And this cool I've been playing I have been
Playing too long now my
Capacities are dwindling 'til they're
Gone Gone Gone.

Baby can I change my mind?
I just want to change my mind.
