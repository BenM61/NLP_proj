I swear I solve your life, my feet fall over you inside
And I thought I heard someone say, "Fly far away"
And when you reach up, the sky, I stay
This clueless, I wouldn't know, 
We swam in the waves and let it go
Until I heard someone say, "Rise and beyond"
Where you're reaching, knocked over stars

I dreamt I came from parking movements
Every moment I see with our clothes
Take me to places where we can stop
I dreamt I came from parking movements

Nothing can steal this treasure from us, babe
I'm still in love now, fighting the suns
Thank justice and come closer to me, babe
I'm falling out now

I dreamt I came from parking movements
Every moment I see with our clothes
Take me to places where we can stop
I dreamt I came from parking movements

Thank justice and come closer to me, 
Babe, I'm falling out
