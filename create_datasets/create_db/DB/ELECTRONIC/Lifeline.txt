Freeze frame on me
Hm, can you read it on my face?
Data mining from old memories

Hm, sunflowers and a smile catching
Hm, welcoming a heartbeat to the family
Light tie lanterns, wish bound in the night

Who, what, when?
All in one stir of a teaspoon
I'm shaken and gasping for air

Lifeline, before and after
In an instant of great white gravity (gravity)
Hold tight, 'cause all is against me
Every cell in my body, brace,
Woah, and keep breathing,
And keep breathing

Gracious future,
Hm, won't you lend a hand to pull me through?
'Cause me and you've got some things we need to see to
(Let's get to work, let's get to work)

Adventures in the multi-verse
Effervescent candlelit closeness
Plus, I feel like I've just got the hang of this living thing

Who, what, when?
All in one stir of a teaspoon
I'm shaken and gasping for air, air, air, air

I will, on one day,
And sometime, in some place,
I've still got some go in me yet

Lifeline, before and after
In an instant of great white gravity (gravity)
Hold tight, 'cause all is against me
Every cell in my body, brace (in my body, brace)

Rise high, cling to the laughters
For that moment of broken tragedy (tragedy)
Bright-eyed, the world is against me
Every cell in my body, brace,
Woah and keep breathing,
Keep breathing,
Still breathing

My bones stay strong,
My days, still long,
My heart has many heartbeats,
And home is where love is

Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah

Lifeline, before and after
In an instant of great white gravity
Hold tight, 'cause all is against me
Every cell in my body, brace

Rise high, cling to the laughters
For that moment of broken tragedy
Bright-eyed, the world is against me
Every cell in my body, brace,

And keep breathing
Keep breathing
And keep breathing
Keep breathing
And keep breathing, ah
Keep
