You and me we had a love that was forever
That's what I thought and I can still remember
Words you said, you said we'd always be together
Then why am I alone tonight?

Somethin' changed now you just don't feel the same
I'll never understand

How can the same love
That made me so happy, make me so sad?
I don't understand

How could the same eyes
That used to be laughin', cry in the night?
It doesn't seem right at all

Rememberin' the nights we held onto each other
The times you told me, you'll never love another
Rememberin' when I was all you ever needed
Where are you when I need you now?

Summer days have left me standin' in the rain
Somebody tell me how

How can the same love
That made me so happy, make me so sad?
I don't understand

How could the same eyes
That used to be laughin', cry in the night?
It doesn't seem right at all

Was my heart so blind, I couldn't see?
Was I a fool to believe promises you made to me?
What went wrong, what went wrong?

How can the same love
That made me so happy, make me so sad?
I don't understand

How could the same eyes
That used to be laughin', cry in the night?
It doesn't seem right at all
It doesn't seem right at all
