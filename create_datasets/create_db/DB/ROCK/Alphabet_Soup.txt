I should have known
By the arc of the empty wine glass
I should have known
'Cause you step on, don't walk over cracks

Looking over my shoulder
To see you looking back over yours
But you were paying the ferryman
Even after Chris said don't

But you're not Maud Gonne
Not Maud Gonne
No you're not Maude Gonne

You're not Maud Gonne
But then again neither was she
The only one talking now
Is my alphabet soup

I'd say you'd like children
But you couldn't eat a whole one
The only one talking now
Is my alphabet soup
And he's on a loop

I should have known
But I only caught a glimpse
I should have known
It was a beautiful

Red wine soaked glimpse
I was other peoples' children
I could always be sent home
In front of someone else's

Blue screen
For someone else's show

What's that you're saying to me
Tomato coated spaghetti?

It's gonna be OK
