(Gotti)
Yo Boo, Irv Gotti
Black, and BJ outta
Wit the f*** up here man
shit done hit the fan
Let's do dis shit man
Fo' real

(Boo)
Let's do it
What the f***?
There ain't nothin'
Else to be said

(Gotti)
Yo, I got a empire with niggas
With thug in they blood
I admire them niggas
My desire is figgas

Rockland b****
Why hire some killas?
Gotti heat like hail son
And fire them niggas

Pop off 2 clips
Top off new six
Rock frost blue wrist
Still cop two bricks

Cook crack in the pot
Push pats on the block
Cock the glock
Pop up like jack in a box

He crazy insane
Mommys say loco
I even push 'caine
When the blow is slow

And when the dough got low
I got the high 'fo
Back in the same hood
On the block for 'mo

Doorags, saggin' pants
I'm baggin' grams
Niggas smokin' the joke
And then laughin' at

"What if I get to blast a man?"
Aw shit
Boo watch out
Oh shit, you capped
That nigga yo

(Boo)
You think I just got nice?
Well I been at niggas throats
'Til it even got worse
And I got hennessy

And coke in my system
Hot chicks
I f*** 'em and diss 'em
I'm out to cop bricks

Cut 'em and split 'em
Put plenty in the bag
20's on the jag
I'm a big faced getter

You get panties and brag
Fo Fo too heavy
So I'm bustin' the sag
Slow dough, that's petty

I ain't f***in' wit' that
It's fo real when
I spit these bars
And cats like

"Damn, How dis lil nigga
Get new cars?"
Stay high all day run around
With thugs flippin' pies all day

Rockland Nigga
So you better make way
'Cause we comin' for niggas
Got guns?

We ain't runnin' from niggas
I know you heard that

(Gotti)
My real b****es!
Sometimes
I'm less than a b****
Never trustin' a b****
I'd rather get head
Than be f***in' a b****

(Boo)
And it ain't nothin' different
That's the way we roll
It be them lame as* niggas
Givin' dough to h*es

(Gotti)
Before I pay for a brick
She taste da shit
Put her back on a bus
Wit it taped to her hips

(Boo)
All my mommys
Rock Gucci
If we in the whip
Put the dope in her coochie

(Gotti)
All my chicks like Snoopy
I like dykes that like dykes
But I don't like groupies
I use to like tootie
And that's a fact for ya life

(Boo)
I got chicks that smoke
Some roll dice
Others like to fight
But they all love ice

(Gotti)
Hip hop niggas
They all thugs right?
Nah, get dropped nigga
Netta get plugged right
Boo and Gotti true pimps
Rockland for life
Get it right

(Boo and Gotti)
Rockland

(Gotti)
For life nigga

(Boo and Gotti)
Boo and Gotti
