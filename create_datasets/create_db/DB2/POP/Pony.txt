When i grow up i want a pony
I'm gonna ride her from dust til dawn
I'm gonna brush her mane
And feed her sugar cane
And keep her in safe from the storm

If i had a pony
I wonder could i be your girl

When i grow up i want a baby
I'm gonna name it after Ralph Stanley
And I sure won't mind if it cries all night
Just as long as it looks like me

If i had a baby
I wonder could i be your girl

Yodelay he yodeloh oh
Your rock my world
Yodelay he yodeloh
When i grow up i wanna be your girl

When i grow up i want a cowboy
With dust all over his jeans
With a horse named Jack
And a ten-gallon hat
He is nice but looks so mean

If you were a cowboy
I wonder could i be your girl

Yodelay he yodeloh oh
Your rock my world
Yodelay he yodeloh
When i grow up i wanna be your girl

When i grow up I'll be a lady
All my rings will be made of gold
I'll put flowers in my room
I'll wear perfume

I won't listen to rock n roll
If i was a lady
I wonder could i be your girl

Yodelay he yodeloh oh
Your rock my world
Yodelay he yodeloh
When i grow up i wanna be your girl
