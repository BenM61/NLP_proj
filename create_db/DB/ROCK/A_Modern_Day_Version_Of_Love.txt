And the night was filled with laughter
Echoing through painted smiles
And I knew each morning after
I never loved, was never touched
Gave not at all, got back as much
In the comfort of
A modern day version of love

Truly, how I've cursed the sweet taste
Of lips that ask so-o much of me
Still I wonder with every embrace
Could I give, and not break
Should I care, and forsake
All the comfort of
A modern day version of love

Close my eyes and keep on runnin'
Realize it isn't gonna work anymore
For me, yeah
I'm afraid, well maybe that's somethin'
Never cared enough to be afraid of anything
Before, not before

Baffled child on streets of sinner
Sleeping child, a morning call
Playful spring, look face the winter
Take thy hand, taste the kiss
Leave behind, emptiness
And the comfort of
A modern day version of love
