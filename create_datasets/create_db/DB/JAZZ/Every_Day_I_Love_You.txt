Ev'ryday I love you just a little bit more,
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more'
Ev'ryday I want you just a little bit more 
Than I did the day before,

You'll never guess how deep my love is'
Not even in your wildest dream,
But just so you'll get it clear;
Compared to my love, my dear,

The Mississippi River's just a stream,
Ev'ryday I love you just a little bit more,
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more;
Ev'ryday I want you just a little bit more,

Than I did the day before
