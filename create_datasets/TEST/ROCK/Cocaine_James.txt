The life of the party
Just stained the sheets
The life of the party
With yellow teeth
The life of the party
Hasn't slept in a week
And it's starting to show.
No need to worry
I'm on board again
No need to worry.
Stay looking thin.
No need to worry.
Gave up on eating
And it's starting to show.
You're singing along, singing along, singing along.
And I'm not!
You're singing along, singing along, singing along.
I'm not!
(x2)
The life of the party
Is last to leave
The life of the party
Went down on three
The life of the party
Gave it out for free
And it's starting to show
You're singing along, singing along, singing along.
And I'm not!
You're singing along, singing along, singing along.
I'm not!
(x2)
Countdown to the cold war and we're at three
Countdown to the cold war and we're at two
Countdown to the cold war and we're all through
You're singing along, singing along, singing along.
And I'm not!
You're singing along, singing along, singing along.
I'm not!
(x2)
Watch as it starts to show
Watch as it starts to show
Watch as it starts to show
No, no, no
(x2)
