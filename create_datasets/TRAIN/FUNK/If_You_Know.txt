If you know
Please don't make another sound
Time is being cruel
And thieves and lovers drown

Vanity and fear
Make me talk this way
Vanity and fear
Make me talk this way
You are now free
To make another frown
As purity and love
Is pushed and shoved around

Shoved around
You will see irregular beauty
From the ground
Cause the waters cold
The soul's too hot to hold
Make no sound
Let the secret be
Between you and me
From the ground
You will see me there

If you know
Please don't make another sound
Time is being cruel
And thieves and lovers drown

Look around, look around,
Look around, look around
Look around, everyone knows
What's going on

Everyone knows, Everyone knows
Everyone knows, Everyone knows

You will see irregular beauty
From the ground
because the waters cold
The soul's too hot to hold
Make no sound
Let the secret be
Between you and me
From the ground
You will see me there

If you know
Please don't make another sound
Time is being cruel
And thieves and lovers drown

Everyone knows, Everyone knows
Everyone knows, Everyone knows
