I can't feel, you will stay
For a while until' the winds
Change again and take you away
But I won't taste a bitter tear

Cause the only thing you wanted
Is to hunt then not be hunted
Not to have, not to hold
Runnin' hot, turnin' cold and I know

Oh you'll go ahead and fly again
No one's gonna hold you back
Driven by your lonely heart
Tell me, can you love like that?

Oh just go ahead and fly again
No one's gonna hold you back
Driven by your lonely heart
Tell me can you love like that?
Tell me can you love like that, that, that?

The winds come back, stirs my soul
I'll take you in, you take control
Wide awake, you leave me haunted
Cause you want not to be wanted

Not to have not to hold
Can't pretend in the end, I still know

Oh, you'll go ahead and fly again
No one's gonna hold you back
Driven by your lonely heart
Tell me can you love like that?

Oh just go ahead and fly again
No one's gonna hold you back
Driven by your lonely heart
Tell me can you love like that?

Not to have, not to hold
Not to have, not to hold
Not to have, not to hold
Can't pretend in the end, I still know

Oh now go ahead and fly again
(No one's gonna hold you back)
No one's gonna hold you back
(Oh no no)
Driven by your lonely heart
(Tell me can you love like that?)
Tell me can you love like that?

Now go ahead and fly again
No one's gonna hold you back
Driven by your lonely heart
Tell me can you love like that?
Tell me can you love like that, that, that?
