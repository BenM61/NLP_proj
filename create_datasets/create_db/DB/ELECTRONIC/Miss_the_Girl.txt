Kiss the girl
Kiss the girl
Hand around the steering wheel
Caress the shiny vinyl feel

Don't you miss the girl?
Miss the girl
Seduced reflection in the chrome
There's petrol stains outside your home

Kiss the girl
Kiss the girl
Your loving strokes are fatal charms
Revenge bites back into her arms

You didn't miss the girl
You hit the girl
You hit her with a force of steel
She's wrapped around your burning wheels

Kiss the girl
Miss the girl
Kiss the girl
Miss the girl
