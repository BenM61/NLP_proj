I seen you darlin'
Seen you hangin' round town
You in a short skirt
Shinin' eyes of deep brown
You had a dirty look
You caught me on your hook
Turn up the thermostat
I wanna see you sweat

Ah yeah
Girl you've got something I
Like

I walked right over, said
Hi how you doin'
You smiled at me
And girl you tore right through me
I said Come on, let's dance
We've gotta take our chance
You whispered in my ear
You wanna get out of here

Can you feel it
Rockin' the city
Ah yeah
Straight out of nowhereness
Like a fist
Can't resist you oh no
I tell you something

You know I love ya
Just wanna touch ya
Stand up
Knock me right off my feet
Hard to beat, hard to beat
Hard to beat

Wooh, ah!

Let's spend the night
Spend the night together
Heart beatin' so fast
As you take my shirt off
This girl I saw round town
Well now she's goin' down
Stuck on a losing streak
I think you've turned me round

Ah yeah
Girl you've got something I
Like

Read all about it
Have you heard the latest
Boy in a band
Beef Hollywood actress
But baby you and me
We came up from the street
No time to hesitate
We gotta push our weight

Can you feel it
Rockin' the city
Ah yeah
Straight out of nowhereness
Like a fist
Can't resist you oh no
I tell you somethin'
You know I love ya
Just wanna touch ya
Stand up
Knock me right off my feet
Hard to beat, hard to beat
Hard to beat

Goodness
No I've never known a night like this
Can't believe it
You're so hard to beat
Hard to beat

Drive me crazy
My beautiful baby
Let's spend the whole day
Right here together
You know I love ya
Just wanna touch ya
Stand up
Knock me right off my feet
Hard to beat, hard to beat
Hard to beat

Ah yeah, girl you've got
Something I like
