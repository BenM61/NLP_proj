It's all right if you love me,
It's all right if you don't,
I'm not afraid of you running away honey,
I get the feeling you won't.

There's no sense in pretending,
(?)
Something inside you, is feeling like I do,
We've said all there is the say.

Breakdown, honey go ahead and give it to me,
Breakdown, honey take me tonight,
Breakdown, I'm standin' hear can't you see,
Breakdown, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right.

It's all right if you love me,
It's all right if you don't,
I'm not afraid of you running away honey,
I get the feeling you won't,

It's OK if you must go,
I'll understand if you don't,
You say goodbye right now,
I'll still survive somehow,
Why should we let this drag on?

Breakdown, honey go ahead and give it to me,
Breakdown, honey take me tonight,
Breakdown, I'm standin' hear can't you see,
Breakdown, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, baby.

Breakdown, honey go ahead and give it to me,
Breakdown, honey take me tonight,
Breakdown, I'm standin' hear can't you see,
Breakdown, it's all right, it's all right, 

Breakdown, honey go ahead and give it to me,
Breakdown, honey take me to the night,
Breakdown, I'm standin' hear can't you see,
Breakdown, it's all right, it's all right,
