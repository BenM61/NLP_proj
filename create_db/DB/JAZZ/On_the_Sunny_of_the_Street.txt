Grab your coat
Grab your hat, baby
Leave your worries on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
On the sunny side of the street

Can't you hear a pitter-pat, babe?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade, ba-ba-bo
But I'm not afraid, baby
My Rover's crossed over, ay

If I never have a cent, babe
I'd be rich as Rock-e-fellow
With gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street

Grab your coat
Get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep, ba-be-do
Just direct your feet
On the sunny side of the street, zay-zoo-za-ze-zo-zay

Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
Oh, the happy tune is your step, ba-be-oh
Life can be so sweet, oh, ba-be-bo-ba-bay
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
Baby, with those blues on parade
Oh, but I'm not afreaid, baby
My rover!
My rover crossed over!

And if I never have a cent
I'll be rich as Rock-e-fellow, hey
With gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
