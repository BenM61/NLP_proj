He's worth more
Than every star in the sky
With that look of forgiveness
That's always in his eyes

He works so hard
But gentle as a lamb
He gave up so much
To make me just what I am and, oh

Oh, let me be
The man my daddy was
Oh, let me be
The man my daddy was

When I was young
Sometimes foolishly I played
But he reached out and, oh
Showed me the way

Now he's only human
And bound to make mistakes
But it was all right
By the moment I would awake and, oh

Oh, let me be
The man my daddy was
Oh, let me be
The man my daddy was

Sometimes I hope
I don't live to see the day
When he reaches down
And take them both away

And look at my children
Sometimes foolishly they play
Let me live long enough
Let me show them the way

My clothes were sometimes untidy
And that bed was never made
But mom and dad would scold me good
Never doubted I've made the grade

But now that I'm a man
I ask the Lord up above
Please let me raise my children right
And be the man my daddy was and, oh

Oh, let me be
The man my daddy was
Oh, let me be
The man my daddy was

He was a good man
He was a poor man
Oh, let me be
