One thing that I just can't conceive
Is how to let you go.
And if you will stay with me
Then we will always know.

We will find out
As we change about.
Is this the last part?
Here is when we shout:

One thing that I just can't conceive
Is how to let you go.
These days await if we believe
I'll make it to the show.

We will find out
As we change about.
Is this the last part?
Here is when we shout:

And you could say, "give your love to me,"
But I was far away.
And you could be handing love to me,
But I was far away.
And you could say "bring your love to me,"
But I was far away.
And you could be handing love to me
But I was far away.

I've lost myself once and I see
That I was weak of heart.
And if you will stay with me
We face the hardest part.

We will find out
As we change about.
Is this the last part?
Here is one we shout:

And you could say, "give your love to me,"
But I was far away.
And you could be handing love to me,
But I was far away.
And you could say "bring your love to me",
That I was far away.
And you could be handing love to me,
But I was far away.

If you believe a hand on your sleeve
Can pull you over,
Because you know wherever you go
I'll be over your shoulder.

If you believe a hand on your faith
Can pull you over,
Because you know wherever you go
I'll be over your shoulder.

And you could say, "give your love to me,"
But I was far away.
And you could be handing love to me,
But I was far away
