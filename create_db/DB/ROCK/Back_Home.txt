Goin' back right through the city
through the country, rivers so pretty
People wonder why I'm going back home
Just the place where I belong
Back home, back home, back home, back home

Well I'm a round the world rambler
Just a fortune gambler
It's always good to be back home

'round and 'round, the world goes 'round
Got my friends in every town
From border to border, every place I've been
I've gotta be back if you know what I mean
Back home, back home, back home, back home

Well I'm a round the world rambler
Just a fortune gambler
It's always good to be back home
