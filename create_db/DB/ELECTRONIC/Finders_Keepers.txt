Finders keepers ooh
Listen, this is getting old
Being braver than you
Feels like I'm selling my soul

Name me then shame me
Take my pride ooh
You'll never win me over
I'm on my own side

Breaking ways, changing names
Crashing crystal ashtrays

I'm over today
I'm over you, I'm over yesterday
Even if tomorrow comes too soon

Baby break me yeah yeah
Take me, leave me, I don't care
You can't underestimate me
If only I could make you see

Spin my carousel for us
Take a look inside here
This is my personal circus
If only I could see this clear

Breaking ways, changing names
Crashing crystal ashtrays

I'm over today
I'm over you
I'm over yesterday
Even if tomorrow comes too soon

Finders keepers yeah yeah oh

Breaking ways, changing names
Crashing crystal ashtrays

I'm over today
I'm over you
I'm over yesterday
Even if tomorrow comes too soon
