It all comes back to me now, 
A starry summer sky,
A laughing you and I, alone.
It all comes back to me now, 
A sea of midnight blue,
Your face uplifted to my own.

We called it a thrill of the moment, 
And blamed the moon up above,
We didn't know what the glow meant,
We never dreamed it might be love.
It all comes back to me now, 
The love I threw away,
And now each lonely night I pray, 
That it will all come back to me someday.
