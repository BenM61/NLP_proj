I walk in a line
I see where I'm goin'
I turn inside out
The days that I've known

I face to myself
And give up the ghost
I turn in my mind
What time already knows

In the time of the assassins they say "Hallelujah"
It doesn't take a miracle to raise a heart from the dead

I sift through the ash
I look for a sign
I open the wound
That keeps me in line

The shoulder that turns
The flame that goes out
The chapter I close
There's no point to it now

In the time of the assassins they say "Hallelujah"
It doesn't take a miracle to raise a heart from the dead

And can something changed
And still feel the same
The beginning's the end
I start all over again

In the time of the assassins they say "Hallelujah"
It doesn't take a miracle to raise a heart from the dead
