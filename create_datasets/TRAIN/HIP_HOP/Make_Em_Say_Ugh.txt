(Mia X) 
We capitolize and monopolize on everything we see 
Keep pistols drawed and cocked 
We got the industry locked, we can't be stopped, too hot 
Check the spots that we got on billboards 
The tank can set up roadblocks, we fadin all you hoes 
Want some mo? 
Then let's go, stretch you out like elastic 
Zip that ass up in plastic, have ya folks pickin caskets 
We drastic, our tactics is homegrown in the ghetto 
So feel the wrath of this sista, it's like you fightin 10 niggas 
Forget the baby boys, it's the biggest mama Mia 
The unlady like diva, lyrical man eater, believe her 
Or see her, and get that ass embarrassed 
If you're a decision maker, guaranteed you'll get carried away 
So stay in yo place, when ya hear mamma speakin 
Cannons spray, clear the way, when ya see the tank creepin 
N nah n nah! (n nah n nah!)

We TRU soldiers, and we don't die 
We keep rollin, n-n-nah-nah-nah 
All aboard, it's like a band inside 
The group going hallelujah 
Niggas goin to war, got to fightin and shootin inside rumors 
Little bitch sayin he there, we there, be where?

Ain't no salary cap, on top of my dollars

I gets down nigga, I hold my tank up high 
Watch how many bitches get wild, n-nah-n-nah 
N nah n nah! (n nah n nah!)
