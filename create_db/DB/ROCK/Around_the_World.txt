All around the world
We could make timerompin' and a stompin'
'Cause I'm in my prime

Born in the north and sworn to entertain ya
'Cause I'm down for the state of Pennsylvania

I try not to whineut I must warn ya
'Bout the girls from California

Alabama baby said hallelujah
Good god girl I wish I knew ya

I know I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
I know I know it's you
You say hello and then I say I do

Come back baby 'cause I'd like to say
I've been around the world back from bombay

Fox hole love pie in your face
Living in and out of a big fat suitcase

Bonafide ride step aside my Johnson
Yes I could in the woods of Wisconsin

Wake up the cake it's a lake she's kissin' me
As they do when when they do in sicily

I know I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
I know I know it's you
You say hello and then I say I do

Where you want to go who you want to be
What you want to do just come with me

I saw god and I saw the fountains
You and me girl sittin' in the Swiss mountains

Me oh my o, me and guy o
Freer than a bird 'cause we're rockin' ohio

Around the world
I feel dutiful
Take a wife 'cause life is beautiful

I know I know for sure
Ding dang dong dong ding dang dong dong ding dang
I know I know its you
Ding dang dong dong ding dang dong dong ding dang

Mother Russia do not suffer
I know you're bold enough
I've been around the world And I have seen your love
I know I know it's you

You say hello then I say I do
