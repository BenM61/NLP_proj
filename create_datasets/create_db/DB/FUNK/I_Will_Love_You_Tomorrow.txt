I will love you tomorrow
I will love you all the way
I will love you tomorrow
If you'll just love me today

You're the one that I've been dreaming of
You're the one I want to give my love
Everyday I want you more and more
Baby, please, open up your door

I will love you tomorrow
I will love you all the way
I will love you tomorrow
If you'll just love me today

When you're near me, can't you hear my heart?
Sending out a message to never part
Please, don't leave me now, I need you so
If you love me now I'll never go

I will love you tomorrow
I will love you all the way
I will love you tomorrow
If you'll just love me today

Hey, hey, hey
Oh yeah
Hey, hey, hey
Oh, today

I will love you tomorrow
I will love you all the way
I will love you tomorrow
If you'll just love me today, hey, hey, hey

(I will love you tomorrow) ohoho, yeah
(I will love you all the way) I will love you tomorrow
(I will love you tomorrow) if you'll just love me today
(If you'll just love me today) oh, hey, hey!

(I will love you tomorrow
I will love you all the way
I will love you tomorrow
If you'll just love me today)

(I will love you tomorrow
I will love you all the way

I will love you tomorrow
If you'll just love me today)
