I loved you
I feel you
I loved you
I feel you

When we were young
With wild hearts
And wild souls
Beneath the dreams
An open sea
A life for miles
Stretched out before

I miss your voice
And how it felt
We had it whole
With wild souls
You were away
Across the sea
You left a cry

But now I know
How it feels when it's cold
As the winter rose in to your heart
And the tears row with words
Don't you long for the start
Long for the start

I loved you
Hanging on to these words I feel you let me by
I feel you
Hanging on to these words I feel you

So looking back
You went this way
Got caught in the wind
That blue way
But while its souls
Tell fruit for tales
A city's long

So now I know
How it feels when it's cold
As the winter rose in to your heart
And the tears row with words
Don't you long for the start
Long for the start

I loved you
Hanging on to these words I feel you let me by
I feel you
Hanging on to these words I feel you

I loved you
Hanging on to these words I feel you let me by
I feel you
Hanging on to these words I feel you

I loved you
Hanging on to these words I feel you let me by
I feel you
Hanging on to these words I feel you

I loved you
Hanging on to these words I feel you let me by
I feel you
Hanging on to these words I feel you

I loved you
I feel you
