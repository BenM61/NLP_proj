Peace keeping agents from several futures,
They got a warrant out, some judge's letter.
What it is I'm going to do, I haven't done.
They got their probabilities, but I got somethin' much better.

My Rocket 88, fastest in the land.
Crucial, crucial, velocity.

People keep sayin' you got to quit all your lyin',
But cheatin' and lyin' people is all I've ever known.
People keep tellin' me this and that and this and that,
'cause this and that people is all they've ever known.

Does it really matter how it all started,
Does it really matter how it's gonna end?
Reality is gettin' too damn unpredictable,
Unpredictable times call for the reliable friend.

Crucial, crucial, velocity.

Step on it!

Everybody, everybody keeps tellin' me,
"Neil, you got to quit your low down ways."
So I ask them if they have the solution,
And they just shake their heads and slowly walk away.

My Rocket 88, fastest in the land.
Crucial, crucial, velocity.
My Rocket 88, fastest in the land.
Crucial, crucial, velocity.

My Rocket 88, fastest in the land.
Crucial, crucial, velocity.
My Rocket 88, fastest in the land.
Crucial, crucial, velocity.
