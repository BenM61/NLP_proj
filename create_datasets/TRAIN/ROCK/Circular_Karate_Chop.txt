Never took a class before in 
Self defense 
Never looked at you before with 
Common sense

Gird myself for a short sharp shock 
Trace myself in sidewalk chalk
I'll shut my mouth, you do the talking 

You're so proud of your circular karate chop 
Afternoons in the mirror doing pop and lock 
From the junk shop to the truck stop to the big big top

Detention hall, name on the wall and 
Locker dent 
Never mind the withered words of 
Encouragement Pulling off my anorak 
Dumping out my black backpack 
Take what you like I'll keep on walking

You're so proud of your circular karate chop 
Afternoons in the mirror doing pop and lock 
From the junk shop to the truck stop to the big big top

You're still bragging about your telescoping roundhouse kick 
You're still looking for your 
Commodore's old control stick 
So myopic, stay on topic 
And this world is sick

Three rules from your sensei
One, Outsource your feelings. 
Two, Limit your training to be task-specific. 
Three, Assign regret to those accountable.

Man, this world is sick
