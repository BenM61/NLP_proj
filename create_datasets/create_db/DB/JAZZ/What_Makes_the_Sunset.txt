What makes the sunset? 
What makes the moonrise? 
What makes the tide remember to hide and why does it soon rise? 
What makes a star fall? 
Where does it fall to? 
Why does it's flight make us stop in the night and wish as we all do? 

And what holds a cloud together? 
What makes the sky so blue? 

What makes the sunset? 
What makes the moonrise? 
Is it my love for you? 

And what holds a cloud together? 
And what makes the sky so blue? 

What makes the sunset? 
What makes the moonrise? 
Is it my love for you?
