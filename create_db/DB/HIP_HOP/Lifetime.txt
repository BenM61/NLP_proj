The summit, the peaks
The plains and the valley
The ballad, the fog, the bank with the alley
The waking hour, the moment, the dream
The moaning, the murmur, the laughter, the scream
The filling beginning, the quiet finale
Eh eh eh eh lifetime, lifetime
Keep keeping on
Maintain the rock, keep up the rock

The lights in the plaza meant there's something fantastic
The moment I met you, the first look was like magic
Yeah, there's the way that it is and the way that it feels
There's the distance between the ideal and the bills
Yet, I see all the numbers, I still lull for the dreamer
I thank God for the dreamers, lifetime [Repeat: x2] 
Keep keeping on
Maintain the rock, keep up the rock
Maintain the spot, keep up the block
Maintain the rock, keep up the rock

I know this much is true
We don't wanna be lonely
Whether kind or you're cruel, be you no more oh lonely
The riot is easy and the silence is loud
You can build yourself up by just turning things down
We will fashion the law, so why should we feel lonely?
When forever is only, lifetime [Repeat: x2] 
Keep keeping on
Maintain the rock, keep up the block
Maintain the rock, keep up the rock
Lifetime [Repeat: x13]
