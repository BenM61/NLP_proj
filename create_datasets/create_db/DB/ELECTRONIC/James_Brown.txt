I learn to hold my, will power.

Everything. Devoured.
I learn to hold my, will power.

When it comes, it falls in pieces.
Eating holes and gems unbound.
Birds and hearts and flags and everything.

Said, everything. Devoured.
I learn to hold my, will power.

Said, everything. Devoured.
I learn to hold my, will power.

Money matters. Does mercy matter?
Suddenly, as things are clearer,
See the sights are getting nearer.
