It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
I'm just a little crazy

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
I'm just a little crazy

Under my skin and into my bones
I feel insanity begin to make its home
Into my vision and through my mouth
Somebody's working me to get me all strung out

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
I'm just a little crazy

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
I'm just a little crazy

There goes my reason
Where's all my hope
I'm just a puppet pulled by stings to make me cope

I'm seeing nothing
What's all this noise
Could someone give me something
Just to get me through this boy

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
I'm just a little crazy

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
I'm just a little crazy

Under my skin and into my bones
I feel insanity begin to make its home
Into my vision and through my mouth
Somebody's working me to get me all strung out

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
I'm just a little crazy

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
I'm just a little crazy
