A night in television wonderland
Just one more fairytale about some rich bitch 
Lying by the swimming pool
It's the golden school
And life is easy when you make the rules
Last Friday was the first time
It only took about a half a minute 
On the stairway
It was child's play
The odds turn out even 
When you give up believing in the...

[Chorus]
Cold law, steel claw, 
Try to get on board; you find the lock is on the door 
Well, I say, no way!
Don't try to keep me out or there'll be hell to pay! 
I don't know who's right or who's wrong
But it doesn't really matter
When you're crawling in the gutter 
It's a see-saw 
A long, hot battle with the cold law 
Is what you get for messing with the 
Steel claw

The politicians have forgotten this place
Except for a flying visit in a black Mercedes 
At election time
They cross the line
And everybody runs to watch the pantomime
If they could see what's going on around here
So many people hanging on to the edge 
Crying out for revolution! 
Retribution!
The odds turn out even 
When you give up believing in the cold law

[Chorus]

Sometimes I think I'm going crazy 
Sometimes I do a line; makes me laugh
Makes me want to take a joy ride 
On the high tide
Sometimes I'm contemplating suicide 
Meanwhile Bobby's out in Benidorm
I know he's making out with some sweet senorita 
And they go dancing
In the moonlight
The odds turn out even 
When you give up the believing in the cold law

[Chorus]
