Too late the hero
It all comes to zero
And I, I wish I could stop
And start it again.

It's the end of my movie
The bad guys beat me easy
And I, I wish I could stop
And start it again.

It's easy to live in your imagination
If you can't control the situation
You just cut and start it again
It's easy to live in your imagination
You have to make an alteration
You just cut and start it again.

How I wish I could live on the silver screen
Like the stars in the movie magazines
With a happy ending as the final scene.

Too late the hero
It all comes to zero
And I, I wish I could stop
And start it again.

It's the end of my movie
The bad guys beat me easy
And I, I wish I could stop
And start it again.

It's easy, the villains always wear black
They see your guns and turn back
It only happens in the movies
It's easy, the heroes always wear white
The ladies fall off the sight
It only happens in the movies.

As the Viking ship drifts off to the sea
The black sail bursts into fire
I turn to kiss the princess
I have to pacify her
The arrows fall
The sky is red
The music gets higher and higher.

The battle's done
I'm on my way home
A hero's welcome on the shore
Single handed, all by myself
I've just won the war
It was nothing, really.
