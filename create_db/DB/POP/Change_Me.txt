Who (Uh) [Repeat: x29]

You know that I love you
You know that I love you
You know that I need you
Your my air that I breath you
You know that I love you
You know that I love you
You know that I need you
Your my air that I breath you

So don't try to change me
So don't try to change me
Why would you change me
Why would you change me (Baby I will let you go)
So don't try to change me
So don't try to change me
Why would you change me
Baby I will let you go, oh oh oh 

[Keri Hilson]
You knew I, (Ah-ah)
I had my, (Ah-ah)
My voices you said you could handle it
But you lied (Ah-ah)
Cause you tried (Ah-ah)
To change me, mold me and (Oh)

Everything you love before you don't love no more
Everything I did for you don't want no more (You don't want no more)
Maybe I'm not kind of girl you've been lookin' for (Oh, oh)
Would you agree So, How can you not see

[Chorus]
You know that I love you
You know that I love you
You know that I need you
Your my air that I breath you
You know that I love you
You know that I love you
You know that I need you
Your my air that I breath you
So don't try to change me
So don't try to change me
Why would you change me
Why would you change me (Baby I will let you go)
So don't try to change me
So don't try to change me
Why would you change me
Baby I will let you go

[Akon]
Why must I, (Ah-ah)
Decide on, (Ah-ah)
Whether I love you or the world
You met me (Ah-ah)
You fell deeply (Ah-ah)
In love with me so what is the problem now

Everything you love before you don't love no more (You don't love no more)
Everything I did for you don't want no more (You don't want no more)
Maybe I'm quite the man that you've been lookin' for
Would you agree So, how can you not see it!

[Chorus]

[Keri Hilson]
Why would you wanna change me?
Arrange me? Is that what you call love?
Maybe you need somebody different
Somebody who fits you like a glove
But don't change everything
(Don't change me, baby don't change me) That you love
(Don't change me, don't change me, don't change me) About me
When you know that I Love you!

You know that I love you (When you know that I love you)
You know that I love you
You know that I need you
Your my air that I breath you
You know that I love you
You know that I love you
You know that I need you
Your my air that I breath you

So don't try to change me
So don't try to change me
Why would you change me
Why would you change me (Baby I will let you go)
So don't try to change me
So don't try to change me
Why would you change me
Why would you change me (Baby I will let you go)

So don't try to change me
