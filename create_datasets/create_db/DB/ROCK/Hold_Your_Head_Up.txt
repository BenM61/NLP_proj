And if it's bad
Don't let it get you down
You can take it

And if it hurts
Don't let them see you cry
You can make it

Hold your head up
Hold your head up
Hold your head up
Hold your head high

Hold your head up
Hold your head up
Hold your head up
Hold your head high

And if they stare
Just let them burn their eyes
On you moving

And if they shout
Don't let it change a thing
What you're doing

Hold your head up
Hold your head up
Hold your head up
Hold your head high

Hold your head up
Hold your head up
Hold your head up
Hold your head high

Hold your head up
Hold your head up
Hold your head up
Hold your head up

Hold your head up
Hold your head up
Hold your head up
Hold your head up

Hold your head up
Hold your head up
Hold your head up
Hold your head up

Hold your head up
Hold your head up
Hold your head up
Hold your head up
Hold your head up

And if they stare
Just let them burn their eyes
On you moving

And if they shout
Don't let it change a thing
What you're doing

Hold your head up
Hold your head up
Hold your head up
Hold your head high

Hold your head up
Hold your head up
Hold your head up
Hold your head high

Hold your head up
Hold your head up
Hold your head up
Hold your head high

Hold your head up
Hold your head up
Hold your head up
Hold your head high

Hold your head up, hold your
Hold your head up, hold your
Hold your head up, hold your
Hold your head high

Hold your head up
