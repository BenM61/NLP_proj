I'm living on shattered faith
The kind that likes to restrict your breath
There's never been a better time than this
Suffocate on eternal bliss

In a city
That swells with so much hate
You seem to rise above
And take its place
The heart pumps until it dies
Drain the blood, the heart is wise

All my friends are murder
All my bones no marrows in
All these fiends want teenage meat
All my friends are murderers

Away...

I never met a pearl quite like you
Who could shimmer and rot at the same time through
There's never been a better time than this
To bite the hand of the frost bitten menace

All my friends are murder
All my bones are marrows in
All these fiends want teenage meat
All my friends are murderers

Away...away...away...

Whoa whoa whoa whoa...

I'm alive in uterine
A stab in the dark, a new day had dawned
Open up and let it flow
I'll make it yours so here we go...

All my friends are murder
All my bones are marrows in
All these fiends want teenage meat
All my friends are murderers

Away he's gone away...
