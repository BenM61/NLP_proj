This is Christmas season so there isn't any reason
We can't dance the Christmas polka
Hear sleigh-bells ringing' everybody's singing
Dancing the Christmas polka
Christmas trees and holly make everyone so jolly
And love just fills the air
It's a wonderful world for a boy and a girl
While dancing the Christmas polka

The merry Christmas polka, let's dance, let's dance, let's dance
Everyone's so happy, the air is filled with romance
Watch the sweethearts kissing' as they dance underneath the mistletoe
It's a sight to behold for the young and the old
The merry Christmas polka

This is Christmas season so there isn't any reason

And love just fills the air
It's a wonderful world for a boy and a girl
