Done with that pain, I'm just so heartless

I've been so colorblind
And I've been so colorblind

Yeah, yo, yo 
Text that I sent that you never ever read got me feeling like you never ever ever ever really cared (yeah)
But that's ok though
I hope you feel ok though
They used to call me Diego
My favorite drink is Faygo

I've been so colorblind
