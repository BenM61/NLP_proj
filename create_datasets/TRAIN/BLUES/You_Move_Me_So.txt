I don't know what it is about you, baby
That moves me so, it moves me so
I don't know what it is about you, baby
That moved me so, moved me so

It might be your kisses or your warm embrace
It might be the smile on your lovely face
I don't know what it is about you, baby
That moves me so, moved me so

I don't know what it is about you, baby
That moves me so, moves me so
I don't know what it is about you, baby
That moved me so, moved me so

It could be the way that you say 'I love you'
It could be the funny little things you do
I don't know what it is about you, baby
That moves me so, moved me so

I don't know what it is about you, baby
That moves me so, it moves me so
I don't know what it is about you, baby
That moved me so, moved me so

(Incomprehensible) you sip your tea
The funny little way you make love to me
I don't know what it is about you, baby
That moves me so, oh, you move me

You move me so, oh baby, you moved me so
You move me so, you move me so
Kill me, you move me so
