Speed it up, let me through
Don't waste your time , I'll never be like you
Like this cake? Like this hole?
Like there's nothing ever been told
I'm raising hell like a mad machine
Light me up I'm drinking gasoline
Speed it up, don't slow me down
While I look for things that you will never find

I'm just sure that I want more
Burning out at 24
I'm so bored and I want more
24

Ten times removed, don't know where I belong
Explicit words in a birthday song
Like this cream? Like this black?
Like there's nothing holding me back
I'm raising hell like a mad machine
Light me up, I'm drinking gasoline
Speed me up, don't slow me down
While I search for things that you will never find

I'm just sure that I want more
Burning out at 24
I'm so bored and I want more
Give me more

I know things will never change
I know things will stay the same here
I know I can't rearrange this

24...

Speed it up, let me through
Don't waste your time I'll never be like you
Like this cake? Like this hole?
Like there's nothing ever been told
Like this cream? Like this black?
Like there's nothing holding me back
I'm raising hell like a mad machine
So fucked up, I'm drinking gasoline

I know things will never change
I know things will stay the same here
I know I can't rearrange this
'Cause I know me
