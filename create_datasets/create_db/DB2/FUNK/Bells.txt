There are four black horses
With eyes of flaming red
Their rovers are tied with ribbing
All around my baby's head 

The bells are ringing And their sail is going to sea 
Yes I know why they're ringing
They ring on for me
Oh yea 

I wish I could see my baby
This can't happen to me
No...

Baby please forgive me
I know I've caused you pain
I'll place your tears with diamonds
Just to see your face again 

Ashes into ashes
Dust to dust
Ashes into ashes
