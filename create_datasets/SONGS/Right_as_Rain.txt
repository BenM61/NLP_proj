Blue misty morning, an empty street in Ol' Paree
She appeared like the angel of destiny
He spent a lifetime tryin' to reach beyond that rainbow
And found when you look down it gives you vertigo.

The dancehall is deserted where lonely worlds collide
This must be where dreams explode before your very eyes
While the world outside grows more insane
Bein' with you, I feel no pain
True like blue, right as rain
Right as rain.

I hope real soon I'll be hearing from 'ya
I'll be in the wings, I'll be cheering for you
Funny how people think your life is so complete
When it's really you who envies the man on the street.
I must've strayed from a path wandering through the catacombs
And you came along to guide my restless spirit home

I can't tell you why, no I wouldn't try to explain
Bein' with you, I feel no pain
True like blue, right as rain
Right as rain.

It's all in the cards, it's all in the game
Bein' with you, I feel no pain
True like blue, right as rain
Right as rain.
