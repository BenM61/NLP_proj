In olden days, a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking.
Now heaven knows
Anything goes

Good authors too who once knew better words
Now only use four-letter words writing prose.
Anything goes

The world has gone mad today
And good's bad today,
And day's night today,
And black's white today,
And most guys today
That women pries today
A just silly gigolos

And though I'm not a great romancer
I know you about to answer when we propose
Anything goes (goes) (goes) (goes)

The world has gone mad today
And good's bad today,
And day's night today,
And black's white today,
And most guys today
That women pries today
A just silly gigolos

And though we're not a great romancers
We know that you about to answer when we propose
Anything goes
Anything goes
Anything goes
