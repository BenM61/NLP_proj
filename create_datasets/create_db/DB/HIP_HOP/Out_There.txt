Stackin' me some grip, playa can ya dig?

Where I'm from man, ain't no sunshine
Only shine on a doggs ass if his ass don't get on the grind
Doin' time help a nigga out to clear up my head
Use to have a shank and a knife that was by my bed

It was said I would end up dead working in the streets
But the streets is the only thang I see payin' me quarter key f*ck
Servin' deals rockin' to the shake slangin' guns slangin' TV's
Man, I'm tryin' to make all I can my nigga puncho at a hoes house

Get her drunk, take her to the back, put dick in her mouth
Leave the front door unlocked, my nig turn the radio
Pull the car up into the yard, cleaning out the hoe
You should know that a burglary really ain't for me

I just got out the tentary tryin' to get my feet
Get the cheese off the merchandise, went a bought a deal
Nigga , please you say you don't steal I'ma keep it real

And game splita I'm also a wig splita your ass getta
Shoot up by the 9 mila, your cap I drilla
When fucking with real nigga the chrome trigga

To get ya nose outta niggas biz quit spreadin' rumors
Like a motherfucking punk bitch, my trunk is the bed
For a kidnapped victim, hollow point hit them pull out my gun
Your hands, you get them up in the air

See you have manifest in terror I know these bullets
Will pop your shit off like a meleon, let's bust it up man
F*ck man who you tellin' it's armagedeon the North Memphis crack
