Don't you want to ride in my
Survival car
We can take the long way home
Through Central Park

Funny how the ground can find my wheels
I'm going where the road ain't there
And only riding on the path we made
To Union Square

Doing like the young folks do
In west coast towns
Plowing like a banshee through
The overground

Funny how the ground can find my wheels
I'm going where the road won't dare
And only riding on the path we made
To Union Square

Everybody hit the ground
I think I might have missed my calling
Everybody turn around
The light's about to change
You better stand aside
Why you want to walk
Don't you want to ride, ride, ride, ride

Don't you want to ride in my
Survival car
We can take the long way home

Funny how the ground can find my wheels
I'm going where the road won't there
And only riding on the path we made
To Union Square
And only riding on the path we made
Riding on the path we made
Riding on the path we made
To Union Square

Don't you want to ride in my
Survival car
We can take the long way home
