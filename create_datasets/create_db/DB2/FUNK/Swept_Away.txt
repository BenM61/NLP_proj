I was lying there, lying on the beach
I dreamed you were there
I feel the heat, the sun and the waves
When you touch my hand
We were on a desert island
And I had a dream, I was swept away

You and I are on an island
Where I thought the storm would never end
I saw your light on the horizon
And I knew that I was blown away again

No it doesn't matter, yeah
It doesn't matter
'Cause nothing lasts forever
'Cause nothing last forever
No it doesn't matter, yeah
It doesn't matter
'Cause nothing lasts forever
Nothing last forever

I was swept away, I was swept away
Swept away, I was swept away with you
Swept away, I was swept away
Swept away, I was swept away with you

The rise and fall is endless
The risk you run of being lost in blue
You caught my drift while I was restless
When the current flows, I'm gonna flow with you

No it doesn't matter, yeah
No, it doesn't matter
'Cause nothing last forever
Nothing last forever
No it doesn't matter, no
No, it doesn't matter
'Cause nothing last forever
Nothing last forever

I was swept away, I was swept away
Swept away, I was swept away with you
Swept away, I was swept away
Swept away, I was swept away with you

For a day or maybe for a lifetime
Break away is he throwing me a lifeline
If I say that this will be the last time
Swept away, will it end with you?

I was swept away
Swept away, swept away
Swept away, swept away, swept away

No it won't, no it won't, no it doesn't matter
Nothing lasts forever
Nothing lasts, nothing lasts, nothing lasts forever
Swept away, nothing lasts forever

No it won't, no it won't, no it doesn't matter
Nothing lasts, nothing lasts forever
Nothing lasts, nothing lasts, nothing lasts forever
Swept away, nothing lasts forever

No it won't, no it won't, no it doesn't matter
Nothing lasts, nothing lasts, nothing lasts forever
Swept away
