Wild town is dead and a new day born 
Behind the sea where we grew up 
Still the same fear makes me sick 
I am proud of you my son 

You will be the chosen one 
I don't care what they say 
I wanted to breathe, but I can't 
Say hello to me my best friend 

You're already dead 
There was a time when we reached towards the rainbow 
We touched it when it was too low 
Some day I'll be stronger than a dark night 

Free like a sun I'm ready to the other side 
I don't care what they say 
Say hello to me my best friend 
I wanted to breathe, but I can't 

I'm already dead 
And no-one knows what they're talking about 
And now I know they've got nothing inside 
And no-one knows what I'm talking about 

And now I know what they want
But, I don't care what they say 
I wanted to breathe, but I can't 
Say hello to me my best friend 

You're already dead
