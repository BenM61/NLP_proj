I've got teardrops in my tequila
I've got teardrops in my tequila
Got Colorado, not enchiladas, on my mind
Ain't it cold as hell in Santa Fe

Makes me shiver to my toes
Things ain't going well in Santa Fe, oh no
Make them two tacos to go, senor
I've got teardrops in my tequila

I've got teardrops in my tequila
Got Colorado, not enchiladas, on my mind
Goodbye, see you later Santa Fe
Then the freeway will take me home

Where the air is clean, 
The open fields, the meadow green
I won't be so all alone
