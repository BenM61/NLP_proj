Break me on the thirty-seventh hour
Tout me, doubt me, show me all of your power
I will watch you rise on my back from the ground
Friend or foe?
I don't know
Do you like what you've found?

Because I will one day shine with you
I'll shine on a faithful few

Show me low quotations
Have you earned your stripes?
Fabricate salvation
Lord, I know your type
I've known you all my life
I was always wrong, you all in white

Brush my cause aside with little trouble
Oh my god, I think I'm hearing double
I will watch you rise on my back from afar
Friend or foe?
I don't know now you're up in the stars

But I will one day shine with you
I'll shine on a faithful few

Show me low quotations
Have you earned your stripes?
Fabricate salvation
Lord, I know your type
I've known you all my life
I was always wrong, you all in white

Show me low quotations
Have you earned your stripes?
Fabricate salvation
Lord, I know your type
I've known you all my life
I was always wrong, you all in white
Show me low quotations
Have you earned your stripes?
Fabricate salvation
Lord, I know your type
I've known you all my life
I was always wrong, you all in white
