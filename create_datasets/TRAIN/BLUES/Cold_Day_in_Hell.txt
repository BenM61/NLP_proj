So many times you tried to take the best of me. 
So many times, now you're gonna take the rest of me. 
Better look at what you're doing before it's too late. 
It's a fine line you're treadin' between love and hate. 
There'll be a cold day in hell 
before I'm coming back to you. 
So many times you tried to play a dead end game. 
Yes, you did. 
I tried to tell you, but you'd never wanna take the blame. 
Now you've pushed me to the limit, and I can't take no more. 
You'd better take one last look before I'm out the door. 
There'll be a cold day in hell 
before I'm coming back to you. 
You never listened when I told you 
that you were way out of line. 
Too busy talkin' to listen, 
accusing me of telling lies. 
So many times you tried to get the best of me. 
Yes, you did. 
So many times, but now you're gonna take the rest of me. 
Well, it's too late for sorry and it's too late for tears. 
Better take one last look before I disappear. 
There'll be a cold day in hell 
before I'm coming back to you. 
There'll be a cold day in hell 
before I'm coming back to you. 
There'll be a cold day in hell 
before I'm coming back to you. 
Yeah! 
(Gonna be a cold day in hell) 
(Gonna be a cold day in hell) 
(Gonna be a cold day in hell) 
(Gonna be a cold day in hell) 
(Gonna be a cold day in hell) 
(Gonna be a cold day in hell) 
(Gonna be a cold day in hell) 
(It's gonna be a cold, cold day in hell)
