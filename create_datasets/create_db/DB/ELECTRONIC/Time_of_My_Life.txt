From the east to the south
I tongue the roof of my mouth

To new days of doubt without you

First gear
I face the trouble ahead
Final word has been said
Long distance spread between us
I tell myself to

Hold on
It won't be long
Till I grow through this struggle

Time to wake up
Find my soul

Happy without you
Happy without you
Happy without you
Happy without you
Happy without you

Not called for weeks now
Six days without sleep means
I am a slave to my early grave
If I do not be brave, behave
Seize myself out of this mess
I have created of myself, yet again
Yet again I say

Hold on
It won't be long
till I grow through this struggle

Time to wake up
Find my soul

Happy without you
Happy without you
Happy without you
Happy without you
Happy without you

We go on
Heart beats strong
Still whole
Unbroken
As we divide
Our love, goodbye

Thanks for the time
Time of my life

Happy without you
Happy without you
Happy without you
Happy without you

Time
Time
Of my life

Time
Time
Of my life (So happy without you)

Time
Time
Of my life

Thanks for the time of my life (Happy without you)
Happy without you
Happy without you
