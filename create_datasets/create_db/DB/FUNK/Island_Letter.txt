How did you think about me at all?
Or just happened to hear my call?
'Cause I didn't get the chance to tell you
That I would want to see you again
Oh how I miss you

We talked about your beaches
And we laughed about your trip
To the States, what a gas
And you're here without holding a past
Could you tell that this was going to last?
Oh I want you
