In a while now
I will feel better
Ill face the weather before me
In a while now ill race the irony
And by that each word of my eulogy

All the uninvited tragedies
Step outside

Ask yourself now
Where would you be without
Days like this
When you finally collide
With the moment you cant forget

So do I remind you of
Someone you never met
A lonely sillouette
And do I remind you of
Somewhere you wanna be
So pull at a leash is too far out of reach
Oh I wish you open up for me
'Cause I wanna know you
Amaryllis
Bloom

Stay a while now
Undress your colors
'Cause there like no other
Ive ever seen
I could get used to your company
Step inside

Ask yourself now
Where would you be without
Days like this
When you finally collide
With the moment you cant resist

So do I remind you of
Someone you never met
A lonely sillouette
And do I remind you of
Somewhere you wanna be
So pull out a leash
Oh I wish you open up for me
'Cause I wanna know you
Amaryllis

In a while now
I will feel better
I will be better

So do I remind you of
Someone you never met
A lonely sillouette
And do I remind you of
Somewhere you wanna be
So pull out a leash
Oh I wish you open up for me
'Cause I wanna know you
Amaryllis
Bloom
Amaryllis
Bloom
Amaryllis
