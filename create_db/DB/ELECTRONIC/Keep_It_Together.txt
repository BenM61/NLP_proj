I feel the skin that separates us, start to fade
And when I lye on top of you, I'm afraid
I can see right through myself, crystal clear
I am disassembling
I could disappear, disappear
There is a voice inside of me, I don't know
And all his words keep echoing trim and low
I've been waiting for a sign to appear
He has a message waiting for me
But I don't wanna hear
I promise, I swear, I can not keep it together
I can not keep it together
I can not keep it together
I can not keep it together

I can not keep it together
I can not keep it together
I can keep it together
I can keep it together
I can keep it together
I can keep it together
I can keep it together
I can keep it together
I can keep it together
I can not keep it together
I can keep it together
I can keep it together
I can keep it together
