From a town known as Wheeling, West Virginia 
Rode a boy with a six gun in his hand 
And his daring life of crime 
Made him a legend in his time 
East and west of the Rio Grande. 

Well he started with a bank in Colorado 
In the pocket of his vest, a Colt he hid 
And his age and his size 
Took the teller by surprise 
And, the word spread of Billy  the kid 

Well he never traveled heavy 
Yes he always rode alone 
And he soon put many older guns to shame 
And he never had a sweetheart 
And he never had a home 
But the cowboy and the rancher knew his name 

Well he robbed his way from Utah to Oklahoma 
And the largest could not seem to track him down 
And it served his legend well 
For the folks they loved to tell about 
When Billy the kid came to town. 

Well one cold day a posse captured Billy 
And the judge said String him up for what he did.
And the cowboys and their kin 
Like the sea, came pouring in 
To watch the hanging of Billy the kid. 

Well he never traveled heavy 
Yes he always rode alone 
And he soon put many older guns to shame 
And he never had a sweetheart 
But he finally found a home 
Under the boot hill grave that bears his name. 

From a town known as Oyster Bay Long Island 
Rode a boy with a six pack in his hand 
And his daring life of crime 
Made him a legend in his time 
East and west of the Rio Grande.
