Kid, what changed your mood?
You've gone all sad, so I feel sad too
I think I know
Some things, you never outgrow

You think it's wrong, I can tell you do
How can I explain?
You don't want me to

Kid, my only kid
You look so small, you've gone so quiet
I know you know, what I'm about
I wont deny it
Will you forgive?
You don't understand
You've turned your head
You're on my head

All my sorrow, all my blues
All my sorrow

Show the light, the way
Full of grace
You've covered your face
Kid, creatious Kid
Your eyes are blue
But you wont cry I know
Angry tears, are too dear
You wont let them flow
