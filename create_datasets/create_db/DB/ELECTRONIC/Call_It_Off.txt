I won't regret saying this
This thing that I'm saying
Is it better than keeping my mouth shut
That goes without saying

Call, break it off
Call, break my own heart
Maybe I would have been something you'd be good at
Maybe you would have been something I'd be good at

But now we'll never know
I won't be sad
But in case I go there
Everyday, to make myself feel bad
There's a chance that I'll start to wonder if this was the thing to do

I won't be out long
But I still think it better if
You take your time coming over here
I think that's for the best

Call, break it off
Call, break my own heart
Maybe I would have been something you would be good at
Maybe you would have been something I would be good at

But now we'll never know
I won't be sad
But in case I go there
Everyday, to make myself feel bad
There's a chance that I'll start to wonder if this was the thing to do
I'll start to wonder if this was the thing to do
