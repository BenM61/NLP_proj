Listen to the tide (aaah)
It pulls us in
Close to end of time (aaah)
Can we begin?
Lookin' through, to your eyes (aaah)

Follow, follow, follow, follow
Aaah, aaah, aaah

We are out of tune (aaah)
But feels so right
Tide will be in soon (aaah)
This soft and light
Summer ends soon (aaah)

Follow, follow, follow, follow
Oooh, oooh, oooh
