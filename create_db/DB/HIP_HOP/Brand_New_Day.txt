You may have done, some things that you're not
To proud of, at one point in your life
Well, you're just one good pray away
From living again, starting today

It's a brand new day, spread the news, go tell a friend
It's alright to love, it's okay to live again
Nevermind your faults, what you've done or where you've been
'Cause what's in your heart, it's all that matters in the end
It's a brand new day

Maybe you were involved in a love gone bad before
Ever since then, you've been bitter and scorn
All those bad feelings, you no longer need to hold
'Cause we're in with the new out with the old

It's a brand new day, spread the news, go tell a friend
It's alright to love, it's okay to live again
Nevermind your faults, what you've done or where you've been
'Cause what's in your heart, it's all that matters in the end
It's a brand new day

Yes it is, things that made you angry in your past
Now you look at them and you can laugh
'Cause they don't and they won't
Matter anymore

It's a brand new day
Brand new day
Brand new, brand new day
Brand new day
Brand new day
Brand new day, oh

It's brand new day, spread the news, go tell a friend
It's alright to love, it's okay to live again
Nevermind your faults, what you've done or where you've been
'Cause what's in your heart, it's all that matters in the end

It's brand new day, spread the news, go tell a friend
It's alright to love, it's okay to live again
Nevermind your faults, what you've done or where you've been
'Cause what's in your heart, it's all that matters in the end

It's brand new day, spread the news, go tell a friend
It's alright to love, it's okay to live again
Nevermind your faults, what you've done or where you've been
'Cause what's in your heart, it's all that matters in the end
