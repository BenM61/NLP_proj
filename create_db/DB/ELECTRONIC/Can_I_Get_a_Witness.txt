I need a witness

I need a witness

Can I get a witness
You're always on my mind
But you never know
Witness are looking at me
I want you to know that
I love you endlessly
I will never leave you
Not you

I don't want to be alone tonight (tonight tonight tonight)
Baby if I call you
Will you turn up before midnight
I just want to hold you in my arms.. my arms
And show you my love has no "but"
To me you'll never were a front
Wanna spend a little time with you
With you (the time I need you)
And a little while since we have shield out and a modest
I just wanna stick on you like glue
At you

So tell me baby if you feel it too
I know we can make it
If we try
I'm not get you tried otherwise
Baby I won't fake it
No, never, never
