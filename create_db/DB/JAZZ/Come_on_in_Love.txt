Steady your heart baby, this one might hurt
The buildings are burning, the people will fall down
Momentum relentless, so steady the senses
The exit wound's fresh, he's keeping his distance
Bleed on my floor
And take back your old habit
Just like a friend searching for heaven too soon
And I will find your remnants when you are gone
Blow through the glass, cut straight to the hole
Steady your heart baby, this one might hurt
The buildings are burning, the people will fall down
Momentum relentless, so steady the senses
The exit wound's fresh, he's keeping his distance
Do the artsy thing and die
Someone unprepared will find you
The best surprise is on the unprepared
My hope grows no older
Reality keeps its distance
Could I turn back time
Take back a wasted life?
Or do we only get one?
Only so much can be forgiven
So lets pretend it's supposed be this way
Steady your heart baby, this one might hurt
The buildings are burning, the people will fall down
Momentum relentless, so steady the senses
The exit wound's fresh, he's keeping his distance
Do the artsy thing and die
Someone unprepared will find you
The best surprise is on the unprepared
I wasn't there
These walls they have eyes
They have seen your demise
They've witnessed the loss of all hope
And I wasn't there
I wasn't there
No warnings, no screams
You cut loose all your dreams
This cant be the end you had planned
And I wasn't there
We were so unprepared
