I've just been to see my best friend
He's got another girl 
Says she's just about the best thing 
In the whole damn world 

And he says can't you see what the little lady's done for me 
Says it like he thinks I'm blind
But the things that you see ain't necessarily the things you can find 
But those

Happy loving couples make it look so easy 
Happy loving couples always talk so kind 
Until the time that I can do my dancing with a partner 
Those happy couples ain't no friends of mine 

People say I'm too damn fussy 
When it comes to girls 
Happy couples say I must live
In a lonely world 

Want to be, want to really be what my friends pretend to be 
Be it in my own good time 
Being kind to myself till I become one of two of a kind 

Happy loving couples make it look so easy 
Happy loving couples always talk so kind 
Until the time that I can do my dancing with a partner 
Those happy couples ain't no friends of mine 

You ain't no friends of mine 
You know what I mean 
Happy loving couples 
In matching white polo-necked sweaters 

Reading Ideal Homes magazine
Yeah! 
Want to be, want to really be what my friends pretend to be 
Be it in my own good time 
Being kind to myself till I become one of two of a kind 

Happy loving couples make it look so easy 
Happy loving couples always talk so kind 
Until the time that I can do my dancing with a partner 
Those happy couples ain't no friends of mine 

You ain't no friends of mine 
You ain't no friends of mine 
You ain't no friends of mine 
You ain't no friends of mine 
You ain't no friends of mine 
Right, that's enough
