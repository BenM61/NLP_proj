It's gonna be a blue winter without you
It's gonna be a blue winter for me
While other lovers sit holding hands
By a warm fireplace
I'll be home, all alone
Longin' for your warm embrace

It's gonna be a blue winter without you
I'm headin' for a blue winter I see
Our love's too young to grow old
Darlin' don't leave me out in the cold
Don't let it be a blue winter for me

Our love's too young to grow old
Darlin' don't leave me out in the cold
Don't let it be a blue winter for me
Don't let it be a blue winter for me.
