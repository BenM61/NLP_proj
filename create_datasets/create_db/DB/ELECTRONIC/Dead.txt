In your youth you had your fill
The curtain's closed, the silence still
In your head you are the star
But I can see you as you are 
CHORUS:
Dead
You're so out of touch
Dead
Because you talk too much
You think you're on higher ground
Intelligence so profound
But I'm never coming down

Your razor tongue has lost its rhyme
The words are dull and out of time
You make no difference to me
'Cause I can't teach the blind to see

REPEAT CHORUS

SOLO

REPEAT CHORUS
