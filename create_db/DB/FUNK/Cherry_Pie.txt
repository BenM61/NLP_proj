Gotta find out what I meant to you.
You're the one who broke my heart.
Gotta find out what I meant to you.
You're the one who broke my heart.

When I met you boy, you were as sweet as cherry pie.
That smiling eye you were as wild as Friday night.
I should have known however hard you try.
Change'd come and strangle it.
It was bound to die.

You were sweet as cherry pie,
Wild as Friday night.
Sweet as cherry pie,
Wild as Friday night.

Gotta find out what I meant to you.
You're the one who broke my heart in two.
Gotta find out what I meant to you, oh boy.

Gotta find out what I meant to you.
You're the one who broke my heart in two.
Where were you just when I needed you?

You gave me your soul for at least a day.
"Listen boy, there was a time when I wanted you to stay."
You'll know the cost, it's you who's gonna pay.
I'm stronger now, I loved you then.
I'll ask you anyway.

You were sweet as cherry pie,
Wild as Friday night.
Sweet as cherry pie,
Wild as Friday night.

Gotta find out what I meant to you.
You're the one who broke my heart in two.
Where were you just when I needed you, boy?

Gotta find out what I meant to you.
You're the one who broke my heart in two.
I needed you

You teased me.
You broke my heart.
You broke my heart.

You were the only one.
You were the only one.
You're a son of a gun.

You were the only one.
You were the only one.
Oh boy, you broke my heart.

Sweet as cherry pie.
Sweet as cherry pie.

Gotta find out what I meant to you.
You're the one who broke my heart in two.
Gotta find out what I meant to you, oh boy.

Gotta find out what I meant to you.
Where were you just when I needed you?
Gotta find out what I meant to you, boy.

Where were you when I needed you?
You were the only one.
You were the only one.
Son of a gun.

You were the only one.
I'm feeling strong,
I loved you then.
So I ask you anyway.

Gotta find out what I meant to you.
You broke my heart.
Gotta find out
Gotta find out what I meant to you.

You tease me.

You were the only one.
You were the only one.
Son of a gun.

You were the only one.
You were the only one.
