Oh, say, can you see, by the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hail'd at the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight
O'er the ramparts we watch'd, were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

O, thus be it ever when freemen shall stand
Between their lov'd homes and the war's desolation
Bles't with vict'ry and peace, may the heav'n-rescued land
Praise the pow'r that hath made and preserv'd us as a nation!
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just
And this be our motto, "In god is our trust"
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?
