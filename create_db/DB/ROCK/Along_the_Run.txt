Everything in nature moves in waves
Watch them extend out in every way
Waves of fire sick with flame
Waves of water form the ocean's blame

Just to see you go that way
Lost from sight and then seen again
Your one true wave
Your one true way

It always takes you back to the same place
With every minute a mystery
Every day was a tragedy
Yeah all and every single one

And every minute I spent with you
Another minute that I could use
To show you why our time was done
'Cause I lost you somewhere along the run

Farewell the chance that you could be the one
Try not to feel let down
Get filled up with the pouring rain
Or the the wind with its awful sound

Or the sun with its simple shame
You know I always will see your face
And I always will say your name
Yeah I'll always remember you
