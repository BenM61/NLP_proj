I just got out my little red book
The minute that you said goodbye
I thumbed in through my little red book
I wasn't gonna sit and cry

And I went from A to Z
I took out every pretty girl in town
They danced with me and as I held them

All I did was talk about you
Hear your name and I'd start to cry
There's just no getting over you, ohh, no

There ain't no girl in my little red book
Who could ever replace your charms
And each girl in my little red book
Knows you're the one I'm thinkin' of

Ohh, won't you please come back
Without your precious love I can't go on
It's hard to be, I need you so much

All I did was talk and talk about you
Hear your name and I'd start to cry
There's just no getting over you, ohh, no

Ohh, won't you please come back
Without your precious love I can't go on
It's haunting me, I need you so much

All I did was talk about you
Hear your name and I'd start to cry
There's just no getting over you

All I did was talk and talk about you
Hear your name and I'd start to cry
There's just no getting over you, ohh, no

All I did was talk about you
Hear your name and I'd start to cry
There's just no getting over you

All I did was talk and talk about you
Hear your name and I'd start to cry
There's just no getting over you, ohh, no
