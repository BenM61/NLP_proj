So good things comes for those wait, sure
I've waited about pop pop pop pop
That's four cousins shot
I got grudges, let's discust this
My music needs no touch ups
I got a long record of f*ck ups, trust me
You don't know who has this weight of mine,
Or a life as hard as mine
I had to hustle, chop, sell drugs, grind
Whatever you wanna call it is fine,
But just listen
And don't prejudge
I don't want anyone dissmissin' me as another thug or some shit like that
No sir, if I fall I will get right back
I got circumstances, but let me stop dancin' around the issue
And tell you straight forward, I'm poor
A refugee been in prison and survived the war
I come from the most dangerous city in this universe
You're likely to get shot at birth

So how could rap quench my thirst?
I don't even hear verses no more!
I hear jerkin' off punks with lip glosses and purses!
I don't see nobody operating shit anymore I see nurses!
F*ck that! I'm gonna stay alive! I'd rather do a stage dive!

And if rap gets jealous
'Cause I rock heavy
It don't worry me if motherfuckers don't get it
Yo if rap gets jealous
'Cause of where I'm headed
I used to be public enemy, don't forget it
And if rap gets jealous, 'cause rock heavy
It don't worry me if motherfuckers don't get it
Yo if rap gets jealous
'Cause of where I'm headed
Aggression! Obsession! With pain! Live a game!

So yeah
Basically I gotta release, occasionally
I gotta let you know what's goin' on with me
And facing me, 'are some tough choices
I got a good side and bad side, inside my head
I hear screams and loud voices
And I can't lie I ain't got shit, I ain't got to brag,
I'm hard pressed for some cash to send to my I'll dad
You're so superficial?, of course it's for shizzle?
Now my choice is to piss on you, boy
'Cause my mission is the world
To know, my name, my aim, is plainly success
But I still gotta come fresh!

That's what it is, it's pain, you know what I'm saying?
I don't know man it's like
You spend years developing your artistry
Know what I'm sayin'? Perfecting your skills
Yeah, you can't do shit with it,
That has gotta be Fucked up!, know what I'm sayin'?
That's gotta be Fucked up, you know
Just imagine like, imagine you build a Fuckin' castle
And you can't live in it, That's what it is
You can't live it, you know
And you got problems, you got family
I got family, moment of truth right?
And I still gotta come fresh!
