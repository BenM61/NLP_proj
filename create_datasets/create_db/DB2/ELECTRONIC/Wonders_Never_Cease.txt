What do you feel
When you let go of the wheel
Can you take a leap of faith
Will you face the change of pace
There are worlds out there
Beyond compare

Going on a journey
Somewhere far out east
We'll find the time to show you
Wonders never cease

All that we've been through
Brings my soul so close to you
Why not cast your fears aside
We can laugh until we cry
There are worlds out there
Beyond compare

Going on a journey
Somewhere far out east
We'll find the time to show you
Wonders never cease

Going on a journey
Somewhere far out east
We'll find the time to show you
Wonders never cease
Wonders never cease
Wonders never cease
Wonders never cease

Wonders never cease
Wonders never cease
Wonders never cease
Wonders never cease

Wonders never cease
Wonders never cease
Wonders never cease
Wonders never cease
