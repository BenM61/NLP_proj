Her lips are sweet, her legs are big
Her looks can make you dance a jig
Her touch is so soft, her heart is so warm
What knocks me out is her hidden charms
Her voice is so soft, her love is so true
I think about her, that's all I do
She's weak and wanton in my arms
What moves me, darling, is your hidden charms
Hoo-wee, what a baby, hoo-wee, what a baby

When I hold her in my arms
Brings out all of her hidden charms

Her kiss is so pure as the morning dew
A real gone love that's frightening, too
Her eyes that talk, they say come on
What kills me, baby, is your hidden charms
Hoo-wee, what a baby, hoo-wee, what a baby

When I hold you in my arms
Brings out all of your hidden charms
