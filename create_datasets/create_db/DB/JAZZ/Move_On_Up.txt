Shake, shake, quiver, quiver
I'm awoken by a cold shiver
Wind blows change, change
Sweet rushing through my veins

No, I just might die
Overtaken by the high tide
Feel the rain against my skin
Drown my soul in the water again

Move on me
Move on me
Move on me

Shake, shake, should have learned
Get that close and you might get burned
Sweet heat and the sweet lies
So betrayed by the look in your eyes

That look I know so well
It's a heaven with a taste of hell
On your lips and down within
Drown my soul, baby let it begin

Move on me
Move on me
Move on me

Give me two hands I can hold
I'll tell you things I've never told
Move on me
If you move on me, yeah

Baby, timing's everything
Now's the time to let you in
Move on me
If you move on me, yeah

If you move on me
If you move on me
If you move on me
If you move

Move on me
