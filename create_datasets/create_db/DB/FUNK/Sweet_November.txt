Baby, what's wrong with us?
I feel a storm coming.

When autumn first arrived you were my lady.
And love was written in the wind to show
And with the change of months there came October.
And now I wonder where our love did go.
It was the second rain of autumn we shared our feelings.
It was such, such a glorious autumn dream, yes it was.
But like kids we were too shy to say to each other that together, we would always like to be.

Someday soon I know we'll come together.
Even though our feelings change as seasons do.
But, maybe sweet November will tell us the story that will bring us back the love that we both knew.

When autumn first arrived you said you'd be my lady and you promised me that you would never go, ooh hoo.
And with the change of months there came October and now I'm wondering Where?
Where did our love go?
It was the second rain of autumn (second rain of autumn) we shared our feelings.
And it was such, such a glorious autumn dream, yes it was.
But like kids we were too shy to say to one another that together we would always like to be.

Someday soon I know we'll come together.
Even though our feelings change as seasons do.
