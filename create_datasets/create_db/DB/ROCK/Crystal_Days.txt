Here am I
Whole at last with a golden view
Looking for hope
And I hope it's you
Splitting my heart
Cracked right in two
The pleasure of pain endured
To purify our misfit ways
And magnify our crystal days

Where are you
In shadows only I can see
Looking for hope
And you hope it's me
Tattered and torn and born to be
Building a world where we can
Purify our misfit ways
And magnify our crystal days

Pure and to magnify

Here am I
Whole at last with a golden view
Looking for hope
And I know it's you
Splitting my heart
Cracked right in two
The pleasure of pain and joy
To purify our misfit ways
And magnify our crystal days

Purify our misfit ways
And magnify our crystal days

Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do

Days
