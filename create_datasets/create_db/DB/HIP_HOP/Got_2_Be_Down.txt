This goes out to you and you and you
Check it out, one two, one two
Uh huh, yeah, yeah

All this love and aggravation
I've wasted so much of my life
All this truth and separation
We work so hard to make things right

Got that lovin', got that seed
Got that suga', got that sweet
Got that money, got that beat
Got that whatever you need
Oh, I can't hide it; you're my world
Got me thinking I'm no good
Chocolate lover, you're so sweet
Got me thinkin' on my feet

Sayin', there'll be no problems (no, baby) to get out of
I got to be down (said, I got to)
And amazing (amazing) or I'll go crazy (go crazy)
In this house
Oh, I got to be down, woo

(We gotta get it together) c'mon
(We gotta get it together) sweet baby
(We gotta get it together) I got to be down
(We gotta get it together) woo, ooo, ooo

You were always number one to me
Even when I cursed your name
And if I could (and if I could)
I would've been gone (you would have been...)
But nothing's like being in love with you, babe

Got that lovin', got that seed
Got that suga', got that sweet
Got that money, got that beat
Got that whatever you need
Oh, I can't hide it; you're my world
Got me thinking I'm no good
Chocolate lover, you're so sweet
Got me thinkin' on my feet

Sayin', there'll be no problems (no, baby) to get out of
I got to be down (I got to)
And amazing (amazing) or I'll go crazy (go crazy)
In this house
Oh, I got to be down, woo

We gotta get it together (ooo, baby)
We gotta get it together (you know)
We gotta get it together (I got to be down)
We gotta get it together
We gotta get it together (c'mon)
We gotta stick together (sweet baby)
We gotta stay together (I got to be down)
We gotta get it together (ooo, ooo, ooo)

I'll go crazy, baby, without you (c'mon, baby)
Oh, I got to be down (yeah, yeah)
And amazing (amazing) or I'll go crazy (go crazy)
I'll go crazy (so crazy) without you
I got to be down

We gotta get it together (c'mon)
We gotta get it together (sweet baby)
We gotta get it together (I got to be down)
We gotta get it together (got to, straight up got to)
We gotta stick together (ooo, pretty baby)
