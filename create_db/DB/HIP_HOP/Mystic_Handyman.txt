Mystic handyman (oh oh ooh), my little girl
Can you bring a little sweetness into my bitter life?
'cause the woman I love has got to let me go
I will remember her

She's the one that made me happy
She's the girl that drove me crazy

Mr gregory (oh oh ooh)
Can you sing a weeping willow and oh my tumbling tears
'cause the woman I love has set herself above
The things I bring to her

She's the one that made me happy
She's the girl that drove me crazy

I'll never forget her
How she could turn my heart around
She'll leave me a letter
It's telling me how it hurts to go
How she loves me so

Mr number one (oh oh ooh), b-b-b-bah
Ba ba ba bah, b-b-bah, b-b-bah, b-b-bah, b-b-bah
Oh you know I'll miss her so
I-I-I ba bah

She's the one that made me happy
She's the girl that drove me crazy

I'll never forget her
How she could turn my heart around
She'll leave me a letter
It's telling me how it hurts to go
How she loves me so

I never have loved her
Not if she leaves me and
That's not the way
It should be like now
Show me how
