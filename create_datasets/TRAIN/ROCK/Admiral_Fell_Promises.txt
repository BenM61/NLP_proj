Come out from the burning fire butterfly
Let me lock you in my room and keep you
For a while
Could you be the answer to my every prayer?
Could you be the one for who I care?

Come into my arms and let your worries die
Come out from the web of all your tangles lies
But be true to me and I'll be true to you
Judge me not for what I've done but what I'll do

A million nights have led
To this one that we are spending
And I know it's better here
Than anywhere I've been going
With every morning grew
A void more wide and endless

Come out from the burning fire butterfly
Let me lock you in my room and keep you
For a while
You watch over me and I'll watch over you
And if you go tomorrow choke me till I'm blue

A thousand days have passed
In this house she and I were sharing
And I hate myself for it
But I have stopped caring
The Marilyn sky tonight
Is so black and blue and beautiful
