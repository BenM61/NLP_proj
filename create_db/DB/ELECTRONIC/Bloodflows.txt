Shotgun poetry
Crack the whip again, make me see
Sharpen your knives for me
Infiltrate the mind, the body
Body

Contract killer pros
Calmly walks away as blood flows
Open, the wound grows
Melts away the water froze

My love, my love, my love don't love me.
My love, my love, my love don't love me.
My love, my love, my love don't love me.
'Cause my love, my love, my love don't love me.

Contract killer pros
Calmly walks away as blood flows
Open, the wound grows
Melts away the water froze

My love, my love, my love don't love me.
My love, my love, my love don't love me.
My love, my love, my love don't love me.
'Cause my love, my love, my love don't love me.

My love, my love, my love don't love me.
My love, my love, my love don't love me.
