Butterfly Baby, lookin' around,
Flyin' like crazy, all over town.
Oh you little Butterfly Baby, I'll hang around
Hopin' that maybe someday you'll settle down.
When you're done and there's only one
Who will your honey be?
Hear my plea, won't you let it be:
Me, it better be me!
Butterfly Baby, 'bout time you knew:
I love you like crazy, I love only you.
Oh you little Butterfly Baby when will you see
Butterfly Baby, oooo, you've got a trial with me.

When you're done and there's only one
Who will your honey be?
Hear my plea won't you let it be
Me, it better be me!
Butterfly Baby, when you are free,
You'll be my baby, ya, exclusively.
Oh you little Butterfly Baby, then you will see
Butterfly Baby, oooo, you'll only fly with me.
Wa-ooooo, wa-ooooo,
Wa-ooooo, wa-ooooo,
Wa-ooooo, wa-ooooo,
Wa-ooooo...
