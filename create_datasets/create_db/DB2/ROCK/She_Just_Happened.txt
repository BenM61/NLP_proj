What took her to the city was some sort of scholarship. 
Some Fancy New York Fashion Institute. 
Her Junkie Boyfriend took to crime, which took up too much of her time. 
It only took a year till she took a different Route.

What just happened?
She just happened?
She just happened to cross my mind?
Without warning she crossed my mind?
What just happened to me?

She moved into this building next to the one I used to trash. 
She lived there with this roommate I despised. 
We found a room against the tracks. 
Don't stay out late, and watch your backs. 
Make sure to lock the door we were advised.

Oh Yeah! Oh Yeah!
Oh Yeah! Oh Yeah!

From there it went nowhere, and after that it fell apart. 
The next thing I remember here we are. 
Not to diminish what it was. 
Well there's no reason to becuase. 
All though it was so long, anyways it seems so far.
