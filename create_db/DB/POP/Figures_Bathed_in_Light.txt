Drop down to the floor
Hold my head in your hands
I fell asleep on you
So we lost in the end

I saw a figure bathed in light
Holding you from me

I know that I missed you
And that they carried you out to sea
I held onto tomorrow 
You were waiting for me

Follow us off the road
Hit the brakes I saw your face
I asked if you could stay here
And get us out alive 

I saw a figure bathed in light 
Holding you from me 

I know that I missed you
And that they carried you out to sea
I held onto tomorrow
You were waiting for me

I saw a figure bathed in light 
I saw a figure bathed in light 

I know that I missed you 
And that they carried you out to sea
I held onto tomorrow 
You were waiting for me

You were waiting 
You were waiting 
You were waiting for me
