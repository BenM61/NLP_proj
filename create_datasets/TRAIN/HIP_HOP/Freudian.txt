You are the reason
The reason I sing
I have to preserve you
Cause you're my everything
Babe I know I fucked up
Focus on them B cups
'Cause you got your friends too
Better believe in it
Truth I'm up on my luck
Can't stop running amok
But you got your friends too

I just want to thank you for saving my life, yes
I just want to thank you for all your advice

You are the reason, the reason I'm alive
I must bring you honour
If I don't, I'd die
I know I brought shame
Put a mock on your name
But you got your thanks too, better believe it I
Rising up from the flame
The phoenix that I became
But you got your thanks too

I just want to thank you for giving me life yes
I just want to thank you for all your advice

Send me kisses when it's grey skies
It's been so long look how time flies
If you love me won't you let me know
I've been trying to learn let you go
Call my name whenever tears fall
When you face your fears you stand tall

Send me kisses when it's grey skies
It's been so long look how time flies
If you love me won't you let me know
I've been trying to learn let you go
Call my name whenever tears fall
When you face your fears you stand tall

Know I'd take a bullet for you
No you don't know what I go through
And I know you think you're kinda nice
Do you remember when I saved your life
Don't come at me on some weak shit
It's time you stopped displaying weakness, oh, oh

Hey momma
It's your second son the same I ain't changed momma
I made some change
Times have changed on me
Times have changed (minds have changed)
My mind feel strange momma but I feel the same
I feel ashamed when I'm face to face with my faith
Face to face with my faith momma, I lost my faith

Isn't it nice
Human sacrifice
The universe got it
I got too excited
And now we're taking life
Isn't it nice
Human sacrifice
I hate consequences, that shit is too expensive
You keep chasing delight
Isn't it nice
Human sacrifice
I take the easy way out every time
I don't deserve my own life
Isn't it nice
Human sacrifice oh yes
Say I'm a martyr
Charge that to my ego
I just want all the lights
