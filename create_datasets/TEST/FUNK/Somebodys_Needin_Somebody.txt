Someone somewhere's fallin' asleep
In a chair in front of the TV
'Cross town somebody's up
And walkin' the floor at a quarter to three

In some little corner of the world
A forgotten soul, is waitin' by the phone
And right down the hall someone's in there feelin'
Like cryin', 'cause they're livin' all alone

Somebody's needin' somebody, the way I do
Somebody's wantin' somebody, they can hold on to
To be loved by somebody, that's the way it should be
Oh, there's got to be somebody, somewhere waitin' for me

Late at night, it's lonely and I wonder how I'll ever get through
There's got to be somebody, somewhere who's feelin' it too
Hurtin' inside, goin' through the motions, it's so hard to live
So many feelin' so lonely, when they got so much to give

Somebody's needin' somebody, the way I do
Somebody's wantin' somebody, they can hold on to
To be loved by somebody, that's the way it should be
Oh, there's got to be somebody, somewhere waitin' for me

To be loved by somebody, that's the way it should be
Oh, there's got to be somebody, out there waitin' for me
