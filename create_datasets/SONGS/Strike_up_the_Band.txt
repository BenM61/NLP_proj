Let the drums roll out
Let the trumpet call
While the people shout, "strike up the band"

Hear the cymbals ring
Calling one and all
To the martial swing, strike up the band

There is work to be done, to be done
Let's have fun, fun, fun
You son of a gun of a gun, take your stand

Form a line, oh, oh
Come on, let's go
Hey, leader, strike up the band!

There is work to be done, to be done
Let's have fun, fun, fun
Come on, son of a gun of a gun, take your stand

Form a line, oh, oh
Come on, let's go
Hey, Mr. Leader, 
Hey, Mr. Leader,
Please strike up the band!
