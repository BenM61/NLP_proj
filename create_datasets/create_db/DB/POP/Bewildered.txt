Bewildered
Lost in a dream of you
Where is the love I knew
Why did we part?
Bewildered
Helpless without you near
Wishing your heart could hear
What's in my heart
Must I have sleepless nights and endless days?
Oh love why did you leave my soul without a spark?
I'm in the dark
Bewildered
I need your guiding hand
I'll never understand
How you could love me, then leave me
Bewildered
