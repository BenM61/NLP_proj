When I first met you baby, baby
You were just sweet sixteen
You just led me on, baby, sweetest thing I'd ever seen

But you would not do nothing for me baby, you would not do
Anything I asked you to
Now, you ran away from your home baby, now you want to run away from me too

Well, my brother, he's in Korea, and my sister, down in New Orleans
Well my mother's up in heaven, lord, what's gonna happen to me?

Yes I love you, I've always loved you
Ever since I called your name
But seems like everything I do, oh, has been in vain

Sweet sixteen, sweet sixteen
Sweet sixteen, sweet sixteen
Well, the sweetest thing that I ever seen, sweet sixteen
