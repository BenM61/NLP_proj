Do you remember when we played that game?
It wasn't hard but it turned out that way
When you were gone they'd try to take your place
But it just wasn't the same
No it just wasn't the same

How was I supposed to know
I'd never escape her ghost
It seemed not long ago
She was mine to protect
Can't get her off my mind
No matter how hard I try
I'm out of options this time

I'm calling on you to make this happen 
I need to know this'll turn out right
But I can't change her mind
So I'm calling on you
Calling on you

I felt the final straw
I found out that she moved on
I wish I knew before
I gave her my heart
Now when I try to sleep
My body begins to scream
I'll burn as long as I breathe

I'm calling on you to make this happen 
I need to know this'll turn out right
But I can't make her mine
So I'm calling on you
Calling on you
