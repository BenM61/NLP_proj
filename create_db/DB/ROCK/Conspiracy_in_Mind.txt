Here in a deadly maze, there is something hiding in the dark,
In clouded minds where hate and anger collide
I spiral into a grand illusion in a world of reality beyond
Then the secret of my inner self will reveal

I see tears in your eyes
I sense weakness inside
I will take you far away,
To the deepest of your dreams
Let me in on your stream,
To the entrance of your deep

I watched in disbelief

Imprisoned in a deadly maze
The enemy rise from within
Risking their lives on a dangerous search
With conspiracy in mind

Taste the hate within
Human weakness
A solution to the mystery
With conspiracy in mind

Now hear my warning
All you sinners on the porch
Sweet relief from the pain of longing
Remember this twisting smile

Unspeakable anguish
Heaven's out of reach
When mother nature will surely
Descend, and sleep for eternity

Please release the weight
That lies on my shoulders
Please release the weight
That lies on my shoulders

I spiral into a grand illusion
In a world of reality beyond
I see tears in your eyes
Always out of reach
I want to sleep for eternity

I see tears in your eyes
I sense weakness inside
I will take you far away,
To the deepest of your dreams
Let me in on your stream,
To the entrance of your deep

I watched in disbelief

Imprisoned in a deadly maze
The enemy rise from within
Risking their lives on a dangerous search
With conspiracy in mind

Taste the hate within
Human weakness
A solution to the mystery
With conspiracy in mind
