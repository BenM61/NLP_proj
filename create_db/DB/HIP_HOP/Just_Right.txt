Yea
Gotta love this
NS
For real
Just rock with it like
Uh huh, uh huh, huh

Fo Shizzle

G.A.N.G.S.T.A
From what I see girl its a must we stay
Together Forever
You see cause ever is ever
And never ever would nobody do it better
Than the S, oh yes
Guess your blessed
I put the rocks on your fingers,
Earrings jingle
No more single
You gotta man in your life
And I understand what your like
Your friends don't understand why you be seeing me
But they don't understand your love is treating me
The way I walk,
The way I Look,
The I talk,
The way we make love in the dark
Somethings in life were meant to be
I thank God above that you were sent for me
See cause my point of view is all about you
You got to tell me what you want girl

It ain't a thing, mama, anything
You need from me baby, please take this ring
It's like braille
Girl the way I feel
It's something that I can't conceal
For sure you're my light
Personified
Myself I can only try
To measure your shine
On an earthly scale
Everything else is pale
Compared to you

[Bridge]
Baby you're my cure, you're my remedy
So sincere and pure, said I'll never leave
I'll stay by your side, for eternity
Til the day I die babe
Said you're my cure, you're my remedy
So sincere and pure, said I'll never leave
I'll stay by your side, for eternity
Til the day I die because

[Chorus]
Baby you're just right for me
(You're just right for me, babe)
I'm just right for you
(And I just wanna share your life)
Come and share your life with me
(Share your life with me babe)
And I'll share my life with you
(And I'll share my life with you, girl)

Anything that I may have
Anything that I'm blessed to grab
I'll split it in half
For your tender touch
Your loving girl it means so much
I'll love you in style
On a sun drenched isle
After we go down the aisle
You're the thrill in my life
Our love is amplified
The type that only God provides
And it comes from you

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

And if it's love you need
I'll give it to you baby
And if you want the world on a platter
I'll give it to you baby
Said if it's up to me
I'll give it to you baby
Anything you need it don't matter
I'll give it to you baby

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Baby your just right for me
(your just right for me babe)
I'm just right for you
(yeah, baby come and share your life)
Come and share your life with me
(just share your life with me babe)
And ill share my life with you
Baby your just right for me
I'm just right for you
Come and share your life with me
And ill share my life with you
