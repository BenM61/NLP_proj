Let me tell you 'bout a guy I know 
He is my baby and he lives next door 
Every mornin' 'fore the sun comes up 
He brings me coffee in my favorite cup 
That's why I know, yes, I know 
Hallelujah, I just love him so 

When I'm in trouble and I have no friend 
I know he'll go with me until the end 
Everybody asks me how I know 
I smile at them and say,  "He told me so" 
That's why I know, oh, I know 
Hallelujah, I just love him so 

Now, if I call him on the telephone 
And tell him that I'm all alone 
By the time I count from one to four 
I hear him (KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK) on my door 

In the evening when the sun goes down 
When there is nobody else around 
He kisses me and he holds me tight 
And tells me,  "Baby, everything's all right" 
That's why I know, yes, I know 
Hallelujah, I just love him so 

Now, if I call him on the telephone 
And tell him that I'm all alone 
By the time I count from one to four 
I hear him (KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK) on my door
