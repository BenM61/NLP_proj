Hey, sunshine
In the clouds above your head
Words don't come easy
When there's lonely days ahead

There's a place for you and me
Love can come so easily
I'll reach out and take your hand
Believe in me, you'll understand

Love won't come to those
Who don't want to believe in love
It won't come to those
Who don't want to believe in love
Like you and me

All we need is love like you and me

I'll bring you sunshine
If you'll only follow me
Over the Rainbow
On the other side you'll see
There's a place for you and me
Love will come so easily

I'll reach out and take your hand
Believe in me, you'll understand

Love won't come to those
Who don't want to believe in love
It won't come to those
Who don't want to believe in love
Like you and me

All we need is love like you and me!
