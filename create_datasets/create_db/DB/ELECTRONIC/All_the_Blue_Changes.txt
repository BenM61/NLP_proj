all the blue changes, 
all the blue chains. 
all the blue changes rearranged. 

giving up on beautiful 
and making peace with strange, 
all the blue changes rearranged. 

all the blue changes, 
all the blue chains. 
all the blue changes rearranged. 

giving up on beautiful 
and giving up on pain. 
all the blue changes rearranged. 

all the things we were - 
rearranged. 

the city in a hundred ways, 
it wouldn't let you stay. 

the city in a hundred ways 
would never let you stray.
