Bewildered, lost in a dream
In the love I need why did we part
Bewildered, has love, has love died dear
Wishing your heart could feel
What's in my heart
Must I have sleepless night
And endless days
Oh love why did you keep my soul
Without a spark I'm in the dark
Bewildered
I need your, I need your I need your guiding hand
I'll never, no I'll never understand 
How you can love me, how you can love me 
How you can love me, how you can love me
How you can love me and leave me bewildered, bewildered
