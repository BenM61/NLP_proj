Just when I feel alone inside
Baby I miss you and
That's when I come to realize
Why I am and why I act this way
Into my eyes like a ray of sunshine
That's how you start my day
And nothing's ever really changing this time
Things will always be this way

'Cause it feels so good I'm gonna make it
I'm gonna make it when I see you smile baby
It feels so good I'm gonna make it
I'm gonna make it when you spend a little time with me
'Cause it feels so good I'm gonna make it
I'm gonna make it when I see you smile baby
It feels so good I'm gonna make it
I'm gonna make it when you spend a little time with me

Spend a little time with me

My love it ain't easy sometimes
So much standing in my way
Then you come and all my worries are gone
You just know what to say
'Cause your love is all I need to get by
It's all I need today.
Nothing's ever really changing this time
Things will always be this way

'Cause it feels so good I'm gonna make it
I'm gonna make it when I see you smile baby
It feels so good I'm gonna make it
I'm gonna make it when spend a little time with me
'Cause it feels so good I'm gonna make it
I'm gonna make it when I see you smile baby
It feels so good I'm gonna make it
I'm gonna make it when you spend a little time with me

Feels like I'm gonna make it this time, with my baby x4

'Cause it feels so good I'm gonna make it
I'm gonna make it when I see you smile baby
It feels so good I'm gonna make it
I'm gonna make it when you spend a little time with me
'Cause it feels so good I'm gonna make it
I'm gonna make it when I see you smile baby
It feels so good I'm gonna make it
I'm gonna make it when you spend a little time with me
