I love you so

I love you so
I want you to know
I'm telling you, darling
I'll never let you go

I need you true
I hope you do too
I'm telling you, darling
I'll never let you go

Well, you know
How much I love you
And that we'll never part
And you know that I need you
I'm keeping here in my heart

I love you so
I want you to know
I'm telling you, darling
I'll never let you go

I love you so
