Hey!
Ready for the big time, ready for the small
Whatever's comin' to me, I'll be ready for it all
Sometimes it's ain't easy, sometimes it's not polite
Some days I don't get it, some days I get it right

It's in my heart, it's in my head
That's what I said
Hey boys are you ready for the shock
I'm livin' proof, the girl can rock
Spread the news around every single block,
Hey boys, the girl can rock

Standin' in the spotlight workin' up a sweat
Givin' all I got and lovin' what I get
I can't hold back what I feel inside
And if I make you nervous, you'd better step aside

It's in my heart, it's in my head
That's what I said
Hey boys are you ready for the shock
I'm livin' proof, the girl can rock
Spread the news around every single block,
Hey boys, the girl can rock

The girl can rock
Don't say maybe or call me baby
I ain't crazy at all

It's in my heart, it's in my head
That's what I said
Hey boys are you ready for the shock
I'm livin' proof, the girl can rock
Spread the news around every single block,
Hey boys, the girl can rock

I'm gonna live it up
I'll never give it up
I'm gonna spread the news around the block
It ain't no shock, the girl can rock
It ain't no shock, the girl can rock
It ain't no shock, the girl can rock

Yeah, rock!
