Every time I close my eyes
I hide behind the blackened lies
That follow me
Throughout my history
The lives I've touched
The things I've done
The things I know will never come
Get washed away
In my happiness
And oh, when you feel stranded
Don't take for granted
This thing called life
And oh, when you feel stranded
Don't take for granted
This thing called life
Moving on was hard to do
To leave the things that I once knew
Childhood is the one thing
That won't come back to me
How can I sit idly by
Watching all these hours denied
My name is all I have
For an offering
And oh, when you feel stranded
Don't take for granted
This thing called life
And oh, when you feel stranded
Don't take for granted
This thing called life
Built up walls that crumbled down
People marched and stood their ground
I saw it happen
It was part of me
And oh, when you feel stranded
Don't take for granted
This thing called life
And oh, when you feel stranded
Don't take for granted
This thing called life
Oh, (don't take for granted)
Oh, (don't take for granted)
Oh, (don't take for granted)...
