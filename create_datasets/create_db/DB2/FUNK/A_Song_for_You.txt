I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs I've made some bad rhymes
I've acted out my life in stages
With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song to you

I know your image of me is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly but darlin' can't you see
There's no one more important to me
Baby can't you see through me
Cause we're alone now and I'm singing this song to you

You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing
You came out in front when I was hiding
Now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding

I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for my life you?re a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing this song to you

We were alone and I was singing this song to you
We were alone and I was singing this song to you
