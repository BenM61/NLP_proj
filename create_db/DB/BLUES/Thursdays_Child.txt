Monday's child is fair of face
And Tuesday's child is full of grace.
Wednesday's child is full of woe,
But Thursday's child has far to go.

Things look mighty black
For Thursday's child,
Trouble dogs the track
Of Thursday's child.
This world could be a wonderful place,
But not when you wear Thursday's face!

I never know which way I'm bound,
I'm Thursday's child;
Heartbreak hangs around
For Thursday's child.

I'll always be blamed
For what I was named,
But still I'm not ashamed,
I'm Thursday's child.

I'll always be blamed
For what I was named,
But still I'm not ashamed,
I'm Thursday's child.
