Down under the night sky
I lay and wait
Praying to whoever
Will listen to me
I founded my own cross
Been clutched by its weight
There's no darker message
Than turning your face

I'll see you down the end of the road
I deal in a different story
Oh, I will never let go again
I feel it in my bones (bones)
Bones (bones)
I feel it in my bones (bones)
Bones (bones)
I'll do this on my own
Oh oh oh oh bones bones oh

When thin spirit swelling
My poor flesh is always weak
I found everything I needed
Right beneath my skin, oh

I'll see you down the end of the road
I deal in a different story
Oh, I will never let go again
I feel it in my bones (bones)
Bones (bones)
I feel it in my bones (bones)
Bones (bones)
I'll do this on my own

We're all architects of our own private hell
No one can hurt us like we hurt ourselves

I'll see you down the end of the road
I deal in a different story
Oh, I will never let go again
I feel it in my bones (bones)
Bones (bones)
I feel it in my bones (bones)
Bones (bones)
I know I'm not alone
Oh oh oh oh bones bones oh
