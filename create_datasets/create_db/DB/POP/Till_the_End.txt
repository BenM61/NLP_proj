(Hold up will you love me)
(Hold up) (hold on tonight)
(Hold up will you love me)
(Hold up) (hold on tonight)

(Hold up will you love me)
(Hold up) (hold on tonight)
(Hold up will you love me)
(Hold up)

All my fear is running out
And I feel like I survived
'Cause I'm like the earth when the rain doesn't wanna fall
Back when I thought that I had it all
All my feelings flooding back for you

And I said
Am I gonna make you mine
Can I really change your mind
Will I get it right this time
Will I get it right this time

'Cause  I want to believe
That I will keep fighting 'till the end
And I should have believed
That you were much more than just a friend, a friend

You've been away for far too long
Now I'm knocking at your door
'Cause you're like the chain pulling me where I shouldn't go
Back to the place where I'd never grow
Something tells me that I have changed for good

And I said
Am I gonna make you mine
Can I really change your mind
Will I get it right this time
Will I get it right this time

'Cause  I want to believe
That I will keep fighting 'till the end
And I should have believed
That you were much more than just a friend, a friend

Oh won't you come back for me
I want you, I want you
Oh won't you come back for me
I want you, I want you

'Cause I want to believe
That I will keep fighting 'till the end
And I should have believed
That you were much more than just a friend
And I want to believe
That I was just fighting for a friend
That should have believed that we could have made it 'till the end, the end
