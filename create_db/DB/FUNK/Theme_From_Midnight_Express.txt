As the night is leaving
Silently retreating down an empty hall
Suddenly a stirring
Finally recurring where I let it fall

Following the wanderings of a dream
A dream that keeps my soul alive
Believing in an open sky
Believing in a love

Dancing with a stranger
Careless of the danger
There within his smile
While the dew was forming

Breathing in the morning
Like a sleeping child
If the memory of the light should fade
Horizons reaching cold and blue

Until your heart is free to fly
Then I will keep the sun for you
Until you touch the open sky
Then I will keep the sun for you
Until we never say goodbye
Then I will keep the sun for you
