For my poor heart's sake,
Guess it's time to take the long way out,
Like a stone in my shoe, there's always someone who wants to slow me down.
When the sun stops shining,
It's time to walk away from the clouds.

Give me one good reason to keep on loving you.
I know I wasted all my feelings when I gave them all to you.
But taking back the hand of control feels good for the soul, yay yay yay.

Say you want all of me, then you try to split my world in two
Say you give me everything, then you bring me nothing more than blue
When the sun stops shining,
It's time to set your sight on the moon

Give me one good reason to keep on loving you.
I know I wasted all my feelings when I gave them all to you.
But taking back the hand of control feels good for the soul, yay yay yay.
Feels good for the soul

Give me one good reason to keep on loving you, oh.
I know I wasted all my feelings when I gave them all to you.

Give me one good reason to keep on loving you, oh.
Cause taking back the hand of control feels good for the soul, yay yay yay.
