There's such a lot of good ways to be bad
And so many bad ways to be good, haven't paid my rent yet
I tell them "sorry but I haven't got the money anymore"

Just for today I thought I'd leave home alone, hold hands with day
And if I'm so bad, why don't they take me away?

Just like what you hear with a shell pressed to your ear
That's the sea in the trees in the morning
Hello, The Universal
Good morning Steve, well you won't believe me today

Working doesn't seem to be the perfect thing for me so I'll continue to play
And if I'm so bad why don't they take me away?

Well, a hippy-trippy name-dropper came through my door
He said "I just bumped into Mick he told me you know where to score?"
No, not me friend, I mind my own and my own minds me

Well, my love is at the foot of your hand, come what may
But if June comes first please won't you take me away?
