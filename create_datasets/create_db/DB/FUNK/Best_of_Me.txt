Saw you again at the parlor
Crossing the walk with your lady
I caught your eye from afar
I noticed she wore a ring
I found a smile against my will
Wish it was genuine
I put away my desire
No more in love with you still
Look, I am moving on, ooo

Loved you, lost you, thought I'd give you all the best of me
We departed brokenhearted; I need to be free
What we had was oh-so lovely, I'll swallow my pain
It's my time to find the best of me

Can't be the time to be beggin'
Can't be the time to plead
My mama made me much wiser
What's mine will be just for me, yeah
I'm trying hard just to focus
I'm trying hard to sleep
Promise, I'm glad you're happy
When it's my time, it will be
Look, I'm moving on, whoa, whoa, whoa

Loved you, lost you, thought I'd give you all the best of me
We departed brokenhearted; I need to be free
What we had was oh-so lovely, I'll swallow my pain
It's my time to find the best of me

Oh my, why have I been
Just so foolish all this time?
Not realizing the beauty that your eyes once saw in mine
I guess it's time to find the best in me

Loved you, lost you, thought I'd give you all the best of me
We departed brokenhearted; I need to be free
What we had was oh-so lovely, I'll swallow my pain
It's my time to find the best of me

Oh, oh, oh, the best of me
