This is just a little samba
Built upon a single note
Other notes are bound to follow
But the root is still that note

Now this new note is the consequence
Of the one we've just been through
As I'm bound to be
The unavoidable consequence of you

There's so many people
Who can talk and talk, and talk
And just say nothing
Or nearly nothing

I have used up all the scale
I know and at the end
I've come to nothing
I mean nothing

So I come back to my first note

As I come back to you
I will pour into that one note
All the love I feel for you

Any one who wants the whole show
Re mi fa so la ci do
He will find himself with no show
Better play the note you know

So I come back to my first note
As I come back to you
I will pour into that one note
All the love I feel for you

Any one who wants the whole show
Re mi fa so la ci do
He will find himself with no show
Better play the note you know
