A test, a test, a test, no rest
No rest, no rest
Just when you wanna exhale
Yoga down hill
He stands in the light kisses your ears
Just when you wanna relax
Wanna be alone
A crowd comes
Then a test, a test, a test, no rest
No rest, no rest

Just when you wanna give up
And everything's flat
Emotions running back and forth
There's no rest, no rest
Hurry to be on track
Don't wanna walk back
Steady on the elevator lift to the top
Then a stop, a challenge
Confess confess

Up and down the hill
All around the carousel
A flowery smell
A dead end

A stop, a stop, a challenge
Confess, confess

The test, a test, a test no rest
No rest, no rest
Just when you think it's the end
And everything's black
Hiding in the dark there's a sudden flash light
And your back
Back on the elevator lift to the top, another stop
