Such a Night
It's such a night
Sweet confusion under the moonlight.

Such a night
Such a night
To steal away, the time is right.

Your eyes met mine
At a glance
You let me know
This was my chance.

You came here with my best friend Jim
And here I am
Trying to steal you away from him...

Oh, but If I don't do it somebody else will
If I don't do it, you know somebody else will

And it's such a night
Such a night
Sweet confusion under the moonlight

It's such a night
Such a night
To steal away, the time is right.
I couldn't believe my ears
And my heart just skipped a beat
When you told me to take you walking down the street.

You came here with my best friend Jim
And here I am
Stealing you away from him.

Oh, it's such a night
