I work hard every day
Do the same at night
But still my baby
Ain't treating me right

Tell me baby, baby, baby, baby
What can I do?
Do I have to shut your mouth
Just to get along with you?

When I'm home at night
I can't read a book
Without you being huffed up
Giving me a dirty look

Tell me baby, baby, baby, baby
What can I do?
Do I have to shut your mouth
Just to get along with you?

She's so jealous, man
Till it's a sin
She don't even trust me
Out with men

Tell me baby, baby, baby, baby
What can I do?
Do I have to shut your mouth
Just to get along with you?
