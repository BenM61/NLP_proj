Well, I got a gal
She lives up on the hill
Well, I got a gal
She lives up on the hill
Well, this woman's tryin' to quit me, Lord
But I love her still

She's got eyes like diamonds
They shine like Klondike gold
She's got eyes like diamonds
They shine like Klondike gold
Every time she loves me
She sends my mellow soul

Well, you're so beautiful
You've got to die someday
Well, you're so beautiful
You've got to die someday
All I want's a little loving
Just before you pass away

Pretty baby, I'm goin' away
And leave you by yourself
Pretty baby, I'm goin' away
And leave you by yourself
You've mistreated me
Now you can mistreat somebody else
