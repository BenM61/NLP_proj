No more school days
Packed my bags and I'm on my way
Summer seems so exciting
So electric and frightening
Wish you were here
Doing just what we did last year
From July to September
Every moment I still remember

Love in the sun so crazy
Girls, lazy summer days, just lying in the sand
And walking hand in hand
Dancing to the band

July one kiss
Never knew summer felt like this
No more thunder and lightning
The water looks so inviting
I knew some day
I'd be giving my heart away
I could stay here forever
But forever is 'till September

Love in the sun so crazy
Girls, lazy summer days, just lying in the sand
And walking hand in hand
Dancing to the band

We'll walk in the fairground
They'll be playing old songs
Songs of love and laughter
Then we'll kiss and say goodnight

Love in the sun so crazy
Girls, lazy summer days, just lying in the sand
And walking hand in hand
Dancing to the band
