People, if they choose you, then they want you to decide
But you'd rather relax, kick back, enjoy the ride
There's a category if you're straight or gay
You're a wild card gambler and you like it both ways

Everybody wants you when you're bi
Looking at the girls and eyeing all the guys
Everybody loves you when you're bi
But the tension and the passion's double amplified

My lover told me, well, that she's bi
I wanted to scream, there were tears in my eyes
She said baby, baby, don't you cry
'Cause the one I am with, you've been seeing on the side

Everybody wants you when you're bi
Eating with the girls and laughing with the guys
Everybody loves you when you're bi
But the tension and the passion's double amplified

Everybody wants you when you're bi
Feeling all the girls and touching all the guys
Well, everybody loves you when you're bi

Well a friend of a friend of a friend told me
Everybody's messed up with their sexuality
Well a friend of a friend of a friend told me

I need a closet big enough to live in
A closet for the whole world to live in
I want a closet big enough to live in
A closet for the whole world to live in

Everybody wants you when you're bi
Loving all the girls and loving all the guys 
Everybody needs you when you're bi
But the tension and the passion's double amplified

Everybody wants you
That's right
Everybody needs you
Um-hum
Everybody likes you
I'll bet
Everybody loves you

Everybody, yeah
Everybody
Everybody, come on now
Everybody, not me

Everybody, who
Everybody, yeah
Everybody, come on now
Everybody

Well everybody loves you

Bi
Licking all the girls
Licking all the guys

Everybody's fucked up with their sexuality
You like it both ways
