Confess what you crave
A life without pain
You'd kill for the taste
But the hurt still remains

Still they don't know who you are

Just be still my emerald
I'll be waiting for you
Do exactly what you're told
I'll be waiting for you

Ashamed by the threats
You pierce the embrace
Afraid and alone
In a dark lonely place

Did you always want to be
Did they try to steal your soul
Did they hurt you with deceit
Can't you come in from the cold
Be still my emerald
I'll be waiting for you
