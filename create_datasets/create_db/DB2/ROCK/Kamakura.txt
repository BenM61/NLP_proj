Drinking when you're drunken 
To chase down the evening 
God that girl goes graceful 
Wondering which way's home
I heard nothing was changing
And that's the shirt you're wearing
No wonder no one's noticed
That the summer's been and gone
No one says a word
Because it breaks a heart
Submarine keep diving
Seagulls at the waste bins
Wish them all a winter
Must be rough at sea

He's given a bloody nose to the best friend he knows
The only time he's cried since he was seven years old 
Your best friends forgive you,
Your best friends forget you get old

Steaming at the corners
When the blue pulled over
Said he wanted seasons
Miss red hot October
The Black Maria
Is where he finds his honor
The darker the corner
Now the summer's been and gone
No one says a word because it breaks a heart
The coming and the going
Blame it on the ocean
Or coastal erosion
It must be rough at sea

He's given a bloody nose to the best friend he knows
The only time he's cried since he was seven years old
Your best friends forgive you,
Your best friends forget you get old, you get old

He's given a bloody nose to the best friend he knows
The only time he's cried since he was seven years old
Your best friends forgive you,
Your best friends forget you get old, you get old

No one says a word,
Because it breaks a heart

No one says a word,
Because it breaks a heart

No one says a word,
Because it breaks a heart

No one says a word,
Because it breaks a heart
