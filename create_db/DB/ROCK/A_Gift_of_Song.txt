A gift of song is a gift of love,
Though how this is I cannot say.
But who receives a gift of love,
Must send it freely on its way
As I receive, so let me give,
And live in joy my whole life through

A gift of song, is a gift of love
Here comes a gift of love for you

A gift of song is a gift of love
It falls to earth, we know not where
But who receives a gift of love
It follows then that he must share
As I receive, so let me give,
And live in joy my whole life through.
