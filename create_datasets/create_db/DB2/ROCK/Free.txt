If you're scared then walk away, cause there's no need to feel ashamed,
Yeah we all feel the same.
I fell in love with rock and roll until I found out it was false,
And plastered on a face for me.

Whoa, where's you passion, where's your fire tonight,
Whoa, I can't believe there's nothing you're willing to hide,
Whoa, I want to believe,
I set my body on fire so I could be free.

So I could be free, yeah.
So I could be free,
So I could be free, yeah.

And don't be told it can't be done, because the best all die young,
Yeah we all feel the same.
And if there's nothing left to say, just have the guts to disagree,
Or plaster on a face for me.

Whoa, where's you passion, where's your fire tonight,
Whoa, I can't believe there's nothing you're willing to hide,
Whoa, I want to believe,
I set my body on fire so I could be free.

So I could be free, yeah.
So I could be free,
So I could be free, yeah.

Free,
Free.

Free,
So I could be free, yeah.
So I could be free,
So I could be free, yeah.
