I'm looking right at you, but you're not there
I'm seeing right past you, but you seem well aware
Your body is here but your mind is somewhere else
So far gone and you think I can't tell
Can't tell that you are disconnected
You pulled away and I miss your presence
I always said to you

Baby you should be here, right here
Baby you should be here, right here
Don't know where you went but you're lost now
Don't know where you went but you're gone now
Don't know where you went but you're lost now
Don't know where you went but you're gone now

Head on your chest babe, but your heart is so quiet
We use to talk all night long, now we laying in silence
Your arms around me but your soul is somewhere else
Gone so long and I know you so well
I know that you are everything that I ever dreamed of
And hoped that love had a happy ending

Baby you should be here, right here
Baby you should be here, right here
Don't know where you went but you're lost now
Don't know where you went but you're gone now
Don't know where you went but you're lost now
Don't know where you went but you're gone now
You should be here, right here yeah
