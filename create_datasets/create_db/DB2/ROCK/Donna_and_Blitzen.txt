Pay for the light
But you may still slide
Baby it's not your sleigh ride
But this year is ours
Maybe tomorrow
We're gonna see

Things we'd never believe
I'll make u want me you'll see
The initial warning is free
But only two reindeer

Oh what a sight as they take their first flight
Oh darling it's all in time
And I will, I will, I will

I will, wait their return
Or make to the sky
Oh what a sight beautiful
And I will
I will, I will, I will

I will sleep tonight
I will sleep tonight
