Feels like I'm waiting
Like I'm watching
Watching you for love
Dreams, where I am fading
Fading

So free my mind, all the talking
Wasting all your time
I'm giving all
That I've got

Feels like I'm dreaming
Like I'm walking
Walking by your side
Keeps on repeating
Keeps on repeating
Repeating
Repeating

So free my mind, all the talking
Wasting all your time
I'm giving all
That I've got

If you want me
If you need me
I'm yours
If you want me
If you need me
I'm yours
If you want me
If you need me
I'm yours
If you want me
If you need me
I'm yours

If you want me
If you need me
I'm yours
If you want me
If you need me
I'm yours
