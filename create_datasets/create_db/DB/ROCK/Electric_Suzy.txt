Baby, baby, I got something for you
Little Suzy come down
Broke my heart so I broke her face
Ain't no way around it
I can be your master

There's something in your eyes
I don't wanna see
'Cause you're electric Suzy
And you're mine
'Til the end of the time
Right 'til the end of the time
To the end of the time, time, time
You electrifies me, bitch

Baby, baby, I got something to tell
Little Suzy won't you come down
You broke my heart so I ripped her's out
Ain't no way around it
I can be your master

There's something in your eyes
I don't wanna see
'Cause you're electric Suzy
And you're mine
'Til the end of the time
Right 'til the end of the time
Right 'til the end of the time, time, time
Wanna crucify me

'Til the end of the time
'Til the end of the time
'Til the end of the time, time, time
You electrifies me, baby

'Til the end of the time, baby
'Til the end of the time, baby
Time, time, baby

'Til the end of the time
Just electric Suzy
Alright, alright now, baby

'Til the end of the time
She's a really mean, mean, mean girl
I said, little Suzy won't you
I said, ride on
Come on, come on, come on
Shake it, shake it, shake it, baby
