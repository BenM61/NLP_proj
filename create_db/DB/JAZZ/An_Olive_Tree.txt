One day, while in the south of France,
My good friend said I should hug an olive tree,
She claimed that dreams come true when you do, but
Can a plant be in any way that beneficial to me?
 
Though I'm a famous skeptic, feet on the ground,
This time I wanted this to be true
Now picture this
A silly polish girl in nice
Embracing trees
Wishing for you
 
Hug an olive tree
I take it things are looking good
Still--could be better,
There's always something to improve
And so you should
Hug an olive tree
I take it things are looking good
Still, could be better,
There's always something to improve
Oh yes we should
 
So when you're in the south of France
And you've got dreams,
Look for some magic gardens with olive trees
 
Though I'm a famous skeptic, feet on the ground,
This time I wanted this to be true...
Some olive branch must have heard my desperate heart
'cause I wear the crown (the olive crown,
I wear the olive crown)
And so do you
