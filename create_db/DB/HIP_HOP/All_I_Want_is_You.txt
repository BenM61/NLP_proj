Damn cold world
I never thought I see that day that you my old girl
Now I'm stuck here hollering at old girl
Got one, got two three four girls
Shotgun in the drop made a right
Hut one hut two told them hoes take a hike
Then it's on to the next one on on to the next one
Hard to move on when you always regret one

I wonder sometimes.
I wonder if I, was wrong
Tryna do right by you got me here
Now all I am is alone

'Cause her eyes
Those hips
And that ass
Don't compare at all, no
And at best all they do is distract me but now
Deep down when I face it

All I want is you
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now
Now that you're gone, gone, gone

'Cause being your friend
Is killing me softly
Hear voices
Wonder where I went wrong
It was my fault
And the wrong time
I wonder so often
Regret gets exhausting

'Cause her eyes
Those hips
And that ass
Don't compare at all, no
And at best all they do is distract me but now
Deep down when I face it

All I want is you
All I want is you now
All I want is you now
Sugar now that you're gone, gone, gone

All I want is you
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now
Baby now that you're gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

'Cause they don't smile or smell like you
'Cause they don't make me laugh or even cook like you
'Cause they don't photograph nah they don't sex like you
Lets face it I can't replace it
That's why all I want is you now

I hit the club when you left me thinking that could heal shit
Trying to celebrate my "Independence Day" Will Smith
Baby girl who I'm kidding
Still sick real shit
All my new hoes seem to get old real quick
And could it be,
you everything that these plain bitches couldn't be
Is it a sign from the Lord that I shouldn't be
Lost in the player way sorta get old to me
Got me on layaway, girl you gotta a hold on me
I say I'm wrong, you say come again
Damn said I was wrong look don't rub it in
I got a lot on my mind
Got a flock full of dimes
Like a line full of hoes,
How they coming in
Just saying
Don't wanna have me then somebody will
I'm playing
Weight on my chest like I body build
I'm praying
You ain't content with trying to do your thang
And come back baby boomerang, rang

That's why
All I want is you now
All I want is you now
All I want is you now
Sugar now that you're gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

You know that you're gone, gone, gone
I want you back
