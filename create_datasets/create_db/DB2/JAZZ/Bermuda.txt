Down in Bermuda
Paradise for two
I lost my lover
There on the blue

We went sailing
On a coral sea
Starlit waters
My darling and me

Time was endless
Love sang its song
We dreamed of tomorrow
Now he is gone

I see his lips
In the coral
I see his eyes
In the water blue
I see his hair
In the glowing sunlight
A vision clear
Calling me near

In Bermudan waters
Oh, so clear and cold
I await my loved one
As I grow old

I await my loved one
As I grow old
