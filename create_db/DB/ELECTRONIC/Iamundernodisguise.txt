I am neither breather, nor speaker
I am neither walker, nor sleeper
I am neither sister, brother, son, nor daughter
Solely in my chest is my heart, a drum of water

I am under no disguise
I am under no disguise
I am under no disguise
I am under no disguise

I am under no disguise
I am under no disguise
I am under no disguise
I am under no disguise

I am neither breather, nor speaker
I am neither walker, nor sleeper
I am neither sister, brother, son, nor daughter
Solely in my chest is my heart, a drum of water
