A summerhouse in Texas 
Searching for Siberia 
Pioneering underground 
We looked a lot like you 
Now work is done, the table set 
Deliver insufficient sound 

Oh my, fall in love with me 
Oh my, fall in love with me 

Cross military lines 
Nobody would believe us now 
The weather working with us 
We looked a lot like you 
Now every boy's a refugee 
Living for the moment 

Through the shrieking wails
Trans-European overseas
Silently leaving Amsterdam
We looked a lot like you
Shy away from standard life
Each bitter moment lingers on
