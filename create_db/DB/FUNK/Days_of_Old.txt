Way back yonder in the days of old
The men was working but not saving any dough
Then came a woman looking real cool
She said to herself, "now that's my fool"

I'm gonna ball tonight
I'm gonna ball tonight
Well, I can't break the rule because
Every man is some woman's fool

I met a girl on the avenue
She was sharp and I was blue
Like a teacher and a student in the school
She looked at me and said, "you're my fool"

I'm gonna ball tonight
Yes, I'm gonna ball tonight
Well, I can't break the rule because
Every man is some woman's fool

Way back yonder in the days of old
The men was working but not saving any dough
Then came a woman looking real cool
She began then to play every man for a fool

I'm gonna ball tonight
Yes, I'm gonna ball tonight
Well, there's no use to break the rules because
Every man is some woman's fool

Yeah, I'm gonna ball tonight
We're gonna ball tonight
We're gonna ball tonight
I'm gonna ball tonight
Well, there's no use to break the rules because
Every man is some woman's fool
