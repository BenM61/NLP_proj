You flick your mane and click your fingers again
And from your back you call my name
And like a fool I run right back to you
And dance along to your latest tune

And when the lands slides
And when the planets die
That's when I come back
When I come back to you

And when the sun cools
And when the stars fall
That's when I come back
When I come back to you

You roll those eyes and trap my hand in your thighs
It's slavery but in disguise
And like a fool I run right back to you
There's nothing else that I can do

And when the pigs fly
And when the planets die
That's when I come back
When I come back to you

And when the sun cools
And when the stars fall
That's when I come back
When I come back to you

And when the war machines
Rust eternally
That's when I come back
When I come back to you

And when your heart bleeds
For a love that's dead like me
That's when I come back
When I come back to you
