I can't use what I can't abuse
And I can't stop when it comes to you
You burned me out but I'm back at your door
Like Joan of Arc coming  ack for more

I nearly died
I nearly died
I nearly died
I came to cut you up, I came to knock you down
I came around to tear your little world apart
I came to shut you up, I came to drag you down
I came around to tear your little world apart and break your soul apart

Ah, you burn and burn to get under my skin
You've gone too far now I won't give in
You crucified me but I'm back in your bed
like Jesus Christ coming back from the dead

I nearly died
I nearly died
I nearly died
I came to knock you up, I came to cut you down
I came around to tear your little world apart
I came to rock you up, I came to shout you down
I came around to tear your little world apart and break your soul apart

I nearly died
I nearly died
I nearly died
I came to cut you up, I came to knock you down
I came around to tear your little world apart
I came to shut you up, I came to suck you down
I came around to tear your little world apart

Tear your little world apart
Tear your little world apart and break your soul apart
I can't stop when it comes to you
I can't stop when it comes to you
When it comes to you
When it comes to you
