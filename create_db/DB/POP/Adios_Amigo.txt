Adios amigo, adios my friend
The road we have travelled has come to an end
When two love the same love, one love has to lose
And it's you who she longs for, it's you she will choose

Adios compadre, what must be must be
Remember to name one muchacho for me
I ride to the Rio, where my life I must spend
Adios amigo, adios my friend

Adios compadre, let us shed no tears
May all your ma√±anas bring joy through the years
Away from these memories, my life I must spend
Adios amigo, adios my friend
