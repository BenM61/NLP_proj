You said you needed time to think it over
You said I was too young for you to care
You wanted me to wait till you were sober
Before you said the things you didn't dare

Well I been growing for so long
That I could teach you in a song
Ageless minds attract each other
Learn from love and not from numbers
Think it over
Think it over

Doo doo doo doo doo 
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

I been open to your love for ages
But you can't see the forest for the trees
You treat me like I'm just your little angel
But I'm a woman wanting you to see
That I been growing for so long
That I could teach you in a song
Ageless minds attract each other 
Learn from love and not from numbers
Think it over 
Think it over

You keep your love from me for sake of others
And what we have is nothing for ourselves
The consciousness to be eternal lovers
Is something that you can't deny yourself
'Cause I been waiting for so long
To try and hold you 

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Think it over, over doo doo
