I'm not gonna sleep tonight
Till the morning fills the sky
No one's getting left behind, this is our time
This is our time

We're gonna live this night, yeah
Live it like it's our last night
'Cause nobody cares
If there's no tomorrow

I'm not thinking 'bout the future (the future)
It's somewhere out there
We're all busy being human
We remember
Hearts spinning all around me (together)
Now, they're surrounding me
This is how we get connected
Running out the shadows into light

We're gonna live this night, yeah
Live it like it's our last night
'Cause nobody cares
If there's no tomorrow

We're gonna love this night, yeah
Loving like it's our last night
Stars up in the air, yeah
It's our last night in the city

I've been traveling around now
(Big world with my brothers)
Always moving to a new town
No time to put the roofs down
We can't stop believing (can't stop)
Now we believe in you
'Cause when you're standing in the spotlights
The only thing that matters is tonight

We're gonna live this night, yeah
Live it like it's our last night
'Cause nobody cares
If there's no tomorrow

We're gonna love this night, yeah
Loving like it's our last night
Stars up in the air, yeah
It's our last night in the city

(Yeah) yeah
Last night in the city
(Yeah) yeah
Last night in the city

I'm not gonna sleep tonight
Till the morning fills the sky
No one's getting left behind, this is our time
This is our time

We're gonna live this night, yeah
Live it like it's our last night
'Cause nobody cares
If there's no tomorrow

We're gonna love this night, yeah
Loving like it's our last night
Stars up in the air, oh yeah
It's our last night in the city

(Yeah) yeah
Last night in the city
(Yeah) yeah
Last night in the city
