When I look into your eyes,
I can see what's on your mind,
'cause baby, I'm good at understanding.
It's alright to make mistakes,
To hide what's deep inside,
But babe, I'm never too demanding.

You know I will listen,
You know I will never judge,
Although there are preaches,
That maybe right or wrong,
Some things cannot be undone.

I don't care about my number,
On your list of lovers,
I'm to love you now.
I don't care about the others,
On your list of lovers,
It's too long to bother me-
Anyhow, anyway, anymore.

We were captured in between,
These valant calm estates,
And nothing seems like we planned.
But those are fears that are unknown,
Will stand pn their own,
So don't be afraid, to take my hand.

You, are my angel,
A soul with your wings of gold,
I'm the one to feel you breathe,
I'm the one to touch your face,
And boy, you're mine to embrace.

I don't care about my number,
On your list of lovers,
I'm to love you now.
I don't care about the others,
On your list of lovers,
It's too long to bother me-
Anyhow, anyway, anymore.

The word is spreading fast that I'm with you,
There about the girls that you've been through,
You know my love is real,
Just be careful it's my precious heart you steal

I don't care about my number,
On your list of lovers,
I'm to love you now.
I don't care about the others,
On your list of lovers,
It's too long to bother me.

I don't care about my number,
On your list of lovers,
I'm to love you now.
I don't care about the others,
On your list of lovers,
It's too long to bother me-
Anyhow, anyway, anymore.
