Where did it go to, my youth?
Where did it fade away to?
Who was it told the truth, the bitter truth,
The truth we didn't want to know?

What is it, do you know?
What is it, can I bear it?
Who did it, do I care?
Who is it, when did it happen, and where?

Why did you let me know?
How could you think I'd stand it?
You knew I'd pay you back.
I did it, and it happened, do you care?
Where did it go to, my youth?
Where did it fade away to?
Who was it told the truth, the bitter truth

The truth we didn't want to know?
Who is he, do you know?
This man of power but a fool.
They said he was so high and pure.
They also said that he was cruel.
They killed him, did you see?

They knew he couldn't take it.
They wanted lies, he said the truth.
They did it, and it happened, who cares?
Where did it go to, my youth?
Where did it slip away to?
Who was it told the truth, the bitter truth

The truth we didn't want to know?
Why did you let me know?
How could you think I'd stand it?
You knew I'd pay you back.
I did it, and it happened, do you care?

What is it, do you know?
Who did it, can I bear it?
Who did it, do I care?
Who is it, when did it happen, and where?

What is it, do you know?
Who did it, can I bear it?
Who did it, do I care?
Who is it, when did it happen, and where?

Where did it go to, my youth?
Where did it slip away to?
Who was it told the truth, the bitter truth
The truth we didn't want to know?
