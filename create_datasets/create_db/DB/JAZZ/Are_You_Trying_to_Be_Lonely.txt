You're the first thought in my mind 
But you still don't treat me right 
You're putting hot knives in my heart 
Your cold stabs are tearing me apart 

But I'm trying to love you 
There's no one above you 
But you make it so hard 
All I want to do is kick in my heart 

Are you trying to be lonely 
Well, it's working for you 
Are you trying to be lonely 
What are you trying to prove 

Each night I say my prayers 
Hoping that you'll change 
Every time I see you out 
I catch you there with another man 

We could go through this heartache 
We can go through this pain 
But what good will the torture do you 
And what exactly are you trying to gain 

Are you trying to be lonely, oh girl 
Are you trying to be lonely 

And I'm trying to love you 
There's no one above you 
But you make it so hard 
All I want to do is kick in my heart girl 

Are you trying to be lonely 
Well, it's working for you 
Are you trying to be lonely 
That's what you wanna, that's what you wanna do 

Are you trying to be lonely 
I'm tired of being lonely too 
Are you trying to be lonely 
What are you trying to prove 

Are you trying to be lonely
