Blue light of morning palm trees in rows 
The end of my affair with the west coast
I was already dressed when she opened her mouth 
And decided to give up the ghost 
Helicopters the coast guard and radar screens 
All the haunted and lonely technology 
I'll cut all my times with the dead and the dying 
I have been wasting my time
In need of a substance to steady my hands
I'm gonna make the most of this day's plans 
Falling in love with the shivering engines 
Falling in love with the prettiest sound 

I'm on your side
Behind the front lines 

A tear in the fabric that no one could see 
But your heart was always unraveling 
I gathered the twine as it trailed from behind 
And collected it all in my coat
The Pacific Ocean you claim as your own 
The vineyard the graveyard the grapes and the bones
Falling in love with the weight of the water 
Falling in love with the taste of the ghost 

I'm on your side 
Behind the front lines 

On drugs in the dark with the one I love 
That my friends is where I wish I was
Tied up in twine with the dead and the dying 
And dragging back home under her control
She's looking for someone to settle her debts 
And I always settle for the silhouettes
Falling in love with some back lighted stranger
Falling in love and going into the red 

I'm on your side
Behind the front lines
