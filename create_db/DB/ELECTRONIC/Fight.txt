You you promised us hope
You gave us a dream
You promised us lies
Now you you've taken it all
You've taken our lives
And thrown them away

Fight fight for your lives
Fight fight to be free, yeah
Death to them all, the liars and cheats
Fight to kill them all

They, they think that they're right
They think they're supreme
They're too blind to see
Now we we rise to the call
Stand 'til we fall
Broken and weak
