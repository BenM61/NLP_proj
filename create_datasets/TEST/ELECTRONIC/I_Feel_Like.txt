So much here to lean on 
So much loneliness to lose 
And when we stumble 
We'll have each other 
So all we have to do is choose 

We're gonna see 
That we can feel 
We're gonna fly 
This time love can be real 

As we look into the future 
And we celebrate the past 
It's more than now, it's forever 
I know this love is meant to last 

We're gonna see 
That we can feel 
We're gonna fly 
This time love can be real
