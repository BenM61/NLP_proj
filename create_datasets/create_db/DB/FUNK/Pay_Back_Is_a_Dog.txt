By mistake I heard
Some news about you
I just turned my head
And closed my ears
It hurts so bad

First I tried to look
I paused a moment
Just to catch my breath
Until I saw how big a fool I was

To love you so
The way (Incomprehensible)
I had no where to go

Remember when I told you
Not long ago
If you wanted somebody new
To make me know

One day you know
Just how it feels

Pay back is a dog
Dog, it's a dog
Pay back is a dog
Dog, it's a dog

Pay back is a dog
Dog, it's a dog
Pay back is a dog

It seems like only yesterday
We chased a rainbow
Now our pot of gold
Has turned to worthless, useless simple tune

It was just a dream
And I just woke up
I don't have anything

Now you seem to act so strange
I told you so
Only got yourself to blame
Wanna let you know

One day you'll see
Just how it feels

Pay back is a dog
Dog, it's a dog
Pay back is a dog
Dog, it's a dog

Pay back is a dog
Dog, it's a dog
Pay back is a dog
Dog, it's a dog

Pay back is a dog
Dog, it's a dog
Pay back is a dog
Dog, it's a dog
