When you hide next to me
With your eyes up close to me
I hear footsteps in the dark
When you hijack my heart

Cool breeze down the hall
I can feel you breathe outside my door

Bang, bang, bang on the wall
From dusk 'til dawn
Do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do

Bang, bang, bang on the wall
From dusk 'til dawn
Do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do

Bang, bang, bang on the wall
From dusk 'til dawn

When you sense you're not alone
And the darkness starts to moan who's there?

Shadows all around
But you don't make a sound
Voices in my head
Playing like an echo, echo

Bang, bang, bang on the wall
From dusk 'til dawn
Do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do
