Hundred and one in the shade tonight
All that time in the wilds of youth
You might find it won't desert you
We're gonna shake your soul tonight

Some may say let's wait and see
Some may find it's a mystery
Blame it on love on the ones unsung
We'll take care of the damage done

Sons beat down, sons beat down
Sons beat down, daughters and sons

Who are those too afraid to awaken
So her hand falls on his face
Many are those too afraid to be shaken
Sit in darkness somewhere safe
 
Some of those things you'll never see
Some of those things you may never be
But you won't try, and you won't know
Maybe it's time for letting it go

Sons beat down, sons beat down
Sons beat down, sons beat down

This world's fast and it's bloody uncertain
Generations walk in their own light
We'll play for the ones until the last curtain
In rage against the dark of night

Sons beat down, sons beat down
Sons beat down, sons beat down
