See the dark night has come down on us
The world is livin' in its dream
But now we know that we can wake up from this sleep
And set out on the journey
Find a ship to take us on the way.

The time has come to trust that guiding light
And leavin' all the rest behind
We'll take the road that leads down to the waterside
And set out on the journey
Find a ship to take us on the way.

And we'll sail out on the water
Yes we'll feel the seas roll
Yes we'll meet out on the water
Where are all strangers are known.

If you travel blindly, if you fall
The truth is there to set you free
And when your heart can see just one thing in this life
We'll set out on the journey
Find a ship to take us on the way.

And we'll sail out on the water
Yes we'll feel the seas roll
Yes we'll meet out on the water
Where are all strangers are known.

See the dark night has come down on us
The world is livin' in its dream
But now we know that we can wake up from this sleep
And set out on the journey
Find a ship to take us on the way.

And we'll sail out on the water
Yes we'll feel the seas roll
Yes we'll meet out on the water
Where are all strangers are known.
