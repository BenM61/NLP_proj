Now I told you a long time ago, that I'd hold you
Never let you go behind
Anywhere I might flow

And I know you believe in me
And I hope you are seeing my dream
A whole lot of people in this world
Is a running around

And it's a long way in the face of fear
And there's a lot of men left without any tears
Anymore

And money is the name in the game of fame
But the music don't come out quite the same
Anymore

It's all about a bright white light
Shining through your mind and guiding your way
Mama, put your arms around me
Fill me with your joy and rock me tonight
I said, bright white light
Shining through your mind and guiding your way

I told you a long time ago, that I'd hold you
Never let you go behind
Anywhere I might flow

And I'll hold you in winter and spring
And behold you in everything I sing
Being in your arms is just like coming home

And it's a long way in the face of fear
And there's a lot of men left without any tears
Anymore

And money is the name in the game of fame
But the music don't come out quite the same
Anymore

It's all about a bright white light
Shining through your mind and guiding your way
Bright white light
Shining through your mind and guiding your way
Mama, put your arms around me

Fill me with your joy and rock me tonight
I said, bright white light
Shining through your mind and guiding your way
Bright white light

Shining through your mind and guiding your way
Bright white light
Shining through your mind and guiding your way
Bright white light
Shining through your mind and guiding your way
