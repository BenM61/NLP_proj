Asked my girl, do you want to be free
She said, baby, stay close to me
I asked my girl what'cha thinkin' of
She said, ain't nothin' better, better than love

Lorraine, some things never change
Lorraine, she'll always be the same

And I'll keep on lovin' Lorraine
I got a job on a rig overseas
Lorraine, will you wait for me?
She's been waiting for a long time
Yeah, she's been waiting for a very long time

Lorraine, some things never change
Lorraine, she'll always be the same

The candles burnin' baby
I'll be returnin' baby
Back to you
Back to you

Lorraine, some things never change
Lorraine, she'll always be the same
