I used to think I hated everything about school
Now when I think back, it was actually kinda cool
Standing alone in the crowd, when I saw your face 
Remembering twilight days and making love hearts with our converse lace

Live for the moment, live for today
You've come so far to say that you are fine again
Live for the moment, live for today
We've come so far from yesterday
And these are better times

Just take me away into euphoria
Where we will stay with the things we prefer
Night after night and day after day
With all of these heights we're changing, with all of these heights, we're changing our ways.

Live for the moment, live for today
You've come so far to say that you are fine again
Live for the moment, live for today
We've come so far from yesterday
And these are better times

It's weird to think that this was just an excuse to see each other but now we can meet any time we like. 
So come out to see me, come out to see me, any time of the night, to be someone new this year, a step forward out of here. 

It's weird to think that this was just an excuse to see each other but now we can meet, any time we like. 
So come out to see me come out to see me, any time of the night. 
With all of our broken pasts, I think we're going to last this time. 

You've got something to say again, haven't you? 
We've got a place to stay now, and it's got the best view. 
So come around, and let me know, is it me that you still think of? 
When you wake up to the sound of the stereo. 

Live for the moment, live for today
You've come so far to say that you are fine again
Live for the moment, live for today
We've come so far from yesterday
And these are better times

Woah this is our training ground
Woah this is our training ground
