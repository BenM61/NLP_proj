What can I say?
When you think you've had enough,
And there's no more game to play

If you're feelin' life just passed you by,
And the story's all the same.
If the little lies that you tell each night,
Don't impress, then  you need to change.

Well its all right here in the game,
Can you see yourself fall in and out of love
Its always the same
Can you be yourself and give it up for love.

Well no one can blame,
If you're feelin' out of touch,
While your dreams all slip away.

If your feelin' tired of the bumpy ride
And the roads all lead you away,
From the city life and the phony smiles,
Don't forget, your home's where you stay.

But its all just part of the game
Where you see your self go, in and out of love,
You're always the same
Can you free yourself and live enough for us?

Well its all right here in the game,
Can you see yourself fall in and out of love,
Its always the same
Can you be yourself and give it up for

All just part of the game
Where you see your self go, in and out of love,
You're always the same
Can you free yourself and live enough for

There's a soul here in you and I,
One that can make you fly,
Don't let it pass you by

If you're feelin' its passed you by,
And if you're feelin' tired,
Feelin' the city life

There's a soul here in you and I,
One that can make you fly,
Don't let it pass you by

If you're feelin' its passed you by,
And if you're feelin tired,
Feelin' the city life
