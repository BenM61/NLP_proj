Slower than her but feelin better than usual
And I can only tell you 'being tuned out is beautiful'

Had another day that I fell apart
But that was yesterday, that was yesterday
And I can only feel it when the sun goes down
But it's always down, it's always down

You're even better than depression

Woke up feelin slower than the season before
But that was yesterday, that was yesterday
And you keep me goin while the

Feels even better than depression
