Open baby, you've left me,
Open now, I'm shattered into a million pieces.
Can't stop looking over my shoulder,
Just incase you realise just how much you want this.
The longer, the sweeter, baby don't stop.
It's ok cause I'm down for you.
Not gonna stop till you tell me to.
I'm into you like a bad ass too.
Tell me how did this happen,
I've never known or what to do.

Oh oh oh. 

* I've never felt like this before
Can't say that you don't make me hot,
I want to tell ma what you got babe.
I've never felt like this before,
I'm lovin every minute of it don't stop.
You are all I ever want. *

Empty standing, where you've left me,
Cold boy now I'm frozen, by a kiss from your lips.
Your heart tells me that you're open,
Melted by the answers, I've been waiting to hear.
And now that you've told me boy I can't stop.
In a flash I'm all over you.
I couldn't stop if you told me to.
I'm into you like a bad ass too.
Tell me how did this happen,
I've never known or what to do.

Oh oh oh.


Can't hold this down or be cool,
Now playing my heart, 
Now I'd like, I'm feeling you.
So I just get down to the truth, 
Can nobody do to me baby like you do.
