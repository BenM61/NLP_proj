Ho-ly God, we praise Thy Name; 
Lord of all, we bow be-fore Thee!
All on earth Thy scep-ter claim, 
All in heav-en a-bove a-dore Thee;
In-fin-ite Thy vast do-main, 
Ev-er-last-ing is Thy reign. 

Hark! the loud ce-les-tial hymn 
An-gel choirs a-bove are rais-ing,
Cher-you-bim and ser-a-phim, 
In un-ceas-ing chor-us prais-ing;
Fill the heav-ens with sweet ac-cord: 
Ho-ly, ho-ly, ho-ly, Lord. 

Lo! the a-pos-tol-ic train 
Join the sa-cred Name to hal-low;
Pro-phets swell the loud re-frain, 
And the white-robed mar-tyrs fol-low;
And from morn to set of sun, 
Through the Church the song goes on. 

Ho-ly Fa-ther, Ho-ly Son, 
Ho-ly Spir-it, Three we name Thee;
While in es-sense on-ly One, 
Un-di-vid-ed God we claim Thee;
And a-dor-ing bend the knee, 
While we own the mys-ter-y.
