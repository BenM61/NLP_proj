Go down the back roads, don't take it too slow
You don't have the time for a long flirtation
You don't have the time for the least hesitation

Roses all are blooming
Lilacs all aglow
Honeysuckle vine shine, shine
Oh, get out, oh, get out of your house

Springtime, springtime can kill you
Just like it did poor me
Don't you see we're all hurt the same way
So get out, so get out of your house

High on the moonshine bodies entwine
Don't you see, it's better this way
Don't you see, it's better this way

You can't be too shy
You know the reason why
If you don't go get what you need
Something's going to break on the inside

Springtime, springtime can kill you
Just like it did poor me
Don't you see we're all hurt the same way
So get out, get out of your house
