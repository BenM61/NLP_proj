Call me special, stickman stencil, thin like pencil
I've got a thumb so I can pick up and use them utensils
My credential? I'm prehensile 
And I may be standing still but my energy has potential
Boom! We explode like the Hedgehog sonically
Dooma to the goomba when we jump Marionically
It's ethereal....I'm immaterial 
Some day may face will be seen on a box of cereal
I ride with the pride of the lion on the main
But you can only know me as I exist upon this plane
All the same, what's my name? You must be joking
Upon the pain of death can my true name be spoken
In the morning I storm in and swarm without warning
Shift shape and rise like the Phoenix from the flame
I reign colossal, fueled like fossil
Doing the impossible, raising dead as we spread the gospel
Of the skinnee to the many it's a J day
Your whack tactics lack it so just pack it like a K-way 
J's intended to be splendid when we send it
Rip shit up and then we mend it 
A word to the skeptics and the cynical 
We're the ones who showed Him how to make a miracle
Before you make a scene saying we blaspheme, cut the fuss
Take a good look at the good book, that was Us
From the top of the zenith we're the pinnacle
For the squeamish any skirmish is unwinnable
As we travel like Odysseus through the universe
Alerting we be certain that we're converting Earth first

Power might, glory omnipotence 
With my hands behind my back I still control all of the elements
We're heaven sent so we rule all creation
All that's evil runs before me wailing lamentations 
Blink and you missed it, The futuristic existence
From another plane I came and it'll never be the same
Naw it's better, Hail the nappy head
Incision with precision and I'm skinnee like stiletto 
I behead a killer-stare, serpent haired medusa
Refusing to give in cause I'm living like Methuselah 
Fighting off your evil as your mental's getting feeble
Gobble all your kibble and you wobble like a weeble
Just chill, skinnee j's raise the upheaval
Missed it on the first time round, catch the sequel
Return of the new and improved and I'm smooth
Ain't nobody does it better, here's the proof
