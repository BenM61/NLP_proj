I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream
To follow where you'll be

And I'm wishing on all the rainbows that I see
Wishing on all the people who've, ever been
And I'm wishing on tomorrow, when will it come
And I'm wishing on all the lovin' we've ever done

I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I never thought I'd see
A time when you would be
So far away from home
So far away from me

Just think of all the moments, that we'd spent
I just can't let you go from me, you were meant
And I didn't mean to hurt you, but I know
That in the game of lovin' you, I was slow,

I feel it's time for us to make up, baby
I feel it's time for us to get back together
And make the best of things, oh, baby
When we're together, whether or never

I feel it's time for us to make up, baby
I feel it's time for us to get back together
And make the best of things, oh baby
When we're together, yeah whether or never,

And I'm wishing on a star

And I'm wishing on all the rainbows that I see
Wishing on all the people who've ever been
Wishing on tomorrow, when will it come
I'm wishing on all the lovin' we've ever done

But I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream
To follow where you been
Said I'm wishing on a star
