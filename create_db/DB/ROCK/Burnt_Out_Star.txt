She was looking forward to some time without a guy
Scattered small, shitty hair, but so am I
I grew up in Derby and you grew up way too fast
Death haunts the past, you just wanna lie on the grass
I can wait a while, I can wait a while

Burnt out star (burnt out star)
No matter where you are (you are)
Try to understand
That you're only a man

Oh, perfect body that they'll never tear apart
First they'll have to tear my head from your heart
She said it'd be romantic if I didn't use the door
Safe to say I don't see windows the same no more
I can wait a while, I can wait a while, yeah

Burnt out star (burnt out star)
No matter where you are (you are)
Try to understand
That you're only a man

Well, I might, I might go and shack up in Tasmania
Before the ozone goes and paradise burns in Australia
Who knows? Who?

1917, 3017
1917, 1-9-1-7
1917, and I couldn't have known
And I couldn't have known, hey
1917, 1917
I can sit down on Jakarta, Jakarta streets
Jakarta street
No, woo, hey
Jakarta
Oh, 1917
Remember 1917
I can sit down on Jakarta
I can sit down on Jakarta streets
Hey, seems like... it hard
Old lady with bad feet, yeah
Wishing that you were high
Rain is getting hard but it doesn't fall
Doesn't fall so hard, hard, hard, hard, hard
Remember 1917, 1917, 1917
Remember, woo
Sit down on Jakarta
Break, break, break it down
And the rain is getting hard
Ha-ha-ha-ha-hard, woo
Sit down on Jakarta
Sit down on Jakarta
Yeah, 1917, 1917
1-9-1-7, 1-9-1-7
1-9-1-7, 1-9-1-7
1917
Sit down on Jakarta, woo
1917, 1917, 1917, 1917
1917, 1917, 1917, 1917
Wishing that you were high
Rain is getting hard but it doesn't fall as far on me
Yeah, it's 1917, 1917
