Every time I close my eyes
I can clearly see the image of your smile 
Shining through my darkest dreams 
 
I never thought I'd find my self this close
This close to you my dea
Tell me what it means (got to have your love)

I can feel your sweet caress
Wash away all the loneliness that I once felt
Inside my heart, oh yeah
Boy if you can read my mind 
I'm sure that you could find
What you've been searching for
What you've been searching for

(Bring from dismay, there's so much to share)
If you surrender to me, whoa yeah!
(Whisper in my ears, words I long to hear)
Ooo-ooo-ooo,yeah!
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
Boy I got to have your love
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
You know, you know, you know I need your love
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
Boy I got to have your love
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
You know, you know, you know I need your love

Yeah!
Listen up
It's like this
You're like an angel in disguise
I feel like I'm in heaven when you walk my way
You're such a mystery
(Such a mystery)

Butterflies I feel inside must be
(Must be)
Must be
(Must be)
A sign of love
No one can disagree
My desire for your love
Is like a new horizon only lovers see
Like you and I
The signal that will be the start
To synchronize our hearts
I love ya till my dying day
Until my dying day-ay!

(Bring from dismay, there's so much to share)
If you surrender to me!
(Whisper in my ears, words I long to hear)
Ooo-ooo-ooo
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
Boy I got to have your love.
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
You know, you know, you know I need your love
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
Boy I got to have your love
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
You know I need your love
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
Boy I got to have your love
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
You know I need your love
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
Boy I got to have your love
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
