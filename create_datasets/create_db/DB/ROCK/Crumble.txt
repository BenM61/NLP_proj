I got nothing where I've been
Will you bring me there again?
No one ever understands
You won't change to help

I got lost inside a lie
Every smile, you made it die
I'm not real and you know why
Can I run again some more

Can I be there all the time
Can I stop the wondering why
Will I crumble, will I fly
And I've got to make you

Will I be in time to see
Will it roll all over to me
Can I fake it just to be
You know I can't take you on
On

Built a picture yesterday
Built a picture of a moment my love
My love
My love
My love

You have time for me again
But you flatten me instead
Try to be the things your said
Like I almost had it

But I don't ever have it all
And I'm sweating trying to stall
Til I think I heard a call
But you're just laughing along
On
On
On

Built a picture yesterday
Built a picture of a moment my love
My love
My love
My love
