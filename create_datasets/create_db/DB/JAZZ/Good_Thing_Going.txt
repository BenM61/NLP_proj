It started out like a song, we started quiet and slow with no surprise,
Then one morning I woke to realize we have a good thing going.
It's not that nothing went wrong, some angry moment of course, but just a few,
And only moments no more because we knew we had a good thing going.

And if I wanted too much, was that such a mistake?
Half the time you never wanted enough, oh wake up, I don't make that a crime,
And while it's going along, you take for granted some love will wear away,
We took for granted a lot, and still I say, it could have kept on growing,
Instead of just kept on, we had a good thing going, going, gone.
