I paint my lips red, I turn my own head
Don't need nobody's help, zipping up my own dress
Pay my own tab, with my own cash, unattached
Sometimes the world alone, sounds like a sad song
Why's it gotta be, cause what I really need is a reset
And a deep breath, yeah

I think it's time to take a heart break, out late
Solo on a Saturday night
Going out without a plus one, I'm done
Falling over pickup lines
I'm single for the summer, I won't rebound
One lover to another, or be tied down
I'm sleeping like a queen in a California king I made (I made, I made)
I think it's time to take a heart break
I think it's time to take a heart break

It's just a little phase, give me a little space
You might see through it, but I'm putting on a poker face
Give a love a rest, between my ex, and my next

I think it's time to take a heart break, out late
Solo on a Saturday night
Going out without a plus one, I'm done
Falling over pickup lines
I'm single for the summer, I won't rebound
One lover to another, or be tied down
'Til I'm sleeping like a queen in a California king I made (I made, I made)
I think it's time to take a heart break
I think it's time to take a heart break

Love, I'm over you (love, I'm over you)
It's long overdue
I think it's time to take a heart break (I'm single for the summer, I won't rebound)
I think it's time to take a heart break

I think it's time to take a heart break, out late
Solo on a Saturday night
Going out without a plus one, I'm done
Falling over pickup lines
I'm single for the summer, I won't rebound
One lover to another, or be tied down
'Til I'm sleeping like a queen in a California king I made (I made, I made)
I think it's time to take a heart break
I think it's time to take a heart break
