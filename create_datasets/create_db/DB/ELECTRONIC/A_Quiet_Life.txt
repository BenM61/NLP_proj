Refracted sound, and tracer beam
Sure we all know what this confusion means
Spreading boughs, spreading limbs
A mind enlightened, body flowering

A broken cord, a sharpened knife
Hell all I wanted was a quiet life
Illicit synergy and unfulfilled dreams
As your body hits close to me
Refracted sound, and tracer beam
Sure we all know what this confusion means
Broken boughs, spreading limbs
A mind enlightened blody flowering, hitting

This was meant to be a salvation
I tried to force you away
But I want it so keep on dancing here beside me
As night unfolds into day
