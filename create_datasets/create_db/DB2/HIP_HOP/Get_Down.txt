I will be the one to love and comfort you 
From now until the day I die 
I will take you places that you only think 
About when you're asleep at night 
Let me take the time to understand 
And I will 
Set your spirit free 

If you get down on me 
I'll get down on you 
I will do anything 
That you want me to 
It's a game of give and take 
To make it through 
So if you get down on me 
I'll get down on you tonight 

Nighttime turns to day again 
And you are on my mind 
Winter turns to spring and then 
Life has passed you by 
Right now we are so young and free 
But we're runnin' out of time 
So while we've got each other here 
Let's treat our bodies right 

I want to know exactly what to do, so that 
You'll never get me off of your mind 
Communicate and I'll go under cover, gonna 
Make you come tonight 
Over to my house 

I'm not the type to change your mind 
If you want to take it slow 
No pressure to go all the way 
There are often places we can go 

Anytime is the right time to reveal it, when 
Two people fall as deep as you and me 
I want to know every inch of your body so I 
Can set you spirit free 

I will be the one to love and comfort you 
From now until the day I die 
I will take you places that you only think 
About when you're asleep at night 
If you open up to me I'll make you realize 
The things that you could never see 
Let me take the time to understand and I will 
Set you free
