Gypsy woman told my momma, before I was born 
You got a boy-child comin', gonna be a son-of-a-gun 
Gonna make these pretty women, jump and shout 
And the world will only know, a-what it's all about 

Y'know I'm here 
Everybody knows I'm here 
And I'm the hoochie-coochie man 
Everybody knows I'm here 

On the seventh hour, of the seventh day, 
on the seventh month, the seventh doctor said: 
"He's born for good luck, and I know you see; 
Got seven hundred dollars, and don't you mess with me 

Y'know I'm here 
Everybody knows I'm here 
And I'm the hoochie-coochie man 
Everybody knows I'm here 

Gypsy woman told my momma 
Said "Ooh, what a boy, 
he gonna make so many women, 
jump and shout for joy" 

Y'know I'm here 
Everybody knows I'm here 
And I'm the hoochie-coochie man 
Everybody knows I'm here
