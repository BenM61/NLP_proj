Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
Sweet and lovely
Heaven must have sent him my way

Skies above me
Never were as blue as his eyes
And he loves me
Who would want a sweeter surprise?

When he nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me
Melody haunting me

Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
And he loves me
There is nothing more I can say

When he nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me
Melody haunting me

Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
And he loves me
There is nothing more I can say

There is nothing more I can say
There is nothing more I can say
There is nothing more I can say
There is nothing more I can say
