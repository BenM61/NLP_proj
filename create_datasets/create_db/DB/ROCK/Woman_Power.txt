You've heard of woman nation
Well, that's coming, baby
What we need is the power of trust
It's coming

You've heard of the law of selection
That's how we're gonna do it, baby
We allow men who wanna join us
The rest can just stay by themselves

Two thousand years of male society
Laying fear and tyranny
Seeking grades and money
Clinging to values vain and phony

Do you know that one day you lost your way, man?
Do you know that some day you have to pay, man?
Have you anything to say, man?
Except, "make no mistake about it, I'm the president, you hear"
I wanna make one thing clear, I'm the president, you hear"

You don't hear them singing songs
You don't see them living life
Cause they've got nothing to say
But, "make no mistake about it, I'm the president, you hear'
I wanna make one thing clear, I'm the president, you hear'"

You may be the president now
You may still be a man
But you must also be a human
So open up and join us in living

Coming age of feminine society
We'll regain our human dignity
We'll lay some truth and clarity
And bring back nature's beauty

Every woman has a song to sing
Every woman has a story to tell
Make no mistake about it, brothers
We women have the power to move mountains

Woman power

Did you have to cook the meals?
Did you have to knit?
Did you have to care for life instead of killing?
There's no mistake about it, sisters
We women have the power to change the world
