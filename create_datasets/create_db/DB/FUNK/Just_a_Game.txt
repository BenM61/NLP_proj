If you're not
In love with me
Why do you
Pretend to be
Could it be
It's all just a game
To you

I put all
Of my faith in you
Trying to be
What you wanted
Me to
Still it seems
It's all just a game
To you

I've tried hard
To understand it
I don't know
Whether or not
You planned it
Can't you see
That love is made
For two

If you go
I won't regret
Won't spend time
Trying hard to forget
I'll just know
It was all just a game
To you

I've tried hard
To understand it
Oh no
I don't know
Whether or not
You planned it
Can't you see
That love is made
For two
That love is made
For two
That love is made
For two
But it's all just a game
