What you want, honey, you got it
And what you need, baby, you've got it
All I'm asking
For a little respect when I come home, hey now
Hey hey hey, yeah now

Do me wrong, honey, if you wanna to
You can do me wrong honey, while I'm gone
But all I'm asking
Is for a little respect when I come home, ooh, yeah now
Hey hey hey, yeah now

Hey little girl, you're so sweet, little honey
And I'm about to, just give you all of my money
And all I'm asking, hey
A little respect when I come home, hey hey
Hey hey hey, yeah now

Hey little girl, you're sweeter then honey
And I'm about to give you all of my money
But all I want you to do
Is just give it, give it
Respect when I come home, hey hey now
Hey hey hey, yeah now

Respect is what I want from you
Respect is what I need
Respect is what I want
Respect is what I need

Got to, got to have it
Got to, got to have it
Got to, got to have it
Got to, got to have it

Talkin'
Give us, give us, give us, give us
Give us, give us, give us, give us
Give us, give us some baby, everything I need
