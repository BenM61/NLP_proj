I Know A Tyne Waterfall 
A Magic Little Place 
Where We Can Play Together 
And Watch The Fishes Race 

Children Children Where Are You 
Hiding In The Forest Playing In The Rain 
I Hope You Not Too Far Away 
For Me To See Again 

I Know Where There's A Fairy 
Who Will Invite Us All To Tea 
But She Won't Let Me In Alone 
You'll Have To Come With Me 

Children Children Where Are You 
Hiding In The Forest Playing In The Rain 
I Hope You Not Too Far Away 
For Me To See Again
