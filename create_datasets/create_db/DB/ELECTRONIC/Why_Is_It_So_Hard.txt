Forgive me if I flip my face of passion
It's the only way
Condemn me if I raise my voice in anger
Such a dumb, dumb waste

Why is it so hard?

Better to escape
If only I could teach you

Why is it so hard?

Forgive if my favorite course of action
Is the easy way
Condemn if out of haste I claim, "It's over"
When the doubt remains

Why is it so hard?

Better to escape
If only I could teach you

Why is it so hard?

Sometimes I find
It's better to escape
If only I could teach you

Why is it so hard?
