I said, ah, hip-hop, ah, thanks a lot
Ah, c'mon everybody gimme whatcha got
I'm gonna tell you a little story about the Sugarhill Gang
With the pow pow boogie and a big bang bang
And if you wanna rap to the Sugarhill beat gotta rap in the key of RAP
Now that is over, I'm ready to jam

Want all you people, to clap your hands

We're gonna turn this motha sucka out
To all of you people that are ready to jam
Scream it out and say, I am, I am
Somebody, somebody, now you know you're hot

Ah, see I met this girl and I said to her, "Honey
If you wanna be my baby you got ta gimme money"
Turned around, didn't mean no harm
I knocked her out, with my vicious charm
I said, "No, no, baby, it's not like that
Ya see I'm all about makin' that cold cold cash"
Started jivin' around, started messin' wit her head
And next thing I know she wanted to go to

But to turn me on, you got to be the best
'Cause I'm the Master G, I don't take no mess
Like TNT, I'm dynamite, ya see I rock your body to the early light
And when you wake up in the morning you'll see I'm gone
And check it out girl, you're all alone
'Cause you just been hit by the Capricorn King
I rocked you gentle, I rocked you me
I rocked you in and I rocked you out
You made me scream but I made you shout

Go dang, diddy, dang, didang, didang, diggy, diggy
Dang, diddy, dang, didang, didang, diggy, diggy

And keep keep it on but you don't rush
Ah, let's make this party the real Cold Crush
Let's scream, and let's shout
Ah, let's turn this function out
And keep, keep it on but you don't quit
Let's make the party the sure

Once upon a time not long ago everybody had on their radio
And then the fella came on with a groovy noise
To put the wiggle in the women and girls and boys
The word got around about three cool cats
Who put the foot, back, in the pack
And let me tell you party people just who we be
With the help of Big Bank and the Master G

So get up, throw down, we're funkward bound
Hey, the Sugarhill Gang is in your town
Now, baby doll and all you daddy O's
You better get ready to move your toes
So get up, throwdown, we're funkward bound
Hey, the Sugarhill Gang is in your town
Now, baby doll and all you daddy O's
Scream it out and say yo, hit it

Shake it, but don't break it 'cause I know we can make make it
And if you're ready to party and you're dressed to kill
Somebody say, Sugarhill, Sugarhill, Sugarhill, Sugarhill
Ahh, ahh, and let your worries take a chill pill
You go ahh, ahh, ah, ahh, oh, ooh

Chicka pow
Ha, ha, haa, haa, hoo, hoo
Hey could somebody turn their butt
Shake your body down, chicka pow
A-get, a-get, a-get ready

What you see is what you get and you ain't seen nothin yet
I don't think I'm bad don't box in no karate
Just an MC to put the boogie in your body
Go, back and forth then forth and back
We're the Sugarhill Gang we take no slack
Don't wear diamond rings or drive big cars
But the people just treat us like movie stars

Dang, diddy, dang, didang, didang, diggy, diggy
Dang, diddy, dang, didang, didang, diggy, diggy
