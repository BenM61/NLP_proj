Sorry to hear
She wasn't all she seemed
That she made a fool of you
But while you were crying
You made a fool of me

Sorry to see
How blind someone can be
'Cause she never cared at all
Yet without even trying
You made a fool of me

There is no way for me to hide
The pain inside
A love that fantasy kept alive
I seek the truth but cannot find
I need a way to justify
Why you made a fool of me

Sorry to know
Love was the perfect crime
Caring a waste of time
But while you were crying
You made a fool of me

There is no way for me to hide
The pain inside
A love that fantasy kept alive
I seek the truth but cannot find
I need a way to justify
Why you made a fool of me

Sorry to know
Love was the perfect crime
Caring a waste of time
But while you were crying
You made a fool of me
Without even trying
You made a fool of me
