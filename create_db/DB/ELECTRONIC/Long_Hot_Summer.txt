I know you like to wear my dressing-gown,
When I'm not there.
I guess you like it in my shoes.

Just cause you drive a Maserati 
And the ladies stare
Don't mean you'll go as fast as I do.

I know it's summer in the city 
And the sun is high
But you can play it cool again
Cause boy I seen you disco dancing
With your pants on fire
We need a little tropical rain

So baby, baby
Watch the needle when your heading south
You drive me crazy
Just remember you can burn me out
So get down

It's been a long, hot summer
And it's 95 degrees in the shade
It's only Sunday morning 
And I need that Friday feeling again

You put me in a fever 50 stories high
And suddenly I'm freezing 
And I don't know why
It's been a long, hot summer 
And I'm shaking like a cool lemonade

If you want to get fresh
Get outta my car
Cause the boys up here are going to fast
I'm taking my time now

If you want to fly high
Keep outta the sun
When your fingers start to run
It's no fun
So why don't you climb now

If you want to get fresh
Then take a cold shower
Put your back on ice
Before you turn sour
Nobody can fool me

Now I'm cleaning my head
And dusting my eyes
Every time I feel the temperature rise
I need you to cool me

I'm partied out of house and home
So baby if you fight me 
How you gonna like me

Runnin' down that open road 
So think before you bite me
How you gonna get back home

It's been a long, hot summer
And it's 95 degrees in the shade
It's only Sunday morning 
And I need that Friday feeling again

You put me in a fever 50 stories high
And suddenly I'm freezing 
And I don't know why
It's been a long, hot summer 
And I'm shaking like a cool lemonade

Cause I 
So why do you bite me 
So why do you bite me

A little late to take it slow
But I couldn't wait to party

At the cannon ball 
Not what I wanted
Now I've seen it all
So find me

I've ricochet 
Around the world
Drinking pink champagne
It's easy!
