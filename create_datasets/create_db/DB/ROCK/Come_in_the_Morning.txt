Come in the morning
When the sun is shining
Bring me a dream
With the sun beams climbing

Above my head, yeah
To light another day for me

Stay with me now, tomorrow
Come what may
Girl, come what may

Come in the morning
When most people are sleeping
Drifting in slumber
While others are keepin'

A light burning brightly
Come with me
I'll show you the way
Stay with me now, tomorrow

I'm asking only
Cause if you're lonely
You gotta let me know
Enjoy the wonders
Of life and love
Before you have to go
Let me know

Come on, I need

Stay with me now, tomorrow
Come what may, come what may
Come what may, come what may

Come in the morning
When the sun is shining
Bring me a dream
With the sun beams climbing

Above my head, yeah
To light another day for me!

Stay with me now, tomorrow
Come what may
Girl, come what may

You know I love you (Come what may)
You know that I need you (Come what may)
I don't want nobody else, baby (Come what may)
I don't need nobody, nobody else, baby (Come what may)
I just want your love (Come what may)
