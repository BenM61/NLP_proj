I think I slip the net, 
But I cut myself free, 
I'm not losing yet,
So don't forget me.

I'll say it, replay it, and try tomorrow
I'll say it, replay it, and live with sorrow.

You'd think I learn by now,
There's never an easy way,
I get through somehow, 
I'm on my knees to pray, 

You'd think I learn by now,
There's never an easy way,
I get through somehow, 
I'm on my knees.

I'll admit I'm wrong,
But I'm getting on track,
I've been here too long,
I'm under attack.

I place it, replace it, and try to change,
I place it, replace it, and rearrange.

You'd think I learn by now,
There's never an easy way,
I get through somehow, 
I'm on my knees to pray, 

You'd think I learn by now,
There's never an easy way,
I get through somehow, 
I'm on my knees to pray.

On my knees to pray.

I think I slip the net, 
But I cut myself free, 
I'm not losing yet,
So don't forget me.

I'll say it, replay it, and try tomorrow
I'll say it, replay it, and live with sorrow.

You'd think I learn by now,
There's never an easy way,
I get through somehow, 
I'm on my knees to pray, 

You'd think I learn by now,
There's never an easy way,
I get through somehow, 
I'm on my knees to pray,
I'm on my knees to pray,

On my knees to pray,
On my knees to pray.
