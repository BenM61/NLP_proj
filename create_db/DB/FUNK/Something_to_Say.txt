People come on hear what I say 
We gotta stop with this game
Life is a ride we take it everyday
And now it's time for change
You got your money,you got your pride,
That's everything you need
But I got something deeper inside
And I want give it away

Shame baby what you want are
Change if that's what you want
But I got something to say
Feel what's been goin' on
Your losin' your not so strong
I still got something to say

People I know the things you see on your TV
Tellin' you wise how to live your life how you should be
You got your job,you got yours big cars 
You think that's everything
But I got something deeper inside 
And I want give it away
