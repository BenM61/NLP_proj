Is it come and gone?
Is it long before the spirit shaves his legs?
Is it wrapped in trash, sent back in a sanitation tank?
Is it disinfected, disconnected 'til it grafts some wires?
Is it sped up, spun around brown and yellow in the fires?

What is this town? they said I got no place to be
The money need is taking everything I see
Is it comes in lovely bones that put their shirts on ice?
Is it fireflies that cross out eyes with any spice?
Is it normal, born-again? let the vultures drink and drown
Is it's force from weathers, birds of feathers never found?

What is this town? they said I got no place to be
The money need is taking everything I see
Is it come and gone?

Is it long before the spirit shaves his legs?
What is this town? they said I got no place to be
The money need is taking everything I see
