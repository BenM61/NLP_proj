Look out the window when that rain storm
I let the wind blow up a brain storm
And now I'm wondering
Whether weather like this gets you too

It may go on like this for hours
Too late in fall for April showers
So what we got here, got a thought or two
I need to share with you, here goes

Darling, tell me now
Have I done wrong somehow
That you won't look at me
Need it pointed out
Can't keep my wits about
When you won't look at me

Is there something I oughta know?
You're finding hard to say
Well, there's just a trace
Hiding on your face
And I've learned it that way

Just another soul
That really knows my soul
And you won't look at me
Does that take the prize?
How much I love those eyes
And they won't look at me

Now the rain has gone
But something lingers on
There's certain sadness here
Now that the sky is clear
And it's so, so clear
Yes, it's all so clear to me now

And I can't help but fear
That certain sadness here to stay
