Uh huh, hmm hmm
Gonna get along without you now
Uh huh, hmm hmm
Gonna get along without you now

You told me I was the neatest thing
You even asked me to wear your ring
You ran around with every girl in town
You didn't even care if it got me down

Uh huh, hmm hmm
Gonna get along without you now
Mhm mhm, hmm hmm
Gonna get along without you now

Got along without you before I met you
Gonna get along without you now
Gonna find somebody who is twice as cute
Cause you didn't want me anyhow

You told everybody that we were friends
But this is where our friendship ends
Cause all of a sudden you even changed your tune
You haven't been around since way last June

Uh huh, hmm hmm
Gonna get along without you now
Got along without you before I met you
Gonna get along without you now

So long my honey, goodbye my dear
Gonna get along without you now

Uh huh, hmm hmm
Gonna get along without you now
Got along without you before I met you
Gonna get along without you now

So long my honey, goodbye my dear
Gonna get along without you now
