There's a place where the strange ones go
Where nobody here could know
They look down from the clouds and smile at
Everyone down below
There's a place where the strange ones go
Where nobody here could know
They look down from the underground
At everyone down below

I want to cry for you
I want to die for you
Everybody needs a home
Well, are you strange enough
Are you deranged enough
Every fucker needs a home

There's a place where the strange ones go
Where nobody here could know
They look down from the clouds and smile at
Everyone down below
There's a place where the strange ones go
Where nobody here could know
They look down from the underground
At everyone down below

I want to feel for you
I want to steal for you
Everybody needs a home
Well, are you strange enough
Are you deranged enough
Every fucker needs a home

There's a place where the strange ones go
Where nobody here could know
They look down from the clouds and smile at
Everyone down below
There's a place where the strange ones go
Where nobody here could know
They look down from the underground
At everyone down below

There's a place where the strange ones go
Where nobody here could know

Everyone down below
There's a place where the strange ones go
Where nobody here could know
