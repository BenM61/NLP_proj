Between eight and half past seven
This place is awful quiet 
Have to do my shoppin'
Take care of my diet.
I run around in circles
And never see a soul.

Late at night 
Early in the morning light
You can see
see them all.
Late at night 
Early in the morning light
You can feel
feel them all.

Wonder what they're doing
This hour of the day.
What will be their temper
And what will be their pay

Is there another meeting 'bout
How to change the world?
Late at night
