My body is dissolving
I can taste it in my mouth
(?) revolving
I cant find my way out
It feels like it killed me
My lungs are rearing know
I don't need you to tell me
That it's over know

Yes I feel the pain
I know it might suprise you
That I feel this way
Can you see it in my eyes
To wanna (?)
And the tables turn
There's nothing left for you
To do but, you to do but

Execute me
For you I take a ball
Execute me now
Execute me, execute me
Execute me now
Come a little closer now
I'm ready to take up how
Execute me, execute me, execute me now
Now now now now
Now now now now
Now now now now

I'm six feet under
I dream of sunny skies
But rain and thunder
Keeps messing with my mind
Yes I feel the pain
Cause I can't survive you
I'm not so insane
I'm a hard as memorised you

To wanna (?)
And the tables turn
There's nothing left for you
To do but, you to do but

Execute me
For you I take up how
Execute me now
Execute me, execute me
Execute me now
Come a little closer now
I'm ready to take up how
Execute me, execute me, execute me now
Now now now now
Now now now now
Now now now now

Let me be
Let my senses bleed
There's nothing left to me
So go on

Let me be
Let my senses bleed
There's nothing left to me
So go on

Execute me
For you I take up how
Execute me now
Execute me, execute me
Execute me now
Come a little closer now
I'm ready to take up how
Execute me, execute me, execute me now
Now now now now
Now now now now
Now now now now
