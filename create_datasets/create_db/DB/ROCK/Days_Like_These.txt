The sun was shining
The sky was crying
It just tore apart
And down came the rain

And I was soaking
Yeah I was freezing but,
I was feeling
No kind of pain

Come a fireball
I held it in my hand
You see before you
A man who's known greatness

I had a vision
A revelation
I took a look inside of me
And I am a sensation

Days like these I feel
Like I can change the world
Days like these I feel
Like I can change the world

It's either easy
Or it's impossible
But if you ain't got it
You ain't never gonna get it

Once you find it
You gotta grab it you gotta,
Reach down your own throat
And yank it to the surface

That may be brutal
May be gory
But whatever else it is
It's my story

And I believe it
Yeah, I can see it
I sing it out, shout it out
Gimme death or glory

Days like these I feel
Like I can change the world
Days like these I feel
Like I can change the world

Days like these
Days like these
Do you know I think
I'll move a mountain or two

Days like these
Days like these
Anything you want, you know
I'll get it for you

Whoa

Days like these I feel
Like I can change the world

The sun was shining
I was crying
I saw a thousand people
Singing in the rain

And I was thinking
About the Indians
And how they say, true wisdom
Only comes from pain

Come a rumbling
Humbling feeling
Like things will never
Ever be the same

But what doesn't kill ya
Only makes you stronger
And today I'm strong enough
And anyway, I love the rain

Days like these I feel
Like I can change the world
Days like these I feel
Like I can change the world

Oh on a day like these

Days like these I feel
Like I can change the world
Days like these I feel
Like I can change the world

Ah, change the world

Days like these I feel
Like I can change the world
Days like these I feel
Like I can change the world

Feel I can change the world
