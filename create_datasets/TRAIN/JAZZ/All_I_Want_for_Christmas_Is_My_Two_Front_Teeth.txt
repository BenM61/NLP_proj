'Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse
Suddenly I heard a strange noise down below
So, in my flannel pajamas I went tippy-toe
I could see old Saint Nick from the spot where I stood
So I slid down the banister just as fast as I could 

All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth 
My two front teeth, see, my two front teeth 
Gee, if I could only have my two front teeth 
Then I could wish you Merry Christmas

It seems so long since I could say
Sister, Suzy sitting on a thistle
Every time I try to speak
Huh, all I do is whistle 

All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth
My two front teeth my two front teeth 
Gee, if I could only have my two front teeth 
Then I could wish you Merry Christmas

Good old Santa Claus and all his reindeer
Huh, they used to bring me lots of toys and candy
Gee, but, but now when I go out and call Dancer, Prancer, Donnner and Blitzen
None of 'em can understand me

All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth
My two front teeth, see my two front tee
All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth
So I can wish you merry Christmas
Christmas, Christmas
Aww, for goodness sakes
Happy New Year
