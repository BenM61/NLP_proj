Be careful in life and you'll see
The greedy live off you and me
This is the code, we can break history
But the greedy still fear you and me

So get out the way
People have to work
Not wallow in the dirt
People have to work
I bet that this is as good as it gets, yes

How can you ask for more?
If you're paid, you're not poor
This is as good as it gets, yes
We've been bought, we've been sold

But at least we're not old
When red became blue, hope denied
Our dreams swept away with the tide

So get out the way
People want to work
Not fester in the dirt
We all want to work
I bet that this is as good as it gets, yes

How can you ask for more?
If you're paid, you're not poor
This is as good as it gets, yes
We've been bought, we've been sold

But at least we're not old
Can your heart take the cold?
