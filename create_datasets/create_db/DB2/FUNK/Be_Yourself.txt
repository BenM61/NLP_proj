First you let go
Make believe
Release all your
Woes and be free
From life
Follow your heart to a place that is safe
A way to your soul 
Your own sacred space
And be yourself

Be the moon 
Be the stars
Be whatever you are
Be the right
Be the might 
Be of hope joy and light
But
Be yourself

Take time to know
And to see
Sort through
The past be relieved
Right now
Right now
Let the unknown n take control
Shape your fate
Go with your will 
Cause its never to late
To be
Yourself

Be the moon 
Be the stars
Be whatever you are
Be the right
Be the might 
Be of hope joy and light
But
Be yourself
