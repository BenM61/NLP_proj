I'm all inside out. What's this all about 
You don't want me just I could 
All those crazy days right behind your lace 
Like a shadow of you 

I guess I know by now you really don't want me 
Every time when I see you pass me by 
I could be wrong and all you love me 
Oh-uh-oh, you turn my blue sky black 

Show what can I say if you don't want to stay 
I don't understand why we have to land 
We had so much fun, we're up in the sun 
Oh-you-o, I don't want to come down
