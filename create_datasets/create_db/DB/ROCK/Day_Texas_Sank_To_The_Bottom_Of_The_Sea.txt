Here's all that I have to give
I'll admit it's not a lot,
but it's all that I've got
to hang myself with
in hopes that you'll take notice of me
I've been waiting
so long
up in these trees
trying to hang myselfs with
thoughts of you
thoughts of me
I've been wishing so long
why can't you see?
