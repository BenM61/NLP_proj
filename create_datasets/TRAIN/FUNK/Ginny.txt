Ginny, Ginny, Ginny, Ginny
Ginny, Ginny, Ginny, Ginny
Ginny, Ginny, Ginny, Ginny
 
Oh, Ginny
Please forgive me, oh, Ginny
 
I apologize I'm sorry so sorry
I embarrassed you in front of all the guys
 
Oh, Ginny
I didn't mean it, oh, Ginny
Don't you know I was jealous, so jealous
Cross my heart it wasn't anything I planned
 
When I saw you smile and dance with Ted
Let him take you home is what I said
Tears filled your eyes as I saw you go
 
How I hated myself, Ginny
You'll never know, oh, Ginny
Please forgive me, oh, Ginny
 
Baby, say you will and kiss me, oh kiss me
And say you love me still
Oh, Ginny kiss me, kiss me
And say you love me still
