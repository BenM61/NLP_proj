I promise to wait, my love, right here till you return 
With a love that's weak and a heart that sadly yearns 
Yearns because you've left me all alone and blue 
And to another I know I just can't be true 
I know that you'll come back home 
But hurry up, don't take so long 
'Cause I love you, need you 
Even though you've done me wrong 
I promise to wait, my love, until you finally find 
The love you're sharin' now is not as real as mine 
Her love is like a diamond only worth a dime 
But my love for you is strictly genuine 
I know that you'll come back home 
But hurry up, don't take so long 
'Cause I love you, need you 
Even though you've done me wrong 
How I miss you; I long to hear you call my name 
And since you've been gone, baby, 
You don't think this ain't been the same, no 
I promise to wait, my love, right here till you return 
With arms that want you, baby, & flames that forever burn 
I cry for your tender love & ever-lovin' kiss 
And your tight embrace is what I really miss 
I know that you'll come back home 
But hurry up, don't take so long 
'Cause I love you, need you 
Even though you've done me wrong 
Gonna stay right here, my love; ain't goin' away 
Gonna wait for you, baby
