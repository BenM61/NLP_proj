Half as drunk is twice as clever,
appalled when tarred and feathered.
remarks upon the weather
will just retard endeavour.
this piece of meat is pumping,
poison 'round itself so neatly
about it, pound for pound,
it feeds away and most discreetly.

And all I ask of myself
is that I hold together

Get me divine ascension,
supply my worst intention,
to thrash it out in heave,
our lord - to thick to mention,
this piece of mind is keeping
to itself, if only sleeping.
regard it, freeze it, jar it
assign it all to healing.

And all I ask of myself
is that I hold together
