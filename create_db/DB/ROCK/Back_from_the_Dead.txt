Welcome to my funeral my family and my friends
I hope you've enjoyed the living me because
 the dead one never ends
Your tears of joy are hid by tears of regret
You'll remember my parting ways as the first time
 we really met
You count me out
You'd better have your doubts
Don't let my death go to your head because I'm
BACK FROM THE DEAD
I've always been a loser and settled for second best
Now I've got another chance and I won't fail again
I crash through the window at the will reading party's host
What's the matter dear family? You look like
 you've seen a ghost
No time to run
Not till I've had my fun
This one time you won't forget that I'm
RETURN FROM THE DEAD
Laugh at me - you'll regret
There's no stopping - THE LIVING DEAD
