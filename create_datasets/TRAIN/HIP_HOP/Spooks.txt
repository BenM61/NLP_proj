Spooks is on some other script 
That's why you be lovin' it 
My crew that's the butter clique be glad you discovered it 
Hip hop originals spook rock we runnin' this 
Playin' in the club it hits radio be bumpin' it 

Consensus these cats are forever flippin' hits 
But every time I turn around spooks got to prove this 
Old hits to new hits next hits to crew hits 
You f*ck with it poppin' that nonsense we true to this 

My alternator flow be flippin' radio we done that 
Spooks still spit it for you thugs yeah we done that 
You want it then battle a spook we can't lose for god we fight 
Suffice the plight with the might from piety rights 

Plunge you with lice plead your plight spice for spite 
On judgement night with three strikes 
The wicked is right livin' in trife recite songs 
Repent crimes it's pendulum time 
The comin' of christ for mankind 

Spooks is on some other script 
That's why you be lovin' it 
My crew that's the butter clique be glad you discovered it 
Hip hop originals spook rock we runnin' this 
Playin' in the club it hits radio be bumpin' it 

Hypno 
Most of these stupid mc's could never handle the steez 
Spooks be bringin' when we singin' man why'all wing it and please 
I got the crucial chromosones to stimulate these microphones 

The hardware plus the software plus the hormones 
A prerequisite for wreckin' cliques keepin' it hectic 
Phenobarbitol could never stall this wild epileptic style 
Electric and mental spasmodic erotic 

Type of flow that could only be described as hypnotic 
Man it's a fact that I got it hemmed up and guaranteed 
Mc's approach me but they gainin' in the cranial bleed 
You need to learn to read between the lines of coke dust and weed 
You're smokin' chokin' off the speed of illusion indeed 

Spooks is on some other script 
That's why you be lovin' it 
My crew that's the butter clique be glad you discovered it 
Hip hop originals spook rock we runnin' this 
Playin' in the club it hits radio be bumpin' it 

Water water 
I speak the spookanese 
Like abomin
