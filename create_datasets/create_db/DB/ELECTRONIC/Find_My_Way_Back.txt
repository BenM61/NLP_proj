I'm gonna find my way back
Find my way back
If it takes my whole life through
I'm gonna find my way back
No matter what I must do
I'm gonna find my way back
Find my way back, find my
Way back
There's an ocean between
Us
I never meant it to be this
Way
Oh Lord if I could have
Foreseen this
I'd take us back to
Yesterday
If it takes my whole life through
I'm gonna find my way back
No matter what I must do
I'm gonna find my way back
To you
I wish I could turn back the
Time
Life was so much sweeter
Then, my friend
The only thing that keeps
Me alive
Is believing I'll be in your
Arms again, once again
If it takes my whole life through
I'm gonna find my way back
No matter what I must do
I'm gonna find my way back
To you
Even if I lose it all,
I'm gonna find my way back
No matter how far I fall,
I'm gonna find my way back
To you
Find my way back, find my
Way back,
Find my way back to you
