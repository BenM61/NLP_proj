No life we''re living when there''s no time for giving

No sign of loving in this age of push and shoving.
Another boy with a broken heart

can''t you see the pressure tearing me apart?
Oh
there''s so much for me to overcome

should I stay and fight?
Well
where else is there I can run?

How can I get out? There''s no way I can get out!
How can I get out? There''s no way I can get out!
How can I get out? There''s no way I can get out!
How can I get out? There''s no way I can get out!

No life we''re living when there''s no time for giving

No reassuring can end what I''m enduring.
I''m looking hard for the slightest sign

Hear your words echoing around my mind.
I''m starting to believe what the papers say

Yet one more blow and I''m reeling but can''t run away.

How can I get out? There''s no way I can get out!
How can I get out? There''s no way I can get out!

And if you''d open your eyes
you''d know there''s so much you could do.
Oh
if you''d open your eyes
you''d make a thousand wishes come true.
Well
this must be one of the troubles
of a-living in forgotten town.
Don''t get me wrong

hear the hollow words a-ringing now the chips are down.
