I thought that you were joking,
When you said "I want to see you,
To discuss your contribution,
To the future of our nations heart and soul",

"Six o'clock my place Whitehall",
But I arrived just after seven,
But you said "it doesn't matter,
"I under stand your situation and your image I'm flattered,
I'd just like to tell you,
That I love all of your albums,
Could you sign this for my daughter?,
She's in hospital her name is Miriam,
Now ill get down to the gist:,
Do you want a line of this?,
Are you a socialist?,

I'm doing fine,
Buzzing all the time,
Just one hit,
And I feel great,
And I support,
The welfare state,

You must be a socialist because your always of out on the piss,
In your private members bar,
Yes you are, you superstar,
Well you sing about common people,
And the misshapes and the misfits,
So can you bring them to my party,
Can you get them all to to sniff this?,

All I'm really saying is,
Come on and rock the vote for me,
All I need is come on, roll up that note for me,
The gist of all this is,
Do you want hist or do you want misses?,
Are you a socialist,
Socialist, socialist,

You can be just what you want to be,
Just as long as you don't try and compete with me,
And we've waited such a long time for a chance to help our own kind,
Please come on and tow the party line,
You owe it to yourself,
Don't think of anyone else,
We promise we won't tell,
We won't tell,
We won't, tell.
