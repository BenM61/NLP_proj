I was just coasting away 
And I wasn't even thinking of anybody no 
You took my mind sexy no doubt 
Envisioning turning you out 
And then we cought eyes ain't no stopping now 
Burn some candlelight incense 
Taste some berry wine 
Just me and you an all I want to do 
Is to get with you 
One night it could be so real 
If you just give me a chance baby 
I want to show you romance baby 
If you feel me 
Cool relax let you mind lay back 
Lace your mind like a love affair 
Cool relax let your mind lay back 
Let me know how you're feelin girl 
Now you don't know what to say 
You see that I seem 
to be staring at your body 
Oh yeah and just before 
you could speak out 
I put one finger over your mouth 
I don't mean to be jock'n 
But baby can I see you tonight 
Until the break of day 
We can't leave until you say 
It's just me and you 
All I want to do is get with you 
One night it could be so real 
If you just give me a chance baby 
I want to show you romance lady 
chorus
