I have always figured the answer was hiding
I have always pictured a perfect horizon
Now, I have somehow figured it out, simply now I'm around you
I will never picture myself getting older without you

Now I've found you, I'm allowed to paint a picture, I'm with you, surround you
Whatever it all comes down to, I don't wanna live life living without you

I don't wanna live life living without you

Now I've found you, I'm allowed to paint a picture, I'm with you, surround you
Whatever it all comes down to, I don't wanna live life living without you

I have always pictured a future so lonely
Cos' I have always lived in a world that disowned me
Now I will never picture myself being down when i'm 'round you
I just always pictured myself feeling younger around you

Now I've found you, I'm allowed to paint a picture, I'm with you, surround you
Whatever it all comes down to, I don't wanna live life living without you

I don't wanna live life living without you

Now I've found you, I'm allowed to paint a picture, I'm with you, surround you
Whatever it all comes down to, I don't wanna live life living without you

You can never know what will come your way
You can never know when it's your last day
But you will always know forever and ever
Live life living without you

Without you

Now I've found you, I'm allowed to paint a picture, I'm with you, surround you
Whatever it all comes down to, I don't wanna live life living without you
