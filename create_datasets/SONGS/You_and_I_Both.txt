Was it you who spoke the words 
That things would happen but not to me
Oh things are gonna happen naturally
Oh taking your advice
And I'm looking on the bright side 
And balancing the whole thing
Oh, but often times those words 
And it get tangled up in lines
And the bright lights turn to night
Oh, until the dawn it brings
Another day to sing about the magic that was you and me

'Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
Others only read of the love, the love that I love, yeah

See I'm all about them words
Over numbers, unencumbered numbered words
Hundreds of pages, pages, pages for words
More words then I had ever heard and I feel so alive

'Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
And if you could see me now, oh love, love
You and I, you and I
Not so little you and I anymore
And with this silence brings a moral story
More importantly evolving is the glory of a boy

'Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
And if you could see me now
Well I'm almost finally out of
I'm finally out of
Finally deedeedeedee
Well I'm almost finally, finally
Well I'm free, oh, I'm free

And it's okay if you have to go away
Oh just remember the telephones, well they work in both ways
But if I never ever hear them ring
If nothing else I'll think the bells inside
Have finally found you someone else and that's okay
'Cause I'll remember everything you sang

'Cause you and I both loved 
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of 
And if you could see me now
Well then I'm almost finally out of
I'm finally out of, finally, deedeeededede
Well I'm almost finally, finally, out of words
