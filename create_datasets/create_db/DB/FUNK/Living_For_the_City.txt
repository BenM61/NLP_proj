In the fire
It was burning
Sweetheart, I know
I should have been learning

But my pockets
Full of money, yes they were
I had someone, yes I did
To call my honey

But it's love (ooh, sweet love)
That makes a woman (ooh, that makes a woman)
Yes, it's love (ooh, sweet love)
That makes a woman (ooh, that makes a woman)

Something told me that this wouldn't last
Now my heartache is in the past
I had to swallow all of my pride
And admit to myself deep down inside

Diamonds and pearls
Don't you know that I've had enough
But I feel so much better, yes I do
Dressed in love

Yes it's love (ooh, sweet love)
That makes a woman (ooh, that makes a woman)
Yes, it's love (ooh, sweet love)
That makes a woman (ooh, that makes a woman)

What she is, yeah
What she is

Oh and it's love (ooh, sweet love)
That makes a woman yes it is (ooh, that makes a woman)
Yes, it's love (ooh, sweet love)
That makes a woman (ooh, that makes a woman)

What she is, yeah
What she is

And it's love (ooh, sweet love)
That makes a woman yeah (ooh, that makes a woman)
