Well I had a little feeling to have a big night
And I woke up feeling small and not so brave and not quite right
I had to face the where was I and who was she, what did I do
Worst of all I had to face the big light

The big light came through my window and it opened up my eyelids
And it snapped them up like roller blinds and it told me things that I did
I can't face another day and night of good ideas and complications
And I'm thankful that I didn't open another bottle of inspiration

When the hangover this morning had a personality
And I cast my shattered mind over selected memories
Didn't even touch the light switch 'cause I didn't want to see
That haggard face was staring back at me

The big light came through my window and it opened up my eyelids
And it snapped them up like roller blinds and it told me things that I did
I can't face another day and night of good ideas and complications
And I'm thankful that I didn't open another bottle of inspiration

Yes I had a little feeling to have a big time
And I woke up to alarm bells like a big church chime
I had to face the where was I and who was she, what did I do
Worst of all I had to face the big light

The big light came through my window and it opened up my eyelids
And it snapped them up like roller blinds and it told me things that I did
I can't face another day and night of good ideas and complications
And I'm thankful that I didn't open another bottle of inspiration

Oh it's nice to go out and have a big night
But sooner or later you're got to face the big light
