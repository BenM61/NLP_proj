Terror and chaos
A new world order
Reign in fear
The grip of clawed hands 

Like a plague
Sweeping across the land
The human race 
Is erased like writings
In the sand

A new leader
Will rise from
The ashes of the weak
A reign of hate
And sovereignty

Blood spill or not
Hate they breed
All human life
Will seize to be

A scream for death
A cry for pity
Deaf is the ear
Of those weak

Terror! Chaos!
Reign! Fear!

Terror and chaos
The new world order
They reign in fear
With a taste for blood

Like a plague
Sweeping across the land
The human race 
Is erased like writings
In the sand

Affiliated with the suffering
They will dominate
Affiliated with the suffering
They are here to stay
Affiliated with the suffering
Weak are they who pray
Affiliated with the suffering
There will be no second day!
