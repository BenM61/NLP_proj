And you can take this however you want
Yeah you can take this however you want
Don't be so so sure this is all it adds up to, you
You're justified
But there's no justice if it's just a lie
No, go and find yourself
You will if you look inside
And I'll never know
And you never will
Still I'll never know
And you won't find out
Until someone stands out
Then you'll get some answers
We know there's an answer
We know now that we have to find it by ourselves

And you can take this however you want
Yeah you can take this however you want
Just don't waste your breath unless you can save us
And tell me can you
Can you save us?
Can you save?
Can you save us?
This can't go on without the meaning in the rhyme
Can you save?
Can you save us?
I can't go on
Out of rhythm with our time

Our days were numbered by nights on too many rooftops
They said were wasting our lives
Oh at least we know that if we died
We lived with passion
They said we burned so bright

We run and we run
We know there's an answer
We know by going home we can find it by ourselves

When want you want is what you're getting
(they're catching onto us)
When all you can do is hide
(don't be afraid)

Oh maybe you can save us
When all we can do is hide

Oh
(we know there's an answer, we know by going home we can find it by ourselves)
