F*ck you all

My redemption is knowing
This will be over
My aggression, I fear I've lost control

Who is this man I said?
Mirror reflects a stranger
Fist shatters the despair
Awake the pain to anger

How do I close thine eyes of murder?
How do I close thine eyes of murder
Staring into me?

My obsession is dying
Sinking me deeper
My depression
This world has disavowed

Razor at wrist I seethe
The flesh is peeled apart now
Gone is my faded dream
Failure, I welcome in thou

How do I close thine eyes of murder?
How do I close thine eyes of murder
Staring into me?

Oh, this lifetime in sorrow
God, let the angels die
(Let the angels die)
This is our last goodbye
(Our last goodbye)

In love and death we cry
(Death we cry)
Our last goodbye, go

No, no, no

Spit in the face of loss
Coward, my own self-hatred
No more I bear this cross
Struggle and rise from the dead

This lifetime in sorrow
God let the angels die
(The angels die)
This is our last goodbye
(Our last goodbye)
In love and death we cry
