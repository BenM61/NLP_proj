Yonder she's walking
She comes my way
Her red dress on
Her long black hair

Walking like
Talking like
Wanting like
She comes to me

Oh, baby I love you so
I need you now
I want you back
I can't go on

Helpless baby
Evil child
I've known you well
If you want to stay, that's alright
You want me again
And then you come a-running to me
Well, baby, baby, that's alright
Oh, that's alright
Hey, that's alright

And now she's gone
She's walking away
Her red dress on
Her long black hair

Well I love her so, yeah
And now she'll come running
Anytime I say, now
Anytime I say

Oh, baby I love you so
I need you now
I want you back
I can't go on

Oh, baby I love you so
I need you now
I want you back
I can't go on

Oh, baby I love you so
I need you now
I want you back
I can't go on

I love you so, baby
I need you so
I want you back
I can't go, can't go on
