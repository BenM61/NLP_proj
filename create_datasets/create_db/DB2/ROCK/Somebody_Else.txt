I don't want somebody else
And I don't need anybody else
You're gonna see that for yourself
And you're gonna feel it in your health
'Cause I, don't want somebody else

Every time you leave me alone
Girl you know you put me out in the cold
But this time, I'm not gonna break down and cry
I'd rather die

No more pride taking us down
And no more time workin' it out
I turned all the lights off in this house
And I told all your ghosts to get out
'Cause I, don't want somebody else

Every time you leave me alone
Girl you know you put me out in the cold
But this time, I'm not gonna break down and cry
I'd rather die
