I pray you'll be our eyes, and watch us where we go.
And help us to be wise in times when we don't know
Let this be our prayer, when we lose our way
Lead us to the place, guide us with your grace
To a place where we'll be safe

La luce che tu hai
I pray we'll find your light
Nel cuore restera
And hold it in our hearts.
A ricordarci che
When stars go out each night,
Eterna stella sei

The light you have 
I pray we'll find your light 
Will be in the heart 
And hold it in our hearts. 
To remember us that 
When stars go out each night, 
You are eternal star
Nella mia preghiera
Let this be our prayer
Quanta fede see'e
When shadows fill our day

How much faith there's 
Let this be our prayer 
In my prayer 
When shadows fill our day
Lead us to a place, guide us with your grace
Give us faith so we'll be safe

Sognamo un mondo senza piu violenza
Un mondo di giustizia e di speranza
Ognuno dia la mano al suo vicino
Simbolo di pace, di fraternita

We dream a world without violence 
A world of justice and faith. 
Everyone gives the hand to his neighbours 
Symbol of peace, of fraternity
La forza che ci da
We ask that life be kind
E il desiderio che
And watch us from above
Ognuno trovi amor
We hope each soul will find
Intorno e dentro se
Another soul to love

The force his gives us 
We ask that life be kind 
Is wish that 
And watch us from above 
Everyone finds love 
We hope each soul will find 
Around and inside 
Another soul to love
Let this be our prayer
Let this be our prayer, just like every child

Need to find a place, guide us with your grace
Give us faith so we'll be safe
Need to find a place, guide us with your grace
Give us faith so we'll be safe

E la fede che
Hai acceso in noi,
Sento che ci salvera

It's the faith 
You light in us 
I feel it will save us
