I still have briars in my clothes
Did I lay you down in those?
The names on the stones were all erased
And I thought it was you that I had chased

Driveway to driveway drunk
I don't remember this too well
Glad I have the scrapes to prove
Prove it was me who fell

And the names were all we knew
And the names were all erased
From stage to stage we flew
A drink in every hand

My hand on your heart had been replaced
And I thought it was you that I had chased
Driveway to driveway drunk
I don't remember this too well

Glad I have the scrapes to prove
Prove it was me who fell
And the names were all we knew
And the names were all erased
