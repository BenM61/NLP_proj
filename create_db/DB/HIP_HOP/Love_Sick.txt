Strangely enough I've been struck
Affected by her smile
And yo, her style is worthwhile
And knowing that I'm deep like a river
I feel I should give her
Things that those others can't deliver
Contrary to what I had wished
It seems that I've been dissed
But hey, I don't want to miss this
Wonderful opportunity
My boys they try schoolin' me
But see I know what I want
Someone who'll be there for the whole nine
This honey is so fine
But now she's hung up the line
Upset because I told her I'm busy
She mad like a grizzly
And started chewin' my head off
Screamin' that I spend more time with friends
And also, she said I ruined her weekend
I said "I know the stuff we had planned
But please understand
Right now I'm loungin' with my man"
I guess I didn't realize I'd hurt her
She said I had the nerve to
Just neglect her like that
Then she started bringing up past things
And she kept asking
How come our love isn't lasting
I said, "Hey baby, please calm down
Cuz I'm still around
And it's for you that my heart pounds
Can I call you later on?
You say I treat you wrong?
But why you flippin' on me?"
She said something else and then click
Left me alone on the phone with the tone
And now I'm lovesick

Relationships can grip with the pain
Arguments in the crib, in the streets, on the train
I'm crazy fed but then still
When she ain't there I feel sad, I feel ill
Frowning cuz I'm down in the dumps
The other night I took her out
So she could shake her rump
But after we were there for a few
Some girls that I knew
Stepped up and asked me to come to
A party they were havin' at their house
I looked at my girl, and yo, she started walkin' out
I said "Hey love, just wait for a second
And won't you just check it?
It's all a part of makin' records
Those were just some friends in the business
No need to get angry
So listen up while I kick this
And what about the things we discussed
About havin' trust?
What's all this attitude stuff?
Now hon, you know that I wouldn't play you
But time after time, you let your jealousy sway you
Hey don't you turn your back like that
Come on, this is wack
You're heated up like a thermostat"
Then she stepped off in a whirlwind
And I don't know when
Or if I'm gonna see her again
I coulda sworn she was the right one to pick
But now man I'm just lovesick
