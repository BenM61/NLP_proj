Oh
Oh wo oh wo oh wo oh wo
Oh wo oh wo oh wo oh wo
Oh wo oh wo oh wo oh wo
My lady soul

Lying here beside you
Close as we can be
I know what this leads to
I know what you need, yeah

I'm ready to surrender, my love
Lay it all in your hands
Give you my forever
Everything I am

'Cause you are my, my, my, my lady soul
You warm my heart
When I grow cold
Oh you are my, my, my, my lady soul
You are my life
You make me whole
Oh wo oh wo oh wo oh wo
Oh wo oh wo oh wo oh wo
My lady soul

I feel it in your heartbeat
Hear it in your crys
This is where our hearts meet
I see it in your eyes

I've waited for this moment, my love
It's a dream come alive
Heaven must have sent me
An angel of the night

'Cause you are my, my, my, my lady soul
You warm my heart
When I grow cold
'Cause you are my, you're my, you're my, my lady soul
You're my, my lady soul, you're my lady soul
You are my life
You make me whole

I always knew we'd end up together
Right from the very start
And I believe we'll make it forever
It's written right here in my heart

Oh yeah, ay, ho
You're my, you're my, my lady soul
You warm my heart
When I grow cold
Oh you are my, my, my, my lady soul
You are my life
You make me whole
Oh wo oh wo oh wo oh wo
Oh wo oh wo oh wo oh wo
My lady soul, hoo
My, my
My, my
You're my, you're my (my, my) my lady soul
Oh wo oh wo oh wo oh wo (my, my)
Oh wo oh wo oh wo oh wo (my, my)
My, my, my, my, my, my, my
My lady soul
