Fly, let's fly away
Magic moment, magic moment
Big city life

Magic moment
Magic moment
You and I

We work every day, all no work and no play
Will make for a very lonely lifestyle
So let's get away, let's leave today
?Cause you deserve a break and a real good time

Take a carpet ride
And we?ll have the time of our lives
?Cause we have the chance
To do it right

let's take a magic moment, let's live a moment
A magical moment in the big city life
A magic moment, let's live a moment
A magical moment, just you and I, my love

there's nothing to lose, put on your shoes, girl
Baby love, it?s been such a long, long time
Don't ask me how, respond to me now
Let's try to relive our first night out

let's go to L.A. or maybe St. Tropez
Or anywhere we can get away
One moment like this is hard to resist
Sipping Dom Perignon and kissing your sweet lips

let's take a carpet ride
And we?ll have the time of our lives
?Cause we have the chance
To do it right

let's take a magic moment, let's live a moment
A magical moment in the big city life
A magic moment, let's live a moment
A magical moment, you and I

A magic moment, let's live a moment
A magical moment in the big city life
Magic moment
(Got to find away)
Magic moment, you and I
(To get away today)

Hey, hey, hey
Fly, let's fly away
Uh, uh, uh

Are you having a good time, baby?
Are you having a good time, baby?
Said it?s alright

Oh, let's take a carpet ride
And we?ll have the time of our lives
?Cause we have the chance
To do it right

let's take a magic moment, let's live a moment
A magic moment in the big city life
So put on your best dress, put on your shoes, girl
We're going out on the town and groove

A magical moment
A magical moment, big city life
Baby, take a magic carpet ride
Come on, baby, let's do our thing tonight

A magical moment
A magical moment in the big city life
Working on that 9 to 5
You need a change from your frame of mind, hey

Magic moment
Magical moment in the big city life
New York City or L.A.
St. Tropez or the Frisco Bay

let's live a moment
A magical moment in the big city life
One moment like this is hard to resist
Sipping Dom Perignon and kissing your sweet lips

Magic moment, baby, oh, yeah
Magic moment in the big city life
We work out today, no work and no play
So don't you think it?s time to get away

Magic moment, oh, yeah
Magic moment, in the big city life
You and I

Magic moment, magic moment
Big city life, magic moment
