Baby was dancin'
With Charly standing in line in the wing
And yesterday's rain turns to snow
Shake your head now honey child
Shake your head now honey child
Jump back while I clean them up
Shake your head now honey child

Spotlights are blinding
Like stars shooting down on the man
Who fell to earth
Spiraling up to the sky
Shake your head now honey child
Shake your head now honey child
Jump back while I clean them up
Shake your head now honey child

Shake that head, shake that head
Shake my head, shake my head
Swing up the line, swing up the line
Swing up that line, swing up that line
Funk it up, funk it up
Funk it up, funk it up
Swing up the back, light up the front

Shake your head now honey child
Shake your head now honey child
Jump back while I clean them up
Shake your head now honey child
