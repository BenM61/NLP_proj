Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh

People get ready, there's a train a-comin'
You don't need no baggage, you just get on board
All you need is faith to hear the diesels hummin'
Don't need no ticket, you just thank the Lord

Mm hm

So people get ready for the train to Jordan
Picking up passengers (oh) from coast to coast
Faith is the key, open the doors and board them
There's room for all among the loved the most

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner
Who would hurt all mankind (oh) just to save his own (leave me now)
Have pity on those whose chances grow thinner
But there's no hiding place from this kingdom's throne

So people get ready, there's a train a-comin'
You don't need no baggage, you just get on board
All you need is faith to hear the diesels hummin'
You don't need no ticket, you just thank the Lord
Oh oh
