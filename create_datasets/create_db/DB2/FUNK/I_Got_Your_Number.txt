I got your number
I know you're gonna be there when I call
I got your number, baby
I'd say you ain't got no choice at all

No, no, no, no...

I took your head from lonely,
Chased your pain away
I gave you more than loving
In my special way

I said
I shocked you out of boredom,
Made you a faithful wife
Gave you an education
On the facts of life

In you there's come a change
I'll be damned, I got you trained

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

I got your number
I know you're gonna be there when I call
I got your number, sugar
I'd say you ain't got no choice at all

No, no, no, no, no...

Why listen to your girlfriends
When they can plainly see
That the boy that they call lover
Ain't half the man as me
I don't have to do nothing
Long as you're satisfied
Cause if you need more loving, baby
There's plenty more inside
Just tell them "I'm glad that he's my man"
Something they'll never understand

No, no, no...

I got your number
To know you're gonna be there when I call
I got your number, sugar
I'd say you ain't got no choice at all

No, no, no, no, no, no...

My hat goes off to you
For lovin' me the way you do
Even though I know, I know...

I got your number
I know you're gonna be there when I call
I got your number, baby
Said you ain't got no choice at all

No, no, no, no...

I got your number
I know you gonna be there when I call
I got your number...
