Sounds 
Embracing the silence 
Vanishing through the air 
The melody of flight 
Into the stars at night 
It's the song for the soul 
If heaven closes 

Shadows 
From the other side 
Reflecting a glimpse of light 
The mystery of life 
Echoes through the night 
It's the song for the soul 
If heaven closes
