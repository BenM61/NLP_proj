I'm flowing with the waters
I'm spinning into orbit
So won't you come on home
And make it alright

I'm drifting in the same old boat
With a different crew
So won't you come on home
And make it alright
Won't you echo back
And make it fine

Maybe you'll go out of your mind
You can lose it all if you wanna
Maybe you'll go out of mine
It's been so long

You can keep your own dear life
You can lose it all if you wanna
But I can't keep you out of mine, oh no

We were dancing to a beat of our own
Flying with our speakers blown
Oh won't you come on back
And make it alright

And if I take a turn for the worst
And I call you on the phone
Will you echo home when I call
Won't you echo back and make it alright
Won't you echo home and make me fine

Maybe you went out of your mind
You can lose it all if you wanna
Maybe you went out of mine
It's been so long

You can live your own dear life
You can lose it all if you wanna
But I can't let you out of mine, oh no

And it's a long long long long drop
From the rocks to the pearls, we got so lost
We got so lost, we got so lost
For so long

And it's a long long long long drop
From the rocks to the pearls, we got so lost
We got so lost, we got so lost
For so long, for so long, so long
For so long, oh

Maybe you went out of your mind
You can lose it all if you wanna
Maybe you went out of mine
It's been so long

You can live your own dear life
And you can lose it all if you wanna
But I can't let you out of mine, oh no

I'm flowing with the waters
I'm spinning into orbit
So won't you come on home
And make it alright
So won't you come on home
And make it fine
