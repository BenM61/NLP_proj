Tzena, Tzena, Tzena, Tzena
Can't you hear the music playing
In the city square
Tzena, Tzena, Tzena, Tzena
Come where all our friends will find us
With the dancers there

Tzena, Tzena join the celebration
There'll be people there from every nation
Dawn will find us laughing in the sunlight
Dancing in the city square

Tzena, Tzena, come and dance the Hora
One, two, three, four
All the boys will envy me for
Tzena, Tzena, when the band is playing
My heart's saying
Tzena, Tzena, Tzena

Tzena, Tzena, Tzena, Tzena
Can't you hear the music playing
In the city square
Tzena, Tzena, Tzena, Tzena
Come where all our friends will find us
With the dancers there

Tzena, Tzena, Tzena, Tzena
Can't you hear the music playing
In the city square
Tzena, Tzena, Tzena, Tzena
Come where all our friends will find us
With the dancers there

Tzena, Tzena 
Can't you hear the music playing
In the city square
Tzena, Tzena
Come where all our friends will find us
With the dancers there

Can't you hear the music playing
In the city square
Tzena, Tzena, Tzena, Tzena
Come where all our friends will find us
