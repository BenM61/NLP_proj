Awaken, breathe
Hear the calling in the wind
The voice, it's saying
A journey must begin

We'll fly like a bird
In a scattered cloudy sky
Leave aside the city worries
It's just a minute away

In my heart I'll paint
And I swear it's where I'll be Oh!

I shall be there (be there Yeah!)
Will you be there
I shall be there (be there Yeah!)
Will you be there too ?

Come and look in silence br Believe in what you see
(In a place like this)
The starry skies can move the mountains
The sun will warn the sea

In my heart I'll paint
And I swear it's where I'll be Oh!

I shall be there (be there Yeah!)
Will you be there
I shall be there (be there Yeah!)
Will you be there too ?

I shall be there (be there Yeah!)
Will you be there
I shall be there (be there Yeah!)
Will you be there too ?
