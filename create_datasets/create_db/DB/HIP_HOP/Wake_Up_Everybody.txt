Making love till you scream, I wanna wake everybody
While we're making children, I wanna wake everybody
And I mean every, every, every

Take your time, we got all night
Trust in me I'm gonna get it right
Whatever's on, take it off
I wanna get inside with you baby and get lost

And the more I lay with you
I'm not concerned about what neighbors gon' do
And I don't care if they leave this room
'Cause we'll be

Making love till you scream, I wanna wake everybody
While we're making children, girl I wanna wake everybody
And I mean every, every, every

The way we touch, the way we kiss
Oh girl I love it when it feels like this
Just forget about what you had to do
'Cause the night is all about me and you

And the more I lay with you
I'm not concerned about what neighbors gon' do
And I don't care if they leave this room
'Cause we'll be

Making love till you scream, Oh yes we will, I wanna wake everybody
While we're making children, children, I wanna wake everybody
Girl I mean every, every, every

So open the window baby
I don't care if the world hears us baby
'Cause as long as you're here lyin next to me
Girl, we can roll on the floor, open the doors
Don't need no privacy

We'll be making love till you scream, I wanna wake everybody
While we're making children, I wanna wake everybody
Making love till you scream, I wanna wake everybody
While we're making children, I wanna wake everybody
Making love till you scream, I wanna wake everybody
While we're making children, I wanna wake everybody
