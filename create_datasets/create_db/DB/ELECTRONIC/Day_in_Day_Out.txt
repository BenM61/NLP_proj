[Featuring GangStarr] 
[Chorus] 
the life you is walking through 
such a bitch 
day in to day out the same old thing kid 
[Verse 1   Spek] 
bring me to the end and I'll be me 
open up your eyes wide so you can see 
it's thick to be me 
how I kick my rhymes down pat 
within the circle how we do 
when we kick that fact 
but where's the meaning? 
I take it one night by one night 
but where's the meaning? 
I take it one day by every day 
I pick a rhyme I chose and put it number one inside my placement 
so look to find the signs inside my basement 
no tears 
sell us full of samples with ample time to loop 
it's just the beats from the dead from my head with my troop 
and it be cool if all the time was like studio time 
but days are long enough for Spek with the rest of my time 
I think I'm manic depressive and not aggressive enough 
you can try to be hard but damn you still won't be rough 
life is whack for the ?? life is phat if you flow 
life is waitin' for a deal when you like got no dough 
[Chorus] 
[Verse 2 - Spek, Lu] 
in the middle of my nights I check my late night flicks 
I'm up at night trying to write and late night I get my kicks 
that is I'm out to get my main feature 
the low budget picture in my room and in between I write scriptures 
picture this the day's just a claender's notch 
and every kid becomes the one who want to ride it on the crotches 
and when I'm finished when my flick is almost done 
when my rhyme is half done 
when I check a late re-run 
I lose to the groove soul sounds soothe me well 
sometimes my mind wonders sometimes heaven could be hell 
I pass the fools who has never known my name 
when I think about the deal sometimes I need someone to blame 
I add members to the show who knows a fan 
for the ones that want to capture the essence of level 
to the hip-hop their directions they groke 
who's representing us? the critics holy smoke 
[Chorus] 
[Verse 3 - Lu] 
place text in images replacing old versions 
documents displayed as homemade 
glue without a clue you your loophole is deckin' in the halls to ring 
bells 
in fear of losing clientels 
my work place is infinite 
but can't plan it like my screens appearance is translusive 
but with a hard ??? I display I cruhser critics 
as easy as... 
skip this step if you want to 
control key available to only keyboards you can't afford 
Q he's the shift he's the roller 
can't understand your education is basic (science) 
so many words and everything is being said 
yet people get pissed 
when people want to your way but not their way so which way's the right 
way 
I'm going hungry in the belly of the beast 
that uncleans the serpent 
I walk like the lion I'm a leash 
[Chorus]
