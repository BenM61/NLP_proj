What you mean I'm mean?
I'm mean, truth be told
Only be in truthful, you fool with fools
You're failure full of lies that lie
I realize
It's exactly what you are
You're the brightest of the stars
Out shining more than far
Don't let no man ever put you down
Take a thinking need to say that again
Don't let no man ever put you down
Gonna lay you much you win
Some days it might be cold
Some days it might be harder
