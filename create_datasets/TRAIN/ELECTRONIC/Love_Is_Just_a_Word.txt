I look into the night
Stars are shining so bright
And I feel what it means to be lonely again.
I'm touchin' your face
You just want my embrace
And I feel what it means to be lonely again without you -
Again - what is love?
Love is just a word in my life
It's neither livin' nor dyin'.
I believe in all I can see
Love is the word I'm denyin' -
What is love?
You - a face in the crowd
You - the hope and the doubt
And I fear that I'm losing myself now again.
You - have broken my dreams
You - don't know what it means
To be lost in a world of confusion again without you -
Again - what is love?
Love is just a word in my life
It's neither livin' nor dyin'. . . .
Love is just a word in my life
It's neither livin' nor dyin'. . . .
Love is just a word in my life
It's neither livin' nor dyin'. . . .
