A wild ride, over stony ground
Such a lust for life, the circus comes to town
We are the hungry ones, on a lightning raid
Just like a river runs, like a fire needs flame, oh
I burn for you

I gotta feel it in my blood, whoa oh
I need your touch, don't need your love, whoa oh
(And I want, and I need)
(And I lust, animal)
(And I want, and I need)
(And I lust, animal)

Cry wolf, given mouth-to-mouth
Like a movin' heartbeat in the witching hour
I'm runnin' with the wind, a shadow in the dust
And like the drivin' rain, yeah, like the restless rust
I never sleep

I gotta feel it in my blood, whoa oh
I need your touch, don't need your love, whoa oh
(And I want, and I need)
(And I lust, animal)
(And I want, and I need)
(And I lust, animal) huh, ah

Cry wolf, baby, cry tough
Gonna hunt you like an, an, an, an, an animal
Gonna take your love and run

I gotta feel it in my blood, whoa oh
I need your touch, don't need your love, whoa oh
(And I want, and I need)
(And I lust, animal)
(And I want, and I need)
(And I lust, animal)

(And I want, and I need)
(And I lust, animal)
(And I want, and I need) tame me, tie me
(And I lust, animal) make me your animal
(And I want, and I need) show me, stroke me
(And I lust, animal) let me be your animal

(Animal) and I want
(And I need, animal) ooh, ooh, ooh, animal (animal)
