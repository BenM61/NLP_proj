It was a bad idea
But I had to follow through,
She had no idea what I wanted to do
It was a bad idea
But I had to hit it anyway

Candy caught my eye when she walked by lookin' like a freak
I leaned over kissed her on the cheek.
I was being careful not to move too fast,
But she smiled when I gave her a backstage pass.
A real star fucker, she put me to the test,
Then I noticed Doug Ray tattooed on her breast.
I thought I was blessed to meet this treat
Candy had a place right down the street.
It didn't take long to achieve my goal
And I lost control of mind, body, and soul.

It was a bad idea

Let me tell you how I got my pumas stolen.
It was a summer day and the sky was golden.
I was having a slice down on University
And in comes a cutie, about 5 foot 3
Caught her checkin' me out so I flashed a smile.
Introduced myself 'cause that's my style.
She said, "Yeah I know you, I love your CD.
I know all your rhymes, you're my favorite MC."
Quick to the point no time at all
Snuck on in to her residence hall.
In ten minutes flat we were both butt naked.
She was screaming and yelling yo I just couldn't take it.
Her roomate got pissed while we fucked in her bed,
Bitch stole my pumas while I was getting head.

I can't believe I'm never gonna see you again,
You were more than a lover, you were also a friend.
The things I learned, in just one night,
When I say goodbye, it'll be alright, alright, alright!
Now people let me tell you 'bout this girl Suzanne,
Met her at the bar and I was like god damn!
She didn't have a man, no drink in her hand,
Bought her a shot and took her back to the van.
She was tall, slim, and tan. A White Owl fan,
Asked if I would take part in some perverted plan?
She dropped her skirt, she had another head.
I lost my pride in that groupie's bed
