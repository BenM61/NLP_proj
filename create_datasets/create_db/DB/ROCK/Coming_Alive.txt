There was a time I was afraid
Of getting close to you.
Your potency was quite threatening
Fiber pure, touching scars
Feels good to finally hold you.

It was my mistake
For not trusting you
It was my mistake
Well this is now

I'm no longer afraid
I'm coming alive
And no one can take it away
I'm coming alive

Unbelievable force
When your close to my lips
When feeling the intensity you give me
I adore you
And always will
Psychoactive and delicate

It was my mistake
Well this is now

I'm no longer afraid
I'm coming alive
And no one can take it away
I'm coming alive

You saved me from these nightmares
You took control of me
You saved me from this heartache
And never judged me.

And now I'm coming alive
I'm coming alive
Alive!
