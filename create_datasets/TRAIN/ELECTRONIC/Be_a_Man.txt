The world is quiet, 
Like there's no one around, 
But I feel you beside me. 

I know the secrets, 
You keep locked away inside, 
Don't understand, why you are fighting. 

I know, she must be special, 
This new girl by your side, 
I seek for answers, when I look into your eyes, 


And he turns, so I can't, but I will be strong.
For once in your life, be a man, 
Just tell me the words, 'cause I know 
That you can, 
Don't leave me with scars, 
That no one can heal. 
For once in your life, be a man. 

You made me love you, 
Love you right from the start. 
You're controlling my heart, babe. 

Don't pack your bags yet. 
Give me time to say goodbye. 
(Say goodbye) 
Just don't leave me wounded. 

No, I just hope you will regret the things you do 
Come back to me, 
'Cause our love is the real thing. 


I knew that I, 

I fought to keep our love strong. 
If you leave me now, 
You come running back for more, babe. 
And I hope for, and I wish for, 

And I pray, that the words from your mouth can, 
Eventually make you a man. 
For once in your life, 
Be a man. 

When everything stops.
For a minute in your life, 
I'll hope that, 
For once in your life, be a man 

Be a man. 
Just tell me the words, 'cause I know that you can, 
Don't leave me with scars, 
That no one can heal. 

For once in your life, be a man. 
Be a man. 
Tell me the words. 
Once in your life. 

Be a man. 
Tell me the words.
