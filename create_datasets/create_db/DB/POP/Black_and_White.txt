All my love
In black and white
On this color photograph
Sad sad eyes
Know too much
You will always start to cry

Why should I wait for tomorrow?
Why should I wait for tomorrow?

When you left
I closed the door
Closed my eyes
Sat on the floor
Heart beat fast
Mind got slow
This great love is
All I know

Why should I wait for tomorrow?
Why should I wait for tomorrow?

All my love
In black and white
On this faded photograph
Sad sad eyes
Know too much
You will always start to cry
You will always start to cry
Oh, you will always start to cry
Oh, you will always start to cry
You will always start to cry
Oh, you will always start to cry
