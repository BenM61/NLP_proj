Hold Up

And she love it
And She love it

I make her get down on a dime, Open up the store
Slide down slow she getting down on the floor (And She love It)
Slide down slow she getting down on the floor (And She love It)
Slide down slow she getting down on the floor

I can feel you putting my dick inside your mouth
Trying to fit my whole dick and nuts inside your mouth
I'm jumping in and out your pussy trying to stretch it out
When I hit you from the back you say don't pull it out (Out, out)
And that nigga that you live with ain't like me
Ain't from Atlanta but I know these hoes like me
They pulling on my zipper wanna bite me
I got a bitch from Oakland like to get hype
In the bed with her head in a jib
Eating on my dick like its some corn or a barbecue rib
Drop it to the floor, let me f*ck with you
Get the camera out, bitch I'm gonna take some pictures

I make her get down on a dime, Open up the store
Slide down slow she getting down on the floor (And She love It)
Slide down slow she getting down on the floor (And She love It)
Slide down slow she getting down on the floor

Slide down slow she getting down on the floor (And She love It)

She's a big fine something ain't she, with that big ass
Bet you she can grind something can't she, she shake it fast
Shake it slow, to and fro, back and forth, up and down
That apple bottom clowning it ain't fucking around
She got a something on, been kinda tight
Real stuck on that backside, It's looking kind of right
With the juicy tank top and a loop of ten heels
All bullshit aside, she looking ready to kill
But when I say kill, I mean murder the cock
I'm talking beating the pussy up while the headboards knock
She ain't watching the clock, ain't gonna answer the phone
Cause Bun Beata got that dick that put your cheek in a zone

I make her get down on a dime, open up the store
Slide down slow she getting down on the floor (And She love It)
Slide down slow she getting down on the floor (And She love It)
Slide down slow she getting down on the floor

These hoes loving the living, I'm giving all they can take
These hoes living for loving, I'm shoving dick til' they break
Put your feet in the sky, bring your knees to your chest
Grab a hold to the sheets bitch, and I'ma do the rest
Get to pressing on your pink, gripping on your soft
To the side, take a ride, From the back I break you off

I want some pussy and some navel and some ass and some mouth
I ain't fucking for me bitch, I'm fucking for the whole south
Show me what you working with, bitch what you got
I really wanted to f*ck but hoe you went and shaved your cock
A bald head pussy ain't shit, got them razor bumps bitch
Grow some hair and get legit
