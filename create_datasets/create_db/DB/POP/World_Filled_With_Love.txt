Saw some pictures in the paper
Of a girl I'd met the day before
I couldn't believe that hours later
I had reporters knocking at my door
But I used to dream about the
Life I'm living now and
I didn't think I'd miss those things from the past
And I'm not afraid of leaving or letting go of what I had 'cause
I realize that now there's no turning back

'cause I'm a young heart living in a world filled with love
So when teardrops fall from me like rain from above 
I can brush my troubles away 
know that deep down inside
I've got sunshine in my life

I used to think i could do better
My girlfriends always used to get me wrong
Sent distant messages, love letters
But those kind of feelings never lasted long
'cause now the only love I find's whithin a castle made of sand
And when the tide goes out it's swept away
Though I've got my peace of mind & time is firmly on my side
So through the bad times I can safely say...


Ah... now that love's here to stay
I've found a better day to brush my troubles away
