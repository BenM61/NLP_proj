We dreamed our little dreams
And now we're waking
To love a little more
The joys we miss
We'll smile although are
hearts are breaking
Just whispering this

Must we say farewell to dreams
To our hopes and our golden schemes?
To the lake we roamed
Hand in hand
To the castle's high
You and I have planned.
Day will end, the night will fall
In my dreams I will hear you call
Tell me, heart of mine, Oh tell me,
What am I to do?
Must I say farewell to dreams
and you!

Day will end, the night will fall
In my dreams I will hear you call
Tell me, heart of mine, Oh tell me
What am I to do?
Must I say farewell to dreams
and you!
