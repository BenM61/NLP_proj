Candyman messiah
Candyman messiah

Standing at the end of the rainbow
Expected a pot of gold
What's the use in money that's borrowed
Facing a blues i was never told
Cashing out i'll hit rock bottom
I've stretched the rubber beyond control

A lullaby on clouds of cotton
Like an aircraft a power station
I've got a payback on my investment
Gonna rule the united nations
Cashing out on the last component
Got my string in good vibration
