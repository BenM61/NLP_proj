Baby I don't wanna break your legs 
But I do what I gotta just to make you stay 
And I id hunt ya down you ever run'd away from me 

I got a pocket full of medicines 
And a a closet big enough to hide you in 
So come on baby wont you come 
I'm gonna count to three 

'Cause

You say it was your sister but your full of shit 
And I I won't hear another word of it this time 
Not this time 
So let me tell you what we gonna do 
Be true to me baby ill be true to you 
Think fast player cause your life is on the line 
And I don't wanna let you go

Is there a problem, did I hear you right 
You say your handcuffs are a little tight 
What's wrong now, man you used to love this game 

You should have listened when I told you to treat me right 
Now you'd be lucky if you make it through the night 
All this work for nothing baby can't you see 

Wrap your heart up in my fragile state of mind 
Didn't have to end this way but you told a lie 
And I don't wanna let you 
Go
