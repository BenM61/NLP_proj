We skipped the light fandango
Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor
I was feeling kind of sea-sick
And the crowd called out for more
And the room was humming harder
As the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
But the waiter brought a tray
And so it was later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

You said there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
And would not let her be
And one of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might just as well be closed
And so it was later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

And so it was later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale
A whiter shade of pale
Turned a whiter shade of pale
A whiter shade of pale
