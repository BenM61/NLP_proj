Been in this grass here for the last ten hours
My clothes are dirty but my mouth isn't dry
How does it happen, does it fly through the air
Oh, I gave up asking days away
I gave up asking
Days away

And now I'm lying here waiting for the sound of thunder
Waiting for the sound of thunder
Here I am, I'm the dotted line
Cut the corners stick me to your door
I'm the man who stepped off the path
And I just lie here
It's what I was made for

And now my eyes are closing but I still feel the land
Leaning out for the touch of my hand

The world spins so fast
That I might fly off
The world spins so fast 
That I might fly off
The world spins so fast
That I might fly off

I'm waiting for the sound of thunder
I'm waiting for the sound of thunder
I'm waiting for the sound of thunder
I'm waiting for the sound of thunder
I'm waiting for the sound of thunder
I'm waiting for the sound of thunder
I'm waiting for the sound of thunder
I'm waiting for the sound of thunder
