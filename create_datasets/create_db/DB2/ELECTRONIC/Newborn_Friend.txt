I wash my faith in dirty water,
'Cause it gives my mind a little order.
And I play that game, just like I should do.
But my whole world, slips away.

I live my life, I live it slowly.
And I take my time, I'm in no hurry, yeah, I'm livin'
And when I go then I would surely.

I would dance with a total stranger,
And hold them in my arms. 
Hell, there could be no danger if I open up up, 
'Cause when the cryin' starts so,

If I chant for happiness, 
Maybe that will make me feel better? 
I can't change my ideals, I can't lose my desire 
Oh, if I chant for happiness maybe that will make me feel better? 
I'd be your newborn friend for the world.

Well I wash my face in dirty water.
For life I have no order.
'Cause I,
Know that feeling when you've tried to make your way out,
Nothing mends.
So you search for the breed of the problems there lying,
Deep down in the soul.
And if, they never end,
There's a whole bunch of reasons, tryin' to get out
But they can't make it out of the door.
Oh, I know the reason,
I'm not enough.
There's nothing more
But

If I chant for happiness, maybe that will make me feel better. 
I can't changes my ideals, I can't put out the fire. 
Oh, if I chant for happiness, maybe that will bring us together,
For the better
I can't changes my ideals, I can't lose my desire. 
I'm just a newborn friend for the world
Just a newborn friend for the world
I'll be your newborn friend and I'll
