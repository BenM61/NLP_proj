Seems like you were lit inside
I feel like fog beside the shine
Figure fades away
Someone takes my place
Meshing with the pictures on the pages

There's no-one driving
There's no-one driving
There's no-one driving
There's no-one

The family's back from long ago
The voices burnt, the voices gold
Vapour trails go by
Voices on the lines
Nothing to come back to can't we fade?

There's no-one driving
There's no-one driving
There's no-one driving
There's no-one

Someone's gone liquid in the sheets
A sudden smell of burning leaves
The old streets overgrown
Somewhere else to go
It's just another switchback can't we fade?

There's no-one driving
There's no-one driving
There's no-one driving
There's no-one
