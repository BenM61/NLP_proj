Brother Man nowadays living in the ghetto 
Where the danger's sure enough real 
Well when he's out late at night 
And if he's got his head on right 
Well, I lay you 9 to 5 he's walking with steal. 

Brother Man says he's 'fraid of gangsters 
Messing with people just for fun 
He don't want to be next 
He got a family to protect 
So just last week he bought himself a gun. 

Everybody got a pistol, everybody got a 45 
And the philosophy seem to be 
At least as near as I can see 
When other folks give up theirs, I'll give up mine. 

This is a violent civilization 
If civilization's where I am 
Every channel that I stop on 
Got a different kind of cop on 
Killing them by the million for Uncle Sam 

Saturday night just ain't that special 
Yeah, I got the constitution on the run 
'Cause even though we've got the right 
To defend our home, to defend our life 
Got to understand to get it in hand about the guns 

Everybody got a pistol, everybody got a 45 
And the philosophy seem to be 
At least as near as I can see 
When other folks give up theirs, I'll give up mine. 

Saturday night just ain't that special 
Freedom to be afraid is all you want 
Yes if you don't want to be next 
You've got a family to protect 
9 out of 10, you've got a friend, you've got a gun. 

Everybody got a pistol, everybody got a 45 
And the philosophy seem to be 
At least as near as I can see 
When other folks give up theirs, I'll give up mine. 

Everybody got a pistol, this mosty be the N-R-A 
Yeah 'cause when it's time to shine up 
You know damn well they're gonna line up 
Everybody

And the philosophy seem to be 
At least as near as I can see 
When other folks give up theirs, I'll give up mine
