"Looks like I've lost my will to carry on, my friend" she said
And you can hear it in my whispered cries for love
I need your blissful touch to carry me away again
So can we roll tonight, roll through your desert, can we start over and just

Run away, run away tonight
It ain't no victory, but I don't care, I don't care if its wrong or right
We can just run away, run away tonight
It ain't no victory but I don't care, I don't care if its wrong or right

"Looks like I've lost my will to carry on, my friend" she said
I'm like a posse that's been ridin' for days
I've got the scars to prove that love has had its day and it's way with me
So can we roll tonight, roll through your desert, can we start over and just

Run away, run away tonight
It ain't no victory but I don't care, I don't care if its wrong or right
We can just run away, run away tonight
It ain't no victory but I don't care, I don't care if its wrong or right

This ain't no night to be on your own
You've got to know where you're coming from
To know just where you're goin', lord
You've got to know where you're coming from
This ain't no night to be on your own

Run away, run away tonight
It ain't no victory but I don't care, I don't care if its wrong or right
We can just run away, run away tonight
It ain't no victory but I don't care
I don't care I don't care I don't care I don't care
Run away
Run away
Run away
