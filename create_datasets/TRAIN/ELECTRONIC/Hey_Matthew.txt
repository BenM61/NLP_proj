I was sitting with Matthew, 
we were watching TV I said;
Hey Matthew, what do you see? 
Do you see the guns? Do you see the bombs? 
See those people throwing all of those stones? 
Do you see the cars going up in flames? 
See their faces, do you know their names? 
Hey Matthew, when you're watching TV;
Hey, Hey Matthew, what do you see? 

Do you see the tension in a rich man's house? 
Do you see the cat? Do you see the mouse? 
Do you see the beauty or the big bad beast? 
Do you see the famine? Do you see the feast? 
In this world of villains do you see the crime? 
Is a superhero waiting at the edge of time? 
Hey Matthew, when you're watching TV; 
I said Hey, Hey Matthew, what do you see? 

I see Dallas, Dynasty, Terrahawks, 
He-Man, Tom and Jerry, Dukes of Hazzard, 
Airwolf, Blue Thunder, Rambo, Road Runner, 
Daffy Duck, The A-Team, The A-Team, I see the A-Team.

I was sitting with Matthew, 
we were watching TV;
I said Hey Matthew, 
what'll you be? 
Will you walk like a lion in the danger zone? 
Will you pass unnoticed in the great unknown? 
When you see the press out on a witch hunt.
When you see a political publicity stunt.
Will you fight for the right? Will you be a man? 
Will you step aside? Will you give a damn? 

Will you ride that tide with the starry eyed? 
Will you give and take? 
Will you laugh 'til you ache? 
Will you learn to live? 
Will you take? Will you give? 
As the bridges burn, will you live and learn? Will you be numbered with the brave and true? Well, good luck kid, here's lookin' at you. 

In the future, Matthew, so bright and free, 
Hey Matthew, what'll you be? 
Hey Hey Matthew, what'll you be? 

I want to be a soldier, street fighter, be a policeman, A captain of a boat - big boat. 
I want to be a medic man, a cowboy, 
a train driver, high jump champion, 
a fireman, a pilot, I want to be your friend. 

It's all a game - I hope. 

Hey Matthew, 
Hey Hey Matthew. 

I hope. 
I hope. 
I hope. 
I hope.
