There's a child who dies by hunger
There's a child who dies in war
And the need of help gets stronger
There's so much we can't ignore

There's a child who lives in danger
There's a the child who lives in pain
There's a the child who's a stranger
They need love, a helping hand

Oh, some day we will live together
In a world of harmony
'Cause we never give it up and we never gonna lose
Come on children, sing with me 

For the children of love
We want peace in this world
For the children of love
For every boy and every girl

For the children of love
We want joy and we want fun
For the children of love
Freedom just for everyone 

There's a child who lost it's parents
There's a child who lost it's friends
If there's nobody who helps them

Oh, this story never ends
Oh, today we stay together
And we know our destiny
And we never give it up and we never gonna lose

Come on children, sing with me 
Believe in love - freedom for all
For the children of the world
We want it all
