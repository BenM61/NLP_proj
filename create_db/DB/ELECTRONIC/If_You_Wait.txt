To treasure gold is fun
Brother, drop your bag at once
From the air to the people
A mass to take you on
From a clock to the past
A future that I own
And to find just one other
Seems to be the goal of everyone
From the search to the hurt
I believed I could take you on
We would drink, we would dance
And you would watch me whenever you want

And can you give me, everything
Everything, everything
'Cause I can't give you anything
And if you wait, if you wait
I will trust in time that we will meet again
If you wait

If letters spell out words, son
You chose to put them in order, didn't you
From the meaning, the moment you tried to take me on
From the air to the room a bed that I own

And can you give me everything,
Everything, everything
'Cause I can't give you anything
And if you wait, if you wait
I will trust in time that we will meet again
If you wait
I will trust in time that we will meet again
