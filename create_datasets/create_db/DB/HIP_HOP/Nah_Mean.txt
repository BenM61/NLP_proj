Ya' nah mean, mi dip out a whole fourteen, nah mean,
And reload man extra magazine, nah mean,

And jump pon mi big trampoline, nah mean,
And boost up her self-esteem, nah mean,
'Nough a wonder how man kitchen so clean, nah mean,
And which recipe dat a steam, nah mean,

Make you feel like you living in a dream, nah mean,

It come to discipline man a dean, nah mean,
Mi tougher than a hummer limousine, nah mean,
We stepping we fresh and we clean, nah mean,

We celebrate like I finished probation, boy boy
Noty head with no chaser, boy boy
From the mouth I can spit out a razor, boy boy
Open up your facial like your boy Roy
In his prime, eat food, dinnertime
Jr. gong pass the Guinness, handle business, black velvet sippers
Females never bid us farewell, they with us
Cause we arrive on the scene
Just like a high beam, nah mean
Don't let us have to make the 9 scream, nah mean
At your racial policing regime, nah mean
Spiritual like a Elohim, nah mean
In a casino or a yacht wherever I'm seen
My brothers and sisters are never forgot, nah mean
Don't wanna hear another soldier drop, nah mean
Another dope addict get shot with the morphine
And feds are indicting my block, nah mean
They're wearing red from they shoes to they top, nah mean
I'm wishing that all the violence would stop, nah mean

We nuh like the sound of siren, nah mean
And some bwoy soft like ice cream, nah mean
From a bwoy mek the feds intervene, nah mean
We send a bwoy go tek intravene, nah mean
Parabellum dem a itch up inna spleen, nah mean
Inna queens gunman reign supreme, nah mean
Kingstonians are real blood fiends, nah mean
The world is a big crime scene, nah mean

Yo yo mr. president
What you doing for my residence?
Yo mr. minister
Why you being sinister?
Yo yo mr. president
What you doing for my residence?
Yo mr. minister
Why you being sinister?

You think a lie we badder than Al Pacine, nah mean

Its genocide its a genocide

Fifth floor cooking raw had my own supply
Cause of capitalist ways
That was back in the days
So now I do rap and it pays
