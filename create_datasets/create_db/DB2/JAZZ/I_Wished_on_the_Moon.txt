I wished on the moon
For something I never knew
Wished on the moon
For more than I ever knew

A sweeter rose, a softer sky
An April days that would not dance away

I begged on the stars
To throw me a beam or two
Wished on a stars
And asked for a dream or two

I looked for every loveliness it all came true
I wished on the moon for you

I begged a star to throw me a beam or two or three
I asked the star to send down a dream just meant for me
I looked for every loveliness, it all came true
I wished on the moon for you
