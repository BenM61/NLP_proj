Write on
Even though there's no one listening to your songs, write on
Shine on, get it together, let your light break through
Shine on, baby, shine on

Write on, sitting on your own waiting for the phone
Come on, come on, come on
Write on, for your fame and fortune will follow you
Coming on strong, coming on strong

Don't feel bad 'cause the radio ain't playing 'em
It won't be long till you're going out and slayin' 'em
Shine on
You're not the first, you won't be the last
To feel the frustration of a musical fast
Write on, baby, write on

Sing your rock and roll with a touch of soul
Ballads with feeling, send your audience reeling
Rock on, rock on
Find a man with a van, and a back up band
Who'll give you a hand on your one night stand
Rock on, baby, rock on
Give 'em your licks, getting off on their kicks
Swayin' in motion to a rhythmic potion
Rock on, baby, rock on

Give it to me

Music freaks and all those hustlers
Hangers on, trying to make a con, rock on
Don't sign on the line till you know it's all fine
It's your life baby, you got to give it time
Rock on, baby, rock on

Write on
Even though there's no one listening to your songs, write on
Baby, shine on, get it together, let your light break through
Shine on, shine on

Don't feel bad 'cause the radio ain't playing 'em
It won't be long till you're going out and slayin' 'em
Shine on
You're not the first, you won't be the last
To feel the frustration of a musical fast
Write on, baby, write on

Sing your rock and roll with a touch of soul
Ballads with feeling, send your audience reeling
Rock on, baby, rock on
Find a man with a van, and a back up band
Who'll give you a hand on your one night stand
Rock on, rock on
Give 'em your licks, getting off on their kicks
Swayin' in motion to a rhythmic potion
Rock on, baby, rock on

Rock and roll with a touch of soul
Ballads, baby, ballads with a feeling, rock on
