Up in this bitch and we all faded
F*ck 'bout a bitch, no we don't save her
Nothin' to a boss, do my own thing
It's money over ho's, no I'm no stranger
One more bounce, we got more ounces
One more bounce, we got more ounces
One more bounce, we got more ounces
One more bounce, we got more ounces

About three of them, dawg I'm not kiddin'
When I tell you if you came with your bitch
Then it's the end of my car
Push-start the engine, let's start from the beginning
With a young nigga from the 'Burgh
Smoking weed, getting money, f*ck what you heard
Know they hate 'cause I'm flyer than I ever been
High off a medicine
Bitch bad, her ass fat, I'll probably let her in
Ball so fuckin' hard I need a letterman
Know a couple niggas that I'm better than
Pussy I don't sweat it or the money cause I get it
Taylor Gang on top just remember that I said it
F*ck this nigga bitch, grab my shit, then I jetted

Up in this bitch and we all faded
F*ck 'bout a bitch, no we don't save her
Nothin' to a boss, do my own thing
It's money over ho's, no I'm no stranger
One more bounce, we got more ounces
One more bounce, we got more ounces
One more bounce, we got more ounces

Girl you ain't fuckin' what you here for?
Got at least 3 zips rolled, all ready
Wiz brought another jar with him
Gin and Drugs got me feelin' like a car hit him
'Round 6 a.m once I hit my dick
Didn't have a rubber so she got to feel this skin
Money stacks stack high, bruh this don't bend
What's up with your friend? Biatch!
Ho, yeah yeah yeah
Feeling like Mitch when the light hit him
Married to the money, let the rice hit him

Up in this bitch and we all faded
