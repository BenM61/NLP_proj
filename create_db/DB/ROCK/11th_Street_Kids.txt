Accidents happens about everyday
But that day special followed by a heat wave
Rush hour just began I ran for my life
I can't afford to miss the bus 
Or I'll go and miss all the fuss
'cause this time it's a must
I'm gonna meet the boys and Suzy
I just can't miss her tonight
Tonight I'm so hot - Gee! I'm so hot

Well, is she tight
Is she in need of a lover like me?
Oh, there she is now!
I gotta go - and give her a great big kiss
And now that I'm in her I don't want to lose her
These moments are takin' me to heaven
But they don't seem to take her anywhere at all
I wonder what is wrong
Please, tell me what is wrong!

Remember all them nites we wrote on the walls that "Punks never die!"
Hot love in the nights, the days we spent underground

Accidents happens about everyday
But that day special ''cause Peter was taken a way and Suzy
She moved to another town
So here I'm all alone in the summer heat
Looking at this empty street
All here's left is writings on the walls
I wonder were all the 11th street kidz are today
Where have they all gone?
