In us you see a couple of song and dance men
I'm the song
I'm the dance

For laughter, joy and happiness, we're advance men
With a song
And a dance

I sing for my supper
I dance for my lunch
I croon when the landlord comes around

For miles around the women and children pass out cold
When my voice hits the air
And my feet hit the ground

Last night
Out in the moonlight
I came to serenade
A very pretty maid
I sang her to sleep with "Asleep in the Deep"
That always makes them collapse
I saw her eyes close, then she started to doze
But she arose when I sounded taps

Which goes to show what women will do when we're around
And my voice hits the air
And my feet hit the ground
