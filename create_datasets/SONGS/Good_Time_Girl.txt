When you find that you don't love her
When all the glitter rubs off of her.
I'll be waitin' just a smile away.
I can see you need some cheerin'
So call on me I'm volunteerin'
All you gotta do is pick up the phone
Tell me your alone and baby 
I'll come runnin'.

I'll be your good time girl
I'll be your sunshine girl
I'll turn your nighttime into day.
I'll be your good time girl
I'll be your sunshine girl
I'll wash your troubles all away.

When you need someone to laugh with
Someone to share things half and half with.
I can make the nighttime fly away.
You don't have to say you love me
Just let me know you're thinkin' of me.
All you gotta do is pick up the phone
Tell me your alone and baby I'll come runnin'.

I'll be your good time girl
I'll be your sunshine girl
I'll turn your nighttime into day.
I'll be your good time girl
I'll be your sunshine girl
I'll wash your troubles all away.
