She sold her love to a modern man
Cause solid currency's the hardest to love
All other modern hells you cover your eye
Don't let the lady finger blow in your hat
Di-di-da

Feel like a daughter
She's a star tonight
Without warning
She gave up
The ghost inside

This gives some matter to shaking her hide
Too late to leave him' are the songs in her car
Di-di-da

Feel like a daughter
She's a star tonight
Without warning
She gave up
The ghost inside

They call it chivalry
Never pull a punch for free
You ever wonder why they had to move on
This phony article
That put you on the floor
A double standard
You envoke when you want

Feel like a daughter
She's a star tonight
Without warning
She gave up
The ghost inside

Was it all for show?
To turn into all of them
Turning a page
Trust me darlin'
I'm carving 'em up through the dust in your town
Crawling over rubble, just to sound me out
Tend to wonder why?
