There's a bridge made of light
That crosses between death and life
Where shadows walk in the sun
And desperate lovers run
One day a child and an angel
Stood on either side
Of a magic river
That there was no crossing
But as they tried
The water began to rise
Then they raised their eyes

And as the river fell away
They built a bridge across forever
Between tomorrow and today
There is a bridge across forever

I've had this dream all my life
That doesn't live in black and white
It has no end it just begins
In distant sands and magenta winds
And my love she is standing by the side
Of a magic river that there is no crossing
Maybe someday when our spirits begins to rise
And light fills our eyes

We will meet again someday
On the bridge across forever
I know that we will find our way
To the bridge across forever
Between tomorrow and today
There is a bridge across forever
I know that we will find our way
To the bridge across forever.
