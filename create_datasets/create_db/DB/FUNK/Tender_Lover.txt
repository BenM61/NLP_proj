Feels good, everybody
Tender lover, tender love

Eleanor Rigby
Spends half her life all alone
No fault of her own
Made a decision
Love has no place in her home
Love it has a right to go

Love has no limit
If you believe in love
It'll open up so
Don't even give in
'Cause if it starts to give
Just hold on
We didn't didn't make it
But love'll get you by
If you only try
Just don't give up on love
'Cause it didn't work out this time

Tender lover, girl, I'm so sorry
Well I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to break your heart
Tender love, so broken hearted
Well I never meant to break your
Break your little tender heart

Don't ever give up
In spite of our love
Love is much too precious
It's greater than both of us
There's more than enough
Keep lookin' for love
Just be a believer
It'll give you what you want

Sky is the limit
If you believe in love
It'll open up so
Don't ever give in
'Cause if it starts to give
Just hold on
We didn't didn't make it
But love'll get you by
If you only try
Just don't give up on love
'Cause it didn't work out this time

(Hook)
My tender lover
Tender lover, tender love
Tender lover, tender love

Love has no limit
If you believe in love
It'll open up so
Don't even give in
'Cause if it starts to give
Just hold on
We didn't didn't make it
But love'll get you by
If you only try
Just don't give up on love
'Cause it didn't work out this time

(Hook)
