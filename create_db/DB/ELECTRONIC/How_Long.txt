How long has this been goin' on
How long has this been goin' on
How long has this been goin' on
How long has this been goin' on

Well, your freinds with their fancy persuasion
Don't' admit that it's part of a scheme
But I can't help but have my suspicion
'Cause I ain't quite as dumb as I seem

Well, you said you were never intending
To break up our scene in this way
But there ain't any use in pretending
It could happen to us any day

How long has this been goin' on
How long has this been goin' on
How long has this been goin' on
How long has this been goin' on

(Repeat)

Well, your freinds with their fancy persuasion
Don't' admit that it's part of a scheme
But I can't help but have my suspicion
'Cause I ain't quite as dumb as I seem

Well, you said you were never intending
To break up our scene in this way
But there ain't any use in pretending
It could happen to us any day

How long has this been goin' on
How long has this been goin' on
How long has this been goin' on
