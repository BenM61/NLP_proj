We're troops of tomorrow
We're hangin' 'round today
We're playin' tough music
'Cause it's hard times money

We need a new solution
We want it quick
We're getting frustrated
It's making us sick

We got a bright future
We got it on the never, never
(Incomprehensible)
We ain't gonna live forever

We're troops of tomorrow
We're hangin' 'round today
We're playin' tough music
'Cause it's hard times money

We gotta stop that dreamin'
We've gotta pick up that gun
We're troops of tomorrow
We've got a new vision run

I sent the troops of tomorrow
I sent the troops of tomorrow
I sent the troops of tomorrow
I sent the troops of tomorrow

I sent the troops of tomorrow
I sent the troops of tomorrow
I sent the troops of tomorrow
I sent the troops of tomorrow
