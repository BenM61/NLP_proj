Bimbombey, Bimbombey
On the way to Bimbombey
There's a hill on the way to Bimbombey
There's a house on the hill and a girl in the house
On the hill on the way to Bimbombey
A house on the hill and a girl in the house
On the hill on the way to Bimbombey

[Chorus:]
Jing-a-ling-a-lyoh (Jing-a-ling-a-lyoh)
Jing-a-ling-a-lyay (Jing-a-ling-a-lyay)
Jing-a-ling-a-ly, jing-a-ling-a-ly
Jing-a-ling-a-lyay-ay-ay 
Jing-a-ling-a-lyay (Jing-a-ling-a-lyay)

There's a store in Bimbombey
There's a ring in the store in Bimbombey
That's where I'll buy the ring for the girl in the house
On the hill on the way to Bimbombey
I'll buy the ring for the girl in the house
On the hill on the way to Bimbombey

[Chorus]

Once I get to Bimbombey
You can bet I will stay in Bimbombey
That's where I'll settle down with the girl in the house
On the hill on the way to Bimbombey
I'll settle down with the girl in the house
On the hill on the way to Bimbombey

[Chorus]

Bimbombey
Bimbombey
