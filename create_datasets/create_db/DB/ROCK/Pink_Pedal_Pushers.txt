Well, she goes struttin' down the street In her sophisticated style
The way she's dressed was a knocking 'em wild
The cats started gazing till they called her out
Her pink pedal pushers was a-knocking 'em out
She wears a-pink pedal pushers, pink pedal pushers
Her pink pedal pushers has made her the queen of them all

She goes drivin' down the street in her brand new car
The cats started gazin' from near and far
She don't cause commotion till she steps outside
The cats get hip and holler, ooh-ooh man alive
She's wearin' pink pedal pushers, pink pedal pushers
Pink pedal pushers has made her the queen of them all

(Oh wop a do)
Pink pedal pushers has made her the queen of the mall

She got the number one phones to high school hop
The older folks said she got to favor the mob
She's got more than I've ever had
She's a rock 'n' roll ditty with a brand new fad
She wears a-pink pedal pushers, pink pedal pushers
Pink pedal pushers has made her the queen of them all

Well, they gave her a part in a high school play
They all chose her to play the old may
Curtain call had the crowd off the floor
Her pink pedal pusher, they stole the show
She wears a-pink pedal pushers, pink pedal pushers
Pink pedal pushers has made her the queen of them all

(How does she go, pop)
Pink pedal pushers has made her the queen of the mall
