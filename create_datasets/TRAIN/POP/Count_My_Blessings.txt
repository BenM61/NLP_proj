In and out
Of situations
I take the good with the bad
Ups and downs
Get complicated
But I don't have the right
To be sad

How about the children who are hungry
And never get to eat
How about the people who are homeless
Sleeping in the street

Every night
Before I go to sleep
I count my blessings
Instead of sheep
I say a prayer
My soul to keep
I count my blessings

When I hear
The sound of complaining
I put my hands to my ears
Think of those
Whose lives have been taken
And thank the Lord I am here

I've got some money in my pocket
A hand I can hold
Somebody standing by me
When the winter gets too cold

I
I'd give some away
Share in my good fortune
Hear
Hear me when I say
I'll give some away

How about the people who are starving
And never get to eat
How about the children in the desert
Dying from the heat
