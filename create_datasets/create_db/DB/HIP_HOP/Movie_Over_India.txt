Plane a where me catch a Indian air-liner
Place a where me land that a Amritsar

Jump pon a taxi them a call a rikshar

The people meet me put them hands together
Woman in a sari man in pajarma
When them meet me them say, "O kith thar naine butchair teek hair"
And then the man who me meet a no the producer
Make one film with the one Amitabh
Make another one with the one Rekha
