It's like oh, oh, oh
The DJ's gonna save us
DJ's gonna save us tonight

Sometimes I feel the world is ending
What if there was no tomorrow
I look around, the walls are caving in
And it feels like we're running out of time

Mista DJ turn it up 'cause I'm about to run this place
Fire fire fire fire
DJ come on put it loud!

Put your, put your hands in the air
And let the DJ save you tonight
There's a party up in here
So let's get it started

It's like oh, (go DJ)
Oh (go DJ)

Tonight the light is shining on me
Only if the world could see me now
'Cause I got all my people with me
And I'm about to hit the spotlight right now

Mista DJ turn it up 'cause I'm about to run this place
Fire fire fire fire
Give them the torch, I said give them the lighter!

Put your, put your hands in the air
And let the DJ save you tonight
