We're gutter punks and vagabonds
Street sweepers and tag alongs
Getting high on 5th Avenue
'Cause we ain't got nothing to lose

The college kids and CEOs
Flunk outs and the "got no hope"
To all the ones at the end of their rope

Listen honey, I'm a lot like you
Don't worry, let me show you what to do, you say

Hey, let's cheers to us
We're gonna be victorious
Don't matter what they say because
We march to a beat of a different drum
Hey, let's cheers to us
Riot girls down on their luck
Shouldn't matter what they say because 
We march to a beat of a different drum

To the mods and the hipster trips
You average joes and you working stiffs
Getting drunk in the hotel room
'Cause we ain't ever had a clue

Supermodels on the boulevard
Your drug dealers and your fresh ass cars
The ones we want, the ones we choose

Listen honey, I'm a lot like you
Don't trip, let us show you what to do, you say

Hey, let's cheers to us
We're gonna be victorious
Don't matter what they say because
We march to a beat of a different drum
Hey, let's cheers to us
Riot girls down on their luck
Shouldn't matter what they say because
We march to a beat of a different drum

Oh na na na, oh na na
Oh na na na, na na na (of a different drum)
Oh na na na, oh na na
Oh na na na, na na na (of a different drum)

We all got something to lose
You only get one life to choose
Sticks and stones, but what does that prove?
What does that prove?
Hey, let's cheer to us

Hey, let's cheers to us
We're gonna be victorious
Don't matter what they say because
We march to a beat of a different drum
Hey, let's cheers to us
Riot girls who don't give no fucks
Doesn't matter what they say because
We march to a beat of a different drum
