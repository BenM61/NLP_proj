It's getting outside, you better come on in, girl, yeah baby
I've got a call for you to ride, you better come on in, girl, yeah
My love is a life saver, I'm tryin' to do both of us a favor
Just come on in, come on in, come on in, now look here

Now I've got you home, can I come on in, girl?
You don't have to sit home alone, can I come on in, girl?
Oh, my love is a life saver, in my soul I know you are able
To know what I'm tryin' to say, show me the easy way

And I'll take care of your love, let me, let me
Let me come on in, come on in, come on in

I want you the whole summer
Ask a friend for your phone number
But I was too scared to phone
That's why I waited so very long, yeah

You put walls around your heart, let me come on in, girl
I love you from the start, can I come on in, girl?
Oh, oh, my love is a life saver, in my soul I know you are able
To know what I'm tryin' to say, show me the easy way

I wanna love you every day, let me come on
Come on in, come on in, let me come on in, come on in, oh

Let me come on in, let me, baby, come on in
I wanna come into your heart, just a lonely boy
It's been a long time
