The Art Of Falling Apart
Falling through at the seams
Living life in a dream
Even smiles make a lie
And I smile all the time

I'm skilled at the art
Of falling apart
It's the holding together
Together forever

Trying all of the vices
Is what's doing the damage
All the good things are bad things
And I'm paying the prices

I'm skilled at the art
Of falling apart
It's the holding together
Together forever

I'm covered in bruises
From mixing with losers
It's the black and the blue
That's seeing me through

My cigarette diet
Means my throat hurts like hell
My friends say I'm dying
But I do it so well

I'm skilled at the art
Of falling apart
It''s the holding together
Together forever
