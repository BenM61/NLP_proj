I know a place where you can know all by yourself
With pretty ladies to below all by herself
It doesn't matter if you don't have much to say
'Cause I've hearded more all simple matter anyway

Another cha cha
Por favor, queremos sabor
Another cha cha
One takes you crazy and everyone sayin' is hot
Come on, it's hot

(Woah)
You can say: you've been working very hard (Oh no)
They say (poor change, don't you get too tired)
We got all this music we will playing it all night
You and other cha cha, it would be all right

Another cha cha
Por favor, queremos sabor
Another cha cha
Music is crazy and everyone sayin' is hot

Please, baby please
Is the same simple game
I look at you, but you won't look at me

Please, baby please
Won't you tell me your name?
Why don't you see what you do to me?
(Woah oh)

Long brass brake

Por favor, queremos sabor
Another cha cha
