I know this will be something I remember in my head
Something I remember
Sharp words push me back, hanging on to anything I can
Anything I can

Why do you tell me only things I want to hear?
Why don't you tell me this could just disappear?

At the same time (At the same time)
You keep tracking treasure down
At the same time (At the same time)
(Tracking treasure down) Tracking treasure down
(Tracking treasure down) Tracking treasure down
At the same time (At the same time)

Cant stop I'm soaked tonight, wanna find something I believe
Something I believe
Open up, take me in, makes no sense, help me understand
Help me understand

Why do you tell me only things I want to hear?
Why don't you tell me this could just disappear?

You tell me of pirate-ships and fairy-tales
You have me wishing that everything was real

At the same time, at the same time
You keep tracking treasure down
At the same time, at the same time, at the same time
At the same time (At the same time)
At the same time

Why do you tell me only things I want to hear?
Why don't you tell me this could just disappear?

At the same time (At the same time)
You keep tracking treasure down
At the same time (At the same time)
(Tracking treasure down) Tracking treasure down
(Tracking treasure down) Tracking treasure down
At the same time (At the same time)
