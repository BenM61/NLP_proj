Staring up into the heavens
In this hell that binds your hands
Will you sacrifice your comfort
Make your way in a foreign land

Wrestle with your darkness
Angels call your name
Can you hear what they are saying
Will you ever be the same

Imminilalo Imminilalo
Imminilalo Imminilalo

Remember, remember
Never forget
All of your life has all been a test
You will find the gate that's open
Even though your spirit's broken

Open up my heart
'Cause my lips to speak
Bring the heavens and the stars
Down to earth for me

Imminilalo Imminilalo
Imminilalo Imminilalo

Imminilalo Imminilalo
Imminilalo Imminilalo

Wrestle with your darkness
Angels call your name
Can you hear what they are saying
Will you ever be the same

Imminilalo Imminilalo
Imminilalo Imminilalo

Imminilalo Imminilalo
Imminilalo Imminilalo
