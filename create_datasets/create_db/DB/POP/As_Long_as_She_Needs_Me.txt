As long as she needs me
I know where I must be
I'll cling on steadfastly
As long as she needs me

As long as life is long
I'll love her right or wrong
And somehow, I'll be strong
As long as she needs me

If you are lonely
Then you will know
When someone needs you
You love them so

I won't betray her trust
Though some folks say I must
I've got to stay true just
As long as she needs me

When you need someone
You love them so

I won't betray her trust
Though people tell me I must
I've gotta stay true just
As long as she needs me
