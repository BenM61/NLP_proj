Hold a moment in time
And look to the skies
And we are frozen in light
Not a second goes by

Is it a waking dream holding me?
You never really know till you know
In the blink of an eye
Hearts will unite

We are one
Find us under the starlight, starlight, starlight
I could die, right here in your arms
We are one
Caught here under the starlight, starlight, starlight
Oh! 'Cause tonight we found heaven in the dark

No silhouette in my mind
It's just you and I
And as the starlight shines
Bodies are blind

It's so natural, unbreakable
Won't ever let you go, let you go
Hand in my hand
Here till the end

We are one
Find us under the starlight, starlight, starlight
I could die, right here in your arms
We are one
Caught here under the starlight, starlight, starlight
Oh! 'Cause tonight we found heaven in the dark

As the new day rises
Lost in our embrace
We are one! 

We are one
Find us under the starlight, starlight, starlight
I could die, right here in your arms
We are one
Caught here under the starlight, starlight, starlight
Oh! 'Cause tonight we found heaven in the dark
