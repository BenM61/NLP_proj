Oceans apart
Day after day
And I slowly go insane
I hear your voice
On the line
But it doesn't stop the pain
I see you next to never
How can we stay forever

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I took for granted
All the times
That I thought would last somehow
I hear the laughter and I taste the tears
But I can't get near you now
Oh can you see it baby
You've got me goin' crazy

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I wonder how we can survive
This romance, but in the end if I'm with you
I'll take the chance

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
(I'll be, I'll be right right here, oh waiting on you)
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I'll be right here waiting for you
Oh, I love you
Oh whatever it takes
Whatever you do
Where ever you go

I'm never leavin' you (I will be waiting)
I'll be right here waiting, for you oh oh, you
