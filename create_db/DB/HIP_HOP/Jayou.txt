Yeah  testing  testing  one two 
Uhh  one 
Press the panic button god 

We be the crew  guess who  the jayou 
Are a double s  I see  we're 
In the place to be  it don't stop 
We got the rhythm that makes your fingers 
Snap  crackle  pop pop  fizz fizz 
We're known to give a show plus handle our bizness 
Stress  we'll destroy 
We're known to make noise as the original b-boys 
In the flesh, greater to the depth 
Creates the ill scenes when we manifest, yes 

I feel the vibe 
I feel the vibe too 
'Cause it's the butter from the crew 
'Cause we original, who 
Want to tussle? 
Flex for the muscle? 
While we kick the style that busts your blood vessels 
With the rhythm 
The ninety-six stylism 
Pick up a pill and feel em kill em with your vocalism 

Yeah, I shoot the gift puffin another cold spliff 
Fools are coming quicker than anna nicole smith 
Malignant metaphors and ganja stay herbs 
We conjugate verbs and constipate nerds like you 
I'm hear to end the conspiracy, fearlessly 
So you can really see the real mc's at hand 
I'm tuna fish on the stick shift 
The eclectic hectic, desperate to set trip 

And for the niggaz who feel, that they're 24-karat 
Plus, the way you're livin' get your underwater baptism 
Believe it or not, it's the rugged and raw 
Put a bullet in the head of four in mount rushmore 

Yeah, release the beast from within, baptize gins 
Keep company with friends that repel sin 
I'm out to win ain't no pretendin', f*ck the first amendment 
My speech was free, the day that my soul descended 

Earthbound, we might sound various 
Some niggaz can rhyme, but they got no character 
So we preparin' you for war, don't give up the fight 
You need to stand up for your rights 

And grab a mic and get loose, produce the juice that keeps the head on 
Collision with the new world order opposition 
Competition, none, there's only one in the universe 
That knows the final outcome 

We got incarcerated minds, men women and enzymes 
Vibin off the rhymes sent from the di-vine essence 
Presence effervescence, not to be contested 
Some miss the message, go ahead and bless this 

So don't mistake us for a crew that used to hit 
We on some underground certified wild style shit 

We be the crew, guess who, and it'll be 
The jayou, ninety-five a.d. 

Be be causin' ramifications, physicians 
Sendin' brothers on grammar vacations, if they don't listen 
Competition, bustin' shots on people basin 
But we can delete constipation 
 
Jurassic, 5, mc's 
And we got the cure for this rap disease 
So come on everybody let's all get down 

'Cause I'm down by law and I know my way around
