Well I'm beginning to see the light
Well I'm beginning to see the light
Some people work very hard
But still they never get it right
Well I'm beginning to see the light
Wanna tell all you people now
Now, now people, I'm beginning to see the light
Hey now, baby, I'm beginning to see the light
Wine in the morning 
And some breakfast at night
Well, I'm beginning to see the light

Here we go again 
Playing the fool again
Here we go again
Acting hard again, all right!

Well I'm beginning to see the light
I wanna tell you now, ooh-ooh-ooh
Hey now, baby, I'm beginning to see the light
It come a bit softer now
I wore my teeth in my hands
So I could mess the hair of the night
Hey, well I'm beginning to see the light
Now, now, now, now, now, now baby I'm beginning to see the night, now
It's comin' softer
Hey now, baby I'm beginning to see the light
I met myself in a dream
And I just want to tell you everything was alright
Hey now, baby, I'm beginning to see the light

Here comes two of you
Which one will you chose?
One is black and one is blue
Don't know just what to do, all right!

Well I'm beginning to see the light
All right now, here she comes!
Yeah, yeah, baby I'm beginning to see the light
Oh, some people work very hard
But still they never get it right
Well I'm beginning to see the light
Come on, let's get a little softer there now
Now, now, baby I'm beginning to see the light
Oh, it's coming around again
Hey now, now, now, now baby I'm beginning to see the light
One more time
There are problems in these times
But ooh, none of them are mine
Oh baby, I'm beginning to see the light

Here we go again
I thought that you were my friend
Here we go again
I thought that you were my friend
