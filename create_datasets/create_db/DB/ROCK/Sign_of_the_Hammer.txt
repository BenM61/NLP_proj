The spell has been broken 
The curse has been lifted
Black is the wind on the heels
Of the gifted
Four sworn to vengeance, 
See the hate in our eyes
Called by the gods, and given a sign

Onward pounding into glory ride
Sign of the hammer be my guide
Final warning all stand aside
Sign of the hammer it's my time

Pounding, pounding, we are back from the dead
Those who denied us are delivered instead
Into the hands of four sworn to ride
Now the people will triumph and live by the sign
