[Chorus]
Call me a player cause I crush a lot 
And I make that money, cause I make it hot
And we use to kick it, shoulda never stop
Girl u know whats up
Cause I'm still after ya, 
And I'm still a bachelor
Are you still alone alone alone alone alone

So how you doin' how you been and how you livin'
You know baby girl your boys place still pimpin'
Plus I heard you got a man with a game plan
With a wedding plan
But you know I'm not the man, I had a different plan
For me and you to follow, a runway model
With a self made baller
But you was caught up with your lil' man a simple life  
You didn't want no fast life, poppin' bottles err night
So I get the movin' just like a g should
Three years later and your boy still livin' good
I cant f*ck baby girl, yea I'm missing times
Creepin' on the low, you could swear we was doin' crimes
It was all good, we use to freak
And f*ck late night in the back seat
Same number you can call me when you get that urge
Still got 25 cars, money to splurge
(Holler at me)

[Chorus]

It's been a minute since we last had a talk
Still hypnotized by the hips and the walk
I'm tryin to figure out who you with, hopefully alone
If thats the case you still got the number to my phone
It might seem like I'm tryin' to holla for some ass
But with the green that I got, I can get that fast
It was something that we had, and I still want it
So if you tryin' to give it to me, let me know I'm on it
I'm still after ya, I'm still a bachelor
If you got a man, understand that I'm not mad at ya
I might have fell off track, but I'm tryin' to bring it back
To the way it was, and if your feeling love

[Chorus]

I'm still here, right here, if u wanna ride
We can take it back how we did it up in '95 
With no strings attached,
I'll put u on your back 
Do those freaky things, make u always wanna come back
Writin' checks without a man, you cant say that your mine
Cause I'm still a free agent
Not tryin' to resign
I'm not a ball player
But I'm a  baller, player
And if your still alone
I'll be callin' later

[Chorus]

I'm not a player, I just crush a lot [Repeat: x2]
Girl you know whats up
You know whats up
I'm not a player, I just crush a lot 
Not a player, I just crush a lot

Are you still alone, are you still alone girl?
