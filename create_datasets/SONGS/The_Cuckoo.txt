Oh, the cuckoo she's a pretty bird
And she warbles as she flies
And she never holler cuckoo
'Til the 4th day of July

Jack of Diamonds, Jack of Diamonds
Well, I've known you of old
Well, you've robbed my poor pockets
Of the silver and the gold

I'm goin' up up on a mountain
I' m gonna build me a whiskey still
And I'll sell you one bottle
For a twenty dollar-bill

I'm going up upon a hillside
And I'm gonna stand lookin' down
So I can see my little baby
Whenever she is walking around

Oh, the cuckoo she's a pretty bird
And she warbles as she flies
Well, she brings us glad tidings
And she never tells no lies

Jack of Diamonds, Jack of Diamonds
You're the meanest card I know
Well, you robbed my poor pockets
And you nearly stole my soul

Well, I'll eat when I'm hungry
And I'll drink when I'm dry
And if some woman don't shoot me
Then I'll live a long time
