So much trouble in the world, I can't watch or read the news
Brings me down so bad babe, when I read the daily blues.
So much heartache in the world, all the sickness and the war
Keep my head down in the sand, 'cause I just can't take no more

I'm talking 'bout trouble - too many reasons for the blues
I'm talking trouble - it's time we had some better news

So much fighting in the world, God and country leads to war
They say we fight for peace, but I just can't take no more
So much killing in the world, terrorist victims by the score
So much trouble in the world babe, and I just can't take no more

I'm talking 'bout trouble - too many reasons for the blues
I'm talking trouble - it's time we had some better news
