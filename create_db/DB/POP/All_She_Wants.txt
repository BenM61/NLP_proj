It's an age-old conversation
That is changing with the times
But it's oh so complicated
If your mother is like mine
All that she wants are the stars and the moon
A son with a wife and a big living room
All she wants
Is another little special arrangement
A peculiar engagement
Got the trophy wife, that's respectable
To avoid any spectacle
It's another simple solution
For my mother's delusion
Get her some adorable pictures done
For her mother in Lebanon

All that she wants (all she wants) all that she wants
All that she wants (all she wants) all that she wants
All that she wants (all she wants) all that she wants
Is another son

To be clear, I'm not a hater
And my wife, I like her, too
Let's be honest with each other
There's some things we always knew
All that she wants is the sun and the moon
The call of the wild and a big silver spoon
All she wants
Is another little special arrangement
A financial engagement
Social standing is stable
But no kids on the table
Just a little harmless diversion
An acceptable version
But I know my heart is in peril
Made a deal with the devil

All that she wants (all she wants) all that she wants
All that she wants (all she wants) all that she wants
All that she wants (all she wants) all that she wants
Is another son

Oh, it seems I was mistaken
Heaven knows just what I've done
All these hateful conversations
Are not helping anyone
My dear wife I have to leave you
There is nothing you can say
You can keep the house without me
Oh, they're better off this way

All that she wants (all she wants) all that she wants
All that she wants (all she wants) all that she wants
All that she wants (all she wants) all that she wants
All that she wants (all she wants) all that she wants
All that she wants (all she wants) all that she wants
Is another son
