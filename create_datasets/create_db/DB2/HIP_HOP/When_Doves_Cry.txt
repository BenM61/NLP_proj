Dig if you will the picture 
Of you and I engaged in a kiss 
The sweat of your body covers G 
Can you my darling 
Can you picture this? 

Dream if you can a courtyard 
An ocean of violets in bloom 
A nigga like me strikes curious poses
They feel the heat 
The heat between me and you 

How can you just leave me standing? 
Alone in a world that's so cold? 
Maybe I'm just too demanding 
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold 
Maybe I'm just like my mother 
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied) 
Why do we scream at each other 
This is what it sounds like 
When doves cry 

Touch if you will my stomach 
Feel how it trembles inside 
Now you've got the butterflies all tied up 
Don't make me chase
Even doves have pride 

How can you just leave me standing? 
Alone in a world so cold? (World so cold) 
Maybe I'm just too demanding 
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold 
Maybe I'm just like my mother 
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied) 
Why do we scream at each other 
This is what it sounds like 
When doves cry 

How can you just leave me standing? 
Alone in world that's so cold
Maybe I'm just too demanding (Maybe, maybe I'm like my father) 
Maybe I'm just like my mother (Maybe I'm just like my mother) 
She's never satisfied (She's never, never satisfied) 
Why do we scream at each other (Why do we scream, why) 
This is what it sounds like 
When doves cry

Maybe I'm just like my mother 
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied) 
Why do we scream at each other (Why do we scream at each other)
This is what it sounds like 
When doves cry
