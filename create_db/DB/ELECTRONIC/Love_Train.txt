You're a work of art
You're the Trevi Fountain
You're a golden heart
You're the highest mountain.
You bring me flowers every day of my life
You save me from the worry and the strife.

Take me in your arms
baby
baby
I'm on a winning streak
When I met you I reached my peak.
Your perfect view makes me feel brand-new
yeah
Well
you're just right to keep me up all night
up all night.

Working all the time to make you mine all mine
yeah
Riding the love train
stroke it up
riding the love train.
Lovin' all the time to keep you feeling fine
yeah
Riding the love train
stroke it up
riding the love train.

You make time stand still
Your children laughter
love's overspill
I'll come running after.
You bring the spring right through my door
You're everything that's worth living for.

Thrill me with your charms
baby
baby
baby
me knees are weak
I need you now
don't play hide and seek.
No times long enough
leaving you is tough
You're just right to keep me up all night
up all night.

Refrain

Keep the flames burning
let your spirit fly
Stay on the right track
baby
till the day I die
Keep the coal coming.

Baby
baby
I'm on a winning streak
When I met you I reached my peak.
Your perfect view makes me feel brand-new
yeah
Well
you're just right to keep me up all night
up all night.

Refrain (2x)
