Back in the day when nothing really mattered to me
I only showed my eyes what they wanted to see
And everything around me seemed to never change
Looking for an easy way out someone to blame
Why does it work this way still today
You want to take somebody down along the way
But I won't let that one be me
Cause I don't want the drama it brings
See today isn't back in the day anymore
I know a little more than I did before
So don't forget before you start bringing me down
What goes around always comes back around

You can't bring me down
Till you hear what I'm trying to say
You can't bring me down
I'll  never turn the other way
You can't bring me down
What is it you're trying to say
You can't bring me down
It's not like I'm running away

So you think you can see inside my mind
You probably could if you just took a little time
I know exactly what you're trying to say
He's sittin' there saying Satan thinks i'm playing a game
So i can't comprehend in my mind
Just why we can't leave it all behind
So come on and stand beside the border line
Cause tonight is the night we climb

You can't bring me down
Till you hear what I'm trying to say
You can't bring me down
I'll never turn the other way
You can't bring me down
What is it you're trying to say
You can't bring me down
It's not like I'm running away

Why can't we feel what it's saying for us to be real
Why can't we see what it's saying for us to believe
Why do we say all of these things that bring us down

You can't bring me down
Till you hear what I'm trying to say
You can't bring me down
I'll never turn the other way
You can't bring me down
What is it you're trying to say
You can't bring me down
It's not like I'm running away

It's not like I'm running away

You can't bring me down
