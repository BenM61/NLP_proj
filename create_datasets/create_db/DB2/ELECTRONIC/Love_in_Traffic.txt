Love in traffic
Robot police
They like pornographic
Girls and dope beats

Love in traffic

Love in traffic
Skylight nowhere
Soporofic

Put a gun in my hand and pretend
You don't care
Said I'm walkin' through you baby
Please stay silent
Put a gun in my hand and pretend
You don't care
Ooh I'm walkin' through you baby
Please stay silent

Love in traffic
Ultra violent
Red electric

Put a gun in my hand and pretend
You don't care
Put a gun in my hand and pretend
You don't care
I've been thinkin' and drinkin' that's
Why I'm a mess
I've been thinkin' and drinkin' that's
Why I'm a mess

Put a gun in my hand and pretend
You don't care
Ooh I'm walkin' through you baby
Please stay silent

Love in traffic

Love in traffic
On my way to oblivion

Love in traffic
