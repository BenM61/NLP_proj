Broken hearts will never meet again
We can try sometimes we'll pretend
Back inside, inside of you again
My soul is lost and now i will pretend

And now there's nothing left
There's nothing known
There's nothing seen
And no more

All i ever wanted was love
All i ever wanted was something special

Here we go we're going in the rain again
The storm is raging green envy with my friends
Black in the night back in another day
We creep up and we sum the sun away
Not known
