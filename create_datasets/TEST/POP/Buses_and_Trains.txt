Hey mum! Why didn't you tell me? 
Why didn't you teach me a thing or two? 
Did you just let me go out, into the world? 
You never thought to share what you knew. 

So I walked under a bus, I got hit by a train. 
Keep falling in love, which is kinda the same. 
I've sunk out at sea, crashed my car, gone insane. 
And it felt so good, I want to do it again. 

Hey mum! Why didn't you want me? 
'Cause I found boys were something I should have known. 
They're like chocolate cake, like cigarettes. 
I know they're bad for me, but I just can't leave them alone. 


And I walked under a bus, I got hit by a train. 
And it felt so good, I want to do it again. 
I want to do it again, I want to do it again, hey hey! 
Ooh, think I'm so good? Hey! 

Hey mum! Since we're talking, what was it like when you were young? 
Has the world changed, or is it still the same? 
A man can kill, and still be the sweetest fun! 


And I walked under a bus, I got hit by a train, 
And it felt so good, I want to do it again.
