Olivia, the slave, got distracted on her way to grandmother's house
A wolf in lamb's clothing came, blew her mind and changed her ways
And now she's turned out, lost and turned out, lost and turned out

She's spending most of her time
Walking the streets
She has a certain quota to fill
He wants to buy a new Seville

Olivia, the slave, got distracted on her way to grandmother's house
A wolf in lamb's clothing came, blew her mind and changed her ways
And now she's turned out, lost and turned out, lost and turned out

What is the world coming to
So many are used and abused
There's over 10 million girls
Who are lost in this world

What will your kin folks say
Olivia, the slave
It must be breaking their hearts in two
Listen close, they're calling you
(Olivia, Olivia, Olivia, Olivia)

Olivia, the slave, got distracted on her way to grandmother's house
A wolf in lamb's clothing came, blew her mind and changed her ways
And now she's turned out, lost and turned out

Olivia, where's your will?
(She's lost and turned out)
Don't buy that guy no Seville
(Lost and turned out)

Olivia, the slave
(Lost and turned out)
Don't let him drag you to your grave
(Lost and turned out)

Olivia, where's your mind?
(Lost and turned out)
He pulls you down all the time
(Lost and turned out)

Olivia, stop and think
(Lost and turned out)
He's taking your cash to his bank
(Lost and turned out)

Olivia, break the chains
(Lost and turned out)
Stop using your body and use your brain
(Lost and turned out)
