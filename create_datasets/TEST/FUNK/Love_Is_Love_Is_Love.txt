I don't mean to start an argument
Yeah, I'm just trying to spark a conversation
A lack of love can make a tyrant, oh yeah
Time to open up the floodgate
Eradicate the insanity
With my unoriginal epiphany

So let me shout it for the whole world
Oh, love is love is love is love is love is love (is love is love is love is love)
Let me shout it for the whole world
Love is love is love is love is love is love (love is love is love is love is love)
Ooh, let's start a revolution ooh ooh ooh (love is love is love is love is love)
Oh, love is love is love is love is love is love

These politics and religion
Everyday they're starting wars
And we believe we're not the hateful, no no
When we can dance with the worst of them
When we can sing with our enemies
Then we will know that times are changing
Or won't we?

So let me shout it for the whole world
Oh, love is love is love is love is love is love (is love is love is love is love)
Oh let me shout it for the whole world
Love is love is love is love is love is love (love is love is love is love is love)
Ooh, let's start a revolution ooh ooh ooh (love is love is love is love is love)
Ooh, love is love is love is love is love is love

Hate the hate but love the hater
They'll come around sooner or later
Ooh I believe it with my whole heart
Hate the hate but love the hater
They'll come around sooner or later
Oh I believe it with my whole heart

Let me shout it for the whole world (love is love is love is love)
Oh, love is love is love is love is love is love (love is love is love is love)
Oh, let me shout it for the whole wide world (love is love is love is love)
Love is love is love is love is love is love (love is love is love is love)
Oh, let's start a revolution, ooh ooh ooh (love is love is love is love)

Yeah, love is love is love is love is love is love (love is love is love is love)
Oh, love is love is love is love is love is love (love is love is love is love)
Oh, love is love is love is love (love is love is love is love)
Oh, love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love (love is love is love)
Oh love is love is love is love is love (love is love is love is love)

Hate the hate but love the hater (love is love is love is love)
Hate the hate but love the hater (love is love is love is love)
Hate the hate but love the hater (love is love is love is love)
Hate the hate but love the hater (love is love is love is love)
