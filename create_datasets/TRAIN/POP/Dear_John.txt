Dear John (Dear John)
Oh, how I hate to write
Dear John (Dear John)
I must let you know tonight
That my love for you has gone
There's no reason to go on
For tonight I wed another, dear John

I was overseas in battle when the postman came to me.  And he handed 
me a letter. Aw, I was happy as I could be.  You see, the fighting was all over and 
the battles, they'd all been won.  Then I, I opened up the letter and it started "Dear
John."

(Dear John)
SPOKEN:  Will you please send back my picture?  You see, my husband wants it 
now.  When I tell you who I'm wedding you won't care, dear, anyhow.  Now the 
ceremony has started and I'll wed your brother Don.  Please wish us happiness 
forever, dear John.
