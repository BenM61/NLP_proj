Soothe me, soothe me, soothe me, soothe me, soothe me
Everybody come on, clap your hands, will you?
Just a minute, I like it like that

Soothe me baby, soothe me
Soothe me with your kindness
Though you know your powerful loving is
Soothing to me, one more time

Soothe me baby, soothe me
Soothe me with your kindness
Though you know your powerful loving is
Soothing to me, over here

Oh, how I used to rumble 
And how I used to roam
Oh, since I met this baby I'm mad
And all I want do is stay at home
Everybody now

Soothe me baby, soothe me
Soothe me with your kindness
Though you know your powerful loving is
Soothing to me, now listen to me 

I used to hire a lot of girls
Had them big and small
Since I've met this baby of mine
I don't want no other girl at all

Soothe me baby, soothe me
Soothe me with your kindness
Though you know your powerful loving is
Soothing to me, oh yeah

Soothe me, soothe me, soothe me, soothe me
Soothe me, soothe me, soothe me, soothe me, soothe me
Come on now let's do this again
That's it, come on now put your hands together
Everybody come on now
Soothe me, soothe me, soothe me, soothe me, baby
You got to soothe me, you got to pull, yeah
You gotta soothe me, soothe me
