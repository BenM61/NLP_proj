Hey, little girl, comb your hair, fix your make-up
Soon he will open the door
Don't think because there's a ring on your finger 
You needn't try any more
For wives should always be lovers too
Run to his arms the moment he comes home to you
I'm warning you

Day after day, there are girls at the office 
And the men will always be men
Don't stand him up with your hair still in curlers 
You may not see him again
Wives should always be lovers too
Run to his arms the moment he comes home to you
He's almost here 

Hey, little girl, better wear something pretty
Something you wear to go to the city
Dim all the lights, pour the wine, start the music
Time to get ready for love

It's time to get ready for love
Yes, it's time to get ready for love
It's time to get ready, kick your shoes off, baby
