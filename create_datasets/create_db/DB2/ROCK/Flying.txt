I'm flying high
Across the sky
I'm flying high
Across the sky
I'm flying high
I'm flying high

I'm the person
In charge of the aircraft
I'm the pilot
We're hit by a flash
When I tell you to
Fasten the seat belts
Say a prayer
Cause we're going to crash

Calling air traffic control
Calling air traffic control
Calling air traffic control

I'm flying high
Across the sky
I'm flying high
Across the sky
I'm flying high
I'm flying high

Move beyond
After hot demolition
Bring the angels
To take us away
Soon we travel
Inside tunnel vision
In the garden of eden
We play

Calling air traffic control
Calling air traffic control
Calling air traffic control

I'm flying high
Across the sky
I'm flying high
Across the sky
I'm flying high
I'm flying high

Calling air traffic control
Calling air traffic control
Calling air traffic control

I'm flying high
Across the sky
I'm flying high
Across the sky
I'm flying high
I'm flying high
