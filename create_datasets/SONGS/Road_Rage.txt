If all you've got to do today is find peace of mind
Come round you can take a piece of mine
And if all you've got to do today is hesitate,
Come here, you can leave it late with me.

You could be taking it easy on yourself
You should be making it easy on yourself,
'cause you and I know,
It's all over the front page, you give me road rage,
Racing through the best days,
It's up to you boy you're driving me crazy,
Thinking you may be losing your mind.

If all you've got to prove today is your innocence,
Calm down, you're as guilty as can be,
But as all you've got to lose, alludes to yesterday,
Yesterday's through, now do anything you please.

You could be taking it easy on yourself
You should be making it easy on yourself
'cause you and I know,
It's all over the front page you give me road rage
Racing through the best days,
It's up to you boy you're driving me crazy,
Thinking you may be losing your mind.
You're losing your mind.

You, you've been racing through the best days
You, you've been racing through the best days.
Space age, road rage, fast lane,

And if all you've got to do today is find peace of mind
Come here, you can take a piece of mine.

You could be taking it easy on yourself
You should be making it easy on yourself
'cause you and I know,
It's all over the front page, you give me road rage,
Racing through the best days,
It's up to you boy you're driving me crazy,
Thinking you may be losing your mind.

But you and I know,
We all live in the space age, coming down with road rage,
Racing through the best days
It's up to you boy you're driving me crazy,
Thinking you may be losing your mind.
It's not over, it's not over, it's not over,
It's not over, it's not over, it's not over, you and I know
We all live in the space age, you give me road rage,
Racing to the best days
It's up to you boy you're driving me crazy,
Thinking you may be losing your mind.
Losing your mind
