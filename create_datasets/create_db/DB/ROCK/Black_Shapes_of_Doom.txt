Deep into the darkness the world keeps turnin'
All my soul, within me burnin'
Raven's been knockin' at my door
With all the hopes that have flown before
Nothing more

Colors begin to run on you
Black shapes of doom
Colors begin to run on you
Black shapes of doom

Eyes of a demon that is dreamin'
This ain't no living human being
Raven's been knockin' at my door
With all the hopes that have flown before
Nevermore

Colors begin to run on you
Black shapes of doom
Colors begin to run on you
Black shapes of doom

Heard all the lying, my soul has spoken
Leave my loneliness, loneliness unbroken
Raven's been knockin' at my door
With all the hopes that have flown before
Evermore

Colors begin to run on you
Black shapes of doom
Colors begin to run on you
Black shapes of doom
