Trick you ain't gotta like me
Oh you his wifey
I think your man like me
he had me in the car
with his hand on my bra
breathing in my face 
saying

I'm just trying to keep you in check

up happy homes like Trick 
so mo easy joe you so and so
I'm a superwoman you don't know
Damn I look good 
Talk trash in your hood
and if you man want you

Slip and slide Miss Trina

like a rock and roll singer

all up in my gut playa what

Hey playa what's the word
watch my hips don't you like these cruves
I want to crib in the deep suburbs
2 dogs and a mocking bird 
Versae sprad on my water
and give me some head give me some head
Miss Trina likes kicks all red and I'm the first to say 
I'm the badest chick
