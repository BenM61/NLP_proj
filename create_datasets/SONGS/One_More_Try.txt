How can I understand
All those things that you do to me
When I just don't think it's right

When I look into your eyes
I gotta run away from them
'Cause I just can't win this fight, no

Ooh, I can't seem to reach you
But you're gonna hear
What I've got to say

One more try
Just forgive and forget
'Cause it's not over yet, oh
One more try
Just don't throw love away

Tell me that you didn't mean
All those things that you said to me
Spoke your mind but not your heart

Back when everything was alright
I stopped you from fallin'
You know how much I cared

Yeah, I'm gonna have to face it
'Cause I keep holdin' on
To something that's not there

One more try
Just forgive and forget

'Cause it's not over yet, oh
One more try
Just don't throw love away

Even in the darkest nights
I held you beside me
It was easy when we tried

It's so hard to keep inside
I wanna tell everybody
I've got nothing left to hide, oh

Yeah, please don't make me hate you
Since you've kicked around
In oh so many ways, yes

One more try
Just forgive and forget
'Cause it's not over yet, oh
One more try
Just don't throw love away

One more try
Just forgive and forget
'Cause it's not over yet, oh, oh
One more try
Don't throw love away

Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa
One more try
Don't throw love away
