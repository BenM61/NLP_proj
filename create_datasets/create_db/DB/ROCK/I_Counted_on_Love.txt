I'm hangin' on, cause I hate letting go (I hate letting go)
I'm not that strong, but you already know; how I hate letting go
We believed that dreams came true, now that picture's torn in two

I counted on love but love will never cry for me
I counted on love but love will never lie for me
I counted on love but lover say goodbye for me
I counted on love

Some great defender, is that what you need? To heal not to bleed
Some great pretender, shouting
"Set yourself free, Set yourself free"
Why do memories have to be like a lock without a key

I counted on love but love will never cry for me
I counted on love but love will never lie for me
I counted on love but lover say goodbye for me

I was flying oh so high
Now I'm trying not to cry
I was trying, but I'm dying, 'cause I hate letting go

I counted on love but love will never cry for me
I counted on love but love will never lie for me
I counted on love but lover say goodbye for me

I counted on love I counted on you
