Measure for measure
Your love's so much pleasure
Like a haunting melody
It came inside and captured me

And I'm so happy
You're the rhythm of my life
You and I together will stand the test of time

(You know how to love me)
Give me more love, give me more time
I can't understand it
Maybe you've found someone new
Tell me what did I do wrong
What did I do

Looking into your eyes now
I don't see the love we had
I don't see compassion
I don't see anything

[Chorus]
Give me just a little more love
Some more to tide me over
Give me just a little more passion
Give me just a little more love

And a little more time
I don't see the reason
Why you should be so unfair
But I have seen it coming
Seen it hanging in the air

Baby when you hold me
You don't touch me like you did
But still I want you by my side
Baby I'll do anything

[Chorus]

I can see you're slipping away from me
But I still feel the magic sometimes
When we touch
You and me, it has to be
'Cause baby without you I don't think that I can carry on

[Chorus x4]
