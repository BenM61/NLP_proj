Gray Jane was a riverchild
Born down by the river wild
Said, hey, what I wanna be
Nobody's gonna intervene

And she wants you but you won't do
And it won't leave you alone
And the rain falls on the wrong year
And it won't leave you alone
It won't leave you alone

Could be that he's into you
Could be that the obverse is true
Struck down as a summerchild
Ten steps just to run a mile

And he wants you but you won't do
And it won't leave you alone
And the rain falls on the wrong year
And it won't leave you alone
It won't leave you alone
It won't leave you alone

The spirit's willin'
Flesh is getting bored
Speakers blaring out some long forgotten chord
Some misbegotten, long forgotten chord

Sing me some eidolon
And I'll sleep all the winter long
'Til then I can only be
Nobody's gonna intervene

And she wants you but you won't do
And it won't leave you alone
And the rain falls on the wrong year
And it won't leave you alone
It won't leave you alone
It won't leave you alone
It won't leave you alone
