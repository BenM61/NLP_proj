SEND MARTYN JOHN RINGTONES TO YOUR CELLPHONE 

I don't want to know 'bout evil, I only want to know about love 
I don't want to know 'bout evil, I only want to know about love 

Sometimes it gets so hard to listen 
Hard for me to use my eyes 
And all around the gold is glistening 
Making sure it keeps me down to size

I'm waiting for the plains to tumble 
Waiting for the towns to fall 
I'm waiting for the cities to crumble 
Waiting till the sea ?...?

Yes, it's getting hard to listen 
Hard for us to use our eyes 
'Cause all around the gold is glistening 
Making sure it keeps us hypnotised
