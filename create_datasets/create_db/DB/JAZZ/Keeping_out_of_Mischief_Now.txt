Don't even go to a movie show
If you're not by my side
I stay home by my radio
But I'm satisfied
All my flirtin' days are gone
On the level from now on

Don't go for any excitement now
Books are my best company
All my opinions have changed somehow
Old-fashioned as can be
When you really learn to care
There's a thrill in Solitaire

Keepin' out of mischief now
Really am in love, and how!
I'm through playing with fire
It's you whom I desire

All the world can plainly see
You're the only one for me
I've told them in advance
They can't break up our romance
Living up to every vow
I'm keepin' out of mischief now

All the world can plainly see
That you're the only one for me
Say I've told them, told them in advance
That they can't break up our romance
Living up to every vow
I'm keepin', keepin' out of mischief now
