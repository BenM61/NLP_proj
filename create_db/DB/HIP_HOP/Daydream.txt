All I do is think about you and me
Talking on the phone til the quarter to 3
Walking in the park on a saturday
Catch the bus back 'cause we walked too far away
All I do is think about the way you kiss
When I'm all alone is you that I miss
That's when I realize that I'm caught up in a daydream, daydream

Early morning baby got you on my mind like crazy
Feeling good, but I couldn't sleep and the night before I couldn't even eat
(I can't compete)
With the spell you put on me
All my thoughts are running wild, but it's like that when you fall in love

All I do is think about you and me
Talking on the phone til the quarter to 3
Walking in the park on a saturday
Catch the bus back 'cause we walked too far away
All I do is think about the way you kiss
When I'm all alone is you that I miss
That's when I realize that I'm caught up in a daydream, daydream

I can't stop thinking of you, tell me what's a girl to do, yeah
(you on my mind, not all the time, it's really true that love is blind)
'cause I can't see nothing, but you lovin' me
Daydream, daydreamin', daydreamin', daydreamin'

All I do is think about you and me
Talking on the phone til the quarter to 3
Walking in the park on a saturday
Catch the bus back 'cause we walked too far away
All I do is think about the way you kiss
When I'm all alone is you that I miss
That's when I realize that I'm caught up in a daydream, daydream
(repeat x3)

You and me
Saturday, catch the bus back
Far away
The way you kiss, when I'm all alone it's you that I miss...
