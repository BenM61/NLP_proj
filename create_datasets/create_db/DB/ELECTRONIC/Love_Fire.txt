Fire fire
Fire fire
Fire fire fire fire
Can't put it out with water

Keeps on burning
Keeps on burning
Keeps on burning burning burning
In my soul

Your love is like a burning fire
It keeps on burning burning burning
In my soul
This love of mine it's my one desire
It's gonna set my soul on fire
It'll never grow cold

Fire fire fire
Fire fire fire
Keeps on burning burning burning
In my soul

Your love is so kind to I
So good good
It'll never grow cold
This love of mine it's my one desire
It's gonna set my soul on fire
It'll never grow cold

Fire fire
Fire fire
Fire fire fire fire
Can't put it out with water

Keeps on burning
Keeps on burning
Keeps on burning burning burning
In my soul
