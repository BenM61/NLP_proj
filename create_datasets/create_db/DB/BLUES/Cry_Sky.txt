Cry sky please let your tears fall on me
Wash me, heal me, help me feel clean
I've lost many things I've always loved
Cry sky

Something I don't understand
If this is part of your plan
Just let your big waters fall
'Til I make sense of it all
Cry sky

My heart has grown heavy with pain
This world won't ever be the same
Mercy, if you know my name
Give me a sign
Cry sky

Something I don't understand
If this is part of your plan
Just let your big waters fall
'Til I make sense of it all
Cry sky

Something I don't understand
If this is part of your plan
Just let your big waters fall
'Til I make sense of it all
Cry sky
