No I won't, no I won't, no I won't
I won't let you move that way
'Cause I don't, no I don't
I don't let you move that way
No I won't, no I won't
I won't stand here whilst you sway
No I don't anymore

No I won't, no I won't, no I won't
I won't let you move that way
'Cause I don't, no I don't
I don't let you move that way
No I won't, no I won't
I won't stand here whilst you sway
No I don't anymore

You don't take me dancing anymore
Oh, you don't take me dancing anymore
Oh it's been a long time
Since I've been on the floor
Oh, it's been a long time
Since I've been on the floor

No I won't, no I won't, no I won't
I won't let you move that way
'Cause I don't, no I don't
I don't let you move that way
No I won't, no I won't
I won't stand here whilst you sway
No I don't anymore

You don't take me dancing anymore
Oh it's been a long time
Since I've been on the floor
You don't take me dancing anymore
Oh it's been a long time
Since I've been on the floor

There's something dark in me
I can't live with these wounds
Grab me by the feet
And throw me into the groove

No I won't, no I won't, no I won't
I won't let you move that way
'Cause I don't, no I don't
I don't let you move that way
No I won't, no I won't
I won't stand here whilst you sway
No I don't anymore

You don't take me dancing anymore
Oh it's been a long time
Since I've been on the floor
You don't take me dancing anymore
Oh it's been a long time
Since I've been on the floor
Oh, you don't take me dancing anymore
You don't take me dancing anymore
You don't take me dancing anymore
You don't take me dancing anymore
