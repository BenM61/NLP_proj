I met a roach in America
His family had a massive tree
They live just about everywhere
He was big in America
He was big in America

I met a vet in America
He was alive, he was in overdrive
He'd just been around everywhere
He was big in America
He was big in America

And when you're big in America
You like to live in America
You won't be on your own
And since you've big in America
You might as well make America your home

Big in America

I met a girl in America
She wore the pants 'cross a big expanse
She was whippin' men everywhere
She was big in America
She was big in America

And when you're big in America
You like to live in America
You won't be on your own
And since you've big in America
You might as well make America your home

Big in America
Big in America
Big in America
Big in America
