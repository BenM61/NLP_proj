And does it hurt
That you finally found yourself
And does it hurt
That you find a bit of wealth
Black coffee for my mood
Can you make me shine
Lonely sweet stuff
Come walking
Nick of time
Don't look at me like a tourist
The dog's got teeth
All the signs are loaded
All the signs are loaded
All the signs are loaded

And does it help
That you finally found yourself
And does it help
That you crawled out of your shell
I wake in a better place
Let me in your head
Blow your horn in the dark
There's someone there
And there's a white stretch limo parked on
A single line
Premium tequila
Diamond jigsaw
Makes me feel fine

And does it help
That you finally found yourself
And does it help
That you crawled out of your shell
I wake in a better place
Let me in your head
Blow your horn in the dark
There's someone there

And does it help
That you finally found yourself
And does it help
That you crawled out of your shell
I wake in a better place
Let me in your head
Blow your horn in the dark
There's someone there
And there's a white stretch limo parked on
A single line
Premium tequila
Diamond jigsaw
Makes me feel fine

And does it help (repeat)
And does it help (repeat)
