I'm not the one to stay up all night
But I am the one to turn off the light
I'm not the one to make it all come true
But I am the one who's good at two
Say you just don't care but you still want to try it (then try it) 
Say you just don't care but you still want to try it (then try it)

Now I told you so but you didn't believe
Now you gotta goal that you didn't achieve
And I don't care I can't say the word
It's not my fault I didn't get past third
Say you just don't care but you still want to try it (then try it) 
Say you just don't care but you still want to try it
(then try it)

It's the death of rock 'n' roll and I'm killin' it
It's the death of rock 'n' roll and I'm killin' it

It's the death of rock 'n' roll and I'm...killin' it!
