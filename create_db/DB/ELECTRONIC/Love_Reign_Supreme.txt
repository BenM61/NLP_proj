Do you keep for a relic
Every ticket in your pocket
For a time you eed reminding
Of the wedding and the binding?

Will you cherish every barb
That caught you soft and unprotected
Like a souvenir collected
Of the harrow and the hiding?

You are more than the sum
Of the numbers you've been done
And it fits to be kind
Even as your chest is bleeding

And may love reign supreme in your heart

Hold on to what you know
You light the room, you give it all
Take with you when you go
The smile that you've been sketching
On my face
And if you slip again
The nearest truth is when you do
And as you slip away
I'm waiting here
For everything to change

WIll you write me a card when you
Reach your destination?
I won't take it as a white flag
Or a sign of hesitation

Just a temporary token
I'll be keeping in my pocket
WIth a Biro and a lighter
'til it smacks of desperation

We are more than the sum
Of the numbers we've been done
And it's right to be kind
Even as your chest is bleeding

And may love reign supreme in your heart
May love reign supreme in your heart

Hold on to what you know
You light the room
You give it all
Take with you when you go
The smile that you've been
Sketching on my face
And if you slip again
The nearest truth is when you do
And as you slip away

I'm waiting here
For everything to change
