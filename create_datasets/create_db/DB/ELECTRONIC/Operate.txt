Baby come lay your head down
I don't want to know what you did before
Baby come lay your head down
Every little thing that you're looking for
Oh oh, the war you started
Oh oh, the lines are forming

Call me the doctor
Make me the doctor
Follow the lights down
And I'll be the one, I'll be the one
Operate, operate oh, operate, operate oh

Baby don't let your head down
I don't wanna hear what you say no more
Baby don't let your head down
Anything you want I could take you for
Oh oh, but not the falling
Oh oh, the love you wanted"

Call me the doctor
Make me the doctor
Follow the lights down
And I'll be the one, I'll be the one
Operate, operate oh, operate, operate oh

Heal in the tired sea
Broken your lies set free
Now that it's time to leave
Don't say a prayer for me

Call me the doctor
Make me the doctor
Follow the lights down
And I'll be the one, I'll be the one
Operate, operate oh, operate, operate oh
