My boss he's a probable bore.
Put me hands and knees on scrubable floor.
Do it right receive the lions share bliss.
Know all too well just where that ration is.

Learned a lot about the company doe.
Learned less about receiving it though.
Saw how it came to those who always sat pretty.
Don't need it.
Supply and demand.

My girl had a probable cause or so she said and took a probable pause.
I was dumped for occupying her time.
I asked her why and what was next in line.

She said "Shiny hair that's my life ambition
But I'll devote my time to a new omission the rizzle-razzle kitsch of paranoid city".
Don't need it.
Supply and demand.
Supply and demand.
