All I feel is in this data stream
I see the eyes in the computer screen
Misinformation is surrounding me
It brings me down, I'm on my knees.

I need to get on higher frequencies
I wanna live inside the mystery
I need your silence to hide in the night
To understand and never wonder why

The crowd goes beep beep beep
My phone goes beep beep beep
The world goes beep beep beep
But you go ooh ooh ahh
Ooh ooh ahh

My car goes beep beep beep
The time goes beep beep beep
The world goes beep beep beep
But you go ooh ooh ahh
Ooh ooh ahh

I see a shadow in the datasphere
I feel a change in the atmosphere
I hear the calling and its crystal clear
Time to disengage, to disappear

The jury's out and the rewards are in
I crunch the numbers and they fell within
The range of danger for a forward mind
A forward body falling out of time

The crowd goes beep beep beep
My phone goes beep beep beep
The world goes beep beep beep
But you go ooh ooh ahh
Ooh ooh ahh

My car goes beep beep beep
The time goes beep beep beep
The world goes beep beep beep
But you go ooh ooh ahh
Ooh ooh ahh
