There was a time when I believed in you
Oh, and nothing wrong that you could ever do.
But you've changed, and you know it's true.
I'm losing the faith that I had in you.

I was so in love, till I was blind.
No, I could never believe that cheatin' was on your mind.
Oh, you've changed, and you know it's true.
I'm losing the faith that I had in you.

Oh, I gave you my heart, gave you all my love.
And I asked for nothing, nothing in return.
I was so happy with you, baby, thinkin' you were mine.
Oh, but how much, how much I paid to learn.

Oh, how I suffered since finding out you, baby,
You were all you cared about.
Oh, you've changed and you know it's true.
I'm losing the faith that I had in you.

Oh, you've changed. Yes, you really changed.
And I'm losing the faith that I had,
Losing the faith that I had,
Losing the faith that I had in you.
