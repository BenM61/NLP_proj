I used to stand strong and defiant to the wind,
Like a bird of storm in any currents,
I'd spread my wings
I used to ride them furious waves singing
To no country nor man will I ever be slave!

But now no Blast, no breeze will billow my sail,

I used to say alone is how one travels best,
Home is where I stand, don't need
Anything else.
And I never knew
This ease could leave
I never thought I'd say,
Please show me the way.

'Cause now no blast, no breeze will billow my sail
'Cause now no moon, no stars will show the way

I used to stand strong and defiant to the wind,
Like a bird of storm in any currents,
I'd spread my wings

But now no blast, no breeze will billow my sail
But now no moon, no stars will show me the way
