Sun lights up the day time
You light up my life
The hand that calls you forward
Is the hand that leaves me behind

And I stand on the ocean shore
Like an old black and white movie
Love is, love is lost, again tonight

Hold me, hold me tonight
Hold me, hold me tonight

you've got a book like this
To keep me alive
And if it's not a rainy day
You simply don't go outside

And you're tired of everything
All of the girls and the boys
And you're tired of everything
All of your precious toys

Hold me, hold me tonight
Hold me, hold me tonight

Sun lights up the daytime
You light up my life
The hand that calls you forward
Is the hand, that leaves me behind

Hold me, hold me tonight
Hold me, hold me tonight
