Oh, f*ck the ancient ways
They are heretofore
Show no claim

Oh, got the time, won't seek
They are oh still coming to beat the street
(At the station)

The city feeds us all like babes
And we've taken a bow (at the station)

Oh, shape the fight of sound
Become beautifully bound to the ground

Oh, f*ck the ancient ways
They are ringing doorbells, they ran it by waste
(At the station)

The city needs us and all our names
Enterprise in her eyes (at the station)

But beneath us an empire grows
Every stage we align (at the station)

To be beaten by the weight of it
They are to be beaten by the weight
(At the station)

Come be people and enjoy our glow
Every change we allow
(At the station)

The city sees us all like babes
And we've taken a vow
(At the station)

To be beaten by the weight of it
They are beaten by the weight
(At the station)

Should we seek them for the sake of it?
May we greet them right away
