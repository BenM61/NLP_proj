Cause I can't live this nightmare
And I won't live this nightmare
I won't lie

I do what I want
I do what I need
Do whatever will help me sleep

I could never be that cold, my dear
Cause I can't live this nightmare
And I won't live this nightmare
I can't lie to keep you here
I could never be that cold, my dear
Cause I can't live this nightmare
And I won't live this nightmare

You do as you please
Do whatever will help you sleep)

I won't lie to keep you here
I could never be that cold, my dear
Cause I can't live this nightmare
And I won't live this nightmare
If you cry for me, my dear
Drowning in a pool of wasted tears
Cause I can't live this nightmare
And I won't live this nightmare
I won't lie
