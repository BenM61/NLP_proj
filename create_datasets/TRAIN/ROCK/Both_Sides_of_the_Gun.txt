Living these days is making me nervous 
Archaic doctrine no longer serve us 
Now we're left as silent witnesses 
We don't know quite what this is 
Other than a war that can't be won 

I feel like I'm crowded, I can't get out 
World keeps on filling me up with doubt 
When you're trapped you got no voice 
Where you're born you got no choice 
Other than to go and take you some 

One dimensional fool 
In a three dimensional world 

Politics, it's a drag 
They put one foot in the grave 
And the other on the flag 
Systems rotten to the core 
Young and old deserve much more 
Than struggling every day until you're done 

Tension 
Too much to mention 
Living on both sides of the gun
