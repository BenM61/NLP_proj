[Lil Mo] 
Ladies I wrote me a manual
How to keep your man
These rules you must follow 
My 10 commandments (oo oo oo)
Let me break it down for you
Rule number 1 
Never give him someone to turn to at night
Rule number 2
Never bring your man around your crew
Rule number 3
Never call him first let him call you
Rule number 4
Never let him know your every move
Rule number 5
Never tell him about your past
How many other lovers you've had
How many other lovers went bad
Make no exceptions
If you want it to last

[Chorus:] 
Girl you got to understand him
If you want to keep your man whipped
Follow my 10 commandments
And he'll keep coming back for more
And more and more 

[Lil Mo] 
Rule number 6
Never mix business with pleasure
Rule number 7
Never move in unless he tell you
Rule number 8
Never tell your friends about your bedroom 
Rule number 9
Never let them know his shoe size
Rule number 10
Should have been rule number 1
'cause If you give in on the first night
Make sure you ride that thing
Scream his name
And he'll be yours for life
'cause you know your excited
(Cos you know your excited)
And you just can't fight it
And you wanna tell all your friends
But you've got to make sure loves intact
Because you want him to keep coming back 

[Chorus: x2] 

There's never no such thing as giving him to much
'cause if you want to wed with your man
You can never give enough
'cause you get excited
And wanna tell everybody
But you've got to make sure
Loves intact
Then it will help you bring him back

[Lil Kim] 
I've been in this thing for years
It made me an animal
Me and my girl
Mo wrote you'll a manual
Step by step booklet for you to keep
Your man in place 
And out the next girls' face
Rule number 1
Never give a dude money
Girl don't be a dummy
Let the homie stay bummy
'cause once he start,
He don't stop, 
That's it
And all he gonna do is spend it on the next chic
Rule number 2 
Before you give him some
It's your way
Shop in a new car
Now that what I call for play
Now don't get me wrong
Respect your man
But if dude gets out of line 
Then check your man
Rule number 3
Should have been rule number 1
Never go down
Till he licks you round
Your neck, your back, your puss and ass crack 
Rule number 4, 5 and 6
Very important lessons
Keep your man guessing
Never let him see you stressing
And if you love here's 7, 8, 9 and 10
Never ever ever mess with his friend
See if you follow these
You'll have mad red to breaka house on the beach
And mad trips to jaca
He'll be home at night cooking you a steaka
And he'll keep coming back for more
On the wake up 

[Chorus: x2] 

Understand If you want to keep your man
And you want to hold on to him
Keep your man whipped
Follow my 10 commandments
Ha
You got it
Ha
Keep coming back for more
Understand
Keep your man
My command
More and more and more
More and more and more
