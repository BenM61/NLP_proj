Got a wife  got a family
Earn my livin' with my hand
I'm a roller in a steel mill
In downtown Birmingham

My daddy was a barber
And a most unsightly man
He was born in Tuscaloosa
But he died right here in Birmingham

[Chorus]
Birmingham  Birmingham
The greatest city in Alabam'
You can travel 'cross this entire land
But there's no place like Birmingham

Got a wife named Mary
But she's called Marie
We live in a three room house
With a pepper tree
And I work all day in the factory
That's alright with me

Got a big black dog
And his name is Dan
Who lives in my backyard in Birmingham
He is the meanest dog in Alabam'
Get 'em Dan

[Chorus]
