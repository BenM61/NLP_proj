Take my clothes, my socks, my shoes away 
I wanna be naked everyday (oh) 
I'de wear nothing but my birthday suite 
Just a chance to be with you 
I'de make loving you a living 
I'de be a chair that you could sit in 

Over and under and through you I go 
Use it, let's do this 
I want you to know 

(CHORUS) 

You run me over in a cadillac dress 
It's got me dancing SOS 
You tear me up 
You turn me in 
You take me under, yeah 

Won't flash your hips and I'm going by 
I think somebody put sex in the wine 
Cause I'm going down 
I'm hangin' in 
I'm headed under, yeah 

Take my car, my house, my time for good 
I wanna live all you like I should (yeah) 
Now girl I wanna be good at you 
Just show me all the things to do 
Use your body as my education 
Take my blackbook as my resignation 
All the things that I could do 
If I could just come talk to you 

Over and under and through you I go 
Use it, let's do this 
I want you to know 

[CHORUS ]

Baby, baby, baby 
Baby, baby, yeah, baby 

[CHORUS x 3]
