I be bustin (bustin) parents be fussin and cussin
Cause all I talk about is silicone and muffins (muffins)
So if you didn't come to hear some strips clubs hits
Then get the hell on cause I'm gettin my mail on; I'm hustlin
I'm talkin about foes and I'm talkin bout fans and kitties
I'm talkin about hoes and I'm talkin bout Kansas City
That's where I dwell wit wit, my my bills
And I I, I will pop hot rocks for real
Venomous, when it gets HOT
The Tech straight killin hatas, when it gets ROCK
The sex rates genemater, so don't miss SHOT
Spits quick game inovator
Chick generator quick trip James Lemonator
This is the beginin of blingin and houses and women
Welcomin angels and demons and cowards are sent it
I'm alive and well but demise will bring ghost stories
When I rise in hell them alive will still vote for me
Watch out, cuzz here comes Tecca Nina
Roll out, cuzz here comes Tecca Nina
Drop down, cuzz here comes Tecca Nina
Cuzz here comes Tecca Nina
Cuzz here comes Tecca Nina
Cuzz here comes Tecca Nina
Bonzai, baby every once I
Smokin and drinkin and poppin so hurry come fly
Cuzz I plenty rolled, and I got plenty dough
And we got plenty hoes, we roll on 24's
What it is, what it was, what it shall be
What the bliz, what the L, where the Belvi
Caroboulu is 151 and Malibu Rum and pineapple
So what's this weakness you tryin to sell me
I represent, the Rougue Dawg villain niggas
Betta repent, the foes all feelin triggas
You got me tempt, we rolls all billa scrilla
Roll call villain killas, froze y'all fill in millas
This be the best time
To bust ya best rhyme
You bring ya best rhyme
I'm on yo next line
And when I flex mine
I see respect signs
Call the request line
And just say TECH N9NE!
They call me Tecca Nina, that be my nick name
I often wreck arenas, most of em chicks man
Spoil us wit checks and visa, that's how we spit game
Havin them bless the weiner, I love to get brain
Four chicks in the back of the truck
Backin it up, suckin on tongues laughin it up
Gased in the cut, bustin the buns slappin it up
Quick wrappin it up, we trust wit no funds
Then passin the butt
Absolute when I shoot the shit
Choose the chicks wit flows that you used to get
Take 'em to Adams house, and rat 'em out
Or take 'em down to Wes' get breastes up in ya face
And scat 'em out
Make room, for the crew and beats that thump
I got the sickness horny chicks mighty mind be
Straight doom, for the crew that see like chumps
I bring 'em six-six triple eight forty-six, ninety nine three
