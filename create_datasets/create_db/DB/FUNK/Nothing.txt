It's late in the evening
And you're breathing with someone else
You come home to call me
And I ask you what you've 
Been doing with yourself
And you say nothing at all
You say nothing at all

You flight is longer that usual
And you conscience ain't no company
I'm there smiling and warm I missed you so
And can't wait to show you how I feel
But you feel nothing at all
You feel nothing at all

There we were
Never strangers before
There was a light that shined on us
But now there's nothing at all

You should've taken a look around
Before you laid that woman down
You better get a hold of yourself
Cause there's a woman here
Who's willing to try

Weeks go by
And you mind seems preoccupied
I feel a piece missing here
But when I ask you about what's going on
You say it's all me my dear
So I thought nothing at all
I thought nothing at all

You should've taken a look around
Before you laid that woman down
You better get a hold of yourself
Cause there's a man in you
About to die
With nothing
With nothing
