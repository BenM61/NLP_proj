If you had this time again
Would you do it all the same?
I wonder, would I?
Of the promises we made
Is there anything you'd change?
In the re-runs of our lives

If I could call you for a day
Just to hear the words you'd say
I would

All the colors that you bring
All come rushing back again
All the places that we've been this time

All the people that you knew
They'll come running back to you
All the faces that we've seen in this life

And we never took the time
To see where we were going
We were only passing by
And we never questioned why
The river keeps on flowing
The beauty of the ride

If I could call you for a day
Just to hear the words you'd say
I would

All the colors that you bring
All come rushing back again
All the places that we've been this time

All the people that you knew
They'll come running back to you
All the faces that we've seen in this life

The river flows

All the colors that you bring
Will they ever come again?
All the places that we've been this time

All the people that you knew
They'll be waiting there for you
All the faces that we've seen in this life

All the colors that you bring
All we ever want to be
All the places that you've dreamed this time

All the people that you knew
They'll come running back to you
All the faces that we've seen in this life
