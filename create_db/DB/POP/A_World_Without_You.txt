I know that you can hear the rhythm of the rain
Although we´re miles apart I know you feel my pain
I try to be so strong, I try to carry on
But since you left the sun don´t seem to shine

My tears are falling on the words you wrote to me
I wish that somehow they could take me where I want to be
It seems so long ago, you held me when I cried
For now I just pretend you´re by my side, oh-oh yeah

Everything that I touch turns to blue 
When I´m living in a world without you
I´m going crazy baby, I am missing you
Can´t imagine all I go through
When I´m living in a world without you
I´m not alone I know that you can feel it too

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I try to watch a movie but you´re all that I can see (all that I can see)
And, in my dreams I know I always see you constantly
But then a dream comes to an end and I´m alone
And I can´t seem to let this feeling go, whoa-oh baby

Everything that I touch turns to blue 
When I´m living in a world without you
I´m going crazy baby, I am missing you
Can´t imagine all I go through
When I´m living in a world without you(can´t live without you)
I´m not alone I know that you can feel it too

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la (la la la la)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la (la la la la)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

I try to be so strong, I try to carry on
But since you left the sun don´t seem to shine, whoa-oh-ooh

Everything that I touch turns to blue 
When I´m living in a world without you(I´m going crazy, missing you baby)
I´m going crazy baby, I am missing you
Can´t imagine all I go through
When I´m living in a world without you (a world without you)
I´m not alone I know that you can feel it too

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la (what can I do without you baby)
Can´t imagine all I go through
When I´m living in a world without you (living without you)
I´m not alone I know that you can feel it too

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la (la la la la)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la (la la la la)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

I´m going crazy missing you baby
Living without you (living without you)
