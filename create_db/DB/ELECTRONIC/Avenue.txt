Ooh, young heart
Ooh, young heart
Ooh, young heart

Pass me the suitcase, baby
I know it's not that easy
And give me my mirror, love
First give me back my memories

And oh, oh, how many years
Is it now Maurice?

Ooh, young heart
Ooh, young heart
Ooh, young heart
And, ooh, oh the clown's no good

And I was half-asleep
And riding on a slow-coach
I think I lose all these things
Still, meaning I'm not holy

And, oh, oh, your honey-dish
Oh, it's on my list

Ooh, young heart
Ooh, young heart
Ooh, young heart
And, ooh, oh the clown's no good

Wish my heart's wish climbing out your window
For your savage amusement
You put a spell over me, well
Smells like lemon flavor

Tuesday, if I had you back again
You know I'm against the future
Wednesday, I was a little girl
I was the little girl who'd like to snog your face

And ooh, oh, how many years
Is it now Maurice?

Ooh, young heart
Ooh, young heart
Ooh, young heart
And, ooh, oh the clown's no good

Ooh, young heart
Ooh, young heart
Ooh, young heart
Ooh, young heart
Ooh, young heart
Ooh, young heart
And, ooh, oh the clown's no good

And, ooh, oh the clown's no good
And, ooh, oh the clown's no good
And, ooh, oh the clown's no good
And, ooh, oh the clown's no good
And, ooh, oh the clown's no good
And then I shall take back to Maurice
And, ooh, oh the clown's no good
