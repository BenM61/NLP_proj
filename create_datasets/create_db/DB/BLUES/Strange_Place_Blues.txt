I'm a stranger at this place and I'm lookin' for my mother's grave
I'm a stranger at this place and I'm lookin' for my mother's grave 
Well it seems like to me, ooh well, well some of us goin' to wail

I was at mother's grave, when they put my mother away 
I was at mother's grave, when they put my mother away 
And I can't find no one ooh, well, to take her place

After my mother was put away, I thought my wife would take her place
After my mother was put away, I thought my wife would take her place
I'll show you the diff'rence 'tween a mother and a wife, well, my wife done throw me away

I wished I could find someone to take my mother's place
I wished I could find someone to take my mother's place
And if I can't find no one, ooh well, well you'll find me at her grave

I'm standin' on my mother's grave and I wished I could seen her face
I'm standin' on my mother's grave and I wished I could seen her face
I'll be glad when that day comes, ooh well, well when it be to dive me away
