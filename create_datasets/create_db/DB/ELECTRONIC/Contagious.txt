Contagious
Spreadin' like a fire, baby
Contagious
I'm 'bout to lose control

Contagious
'Cause you're my sweet desire, baby
Contagious
I just can't let you go

When I see you
Every time we meet in my knees I get weak
I always lose control
'Cause you're so fine, baby, you're so cold

Give me fever
Temperature's rising, girl, what am I supposed to do
Can't go to a doctor, baby
'Cause there is only one cure and it's you

Your love's contagious
Spreadin' like a fire, baby
Contagious
I'm 'bout to lose control

Contagious
'Cause you're my sweet desire, baby
Contagious
I just can't let you go

You're my prescription
I need your lovin' every hour, 24 times a day
Don't give me such a hard time, baby
I'm so in love, I just can't stay away

Every time we touch I feel somethin' new
Hooked on your love and I don't know what to do
Love has the power, you've got the upper hand
I'll give you what you want and your wish is my command
