I'm out, I'm out in bushes
Playing, playing with plastics
Birdbrain, they say I'm a birdbrain
If I am then can I just fly away
Shoe straps and eyelashes washing my brain
Twenty-five years are just washed down the drain
They are, they are a drunken bird
Flying, into the windows
Birdbrain, they say I'm a birdbrain
If I am then can I just fly away
Shoe straps and eyelashes washing my brain
Twenty-five years are just washed down the drain
Shoe straps and eyelashes washing my brain
Twenty-five years are just washed down the drain
If I am then can I just fly away
