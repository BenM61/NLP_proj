Don't want my mammy
I don't need a friend
My heart is broken, it won't ever mend
I ain't much carin' 
Just where I will end
I must have that man

I'm like an oven
That's cryin' for heat
He treats me awful
Each time we meet
It's just unlawful
How that boy can cheat
But I must have that man

He's hot as Hades
A lady's not safe in his arms when she's kissed
But I'm afraid that when he's cooled off
And maybe I'm ruled off his list
I'll never be missed
I need that person much worse 'n just bad
I'm half alive 'n he's drivin' me mad
He's only human if he's to be had
I must have that man

I must have that man
