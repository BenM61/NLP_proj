Oh ah oh ah yay! 
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh, yeah ay yeah ay! 

They can't keep a good man down 
Always keep a smile when they want me to frown
Keep the vibes and they stood my grounds 
They will never ever take my crown
Who Jah bless I say no man curse 
Things gettin' better when they thought it would be worst
Here comes the officers askin for a search, they found no weopen just only a draw first

'Cause I'm so solid as a rock they just can't stop me now
Even when they set their traps they just can't stop me now
People will say this and that they just can't stop me now
Even when they set up road blocks they just can't stop me now

When they come with they evilest thoughts I just listen whenever they talk
Jah is the light into my dark, he cut and tear on my path
They fight without a cause tryin to make my life so hard
The king of kings and the lord of lords, give it all rewards

I'm so solid as a rock they just can't stop me now
Even when they set their traps they just can't stop me now
People will say this and that they just can't stop me now
Even when they set up road blocks they just can't stop me now

So don't you mix me up with your dirty games, your only tryin to tarnish my name
Your only lookin for the innocent to blame, when your the ones who issue the guns down the lane
You only cause dysfunction and frame, but the right ones believe in the reign
Love is all I got to give and I'm not ashamed, lookin towards the future this lie can't tame

'Cause I'm so solid as a rock they just can't stop me now
Even when they set their traps they just can't stop me now
People will say this and that they just can't stop me now
Even when they set up road blocks they just can't stop me now
