I try but I can't seem to get myself to think of
Anything but you
Your breath on my face, your warm gentle kiss
I taste the truth, I taste the truth
You know what I came here for, so I won't ask for more

I wanna be with you, if only for a night
To be the one who's in your arms, who holds you tight
I wanna be with you there's nothing more to say
There's nothing else I want more than to feel this way

I wanna be with you

So I'll hold you tonight like I would if you were mine
To hold forever more
And I'll savor each touch that I wanted so much
To feel before, to feel before
How beautiful it is just to be like this

I wanna be with you, if only for a night
To be the one who's in your arms, who holds you tight
I wanna be with you there's nothing more to say
There's nothing else I want more than to feel this way

I wanna be with you
(I wanna be with you)
I wanna be with you

Oh, baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore
It drives me crazy when I try to
So call my name, take my hand
Can you make my wish, baby, your command

I wanna be with you there's nothing more to say
There's nothing else I want more than to feel this way

I wanna be with you
(I wanna be with you)
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, yeah
(I wanna be with you)

I wanna be, I wanna be with you
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be
I wanna be with you
I wanna be baby, I wanna be with you
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be
(I wanna be with you)

I wanna be baby, I wanna be with you
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you, I wanna be
(I wanna be with you)
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
