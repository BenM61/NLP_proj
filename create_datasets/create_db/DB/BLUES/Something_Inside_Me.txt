Something inside me that just won't let me be
Something inside me that just won't let me be, yeah
My baby is gone and left me and my heart's in misery

I wake up early in the mornin' in my bedroom all alone
I wake up early in the mornin' in my bedroom all alone
I don't find my baby and I wonder, I wonder
Where she gone oh yeah, yeah

My baby's gone and I'm so tired, it's a cryin' shame
Yes, you know I'm so tired, it's a cryin' shame
Ever since she been gone, you know my life don't feel the same
