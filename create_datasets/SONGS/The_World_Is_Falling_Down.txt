There are some folks 
I used to know 
Who used to smile 
And say hello, 
And spin the world 
And turn the page 
Entertaining 
From the stage 

Father time 
Forever true 
Loves its own 
And me and you 
Disappear just like the sun, 
When the day is done. 

The world is falling down, 
hold my hand 
It's a lonely sound, 
hold my hand 
We'll follow the breeze 
And go like the wind 
And look for a place 
Where the willows bend 
The world is falling down, 
Hold my hand, hold my hand, 
Hold my hand, hold my hand 

Summer's gone 
And winter's here 
We had a lot of rain this year 
The news is really very sad 
The time is late, 
The fruit is bad 
The morning's come 
And roosters crow 
But people have no place to go 
And disappear 
Just like the sun 
When the day is done 

The world is falling down 
Hold my hand 
It's a lonely sound 
Hold my hand 
We'll follow the sund 
And live for the day 
And look for a place 
Where the children play 
The world is falling down 
Hold my hand, 
Hold my hand 
Hold my hand 
Hold my hand
