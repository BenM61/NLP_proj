Hey, baby, why you goin' that way
Oh, sugar, come on go it my way
And I'm goin' to a place where funky people play
Oh, honey, we'll sing sho'nuff dance the night away

Girl, you got that sexy smile
You move, it's driving me wild
Girl, I kinda kinda like your style
For you I'd walk a country mile

Shake and dance with me (Ooh, baby)
Every night and day (Yeah, hey, hey, hey)
Shake and dance with me
Where funky people play

Oh, sugar, you got honey drippin' off the walls
We might be trippin', skinny-dippin', makin' love in the halls
Oh, honey, your mind'll never be the same
No, darlin', you don't have to be ashamed

Groovin' is the game we play
Girl, we'll dance the night away
They'll be comin' day by day
You'll always hear the people say, say, say, say

Shake and dance with me (Ooh, oh, ooh, ooh, yeah, well)
Every night and day
Shake and dance with me
Where funky people play (Ah, play it again Sam)

One more time

Shake and dance with me (Ooh, oh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Every night and day (Yeah, well)
Shake and dance with me
Where funky people play

Shake and dance with me (Girl, shake your body, well, well)
Every night and day (Go on, baby)
Shake and dance with me
Where funky people play

Shake and dance with me
Every night and day
