Oh, oh
For you (for you)

I had a change of heart
Don't know where to start
What I'm about to say may surprise you
Now I see it clear
Life ain't always fair, oh
What can you do?
When you don't want to hurt him
'Cause you don't deserve him
And there's no other way
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm breaking down
I just can't take it anymore
Oh no, I won't let you go
You know I'm coming for you
No matter what it's gonna take
I gotta make this move
You're the one that I choose
You know I'm coming for you
And I just can't go another day
Without you next to me, oh oh, yeah

Don't know what to say
Guess I'll take the blame
Eventually it was bound to happen
I know you played your part
I ain't tryin' to make it hard
But it's the right thing to do
And you don't want to hurt him
'Cause you don't deserve him
There's no other way
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah

I'm breaking down
I just can't take it anymore
Oh no, I won't let you go
You know I'm coming for you
No matter what it's gonna take
I gotta make this move
You're the one that I choose
You know I'm coming for you
And I just can't go another day
Without you next to me, oh oh, yeah

Now that you know the truth
Just wanna be with you
Can't go back; this is real
'Cause what we share
It's undeniable
Don't want to hide no more
Here I am, and I'm coming for you, oh!

I'm breaking down
I just can't take it anymore
Oh no, I won't let you go
You know I'm coming for you
No matter what it's gonna take
I gotta make this move
You're the one that I choose
You know I'm coming for you
And I just can't go another day
Without you next to me, oh oh, yeah

I'm breaking down
I just can't take it anymore
Oh no, I won't let you go
You know I'm coming for you

For you, for you
