Come on, you can do it
Come on, you can do it

Hello I'm leaving my demon
Hello I'm saying goodbye to him 
Bye, bye old friend 
And if my life was built on dreaming
Then I was but a fool

Today, the sun will set in east 
Hell will catch a cold 
And I'm down here on my knees 
Come on and take me home 
As you love me, baby trust this
On a day like this, fools like me can change 

Hello I'm leaving my reasons 
Hello they never were good to me 
Bye, bye old friends 
I kept on guessing my own feelings 
And I was but a fool 

Today, the sun will set in east 
Hell will catch a cold 
And I'm down here on my knees 
Come on and take me home 
As you love me, baby trust this 
On a day like this, fools like me can change 

And You have trusting eyes like me my love
Though you've seen a million things 
We travel different roads 
But we are still the same 
We are still the same
