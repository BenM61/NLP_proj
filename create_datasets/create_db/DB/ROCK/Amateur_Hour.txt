Lawns grow plush in the hinter lands
Its the perfect little setting for the one night stands
The drapes are drawn and the lights are low
Its the time to put in practice what you've dreamed about

But she can show you what you must do to be more like people better than you.

Amateur Hour goes on and on 
When you turn pro, you know,
She lets you know
Amateur Hour goes on and on
When you turn pro, you know,
She tells you so

Girls grow tops to go topless in
While we sit and count the hairs 
That blossom from our chin
Our voices change at a rapid pace
I could start a song at tenor and then end at bass

So choose your partners everyone
If you hesitate, the good ones are gone

Amateur Hour goes on and on 
When you turn pro, you know,
She lets you know
Amateur Hour goes on and on
When you turn pro, you know,
She tells you so

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oooh ooh ooh

And Amateur Hour goes on and on,
When you turn pro you know,
She lets you know

Dance, laugh, wine, dine, talk and sing
But those cannot replace what is the real thing
It's a lot like playing the violin
You cannot start off to be Yehudi Menuhin

So Amateur Hour goes on and on 
When you turn pro, you know,
She lets you know
Amateur Hour goes on and on
When you turn pro, you know,
She tells you so
