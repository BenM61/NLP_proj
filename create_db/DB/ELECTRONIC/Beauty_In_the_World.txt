I know you're fed up
But life don't let up for us
All they talk about is what is going down?
What's been messed up for us?
When I look around I see blue skies
I see butterflies for us

Listen to the sound and lose it
Its sweet music and dance with me
'Cause there is beauty in the world
So much beauty in the world
Always beauty in the world
So much beauty in the world
Shake your booty boys and girls for the beauty in the world
Pick your diamond pick your pearl there is beauty in the world
All together now

We need more lovin'
We need more money, they say
Change is gonna come
Like the weather
They say forever
They say
Well baby in between
Notice the blue skies
Notice the butterflies
Notice me

Stop and smell the flowers
And lose it in sweet music and dance with me
'Cause there is beauty in the world
So much beauty in the world
Always beauty in the world
There is beauty in the world
Shake your booty boys and girls for the beauty in the world
Pick your diamond pick your pearl there is beauty in the world
All together now

Heya, throw your hands up and holla
Heya, throw your hands up and holla
When you don't know what to do
Don't know if you'll make it through
Remember god is giving you beauty in the world
