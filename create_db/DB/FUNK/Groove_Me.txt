When I get you home tonight
It is gonna be alright
Girl, just do it now
And let's just take it nice and slow
Hey, girl, I know
Girl I'm in a romantic mood and sing too
Won't you groove me?
Groove Me Tonight (sing along with me)
Groove Me baby

Even if it's only for awhile
Enjoy this good loving with a smile
Do it wild tonight
Having a heart attack tonight
We'll go wild tonight
Baby, baby I can be the one that does you right
And you can Groove Me, baby tonight!
Groove Me baby 

Don't leave me with your prayers girl
Tell me you are on my world
Girl you know, girl don't let me be baby
I need your loving 
If only you, my love, can Groove Me baby
Groove Me baby

Groove Me baby
Tonight tonight right now baby
That's what I want you to do
I want you to Groove Me tonight
Don't say no don't say maybe
Groove Me baby now! Yeah

Hold up! Hold up! It ain't over!
I thought y'all didn't like the beat?
It's not over! The party's not over!

Funky

Hold up! Hold up! It ain't over!
I thought y'all didn't like the beat?
It's not over!
