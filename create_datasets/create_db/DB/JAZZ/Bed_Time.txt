Sleep, baby, sleep 
Your father tends the sheep 
Your mother shakes the dreamland tree 
And from it fall sweet dreams for thee 
Sleep, baby, sleep 
Sleep, baby, sleep 

Sleep, baby, sleep 
Our cottage vale is deep 
The little lamb is on the green 
With snowy fleece so soft and clean 
Sleep, baby, sleep 
Sleep, baby, sleep
