(Tomorrow) You will love again
(Tomorrow) Your tear-filled eyes will dry
Tomorrow (tomorrow) he'll come to you and then
You will forget I made you cry

(Tomorrow) Your broken heart will mend
(Tomorrow) He'll kiss your tears goodbye
Tomorrow (tomorrow) he'll take you by the hand
And you will forget I made you cry

I know I'm leaving you with a broken heart
But time will heal the wounds; you'll make a brand-new start
(Tomorrow) You'll wake up with the sun
(Tomorrow) You'll see a brand-new sky
Tomorrow (tomorrow) he'll hold you in his arms
And you will forget I made you cry
(Tomorrow)
