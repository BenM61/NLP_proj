Doin' too much, too much, 7 much, too much
Don't you know that I'm the one
You can't get nothin' over on me, baby

Doin' too much, too much, way too much, too much
You doin' too much, I'm the one

I see you over there peepin' a player out from hella far away
Tryin' to get with some of this here mackin'
Apparently you ain't tryin' hard enough 'cause if you was
You woulda been made your way over here to the V.I.P. with us

Where yo' man at? What's the matter with that clown
Leavin' a sharp-ass lil' broad like you up in here with all us players?
Hopefully you up in here with some of yo' friends, so some of my friends
Can get with some of yo' friends and turn it into somethin'

I'm fin' to walk over here to the bar and get the bartender
To mix me one of my customized drinks without the blender
Get everybody up in the club up in here off the numb-numb juice
Vodka, 7-Up, and Cran-apple juice

The ladies outnumber the fellas six-to-one
And me and my fellas up in here like good one pimp, we all won
The pretty one's in here are hot like a dog in heat
Touchin' they toes, backin' it up, and dancin' like a freak

Doin' too much, too much, 7 much, too much
Don't you know that I'm the one
You can't get nothin' over on me, baby

Doin' too much, too much, way too much, too much
You doin' too much, I'm the one

Man, I'm over here on super-purp'
Up in the club hollerin' at somebody else's work
Yeah, pimpin', I'm up on all the slang that you make up
But I believe you stay about your marbles and be about your bacon

Youse a player about yours and I'm sensin' and smellin'
That youse one of them sharp-ass lil' sisters, huh?
Might even want you to be my baby, maybe ma
Speakin' upon my baby ma, here she comes

And she hoodrat, hoodrat, hoochie momma
Same ol', same ol', dry-ass drama
Comin' up in my face about the, child support
Talkin' about, takin' me to court

Takin' me to court, can't work me
Most of these hoes be mo' full of shit
Than a Christmas turkey

Doin' too much, too much, 7 much, too much
Don't you know that I'm the one
You can't get nothin' over on me, baby

Doin' too much, too much, way too much, too much
You doin' too much, I'm the one

Well alright ho', boss mo', player hater hater my noggin'
D-Boy, people swear up and down I'm a rocker
But I'm a soil block turf hog built for battle
15's in the trunk, like a snake they rattle

Leave skid marks all on the gravel
Drivin' like a bat outta hell to the hotel
Bounce roll rock skate side to side
Baby got the gin and the Astroglade

I hopin' that the jimmy don't bust
While I thrust much cush gush knock boots with lust
Swish swush, loose nuts, drop juice drip stuff
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 much

Doin' too much, too much, 7 much, too much
Don't you know that I'm the one
You can't get nothin' over on me, baby

Doin' too much, too much, way too much, too much
You doin' too much, I'm the one

Baby, baby, baby, baby, you doin' too much
And all the fellas say
And all the ladies say
And all the fellas say
And all the ladies say
And all the fellas say
And all the ladies say
