Raise you banners raise them high in your homeland hear the cry
From the battle turn home back to England to claim your throne
Six white horses you must ride loyal comrades by your side
Prince of lions the second son through the darkness the king will come

Lion, Lionheart
Defender of the faith
Lion, Lionheart
Protector of the state
Lionheart

You crown awaits you the chosen one tell the people that freedom's come
Light the beacons ring the bells sing you minstrels there's tales to tell
Send the message across the land the king returns with sword in hand
Law and order he will restore evil tyranny will reign no more

Lion, Lionheart
Defender of the faith
Lion, Lionheart
Protector of the state
Lionheart

Raise your banners raise them high in your homeland hear the cry
From the battle turn to home back to England to claim your throne
Build your castles guard the keep behind these walls the city sleeps
No more conflict the blood is shed three gold lions on flags of red

Lion, Lionheart
Defender of the faith
Lion, Lionheart
Protector of the state
Lionheart
