Last night I got a message from you
You told me that my head had gone blue
Last night I got a message from you
You showed me what I needed to do

You're cool, I'm hot, you're girl, I'm not
You're bad, bad news, so get on
Hey, hey, hey, yeah

Last night I got a message from you
You told me something I never knew
Last night I got a message from you
You pulled me from the hospital too

You're cool, I'm hot, you're girl, I'm not
You're bad, bad news, so get on

Rip out your heart and give it to me
Rip out your heart and give it to me
Rip out your heart and give it to me
Rip out your heart and give it to me
Give it to me

Last night I got a message from you
You told me that my head had gone blue
Last night I got a message from you
You showed me what I needed to do

You're cool, I'm hot, you're girl, I'm not
You're bad, bad news, so get on
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
