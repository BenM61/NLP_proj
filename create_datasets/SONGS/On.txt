I am on
Switched on
A sudden clearness
And clarity

Hidden away
In every locked toilet
I've been waiting for you
In the Joiners' arms

I know your name
I know your name
I've danced with you
We're all friends here

Silver slugs
Lined up like bullets
Rolled up twenties
They disappear

You make my tongue loose
You make my tongue loose
I am hopeful and stutter-free

You make my tongue loose
You make my tongue loose
I am home free

On Friday night
I do all the talking
A pint and a fight
The dance floor is mine

Truth serum
And limbs that won't listen
Drunken "I Love You"s
On top of the world

And when it runs out
We're chasing something we'll never catch
And when it runs out
We buy more

A flatness so bleak
I've been bitten by a vampire
A flatness bleaker of the one it replaced

You make my tongue loose
You make my tongue loose
I am hopeful and stutter-free

You make my tongue loose
You make my tongue loose
I am home free

I can charm
I can charm them all
I can charm
Them all

I can charm
I can charm them all
I can charm
Them all

You make my tongue loose
You make my tongue loose
I am hopeful and stutter-free

You make my tongue loose
You make my tongue loose
I am home free

I can charm
I can charm them all
I can charm
Them all

I can charm
I can charm them all
I can charm
Them all
