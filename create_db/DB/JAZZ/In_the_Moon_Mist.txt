One night I wandered by a stream
And you were standing in the moon mist
I thought at first you were a dream
Until you smiled there in the moon mist
The first faint flush of love was
On your stylish face
And in the hush of love
We met in one embrace
Now till we meet again I'll treasure
That moment when we kissed in the moon mist
