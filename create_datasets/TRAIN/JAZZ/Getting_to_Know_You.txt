Getting to know you, getting to know all about you.
Getting to like you, getting to hope you like me. 
Getting to know you, putting it my way, 
But nicely, 
You are precisely, 
My cup of tea.

Getting to know you, 
Getting to feel free and easy
When I am with you, 
Getting to know what to say 
Haven't you noticed 
Suddenly I'm bright and breezy 
Because of all the beautiful and new 
Things I'm learning about you 
Day by day.

Sharing your spirit, 
Sharing your tears and your laughter 
Hoping it goes on, 
Hoping it lasts endlessly 
Getting to know you, putting it my way, 
But sweetly, 
You are completely, 
My friend you see.

Telling you my dreams, 
Getting to feel that you're with me
Making our own fun, 
Knowing we know how to play
Now that I've met you
Suddenly I'm mostly happy
I've found a new pal, beautiful and true
Yes I'm talking about you
Friends today
