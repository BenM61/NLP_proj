Hello boy its been awhile
Guess you'll be glad to know 
That I've learned how to laugh and smile
Getting over you was slow
They say old lovers can be good friends
But i never thought I'd really see you
I'd really see you again

I go crazy
When I look in your eyes
I still go crazy
No my heart just can't hide 
That feeling inside
Way deep down inside
Oh baby you know 
When I look in your eyes
I go crazy

You say she satisfies your mind
Tells you all of her dreams
I know much that means to you
I realize that i was blind
Just when i thought i was over you
I see your face and it just ain't true 
no it just ain't true

I go crazy
When I look in your eyes
I still go crazy
That old flame comes alive
It's starts burning inside
Way deep down inside
Oh baby
You know when I look in your eyes
I go crazy

I go crazy
You know when I look in your eyes
I go crazy
No my heart just can't hide
That old feelin' inside
Way deep down inside
I go crazy
You know when I look in your eyes
I go crazy

Crazy
