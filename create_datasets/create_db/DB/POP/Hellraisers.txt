Watch out!

Have you heard the word on the street today
We're packin' out, it ain't your way, your way
Roll out the carpet, and kneel onto the ground
Shut off the party 'cos we're coming 'round

Step into the fire, we're here to stray for you
We're taking you higher, that's what we're paid to do

Hell raisers, from town to town, hell raisers never let you down
Hell raisers, steppin' out, hell raisers, let there be no doubt (no)

New York to London, Paris to L.A.
Rollin' thunder, 'cause storm is on the way - get ready
Pressure risin' as the last's goin' down
Pretty seats, we've come to rock this town

Step into the fire, we're here to stray for you
We're taking you higher, that's what we're paid to do

Hell raisers, from town to town, hell raisers never let you down
Hell raisers, steppin' out, hell raisers, let there be no doubt (no)

Have you heard the word on the street today
We're packin' out, it ain't your way

Hell raisers, from town to town, hell raisers never let you down
Hell raisers, let there be no doubt
