Oh oh, yeah yeah yeah

Money in my pocket but I just can't get no love
Money in my pocket but I just can't get no love
I'm praying for a girl to be my own

Soon you said she coming but I don't believe a word she say
'Cause she ran away and then left me one rainy day
She made me have in mind that her love would never die
And now I'm alone, so alone, so alone, yeah, yeah

Money in my pocket but I just can't get no love
Money in my pocket but I just can't get no love
Money in my pocket but I just can't get no love
Money in my pocket but I just can't get no love

The love I had in mind was very, very hard to find
It's hard for a man to live without a woman, yeah
And a woman need a man to cling to
You'll see what love can do after making me feel blue

Ain't that a shame, whoa, baby?
Ain't that a shame to make me feel blue?

Money in my pocket but I just can't get no love
Money in my pocket but I just can't get no love
Money in my pocket but I just can't get no love
Money in my pocket but I just can't get no love

Money in my pocket but I just can't get no love
Money in my pocket but I just can't get no love
Money in my pocket but I just can't get no love
Money in my pocket but I just can't get no love
