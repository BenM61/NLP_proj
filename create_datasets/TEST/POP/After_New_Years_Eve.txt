Everybody's somebody's fool
What used to be ??????

As you live, you learn
Though it may burn (?????)
Everybody's somebody's fool

You know you like
Making fools out of others
Pretending you're just giving them love
But remember
Sisters or brothers
You've got to answer
To the one up above

It's beautiful
To watch love begin
But oh how sad
When it ends
As you go through life
Remember this rule
Everybody's somebody's fool

Mary Shelly (???)

Merci beaucoup
I love you so, my darling
And if by chance
We should happen to part
It would be, oh my God
Like a thorn
Through my aching heart

It's beautiful
To watch love begin
But oh how sad
When it ends
As you go through life
Remember this rule
Everybody's somebody's fool
