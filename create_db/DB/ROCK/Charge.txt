I am electric with a bottle in me
Got a bottle in me
And glory be, these fuckers are ignoring me
I'm from another century

I am a preacher when I've got it on me
And I've got it on me
And glory be these fuckers are ignoring me
We never learn from history

Hey, I am the boy who loved her so in every song
And I design that little mystery on your tongue
I've broken jaws protecting laws to keep you free
I've made your day so take a seat by me

I am an old tree, gonna' talk my jaw free
Someone come and get me
Another night beside myself would finish me
Give us G&T and sympathy

I am the die hard with an empty dance card propping up a young bar
I'm pouring oil in double time upon the troubled rising tide inside of me
Upon my history

Hey, I am the boy who loved her so in every song
And I design that little mystery on your tongue
I've broken jaws protecting laws to keep you free
I've made your day so take a seat by me

Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey

Hey, I am the boy who loved her so in every song
And I design that little mystery on your tongue
I've broken jaws protecting laws to keep you free
I've made your day so take a seat by me
