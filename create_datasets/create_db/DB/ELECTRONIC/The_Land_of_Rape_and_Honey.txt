Face to face, blood to blood
The mountain, you tumbled from
And in the land of rape and honey, you prey

Step by step
You climb the mountain, you prey

Fist to fist, eye to eye
The rulers of the wasteland
And in the land of rape and honey you prey

Step by step
You climb the mountain you prey

Head to head, chest to chest
Which country is the very best?
And in the land of rape and honey
You prey

Step by step
You climb the mountain, you prey
