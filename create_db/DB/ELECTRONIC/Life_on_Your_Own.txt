Winter is approaching;
There's snow upon the ground.
It's good of you to visit me;
I'm glad you came around.
I don't know how you found me;
I didn't let you know.
I only moved to this address
About a week ago.
I guess you think I ran out,
But that's not true.
Other people settle down;
I never do.
I always have to move on;
Just have to go.
I've often wondered why that is.
I'd like to say, but I just don't know.
I guess you always wanted
Life on your own.
I guess you always wanted
Life on your own.
Up here, the summer's shorter,
And winter's very cold.
I'm looking forward to the peace
My lonely life will hold.
I'm really glad you came here.
Thank you for the talk.
It's funny how my problem stopped
When we went for a walk.
Standing here together
Means so much.
I won't forget your confidence.
I won't forget your touch.
You know I'll come to see you
Passing through.
We'll always be a world apart.
I'll travel on, but I will be true.
I guess you always wanted
Life on your own.
I guess you always wanted
Life on your own.
I guess you always wanted
Life on your own.
I guess you always wanted
Life on your own.
