Extracted for centuries
Viles of blood
They have seized
For their purpose
A malicious crime
Plotted since the
Dawn of time

Why the reason for my pain
It's not my fault
Must have been made to go insane
Living in this Hell
I don't know why
I don't give up
I must die

Boiled in blood
Adrenalin pumping through my veins
No sane thoughts remain
Mind is being ripped and torn
How much more can I endure
Adrenalin pumping through my veins
No sane thoughts remain

Happiness is now devoured
Hatred leaves my brain, scared
Emotions ripping through my head
I'd often wished I was dead
Growing feelings despair

Now the hunt begins to flare
Psychotic intentions rip through my mind
Causing pain is so divine
Now I'm their prey, my blood they spill
Now It's time I think I kill
