We fall right in and suffer the sins
Try to pull things round when the air starts to thin
We nurse regrets, restricted in our own belief
A new disease

We shake new hands, the victims of fate
We tread new ground misfortune conveys
You tear yourself apart
Wishing to be born again
A different man

Comfort in sound
It's all around
Ease back the strain
Come heal your pain
Comfort in sound
Its all around you now
Comfort in sound

We suffer love together as one
An empty heart with nowhere to turn
We find ourselves looking back another way
A brand new day

Comfort in sound
Its all around
Ease back the strain
Come heal your pain
Comfort in sound
Its all around you now, yeah

Solution gone, emotions ablaze
A life so strong just faded away
You find yourself searching for a quick release
A new belief

Comfort in sound
Its all around
Ease back the strain
Come heal your pain
Comfort in sound
Its all around you now
Comfort in sound
