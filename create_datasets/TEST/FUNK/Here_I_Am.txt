Honey I know, I know what's on your mind
You think that I just want to have a real good time
But look a little closer baby, you never know what you might find
The things I'll do for you girl will blow your mind
And if you're ready here I am, willing and able
Tell you no lies, I'll lay my cards on the table
This could be what we've both been waiting for
So take my hand you don't have to look no more

If you want a heart that's true
Someone who will see you through
Here I am I belong to you
Baby I know you won't regret
Baby for you I'll do my best
Here I am I belong to you

Oh love never comes easy, a game of give and take
Sometimes your heart may break 
But in the end it all will work out 
Just put your trust in me, never doubt

If you want a heart that's true
Someone who will see you through
Here I am I belong to you
Baby I know you won't regret
Baby for you I'll do my best
Here I am I belong to you
