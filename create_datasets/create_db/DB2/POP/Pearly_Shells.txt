Pearly shells from the ocean
Shining in the sun
Covering the shore
When I see them
My heart tells me that I love you
More than all the little pearly shells

For every grain of sand upon the beach
I've got a kiss for you
And I've got more left over 
For each star that twinkles in the blue

Pearly shells
Shining in the sun
Covering the shore
When I see them
My heart tells me that I love you
More than all the little pearly shells

Pupu a o Ewa
I ka nuku
E lawe mai
Ahe aina
Mai no
Ala hula puuloa he ala hele no kaahupahau

I apau huna one i ka kahakai
Ua honi nau
Ho'i koe lawa na
Pakahi hoku 'i ka lani
Puhau
Ala hula puuloahe ala hele no kaahupahau
