Looking over all the angles obvious that some ain't right
Litter the recycle bin with all the things I'll change tonight
Well that's not wrong, it's merely lame
There's no need to hide my shame
Well I'm tired of slowly sinking
Still there's no one else to blame

I can't help it I'm a quitter
From inside I'm cold and bitter
Always out an unbeliever
We're not floating in the ether

Sick of the illusion that it's sad to ever want to know
Taking off and sputtering whenever it was time to go

Well it's not my fault, I'll never try
I can't even tell you why
Well I thought I heard you calling
From the corner of my eye

I can't help it I'm a quitter
From inside I'm cold and bitter
Always out and in denial
Laying wreaths and spanish tile
I'm not scared I'm only nervous
When chocolate shakes and power surges
Stephen hawking can't know either
We're not floating in the ether

It's not my fault, I'll never try
Well I can't even tell you why
Well I thought I heard you calling
From the corner of my eye

I can't help it I'm a quitter
From inside I'm cold and bitter
Always out and in denial
Laying wreaths and spanish tile
I'm not scared I'm only nervous
When chocolate shakes and power surges
Stephen hawking can't know either
We're not floating in the ether

Always out and in denial
Laying wreaths and spanish tile
Stephen hawking can't know either
We're not floating in the ether...
