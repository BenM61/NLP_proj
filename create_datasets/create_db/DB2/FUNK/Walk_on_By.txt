If you see me walking down the street
And I start to cry each time we meet
Walk on by, walk on by

Make believe
That you don't see the tears
Sure just let me grieve in private
'Cause each time I see you,
I just can't help myself I think about how tight we used to be
I break down and cry, oh baby
Walk on by

I just can't get over losing you
So if I seem broken in two
Please walk on by, walk on by
Foolish pride
That's all that I have left
So let me hide
The tears and the sadness you gave me
You put the hurt on me, you socked it to me mama
When you said goodbye
So please walk on by
Make believe you never see the tears I cry
So do me a favor and walk by
So I'm beggin' ya to walk on by, oh yeah
Make believe you never see the tears I cry
So I'm beggin' ya, I'm beggin' ya to walk on by
Make believe you never see the tears I cry
Oh there's no dust in my eye, oh no
Smoke ain't makin' me cry, no no no
It's the hurt you put on me, yeah
I don't wantcha to see this man cry
So please walk on by, ah no no walk on by, walk on by
