Ay, boy, whatcha say, boy?
You tryna play coy like a Gameboy?
Hit my phone boy, is you home boy?
Are you alone boy? Come give me dome, boy
Got a boy with degrees, a boy in the streets
A boy on his knees, he a man in the sheets
Sheesh, it's all Greek to me
Got this boy speaking Spanish, ay Papi

Baby, I don't need you
I just wanna freak you
I heard you a freak, too
What's 2 plus 2? (4, 3, 2, ow)

Boys, boys, boys
Make a girl go crazy (4, 3, 2, ow)
Boys, boys, boys
Make a girl go crazy (4, 3, 2, ow)

I like big boys, itty bitty boys
Mississippi boys, inner city boys
I like the pretty boys with the bow tie
Get your nails did, let it blow dry
I like a big beard, I like a clean face
I don't discriminate, come and get a taste
From the playboys to the gay boys
Go and slay, boys, you my fave boys

Baby, I don't need you (I don't need)
I just wanna freak you (want, I want it bad)
I heard you a freak, too (that's right)
What's 2 plus 2? (4, 3, 2, ow)

Boys, boys, boys
Make a girl go crazy (4, 3, 2, ow)
Boys, boys, boys
Make a girl go crazy (4, 3, 2, ow)

4, 3, 2, ow (Woo)
Boys, boys, boys
Make a girl go crazy (4, 3, 2, ow, done lost your mind)
Boys, boys, boys
Make a girl go crazy, ow
