Rock n roll is good time music 
Rock n roll is good time music 

Mama said be a doctor son 
But a voice said follow the music 
Papa said be a lawyer boy 
But a voice said follow the mu' 
'Cause you know you're not doin' for the money 
You're doin' it just for the thrills 
You don't do it for money, boy 
So thank the Lord rock keeps payin' the bills 

Rock n roll is good time music 
Rock n roll is good time music  

You may think that life ain't no laughing matter 
And go right on a talkin' all your intellectual chatter 
Well all that jivin', it ain't true 
So let's just push on through 
Rock n roll to stay alive 
Rock n roll will survive 

Sneakin' Monica out after the prom 
You know I didn't get her back, people 
'Till just before dawn 
Outside we were creepin' 
Inside everyone was sleepin'
Goodness gracious! 
That's rock n roll! 

Rock n roll is good time music 
Rock n roll is good time music 
Rock n roll is good time music
