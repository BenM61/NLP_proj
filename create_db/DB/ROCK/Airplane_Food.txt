When Harry met Bob
Bob was an anarchist
Harry had a job
Working for the government

Married to the M.O.D.
Bob, he chose Adidas
Harry found God
Bobby lost weight

He said, "If I had a pound
For everything in town
That helped to bring me down
I could move somewhere nice"

Harry had a Ford
Drove it to the beach
Left his clothes on the shore
And walked into the sea

And it's airplane food
That keeps us on the move
Our radios are tuned
To the supermarket groove
And lift music

Everything is great
The trains are never late
The TV and the state
Keep us on the straight

But Harry couldn't wait
I guess Jesus was his mate
And they must have had a date
Because he couldn't stand another plate

Of Airplane food
Keeps us on the move
Our radios are tuned
To the supermarket groove
And lift music

Lo and behold
Twenty good as gold
Elevator greats
