My dreams zoom with us
My tears have run away
Our goal, goal collapsed
Energy of lonesome goal
May pushes, leaves and never feels
Shame casts offense
Shame casts her face
Star reason starring of the place

Safe at last
Seeing my thoughts in order
Safe, fallen down this way
I want to be just what I am

Steal more treasures, steal more gifts
This'll size creative lies
Until we grow up
It won't free you to go look for the key
My consciousness don't look away
What might keep them, but a slave
What might keep them, but a slave
My truth's not even, even half of what's

Safe at last
Seeing my thoughts in order
Safe, fallen down this way
I want to be just what I am

Safe at last
Seeing my thoughts in order
Safe, fallen down this way
I want to be just what I am

Safe at last
Seeing my thoughts in order
Safe at last

Safe at last
Seeing my thoughts in order
Safe, fallen down this way
I want to be just what I am
