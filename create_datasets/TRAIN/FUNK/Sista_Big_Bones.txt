Someday I'll be walking along 
And you'll step on the scene where I be 
Hopefully you'll be touched by my charm 
And the words of the song will lead the way 
Bright eyed and things long hair earrings 
Just a few things I like about you 

Sista big bones (big bones) 
Can a brother walk you home (can I walk right beside you) 
Look like a plate of neck bones (look so good, look so good) 
I like to keep your body warm (uh,huh) 

Frankly i admire your style 
How you go into work everyday 
Confident in your walk and your stride 
Got my note open wide, miss thing 

I'd like to take you on a nice date 
Shoot some riddles have some vittles with you 
Make no mistake i'll be a gentleman 
Take your coat open doors things I'll do

Look like a plate of neck bones (oh look so good, look so good)

Hold hands and walk with you 
Sing songs and stare at you
