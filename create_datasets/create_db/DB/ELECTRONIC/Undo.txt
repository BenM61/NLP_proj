It's not meant to be a strife
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill

It's not meant to be a strife
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill

You're trying too hard
Surrender
Give yourself in
You're trying too hard
You're trying too hard

It's not meant to be a strife
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill
Sweetly
It's not meant to be a strife
To enjoy
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill

It's warmer now lean into it
Unfold in a generous way
Surrender
Surrender
Undo
Undo

It's not meant to be a strife
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill

I'm praying
To be
In a generous mode
The kindness kind
The kindness kind
To share me
Quietly ecstatic

It's not meant to be a strife
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill

Undo
Undo if you're bleeding
Undo if you're sweating
Undo if you're crying

Undo
Undo
