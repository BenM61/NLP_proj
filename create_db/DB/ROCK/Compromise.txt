Last time you dramatized
I knew it was your job
And you really did it well
Next time you might criticize
I get so confused
What'll it be this time?
[Chorus]
Compromise
Compromise
Now, reflect, but not too long !
Those presses are waiting,
Can't miss that deadline !
Even at the best of times
You can't hope to please us all.
So what'll it be this time?
[Repeat Chorus]
Reload ... Then hide again
Each time a different view
How's your perspective?
Bending a little line
You ... could ... use ... a ...
very ... different ... kind ...
of ...
.. phrasing
What'll it be this time?
[Repeat Chorus]
