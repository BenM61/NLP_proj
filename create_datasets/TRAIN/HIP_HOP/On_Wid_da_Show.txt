It was a cool and lonely
Offishall style that coerced her to smile
Chalk another to the file
Quest for breasts, my intent to impress the mistress
So sess broke the ice like Gretzky
I told she give me your signature or number
Slumber could follow if I check you tomorrow
Who ate? Simply went to my gates
Now my bell apparatus, is switch to player status
With the fattest appeal, I spill, but can't knock
Eat chicken at three and the skin at four o'clock
Who? Again I reach the girl's door
Just call me FT 'cause her birthday suit is sore
Hit the floor in a hearts swift motion
Lotion the skin and like caress all me
Into the cup (what?)
Arm in the cup (what?)
Hittin' that spot that's G
You know I do your head sheet
That the hit was a nap and the biggest ever sold
Took five minutes for the cannon to explode
She said, "Do you love me?" And I said no
Then she slapped my face, I grabbed her and said ho
Do that again and the story gets told
The sticky was nice, but yo nuh get bold
'Cause Offishall's out for mine and then some
I hit some and leave some then on wid da show
Word up

One for the money and uh, two for my bros
And three is for the calls, pause
And four is for the drinks and stuff
And to bang with us and the game for the dough
Yo, on wid da show

One for the money and uh, two for my bros
And three is for the calls, pause
And four is for the drinks and stuff
And to bang with us and the game for the dough
Yo, on wid da show

I knew this girl named Susan
Fly skin from the islands, a Trini 
Always had a dress that's cut mini
And tempt to get praise and so the skin lay low
And only play a hostess, when the niggas got dough
One day I see her rollin' with this niggs that I knew
Walkin' through the uptown about a half past two
So I warn my niggs, word up she livin' foul
She just smiled and said, "Yo niggs you know my style"
Cool, aye watch out you're on your own
He took her to the palace his moms was not home
She undressed herself to reveal the irresistible
Coca-cola body while he's bobbin' like Motorola
Thirty-eight, thirty-two, forty-six, my, my, my
Only problem is she wouldn't spread her thighs
Said, "I need a hundred"
My nigga said well just suck up on my jewels until my headpiece swell
Yo she said do you love me and he said no
This king got dressed he grabbed her and said ho
Do what you do but no duckets will flow
Nice try, on the real niggas only make dough
You didn't think so

One for the money and uh, two for my bros
And three is for the calls, pause
And four is for the drinks and stuff
And to bang with us and the game for the dough
Yo, on wid da show

One for the money and uh, two for my bros
And three is for the calls, pause
And four is for the drinks and stuff
And to bang with us and the game for the dough
Yo, on wid da show

Now to my uptown rollers, go and get yours
If your sippin' over proof inside a Lex' coupe
Shotgun, was 'nough of them niggas that passed
Real G's make peace and get pieces that last (on the real)
On the real I ain't about bustin' steel
Praise the almighty, I won't sway not even slightly
Give thanks for my life and for my boys
And for my blood
For all them true heads that make noise
While niggas pose hard we do the Kardinal dance
While you're still leavin' a jam with your hands inside your pants
Kardinal Offishall will do it for you broke
Yo, 'cause one's for the money and we on wid da show
You didn't think so

One for the money and uh, two for my bros
And three is for the calls, pause
And four is for the drinks and stuff
And to bang with us and the game for the dough
Yo, on wid da show

One for the money and uh, two for my bros
And three is for the calls, pause
And four is for the drinks and stuff
And to bang with us and the game for the dough
Yo, on wid da show

One for the money and uh, two for my bros
And three is for the calls, pause
And four is for the drinks and stuff
And to bang with us and the game for the dough
Yo, on wid da show

Yeah yeah, Tasha Chase

When you get that tattoo on your arm?
I'm seeing your video again, and I just notice this tattoo
What is this tattoo going on?
You want me to show your grandmother this video?

You know whatever, anyways again
'Nough props, auntie's proud of you
