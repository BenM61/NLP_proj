Keep those golden days
From going separate ways
Keep the harbor lights
Burning inside
The streets of old
Can't hear the names they call
Shelter from the cold

Long ago, so far inside
Where the past still tries to hide
Find the dusty sun sleeping
Trying to sail where rapids run
Riding our frail ships out to the sun
Playing for time, searching for signs

Save the eyes so bright
Can't stop the things they see
From closing in the night
Long ago, so far away
Where the fires spark and play
Keep the softest flame burning

Trying to sail where rapids run
Riding our frail ships out to the sun
Playing for signs, searching for time
Long ago, so far away
Where the fires spark and play
Keep the softest flame burning
