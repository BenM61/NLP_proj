Lost, where you been?
Gold dripped on your skin
Dizzy, spinning
Gold dripped on your skin

What's it like from those hands?
Angels stay in
And just a taste, tasting
The soul reborn again, gain

Strobe light
Ultraviolet blue
Eyes are deep
Ultraviolet you

Staring, she's staring
Through a crowded room
Coming closer, you're sweating
It has a piece of you

You're smiling, teeth glowing
The angels stay in
Have a taste, a taste of
Soul reborn again, gain

Glowing in the park
Pearly whites in the dark
Throw a witch into a fire
'Cause the fire, we back
Glowing in the dark
Pearly whites in the park
Throw a witch into a fire
'Cause the fire, we burn

Strobe light
Ultraviolet blue
Eyes are deep
Ultraviolet you

Wanna send a little love
And let this play the beat
In between space and time
It's invisibility

Strobe light
Ultraviolet blue
Dancing eyes are deep
Ultraviolet you
(Ultraviolet blue)
Dancing eyes are deep
