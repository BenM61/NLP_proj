If you fear, my dear, the end is near,
Please do check your frontal hemisphere.
Bitty chicky thinks the sky will fall.
You should sense I've guessed, it just won't end at all.

It's hard to keep from hoarding when you wake up Monday morning.
In your life with no end in sight; You thought you'd die on Friday night.
Everybody, please keep trying, trying to party like it's 1999.
Even though we've got so much time, we need to spend it like it's 1999.

If you want to close the bar tonight,
Brace yourself 'cause there's no end in sight.
You can't pace yourself and you can't take it slow.
We have to drink it dry before this place is going to close.

It's hard to keep on spending
Every night like your life is ending
When every night there's another there,
Wearing you down in the moonlight's stare.
Everybody, please keep trying, trying to party like it's 1999.
Even though we've got so much time, we need to spend it like it's 1999.
