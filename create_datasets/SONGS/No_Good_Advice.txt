Daddy told me
Look into the future
Sit at your computer
And be a good girl

Momma said remember 
Your a lady
Think before you play
And straighten your curls

Well everybody's talkin'
Like I'm crazy
Dangerous and lazy
Girl with no soul
But I've seen it all
From where I'm hiding
Baby 'cause I'm sliding out of control

Here I go out the door
Crankin' the stereo
I think a finger 
To the world below oh

Here I am dirty hands
I don't give a damn
Shut your mouth cause it might show

I don't need no good advice
I'm already wasted

I don't need some other life
Cold and complicated

I don't need no Sunday trips
Tea and sympathizing

I don't need no special fix
To anesthetizers me

Daddy always told me 
Remember to leave the buzz till later
Don't you drop down

Momma said ill never get
To heaven hanging till 11
With the wrong crowd

Everybody's talkin'
Like they know me
Just another phony girl about play
But I dig the music
And I'm making baby 
And I'm breakin' into your brain

Here I go out the door
Cranking the stereo
I think a finger
To the world below oh

Here I am dirty hands
I don't give a damn
Shut your mouth 
'Cause it might show

I don't need no good advice
I'm already wasted

I don't need no other life
Cold and complicated

I don't need no Sunday trips
Tea and sympathizing

I don't need no special fix
To aneathatize me

Here I go out the door
Cranking the stereo
I think a finger to the world below

Here I am dirty hands
I don't give a damn
Shut your mouth
'Cause it might show

I don't need no good advice
I'm already wasted

I don't need no other life
Cold and complicated

I don't need no Sunday trips
Tea and sympathizing

I don't need no special fix
To anesthetizes me

I don't need no good advice
I'm already wasted

I don't need no other life
Cold and complicated

I don't need no Sunday trips
Tea and sympathizing

I don't need no special fix
To anesthetizes me
