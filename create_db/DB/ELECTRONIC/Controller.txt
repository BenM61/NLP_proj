Move me like a controller
Tell me what to do
Use me like a controller
All the way through
Keep me under your power
'Cause it's absurd
Move me like a controller
And move it well

Use me, use me (what you make me do, what you make me do)
Move me, move me (what you make me do, what you make me do)

Move me, it's all I want
Use me, it's all I want
Take all of me, it's all I want
'Cause I love what you're making me do

Take me like a controller
Save the world
Use me like a controller
Around that time
Show me all of the power
Show me who's on top
Move me like a controller
I know she's top

Use me, use me (what you make me do, what you make me do)
Move me, move me (what you make me do, what you make me do)

Move me, it's all I want
Use me, it's all I want
Take all of me, it's all I want
'Cause I love what you're making me do

Move me, it's all I want
Use me, it's all I want
Take all of me, it's all I want
'Cause I love what you're making me do

Tell me when to stop and when to go
'Cause I love what you're making me do

Tell me when to stop and when to go
'Cause I love what you're making me do

Tell me when to stop and when to go
'Cause I love what you're making me do

Tell me when to stop and when to go
'Cause I love what you're making me do
