Only God Can Judge Me
(Is that right)
Nobody else, Nobody else
All you other muthafuckas
Get out of my business

Perhaps, I was blind to tha facts
Stabbed in tha back
I Couldn't trust my own homies
just a bunch a dirty rats
Will I, succeed
paranoid from the weed
And hocus pocus try to focus
But I can't see
And in my mind
I'm a, blind man doin' time
Look to my future 
cause my past is all behind me
Is it a crime 
to fight for what is mine
Everybodies dyin'
Tell me, what's the use of tryin'
I've been trapped since birth
Cautious, cause I'm cursed
and fantansies of my family
in a hearse
And they say
It's the white man
I should fear
But, it's my own kind
Doin' all the killin' here
I can't lie
Ain't no love, for the other side
Jealousy inside
Make 'em wish I died
Oh my lord
Tell me what I'm livin' for
Everybodies droppin' 
got me knockin' on heaven's door
And all my memories
is seeing brothas bleed
And everybody grieves
But still nobody sees
regulate your thoughts
Don't get caught up in tha mix
cause the media is full of dirty tricks
Only God can Judge me

[Chorus]
Only God Can Judge Me(repeated several times)

I hear the doctor standing over me 
screaming I can make it 
Got a body full of bullet holes 
Laying here naked 
Still I can't breathe
something evil's in my I-V 
'cause everytime I breathe 
I think they're killing me 
I'm having nightmares 
Homicidal fantansies 
I wake up stranglin' 
Danglin' 
from my bed sheets 
I call the nurse 
'Cause it hurts 
To reminisce
How could it come to this? 
I wish they dind't miss 
somebody help me 
Tell me where to go from here?
'Cause even thugs cry 
but do the Lord care? 
Tryin' to remember 
But it hurts 
I'm walking through the cemetery 
talkin' to the dirt 
I'd rather die like a man 
than live like a coward 
there's a ghetto up in heaven 
and its ours 
Black Power 
Is what we scream 
As we dream 
In a paranoid state 
And our fate 
Is a lifetime of hate 
Dear mama, can you save me 
And f*ck peace 
'Cause the streets got our babies 
We got to eat 
No more hesitation 
each and every black males trapped 
And they wonder why we suicidal 
walkin' around strapped 
It's the police 
please try to see to this 
there's a million mutha-fuckas 
Stressing just like me
Only God can Judge Me

Only God Can Judge Me (repeated several times)

Powers that judge can not kill me 
but only make me stronger 
I don't see why everybody gotta feel 
as thou that they gotta tell me how to live my life,
Let me live baby 
Let me live

Pac I feel yah
Keep servin' it on the real ya
For instance, sayin'
Playa hatin' marks want to kill yah
Would you be wrong
For bucking a nigga into the pavement
He gonna get me first 
If I don't get him 
If you better start praying
Ain't no such thing
As, self defence 
In the court of law
So Judges when we get to where were gonna
we're in the cross
that's real
Gotti, lurk thee
Creep tha f*ck up on him
Sold a half a million tapes
No everybody want him
Now talkin' behind my back 
Like, a bitch would
Tellin' them niggas, "you can fade us"
Punk, I wish you would
It be the same mutha-fuckas in your face
gotta rush up in your place
to get your safe
Knowing you on that paper chase 
grass, glass
Big screen and leather couch
My new shit is so fine
I already sold a key of ounce
Bitch
Remember Tupac and 4-Tay
The same two brothas dodgin' bullets
And represtin' the Bay
Pac when you was locked down
That's when I'll be around
Start climbing up the charts
so sick but they try to clown 
that's why they ride the band-wagon
Still we draggin' sellin' live
Don't think I don't see you playa haters
I know you all wear disguises

Guess you figure you know me
'Cause I'm a thug 
that love to hit the late night club
drinkin' buzz 
living lavish like a playa all day 
I'm 'bout to floss 'em off 
Playa stick with 4-Tay

Only God Can Judge Me
