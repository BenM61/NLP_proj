Inside the Butterfly House
The wind blows in
From the pier
The Punch and Judy stand
Before you, the it disappears

I dim the lights
And tell your fortune
We'll be there soon

In the Butterfly House

Back to the sea
A ship comes in
To a half moon town

Hear the towers fall
And watch dreamland

Burn to the ground

I dim the lights
And tell your fortune
We'll be there soon

In the Butterfly House

Long ago
When the music played
From the steeple
To the bay
Time went by
In the warm summer sky
As we walked
Free of loneliness and doubt

In the Butterfly House
