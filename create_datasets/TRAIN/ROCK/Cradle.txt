I can see he says what he means
I can't say what he means when he says that
I'll pretend a pretty pretend
When all I wanna see is the end of this

I can see he says what he means
We'll deal him sticks and stones and apologies
I wish
Oh, I wish it was through

Scrape the skies
Get up off your knees
Just lift the marks
And new-found releases
I'll pretend a pretty pretend
When all I wanna see is the end of this

I wish
I wish
I wish the cobwebs would cover me
Cover me
Cover me

My vicious tongue cradles just one
My vicious tongue cradles just one

My vicious tongue cradles just one
My vicious tongue cradles just one
My vicious tongue cradles just one
My vicious tongue cradles just one

My vicious tongue cradles just one
