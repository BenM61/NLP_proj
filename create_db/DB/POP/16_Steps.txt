Lately I feel like I've been selling
Half of my soul to feel your love
I gave all of my faith to someone
Who's body is all that I know
Lately I feel like I've been feeling
Something you don't, so help me
Gotta pull you in close but I know
That I should be letting you go

A mess with it, a mess without it
I go down either way
Endless shots and countless hours
I wonder 'bout your place

It's only sixteen steps from your door to your bed
I should know better with your body next to mine
Can't help myself, help myself (only sixteen steps)

It's only sixteen steps from your door to your bed
I should know better with your body next to mine
Can't help myself, help myself (only sixteen steps)

Take me in slowly, hold me down and
Swallow your prayers, just spit me out
I wanna believe something that's
Different from what I've been told
(Different from what I've been told)
Take all my doubts so I can really
Be with you now and let my body
Really believe something that's
Different than letting you go (letting you go)

A mess with it, a mess without it
I go down either way
Endless shots and countless hours
I wonder 'bout your place

It's only sixteen steps from your door to your bed
I should know better with your body next to mine
Can't help myself, help myself (only sixteen steps)

It's only sixteen steps from your door to your bed

Only sixteen steps
Only sixteen steps
Only sixteen steps
Only sixteen steps
