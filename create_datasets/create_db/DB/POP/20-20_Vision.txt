My life was right in front of me but now she's gone
Now it's easy to see I was the one who was wrong
How could I be that close and yet so far of the track
Well I've got 20-20 vision but only looking back
Yes it's clear to me now but I should've seen it all along
Why was I so blind to what I had at home

When a woman's not satisfied it don't take her long to pack
Well I've got 20-20 vision but only looking back
Lord it hurts to see it all when there's nothing I can do
Loving her now that it's too late makes me just a fool
If I open my eyes in time the future would look so black
I've got 20-20 vision but only looking back
I've got 20-20 vision but only looking back
