I hear there's a classic mess out on Old 86,
A ride out there could be the thing to get us fixed
I left a shadow there last month stuck in the ground
Could still be around

And we laughed when the paddle boat sank
We were dancing on the propane tank
Everybody in the half-light out on the lawn
They were kicking up dust 'til they were gone

Oh oh oh, they were digging for something

Who's the shadow now? the party moved inside
I don't know how to dance this slow but I can try
One funny thing, I claimed to know the host
Yeah but I lied
Let's go you early riser

And we laughed when the paddle boat sank
We were dancing on the propane tank
Everybody in the half-light down at the pond
They were sinking in mud 'til they were gone

Oh oh oh, they were digging for something

It's just getting dark and you're waking up
Waking up, waking up
It's just getting dark and you're waking up
Waking up, waking up

Oh oh oh, they were digging for something
