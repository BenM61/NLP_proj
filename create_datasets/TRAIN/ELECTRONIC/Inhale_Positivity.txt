Inhale positivity, exhale negativity
Inhale positivity, exhale negativity
Inhale positivity, exhale negativity

Inhale positivity, exhale negativity
Inhale positivity, exhale negativity
Inhale positivity, exhale negativity

Enjoy the little things in life
Like the smell of a flower
The sound of a bird or the shape of a cloud

Do something different today, smile to a stranger on the street
Take a different way home or go by a CD
With music that you wouldn't have normally bought

Try not to be to hasty
In your judgment of other people
And take life less seriously

What you give will always come back double
Some people spend their whole life waiting for the storm
And never enjoy the sunshine

Inhale positivity, exhale negativity
Inhale positivity, exhale negativity

Take a deep breath
By taking five deep breaths everyday
It will help remove the build up of toxins in the body

It also lowers your cholesterol in the blood
And strengthens your mind
As you breathe out think only positive thoughts

Like what a great day this is going to be
Surround yourself with successful people
Don't feel threatened by them

Challenge yourself and learn from them
Because sccess has a mysterious way of attracting more success
Like negativity attracts more negativity

Inhale positivity, exhale negativity
Inhale positivity, exhale negativity
Inhale, exhale, negativity
Inhale, exhale, negativity

Inhale new life and positivity
And exhale pain, regrets and negativity

Inhale
