Can't believe I'm still here
With the morning so near
And last night so unclear 

I see a trembling hand
And a cold wedding band
Wonder where do I stand? 

When the wild life betrays me
And I'm too far from home
Will you be there to save me?
Will you shelter my heart til I'm strong?
Or will you just hang up the phone? 

Will my crazy old lies
And my worn out disguise
Turn to tears in your eyes 

What a fool I have been
There's no way I can win
Unless you take me back in 

When the wild life betrays me
And I'm too far from home
Will you be there to save me?
Will you shelter my heart til I'm strong?
Or will you just hang up the phone?
