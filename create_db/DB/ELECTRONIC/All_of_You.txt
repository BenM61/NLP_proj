It's a perfect day for a fight
Running after me in the pouring rain
Screaming: "Baby you were right
I need you, I need you"
Calling my name is a twisted game
Cause it wears me down till I love you more
Waking up to us making up makes it better than before

Oh, wind me up tight, convertible nights with you
Oh, I'll give you romance, a hundred last chances too
Sometimes you make it impossible
But I wanna go and get lost with you, my love
I want you to give me all of you

Get to know me, in your backseat
Drive me crazy, then you drive me home
The only place I wanna be
Is with you, is with you
Trying my luck when I work you off
Throwing all your clothes off the second floor
Waking up to us, making up makes it better than before

Oh, wind me up tight, convertible nights with you
Oh, I'll give you romance, a hundred last chances too
Sometimes you make it impossible
But I wanna go and get lost with you, my love
I want you to give me all of you
