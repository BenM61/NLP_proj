Blood was our favorite paint
You were my favourite pain
Waiting for your love to happen
Is like waiting for a drug that never kicks in

Left traces, red trails
Oceans, prayers, dance
You're in this radiance
Dismantled love
Touching in the snow one day
Laying low and kissing

Setting the snow on fire
Watching over vivid dreams
This too will pass
Under the moon we last
Arranging my friend's scenery
And inviting them to sing

Blood was our favorite paint
You were my favourite pain
Scratches when skin's too thin
Throwing me someone new to take in
