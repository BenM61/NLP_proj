I'm feelin' good like I knew that I would known
I'm gonna catch you, I'm gonna catch you baby

You know I'm leavin' this time anyway
So please don't stand in my way
I'm alright, just leavin' the past far behind
Your love, your feelin' kind

I don't like believin' so out lonely and round you go
I'd keep on runnin' and runnin' to you
You need somebody for lovin' and lovin' now till the end

With your love my heart'd feel so fine anywhere
I found myself so deep inside
Gotta hold and try to feel alright anyway
Just think about you're makin' love

I'm gonna catch you baby, baby
I'm gonna catch you baby, baby
I'm gonna catch you baby, baby
I'm gonna catch you baby, baby
I'm gonna catch you baby

You know I'll be this time on my way
So please don't ask me to stay
I will try to forget every face left behind
When love is by my side

I don't like believin', so out and lonely and round I'll go
I'll keep on runnin' and runnin' to you
You need somebody for lovin' and lovin' and lovin' now till the end

And with your love someone would be in love anyway
Realize he's just dreamin' inside
Gotta hold an try to feel alright anyway
When I turned you were turning aside

I'm gonna catch you baby, baby
I'm gonna catch you baby, baby
I'm gonna catch you baby, baby
I'm gonna catch you baby, baby
I'm gonna catch you baby

I'm gonna catch you baby, baby
I'm gonna catch you baby, baby
I'm gonna catch you baby, baby
I'm gonna catch you baby, baby
I'm gonna catch you baby, baby
