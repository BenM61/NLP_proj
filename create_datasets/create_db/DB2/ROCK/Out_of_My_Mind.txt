I doubt you've failed to see I'm out of my mind
Yeah it's for the sake of Christ that I'm this way
Ever since I gave Jesus all I have yeah I just
Can't keep this fire I've got inside, well you may think
It's a bad thing you say chill out you're just a little high strung
But the way I see it if I'm only seeking God's approval
Your disapproval won't bother me at all

Cause I'm out of my mind yeah
And I'm into the mind of Christ
I refuse to conform any longer 
To the pattern of this world I'm living in 
I'm not a good little church mouse boy any longer
From now on man I'm a man of God
Well you may think it's a bad thing you say chill out your just a little high strung
But the way I see it if I'm only seeking God's approval 
Your disapproval won't bother me at all

Laugh at me, put me down 
God told me such things would come
Disown me, you can ridicule me
I don't live my life for you
Cause you never died for me
