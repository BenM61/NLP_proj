take your hands off of him
he don't belong to you
Keep your hands off of him
he don't belong to you
he's mine, o mine, no matter what you do
he's long, lean and lanky
sweet as he can be
hands off of him, he belongs to me
Hands off of him, he don't belong to you
he's mine, o mine, no matter what you do
