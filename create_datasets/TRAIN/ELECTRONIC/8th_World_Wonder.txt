Woke up early this morning, made my coffee like I always do.
Then it hit me from nowhere, everything I feel about me and you.
The way you kiss me crazy, baby you're so amazing.

Seven days and seven nights of thunder,
The waters rising and I'm slipping under.
I think I fell in love with the eighth world wonder.

I guess that I'm just falling deeper into something I've never known.
But the way that I'm feeling, makes me realize that it can't be wrong.
You're love's like a summer rain, washing my doubts away.

Seven days and seven nights of thunder,
The waters rising and I'm slipping under.
I think I fell in love with the eighth world wonder.

It's only been a week, but it's coming over me.
It's making me believe that you're the one for me.

Seven days and seven nights of thunder,
The waters rising and I'm slipping under.
I think I fell in love with the eighth world wonder.
I think I fell in love with the eighth world wonder.
I think I fell in love with the eighth world wonder.
I think I fell in love with the eighth world wonder.
