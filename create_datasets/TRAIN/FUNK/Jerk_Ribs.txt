And my ear drum, reminds me
His name was just way down in my feet
And this moment, well, I can't breathe
You can't control, something that's getting free
And the rhythm's, exciting
Oh when I start this road full of streets
I'm glad you get this one for cheap

In Harlem, where I started to breathe
Your beat was like a soundtrack to me
I was the girl, my daddy was the world
He played the notes and keys
He said to look for melody in everything

It feels just like it should
I wake up, this, this is what it looks like
So don't miss this, this is what it looks like
So call on me, it feels just like it should
So call on me

The best favorites, go through me
I press the strings, I love everything
Hurtful pain, forget the time and keep staying
Hold the doors, dance and give it away
Just around me, I hear it
And melody was right over me
But whistleblowers happened for me

It feels just like it should
I wake up, this, this is what it looks like
So don't miss this, this is what it looks like
So call on me, it feels just like it should
So call on me

In Harlem, where I started to breathe
Your beat was like a soundtrack to me
I was the girl, my daddy was the world
He played the notes and keys
He said to look for melody in everything

It feels just like it should
I wake up, this, this is what it looks like
So don't miss this, this is what it looks like
So call on me, it feels just like it should
So call on me
