Almost cut my hair
Happened just the other day
It's gettin' kind of long
I could've said it was in my way

But I didn't and I wonder why
I feel like letting my freak flag fly
And I feel like I owe it, to someone, yeah

Must be because I had the flu this Christmas
And I'm not feeling up to par
And increases my paranoia
Like looking in my mirror and seeing a police car

But I'm not, I'm not giving in an inch to fear
'Cause I've promised myself this year
I feel oh, like I owe it,to someone

When I get myself together
I'm gonna get down in that sunny southern weather, yeah

I'm goin' find a space inside a laugh, yes
Separate the wheat from some chaff
I feel
Like I owe it, yeah, to someone
