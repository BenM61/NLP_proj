Your name in lights 
Vibrating to your ring tone 
My world begins to dance 
We discuss important stuff 
The rendezvous is set up 
To catch a film and dinner 

Stuck in a cinema or 
Saving me from a car your 
Suddenly realize I'm falling into my arms 
Working you under cover 
Softly slowly got ya 
Any moment now your gonna swoon 
Into my arms 

A same you 
A same me 
Spoon feeding the ground dark soil 
A friend too good to go there with 
Shake it up and get it on 
Oh well I know you know you do 
And maybe you've not said so many words 
You've always got your reasons 
You right little know it all 

Stuck in a cinema or 
Saving me from a car your 
Suddenly realize I'm fall into my arms 
Working you under cover 
Softly slowly got ya 
Any moment now your gonna swoon 

Let me be the great Scott 
Tip top pit stop in your ocean! 
I could be the shipmate's wife 
Got you down and dirty with the lotion 

This is where I was going to sing your name 
Over and over again 
But I chickened out 
In the final minute 
Cause I thought you probably wouldn't like it 

Swoon and fall into my arms 

Let me be the great Scott 
Tip top pit stop in your ocean 
I could be the shipmate's wife 
Got you down and dirty with the lotion! 

Let me be the great Scott 
Tip top pit stop in your ocean 
I could be the shipmate's wife 
Got you down and dirty with the lotion!
