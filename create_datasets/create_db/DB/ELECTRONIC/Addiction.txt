Should I drink another drink
See another light
I know that you may think
That I'm a broken little bird in my mind

Cause I'm falling on the floor
I'm climbing up the walls
And every time I get a grip
I seem to lose myself just a little more

'Cause I am here and it eats me up
Well, I love the way it feels
I really shouldn't stay
But I can't give up
The more it hurts, the more I need

It's like an addiction
It's like an addiction

Should I drink another drink
Am I running out of time
Confusion makes me think
This solution is beyond my sorry mind

'Cause I am here and it eats me up
Well, I love the way it feels
I really shouldn't stay
But I can't give up
The more it hurts, the more I need

It's like an addiction
And I just can't break free tonight
It's like an addiction
Am I the only one with the sad eyes
It's like an addiction
And I just can't break free tonight
It's like an addiction
Am I the only one with the sad eyes

I can't let go
I, I, I can't let go
I, I

It's like an addiction
And I just can't break free tonight
It's like an addiction
Am I the only one with the sad eyes
It's like an addiction
And I just can't break free tonight
It's like an addiction
Am I the only one

I can't let go
I, I, I can't let go
I, I

I can't let go
I, I, I can't let go
I, I
