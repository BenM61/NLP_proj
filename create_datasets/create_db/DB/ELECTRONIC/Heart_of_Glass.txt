Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out her heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find much o' mistrust
Love's gone behind

Once I had a love and it was divine
Soon found out I was losing my mind
It seemed like the real thing but I was so blind
Much o' mistrust
Love's gone behind

In between what I find is pleasing and I'm feeling fine 
Love is so confusing, there's no peace of mind
If I fear I'm losing you
It's just no good, you teasing like you do

Ooh, aah

Ooh, aah

Once I had a love and it was divine

Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out to be a pain in the ass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find much o' mistrust
Love's gone behind

Lost inside
Adorable illusion and I cannot hide
I'm the one you're using please don't push me aside
We coulda made it cruising yeah

It's just no good, you teasing like you do

Ooh, aah
Ooh, aah

Ooh
Aah

Ooh 
Aah

Ooh
Aah
