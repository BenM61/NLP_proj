I back down.
I believe it's true.
I fall down in the shade of you
I am secret. 
You keep it inside.
You have to tell. 
You have to try.
When I grow up you'll be alone
You'll want too much.
Never sleep.
You'll want my face.
You'll want my name.
You'll want my eyes.

And that's just more than I can give. 
That's just more than I can give
I'm gonna save myself first

I laugh when I remember when.
You fail with words and try again
And bring the words into your hands.
Onto my skin and there it lands
You want the light inside my body.
Makes you nervous. 
Makes you naughty.
You want truth inside the lie.
You want the hurt

Burn the house down when you sleep.
Talk my way out of speculation.
Change my name.
Run away. Hold my breath.
I always stay. think about the things I do.
When I can kill the fear in you.
Suffocate you with the joke.
I can't stop laughing. 
Suffocate you with the joke.
I can't stop laughing

And that's just more than I can give.
That's just more than I can give.
I'm gonna save myself first
I don't have any more.
