Like the men that were before me, he said
"The dawn of the dead came toward me," I'm afraid.
You could try again but they'll ignore you, and me
I want to sit down and say that will do, I'm afraid
Today I stood and walked away
I'm never coming back this way
I've got my things, I'm here to stay
I'll try to pull the night away

(Oh, Ah, Oh, Ah)
If you say so
I'll leave home, I'll leave home
If you say so
I'll leave home, I'll leave home
Like the dead that walk before me therein
I can't believe that you ignore me, such a shame
I didn't come here to try to hurt you, you hurt me
I'll never sit back and say "that'll do," I'm afraid.

Today I stood and walked away
I'm never coming back this way
I've got my things, I'm here to stay
I'll try to pull the night away

(Oh, Ah, Oh, Ah)
If you say so
I'll leave home, I'll leave home
If you say so
I'll leave home, I'll leave home, I'll leave home
Today I stood and walked away
I'm never coming back this way
I've got my things, I'm here to stay
I'll try to walk another way [Repeat x2]
(Oh, Ah, Oh, Ah)
If you say so
I'll leave home, I'll leave home
If you say so
I'll leave home, I'll leave home, I'll leave home
