Those happy hours I spent with you 
That lovely afterglow 
Most of all, I miss you so 

Your sweet caresses, each rendezvous 
You voice so soft and low 
Most of all, I miss you so 

You once filled my heart with 
No regrets, no fears 
Now you'll find my heart 
Filled to the top with tears 

I'll always love you and ant you, too 
How much you'll never know 
Most of all, I miss you so
