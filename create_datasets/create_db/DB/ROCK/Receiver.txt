Hey dear, you know I hate to go
Just lay here listening to the radio
Upstairs, hiding from the world below
The day fading on the dial

Downstairs, wait for the mailman
On lawn chairs spread across the tableland
Somewhere flowerbeds to lay your hand in mine
If you stay then I will, time fading on the dial

I will always love you like I do
I'll always love you like I do
The song is fading still it's true
When I'm here beside you

You said you want a wing to fly
A loose thread hanging from the gingham sky
We knew that we would have to say goodbye
C'mon, if you would then I'd stay
The sun pulling in the driveway

I will always love you like I do
I'll always love you like I do
The song is fading still it's true
When I'm here beside you

I will always love you like I do
I'll always love you like I do
The song is fading still it's true
When I'm here beside you
