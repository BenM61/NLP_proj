Go on, come with it 
Hear me now 
Breakout 

I woke from a dream 
Looked up to see your face was 
Smiling down at me 
The sunlight crept through 
Painting my room and I just 
Had to say 
Primrose colored paths lay at your feet 

Keep it coming 
Don't you stop loving 
I'm high 
Tripping on your love 
Keep it coming 
Don't you stop loving 
I'm high 
Tripping on your love 

Straight out of the blue 
Drowning in you it's such a sweet sensation
And I'm floating above 
This heavenly love and through my 
Mirror I see 
Magic multicolored painted dreams 

Keep it coming 
Don't you stop loving 
I'm high 
Tripping on your love 
Keep it coming 
Don't you stop loving 
I'm high 
Tripping on your love 

Trip on my love
Trip on my love
Trip on my love
Trip on my love

Dance on the mike one day with this drama 
Tripping on my love with the Bananarama 

Primrose colored paths lay at your feet 

Keep it coming 
Don't you stop loving 
I'm high 
Tripping on your love 
Keep it coming 
Don't you stop loving 
I'm high 
Tripping on your love 
 
Keep it coming 
Don't you stop loving 
I'm high 
Tripping on your love
