How can I get your love
When you keep on snatching it back
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me girl

How can I get your love
When you keep on snatching it back
That's what I want to know right now girl

How you expect for me to get it
When you keep on, doing like that

You want me, and I want you
But you're afraid, that I won't be true
I get your love, in the palm of my hand
You change your mind, and snatch it back again

So tell me
How can I get your love
When you keep on snatching it back
Oh, you want to tell me now, girl

How can I get your love
When you keep on snatching it back
That's what I want to know, I want to know, I want to know

How you expect for me to get it
When you keep on, doing like that

Some other man, before my time
Must have loved you, and left you behind

Now you're afraid, that I'll hurt you
But I won't do anything, you don't want me to

So tell me
How can I get your love
When you keep on snatching it back
Oh, I want to know right now, right now girl

How can I get your love
When you keep on snatching it back
You don't have to do me like that, baby

I want to do
How can I get your love
When you keep on snatching it back
Oh you know I love you baby

How can I get your love
When you keep on snatching it back
