The precious time that they had left was down to 45
He knew if he could save her breath that it would take a while
She was sleeping in an empty cell won't eat and so
Broken by compliers agent 30 back and 409

He was starting to believe that he was paranoid
How could something so beautiful be a humanoid?
Meeting in the rubble piling up since back in '39
Looking for a way to make sure he didn't blow her mind

I'm not running, datascroller
Your evil ideas won't win here
You're getting nowhere

We stand around her sentence in the story
Do they really know how it feels to be that lonely?
