You're facinating, yet mysterious.
So captivating;
I'm just curious,
Is heaven missing you?
'Cause, Lord knows, when you're gone... I do.
So when you get home, girl...

When you get home tonight,
Here's what I'd like to do:
Start in the shower; massage ya
Till you're in the mood.
When you get home tonight,
Girl, I'll show you.
I want you, (want you baby,)
And I want you to want me too.

Girl, your shower's ready;
Steamy hot for you.
Crystal popped for two,
To get you in the mood.
I'll sing like Marvin Gaye,
'Cause girl, I want you more
Every single day. (Tell me...)

Who, who loves you baby, more than I do?
Maybe God above.
And who takes good care of you,
When you're lonely?
You're my tender love,
Oh, girl.

When you get home tonight,
Here's what I'd like to do:
Start in the shower; massage ya
Till you're in the mood.
When you get home tonight,
Girl, I'll show you.
I want you, (want you baby,)
And I want you to want me too.

When you get home... 

When you get home tonight,
Here's what I'd like to do:
Start in the shower; massage ya
Till you're in the mood.
When you get home tonight,
Girl, I'll show you.
I want you, (want you baby,)
And I want you to want me too.

Who, who loves you baby, more than I do?
Maybe God above.
And who takes good care of you,
When you're lonely?
Tender lover, come on home.

All you lovely ladies,
All around the world.
Baby, I want you.
Do you want me too?
All you sexy ladies,
All around the world.
Baby, I want you.
Do you want me too?

When you get home tonight,
Here's what I'd like to do:
Start in the shower; massage ya
Till you're in the mood.
When you get home tonight,
Girl, I'll show you.
I want you, (want you baby,)
And I want you to want me too.

When you get home tonight.
