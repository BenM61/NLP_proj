Stop. Hey man, there's a way 
Save me just for a sunny day 
Oh I wanna, yes I want your heart 
Choo choo choo 
Young hearts are full of pride 
And you never see what's deep inside 
Oh I wanna, yes I wanna 
Give my heart to you 

Summer kisses 
A summer in love 
Summer kisses 
Oh I'm dreaming of 
Summer kisses 
Forever in love 
Summer kisses 
Oh I need that stuff 

Stop. Hey man, hear me 
Give me your love, what's gonna be?
Oh I wanna, yes I want your heart 
Choo choo choo 
Hey you, my words are true 
Do you feel my love, oh, like I do?
Oh I wanna, yes I wanna 
Give my heart to you

Summer kisses 
A summer in love 
Summer kisses 
Oh I'm dreaming of 
Summer kisses 
Forever in love 
Summer kisses 
Oh I need that stuff 

Summer kisses 
A summer in love 
Summer kisses 
Oh I'm dreaming of

Forever in love

Oh I need that 
Oh I need that
