Try to make it better, better together

Every day, every time 
There's a street and here we are 
We the people make the world, look how it's going down 
So we walked into our lives 
No one look deep in the eyes 
Except you, take my smile 
That's the only thing I have 

Hope you're fine 
Hope you're great 
Hope you're not alone in this town 
Hope you have good friend to talk 
Hope you will soon find a job 
Now you smile right back at me 
You see that is what I need 

Love and hope can get for free 
I'm gonna need it 
I'm gonna use it 
I'm gonna need it 
I'm gonna use it

You have dreams, too many in a depressed society 
For my hair, have to rest
Have to stop watching TV 
I'll go outside, I'll walk some more 
To see what is next to me 
And I saw you and then I knew 
How a smile can give some peace 

Hope you love 
Hope you're strong 
Hope you will not get it wrong 
Stop your bullshit, then make freak 
Love is hard but it's unique 

I'm gonna need it 
I'm gonna use it 
I'm gonna need it 
Yeah, I'm gonna use it
