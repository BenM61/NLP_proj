A familiar song
Won't you sing along
Something to prolong the waiting

In this secret place
Where we can embrace
All the history in the making

And we come in, to see you
All alone again
Don't forget to go outside
To go outside your shell
Don't regret what you denied
What you denied, what you denied

All the casualties 180 degrees
Lip sink every breathe were taking
Somewhat static lines
Reaching out tonight
It's the mode and mould were breaking

And we come in, to see you
All alone again
Don't forget to go outside
To go outside your shell
Don't regret what you denied
What you denied, what you denied

Don't forget to go outside your shell
Don't regret what you denied yourself

In the harmony
Ride along with me
It won't work if you've been faking

And we come in
To see you, all alone again
Don't forget to go outside your shell
Don't regret what you denied yourself

Don't forget to go outside your shell
Don't regret what's left behind. yourself
