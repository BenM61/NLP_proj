Everyone wants to be the cowboy living life the wild wild west style
Everyone wants to be the outlaw
Well everyone tough and no one is gonna back down
Everyone's tough and no one is gonna back down
Everyone wants to be the superstar live like a star and driving the fancy car
Everyone wants to get some fame playing the man's game
Everyone tough and no one is gonna back down
Capone said him tough and no one is gonna back down

Hey yo warning to informers and traitors first one die will be the instigator
Who died and left you commentator outer body experience see it's not all good
Look into the eyes of who was once Clint Eastwood
Fire koombaya for back up call Libya soldiers hold your fire I see Ethiopia
I hear you boast about who you toast around the coast
But once you hear the fire you vanish like human ghost sucker
Everyone wants to be the cowboy living life the wild wild west style
Everyone wants to be the outlaw
Well everyone's tough and no one is gonna back down
Everyone's tough and no one is gonna back down
Sandokas said him tough and no one is gonna back down
Jesse James said him rough and no one is gonna back down
