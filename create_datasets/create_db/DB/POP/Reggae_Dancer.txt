I know a reggae dancer 
From Kingston Jamaica 

She knows how to bump 
Knows how to grind this little girl 
She ruft all the time 
She knows how to sing she don't 
Drink gin, knock three times 
She'll let you into her world 
Of sweet reggae music 

This irie crisp sister 
This ruft reggae dancer 
Her musical magic 
Just got to have it 

Better get ready to hold on steady 
Don't distress it just respect it 
Gone too far to turn back now 
You made the right move you're in the groove 
In her world of sweet reggae music
