Now close this chapter
Time to move on
Just one last time and I'm gone
Keep telling myself that it's fun to control
And that's a lie I did well know
I'll return to the scene of the crime
And I'll gather my pride
Still I know you'll be long gone
Nausea comes as the fear builds inside
Seems much stronger than I
Still I know you're gone

I can remember
The day that you told me
I won't be there, I'm not that strong
Holding these memories
I feel unfolding
This is the last time
Now I'm gone

Not close
It's time to move on
Just one last time and I'm gone
Done holding my breath
Keep praying it's over
Still I fear what's coming
I'll return to the scene of the crime
Seems much stronger than I
Still I know

I can remember
The day that you told me
I won't be there, I'm not that strong
Holding these memories
I feel unfolding
This is the last time
Now I'm gone

Now I can see the light of day from here
I guess you helped make me strong
And when I think of what you put me through
It's better that we moved on

And I'll close this chapter
Move on
Soon I'll be long gone
And I walk away
And I walk away from
From you

I can remember
The day that you told me
I won't be there, I'm not that strong
Holding these memories
I feel unfolding
This is the last time
Now I'm gone
