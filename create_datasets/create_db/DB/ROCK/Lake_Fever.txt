We can take a bit of a breather
We can skip to the practical part
We can skip to the time of neither
When we're together and even
When we're apart

I'll tell you a story about the Lake fever or
We can skip to the coital fury
You didn't say yes or no, neither
You whispered, hurry
Hurry
Hurry
Hurry

We can take it a little bit further
We can stick to the after effects part
'Not trying to make you a believer,
Don't want to a lil' piece of your heart

Just telling you a story about the Lake fever
Or we can skip to a neutral fury
You didn't say yes or no neither
You whispered, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry

Want to be a nobody without peer
Want to be a thought that's never done
Want to shake your faith in human nature
Want to break the hearts of everyone

Want to be your wheezing screen door
Want to be your stars of Algonquin
Want to be your roaring floorboard
Want to break the hearts of everyone

'Cause discontent until they,
Cease in their investigation
Bring back the days events
Good citizens and time well spent
'Til we're talking in whispers again
Until we're talking in whispers again (you whispered, hurry)

Until we're talking in whispers again (you whispered, hurry)
Until we're talking in whispers again (you whispered, hurry)
Until we're talking in whispers again
