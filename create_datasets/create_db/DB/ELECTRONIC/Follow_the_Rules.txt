Follow the rules of life
Don't let them change your mind
Take a good look inside
And do the right thing, do the right thing

Follow the rules of life
Don't let them change your mind
Take a good look inside
And do the right thing, do the right thing

Woahoa!

You, only you can achieve
If you follow your dreams
They will come true
If you strive to, If you pay all your
dues don't you stray
Don't let anything stand in your way
In this world today
Your time will come, come any day

You, only you can achieve
If you follow your dreams
They will come true
If you strive to, If you pay all you dues oh!

Don't you ever stop movin', don't you ever stop
Don't you ever stop climbing till you reach the top
You can have it all, you can be whatchya wanna be
You can stand tall, and you can be free
