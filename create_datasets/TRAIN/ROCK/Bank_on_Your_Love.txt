One lonely eye faces the queen
How far she goes remains to be seen
She can be hard and she knows it
She plays her heart and doesn't show it
Cold night cold like me
No love lost betting on the king

And it's a hard unknown
Before the hand is showing
The con is out when the eagle flies
If you know the hand is quicker than the eye

Can I bank on your love

Hands down left high and dry
Games in the night are quicker than the eye
That ain't love or affection
The dealer changed direction
Bets are high and I'm losing enough
Won't anybody play fair with my love

'Cause it's hard not knowing
And my heart is showing
The king is out and the eagle flies
Don't you know the hand is quicker than the eye

Can I bank on your love
