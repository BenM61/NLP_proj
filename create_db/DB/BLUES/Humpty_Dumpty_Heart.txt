Who's giving that line to you?
You think it's divine, do you?
You're a crazy Humpty Dumpty heart.
You're letting a grin kid you,
You never did win, did you?
Just a silly Humpty Dumpty heart.
Don't mean to criticize, or say I'm wise,
But if you will just recall, you sat on a garden wall,
And you know what happened
You'll still have a chance won't you?
You sure want romance, don't you
Hope, you're lucky, Humpty Dumpty heart.
