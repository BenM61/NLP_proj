Red shoes
Blue car
Never run 
Too far

push
Us along
We're so weak
And they're so strong
All I ever need

The mercy of your lies
All I ever need
The mercy of your lies
And the clouds that break
And the clouds that break

Red shoes
Blue car
Never run 
Too far

Winds push
Us along
We're so weak
And they're so strong

All I ever need
The mercy of your lies
All I ever need
The mercy of your lies

And the clouds that break
