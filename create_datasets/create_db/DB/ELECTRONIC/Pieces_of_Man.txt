I was awake, alone, afraid, confused
The only love I knew, the only love I knew
You were the only love I knew and I was afraid

Scars don't heal
When they grow on the inside
The mind can't kill
What it sees on the outside

Too young to know
Too young to understand
Force fed the real thing
I didn't know what it meant back then

And now you wonder what went wrong
How can you wonder what went wrong?

Love wasn't explained
Try spending that much time alone
I know this pain
Over time it only grows

Didn't wanna believe
Tried not to let it show
Everything inside me
You took more than you'll ever know

And now you wonder what went wrong?
How can you wonder? You were wrong
You were wrong

Pieces of man
I'm learning the hard way what I am
Pieces of man
Destroyed, destroyed

Fistful of control
You planted this seed inside
Too many times, too many times
This time you can't deny

You were wrong, you were wrong
You were wrong, you were wrong

Pieces of man
I'm learning the hard way what I am
Pieces of man
Destroy, destroy

I was afraid, I was alone and confused
I was afraid, I was afraid
You were the only love I knew
And I was afraid, afraid

Pieces of man
I'm learning the hard way what I am
Pieces of man
Destroy, destroy

Pieces of man
I'm learning the hard way what I am
Pieces of man
Destroy, destroy

You were wrong, you were wrong
You were wrong, you were wrong
