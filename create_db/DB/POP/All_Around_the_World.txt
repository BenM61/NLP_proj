Once again, the dynamic duo's back at it
J-B, Luda!
I love everything about you
You're imperfectly perfect
Everyone is itching from beauty
But you're scratching the surface
Lost found is never found
Can the DJ please reverse it?
In lights we pay for change
Let's make every second work it
Any day can work it if you're working with people saying
You don't deserve it and don't give in
'Cause hate may win some battles but love wins in the end
You shine just like the sun while the moon and the starts reflect your light
Beauty revolves around you
So you like that?

All around the world people want to be loved
All around the world, they’re no different than us
All around the world (all around the world, people want to be loved)
All around the world (all around the world, they’re no different than us)
All around the world (all around the world, people want to be loved)
All around the world (all around the world, they’re no different than us)
All around the world
