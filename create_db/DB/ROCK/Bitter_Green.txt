Upon the bitter green she walked the hills above the town
Echoed to her footsteps as soft as eiderdown
Waiting for her master to kiss away her tears
Waiting through the years

Bitter green they called her walking in the sun
Loving everyone that she met
Bitter green they called her waiting in the sun
Waiting for someone to take her home

Some say he was a sailor who died away at sea
Some say he was a prisoner who never was set free
Lost upon the ocean he died there in the mist
Dreaming of a kiss

Bitter green they called her walking in the sun
Loving everyone that she met
Bitter green they called her waiting in the sun
Waiting for someone to take her home

But now the bitter green is gone the hills have turned to rust
There comes a weary stranger whose tears fall in the dust
Kneeling by the churchyard in the autumn mist
Dreaming of a kiss

Bitter green they called her walking in the sun
Loving everyone that she met
Bitter green they called her waiting in the sun
Waiting for someone to take her home

Bitter green they called her walking in the sun
Loving everyone that she met
Bitter green they called her waiting in the sun
Waiting for someone
To take her home
