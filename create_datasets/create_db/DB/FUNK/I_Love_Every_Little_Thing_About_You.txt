Though they say you're not my friend
You've been here through thick and thin
And for that little girl I love ya
And all I want to do is talk about ya

I'm here to say
I love you more each day
And I just want to tell the world
That I love you so

Though they put me down because
I love you as much as I do
But they don't know what you've done for me
You've made such a happy man out of me

And I'm here to say
Love you everyday, yeah
And I just want to tell the world
That I love you so

Baby (I love, I love, I love, I love every little thing)
About you baby
Oh yeah (I love, I love, I love, I love every little thing)
Everything about you baby, mm yeah

Though they say that I am wrong
'Cause my love is strong
There's only one that I place above you
It's God that I place above you

Girl I just want to say
Love you more each day, yeah
I just want to tell the world
That I love you so, yeah

Some folks say that it's strange
But my whole life you have changed
You've saved all the pain the world's put on me
All I wanna do is talk about you and I'm here to say
Love you everyday, yeah yeah
