Everything changed.
I don't feel the same.
I'm standin' in the shower and cryin'.
It shouldn't be that hard,

I've made it this far.
Just wash away the tear that keeps fallin'.
I don't know why I never take the time
To slow down. 

You're movin' too fast
Nothin' will last.
Everthing changed,
Nobody to blame,

Just put away my heart and stop tryin'.
I don't when I'll ever love again.
Got to slow down,
Movin' too fast.

Nothin' will last.
I don't know why I never take the time
To slow down. 
You're movin' too fast

Nothin' will last.
Slow down...
Slow down...
