The one who has me for his own
Is on the town and I'm alone;
In his blue suit and his new tie
He slammed the door without goodbye!

Tonight my eyes are jealous green,
Tonight I'm melancholy mean!
He meets, in secret rendezvous,
Some dame to tell his troubles to,
The heel!

He'll promise her most anything,
A sable coat, a diamond ring;
She'll find him out when it's too late,
And all she gets will be a date!

But while the dawn's a distant thing,
In his embrace her heart will sing;
Her dizzy head will spin with lies,
And all too soon a woman cries,
"The heel!".

The neon lights that flash below
Ignite my room with double glow;
And in the room I hear a laugh,
It's coming from his photograph!

I ring my hands and walk the floor,
And swear to even up the score!
For where a kitten cried tonight,
A panther waits to claw and bite
The heel!

I dare not play my radio,
One more complaint and out I go!
I'm sick of playing solitaire,
The ace of spades is everywhere!

There'll be no sleep for me tonight,
The sheep I count are never white!
They all turn out to be jet black,
And who's the leader of the pack?
The heel!

At dawn I know he'll stagger in,
Demanding coffee black as sin,
And as I take it from the tin,
I slip a little powder in!

He'll look at me and start to cry,
And cross his heart and hope to die!
And mumble "I know how you feel,
But I've been on a business deal!",
The heel!

Then as the pot begins to perk,
I know my plan will never work!
But when he starts to drink it up,
I'll grab his hand and break the cup!

It's only jealousy, I know,
That brought my thinking down so low!
Why must I wait for him and grieve?
Why don't I just pack up and leave
The heel?!

But no he's really on the stair,
I'll try to act like I don't care!
For in my heart's arithmetic
I find it takes two heels to click!

We're in a web of love and hate,
Where it will end is up to fate!
I'll let him have his little fling;
I'll be the chewing gum that clings
To the heel!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
