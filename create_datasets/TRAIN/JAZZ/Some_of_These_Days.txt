Some of these days you're gonna be so lonely,
Some of these days you're gonna want me only,
You'll miss my love and miss my kiss,
You're gonna miss your little daddy when he goes away!

You'll be so lonely alone without me,
You know, baby, why I went away;
Oh, when I'm leaving, there's no doubt your heart'll be grieving;
You're gonna miss your daddy, mama, some of these days.
