Descending on the city like a plague of locusts
Put up barbed wire fences as if we wouldn't notice
Figuring out how to spend our money
It's laughable
But, it sure ain't funny
Pigs is pigs
I can't relate
You represent everything I hate
There's no justice
There's no peace
Being thrown in black vans by secret police

A.C.A.B
Until last June meant nothing to me
A.C.A.B
Until last June meant nothing to me
A.C.A.B
Until last June meant nothing to me
A.C.A.B

There's smoke in the distance
Not from the houses on the hill
Black bloc is downtown burning cop cars
They're just doing it for the thrill

A.C.A.B
Until last June meant nothing to me
A.C.A.B
Until last June meant nothing to me
A.C.A.B
Until last June meant nothing to me
A.C.A.B

No. no. no. no. no
No. no. no. no. no
Like the pride before the fall
They can't arrest us all
Like the pride before the fall
They can't arrest us all

A.C.A.B
Until last June meant nothing to me
A.C.A.B
Until last June meant nothing to me
A.C.A.B
Until last June meant nothing to me
A.C.A.B
