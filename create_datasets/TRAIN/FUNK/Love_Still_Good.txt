Is the love still good (Still good, baby)
Is the love still good (Still good, baby)
Still good, baby (You gotta know)
You know I'm free
Out on parole
Just got my papers, honey
I'm really home
So what's going on, suga
How is your life, baby
It's so good to be back
You're still fine as the day we met
Oh, I heard you got babies, that's cool
Do they play at the park where we used to make love after dark
Is the love still good
Is the love still good (Still good, baby, uh)
Still good, baby (You know, you wanna know, baby, oh oh)
(Still good, baby, baby)
I didn't know
I was your first
I was your soldier, baby
Everything real
But you found another
And I understand, lover
'Cause I lost my brother
From the war on drugs
Got so much, baby
I could offer you
I'm a man, not the boy that I was
So why gamble with life in the streets when I got you at home, baby
Is the love still good (Oh, baby)
Is the love still good (Still good, baby)
Still good, baby (Wanna know, baby, gotta know, baby)
Ooh
Hey ey
Still good, baby
Is love still good, babe
Is the love still good (Still good, baby)
Is the love still good (Still good, still good, baby)
Still good, baby (Tell you that, still good, baby, still good, baby)
I remember back in the day
We used to vibe around the way
You told me you loved me, wish I had stayed
Right there in your arms underneath the stars
We still made beautiful love
Every night, every day
We would wake up
To a brighter morning, baby
You were here for me
Why did you walk out on me, baby
When I went down
When I went down, baby
I still remember every night in your basement
There in the dark, we made love
Your lovin' was so sweet, reminiscin'
We got much time, baby, to catch up, oh, lady
So let's take our time, baby
Get to know each other all over again
I'm not the same boy, I'm a man, lady lover
Oh, lover, lover
Oh, baby, do you still wind it up like you used to back in the day
