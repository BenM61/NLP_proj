Been ten years but I was a young man.
Fifteen more and I'll be old.
Couple years I may be a rich man,
where it ends up I don't really know.

Looking out your weathered windows,
reaching for what you can't hold.
Considering the ways that the wind blows,
where it ends up you don't really know.
You're just looking for a reason and a place to call your own.

Nacogdoches up to Lucas, could you pick a better place to lose some change?
Down in Kemah it might seem a little too long a walk out to La Grange.
Corsicana, they might slam you. You'll be thirsty for a glass of lemonade.
Try to slow down and hang around along the way.

From Odessa up to Dumas, could you pick a better place to lose some change?
In Abiline, it might seem like Uvalde couldn't be further away.
Waxahatcha they could catch you, chase you way back to Matagorta Bay.
