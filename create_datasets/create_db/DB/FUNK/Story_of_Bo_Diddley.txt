I was born one night about twelve o'clock
(Ha-ha-ha)
I come in this world playin' a gold guitar
My father was around stickin' out his chest
(Hee-hee)
A-now, mama this boy he gon fee' you a mess (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Yeah, yea-ha, ooh, uh-huh

Now, people came from miles around
Yeah, just to hear my little guitar sound
Now, some of 'em said I had what it takes
If I keep on practice I'd be famous one day (Ha-ha)
Woo, I'm a mess!
I'm a killer-diller
Uh-huh, yea-hey, a-uh, uh-huh

Early in the middle of the night
A car drove up with four headlights (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Now, a man stepped out wit' a long cigar
He said, 'Sign this line and I can make you a star' (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
I said, 'Now, what's in it man, what's in it for me? '
He says,  play yo' guitar son and wait an see'
Here I am! (heh-heh-heh, heeee)
The girls liked me, they say, 'It's crazy, it sound nice, uh-huh

My first engagement was in Chicago
I played fo' some people I'd never seen before
It was good too (ha-ha-ha-ha)
They like it
Sound nice
