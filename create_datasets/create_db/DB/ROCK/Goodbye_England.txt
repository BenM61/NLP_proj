You were so smart then
In your jacket and coat.
My softest red scarf was warming your throat.
Winter was on us,
At the end of my nose,
But I never love England more than when covered in snow.

And a friend of mine says it's good to hear you believe in love even if set in fear
Well I'll hold you there brother and set you straight
I wont make believe that love is frail and willing to break.

I will come back here,
Bring me back when I'm old.
I want to lay here forever in the cold.
I might be cold but I'm just skin and bones
And I never love England more than when covered in snow.

I wrote my name in your book,
Only god knows why,
And I bet you that he cracked a smile,
And I'm clearing all the stuff out of my room,
Trying desperately to figure out what it is that makes me blue,
And I wrote an epic letter to you,
But it's 22 pages front and back and it's too good to be used
And I tried to be a girl who likes to be used
I'm too good for that.
There's a mind under this hat,
And I called them all and told them I've got to move.

Feel like running
Feel like running,
Running off.
And we will keep you
We will keep you little one,
Safe from harm,
Like an extra arm you are part of us.

You were so smart then
In your jacket and coat
And my softest red scarf was warming your throat.
Winter will leave us,
Left the end of my nose,
So goodbye old England 'till next years snow.
