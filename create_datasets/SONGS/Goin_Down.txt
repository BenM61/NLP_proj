How come I didn't see, you were making fun of me?
How dare you change the rules, you made me look a fool
Well now you're gonna see, the last laugh's not on me
What am I gonna do, to get my revenge on you?
You're goin' down! Goin' down
Was it just another line, or did I misread the sign?
What else could I do, I was so into you
With all this bad luck I've had, my karma must be bad
You've played our little game, oh what a shame
You're goin' down! Goin' down! Goin' down

I'm singing it loud
And I don't care
I'm singing it proud everywhere

Now I feel no remorse, my life is back on course
From this little hitch, I have become a super-bitch
But don't be afraid, by that confession I've made
I am not a whore, I have gone hard-core
You're goin' down! Goin' down! Goin' down! Goin' down

I'm singing it loud
And I don't care
I'm singing it proud everywhere

I'm singing it loud
And I don't care
I'm singing it proud everywhere

Ha, ha, ha! You're goin' down! Goin' down
You're goin' down, goin' down, ha yeah
