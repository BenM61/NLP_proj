Dark-eyed woman on a hot summer's night
Dark-eyed woman are you burning tonight?
Dark-eyed woman won't you step in the light
And tell me dark-eyed woman are you burning tonight
Tonight

Dark-eyed woman it's a quarter to four
I hear your voice
Like a child at my door
Dark-eyed woman I could love you once more
But dark-eyed woman we've both been there before
Before

Dark-eyed woman on a hot summer's night
Dark-eyed woman are you burning tonight?
Dark-eyed woman won't you step in the light
And tell me dark-eyed woman are you burning tonight
Tonight
