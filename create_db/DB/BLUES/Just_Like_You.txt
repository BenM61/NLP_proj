Hello my friend, it's been awhile
All our old clothes are back in style
We went our separate ways only to return
To face a lesson we failed to learn

We didn't understand the truth
We were blinded by the eyes of youth
But time kept on moving and a change has come
And you think that I don't know where you're coming from

Well I feel just like you
And I cry just like you
But I heal just like you
And under my skin I'm just like you

You gave your love and your innocence
And they took away your confidence
Well I'm not those women and I'm not those men
Put your arms around me, I am your friend

'Cause I feel just like you
And I cry just like you
But I heal just like you
And under my skin I'm just like

You and everybody else
When I get hurt I cry for help
And I've got secrets that God only knows
And God knows

I feel just like you
And I cry just like you
I heal just like you
And I breakdown just like you

I feel just like you
And I cry just like you
But I heal just like you
And under my skin I'm just like you
