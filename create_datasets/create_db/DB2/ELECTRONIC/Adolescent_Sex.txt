With the sidewalks trading love 
As subway lights grow brighter 
We're just another hype 
But the pressure's getting harder 
(Get up, get up, get up take it much higher) 

All lover's etiquette 
Make love on first impression 
And adolescent sex with juvenile intentions 
(Get up, get up, get up take it much higher) 

Whatever gets you through the night 
Just keep on dancing 
Whatever gets you through the night 
Just keep on dancing babe 

Well the lady buys a thrill 
Excitement in succession 
But a heartache won't partake 
In articulate obsession 
Well pretty things at rest 
No courtesy surprising 
For love is heaven blessed 
All catastrophes denying 
(get up, get up, get up take it much higher) 

Whatever gets you through the night 
Just keep on dancing 
Whatever gets you through the night 
Just keep on dancing babe 

Well you're out on the street 
With your lover's infections 
Count impossibilities by limination 
And your body still damp 
From your one-room apartment 
And your heartache reminds me 
Love's ?? any doubt 
You submerge again, emerge again 
Just get out the strain
