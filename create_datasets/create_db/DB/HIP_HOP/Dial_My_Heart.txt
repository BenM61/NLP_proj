I wanna put my arms around you
And feel you, dear
Girl, you've touched my heart, I'm so in love
And you're the only girl I'm thinking of, ooh
I call my baby on the phone
Got to get a message just to let her know
That if she ever feels alone to
Dial my heart
And if by chance you're not at home
You can reach me, baby, by the nearest pay phone
I gotta cross my fingers and pray you'll know to
Dial my heart

Dial my heart
Just dial heart
Yeah, yeah

Can we talk it about, baby
Do you have the time
I said am I the only homeboy
That's on your mind, woo
'Cause I'm alone
And I can't sleep at night
And I won't sleep
Until you're by my side, yeah
