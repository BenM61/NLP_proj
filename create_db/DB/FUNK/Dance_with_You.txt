[J-Boog (B2K):] Uh, yo, sing it, uh
[Solange:] Doo doo too too too too

[Verse 1 - Solange]
I've been watching from across the room,
Thinking how I want to dance with you.
See you moving on the dance floor,
Makes me want to dance with you even more.
I like your style, you're so confident,
All the haters call you "arrogant".
I don't care if what they say is true,
'Cause all I want to do is dance with you.

[Chorus - Solange (Solange)]
I see you checking me
And I'm looking at you so
No matter who approaches first (no matter)
Just make a move 'cause (make a move)
On the floor you got it,
I got it to
I want to dance, with you
Dance, with you.

[Verse 2 - Omarion (B2K)]
Girl it's funny you are Feelin' me
'Cause in my mind I'm thinking the same thing.
How I want to move and dance with you
To intimidated to approach you.
I like your vibe, so baby girl what's up
All the chickens heads claim that you're stuck up.
I don't care if what they say is true,
'Cause all I want to do is dance with you.

[Chorus - Solange (Omarion)]
I see you checking me (checking)
And I'm looking at you so (at you)
No matter who approaches first
Just make a move 'cause
On the floor you got it, (you got it)
I got it to
I want to dance (dance), with you
Dance, with you. (with you)

[J-Boog:] Uh, yeah.
Da da da da da da da
What, Solange, yeah.
Solange: You're trying, you're trying.
J-Boog: Dance with me, see'mon

[Rap - Lil Fizz (B2K)]
It's the same little cats who came to rock your world
I'ts amazing what I do to this little girl.
Got them leaving their boyfriends the talk around school
You ain't never met a 15 year old guy this cool.
Come on ma roll with me I'll make your life better
Not pressuring you I know you want to claim this
Poked in the party ma singing off key.
Oh, off key

[Solange:] Make a move!

[Chorus - Solange (with ad-libs from Solange, Omarion and J-Boog)]
I see you checking me
And I'm looking at you so
No matter who approaches first
Just make a move 'cause
On the floor you got it,
I got it to
I want to dance, with you
Dance, with you.

I see you checking me
And I'm looking at you so
No matter who approaches first
Just make a move 'cause
On the floor you got it,
I got it to
I want to dance, with you
Dance, with you.
