I find it looks the same, but everything has changed
I find remembering gets harder every day
Sometimes I still believe who I pretend to be
Sometimes, well everything's exactly how it seems

I see the color of your eyes turn to gray
I feel the wind is growing colder every day
Sometimes I open up the walls and disappear
Sometimes the crashing of the waves is all I hear

Ocean, help me find a way
Ocean, wash us all away

I know that everything we did will come around
I take the thought of you and burn it to the ground
Sometimes I'm waiting for this ice age to arrive
Sometimes the hate in me is keeping me alive

Ocean, help me find a way
Ocean, wash us all away
Ocean, help me find a way
Ocean, carry us away
