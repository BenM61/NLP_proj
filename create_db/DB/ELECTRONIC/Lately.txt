Sometimes all the moments
That we savored for the last
Get crushed between the good and bad
From pressures we have had
But you know I can't conceive the day
When feelings run too high
To work out all the stale terrain
Emotions try to hide
When I try
Lately I can't seem to
Color what we've lost
It all seems like bad means
When lovers turn from lust
Then I try
Try to smoke alone
These shattered ties no compromise
Fall through the fragile hell
You see the drinks stay sipped
'Cause we've lost our grip
Too exhausted to rebel
I try
Lately I can't seem to
Color what we've lost
It all seems like bad means
When lovers turn from lust
Then I try
Then I try
Lately I can't seem to
Color what we've lost
It all seems like bad means
When lovers turn from lust
Lately I can't seem to
Color what we've lost
It all seems like bad means
When lovers when lovers turn from lust
Then I try
Try to smoke alone
