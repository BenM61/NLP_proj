Hey, we're gonna be around
Hey, we're gonna work it out
Hey, there's nothing to fight about
Today we're gonna be around 

You hardly know me, you say I'm your best friend
Everything's ace, it'll work out in the end
Say that you love us, I don't believe
That you want me to stay
You're hoping I'll go away 

Hey, I'm gonna be around
Hey, I'm gonna work it out
Hey, there's plenty to fight about
No way I'm ever going down 

You hardly know me, you say I'm your best friend
Everything's ace, it'll work out in the end
Say that you love us, I don't believe
That you want me to stay
You're hoping I'll go away 

You follow me here, follow me there
You mess me around like you think that I care
You think that I need you, you think that you know me
You can tell me all the things you want to say
'Cause I'll get better anyway 

Follow me here, Follow me there
Mess me around like you think that I care 
Mess me around like you think that I care
Mess me around like you think that I care
You think that I need you, think that you own me
Don't think I see ya, don't think you know me 

Follow me here, Follow me there
Mess me around like you think that I care 

Hey, I'm gonna be around
Hey, I'm gonna work it out
Hey, there's plenty to fight about
Today were gonna be around,
Hey
