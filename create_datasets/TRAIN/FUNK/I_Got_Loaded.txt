I dropped into a tavern where I saw some friends of mine
The party was gettin' underway and the truth was really flyin'

And I got loaded
I got loaded
I got loaded man, I sure got high

I told my pretty baby that I wouldn't stay out no more
You know every time I tried to leave I fell down on the floor

I got loaded
I got loaded
I got loaded man, I sure got high

It made me feel so happy baby, while it was goin' down
I took a sip every trip that bottle went around

And I got loaded
I got loaded
I got loaded man, I sure got high

Last thing I remember, I heard somebody say
Doggone my soul, let's really roll until the break of day

I got loaded
I got loaded
I got loaded man, I sure got high

If you see my baby, please tell her this from me
I didn't mean to stay so long, but the drinks down there were free!

I got loaded
I got loaded
I got loaded man, I sure got high
