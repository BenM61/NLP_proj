(Justin Hayward) I'm up to the eyes and I love ev'ryone Today I could cry I could reach for the sun I travel the sky but for what I don't care I'm walking on air 'n' I'm here 'n' I'm there Fly me straight and fly me high Fly me straight and fly me high I'm driving along with no wheels on the ground Hang on to me tight 'cause it doesn't last long I'm up 'n' I'm down 'n' I'm gone, I'm around A few hours more and it'll be gone Fly me straight and fly me high Fly me straight and fly me high I leave you behind on the streets in the gloom I'm up here alone and there's plenty of room You won't see me, I'll see you, I'm too fast Fly me straight and fly me high Whoops! Here I come, Now I'm gone. Now I'm past Fly me straight and fly me high Today I could cry I could reach for the sun I'm up to the eyes and I love ev'ryone I'm walking on air 'n' I'm here 'n' I'm there I travel the sky but for what I don't care Fly me straight and fly me high Fly me straight and fly me high *************************************************************
