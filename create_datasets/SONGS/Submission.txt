I'm on a submarine mission for you baby
Feel the way you were going
Picked you up on my TV screen
I feel your undercurrent flowing

Submission
Going down down, dragging her down
Submission
I can't tell you what I found

You've got me pretty deep baby
Can't figure out your watery love
Got to solve your mystery
You're sitting it out in heaven above

Submission
Going down down, dragging her down
Submission
I can't tell you what I found

Well, it's a mystery under the sea
Under the water it's me

Submission
Going down down, dragging her down
Submission
I can't tell you what I found

I'm on a submarine mission for you baby
Feel the way you were going
Picked you up on my TV screen
I feel your undercurrent flowing

Submission
Going down down dragging her down
Submission
I can't tell you what I found
