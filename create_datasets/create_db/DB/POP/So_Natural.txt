It's so natural the way you touch me
So natural the way you run your fingers through my hair
It's so natural the way you make me feel like I'm a lady
It's so natural the way you care
It's so natural

When I feel low. you pull me higher
You warm me up, set me on fire
Well there's no way in this world
I could ever be without you

You come home, and I am waiting for you
To come over and give me hungry kisses
Of love, of love, so true
And there's no way in this world
I could ever be without you

It's so natural the way you touch me
So natural the way you run your fingers through my hair
It's so natural the way you make me feel like I'm a lady
It's so natural the way you care
It's so natural

With hands so warm, you touch my very soul
You pull me closer, so I won't feel the cold
Just love, love, your love, so true
And there's no way in this world
I could ever be without you

Swimming in the love you give me
It's so natural
