Somebody else is taking my place,
Somebody else now shares your embrace;
While I am trying to keep from crying,
You go around with a smile on your face.

Little you know the price I have paid,
Little you care for vows that you made;
My heart is aching, soon will be breaking,
For somebody's taking my place.
