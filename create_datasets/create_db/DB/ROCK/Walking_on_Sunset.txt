Watching all the people
Like the waves along the shore
They hang around he whiskey
And every open store

I'm walking on sunset
And I'll never reach the end
I'm walking on sunset
Everything is like a friend

All the pretty women
Never seen a better crop
Music all around
The flashing lights will never stop

I'm walking on sunset
And I'll never reach the end
I'm walking on sunset
Everything is like a friend

Well standing at the corner
Watching every kind of car
Friendly people come and say
They wanna see your star

I'm walking on sunset
And I'll never reach the end
I'm walking on sunset
Everything is like a friend

The cops were in the cars
But they never bothered me
A new magic world
I never felt so free

Well I'm walking on sunset
And I'll never reach the end
Well I'm walking on sunset
Everything is like a friend
