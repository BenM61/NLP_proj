Below these planetarium skies
I run towards you
The horizontal bunjy pulls me back
Though I adore you

They say that we will never know it
Unless we surrender to it
There are signs everywhere
Telling me that planet Earth
Is just one big trip

But I'm held hostage in a dream
Held hostage in a sleep
Following a shadow of a shadow
Held hostage in a dream
Following a shadow of a shadow

Have I ever truly loved
Does the rain and sun sprout seeds of stealth
I'm waiting patiently for the day
When I let the world turn by itself
Till the moment when I'm dancing
Like no-ones watching

You shouldn't depend on me
I see it differently
But I'm always grateful
When another soul believes in me

But I'm held hostage in a dream
Held hostage in a sleep
Following a shadow of a shadow
Held hostage in a dream
Following a shadow of a shadow

But I'm held hostage in a dream
Held hostage in a sleep
Following a shadow of a shadow
Held hostage in a dream
Following a shadow of a shadow

But I'm held hostage in a dream
Held hostage in a sleep
Following a shadow of a shadow
Held hostage in a dream
Following a shadow of a shadow
