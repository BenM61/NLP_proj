i lost my heart in san francisco years ago 
i've been back to search but the curse is getting worse 
don't you know 
that the hardest blow to take is the one that you don't 
really know is around the corner and ready to floor 
you it looms and it goads 
and we'll find some piece of mind from the shadows 
and i know that we could climb just to pass the time 
like the heroes who stand up in their prime 
lost but still they shine 

i was solo and alfresco years ago 
and i fan the flames that keep me burning don't you know 
that i'm finding it harder still climbing up to this hill 
without you clinging on don't open the wounds that 
scarred you it just makes things harder to prove 
where you're from 

heroes misunderstood
