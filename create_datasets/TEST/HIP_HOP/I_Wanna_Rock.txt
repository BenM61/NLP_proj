G Mix! I was a fiend, before I became a teen
I melted cabbage sacks instead of cones of ice cream
Crime orientated that's how the west was originated
Fitted like pieces of puzzle, complicated
I dropped the sack and tried to rap hits y'all
They tried to bang on me, and say that I'm too small
Cool! Cause I don't get upset
I call the king of the east catch a flight then I jet
Right back to the west, where my niggas is at
Scoop the gilly put it back on the map
Like this like that while you rollin' a bag
Loadin' ya gat, pop pop, I'm holdin' ya back
I'm like the Whopper f*ck the big mack!
Run up on the dog my gat go click clack
And that's fo' sho! 
The reason why, man I don't know so let's go 'cause

(It Takes Two)
I wanna rock right now, rock-rock-right now (Snoop! Dogg!)
I wanna rock right now, rock-rock-right now (Snoop! Dogg! Snoop! Dogg!)
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!) I wanna rock right now, rock-rock-right now)
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!) I wanna rock right now, rock-rock-right now)

Boss Dogg chillin', lookin' like a million
Yeah, nigga got it, I'ma leave it to my chil'ren
Tonight I'm on some other shit, and baby lovin' it
Hella fast, grip dey ass like the oven mitt
I'm gooned up, boy! Rich as f*ck, boy!
Black and gold brakes, that's my truck, boy
I'm on my Eastside, shit I'm workin'
I got the party goin, and it's jerkin
My niggas all long, we rollin' out deck
Hoes gettin' in, you betta' pick a bitch
'Cause when I shut it down, the party's over wit
She call me Superman, I'm on my (Soulja) shit (You!)
Boss Dogg, get 'em, I sick 'em and take 'em home
West Coast bitch, I'm on my fuckin throne
I'm giggin' on these hoes, do 'em like dominoes
And slam 'em on they back, and tell 'em vamanos

(It takes two)
I wanna rock right now, rock-rock-right now (Snoop! Dogg!)
I wanna rock right now, rock-rock-right now (Snoop! Dogg! Snoop! Dogg!)
