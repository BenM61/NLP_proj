Magic, magic, magic, magic
This magic moment, so different and so new
Was like any other until I kissed you
And then it happened, it took me by surprise
I knew that you felt it too, by the look in your eyes

Sweeter than wine
Softer than the summer night
Everything I want, I have
Whenever I hold you tight

This magic moment while your lips are close to mine
Will last forever, forever till the end of time

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (magic, magic, magic, magic)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (magic, magic, magic, magic)
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh (magic, magic, magic, magic)

Sweeter than wine
Softer than the summer night
Everything I want, I have
Whenever I hold you tight

This magic moment while your lips are close to mine
Will last forever, forever till the end of time

Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh (magic, magic, magic, magic)
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh (magic, magic, magic, magic)
Magic moment (magic, magic, magic, magic)
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh (magic, magic, magic, magic)
Magic moment
