Don't you know that I want to be more than just your friend 
Holdin' hands is fine, but I've got better things on my mind 
You know it could happen if you'd only see me in a different light 
Maybe when we finally get together, you will see that I was right 

Say you love me 
You know that it could be nice 
If you'd only say you love me 
Don't treat me like I was lice, ooh, woo, woo 

Please love me 
I'll be yours and you'll be mine 
If you'd only say you love me, baby 
Things would really work out fine
