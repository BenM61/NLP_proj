Go jump in the lake  go ride up the hill 
Get out of this house 
It's a house of your making  it's a house of ill will 
Get out of this house 
Go listen to Buddha  go listen to Joe 
Get out of this house 
If anyone asks  you tell them you don't know 
Get out of this house 

I spent eleven long years in a hot house zone 
I spent twenty nine more trying to get home 
Well I never got home  but I did what I did 
And I got myself this house and you can't come in 

I'm the queen of my castle, I'm the king of my room 
Get out of this house 
I got more than I need, more than I ever could use 
Get out of this house 

I spent seventeen years trying to save my soul 
I spent twenty three more down in the hole 
Now my soul is alright but I might get found out 
I got myself this house now and I can't get out 

If I see you again it will be in my head at the end of a cloud 
If you see me again it will be in your head telling you to get out 

You act like a baby, you talk like a fool 
Get out of this house 
Go back to your mama, go back to high school 
Get out of this house 

Go jump in the lake, go jump out the door 
Get out of this house 
I've had all I can stand and I can't stand no more 
Get out of this house 
Get out of this house
