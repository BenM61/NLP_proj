[Repeat: x2]
311 311 311 (what's up)
Believer (what's up) 
Believer (what's up)

In a minute, everything you have can all be straight gone
In a minute, things you thought were tied can come straight undone
How about some knocks on wood, some so far, it's so good, any day
What you think is solid earth can jump up and spread out
To the north and south, that's what plates are about
Nature has no conscience, no kindness, or ill will

But the dreams they had make me sad because of the vibes of them
When one girl dreamt a fire in hers and then it happened
To me and my family, my bros and I were driving The RV bleeding flames, us leaping through fire, surviving
Zoned with no home, there was fire all on it
Umm, let me have my life, I want it

(I'm gonna.) [Repeat: x4]
I'm gonna let you know that I said
We're comin' in kill, we're comin' in chill
We're comin' in how we will
Gone to tell the whole world what's the deal
And I say know no critical border 'cause
We do what we want
Got more funky styles that my laser jet got font 

[Chorus:]
Not one to get over sounding like the norm Friendly to the radio, all that shit is corn
All we coming with is a little bit of swing
And we go on like it ain't no thing
Omaha Stylee, did not think there was one
Where you know the radio's weak and the shows are more fun 
But you know we f*ck up the dancehall since 1988
Many did not think when they hear that we come from this state
Still we're down like that x3
Makin' the funk that smells of skunk

Omaha Stylee, did not think there was one
Where you know the radio's weak and the shows are more fun
But you know we f*ck up the dancehall since 1988
Many did not think when they hear that we come from this state
The dance hall that we come from was a pool table basement
The fun was low key, and the records were, too, major fun

Such occasions occur back in the day
It begins, you're a raw kid all the way
Son of a gun, but there you drifted
All are endowed but few are gifted
At the break of dawn behaving like a spy
Lampin' in the light the cold world awakens
Deeper is the light to open up the sky
Look into my eyes and see them dilatin'
Omaha Stylee is the shit we come with, man
Embedded in our souls, it breathes out from this band
We always knew that we could
Thank you if you, too, felt we would 

We will arise, explore these worlds and find the grassroots
How to crew to do the grinding of the grounds to brew
My dude, on the one, come off like Teflon
Rock your shit and you will rise on  If you're a farmer out standing in your field say (uh)
Do as you will do as you wish follow your bliss say (uh)
We travel 'round the country, giving it our best 
We like to see the people dancing and bouncing and the rest
The hammer and the chisel and the rule and conquest
We forged the sword, the chariots of war, our battle axe 
There's much power in anger, but love's a bigger banger 
Complete props to my crew
'Cause this is how we do
Omaha Stylee
