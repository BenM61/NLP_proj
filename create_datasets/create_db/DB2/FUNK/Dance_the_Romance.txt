I hear you imagine
You're losing it all,
Your mind's in confusion
Your back's to the wall
Hold on! there is a door and it's opening.

The light in the tunnel
Deceived you again,
It was only the headlight
From the oncoming train

Hold on! there is an answer to everything,
Hold on! don't let their attitude worry you.
Hold on! they only want to discourage you
Hold on! trust in the rhythm inside of you
Hold on! dance the romance
And your heartbeat will show you the way.

There's no point in crying
For things that are gone
Tomorrow is waiting
With its different song
Hold on!
There is nobody but you who can bar the way

You've got to keep fighting
It's true what they say
It's them or it's you girl
There's no easy way.
Hold on! dance the romance
And your heartbeat will show you the way
