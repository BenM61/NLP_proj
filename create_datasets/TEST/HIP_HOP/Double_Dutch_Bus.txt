Gimme a "ho" if you got your funky bus fare

Ho! ho! ho!

There's a double dutch bus coming down the street
Moving pretty fast
So kinda shuffle your feet
Get on the bus and pay your fare
And tell the driver that you're
Going to a Double Dutch Affair
Fe fi fo fum
Well I'll be darn here it comes
The Double Dutch Bus is on the street
You'd better get off the curb
Move your feet

Bus fare trans-pass
That's the way my money lasts
Ain't got no car to get around
When I go to work I've gotta go downtown
Now I've missed my train
That's a darn shame
When I'm running late no sleep's to blame
If you've gotta wife you know I'm right
Gotta special man well I can understand
Uptown, downtown everybody's getting down
Say uptown, say downtown
Well I missed my bus I know I'm late
I gotta do something I know I hate
I'm gonna walk to work fifteen blocks
I already got a hole in my socks
Go ahead and laugh that's okay
'Cause what I really wanna say
I got bad feet my corns hurt
To top it off I'm late for work
Let me tell you what I say
When I'm dealin' wit a funky sidewalk
Let me show you how I walk
When I gotta do my funky walk
Let me tell you what I say
When I'm dealing wit a funky sidewalk
I say shhhhhhhhhhh-sugarrrrr
