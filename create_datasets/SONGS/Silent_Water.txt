A cold wind blow
Baby
Across my heart

And a heart of a clown
Oh
Just break apart.
Step inside
Love will keep you warm

Or a river to cross
You did it with you charm.
Oh
Come send me an angel
Oh
Come send me some love

It's hard and I feel it when I fall in love.
Silent water nights of heartache
Silent water full of tears

I'm a man with broken heart
Babe
I'm lost in pain and fears.
Silent water where we start
Babe
Silent water full of pride

'Til the ocean in my heart
Babe
Alone
Oh
I have cried.

I saw you in my world
Baby
Chooses for love

While a love is all
No mountain is high enough.
We restin'
Baby
We can't go on

Just take my hand in the lights of dawn.
Come send me an angel
Oh
Come send me some love

It's more than a feeling when I fall in love.
Silent water nights of heartache
Silent water full of tears
