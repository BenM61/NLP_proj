O no, no
I know you think it ain't my place
To say how I feel
But I'm gonna say it anyway
'Cause I gotta keep it real
I know you're tired of trying to make it be
Something that's truly not (truly not)
Girl, it kills me everyday to see you in tears
And it amazes me the way you put up all these years
You be tweaking, tryin' a make it work, but you keepin' in a hurt
Oh baby, listen to me

You don't have to wait
I can ease your pain
You don't have to be left out in the rain
Don't just say you're fed up, tired of love
Whatever you need, I got it; come with me
You don't have to stay up waiting by the phone
You don't have to ever feel like you're alone
Don't just say you're fed up, tired of love
Whatever you need, I got it; come with me

You're the type that always said
You don't need a man who's gonna make your heart stop over and again
And now you're telling me that you're okay
But you don't realize you're getting more pain than gain
And I ain't never been the kind to steer you wrong
If you trust me as a friend, then trust me with your heart
Girl, (trust me)
It don't take a lot to understand
You need yourself another man

You don't have to wait
I can ease your pain
You don't have to be left out in the rain
Don't just say you're fed up, tired of love
Whatever you need, I got it; come with me
You don't have to stay up waiting by the phone
You don't have to ever feel like you're alone
Don't just say you're fed up, tired of love
Whatever you need, I got it; come with me

Don't give up, girl
Don't give up, girl
Don't give up, girl
You don't have to do it, baby

Don't give up, girl
Don't give up, girl
Don't give up, girl
You don't have to do it, baby

Don't give up, girl
Don't give up, girl
Don't give up, girl
You don't have to do it, baby

Don't give up, girl
Don't give up, girl
Don't give up, girl
You don't have to do it, baby

You don't have to wait
I can ease your pain
You don't have to be left out in the rain
Don't just say you're fed up, tired of love
Whatever you need, I got it; come with me
You don't have to stay up waiting by the phone
You don't have to ever feel like you're alone
Don't just say you're fed up, tired of love
Whatever you need, I got it; come with me

Aw, baby
Don't give up on love, shorty
Because I'm here
I'm here
