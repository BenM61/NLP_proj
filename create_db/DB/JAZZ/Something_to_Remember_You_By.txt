Oh, give me something to remember you by
When you are far away from me, dear
Some little something, meaning love can not die,
No matter where you chance to be.

Though I'll pray for you, night and day for you;
It will see me through like a charm,
Till you're returning.
So give me something to remember you by
When you are far away from me.

Though I'll pray for you, night and day for you

It will see me through like a charm
Till your returning

So give me something to remember you by
When you are far away from me.
