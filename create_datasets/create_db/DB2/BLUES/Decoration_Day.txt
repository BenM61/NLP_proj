Peoples, I had a woman
She was nice and kind to me in every way
Peoples, I had a woman
She was nice and kind to me in every way
Lord, she died; she left me
I sing the blues on every Decoration Day

Lord, I was standin' around my baby's bedside
When my Lord taken my baby away
Lord, I was standin' around my baby's beside
When my Lord taken my baby away
Well, well, when it hurt so doggone bad
Lord, I hung my head an cried

"Yes, so sorry"
She said, "Daddy, please, don't worry
'Cause everybody's got to go
Daddy, please, don't worry
'Cause everybody's got to go"

Well, well, well, well
Lord, the best woman
God knows I ever had
All this hurtin'
I just hung my head an cried

Yes, it was a sad day with me
So sad that day
So sad that day
When my Lord taken my baby away
Well, well, well, I'll meet my baby
On some old lonesome day
