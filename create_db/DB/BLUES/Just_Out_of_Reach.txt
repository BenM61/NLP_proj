A love that runs away from me
Dreams that just won't let me be
Blues that keeps on bothering me
Chains that just won't set me free
So far away from you and all your charm
Just out of reach of my two empty arms

Each night in dreams I see your face
Memories and time cannot erase
Then I awake and find you're gone
Then I'm so blue and all alone
So far away from you so sweet and warm
Just out of reach of my two empty arms

That lonesome feeling all the time
Knowing you could not be mine
Dreams that hurt me in my sleep
Vows that we could never keep

So far away from you and all your charm
Just out of reach of my two empty arms, Empty arms
