Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want

If you want me to love you
If you want me to hug you
Tell me what you want

If you want me to squeeze you
If you want me to please you
Tell me what you want, oh

I seen you walking home
On my way home from school
You got to glance at me
You think you're acting cool

My friends have told me
That you wanna know my name
Let's stop this peek-a-boo
Come clean and state your game, oh no no

I'm not really sure
If I should love you, baby
You keep coming back for more
You're driving me crazy

Should I hug you?
Should I love you?
Should I please you?
Should I squeeze you?

Tell me what you want
I ain't psychic, I can't read your mind, oh baby
Tell me what you want
'Cause I ain't psychic, I can't read your mind

Every night I dream of being by your side
And (Incomprehensible)
I feel so lost 'cause I wish I was your guy
Give me a chance, I wanna try love again

Quit playing games with me
Lovin? don't come free
I'll dry my eyes
And listen to your sweet talking lies

Ohh don't you that I'm not telling lies
Maybe you've gone crazy
You took me by surprise
Please believe me, baby

Should I tell you
When I want you?
That I'm always
Thinking of you

Tell me what you want
I ain't psychic, I can't read your mind, oh
Tell me what you want
Darling, won't you tell me what you want, baby

Tell me what you want
'Cause I ain't psychic, I can't read your mind
Tell me what you want
Why don't you tell me what you want, baby
Right now

Oh baby, tell me what you want
'Cause I ain't psychic, I can't read your mind, no
Tell me what you want, no

Tell me what you want
'Cause I ain't psychic, I can't read your mind, no
Tell me what you want
No, can't you give it to me, girl

Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want

Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want
Tell me
