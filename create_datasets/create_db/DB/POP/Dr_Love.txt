Callin' callin' Doctor Love
Callin' callin' Doctor Love
Mamma shouldn't 'a' called you
To come and treat me good

For the reason for my fever she never understood
But I've always had a weakness for a man in uniform
And when you took my heart beats boy you turned me or
You said that I was better

And nothing was the matter with me.
Doctor Love please come running
Can't you see I'm in pain
You've broken my heart and you should be ashamed

Doctor Love please come running
Can't you see I'm in pain
My pulse is getting weaker please come back again.
Temperature is rising

So you bring round a bottle of pills
But doctor can't you see it's my heart that's really ill
So put away your medicine and your special therapy
'Cause the reason for my fever is very fond of me

You said that I was better
And nothing was the matter with me.
Doctor Love please come running
