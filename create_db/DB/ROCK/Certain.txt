I was certain you'd always love me I was certain you'd never change
I gave my love to you completely I felt so certain of everything
(But now you're gone you're gone) and that's for certain
(I'm all alone all alone) and can't quit hurtin'
You're still the only one I'm livin' for
Seems that's all I know for certain anymore
(But now you're gone you're gone) and that's for certain
(I'm all alone all alone) and can't quit hurtin'
Life won't ever be the way it was before
Seems that's all I know for certain anymore
