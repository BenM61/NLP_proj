I want to hug you
And kiss you
And squeeze you
Till my arms fall

And, baby, by that
You know
I love you so

Just come walk a little closer, baby
Let me show you what I mean

I want to hug you
And kiss you
And squeeze you
Till my arms fall off

You give so much trouble, baby
You drive me out of my mind

I want to hug you
And kiss you
And squeeze you
Till my arms fall off

And, baby, by that
You know
I love you so
