Tell you like it is with the kiss
Baby when it drips from your lips
Tell you like it is, it's like this
Don't be such a slave to your brother

Baby get shaky after school
Ooh oh there you oh oh there you
Baby go crazy, break the rules
Ooh oh there you oh oh there you go
Go go go go
Oh oh there you go
Oh oh there you go

Baby get shaky after school
Oh oh there you oh oh there you
Baby go crazy, break the rules
Oh oh there you oh oh there you go
Go go go go

Oh oh there you go
Baby get shaky after school
Oh oh there you oh oh there you
Baby go crazy, break the rules
Oh oh there you oh oh there you go

Baby get shaky after school
Baby go crazy, break the rules
Oh oh there you oh oh there you go

Tell you like it is with the kiss
I can see the swing of your hips
Tell you like it is, it's like this
Where you involve a trick from your brother

You can say what you want
But you're so
Get outta here
You can say but you don't
Such a shame, let it go
Get outta here

Baby get shaky after school
Oh oh there you oh oh there you
Baby go crazy, break the rules
Oh oh there you oh oh there you go

Baby get shaky after school
Baby go crazy, break the rules
Ooh oh there you ooh oh there you go
Go go go go

Baby get shaky after school
Oh oh there you oh oh there you
Baby go crazy, break the rules
Oh oh there you oh oh there you go
Go go go go
