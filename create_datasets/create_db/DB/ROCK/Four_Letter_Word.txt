Sleepwalk away your life if that turns you on
It's only the moment,
Look away and it's gone
It's about time that your mind took a holiday
You're all grown up,
Don't you ever wanna play?

Ah, you've had enough
Of staring out of deaden eyes
Ah, it's gonna be tough
The battle's on and so is the prize
I don't know what it is I'm feelin'
A four letter word really gets my meaning
Nothing ever lasts
Forever

Get on your feet we're going out of our minds
The wheels need to roll
The clock on the wall said its time
Call in love, call in whatever you please
It's not what you wanted,
It might be just what you need

Ah, you've had enough,
It feels like you've blown a fifty amp fuse,
Ah, it's gonna be tough
The more you have the more you can lose
I don't know what it is I'm feelin'
A four letter word really gets my meaning
Nothing ever lasts
Forever

Ah, you've had enough
Of staring out of deaden eyes
Ah, it's gonna be tough
The battle's on and so is the prize
I don't know what it is I'm feelin'
A four letter word really get's my meaning
Nothing ever lasts
Forever

And nothing ever lasts forever
Nothing ever lasts forever
Nothing ever lasts forever
