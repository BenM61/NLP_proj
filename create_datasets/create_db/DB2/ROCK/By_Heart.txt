Girl, they ain't no way out
When something is meant to be
Darling, there ain't no doubt
I'm right where I want to be

So everything you see as the end of our road
I see as only a start
This ain't no time to stop before we begin
And though there's no promises

Everytime I think how good it could be
I start to be believe it's up to the stars
I should use my head
But that only tends to lose me and confuse me
Everytime I think how good it could be
I surely believe we'll make it that far
I should use my head
But I only know you by heart, by heart

Girl, I know I'm in
Over my head
But now I need to find out
Just what you want from me
And if I'm reaching too high, you know we live and learn
That's all it takes in this life
I can't be overly cautious where love's concerned
I know there's no promises

Everytime I think how good it could be
I start to be believe it's up to the stars
I should use my head
But that only tends to lose me and confuse me
Everytime I think how good it could be
I surely believe we'll make it that far
I should use my head
But I only know you by heart, by heart
