Hey, you never had your hair this way
Are you still living in that place?
They told me you've been doing okay, okay

In another world where you and me
We show our hearts, yeah, entirely
Deliver me from reality
And take me to my fantasy

Tell me we can make this real
If we can follow what we feel
I'm running but I've reached the edge
And now I'm falling, so promise that you'll catch me
Promise that you'll catch me

Dreams, forever in my head
It seems, I finally know what they mean
I promise that one day you'll see, you'll see

In another world where you and me
We show our hearts, yeah, entirely
Deliver me from reality
And take me to my fantasy

Tell me we can make this real
If we can follow what we feel
I'm running but I've reached the edge
And now I'm falling, so promise that you'll catch me
Promise that you'll catch me

Promise that you'll catch me
