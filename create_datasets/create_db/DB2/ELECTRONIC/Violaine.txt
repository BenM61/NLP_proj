Ik does a dashik dozen
Ik does a yield gig does
Ik does alone cheyenne
Mad at them who tease him scrawling

And I knew deeper darlin
Idiom a deus is dos
Indeared look he loves it
Your elan new sub dearie

Says your supper should shout
As you eat up seisured
Evil oh it will 
Evolve evil vamos a la


He tear them off, he tear them off 
(he tear them off and eat the meal too)
Oh eat off your toe
(as you eat up)
Slow eat that meal, slow eat that meal
(slow eat that meal, no way down) 
No way down, you're close
(chew too slow, you're close)
And how can you mock me
(how can you be in the nude)
When you're my friend
(when you're my friend)
He tear them off, he tear them off
(ik does ...?)
Oh eat off your toe

I know I need to tell you
All I've seen, all i catch
Put in the poster girl
And shake like dogs of tiding scholar
