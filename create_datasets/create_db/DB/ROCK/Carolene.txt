Well hello, Carolene
It's so good just to see you
It's been quite a while
And we both may have changed
But last night I was wondering
If I'm under my track
'Cause I just got to say
Baby I want you back
I want to know
Don't keep me waiting
Don't keep me wondering
Let's do it again
I want to know
Don't Keep me waiting
Don't keep me wondering
Let's do it again
Well hello, Carolene
When you caught me crying
Late in the day
When the light turns to blue
'Cause we lived our love
In those warm afternoons
Oh I know you remember
Won't you please say you do
I want to Know
Don't Keep me waiting
Don't keep me wondering
Let's do it again

(Chorus repeats two more times)
Aaaah, Carolene
Let's do it again
Why Don't you do it again
Aaaah, Carolene
Let's do it again
Why don't we do it again

(The last verse repeats 2 more times)
