Do what you want but you gonna have to do it now!
Say what you want but you gonna have to say it loud!

Running around with the world on your shoulder.
You look around and you're just getting older.
Once you had a beautiful dream.

Follow the sun or you know you're live in the clouds.
Keep your mind one or you know it's gonna hit the ground
Running around with the world on your shoulder.
You look around and you're just getting older.
Once you had a beautiful dream.
(You got a beauitiful dream ah ah)
A beautiful dream
(You got a beautiful dream ah ah)
A beautiful dream
(You got a beautiful dream ah ah)

Running around with your head full of worry
You look around and you've just been in a hurry
Once you had a beatiful dream ah ah ...

Do what you want but you know you gotta do it now!
Kill what you want but you better not kill this town!
Running around with the world on your shoulder.
You look around and you're just getting older.
Once you had a beauitiful dream ...
(You got a beautiful dream ah ah)
A beautiful dream
(You got a beautiful dream ah ah)
A beautiful dream
(You got a beautiful dream ah ah)

Do what you want!
Do what you want!
Do what you want!
Do what you want!
