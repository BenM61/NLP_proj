I got no time for the corner boys
Down the street making all that noise
Don't want to horse on eight avenue
'Cause tonight I want to be with you
Tonight I'm gonna take that ride
Across the river to the Jersey side
Take my baby to the carnival
Well I'll take you on all the rides
Down the shore everything's all right
You're with baby on a Saturday night
Don't you know all my dreams come true
When I'm walking down the street with you

Sing sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la 
When you're in love with a Jersey girl

You know you thrill me with all her charms
When you're wrapped up in your baby's arms
You know you give me everything
I know that some day that you'll wear my ring
Down the shore everything's all right
You're with baby on a Saturday night
You know all my dreams come true
When I'm walking down the street with you

Sing sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la 
When you're in love with a Jersey girl

I call you name your name 
I can't sleep at night

Sing sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la 
When you're in love with a Jersey girl
