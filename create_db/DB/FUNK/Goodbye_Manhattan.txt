Moon and the stars
Honky-tonk cars
Goodbye Manhattan
Can't buy that attitude

I can feel the heat
On the soles of my feet
In the shadows of the sidewalk
In a cool limousine
Driving in between
Cop cars in a crosstalk
Eastside Westside
Take me downtown
I don't want to be alone tonight

And the city never sleeps
She's got a spell on me
So bad I don't want to leave
Goodbye Manhattan
Can't buy that attitude
The moon and the stars
Kiss those honky-tonk cars
That's my Manhattan

There's a room with a view
Down the crowded avenue
But they're begging my attention
When a man in the street
Shot down by a freak
Didn't even get a mention
Eastside Westside
Uptown downtown
Took the money for a taxi ride

And the city never weeps
She can't afford the tears
Too bad I gotta leave
Goodbye Manhattan (goodbye)
Can't buy that attitude
The moon and the stars
Kiss those honky-tonk cars
That's my Manhattan

One more look at you mm mm
Under the light of the moon and the stars
And those honky-tonk cars
Goodbye (goodbye)
Can't buy that attitude
The moon and the stars
Kiss those honky-tonk cars
That's my Manhattan
Goodbye Manhattan

Goodbye Manhattan

Goodbye Manhattan
Goodbye Manhattan oh oh oh
I hate to go
I can feel the heat
From the soles of my feet
In the shadows of my sidewalk
In a cool limousine
Driving in between
Cop cars in a crosstalk
Eastside Westside
Take me downtown
Oh no I don't want to be alone tonight

And the city the city never sleeps
She's got a spell on me
So bad I don't want to leave
Goodbye Manhattan

Goodbye Manhattan
Goodbye Manhattan
