It's the darkest hour
of the darkest night
It's a million miles
from the morning light
Can't get no sleep
Don't know what to do
I've got those midnight blues
When the shadows fall,
I feel the night closing in
There must be some reason
for this mood I'm getting in
Can't get no sleep
Don't know what to do
I've got those midnight blues
Every evening after sundown,
as the light begins to fade
I feel so low, but I just don't know
why these blues won't go away
