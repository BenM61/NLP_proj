You have a natural tendency
To squeeze off a shot
You're good fun at parties
You wear the right masks

You're old but you still
Like a laugh in the locker room
You can't abide change
You're at home on the range

You opened your suitcase
Behind the old workings
To show off the magnum
You deafened the canyon

A comfort a friend
Only upstaged in the end
By the Uzi machine gun
Does the recoil remind you

Remind you of sex
Old man what the hell you gonna kill next
Old timer who you gonna kill next
I looked over Jordan and what did I see

Saw a U.S. Marine in a pile of debris
I swam in your pools
And lay under your palm trees
I looked in the eyes of the Indian

Who lay on the Federal Building steps
And through the range finder over the hill
I saw the front line boys popping their pills
Sick of the mess they find

On their desert stage
And the bravery of being out of range
Yeah the question is vexed
Old man what the hell you gonna kill next

Old timer who you gonna kill next
Hey bartender over here
Two more shots
And two more beers

Sir turn up the TV sound
The war has started on the ground
Just love those laser guided bombs
They're really great

For righting wrongs
You hit the target
And win the game
From bars 3,000 miles away

3,000 miles away
We play the game
With the bravery of being out of range
We zap and maim

With the bravery of being out of range
We strafe the train
With the bravery of being out of range
We gain terrain

With the bravery of being out of range
With the bravery of being out of range
We play the game
With the bravery of being out of range
