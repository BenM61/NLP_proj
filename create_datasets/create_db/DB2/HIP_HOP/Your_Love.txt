Your your your your love
Oh, it's gettin' hot in here (it's gettin' too hot in here)
So turn the lights down low
And lets move our bodies in control
You know what I need sweetie
Take this time and you will succeed
In loving me the way I like it
Your love

Your love is too hot
I can feel your love running through my mind
Nobody loves me you're a one of a kind
Your love
Your love is too hot
Your love

Stop right here, baby (stop)
I can't take it anymore
It's just the way you move
And the way your kisses groove
Love is on the rise
And caress me with surprises
Of your love, love

Bridge:
I love it when you hold me
'Cause you hold me so tight
And I love it when you keep my attention
Sharing love beyond mention

Your love is so right
And I'll never have to look for another
Your love
Your love is so right
Moving all down my spine

Your love is too hot
I can feel your love running through my mind
Nobody loves me you're a one of a kind
Your love
Your love is too hot
Your love

Your love is aggressive but smooth
Takes me flat on my face

I love it when you hold me
'Cause you hold me so tight
And I love it when you keep my attention
Sharing love beyond mention

Your love is so right
I'm convinced
I've got sense
I'll never look for anyone else
It's your love

Your love is so right
Moving all down my spine
You make me want to loose my mind
Your love
Your love
Feels so good I want some more
Your love is so right
I love it when you hold me

Your love is too hot
I can feel your love running through my mind
Nobody loves me you're a one of a kind
Your love
Your love is too hot
Your love

I love it when you hold me
Your love
Your love is so right
