And through the grief and pain, I'm half insane
I give an inch you take a mile
You throw away the key, ignore my plea
You cut me down without a trial
(You keep me hanging by) hanging by a thread
(You keep me hanging by) leaving me for dead
(You keep me hanging by) I heard it when you said, 
(You keep me hanging by) "Keep him hanging by a thread"

You throw a length of rope, I grab, you hope, 
It's just enough to hang myself
I make a fatal slip, I lose my grip
There's no-one left to call for help

(You keep me hanging by) hanging by a thread
(You keep me hanging by) leaving me for dead
(You keep me hanging by) I'm not finished yet
(You keep me hanging by) I'm still hanging by a thread

I hear a final scream, another dream
I hear it then I start to go (hang him by a thread)
I recognise the pain, a time to play
Then stuck me to the afterglow (hang him by a thread)
Then I wake up wet, soaked in sweat
Tell you all you want to know (hang him by a thread)
