Dear catastrophe waitress
Dear catastrophe waitress
I'm sorry that you seem to have the weight of the world over you
I cherish your smile
There's a word of peace on your lips
Say it, and with tenderness I'll cherish you

Dear catastrophe girlfriend
Dear catastrophe girlfriend
I'm sorry if he hit you with a full can of coke
It's no joke
Your face is bleeding
You'll soon be leaving this town to the clowns who worship
No one but themselves
No one but themselves

Dear catastrophe waitress
Dear catastrophe waitress
I'm sorry if the kids hold you in cool disregard
I know it's hard
Stick to what you know
You'll blow them all to the wall
When they realize what you've been working for
You've been working for
You've been working for
