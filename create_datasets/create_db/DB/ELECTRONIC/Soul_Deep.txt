There's something that I wanna keep
Inside my heart where feelings are soul deep
Things could get worse day after day,
I know my dreams would never fade away.

I know you've got soul but you're wasting your time
Looking for our goal you don't need to find
So please change your style and start living for a while
Everything is already there in your heart.

Yeah yeah yeah

It's there when you are asleep
When you heart beats you can hear it soul deep.

Things could get worse day after day
I know my dreams would never fade away

I know you've got soul
But you're wasting your time
Looking for our goal
You don't need to find
No need to find
So please change your style
And start thinking for a while
Everything is already there in your heart.

Yeah

I only want you to try something new
I only want you to believe in you
That's what you have to do.
Trust me, it's true.

That's what you have to do.
La la la la la la la
That's what you have to do.

There's something that I wanna keep
Inside my heart where feelings are soul deep.

I know you've got soul
But you're wasting your time

Soul deep, something I wanna keep.
