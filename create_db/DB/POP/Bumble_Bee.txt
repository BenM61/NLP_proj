I'm gonna have to put you down
You've been treatin' me like a clown
You know you've hurt me once before
You'll never hurt me anymore

Shoo-wee, you hurt me like a bee
A bumble bee, an evil bumble bee

I gave you love as sweet as honey
My life, my soul and all my money
You didn't seem to realize
You had a home in paradise

Shoo-wee, you hurt me like a bee
A bumble bee, an evil bumble bee

Don't you know I cry
Night after night
Just one kiss before you go
Don't ever come back no more

Now baby there's no need of cryin'
I'm sick and tired of all your lyin'
You know you've hurt my heart again
I'm sorry baby it's the end

Shoo-wee, you hurt me like a bee
A bumble bee, an evil bumble bee

Don't you know I cry
Night after night
Just one kiss before you go
Don't ever come back no more

Now baby there's no need of cryin'
I'm sick and tired of all your lyin'
You know you've hurt my heart again
I'm sorry baby it's the end

Shoo-wee, you hurt me like a bee
A bumble bee, an evil bumble bee
