Here comes that big let down
It anchors your soul
In sadness she left you
Holding your own

Where's the love that binds us?
Not this time
Where lies the true forgiveness?
Not this time

Where's the love that binds us?
Not this time
Where lies the true forgiveness?
Not this time
Do you think you could forget this?
Not this time
Can you please erase this?
Not this time
