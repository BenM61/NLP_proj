The open way's too dangerous
Listen close, they're watching us
One more time you're losing us
Hold still, they're shooting us
First wave down!
I wonder when they're coming back
First wave down!

As leaves from modern trees
Rest on walls like these

I wonder what you're waiting for
I wonder what you're working for
I wonder what you're living for
I wonder what you're dying for
First wave down!
I wonder when they're coming back
First wave intact!

As leaves from modern trees
Rest on walls like these
The rest is theft

The walls don't move, don't change
Does it make you feel ashamed?
No dreams, no curse
Could we make things even worse?
Don't mean it's right
But it makes you see the light!
