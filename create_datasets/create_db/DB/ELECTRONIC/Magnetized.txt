I can see it in your eyes
You're a spirit I recognize
Feelings I cannot explain
And I don't even know your name

Do we only live to die
Or is it that our hearts are Magnetized
And our worlds collide for a reason
Do we only live to die
Or is it that our hearts are Magnetized
Going round and round like the seasons

Have I come to make amends
Are old enemies now my friends
And are you here to be my guide
To heal the wounds that I bear inside

Do we only live to die
Or is it that our hearts are Magnetized
And our worlds collide for a reason
Do we only live to die
Or is it that our hearts are Magnetized
Going round and round like the seasons

Been here many times before
With a different face from a different shore
Both here to discover the other again

Do we only live to die
Or is it that our hearts are Magnetized
And our worlds collide for a reason
Do we only live to die
Or is it that our hearts are Magnetized
Going round and round like the seasons

Been here many times before
With a different face from a different shore
We've lived many lives before
Fought on different sides of a hundred wars
