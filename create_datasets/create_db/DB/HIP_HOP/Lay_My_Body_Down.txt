Let the bass kick
(I love it, I love it, I love it)
Come on
(I love it, I love it, I love it)

Boy, I know that you should know by now
That when you touch me, yeah, you truly drives me wild
Go 'head, go down, boy, don't you be ashamed
This is all yours, I don't wanna feel no pain

I love it when, when you lay my body down
I love it when, when you lay my body down

Hold on real tight, baby, don't you let me go
The more you give me, the more I love you so
I won't hold back, boy, I know you're mine
And if you want me, well baby, take your time

I love it when, when you lay my body down
I love it when, when you lay my body down
I love it when, when you lay my body down
I love it when, when you lay my body down

Oh, when you lay my body down, my baby
Oh yeah, when you lay my body down

I love it when, when you lay my body down
I love it when, when you lay my body down
I love it when, when you lay my body down
