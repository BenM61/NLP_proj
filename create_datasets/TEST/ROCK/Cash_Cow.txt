Well, I've been taking my time
Slow going's nothing new to me
I've been taking my time
Slide up, just drop everything

Falling out of my car
I'm not sure what I'm doing here
Somehow wherever we are
I'm not sure what I'm doing here

I'm not gonna wait for anything to happen
All of this at once
I'm ready for the cash-in
And I'm not gonna wait for anything to happen, no, oh

Well, I've been talking a lot
I'm not saying much of anything
Well, I've been talking a lot
I'm not saying much of anything

I'm not gonna wait for anything to happen
All of this at once
I'm ready for the cash-in
And I'm not gonna wait for anything to happen, no, oh

I've been taking my time
I've been taking my time

I'm not gonna wait for anything to happen
All of this at once
I'm ready for the cash-in
And I'm not gonna wait for anything to happen, no, oh
