Some say that I'm just too much
I guess I caught your attention
One thing that you don't know
That I'm a mad ping pong player
Never get up when I should
Wearing some jeans a hood
I nearly get my hair done
I'm always good to go
Just need to scratch my old Afro

I won't turn my life around
'Cause I like it upside down

Oh, no, no, no
I never said I was an angel
Oh, no, no, no
I never be a little angel
How can I get to you darling
I wanna fell it so real

Oh no, no, no
I never said I was an angel

(Don't try to put her in a bag, put her in a bag, bag, bag)
(Don't try to put her in a bag, put her in a bag, bag, bag)

Some say that I'm on the run
I say it's time for some action (action)
(Yes it is)
I'll have my high and my lows
I guess it's just how my life goes
I always shower too long
And make my coffee to strong
My momma says I'm a lonely one
Can't make this story too long
Take my hand or be gone
(Better be gone, be gone gone)

I won't turn my life around
'Cause I like it upside down

Oh, no, no, no
I never said I was an angel
Oh, no, no, no
I never be a little angel
How can I get to you darling
I wanna fell it so real

Oh, no, no, no
I never said I was an angel
Oh, no, no, no
I never said I was a little angel
I never said I was a, said I was a angel
Oh, no, no, no
I never be a little angel

Oh, no, no, no (oh no babe)
How can I get to you darling (How can I get to)
I wanna fell it so real
I get let it go
Keep going going going

Oh, no, no, no
I never said I was an angel
