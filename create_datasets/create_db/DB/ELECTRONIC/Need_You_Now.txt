I need you now
Need you now
Say it loud
I need you now
I need you now
Need you now
Say it loud
I need you now

Tired of being myself
Caught up in this world
I never dreamed I could belong
To a state that don't see right from wrong
I never dreamed I would belong
To your place

I need you now
Need you now
Say it loud
I need you now
I need you now (In a place so far)
Need you now (In a place so far)
Say it loud
I need you now

Tied up in disgrace
How can we keep a man so long
Waiting for a fate
Stripped of all our hearts
Never dreamed we would belong
In a world, a world that's just gone wrong

And if we try to stand alone
We'll be playing with a force beyond control
Our faces pressed against the glass
In the knowledge you belong to us

I need you now
Need you now
Say it loud
I need you now
I need you now
Need you now
Say it loud
I need you now
I need you now
