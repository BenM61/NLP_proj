Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
I'm sad and lonely too
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
I'm fallin' in love with you

Just like you I'm wonderin' what I'm doin' here
Just like you I'm wonderin' what's goin' on

Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
The night will soon be gone

I have seen you standin' in the smoky haze
And I know that you're gonna be mine
One of these days, mine alone

Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me
Please let me ride you home
Wallflower, wallflower, would you dance me
I'm certainly lonely too
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me
I'm falling in love with you
I'm falling in love with you
