From the busy parks to the icy tides
Some day we'll decide
Where we want to live out our lives
Form out into sparks tumbling along
Keeping the heat on
Even though summer's coming on

I would sail across the east sea
Just to see you on the far side
Where the wind is cold and angry
There you'll be to take me inside
We'll find ways to fill the empty
Far from all the hysteria
I don't care if we suddenly
Find ourselves in Siberia, Siberia

Inside a street car or on a mountain trail
Details, details, you breathe in when I exhale
No matter where we are
Or which way the wind blows
Or how heavy the snow
Nothing can change where we will go

I would sail across the east sea
Just to see you on the far side
Where the wind is cold and angry
There you'll be to take me inside
We'll find ways to fill the empty
Far from all the hysteria
I don't care if we suddenly
Find ourselves in Siberia, Siberia

Siberia
Siberia
Siberia
Siberia

I would sail across the east sea
Just to see you on the far side
Where the wind is cold and angry
There you'll be to take me inside
We'll find ways to fill the empty
Far from all the hysteria
I don't care if we suddenly
Find ourselves in Siberia, Siberia
