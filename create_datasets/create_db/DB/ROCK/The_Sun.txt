If you look real high
You just might find
Sitting in the stars
Glistening, glistening
Waiting for the band to come
Just waiting for that man to come
Oh, I wonder

Slip on down from that sun
To climb down to earth
And down to things like time
Because we are all, we are all just lovers
Born of earth and light like all these others

If you're talking to the moon
The moon might sing about the universe
Shouting out I don't need, I don't need time
I breathe in time
Where, where are we now?
Where, where are we now?

Slip on down from that sun
To climb down to earth
And down to things like time
Because we are all, we are all just lovers
Born of earth and light like all these others

If you're looking for the river
Just find the mouth
It's grinding like gnashing teeth foaming out, foaming out
Mixing up that hell to come
Just mixing up the hell to come
And it's fixing up to swallow me whole
Fixing up to swallow me whole
Fixing up to swallow my soul
Fixing up to swallow me whole

Slip on down from that sun
To climb down to earth
And down to things like time
Because we are all, we are all just lovers
Born of earth and light like all these others
We are all, we are all
Where, where are we now?
We are all, we are all
Where, where are we now?
We are all, we are all
Where, where are we now?
Oh, I wonder
