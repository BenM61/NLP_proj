Fancy lady is masquerading
With a heart that nobody can see
Time is wasting there
There's no escaping it
How long will your sweet pleasure be

Fancy lady, you are just a stranger
To all the lovers you don't get to know
You try hiding all the broken traces
For the one love you had to let go

I got love, sample my wares
I got love, try if you dare
I got love, sample my wares
You got plenty love inside

Fancy lady, where are all the children
Who were born to you, so sweet and true
Will you give them all your sad parading
Have them doing the same things you do

The great creator, he's a liberator
He always gives a helping hand
Fancy lady, time's no waiter
Find yourself while
You still have a chance
