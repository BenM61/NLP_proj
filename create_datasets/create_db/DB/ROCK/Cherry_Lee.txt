Two days in my room
Just waiting for you Cherry
And I know that I have been too lazy
You forgot about our little secret
Oh! yes I want to have it all

Cherry Lee
Oh! no
You know I need some garanty
My friend
'cause I still got my dignity
You know
And I will never let you go

I want it all

Three weeks in your room
Just waiting for me baby!
You're nuts!
You act like you were thirteen
Oh please!
Forget about this secret
'cause you will never have it all

Cherry Lee
Oh! no
You know I need some garanty
My friend
'cause I still got my dignity
You know
And I will never let you go

I want it all

and now that no one remembers your name
You'll be mine forever
You'll be mine again
