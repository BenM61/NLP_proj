I wake up crying
After tossin' and turnin'
And yearnin' the whole night long 
Pretty baby, since you went away
I haven't spent a happy day

I wake up crying
After sobbin' and sighin'
And wonderin' just what went wrong 
Pretty baby, I was good to you
Why'd you go and make me blue?
I need your arms to hold me tight
I need your lips to kiss me goodnight
I'm so unhappy on my own 
Don't, don't leave me sad and lonely

I wake up crying
After tossin' and turnin'
And yearnin' the whole night long 
Pretty baby, please come back to me
Save me from this misery
Oh baby, won't you save me from this misery?
Oh baby, won't you save me from this misery?
