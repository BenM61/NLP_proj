Love me as though there were no tomorrow;
Take me out of this world tonight.
Take me; make me forget my sorrow,
So when I wake tomorrow, I'll know our love was right.
Kiss me as though it were now of never;
Teach me all that a heart should know.
Love me as though there were no tomorrow;
Oh my darling, love me; don't ever let me go.

Kiss me as though it were now or never;
Teach me all that a heart should know.
Love me as though there were no tomorrow;
Oh my darling, love me; don't ever let me go.
