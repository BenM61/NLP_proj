It's your fear
Keeps you home
The darkness swings
A silent phone is all you got
If somebody calls today
It won't be safe here any more

Late night conversation
Turns into a fight and all
The years you've been frustrated
They finally subside
And now you walk away
To face
The day
Alone

It's safe right here
Behind closed doors
And if your ears
You hear by choice and not by will
You stated your cause today
You won't be staying any more 

Late night conversation
Turns into a fight and all
The years you've been frustrated
They finally subside
And now you walk away
To face
The day
Alone

Miscommunication
Turns into a fight and all
The years you've been frustrated
They finally subside
And now you walk away
To face
Your day
Alone
