Got a new gig, here you come again kid
Fresh out the dog, done did your bid
But you can't stay here no more
Not in this crib

Not with the foul way that you used to live
I remember you would take long trips on the first of the month
Not giving a f*ck about what I want
Break, uh! Breathe Lyte! Breathe!

The day that you left I spent mad dough trying to get shit fixed
'Cause of your fucking death wish
Broken glass everywhere, 
'Cause a motherfucka' like you just didn't care
Got my shit shot up, 
Had to buy a new body for my Benz, 
'Cause of your wild ass friends

Years ago when you started on the scene, 
Back and forth smuggling shit from Caribbean
It was you and your boy Dunn, making them suicide runs
But it was all in fun till Dunn tried to run with half of your cut
Now your boss is looking at you saying "What the f*ck is up?"

What's up? But you say, "F*ck him" 
You could start your own ring and things
Besides you get a lot of peeps to swing
Now you got eight men working 7 days a week
2 be the runners, 5 on the street

1 be the side kick,, the right hand, 
You know the one that ride shotgun thinking he the man
They'd kill to be where you are, oh yeah! 
The drug lord superstar
You got a new crib, new truck, new car
Trying to fit in, 
Throwing parties for them big type rap stars

But on the other side of town, 
Shit is getting hot, 
Your man got shot
And they blew up your tree spot, 
On 125th and St. Nick, 
Shit is getting thick
Your boy got caught in St. Martin with a brick, 
Now he's exile
You down to 6 motherfuckas 
And three of them motherfuckas is nothing but suckas

I got feds at my door want to know do I know a black
Now I ain't never called ya no shit like that, I'm fed up
I can't take it no more, 
You see I'm blazing at the next nigga knocking at my door
I heard you're on the run now, 
D is in the penile

Ratted your ass out and gave that what, 
When and how
They'd all kill to be where you are, 
The druglord superstar
They found a boy in the sand, 
It was Poppi your man 
With his eyes dug out and you must
Be soft

Heard they shot up your car 
And ransacked your loft, now you need a get away
A place to hide, 
'cause your man done snitched on the inside
You was on the run like a slave aback in the days, 
You must have been nodding when
They said

"Crime don't pay"
I got a new gig, here you come again kid, 
Fresh out the dog
Done did your bid but you can't stay here no more, 
Not in this crib
Not with the foul way that you choose to live

Motherfucker, you know what
Just, just take your shit all right! Just take it!
Cause I'm sick of this shit, 
I can't take it no more
Just take it, 
I don't know who the f*ck you think you are

Thinking you could just come back here 
And try to enter my life, like I need you
I don't
I'm through with you motherfucker
Just get out! 
You put me through too much heartache
Too much shit

I had to go through,
I can't do it no more
