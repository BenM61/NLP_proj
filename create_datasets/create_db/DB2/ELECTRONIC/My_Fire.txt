Just bring it on down.
Just bring it on down.
Just bring it on down.

Relight my fire
Your love is my only desire.
Relight my fire
Cause I need your love.

Bring it on down, I'll take it higher.
Feel your body burning with desire.
One step a little closer,
turn around and take it like you're supposed ta; a roller coasta.
About this time I'll make a suggestion;
get on the dance floor but use discretion.
It's hot, and when I find the spot...

Relight my fire
Your love is my only desire.
Relight my fire
Cause I need...

Relight my fire
Your love is my only desire.
Relight my fire
Cause I need your love, ooh.
