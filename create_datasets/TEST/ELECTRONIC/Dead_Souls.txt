Someone take these dreams away
That point me to another day
A dual personality
A strange but true reality

They keep calling me
Keep on calling me
They keep calling me

Figures from the past stand tall
And mocking voices ring above
Imperialistic house of prayer
Conquistadors who took their share

They keep calling me
Keep on calling me
They keep calling me
