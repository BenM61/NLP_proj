Make mine old time, or I'il spit in your eye
It's better than lying, anytime . . .
I'm horrified of modern times, I'm trying
Very hard to keep up my guard
Everything's becoming drag, we'd best be off
Escape the bad- could be very sad
Misery coming over me, I'm thinking about
Going blind and don't want to see.

Shift around this one-song town
Like a sparrow with a broken wing -feeling blue!!!
Terrified to step outside, it's so easy
To make a suicide come true
Masturbation-getting off; you can scoff
Your ideals offer nothing new!
I'm getting ready to run and hide,
Looking for a suitable bitch to crucify.

We're all beginqing to
Testify, testify-it's getting fierce
We're all beginning to testify,
Testify, to be cavaliers
How does it feel now you've testified?

Love to have God next to me with his
Hands around my throat in harmony
Take away the silver tray, fetch me water
God, give me strength, I'm in pain
Seeing, blow-job blues and boogaloos
Ten little niggers hooked on absinthe and daffodils
Telling tales of white gardinia,
Honky-tonking all the love that's in ya!

We're all beginqing to
Testify, testify-it's getting fierce
We're all beginning to testify,
Testify, to be cavaliers
How does it feel now you've testified?

Long-tailed coat, a silly joke; they drink
Like men then see them choke on coca-cola
Morgue-like iips and waitress tips and you
Shuffle around on your sabrina hips
Make mine old time or I'll spit in your eye
It's better than lying-anytime
Horrified to step outside, trying very
Hard to keep up my guard.

We're all beginqing to
Testify, testify-it's getting fierce
We're all beginning to testify,
Testify, to be cavaliers
How does it feel now you've testified?
