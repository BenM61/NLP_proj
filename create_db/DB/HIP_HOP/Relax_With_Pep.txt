My styles will move 
I'm calm but deadly  heat up but cool 
I'm rough as a right hook but still look smooth 
Even when I'm unseen  I show and prove 
Women  I give 'em pain and still soothe 
As I 'll put you down ?(when them)?  hard to put up wit 
Swell up like helium but I can make you fit 
I'm taking what I want and make you want to give it here 
Provoking you to flaunt  you get the idea 
Got it, gone, my schedule is packed 
My day is lay back 'cause I'm ahead of all that 
Then I can relax 'cause I'm before my time 
I hand you a manual before the rhymes 
So you can catch up and keep up and move right alone 
The day is kind of off but I can get it on 
I'm taking it step by step and when the night is in depth 
It's cool 'cause I'm relax wit pep 
Relax wit pep 
Relax wit pep 

I inchant a riot wit a quiet storm 
Is it the way I parlay or the knowledge being born 
All praise due to the magnificient, most high and magnificient 
From him, I was sent wit intent to invent 
New ways for better displays, for better days 
No more crimes, I got rhymes and it pays 
I'm prepared to take mine and get mine 
And I can protect mine even wit a rhyme or a nine 
A silent rage but ?(I'm amplified)? 
Rhymes multiply, it's hard to provoke when I 
Put a mode in effect, the episode's correct 
Reload and you don't know code to respect 
I get swift and change a rule, adapt the master 
But still remainable, rap gets faster 
Reacts and projects and tracks and it get 
To the max, it's in depth, it attacks but it's relax wit pep 
Relax wit pep 
Relax wit pep, relax wit pep 

Check one, them I'm a check another one, two 
The are's brand new so you can view a view 
I got equisite, exhibit, explizzit 
Is it a whiz kid or kid quiz it, well is it 
Relax, I'll track out, lap the halpf stepper 
Here come the right one baby and Dr. Pepper 
So check the wreck up scale rhymes overload 
Blow up and explode, abrupt and reload the code 
You can't pinpoint a low cape, the rape 
Or evaluate the up to date, skate 
Up front, laid back, coming off on track 
Girls want some of this because I'm all of that 
Sweat the concept as the ?(epps)? in depth 
As the track is kept, you can't intercept the step 
React and projects and it tracks and it gets 
To the max and in depth, it attacks but it's relax wit pep 
Relax wit pep 
Relax wit pep, it's relax wit pep
