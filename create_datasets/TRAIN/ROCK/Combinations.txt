I, I saw you there, wanted you there
I, I knew that it was best for me
You brought me back to that place in my heart
I thought was gone, oh so long
I was unhappy now it's gone
And I'm moving on, moving on
I'm moving on

I went for so long
And I was so wrong
And then I met you
And now I can't live without you
And I don't want to
I've done that all my life up till now

Pass the evening, bring tomorrow
How could we know that night would bring us into daylight
Combination all around us
Fill our heads with the love we've been feeling
For time long past

I went for so long
And I was so wrong
And then I met you
And now I can't live without you
And I don't want to
I've done that all my life up till now

All the time, darling now, oh
All the time, now we'll have to make it up
We'll make it up, oh
All the days, darling now, oh
All the days, now we'll have to make them up
We'll make them up somehow
We'll make them up

I went for so long
And I was so wrong
And then I met you
And now I can't live without you
And I don't want to
I've done that all my life

I went for so long
And I was so wrong
And then I met you
And now I can't live without you
And I don't want to
I've done that all my life up till now
