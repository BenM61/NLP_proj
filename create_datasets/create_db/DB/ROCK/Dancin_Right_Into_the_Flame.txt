All alone in the twilight
I'm a shadow in the room
Time is my companion
But it turned its back too soon
Imagination will take me anywhere I want to go
But with my ballerina
Both of us lost in a-
Love light from an old Roman candle
Midnight won't be the same
When I close my eyes
We're dancin' right into the flame
The pciture is fading
Like a vision from my soul
Nothing left but a memory
In the silver afterglow
She may be gone, but not forgotten
Inside my heart, yeah-
But with my ballerina
Both of us lost in a-
Love light from an old Roman candle
Midnight won't be the same
When I close my eyes
We're dancin' right into the flame
My mind seems to wander away
And play me like a fool
I wish it could be like the way it was
'Cause life can be so cruel
But with my ballerina
I live in a dream of a-
Love light from an old Roman candle
Midnight won't be the same
When I close my eyes
We're dancin' right into the flame
Love light from an old Roman candle
Midnight won't be the same
When I close my eyes
We're dancin' right into the flame
