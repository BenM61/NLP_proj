What am I supposed to do with all these blues
Haunting me
Everywhere no matter what I do
Watching the candle flicker out in the evening glow
I can't let go 
When will the night be over

I didn't mean to fall
In love with you
And baby there's a name 
For what you put me through
It isn't love
It's robbery
I'm sleeping with the ghost of you and me

Seen a lot of broken hearts go sailing by phantom ships
Lost as sea and one of them is mine
Raising my glass I sing a toast to the midnight sky
I wonder why the stars don't seem to guide me

I didn't mean to fall
In love with you
And baby there's a name 
For what you put me through
It isn't love
It's robbery
I'm sleeping with the ghost of you and me

The ghost of you and me when will it set me free
I hear voices call following footsteps down the hall
Trying to save what's left of my heart and soul
Watching the candle flicker out in the evening glow
I can't let go when will the night be over

I didn't mean to fall
In love with you
And baby there's a name 
For what you put me through
It isn't love
It's robbery
I'm sleeping with the ghost of you and me
