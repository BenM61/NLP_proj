When he spoke she smiled in all the right places
In her smile he saw the poison she tasted
She wasn't listening to the sweet words
He wasn't listening to her lying tongue
He was listening to the words being sung
By the blue boy

Friends told him of her young heart's passion
Down by the sea where the blue waves crashing
She wasn't listening to the sweet words
He wasn't listening to her lying tongue
He was listening to the words being sung
By the blue boy

Oh curse and bless him with the gabardine which surrounds him
See him writhe at the sight of your eyes which repel him
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
He won't be listening to your sweet words
He won't be listening to your lying tongue
He'll be listening to the words being sung
By the blue boy

Whoa whoa blue boy
Whoa whoa blue boy
Whoa whoa blue boy
Cheerio, blue boy
