We meet and it begins
The sound of violins
The song of birds high on the wing
You taught my heart to sing

Why does this heart of mine
Feel like a valentine
You smiled and suddenly it's spring
You taught my heart to sing

My heart was an empty shell
Then you came along
Now my heart's a carousel
Filled with song

The miracle of you
Will last my whole life through
You're all I'll keep remembering
You taught my heart to sing

My heart was an empty shell
Then you came along
Now my heart's a carousel
Filled with song

The miracle of you
Will last my whole life through
You're all I'll keep remembering
You taught my heart to sing

Oh la la la la la la la

You taught my heart
You taught my heart to sing
You taught my heart to sing
