Sometimes you love me like a good man oughta
Sometimes you hurt me so bad, my tears run like water
You get me out right before your friends
Then you disown me baby, until we're alone again

Your love is like a see saw
Your love is like a see saw, baby
Your love is like a see saw
Goin' up an' down, all around, like a see saw

Sometimes you tell me you don't need my sweet candy man
And then sometimes, baby, never know where I stand
You lift me up when I'm on the ground
But as soon as I get up, child, you send me tumbling down

Now your love is like a see saw
Your love is like a see saw, baby
Your love is like a see saw
Goin' up, down, all around, it's like a see saw

When I kiss you and I like it
And I ask you to kiss me again
When I reach at you, you jump to lean out of sight
You change just like the wind
That ain't right, that ain't right, that ain't right, 
That ain't right, baby

Your love is like a see saw
Your love is like a see saw, baby
Your love is like a see saw
Goin' up, goin' down, all around, it's like a see saw

Your love is like a see saw
Your love is like a see saw, baby
Your love is like a see saw
Goin' up, goin' down, all around, it's like a see saw

Yeah seesaw baby
