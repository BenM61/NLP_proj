There's no reason for you to lose your mind,
'Cause I've seen something,
That's gonna change our time.

If I could, I'd make you understand.
If I could, I'd make you understand.

Ah...
There's no hurry,
It's gonna come for sure,
'Cause I know that someday,
We're gonna end our war.

If I could, I'd make you understand.
If I could, I'd make you understand.
Yes, I'd stay, and if I...I...

If I could I would now.

Oh my baby, oh baby...

And if I could, I'd make you understand.
If I could, then I'd make you understand.

There's no reason for you to lose your mind. (Seal&Joni)
