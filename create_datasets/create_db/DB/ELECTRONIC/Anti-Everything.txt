I hate drinking coffee in the morning
I hate that place everybody goes
If it's fun, I'll probably think it's boring
Just like that song everybody knows

So put your hands up in the air
If you hate songs that tell you to
Put your hands up in the air
Up, up, up in the air

'Cause I'm anti-everything, but I love you
I'm fucking miserable 'til you walk into the room, yeah
I talk a lot of shit, but swear you'll get used to it
'Cause I'm anti-everything, but
Everything but you
Everything but you
Everything but

I hate every second you're not with me
I hate when we have to say goodbye
You're the only one who makes me feel things
'Cause I usually feel nothing inside

So put your hands up in the air
If you hate songs that tell you to
Put your hands up in the air
Up, up, up in the air

'Cause I'm anti-everything, but I love you
I'm fucking miserable 'til you walk into the room, yeah
I talk a lot of shit, but swear you'll get used to it
'Cause I'm anti-everything, but
Everything but you
Everything but you
Everything but

I'm anti-everything, but I love you
I'm fucking miserable 'til you walk into the room, yeah
I talk a lot of shit, but swear you'll get used to it
'Cause I'm anti-everything, but
Everything but you

'Cause I'm anti-everything, but I love you
I'm fucking miserable 'til you walk into the room
And I talk a lot of shit, but swear you'll get used to it
'Cause I'm anti-everything, but
Everything but you
