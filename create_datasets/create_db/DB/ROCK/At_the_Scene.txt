Everyone who is lonely
I've got a place for you
Where the music play-ay-ay-ay-ays
Till way past two

Come along now, let's go down to the scene
(Well, what's it like now)
Meet me down at the scene
(Well, tell me more, tell me more)
You'll live just like a queen
When you're down at the scene

There's no need to be fancy
No one there will stare
Dress in all the things you usually do
There's no need to care

Come along now, let's go down to the scene
(All right, all right)
Meet me down at the scene
(I'm comin', I'm comin')
You'll live just like a queen
When you're down at the scene
