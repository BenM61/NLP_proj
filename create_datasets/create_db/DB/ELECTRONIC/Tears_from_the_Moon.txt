Couldn't sleep
So I went out walking
Thinking about you
Hearing us talking
And all the things
I should have said
Echo now inside my head

I feel something
Falling from the sky
I'm so sad
I make the Angels cry

Tears from the Moon
Fall down like rain
I reach for you
I reach in vain
Tears from the Moon
Tears from the Moon

It just ain't fair
This thing called Loving
When one's still there
And the Other feels nothing
I would have done
Anything for you
I still love you, Baby I do
All day I keep
From falling apart
But at night
When the sky gets dark

Tears from the Moon
Fall down like rain
I reach for you
I reach in vain

Stop
Stop haunting me
It should be easy
As easy as when you
Stopped wanting me

Tears from the Moon

Tears from the Moon
Fall down like rain
I reach for you
I reach in vain

Tears from the Moon
Tears from the Moon
Tears from the Moon
I reach in vain
