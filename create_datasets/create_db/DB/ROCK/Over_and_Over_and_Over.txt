The Sisyphean dreamer
My fibula and femur
Hold the weight of the world
(Over and over)
I think, therefore I die
Anxiety and I rolling down a mountain
(Over and over)

My shoulder holds the weight of the world

Yeah, the wind is blowing
Volcano's blowing, my lungs are blowing
(Over and over)
Who could not win the mistress, wooed the maid
With the no sign of a grave
(Over and over)
(Over and over)

Hollow body
One deli perfetti
Move like a son of porcini
(Over and over)
The rock 'n' roller, the young and older
Rolling back to the stroller
(Over and over)

And although you've warned me
The gods have all scorned me now

The wind is blowing
Volcano's blowing, my lungs are blowing
(Over and over)
Who could not win the mistress, wooed the maid
With the no sign of a grave
(Over and over)
(Over and over)

(Over and over)

And I'm punished for the passion
Only telling 'cause you're asking
And am I gutting for the tasking?

And the love is all drowning
And they're never gonna find 'em
'Cause the eagle's gonna blind 'em
(Over and over)

Yeah, my shoulder on a boulder
Holds the weight of the world

Oh, the wind is blowing
Volcano's blowing, my lungs are blowing
(Over and over)
Who could not win the mistress, wooed the maid
With the no sign of a grave
(Over and over)

My shoulder holds the weight of the world
(Over and over)
(Over and over)

The Sisyphean dreamer
My fibula and femur
Hold the weight of the world
(Over and over)
I think, therefore I die
Anxiety and I rolling down a mountain
(Over and over)
(Over and over)

And although you've warned me
The gods have all scorned me now
