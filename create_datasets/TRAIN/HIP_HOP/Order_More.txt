She said she's a good girl she don't do this much she celibate
So just be careful and be delicate
Then I f*ck her so damn good, swear I invented it

After we hit the club we hit the titty bar

So if you want this cash you gotta show some more
That private dance is through that corridor (Let's go)
I'm off drugs and a bunch of shots
After party at my crib with a bunch of thots
So order more bottles don't care what the cost
My neighbor is a bitch they tried to call the cops (You bitch)
F*ck you I'm living life, all good don't need advice
Pussy is my favorite vice, I see you I get enticed

Yeah baby, make it clap 'cause we got cash on the menu
