It's just a simple melody
Designed to haunt your memory
It's bound to get you instantly

Oh, it doesn't help you to beware
Before you even know it's there
You're swaying to its catchy air

Dancing with your favorite thrill
He will hold you closer still

And suddenly you'll both agree
That dancing can be heavenly
To just a simple melody

De de de, that melody
De de de, keeps haunting me
It's just a simple melody

De de, de de de, de de
Duh duh, doo doo, de de
De de, de de, doo doo de
Oh, da da doo, dum de, doo doo, melody
