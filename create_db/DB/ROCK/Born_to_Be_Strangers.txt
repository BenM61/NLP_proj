James, pick a frame
I got you goin' insane
With your lit up fuse
Film everything
About your life
Now and share your views
Look, that fickle game
A-got me goin' insane
But I know what to do
'Cause you, inglorious you
You got me broken in two
But I don't feel no fool
God, don't feel no fool
But I don't feel no fool

And some of us will always be strangers
And some of us, we seek out danger

You, inglorious you
And you make me feel
Like I'm broken in two
Love, love better fire
I'm weak at the knees
But I know what to do
Cry those bitter tears
I used to feel so alone
And now I got my own

Let it go to your head
Let it go to your head
Let it go to your head

'Cause some of us are born to be strangers
Alone in this world, we seek out danger
And some of us will always be strangers
And some of us are always seekin' out danger

And some of us are born to be strangers
Wanna be with you, it feels so contagious
And some of us don't care what you're saying here
And some of us, we seek out danger

That country soul blues thing
That country soul blues thing
That country city, city
Country blues thing
