They had an accident and they never noticed anyway
A lack of originality couldn't focus on the day
So much for are the radio everybody sounds the same
Everybody wears the same clothes now and everybody plays the game

Copycat, copycat, copycat
Copy copy copy copy yourself
Copycat, copycat, copycat
Copy copy copy everyone else x2

I've got a great idea I will change things on my own
I see my vision very clear
Wouldn't want to be another clone
So much for the radio, the radio is sad
Sad, sad, sad

Copycat, copycat, copycat
Copy copy copy copy yourself
Copycat, copycat, copycat
Copy copy copy everyone else x2

They had an accident but they never noticed anyway
A lack of originality couldn't focus on the day
So much for the radio everybody sounds the same
Everybody wears the same clothes now, and
Everybody plays the game

Copycat, copycat, copycat
Copy copy copy copy yourself
Copycat, copycat, copycat
Copy copy copy everyone else x2

Copy everyone else
Copy everyone else
Copy everyone else
Copy everyone else
