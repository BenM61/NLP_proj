Dance, it's all I wanna do, so won't you dance?
I'm standing here with you; why won't you move?
I'll get inside your groove 'cause I'm on fire, fire, fire, fire
It hurts when you get too close, but, baby, it hurts
If love is really good, you just want more
Even if it throws you to the fire, fire, fire, fire

All the lovers that have gone before
They don't compare
To you
Don't be frightened
Just give me a little bit more
They don't compare
All the lovers

Feel--can't you see there's so much here to feel?
Deep inside in your heart you know I'm real
Can't you see that this is really higher, higher, higher, higher?
Breathe--I know you find it hard, but, baby, breathe
You'll be next to me; it's all you need
And I'll take you there; I'll take you higher, higher, higher, higher

All the lovers that have gone before
They don't compare
To you
Don't be frightened
Just give me a little bit more
They don't compare
All the lovers

Dance, it's all I wanna do, so won't you dance?
I'm standing here with you; why won't you move?
Even if it throws you to the fire, fire, fire

All the lovers that have gone before
They don't compare
To you
Don't be frightened
Just give me a little bit more
They don't compare
All the lovers
