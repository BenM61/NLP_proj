I am a fire starter, no ventilation, now I'm kneeling
As the smoke is swallowing
No need for water, darling, I'm dedicated to a feeling
I can't help but following

A slow roulette, a sweet duet
I can't forget, I'm tryin'

Feel the powder burn, tonight, tonight
There'll be nowhere to turn, it's alright, alright
And I burn, and I want that feeling again

I hear somebody calling
And now the fire's in the ceiling
There's no way to stop it now

A silhouette, of sweet regret
I can't forget, I'm tryin'

Feel the powder burn, tonight, tonight
Thre'll be nowhere to turn, it's alright, alright
And I burn, and no one can see me
And I yearn 'cuz I want that feeling again

A cigarette, the fuse is lit, I can't forget, I'm tryin'

Feel the powder burn, tonight, tonight
There'll be no self control, it's alright, alright
And I burn, and no one can see me tonight, tonight
And I yearn 'cuz I want that feeling, tonight, tonight, tonight
