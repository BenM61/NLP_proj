Can I get a witness?
Does anybody wanna come home with Pretty Ricky tonight?

He can't hit it like this, he can't hit it like that
He can't stroke it like this, he can't stroke it like that
So as you'll walk through that door I'll put 'em panties on the floor
I'll have you callin' for more, I'm the late night special

No hesitating
You already had me waiting too long for this
I know you wanna throw it right back
But my back's too strong for this

I'm aiming for the right spots, girl
Best to believe I won't miss
Let's get it on, clothes off
I could tell you want this

Your dancer, romancer
I do what I can
Call me commander, the chancer
Yes, I'm the man

'cause, 'cause my sex is hypnotizing
I'm right between your thighs and
Exotic positions
Got your orgasms multiplying

Yeah, I see the lust in your eyes
And you know you can't hide
And your walk and your vibe
Make the boy wanna try

Now 546 55 4713
Got a bag of treats like it's Halloween

No distractions, no questions asked
It's slicktastic, the freak-o-matic
Guaranteed that satisfaction
Got them whip lashes on your back

Any day, any time if I'm running through your mind
You want this mankind then see me on the line
Front back side to side, you can feel it on your spine
If I'm lying I'm flying for real but I ain't lying

I'm the late night crasher, the late night trasher
And the late night caster and the late night Casper
And the late night master, the late night
Late night special

Don't stop get it get it like Skywalker
Poppin' that nookie I'll be your groupie, late night stalker
Step up in it hit slow like a Moonwalker

Be your special delivery at your door
Leave your body shaking and shivering on the floor
Can you handle how I deal with this sexual healing
Your body like math divided in half

You ain't gotta close the door, just take them clothes off
Girl, I'm 'bout to break you off
I'm feeling on your body and your skin's so soft
If you wanna say no, then that's your loss

I never go soft, never go raw
Turn the telephone off, let me get in the fall
Swinging that thing tearing down your walls
Your can hear us through the walls
Oh yeah, you can feel us through the walls
