Late Tonight 
Love will come and creeping 
In your room tonight 
Grab tight 
Climb into your heart 
And twist it round 
Round and round 
Don't close your heart 
And mind don't run away 

A flash in the night 
Oh oh like a fireball 
Turning around 
Oh oh like a fireball, fireball 
A flame in the night 
Oh oh like a fireball 
I love making love 
Oh oh like a fireball, 
Fireball, fireball 
Oh oh like a firebal 

Close your door 
Love will take you over 
And your ask for more 
You'll be sure 
Nothing you have felt 
Could be so strong 
Oh so strong 
Can't stop the feeling 
Now can't turn away 

A flame in the night 
Oh oh like a fireball 
Turning around 
Oh oh like a fireball, fireball 
A flame in the night 
Oh oh like a fireball 
I love making love 
Oh oh like a fireball, 
Fireball, fireball 

A flame in the night 
Just turns you on 
You give up your heart 
And mind give up your soul 

A flash in the night 
Oh oh like a fireball 
Turning around 
Oh oh like a fireball, fireball 
A flame in the night 
Oh oh like a fireball 
I love making love 
Oh oh like a fireball, 
Fireball, fireball
