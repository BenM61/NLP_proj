I'm a young gun
Reload in the moment
You thought I was done
I've got the war won
Fear has you frozen
The bell has been rung
I'm the thorn inside your flesh
I terrorize your rest
I'm always miles ahead
I'm an outlaw
Quick with the draw when I rip you apart
There's no pit stop
Missing the mark
You're just ticking me off
Ride or die, I paralyze your threat
I crucified regret
Step aside, who's next

You think that you know me
You thought you could hold me
(You just don't know when to stop)
You think you could fool me
But you never knew me
So come and take your best shot

You know you can't touch this
No
So go throw your stones 'cause you're not even close
You know you can't touch this
No!
Yeah, you're moving too slow
So let it go
Let it go

No apology
The prodigy, honestly it's been the God in me
Never stopping me
In it to win it
I'll always be killing it
You follow blind like suicide
Have you lost your mind
I reclaim my life
Sleep with one eye open
I'm focused, you're choking, I'm golden
This is my time
Chosen to get it
I own it and exit
I'm awake, I'm alive, amen
I don't play pretend
Mercy never ends

You think that you know me
You thought you could hold me
(You just don't know when to stop)
You think you could fool me
But you never knew me
So come and take your best shot

You know you can't touch this
No
So go throw your stones 'cause you're not even close
You know you can't touch this
No
Yeah, you're moving too slow
So let it go
Let it go
Let it go

You can't
You can't
You can't touch this
You can't
You can't
You can't touch this
You can't
You can't
You can't touch this
You can't
You can't
You can't touch this

Not walking away or playing your game
I let you take your best shot
Been through the rain
Suffered the pain
You know this fighter never stops

You know you can't touch this
No
So go throw your stones 'cause you're not even close
You know you can't touch this
No
Yeah, you're moving too slow
So let it go
Let it go
Let it go

Let's go
Let it go
Let's go
