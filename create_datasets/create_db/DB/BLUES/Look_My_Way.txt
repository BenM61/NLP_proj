Oh baby,
Send this out to the pretty little girl in the red dress

If you see me walkin'
Baby won't you look my way
If you see me walkin'
Baby won't you look my way
I'm the one that wants you baby
Won't you look my way

No, I am not a bad man
Some say just a little wild
No, I am not a bad man
Some say just a little wild
I take you for a spin baby
Make you happy all the while

Maybe someday I'll come knockin'
Knockin' at your door
Maybe someday I'll come knockin'
Knockin' at your door
Give you some good lovin' baby
You'll be asking for more

Tell me, tell me, tell me
Baby what's a man to do
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Baby what's a man to do
When his heart has been broken
Broke in two

So if you see me walkin'
Baby won't you look my way
If you see me walkin'
Baby won't you look my way
I'm the one that wants you baby
Won't you look my way
