(The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark)
(The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark)

Here we are
At the end of the road, a road that's quietly caving in
Come too far to pretend that we don't, we don't miss where we started
Looking back, I see a setting sun, and watch my shadow fade into the floor
I am left standing on the edge
Wondering how we got this far, (How we got this far)

They left us alone
The Kids In The Dark
To burn out forever
Or light up a spark
We come together
State of the art
We'll never surrender
The kids in the dark
So let the world sing
"What a shame
What a shame
Beautiful scars
On critical veins"
Come together
State of the art
We'll never surrender
The Kids in the dark
The kids in the dark

(The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark)

Here we are at the top of the hill, a hill that's quietly crumbling
Been a while since you dressed for the kill, the kill that sent me tumbling
Looking up, I see a falling star, and watch it's fire burn into the floor
And I am left standing on the edge
Wondering why we fall so hard, why we fall so hard

They left us alone
The Kids In The Dark
To burn out forever
Or light up a spark
We come together
State of the art
We'll never surrender
The kids in the dark
So let the world sing
"What a shame
What a shame
Beautiful scars
On critical veins"
Come together
State of the art
We'll never surrender
The Kids in the dark
The kids in the dark

(The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark)

They left us alone
The Kids In The Dark
To burn out forever
Or light up a spark
We come together
State of the art
We'll never surrender
The kids in the dark
So let the world sing
"What a shame
What a shame
Beautiful scars
On critical veins"
Come together
State of the art
We'll never surrender
The Kids in the dark
The kids in the dark

(The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark)
We'll never surrender
The Kids in the dark
The kids in the dark
