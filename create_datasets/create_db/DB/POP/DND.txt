DND 
Now they'll leave us alone 

DND 
Now you turn off the phone 
How like you to make the whole world disappear and 
How like you to make everything seem so clear and 
How like you to make me want to stay forever 
Here behind your door 

DND 
Hang the sign on the door 
DND 
Don't disturb us no more 

How like you to make your love my hideaway and
How like you to make my troubles slide away and 
How like you to make me want to play forever 
Here behind your door 

Minute I got some space and time I wanted to get me back in the crowd 
Minute I got some peace you found me trying to make my way to the loud 
What a clown

DND 
Leave the hotel at noon 
DND 
Will I see you soon? 

How like you to make the whole world disappear and 
How like you to make everything seem so clear and 
How like you to make me want to stay forever 
Here behind your door 

DND 
DND 
DND 
Now they'll leave us alone
