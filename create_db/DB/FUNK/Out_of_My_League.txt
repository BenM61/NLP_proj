More than just a dream
More than just a dream

Forty days and forty nights
I waited for a girl like you to come and save my life
All the days I waited or you
You know the ones who said I'd never find someone like you

You are out of my league
All the things I believe
You were just the right kind
Yeah, you are more than just a dream
You are out of my league
Got my heartbeat racing
If I die don't wake me
'Cause you are more than just a dream

From time to time I pinch myself
Because I think my girl mistakes me for somebody else
And every time she takes my hand
All the wonders that remain become a simple fact

You are out of my league
All the things I believe
You were just the right kind
Yeah, you are ore than just a dream
You are out of my league
Got my heartbeat racing
If I die don't wake me
'Cause you are more than just a dream

You are out of my league
All the things I believe
You were just the right kind
Yeah, you are ore than just a dream
You are out of my league
Got my heartbeat racing
If I die don't wake me
'Cause you are more than just a dream
