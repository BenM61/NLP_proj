I had the craziest dream last night, yes I did
I never dreamt it could be
Yet there you were, in love with me
I found your lips close to mine so I kissed you
And you didn't mind it at all
When I'm awake such a break never happens
How long can a guy go on dreaming?

If there's a chance that you care
Then please, say you do, baby
Say it and make my craziest dream come true

And if there's a chance that you care
Then please, say you do, baby
Say it and make my craziest dream come true
