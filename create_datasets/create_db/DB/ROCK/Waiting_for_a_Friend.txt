If I fell in a lake
Would you dive in or stand there and gape
And if I drowned, would you jump
Or would you let the water burst in my lungs
Well a stranger in the street
Maybe the only one on his knees
When your laying by the roadside
Waiting for a friend to come.

Got my hopes
Got my doubts
My gut reaction say's I got to find out
Who's against, who to trust
Ooh you never know but I might get killed in the rush
But a stranger in the street
Maybe the only one on his knees
When your laying by the roadside
Waiting for a friend to come.

You laugh you think it's a joke
Just stand there grinning
Will you be there at the post
When I aint winning.

Hey, black or white
Good and bad
How many times have I done this and done that
Every life
Everyone
If I knew that I'd probley take out a gun
But it's mother natures law
To get you coming back for more
Just stand laying by the roadside
Waiting for a friend to come.

Laying by the roadside
Waiting for a friend to come.
