Closer, sight and the sound
Roller coaster, that merry-go-round
We can't wait for that show to start
That fire, that feeling, your heartbeat
We have what others can't tear apart, taking over

I fight to the end for the night of my life
And nothing can get in my way
And love is a river and river is ocean
Take of your pleasure and all that you cry for

I go to the wall for the night of my life
I play every game that you play
I shout out my struggles and send out a message to you
No early warning, I'm under the radar

You're closer, sight and the sound
Roller coaster
And baby, no one would go that far
To close all those doors behind us
And to the top of the world we climb, taking over

I fight to the end for the night of my life
And nothing can get in my way
I shout out my struggles and send out a message to you
No early warning, I'm under the radar

Calling love
(Calling love)
Take me to the love
(Calling love)
Take me to the morning
(Calling love)

I fight to the end for the night of my life
And nothing can stand in my way
And love has a color and colors are many
Blue is for lonely and red is for danger

I go to the wall for the night of my life
I play every game that you play
I shout out my struggles and send out a message to you
No early warning, I'm under the radar

Calling love
(Calling love)
Take me to the love
(Calling love)

Ain't no early warning
(Calling love)
Tell me what I do for you
(Calling love)

Calling love
(Calling love)
Get me to the love
(Calling love)

Tell me that you want it
(Calling love)
Tell me what I do for you

You're closer, sight and the sound
Roller coaster, that merry-go-round
