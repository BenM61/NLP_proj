It's been a long dark night 
And I've been a waitin' for the morning 
It's been a long hard fight 
But I see a brand new day a dawning 
I've been looking for the sunshine 
You know I ain't seen it in so long 
But everything's gonna work out just fine 
And everything's gonna be all right 
That's been all wrong 

'Cause I can see the light of a clear blue morning 
I can see the light of a brand new day 
I can see the light of a clear blue morning 
Oh, and everything's gonna be all right 
It's gonna be okay 

It's been a long long time 
Since I've known the taste of freedom 
And those clinging vines 
That had me bound, well I don't need 'em 
Oh, I've been like a captured eagle, you know an eagle's born to fly
Now that I have won my freedom, like an eagle I am eager for the sky

And I can see the light of a clear blue morning 
I can see the light of brand new day 
I can see the light of a clear blue morning 
Oh, and everything's gonna be all right 
It's gonna be okay 

I can see the light of a clear blue morning 
I can see the light of brand new day 
I can see the light of a clear blue morning 
Ooh, everything's gonna be all right 
Everything's gonna be all right 
Everything's gonna be all right 
It's gonna be okay 

And I can see the light of a clear blue morning 
I can see the light of a brand new day 
I can see the light of a clear blue morning 
Ooh and everything's gonna be all right 
Everything's gonna be all right 
Everything's gonna be all right 
It's gonna be okay 

I can see the light of a clear blue morning 
I can see the light of brand new day 
I can see the light of a clear blue morning 
Everything's gonna be all right 
Everything's gonna be all right 
Everything's gonna be all right 
It's gonna be okay
