Mr. David Hamilton is photographing me
Down among the lilies, down among the lilies
Shooting with his Hasselblad beneath a willow tree
One foot in the river, I'm bored and slightly chilly

Thursday goes and then Friday goes
And I long to strike another pose
Rain begins to patter on the leaves

Soft focus eroticism, art photography
Mr. David Hamilton and me

Mr. David Hamilton is photographing me
Like a pervert teacher with his languid creature
Sketching out an adolescent sexuality
Where Nature longs for Culture, Culture longs for Nature

His big umbrella flash gun goes
He comes to rearrange my clothes
I must ensure that my bare legs are seen

Romanticism, Classicism, Soft Pornography
Mr. David Hamilton and me

In the south of France I hear he keeps a house for waifs and strays
Where teenage girls like me can come and learn
Stay in bed till three o'clock and lounge about with nothing on
He only asks for photos in return

Mr. David, really, don't you think it's silly
A tank of liquid nitrogen, a cloud of carbon snow
Just to gild the lily, just to gild the lily

But if this lazy suffering
Can bring erection to the lap
Of just one man, it hasn't been in vain

Mr. David Hamilton is photographing me
Leaves begin to patter in the rain

(Instrumental)

Sunday goes and then Monday goes
And I long to strike another pose
A cow begins to nibble at my dress

Romanticism, Classicism, Soft Pornography
Mr. David Hamilton, I guess
