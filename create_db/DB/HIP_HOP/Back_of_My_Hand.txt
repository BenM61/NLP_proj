The back of my hand, the back of my hand 
I thought I knew you like the back of my hand. 
You acted so cruel, you know I can't stand. 
The things that you do cause you know that you 
Build me up just to break me down. 
Thought you were the one but I see you get around. 
I wanna go nuts when I see you on the town.
You built me up just to break me down. 

Your hit so cold, 
Your lips so bold. 
That every time I see you girl I'm hitting slow-mo. 
I used to have a heart of glass until it all froze. 
Maggie told me 'bout your little episode, no. 

I caught you fibbin'. 
What's the point in livin'. 
Sister he's the winner so give him the gold ribbon. 
I caught you lyin' 
Now what's the point in tryin'. 
I never thought you'd do me like that. 
Now I'm stuck here with all your little lies and it's your fault I don't recognize. 

The back of my hand, the back of my hand 
I thought I knew you like the back of my hand. 
You acted so cruel, you know I can't stand. 
The things that you do cause you know that you can.

The limo pulled up. I saw your new man. 
Bet he wouldn't hold up to the back of my hand. 
The back of my hand. 
The back of my hand. 
I thought I knew you like the back of my hand girl. 

A late night girl. 
Good morning. 
I called your phone and I could kind of hear some moaning. 
I crossed the line and all the signs were kind of warning. 
I saw the future like a mother fucking omen. 
It's my decision to go with my suspicions. 
Black magic woman I believe in superstition. 
The way you treat me. 
You might as well be tricking. 
I'm leaving and I'll never come back. No. 
Now I'm stuck here with all your little lies and it's your fault I don't recognize. 

The back of my hand, the back of my hand

The back of my hand. 
The back of my hand.

All the lovin', the bed we made; they're all lies. 
Girl I hung in forever hey; yeah I tried. 
All the fun and the letters babe: They're all lies. 
Now it's done and forget it babe; now I'm wise. 
Now I'm stuck here with all your little lies and it's your fault I don't recognize. 

The back of my hand, the back of my hand
