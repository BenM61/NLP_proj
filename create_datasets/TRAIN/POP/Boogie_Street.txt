O crown of light, o darkened one
I never thought we'd meet
You kiss my lips, and then it's done
I'm back on boogie street 

A sip of wine, a cigarette
And then it's time to go
I tidied up the kitchenette
I tuned the old banjo
I'm wanted at the traffic jam
They're saving me a seat
I'm what I am, and what I am
Is back on boogie street 

And o my love, I still recall
The pleasures that we knew
The rivers and the waterfall
Wherein I bathed with you
Bewildered by your beauty there
I'd kneel to dry your feet
By such instructions you prepare
A man for boogie street

O crown of light, o darkened one? 

So come, my friends, be not afraid
We are so lightly here
It is in love that we are made
In love we disappear
Tho' all the maps of blood and flesh
Are posted on the door
There's no one who has told us yet
What boogie street is for 

O crown of light, o darkened one
I never thought we'd meet
You kiss my lips, and then it's done
I'm back on boogie street

A sip of wine, a cigarette
And then it's time to go
