Everything I want to do
I only want to do with you
Everything I want to do
I only want to do with you

I will always have a bed to sleep on
And there'll always be a side for you
To let you into half my world
Baby that's the least that I can do
And I don't want to go to work
Unless you're there when I get back home
No, I don't want to go to work
Unless you're there when I get back home
And if you're not, then I won't eat
'Cause I don't want to eat alone

Everything I want to do
I only want to do with you
Everything I want to do
I only want to do with you

I don't ever want a house and garden
In the quiet of a dead-end town
But if that's what you require of me
Then I'll want to settle down
And I don't want kids of mine
Runnin' round and raisin' hell
No, I don't want kids of mine
Runnin' round and raisin' hell
But I don't care what my kids do
If they belong to you as well

Everything I want to do
I only want to do with you
Everything I want to do
I only want to do with you

So come with me and stay with me
And be with me everywhere I go
And love with me and live with me
And watch with me as the garden grows

I don't ever want to be an old man
I don't ever want to die alone
To face the shadows of my life
But never-never on my own

Everything I want to do
I only want to do with you
Everything I want to do
I only want to do with you

Yes, everything I want to do
I only want to do with you
Everything I want to do
I only want to do with you
