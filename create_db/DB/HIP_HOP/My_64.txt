[Chorus]
Cruising down the street in my 6 4
Jocking the bitches, slapping a hoe
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there, cold, shooting some hoops

Cruising down the street in my 6 4, jocking a bitch jocking a bitch
Cruising down the street in my (who), jocking a (Mike Jones, Jones, Jones)

Well I'm cruising down the street in my candy painted low (low)
Bouncing like a door, with 4 on my 6 4's
I pull up wood gripping, doors tipping sitting low
I'm hitting sixteen switches watch it stop and hit the floor

I'm leaning on the curb sipping syrup blowing dro
The girls show me love when they panties hit the floor
I said I'm leaning on the curb sipping syrup blowing dro
I got the 6 4 hopping, watch it stop and do a show

First I lean wit it, then I rock wit it
I got a candy apple drop wit a glock in it
First I lean wit it, then I rock wit it
I got a candy apple drop wit a glock in it

First I lean, then I rock, (Mike Jones)
First I lean, then I rock, (I said)
First I lean wit it, then I rock wit it
I got a candy apple drop wit a glock in it
(Because I'm)

[Chorus]

It's Bun B,
I'm known for slamming Cadillac doors
Coming down on that candy
With them swanger and them 4's
But I got love for the west coast (all day)

So I suppose I'm-a head out to Cali
The land of the low lows
Touchdown to L-A-X and I don't need no car
Robbie Chino pick me up with the bud and the bar

In the hood I'm-a star
So to the hood I'm-a go
With mike Jones and Snoop Dogg
And they already know

Then I get love from the B's
Love from the C's
Mexican, Asian that's a more of O G's
Throw it up when they see me

And holler hey Bun
When I'm coming out as soon as ansy gray one
You might see me at long beach
Or maybe Pasadena

Inglewood I e or West Covina
A southside ride with the homie big Kun
Car hopping, top dropping
The getting get good when I'm

[Chorus]

Big Snoop Dogg with a yellow paris hiny
With two girlies in the back in they Crip blue bikinis
Shaking and they jumping cause the deuce keep bouncing
Tipping, whipping, thats it, steady dipping
Candy paint dripping and these axles want a sipping

As I shake like a dice game
Cold as the ice age
Mike Jones rocking like a rolling stone
It's Snoop Dogg boy I'm B-B-Bad to the bone

Yea them Cali boys
We love them low lows
An real car club n****s bang they low doors
And take four tows

See everything is fine
I'm in the 64
A 60 trail a 59
I love my car

Like I love my wife
See low riding ain't a sport
Its a way of life
On the real dough I'll tell you how it feel though
If you see me in the for creeping slow yo

[Chorus]
