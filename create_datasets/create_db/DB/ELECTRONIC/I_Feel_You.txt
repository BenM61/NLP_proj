I feel you
Your sun it shines
I feel you
Within my mind
You take me there
You take me where
The kingdom comes
You take me to
And lead me through Babylon

This is the morning of our love
It's just the dawning of our love

I feel you
Your heart, it sings
I feel you
The joy it brings
Where heaven waits thre's golden gates
And back again
You take me to
And lead me through oblivion

This is the morning of our love
It's just the dawning of our love

I feel you precious soul
And I am whole
I feel you, your rising sun
My kingdom comes

I feel you
Each move you make
I feel you
Each breath you take
Where angels sing spread their wings
My love's on high
You take me home to glory's throne
By and by

This is the morning of our love
It's just the dawning of our love

This is the morning of our love
It's just the dawning of our love
