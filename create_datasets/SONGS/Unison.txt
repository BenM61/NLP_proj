Somewhere tonight, we come alive
Two hearts ignite, we're one of a kind 
Here we are, undivided by no one
Else but you and I 
Come so far, no one else can ever 
Steal away what we confide

Who wants to know?

We stick together, we're never apart
Everybody knows who we are
'Cause we are one, we do it in unison

Gleam of an eye, flash of a smile
Never too shy, playing ever so wild
Here we are, I'm relying on, no one else 
But you and I, come so far, no one else can ever
Steal away what we confide

Who wants to know?
