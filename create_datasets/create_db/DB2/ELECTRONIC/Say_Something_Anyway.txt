(Ciara:)
Some say hearts
Grow silent
In a world where no one cares
Love keep slipping away
Some say time
Is the healer
But in a house where no one speaks
Love keep slipping away

(All:)
Tell me
Why do we fight when we know it's all wrong
Why do we play that same old song
Is it just because
We're lonely

(All:)
Love me, love me
But don't be sorry
Help me, chase the shadows away
Love me, love me
When you've got nothing to say
Say something anyway

(Cathy:)
Some say tears
Run dry but
In my heart I've cried forever
Only you can take it away

(All:)
Tell me
Why do we fight when we know it's all wrong
Why can't we see what's going on
Is it just because
We're lonely

(All:)
Love me, love me
But don't be sorry
Help me, chase the shadows away
Love me, love me
When you've got nothing to say
Say something anyway

(Ciara:)
Anything to break the ice
Anything at all
Anything to break the ice
Anything at all

Love me, love me
But don't be sorry

(All:)
(Oh), love me, love me
But don't be sorry
Help me, chase the shadows away (the shadows away)
Love me, love me
When you've got nothing to say (you've got nothing to say)
Say something anyway
Help me chase the shadows away
Love me, love me
When you've got nothing to say
Say something anyway...
