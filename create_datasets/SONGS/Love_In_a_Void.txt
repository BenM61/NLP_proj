This is the happy house-we're happy here in the happy house oh it's such fun
We've come to play in the happy house
And waste a day in the happy house-it never rains 

We've come to scream in the happy house We're in a dream in the happy house
We're all quite sane 

This is the happy house-we're happy here There's room for you if you say "I do"
But don't say no or you'll have to go
We've done no wrong with our blinkers on It's safe and calm if you sing along 

This is the happy house-we're happy here in the happy house. 
To forget ourselves-and pretend all's well There is no hell.
