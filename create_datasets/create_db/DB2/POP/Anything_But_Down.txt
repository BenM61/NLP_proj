I light your cigarettes 
I bring you apples from the vine 
How quickly you forget 
I run the bath and pour the wine 

I bring you everything that floats into your mind 
You don't bring me anything but down 
You don't bring me anything but down 
You don't bring me anything but down 

When you come 'round 
You are a raging sea 
I pull myself out everyday 
I plead insanity 

'Cause I can't leave  but I can't stay 
You say, "Won't you come find me" and "Yes" is what I say 
But you don't bring me anything but down 
No, you don't bring me anything but down 

Everything is crashing to the ground 
Maybe I'm not your perfect kind 
Maybe I'm not what you had in mind 
Maybe we're just killing time 

You with your silky words 
And your eyes of green and blue 
You with your steel beliefs 
That don't match anything you do 

It was so much easier before you became you 
Now you don't bring me anything but down 
No, you don't bring me anything but down 
Everything just crashes to the ground 

When you come around, when you come around 
No more playing seek and hide 
No more long and wasted nights 
Can't you make it easy on yourself 

I know you wish you were strong 
You wish you were never wrong 
Well, I got some wishes of my own
