I have a special friend
He lives across the street
Sometimes he'll call me up
When he wants to play with me, play with me, play with me

We play all kinds of games
We both play hide and seek
Sometimes he'll find me fast
Sometimes it takes him weeks

Am I bit too old for games?
Too young to have a spouse
I like to try new things
I just like playing house

Although it's make believe
I know what love's about
Don't need no diamond ring
I just like playing house

I'm not a little girl
He's not a little boy
He comes into my world
And we share all our time, all, all our time, all, all our time

You look me in the eyes
And kiss me on the mouth
We both have separate lives
We're only playing house

Although it's make believe
I know what love's about
Don't need no diamond ring
I just like playing house

Ooh, but it feels like he loves me
When he's below or above me
If he ever sleeps away
I know he's thinkin' of me

And it feels like I love him
When I'm below or above him
And if he ever sleeps away
I'll have sweet memories of him

Don't need no diamond ring
I just like playing house
