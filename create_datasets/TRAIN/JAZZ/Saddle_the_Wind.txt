Sometimes I'd like to saddle the wind
And ride to where you are.
We may meet in a valley or on a green hill;
Will I be yours?  You know I will!

Dearest one, my place in the sun
Is by your side, I know;
So if I could I'd saddle the wind,
Some starry night I'll saddle the wind,
And straight to your arms I'll go!

So if I could I'd saddle the wind,
Some starry night I'll saddle the wind,
And straight to your arms I'll go!
