Early morning, as she wakes from her sleep 
9 to 5 is the day that she'll keep 
Ties her hair up and her blouse buttoned tight 
Gets her work done as she waits for the night... 
All the people, tell me what would they say 
If they knew her, how she hides it away 
Locked inside, there's the start of a flame 
And the feelings that she never will tame 

Ooh as she's walking around like a mystery 
Ooh there's a woman that nobody sees livin' inside 

Thrills in the night, far from the light, passion taking over 
Prices she pays, all through the days, no on really knows her 

In the evening when she takes to the street 
She goes hunting with a body in heat 
And desires she's kept hidden inside make her tingle 
And she knows why she lies 

Ooh as she's walking around like a mystery 
Ooh there's a woman that nobody sees living inside 

Thrills in the night, far from the light, passion taking over 
Prices she pays, all through the days, no on really knows her 

Thrills in the night, far from the light, passion taking over 
Prices she pays, all through the days, no on really knows her 

See the stranger that she's pushing away 
As she dresses for the start of a day 
And desires she's kept hidden inside make her tingle 
Yeah she knows why she lies 

Thrills in the night, far from the light, passion taking over 
Prices she pays, all through the days, no on really knows her
