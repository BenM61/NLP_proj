Push me aside when the day ends and my light is gone
Put me aside for a lifetime, put my lifeline so you feel you've won
I know I make look opaque
I may look like I've made way too many mistakes

I, I know the fire has burnt out
Know I gotta leave now
If a love was easy
If there was an endless sanity that I could hold on to
When I touch you
Hold on to

Love is blind when the lights go out
Can't see the shadows flowing
Can't see the curtains closing and I'm telling you
Love is blind when the lights go out
In a shattered sky we're one star down

Pull me close in the sunset when the light is turned on
Pull me aside, am I ready yet, for the heaviness
It's getting darker now
I know I may look a little dazed
Burn on the edge, acting like it phases me

I know the fire has burnt out
Now I gotta leave now
If a love was easy
If the walls an endless entity that I could hold on to
When I touch you
Hold on to

Love is blind when the lights go out
Can't see the shadows flowing
Can't see the curtains closing and I'm telling you
Love is blind when the lights go out
In a shattered sky we're one star down

Taking the air from the room
Strumming on words that you don't say
Gone is the person you knew
You never loved me anyway

Love is blind when the lights go out
Can't see the shadows flowing
Can't see the curtains closing and I'm telling you
Love is blind when the lights go out
Love is blind when the lights go out (I'm losing you)
Can't see the shadows flowing
Can't see the curtains closing and I'm telling you
Love is blind when the lights go out (losing you)
In a shattered sky we're one star down (losing you)
