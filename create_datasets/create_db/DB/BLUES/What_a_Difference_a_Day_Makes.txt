What a difference a day makes
Twenty four little hours
From the sun and the flowers
Where there use to be rain.
My yesterday was blue dear
Today I'm a part of you dear.
My lonely nights are through dear
Since you said you were mine.

What a difference a day makes
There's a rainbow before me.
Skies now blues once were stormy
Just before I missed that thrilling.
And don't know when you
Find romance on your menu
What a difference a day makes.
And that difference is you
