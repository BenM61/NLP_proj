Do you know the feeling
When sometimes you wake up young, and sometimes you wake up old
And sometimes you're so in love
And Do you know the feeling
When their love just comes undone
And I can't figure it out
What something's got me unlock, but you my baby

There were some times I put up a fight
But when something is right, you know that is right
And I don't wanna think, it's simple to me, you're the one

And baby that's why

And I can't help it, I gotta be where you are
Like the sky holding the stars
Like the strings on my guitar
I wanna be where you are
Like the sand that's on the beach
Like a model in a magazine
It don't mean a thing, if we're apart
I wanna be where you are
Where you are, where you are
And that's it baby I wanna be where you are

And baby every time you're around
You're the one that always holds me down
And don't even ask for a thing, no
You make a real win, even when things ain't perfect
You're the one that keeps the fire burning
And that's the reason why, I ain't leaving

And I can't help it, I gotta be where you are
Like the sky holding the stars
Like the strings on my guitar
I wanna be where you are
Like the sand that's on the beach
Like a model in a magazine
It don't mean a thing, if we're apart
I wanna be where you are
Where you are, where you are
And that's it baby I wanna be where you are

Yeah yeah yeah
I wanna be with you
Yeah yeah yeah
Baby I wanna be with you
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah babe
I gotta be, I gotta be with you baby

And I can't help it, I gotta be where you are
Like the sky holding the stars
Like the strings on my guitar
I wanna be where you are
Like the sand that's on the beach
Like a model in a magazine
It don't mean a thing, if we're apart
I wanna be where you are
Where you are, where you are
Said I wanna be where you are
