Nothin' 'round here to me that's sacred
'Cept you, yeah you
Nothin' 'round here to me that matters
'Cept you, yeah you

You're the one that reaches me
You're the one that I admire
Every time we meet together
I feel like I'm on fire
Nothin' matters to me
And there is nothin' I desire
'Cept you, yeah you

Nothin' 'round here I care to try for
'Cept you, yeah you
Got nothin' here to live or die for
'Cept you, yeah you

As a kid I'd hear it
In the churches all the time
Make me feel so good inside
So peaceful, so sublime
Now nothin' does remind me
Of that old familiar chime
'Cept you, yeah you

Used to run in the cemetery
Dance and run and sing when I was a child
And it never seemed strange
Now I just pass mournfully by
That place where the bones of life are piled
I know something has changed
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me
'Cept you, yeah you

Nothin' anymore seems to please me
'Cept you, yeah you
Your love hypnotizes me
It holds me in its spell
Everything runs by me
Just like water from a well
Everybody wants my attention
Everybody's got something to sell
'Cept you, yeah you
I'm in love with you

I'm in love with you
