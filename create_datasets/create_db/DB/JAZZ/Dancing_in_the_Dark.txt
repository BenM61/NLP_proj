Dancing in the dark,
'Til the tune end
We're dancing in the dark,
And it soon ends.

We're waltzing in the wonder
Of why we're here,
Time hurries by,
We're here and gone.

Looking for the light
Of a new love
To brighten up the night.
I have you to love,

And we can face the music together;
Dancing in the dark.
What though love is old?
What though song is old?

Through them we can be young.
Hear this heart of mine
Make yours part of mine.
Dear one, tell me that we're one!

Dancing in the dark!
