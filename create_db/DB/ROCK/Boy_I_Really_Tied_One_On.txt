Boy I really tied one on 
Spent the night away from home 
I know you're not to blame 
If I can't recall your name 
And I'm sorry if it causes you pain 
Boy I really lost my head 
I woke up in a double bed 
Allow me the pleasure 
Of taking your measure 
Though I'm sure you ain't 
Nobody's treasure 
And I know it isn't ladylike 
To do what I've done tonight 

Wake up I've got news for you 
Nobody's knocking at your door 
Nobody's gonna pull you through 
Nobody needs you anymore, yeah yeah 
Nobody's knocking at your door 

Boy I went around the bend 
Thought I'd made a lifelong friend 
Imagine my surprise 
When I looked into your eyes 
And saw the kind of friends 
You meant 
I think I'm gonna take the cure 
I'm going on the wagon for sure 
I may feel a fool 
For a Sunday or two 
But it's better than a Sunday with you 
And I know it isn't ladylike 
To do what I've done tonight 

Wake up I've got news for you 
Nobody's knocking at your door 
Nobody's gonna pull you through 
Nobody needs you anymore, yeah yeah 
Nobody's knocking at your door
