Behind your disguise
I see in your eyes
Something has left you wounded
I don't have the answers
For all of your tears
But you're not abandoned here

He knows where you are
He's been there too
When you can't go on
Hell carry you through
When your loosing hope
He's still in control
He's never letting go

So the damage is done
You try to move on
Still your empty handed
But this isn't your home
I want you to know
You don't walk alone

Of your situation
In the face of the unknown
He's right there
Look deep into your heart
For his reflection and
Don't let go please don't let go

I don't have the answers
For all of your tears
But you're not abandoned here
