Give a little sigh, give a little something
My mind's only said a one thing; I need you in my life
I want it so bad baby I can taste it, gotta chance I don't want to waste it
I want to do it right

Before you love me (before you love me)
There's something that your heart should know (yeah, your heart should know)
If you want me, it's body, sex, mind and soul
Yeah, I want it all

All you need, body's still shakin'
No fears, only hearts breakin'
I'm about to lose control, last night when I saw you leavin'
My eyes couldn't stop believin', did you have to go?

Before you love me (before you love me)
There's something that your heart should know (yeah, your heart should know)
If you want me, it's body, sex, mind and soul
Yeah, I want it all

Before you love me (before you love me)
There's something that your heart should know (yeah, your heart should know)
If you want me, it's body, sex, mind and soul
Yeah, I want it all

I want it so bad baby I can taste it

I want a nothing love

Before you love me (before you love me)
There's something that your heart should know (yeah, your heart should know)
If you want me, it's body, sex, mind and soul
Yeah, I want it all
