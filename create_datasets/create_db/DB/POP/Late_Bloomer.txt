It's just a stone's throw
From here to eternity
From the back roads
To where I long to be
The world has changed
Leaving only the truth intact
You think it's a game
To me it means more than that

But I'm a late bloomer
I'm a slow learner
And I've turned the record over
I'm a long player
My song is my saviour
I've got to raise it up
As far as my spirit can reach
That everyone might see

Within earshot
Of rose-coloured dreamers at best
I don't mean to eavesdrop
It's just part of my job I guess
At one glance
They don't know the truth by half
How announcing your plans
Is a sure way to hear god laugh

Like a crab apple on the tree
They'll find life more bitter than sweet

But I'm a late bloomer
I'm a slow learner
And I've heard the penny drop
I'm a small player
With a tall order
To come out on top
And without selling my soul
That everyone might know
That I'm a late bloomer

From a turntable to a phone
From a revolution to a ring tone

I'm a late bloomer
I'm a slow learner
And I've turned the record over
I'm a long player
My song is my saviour
Got to raise it up

I'm a late bloomer
I'm a slow learner
And I've heard the penny drop
I'm a small player
With a tall order
To come out on top
And without selling my soul
That's how a flower grows
And I'm a late bloomer
I'm a late bloomer
I'm a late bloomer
