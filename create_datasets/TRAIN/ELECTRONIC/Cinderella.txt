Cinderella are you really that happy?
Cinderella are you really that lucky?
I want to know is your life like you dreamed?

Here I am, trying to find my way,
I've kissed so many frogs but I never found a prince.
I think they lied, I was promised much more than this,
where's my happy ever after? Oh...

Cinderella is the queen of a kingdom,
Cinderella got the dreams she was dreaming,
I want to know where is my happy end?
Cinderella got a prince and a kingdom,
Cinderella got the dreams she was dreaming,
I want to know where is my fairy-tale?

Something's wrong 'cause all my glass shoes break,
and no one has ever helped this damsel in distress,
the hell with this, I'm not gonna waste more time,
I won't wait to find prince charming!
