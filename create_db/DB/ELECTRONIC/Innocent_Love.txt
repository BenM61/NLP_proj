Innocent love
You need my innocent love
My innocent love tonight
You can't get enough
You can stay by my side
An' give me everything
Innocent boy
You need me, innocent boy
My innocent boy tonight

You can stay by my side
An' show me everything

He's not in love, he's playin' just a game

Don't want to let him drown my ecstasy
