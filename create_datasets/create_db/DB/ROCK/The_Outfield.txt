I wanna lover, I wanna lover, I can't control
You left me waiting, you left me waiting out in the cold
I know you try so hard to be so hard to get
But I can hear the way you talk under your breath
I wanna lover, I wanna lover, I can't avoid
I see your picture, I see your picture with other boys
The only one, the only that gives me hell
Sometimes it feels like I'm just talking to myself

Far away
You got me standing in the outfield
By the way
Sometimes it's almost like you're not real
I always swore that I would get to you some day
I'm getting closer, but I'm still so far away
You got me standing in the outfield

I wanna touch you, I wanna touch you, I lose control
I don't want another, don't want another, I need your soul
Tonight, just another toy left on the floor
Sometimes I feel like walking up to your front door, yeah, but I'm so

Far away
You got me standing in the outfield
By the way
Sometimes it's almost like you're not real
I always swore that I would get to you some day
I'm getting closer, but I'm still so far away
You got me standing in the outfield

You know I want you, do you wanna let me on you?
If you wanna tell me why you gotta be so hard to get
You know I want you, do you wanna let me on you?
If you wanna tell me why you gotta be so hard to get

Far away
You got me standing in the outfield
By the way
Sometimes it's almost like you're not real
I always swore that I would get to you some day
I'm getting closer, but I'm still so far away
You got me standing in the outfield

You know I want you, do you wanna let me on you?
If you wanna tell me why you gotta be so hard to get
You know I want you, do you wanna let me on you?
If you wanna tell me why you gotta be so hard to get
