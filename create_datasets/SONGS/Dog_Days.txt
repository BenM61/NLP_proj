Paper fans in sweaty fans
Shooing flies away
Reflections on a porch
A shelter from the scorch
When dog days came around

Babies squalled
As August crawled
Past old folks in the shade
The weather vane was stuck
And white oak creek would drop
When dog days came around

The dog days were scorchers
Southern torture
But we found an
Answer to the plight
It was a dog day's night

Evening brings
The front porch scene
A time ro tesr your bones
Thank you for using Top40db.com.
I pray you won't be here
Come this time next tear
When dog days come along

The dog days were scorchers
Southern torture
But we found an
Answer to the plight
It was a dog day's night

The dog days were scorchers
It was southern torture
But we found an
Answer to the plight
It was a dog day's night

Oh, yeah

More dog days
Oh, yeah
