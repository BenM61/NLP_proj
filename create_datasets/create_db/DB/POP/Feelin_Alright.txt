Its early in the morning and I'm feeling kind of dumb,
I'm tryin real hard but I'm having no fun,
I'm looking all around and everything looks the same,
Its like being the smartest kid in class and having no brain.

Sharons right beside me,
Yeah I feel it too. and if you weren't my little brother id take it out on you,
And d-rock and moves just lost their fat-mad flow,
Its just a matter of time before my brains all broke.

My brains all broken, but I'm feelin alright,
I feel like I'm chokin, but I'm feelin alright,
I'm goin down fast, but I'm feelin alright,
I'm not gonna last, but I'm feelin alright.
Feelin alright.

Bad days are givin me the creeps,
And when I have them all I want to do is freak,
And sometimes I don't feel really strong
Enough to deal with bad days cause they last too long.

We've been thinking hard and figuring out what to make
Of all this stupid shit that makes you not think straight,
So should we just quit?
No, its not cool to run,
Well you know, I think she's right,
Lets show em how its done.

Cause its not just a matter of straight up holding your ground,
Its all about your crew and the vibe you put down,
So if were all here, what's this about a bad day?
Were not going to take it sitting down, no way.

My brains all broken, but I'm feelin alright,
