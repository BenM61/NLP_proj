No one heard you say your prayers ... for love
No one ever seemed to care ... for you
Blind as you run
Aware
You were staring at the sun

Always someone's favorite fool ... playing
Games that they'd invent for you ... losing
Your heart and soul
Aware
There's no way you can repair yourself

Your fragile face reflects
Years of neglect
Love for so long denied
Dies in your eyes
And so you kiss and give
Your heart away

Far from the start
You knew
There was something out of view

Like a burning spear of stars ... falling
You dissolve the night in tears ... so tired
Blinded you run
Aware
You were staring at the sun

You've given it all away
No more prayers today
You got a homeless heart
That's tearing you apart
You couldn't feel more cold
Inside your secret soul
You never found no one
You were staring at the sun
(staring at the sun)
(staring at the sun)
