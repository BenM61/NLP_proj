What I did here
Is in the past
How could we see
We'd never last

And time will tell
And you're all eyes 
And now the truth
Is your demise

All my heart
All of your tears
Our whole world
Is smoke and mirrors

All my heart
All of your tears
Our whole world
Is smoke and mirrors

You're here yourself 
In wandered eyes
But now I've seen
Through your disguise
From where I stand
A lovely view
Your world unwinds
You come unglued

All my heart
All of your tears
Our whole world
Is smoke and mirrors

All my heart
All of your tears
Our whole world
Is smoke and mirrors
