Hey
O yea
Oh no, yea
O yea
I bring you flowers
In a tiny bottle of rain
I bring out demons
That you cannot explain
I bring you thunder
That will wake up the sky
Shakin' like a go-go
And I don't know why
I bring you wisdom
What do fools think of me?
I am your prison
When you long to be free
I bring you laughter
From a serious guy
Still nervous like a school boy
And I don't know why...
(A little love) will make it alright
A little love will make your heart
Go bang-bang
(A little love) sky-rocket the night
(A little love), a little love, a little love
A little bit 'o love, say
(Sha la la la)
(Sha la la la)
(Sha la la la)
(Sha la la la)
Oh
You bring me oceans
When the river runs dry
Magic potion for my ethereal side
Carry Gibraltar like
A pebble from the beach
Sister is your secret simply out of reach?
(A little love) will make it alright
A little love will make you heart
Go bang-bang
(A little love) sky-rocket the night
(A little love,) a little love, a little love
A little bit 'o love..., yea
Oh baby
Oh a little closer now
Say oh baby
Oh a little closer now
Na na, na, yea
(Sha la la la)
(Sha la la la)
(Sha la la la)
(Sha la la la)
A little bit of love, oh yeah
Oh yeah
Here we go
A little love will make it alright
A little love will make you heart
Go (bang-bang)
(A little love) sky-rocket the night
A little love
(Give me all your love)
Shut up
A little love will make it alright
A little love will make you heart
Go bang-bang
A little love sky-rocket the night
A little love
One more time
(Sha la la la)
(Sha la la la)
Oh
(Sha la la la)
(Sha la la la)
Oh yea
Oh give me all your love.
