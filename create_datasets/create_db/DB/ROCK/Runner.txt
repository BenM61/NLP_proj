To give yourself a little bit of hope's a lie
You said, we're just spinning where we stand
And if you cling to tokens for your life you find
You wind up with imaginary men

Static transmit me
To the other side of another room in pieces
Like a steady beating
The summer hurts
The summer hurts 
The summer hurts 
The summer hurts 
The summer hurts 

The telescopic pull of what you know's a lie
It's broken down a hundred thousand times
The parts collapse in caving they're inside the atmosphere
We're carving out our names into the air

You are a runner, the steady balance as you're gaining in speed
A photograph to scale the thrashing of your feet
And it won't be over until the big, backhand of the sun
Beats the tar out of the road you are on until it's won you
The summer hurts
The summer hurts 
The summer hurts 
The summer hurts 
The summer hurts 
The summer hurts 

And as for all your suffering, you won't escape
The sting until you're buried in the ground
The beauty that you breathe into the air won't clear your name
You have been sinning since the day you came around

You are a runner, the steady balance as you're gaining in speed
A photograph to scale the thrashing of your feet
And it won't be over until the big, backhand of the sun
Beats the tar out of the road you are on until it's won you
The summer hurts
The summer hurts 
The summer hurts 
The summer hurts 
The summer hurts 
The summer hurts 
The summer hurts 
The summer hurts 
The summer hurts 
The summer hurts 
The summer hurts 
The summer hurts 
The summer hurts 
The summer hurts 
The summer hurts 
The summer hurts 
The summer hurts
