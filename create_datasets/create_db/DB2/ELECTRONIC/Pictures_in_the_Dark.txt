Follow the light that glows
Through your bedroom window.
Tonight, tonight, the fading twilight.
There's a hollow deep in the woods
Where you know you're crazy
To go, to go, not even meant to know
There are...

Pictures in the dark, I see all around.
Voices calling underground
And I'm watching the stars since the
World was found.

One, two, three.
Pictures in the dark, I see
Morpheus comes to me.
Pictures in the dark, I see.
Aurora sets you free.

And in the deepest dark
You come to a maze in.
The night, the night, the fading twilight.
And you shiver the glistening path
Where you know you're crazy
To go, to go, not even meant to know.
There are...

Pictures in the dark, I see all around.
Voices calling underground
And I'm watching the stars since the
World was found.

One, two, three.
Lost in my dreams.
This night will never end.
You can only fly in your dreams.
Midnight will be your friend.
Drift away on starlight beams.
Clocks are ticking the night away.
You can only fly until dawn ascends.

Pictures in the dark, I see all around.
Voices calling underground
And I'm watching the stars since the
World was found.

Pictures in the dark I see,
Aurora sets you free

Holding a fantasy that changes you a way through the door,
The door (and) through the day is born
As the sunlight shines through the window,
will you remember the night,
The night, that crazy starlight
There are...
Pictures in the dark,
see all around

Pictures in the dark, I see all around.
Voices calling underground
And I'm watching the stars since the
World was found.

The moon shines starlight beams
And you'll be flying in your dreams.

Pictures in the dark, I see all around.
Voices calling underground
And I'm watching the stars since the
World was found.
