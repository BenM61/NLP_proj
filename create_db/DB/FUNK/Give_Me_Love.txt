I got money
I got cars
So I don't need it
I need more
I'll show you mine
If you show me yours
You best believe it
I got what you want

Hey, no holding back
Ain't no holding back
I need all of your attention
All of your attention baby
Turn me on
Turn the whole world off
Boy I need you at attention
Need you at attention baby

Give me love or nothing at all
Give me love or nothing at all
Give me love or nothing at all
Give me love or nothing at all
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give me love
Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me
Give me love
Give me love or nothing at all
Give me love or nothing at all

We ain't gon' make it
The bed too far
So let's go now
Right here on the floor
Body to body
We can bury it all
Yeah the naked truth
Ooh if these walls could talk

Hey, no holding back
Ain't no holding back
I need all of your attention
All of your attention baby
Turn me on
Turn the whole world off
Boy I need you at attention
I need you at attention baby

Give me love or nothing at all
Give me love or nothing at all
Give me love or nothing at all
Give me love or nothing at all
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give me love
Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me
Give me love
Give me love or nothing at all
Give me love or nothing at all

We just begun, the night is young
Oh will you take me there
Oh come and hold me, won't you show me
You can take me there
My body's callin' for you darling
Hope that you're prepared
To take my body where nobody's ever taken me
Me, me, me, me

Give me love or nothing at all
Give me love or nothing at all
Give me love or nothing at all
Give me love or nothing at all
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give me love
Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me
Give me love
Give me love or nothing at all
Give me love or nothing at all
