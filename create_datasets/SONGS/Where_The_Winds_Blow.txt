Gotta travel through rain and snow
And follow the trail where the mountains grow
Where the winds blow
Where the winds blow 

Maybe I'll ride over yonder
Maybe I'll hide maybe I'll wonder
Gotta have time just to ponder
My soul
Maybe I'll go
Where the winds blow 

Sherriff is riding behind me
Thinkin that he's goin to find me
To the live oak he will find me I know
Danglin low 
Where the winds blow

Keep a movin on your darned old charley horse 
Take me to the hills
You gotta be ridin a two gunfight
Or push up the daffodils

But if you beat him to the draw
You gotta get shot or break the law
Keep a movin on your darned old charley horse
Where the winds may blow 

Maybe my gal knows my sorrow
Maybe I'll see her tomorrow
Gotta have time I can borrow
But no
Can't let her go 
Where the winds blow

Wonder if she's thinkin of me
Watchin the same stars above me
How can I ask her to love me and go
Where the winds blow
Where the winds blow

Gotta travel through rain and snow
And follow the trail where the mountains grow
Where the winds blow
Where the winds blow
Where the winds blow
