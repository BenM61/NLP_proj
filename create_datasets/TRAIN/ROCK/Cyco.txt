Cyco cyco cyco cyco
Cyco cyco cyco cyco
Born cyco it's the way I was meant to be
Live cyco it's the only life for me

Burning burning burning burning
Burning burning burning burning
Burning up can't you see
But it's the only life for me

I'm burning up, the fire blazes inside
Out of control, so now you better hide
Run around the corner
But the corner never ends
You scream out, beg, shout
But the nightmare never ends
You turn around but you just see
What you saw before
Spin around, fall down
Now you see no more

Raging raging raging raging
Raging raging raging raging
Raging mad that may be
But it's the only life for me

I'm raging mad and soon you will know
I'm burning up from my head to toe

Cyco cyco cyco cyco
Cyco cyco cyco cyco
It's the only life I know
I was born to cyco

I'm cyco and my mind it starts to bend
Out of control, it seems to be the trend

Born to be cyco
