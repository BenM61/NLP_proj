Hey all you low riders that cruise the street 
We've got one bad rap that can't be beat 
With a beat that will blow our b-o-y Heads 
Just give us a beat and we'll pass the test 
We're gonna make you down from your head to your toes, 
Turn up the stereos and here we go

Now early one day I got the urge to drive 
So I took my moms car for a joyride 
The ride was so sweet, the noise so chill, 
The time that night came I cruised it again

When the next day came I was all alone 
Just thinkin' about a car I could call my own 
So early in the night I went to find 
A job so I wouldn't have to hustle, steal a ride 

So I got a little job at the grocery store, 
Packin' all those groceries, man what a bore 
But I just kept thinkin' how it would feel 
To be cruisin' down the street in my own set of wheels 

I saved up my money put it all in the bank 
And put some aside for my gas tank 
Now we're the poor boys here to make some noise
Tryin' to bring all the people some pride and joy
We're the last three brothers on the microphone 
Just cruisin' around where the beat my go 

I was gunnin' for work one Monday at three, 
Came down Van Buren and was lucky to see 
It was sittin' in the lot, it was all the way vibe
It was a cool old chevy, a sixty five! 

So I went into the lot and I asked the owner,
How much do you want for the car in the corner? 
He said one hundred and fifty is my price 
And then I took it for a ride and it rode real nice 

So I bought the car, a couple days later
I found a hole in the radiator 
I got that fixed for twenty five bills
And when I got more money and got me some wheels

They were classic, really fantastic,
Made my car look for real 
Just turned on the ignition, blow my sounds, 
Give all the girls a thrill 

Show your fun side as we're crusin' 
Now hold it right there, don't go,
Now let me see somebody do the jiggalow 
Jigga-shake, jigga-strut, 
Jigga-any kind of way but get off your butt 
See the party can't cruise if you don't wanna move, 
C'mon everybody get in the groove

Cruisin' is a thing today 
And you can cruise in any old way 
You can cruise on the bus, 
You can cruise in your car, 
You can cruise no matter how far 
You can cruise all day, 
You can cruise all night, 
You can cruise in the lane to the right 
You can cruise to your girl on the telephone,
You can cruise when you're all alone
You can cruise to the rhythm of the funky beat 
And you can cruise cause it sounds so sweet

Shake that girl, let's cruise 
Build it up from the groove 
How you gonna win if you think you're gonna lose? 
Gotta cruise in those dancin' shoes 

Now me and my fine lady took off for LA 
Cause they were havin' a car show the very next day
We got to LA It was a very hip town, 
A lot a party people were there gettin' down 

North, east, south, and west 
Low riders everywhere but mine was the best 
We entered the car show and took first place, 
Real happy that we came cause it wasn't a waste 

Got to the party, 
Everybody's groovin' 
The sound of hydraulics got everybody jumpin'
All the cars lined up against the wall but my car I won jumped four feet tall! 

Say Friday!
Friday!
Say Friday!
Friday!

Friday is the day that we get our pay 
I'm gonna call my girl, set up a date, 
Do all the chores early so I won't be late 
Gonna cash my check, see the money with my eyes,
Give my mom a little bit so she won't cry 

Gonna wash my car, lubricate my grill,
Then cruise across town to pick up my girl 
Gonna take her to the disco dance, yep it's on 
The fast, the slow, the struttin' along 
I'm gonna be GQ'd out, have her in gown,
Gonna be slippin' and slidin' yeah really gettin' down 

We're all low riders, that's who we are 
Some ride here, some ride far 
No matter how far some of us go, 
We're gonna drive our low riders very slow 

I bought a Lincoln Continental seventy nine,
Always shinin' it up, keepin' it lookin' real fine
Got it up in the front, drag low in the back, 
When I hit the switch I got it goin' whack! 

Got to do what I can with my paid job, 
Thursday's I do people say I'm done 
I keep the white lookin' great, 
Got the magic LA On my license plate 
Didn't buy no rims, just pop my hood, 
See that's what we prefer in our car club 
Gotta the sun roof popped and rear views tint 
And when you open my door all you can smell is peppermint 

As we cruise through the city got my music up loud
And every place we stop we seem to form a crowd
Keep my car dropped low, won't raise it any higher,
Want everyone to know that I'm a lowrider 

We're all low riders, that's who we are 
Some ride here, some ride far 
No matter how far some of us go, 
We're gonna drive our low riders very slow 

One plus two plus three is six, 
We're the poor boy rappers livin' in Phoenix 
We're gonna hip, gonna hop, gonna rap to the beat 
Til everyone around starts movin' their feet 
We could run, swim, walk, fly, dance, jump, turn around, 
Hey! We could really get down
