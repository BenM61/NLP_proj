Once I had a love of my own
But now she's left me sad and alone
She was the only girl for me. (Hey!)

Things were bright and gay
The world was going our way
Love was in our hearts
But now we're far apart
Love seems doomed.

We could have had a lifetime to share
But problems of young love were too much to bear
She was the one in a million for me.

Things were bright and gay
The world was going our way
Love was in our hearts
But now we're far apart
Love seems doomed.

Things were bright and gay
The world was going our way
Love was in our hearts
But now we're far apart
Love seems doomed.

Love seems doomed.

Love  se-e-e-ms  do-o-o-omed!
