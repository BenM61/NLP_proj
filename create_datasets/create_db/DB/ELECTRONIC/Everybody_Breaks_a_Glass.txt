It's not a solid, not a soft thing, to pull the wool up like a smoke screen
Nobody does it like a prophet, it's gone before you know you lost it
There are reasons you keep your hands tied, there's certain things you shouldn't have tried
So if you gotta tell me something, you better go from the beginning

We all forget to sleep, and crash at someone's feet
Everybody skips a beat
We let the chances pass, the few we held so fast
Everybody breaks a glass

And here I'm standing in the middle, not just a little but a hill full
Wondering how I got a head cold, wishing I didn't know what I know
It's never been about the money, we're worthy or we are not worthy
However much you got on your plate, you're as good as you reciprocate

We all pretend to keep our tongue out of our cheek
Everyone's the fool they seek
We all go off the track, and feel for our way back
Everybody breaks a glass
Everybody breaks a glass

Shook
Scared to look
At peers when they peer back
It's weird how we fear that

It's weird how we wear masks
It appears that we fear our own tears
More than tear gas
My team's struggling in years past

Looking to draft beers
To bring cheers back
But when the drinking game's finished
No Guinness just a clear glass

Seeing our real image mirrored back
The places that we go to cope
It's so strange
When we're older folks

It don't change
Trying to hang, we don't know the ropes
When we fall, we got more than our shoulders broke
It's no game

It's why we overdose on cocaine
Get our brains comatose, there's no blame
If you've ever know shame
Known pain

Known days when it really don't feel okay

Somewhere perfection lies, but not for you and I
Everybody trips some time
When cities fall like shacks, walls eventually crack
Everybody breaks a glass
