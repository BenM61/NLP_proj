I sense infliction in the air
It's only me
I'm fucking up old times
It's a remembrance

O this
Black session in my mind
O the black

I was too weak to fight
Once more I let go
It is a black session
An invitation of sorts

I keep on living in this my only wish
That life will be good someday
I keep on losing my sleep because of this
Seems so hard just to stay

So if you come by just this last time
I'll be here
And I will talk to you like
If this had never been

O this
Black session in my mind
O the black
