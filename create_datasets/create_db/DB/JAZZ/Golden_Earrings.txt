There's a story the gypsies know is true,
That when your love wears golden earrings he belongs to you

An old love story that's known to very few,
But if you wear these golden earrings, love will come to you

By the burning fire, they will glow with every coal

You will hear desire whisper low inside your soul

So be my gypsy, make love your guiding light,
And let this pair of golden earrings cast their spell tonight
