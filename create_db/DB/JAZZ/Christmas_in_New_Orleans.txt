Magnolia trees at night, sparkling bright
Fields of cotton look wintry white
When it's Christmas time in New Orleans

A barefoot choir in prayer fills the air
Mississippi folks gathering there
'Cause it's Christmas time in New Orleans

You'll see a Dixieland Santa Claus
Leading the band to a good old Creole beat
Golly, what a spirit, you can only hear it
Down on Basin Street

Your kids will disappear, when you hear
Hallelujah, St. Nicholas is here
When it's Christmas time in New Orleans

You'll see a Dixieland Santa Claus
A leading the band to a good, good old Creole beat
And golly, what a spirit and you can only hear it
A down on Basin Street

Your kids will disappear and when you hear
Hallelujah, old Santa is near
When it's Christmas time in New Orleans
Yes, when it's Christmas time
It's Christmas time in New Orleans
