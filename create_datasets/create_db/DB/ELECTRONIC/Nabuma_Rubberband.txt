Lurad!

The last bird
Smashed into a skyscraper
Under the Hong Kong lights
It fell (down?) like a (sink?)
Landed on the night drain
Fell (a strong right?)
While underground
The tunnel reveal
Voiceless land
The harder to (feel?)
For being born at the wrong place
At the wrong time
With a wrong fate

Rockets fall out
Laser, (color?)
(Sky now?)
Don't forget ice and all the (sights?)
Because you can
Blinded by the rubberbands
Blinded by the rubberbands
Blinded by the (love?)

Cigar smoke stretchin' over borders
Creepin' like silent thief
The bird (stares?)
(Sleeping?) like an icon
Make it fly, could rest in peace
Intelligent
(So fly?)
Can't think out loud
Cause now's the time
Don't lose your job
Starin' and smile
Can (?) left

Rockets fall out
Laser, (color?)
(Sky now?)
Don't forget ice and all the (sights?)
Because you can
Blinded by the rubberbands
Blinded by the rubberbands
Blinded by the (love?)

Rockets fall out
Laser, (color?)
(Sky now?)
Don't forget ice and all the (sights?)
Because you can
Blinded by the rubberbands
Blinded by the rubberbands
Blinded by the (love?)
