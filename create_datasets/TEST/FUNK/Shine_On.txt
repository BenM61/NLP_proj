Ooh, shiny eyes, you've broken down a wall
Reach for the skies, now I feel ten feet tall

The sun is shining on us, baby
Play that song so we can dance
Our love is shining on us, baby
Let's play the song so we can dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance

(Ooh, you make me feel so young)
Shine on, shine on, shine on
(Ooh, you make me feel so young)
Come on and shine on, shine on

Ooh, shiny eyes, we can have a ball
Reach for the skies, you make me ten feet tall

The sun is shining on us, baby
Let's sing the song and we can dance
Our love is shining on us, baby
Let's play the song so we can dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance

(Ooh, you make me feel so young)
Shine on, shine on, shine on
(Ooh, you make me feel so young)
I want you to shine on, shine on, shine on

Ooh, shiny eyes, we can have a ball
I want you to shine on, shine on
Ooh, shiny eyes, now I feel ten feet tall
Shine on, shine on, shine on

(Ooh, you make me feel so young)
Shine on, shine on, shine on
(Ooh, you make me feel so young)
Shine on
(Ooh, you make me feel so young)
Shine on
