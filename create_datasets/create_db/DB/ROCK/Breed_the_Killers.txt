Designed to deceive myths of supremacy. 
A climate ingrained of fear and disdain. Spawning murderers since
time began. Borders redefined, the aggressors rule. 
Demons have their day of every race in every land. Survivors of massacres
live on enslaved. One half of the world in five centuries has been under
European supremacist rule. Hatred forced into each
of all our minds. There's still time to set ourselves free.
Hatred forced into each of all our minds. There's still time to
set ourselves free. Architects of conspiracies created to subjugate.
Conquered peoples by believing their oppression is divine will.
Breed the killers of the lies. Unveil the truth throughout the past.
Until achievements are known.
Until inventions are known.
Until contributions are known humanity lives in lies.
Hatred forced into each of all our minds.
There's still time to set ourselves free. 
Hatred forced into each of all our minds.
There's still time to set ourselves free.
