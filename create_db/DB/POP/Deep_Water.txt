We used to go down to the beach at night,
Fireflies dancing in the promenade lights,
Oh those rock 'n roll bands used to really swing,
And I'd do the foxtrot with sweet Christine,
She'd speak to me with her gentle hands,
And we'd fly on down to Wonderland;

[Chorus]
Deep Water I'm caught up in it's flow,
If I'm in over my head, I'd be the last to know
Deep Water.

They closed down the doors of the Trocadero,
And I came back looking just like a ghost,
The posters are scattered all over the stairs,
Nobody reads them so nobody cares,
The kids all retired when they reached twenty-one,
But that really just ain't my idea of fun.

[Chorus]

Sitting out on the Palm Beach Road,
I'm so drunk and the car won't go,
And my crazy eyes keep looking out to sea,

The Sunday drivers are cruising round,
I wish they'd all go back to town,
What do they expect to find,
Sure as hell ain't peace of mind.
