Don't, don't, don't, don't leave me
Don't leave me here
Skirt in the air with muted cares
All limbs and love absurd

I know I say just let me stay
But stomp the ground, push me around
And send me on my way

No, no, no, don't leave me
Don't take my word
I've lost my head, I need my bed
I promise you my bird

When I awake all sweet and sound
Without a care or woe
I'll thank you, dear, I'll kiss you, love
No matter friend or foe

I want to be the best I can
For me, for you, for every man
But I can slip, I lose my place
This shamefulness is hard to face

No, no, no, don't tell me
Of what I've done
I might ignore, just close the door
Before you have your fun

You tell it with such grace and wit
I know it can be humorous
But I don't have the heart for it

Oh, oh, oh, don't look
I've lost my way
I'll button up, hold out my cup
And beg for a cliche

I have no rights to a complaint
I guess it's just a little nuts
We're all a bit insane

I want to be the best I can
For me, for you, for every man
But I can slip, I lose my place
This shamefulness is hard to face

Oh, please let me
Keep my head
It wouldn't do you any good
Just hanging by a thread

I want to be the best I can
Nose to the ground
It's pound for pound
Or stick it to the man

I want to be the best I can
For me, for you, for every man
But I can slip, I lose my place
This shamefulness is hard to face

I want to be the best I can
For me, for you, for every man
But I can slip, I lose my place
This shamefulness is hard to face
