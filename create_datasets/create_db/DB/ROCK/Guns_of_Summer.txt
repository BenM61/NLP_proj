If this is my last chance, keep me
I don't need to go
You're better off without the misunderstanding
If I am displeasing, then leave me
a reason to what I want
Would I truly care if the truth would mean nothing?

Oh, have you been that crazy
or will the curtains save me?
Oh, my final call

No one will save us
You think that somebody cares
why the water is rising up?
Let the cleansing begin
Mother will they ever thank you?
Instead we hide behind these foolish lies
The teachers have told us otherwise

Cold as winter's guns of summer
Boy, watch them run
Summer is willing to breathe in the sun
This is your last chance, will you get out?

But in my turning towards the new
it is regarded in this old way
Will we face the truth or suffer again?

Now we have to break in the shower of souls
Rain down fire, burn us all!

No one will save us
Do you think that somebody cares
why the water is rising up?
Let the cleansing begin
Mother will they ever thank you?
Instead we hide behind these foolish lies
The teachers have told us other wise

Cold as winter's guns of summer
Boy, watch him run
Summer's willing to breathe in the sun
This is your last chance, will you get out?

Cold as winter's guns of summer
Boy, watch them run
Summer is willing to breathe in the sun
This is your last chance, will you give and run?
Summer is willing to breathe in the sun
This is your last chance, this is your last chance

(Cold as winter's guns) This is your last chance, will you give?
(Cold as winter's guns) This is your last chance, will you?
(Cold, cold) This is your last chance, will you give?
(as winter's guns) This is your last chance, will you?
