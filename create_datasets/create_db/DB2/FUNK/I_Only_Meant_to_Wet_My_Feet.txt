Girl, how was I to know
When I first met you
All the changes I'd be going through
As helpless as a bird
Caught in your hurricane
And falling into your love I came, mmm hmm

Cause when I first met you
I felt there'd be a change
That if I tried your sweet love, baby
My life will never be the same, oh, oh

I said I only meant just to wet my feet
But you pulled me in where all the waters of love run deep
Oh, this good feeling must have been sent from above
Cause you've got me walking on wall to wall love
Oh, you got me walking

Givin' you, baby, my all and all
Sitting and waiting for your call
As helpless as a bird caught in your hurricane
And falling into your love I came, oh, oh

I said, I said I only meant just to wet my feet
But you pulled me in where all the waters of love run deep
Oh, this good feeling must have been sent from above
Cause you've got me walking on wall to wall love
Oh, you got me walking

I said I only meant just to wet my feet
But you pulled me in where all the waters of love run deep
Oh, this good feeling
