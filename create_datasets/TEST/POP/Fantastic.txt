I've got a friend who's not really my friend
But I know him just like everybody does
He's got the shoes and he's got the accent
He's got the style and he's always so fantastic
Refrain:
Move on move on move on stupid pop kid
Can't stand your face because you all look the same
Move on move on move on stupid pop kid
Can't stand your songs because
They mean nothing to me
I've got a friend who's not really my friend
But I hate him just like everybody does
He's got the scooter he's got the haircut
He's got the eyeballs - he's always so fantastic
Refrain
If you want to be unusual
You should listen to yourself
If you want to be all different
You should get out of bed
If you want to be so famous
You should listen to yourself
