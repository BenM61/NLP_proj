My baby
Sexy Cinderella
Its almost midnight
And I've been dieing to kiss you under the moonlight
Sexy Cinderella
Theres no need to run away
Girl I'm begging you please wont you stay

I've only just met ya
Feels though I've known you for a life time
Tell me do you feel like I do
I really wanna get ya
You came along at just tha right time
I get a blue sensation with you

Sexy Cinderella
Its almost midnight
And I've been dieing to kiss you under the moonlight
Sexy Cinderella
There's no need to run away
Girl I'm begging you please wont you stay

Cold flashes
Up and down my body
I've got nothing that I won't do right
Flicking her lashes
Drives me crazy
I get a strange warm feeling inside

Sexy Cinderella

I see planets in your eyes babe(you and I)
Filled with clear blue skys (you and I)
