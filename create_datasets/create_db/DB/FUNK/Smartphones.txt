She picks up the phone
In my head I know I'm wrong
I just want to know what she's heard
I'm pacing back and forth
'Cause I know that I've been caught
Trying to think of the perfect words

So I can come to her and lie right to her face
I don't know what I'm gonna say
But I know that I'm gonna say
Whatever it takes
I'mma run to her and lie right to her face
I don't know what I'm gonna say
But I know that I'm gonna say
Whatever it takes

Time is not on our side
'Cause she's waving goodbye goodbye
'Cause she's waving goodbye goodbye
Smarts phones, dumb shit

Never knew I call so if she heard it all
I'm all out of luck tonight
I can say it was a joke but who am I kidding she ain't slow
Only way to make it right

Is if I come to her and lie right to her face
I don't know what I'm gonna say
But I know that I'm gonna say
Whatever it takes
I'mma run to her and lie right to her face
I don't know what I'm gonna say
But I know that I'm gonna say
Whatever it takes

Oh man I got to think of something
I'm about to lose it all
I swear that shit really didn't mean nothing
It all started with a pocket call

So I'mma run to her and lie right to her face
I don't know what I'm gonna say
But I know that I'm gonna say
Whatever it takes
I'mma run to her and lie right to her face
I don't know what I'm gonna say
But I know that I'm gonna say
Whatever it takes

Time is not on our side
'Cause she's waving goodbye goodbye
She's waving goodbye goodbye
Smart phones, dumb shit
