I've been gone awhile away from you
And I hope you overstand
That I've got to do what I must do
To be a better man
Cuz if I was to just to act a fool
Do nothing with myself
Then all my blessings would be cursed
My world would crumble in
It's a joy when I sit down and
Think of the good times that we have
And what we do to make it through
When the good turns to the bad
Well I hope you'll find it in your heart
And know these words are true
And please don't fuss
Because I must go do what I must do

Hey baby don't you worry
Even though the road is rocky
I'll be coming home to you again
Cuz if you thought that I was lost
I had to bare my cross
Now I'm free from all these Chains

A time, a space, a different place
How perfect we might be
I would be the wind that blows
You'd be that willow tree
And I could never bare the thought of you not by my side
So I would be the warmth of day
You'd be the cool of night
And everyday I pray to Jah that one day you will see
And overstand the fact I must fulfill my destiny

I hope you'll find it in your heart and know these words are true
And please don't cry
Cuz you know that I must do what I must do

Well and it's not easy
Jah knows how I try, I try
So don't you get weary
Jah knows how I try, I try

God knows
Life is one big road
With alot of signs and turns & twists and curves
Even though the road is rocky
My main thing's to rock and keep on rockin'
From city to city
Backyard to yard
And we be seein' the sights, standin' under the lights
And the spot is hot, it's cold and lonely at night
And I'm feenin' and I'm dreamin' and I'm holding you tight
But hold on, every single road I roll on
Comes to an end and I'm back home again
So baby please don't cry, there's no valley low and there's no mountain high
And our love don't die with the passage of time
It just grows more,
And just keep strong
And even though I'm gone, I am never too far
You're the light through the dark, shining right through my heart
So my journey must start
