Yeah, talking 'bout a real friend
Set your mind at ease baby
Ain't nothing wrong with that

I guess we both have seen some brighter days
Somehow the love we shared, has slipped away
Still I want to be the one who keeps you safe and warm
Let me be the one

Although things with me and you didn't quite work out
For you there's this special place deep in my heart
Though I want it X'ed in my unconditional love
Let me be the one

If you need a friend
Let me be the one
Someone that you call
Want to be the one
The one through it all
You don't have to fall
Just let me be the one
Let me be the one

Promises made they've all worn paper thin
Still honey I'm not afraid to call you friend
Take a look and I know you'll see the possibilities
Let me be the one

To see you smile, there's nothing I won't do
Cause honey I only want what's best for you
You are a shining star, just stay the way you are
Let me be the one

If you need a friend
Let me be the one
Someone that you call
Want to be the one
The one through it all
You don't have to fall
Just let me be the one
Let me be the one

If you need a friend
Let me be the one
Someone that you call
Want to be the one
The one through it all
You don't have to fall
Just let me be the one
Let me be the one

Let me be
I want to be the one you need
Let me set your mind at ease
Nothing wrong with being a friend
Want to be there till the end
I want to be the one you need
Let me set your mind at ease
Nothing wrong with being a friend
Want to be there till the end

Just let me be the one, let me be the one baby
Just let me be the one
