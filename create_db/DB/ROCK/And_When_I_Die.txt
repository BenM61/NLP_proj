I'm not scared of dying 
And I don't really care
If it's peace you find in dying, 
Well, then let the time be near

If it's peace you find in dying, 
And if dying time is here, 
Just bundle up my coffin cause 
It's cold way down there, 
I hear that's it's cold way down there,
Yeah, crazy cold way down there

And when I die and when I'm gone, 
There'll be one child born 
In this world to carry on, to carry on

Now troubles are many, 
They're as deep as a well
I can swear there ain't no heaven 
But I pray there ain't no hell

Swear there ain't no heaven 
And pray there ain't no hell, 
But I'll never know by living, 
Only my dying will tell, 
Only my dying will tell, yeah, 
Only my dying will tell

And when I die and when I'm gone, 
There'll be one child born 
In this world to carry on, to carry on

Give me my freedom for as long as I be
All I ask of living is to have no chains on me 

All I ask of living is to have no chains on me, 
And all I ask of dying is to go naturally, 
Only want to go naturally

Here I go, ah

Here comes the devil, right behind
Look out children, here he come
Here he come

Don't want to go by the devil, 
Don't want to go by the demon, 
Don't want to go by Satan, 
Don't want to die uneasy,
Just let me go naturally

And when I die and when I'm dead, dead and gone, 
There'll be one child born,
In our world to carry on, to carry on
