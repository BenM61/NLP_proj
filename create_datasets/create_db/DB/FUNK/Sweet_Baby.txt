1. When I think about your lovin'
The sunday evenings, the fun we use to share
Looking through the memories in my mind
Since I've laughed and cried and thought it over
Now I realize that it's never over only set aside

chorus:
Oh it's you sweet baby
I will never be free from your embrace
Sweet baby
Only hopin' it's not too late to try again
It's you sweet baby
Ever always been captured by your smile, sweet baby
I will always be right there by your side
Right by your side

2. Lyin' here alone I'm dreamin'
My mind keeps wanderin' why
My thoughts are only you
Wanderin' through the memories in myy mind
How could love so real have gone so empty
I just keep wanderin' why
Well I ever find the love we share

3. Oh it's you sweet baby
Though we've had such a long hard road to climb, sweet baby
Only hopin' it's not too late to try again
It's you, sweet baby
Won't you try and believe in what I say, sweet baby
I will always be right there by your sided, right by your side
(chorus)
