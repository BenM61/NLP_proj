Time is ticking away
Your chance will come along someday
Even though you feel like sinking
That's just keeps sending around

When you feel like you're sinking
And you wanna let go
Hold on, try to keep the flow down
Just don't give in, never give in, no

The birds can fly without worry
The danger is in their way
But still they just keep flying
Never give in, don't you give in, no

Time is ticking away
Your chance will come along someday
Time is ticking, time is ticking away

Hold on to what you believe in
Don't let time slip away
You know you've gotta keep trying
If that's what you take and so you need

Ooh, can't you feel the life around you?
It sure feels good enough
And if you use it in the right way, ooh, oh time

Time is ticking away
Your chance will come along someday
Time is ticking, time is ticking away

Time is ticking away
Your chance will come along someday
Time is ticking, time is ticking away

Time

Time is ticking away
Your chance will come along someday
Time is ticking, time is ticking away

Time

Ooh, can you feel the life around you?
It sure feels good enough
Time, if you use it in the right way, ooh, oh time

Time is ticking away
Your chance will come along someday
Time is ticking, time is ticking away

Time is ticking away
Your chance will come along someday
Time is ticking, time is ticking away

Time, time
Time, time
Time, time
Time, time
