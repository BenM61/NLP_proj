I never wanted another
Come over to me and discover
I want to be near you
And you need to be far away
You always seem to make me feel at home
Baby...
Before I go people lie

I never know, I never know, I never know, I never know why
You make me want to cry
I never know, I never know, I never know, I never know why
Forever live and die

I look at all of the people 
Doing it over and over
You're never getting older
I wish that you could be here
I hope that you and I 
Made the same mistakes
Baby...
Before I go

I never know, I never know, I never know, I never know why
You make me want to cry
I never know, I never know, I never know, I never know why
Forever live and die

I never know, I never know, I never know, I never know why
You make me want to cry
I never know, I never know, I never know, I never know why
Forever live and die

I never know, I never know, I never know, I never know why
You make me want to cry
I never know, I never know, I never know, I never know why
Forever, forever live and die
