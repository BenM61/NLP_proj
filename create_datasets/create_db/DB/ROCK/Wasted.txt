I don't know just what I'll do
Every time you walk into the room
Oh my head is spinning around
And I can't see clearly right now

I'm wasted
I'm so wasted on you
I'm so wasted on you 

I don't know if I'll survive,
In this magical land behind your eyes.
And there's all these funny little men,
There all asking me to dance and sing.

I'm wasted
I'm so wasted on you 
I'm so wasted on you 

Red and yellow, pink and green, purple and orange and blue.
Are all of the colors I see my love, every time I see you.

I'm wasted
I'm so wasted on you
I'm so wasted on you
