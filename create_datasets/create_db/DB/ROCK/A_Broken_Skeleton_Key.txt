Our house in our castle,
on the hills the horses glow.
Nights in white elephant porcelain 
glory days, take them slow.

Despite all logic, black magic and evil tricks,
maybe the reason is that inside of me I've been carrying
a broken skeleton key.

Goose skin always ends in wonders,
transcendence just makes you fly.
Wisdom apple pies never feed you,
wave hello, say goodbye. 

Despite all logic, black magic and evil tricks,
maybe the reason is that inside of me I've been carrying
a broken skeleton key.

Home is where your heart is,
sheep-skin chimneys could be waiting.
Lights dimmed, chocolate sunset,
blurry eyes on our Venice-veranda.

Despite all logic, black magic and evil tricks,
maybe the reason is that inside of me I've been carrying
a broken skeleton key.
