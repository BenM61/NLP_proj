I just wanna do something real to you
Like a real brother is suppose to do
Tell me how you feel baby
I'll give you something real baby
I just wanna do something real to you
Like a real brother is suppose to do
Tell me how you feel baby
I'll give you something real baby

Let's not pretend, I promise if we keep it real
Girl you will discover, I'll give you pleasure like no other
It's very spiritual but oh so physical
Mere words can't tell, you'll have to feel it for yourself
Because it's here right here my dear
Something that makes you smile again
Something that takes all night and then
I'm going to be the one that's still
Here right here my dear
The physical's only part of it
Give me a chance to show you a deeper love
Give you something real

I just wanna do something real to you
Like a real brother is suppose to do
Tell me how you feel baby
I'll give you something real baby
I just wanna do something real to you
Like a real brother is suppose to do
Tell me how you feel baby
I'll give you something real baby

Let me make this clear
I've been doing this for years
Now I understand
What a woman needs from her man
Spending money on my baby
Take a trip downtown and daily
I'm a drive you like Ms. Daisy
Ain't no nigga that can fade me
And baby I'm here, right here my dear
You don't even have to say a word
Your body calling and I heard
I just want to make sure
Baby I'm clear I'm clear
We'll take it slow so you can feel
Every bit of all I that I got to give
And it's all for real

I just wanna do something real to you
Like a real brother is suppose to do
Tell me how you feel baby
I'll give you something real baby
I just wanna do something real to you
Like a real brother is suppose to do
Tell me how you feel baby
I'll give you something real baby

Let me come inside, stay with me tonight
I'll take you places only we two can find
I just want to give something you can feel
Because I know there's no one better
I'm just keeping it real

I just wanna do something real to you
Like a real brother is suppose to do
Tell me how you feel baby
I'll give you something real baby
I just wanna do something real to you
Like a real brother is suppose to do
Tell me how you feel baby
I'll give you something real baby
