I know that lately,
Things haven't been so good.
I've always said,
"That if I could ever help you, I would."

Ohh hoo I hoo. Ohh hoo I hoo.
I love you for a thousand years.
Ohh hoo I hoo. Ohh hoo I hoo.
I'm here to wipe away the tears.

I will be your friend,
Until the end of time.
I will be your friend.
I'm here to make you smile.

When your falling apart I pick up each piece,
And build a wall around your dream.
The punches to you heart,
Melt away when you never thought they'd heal.

"So trust in me!"
These are the words I tattoo on you.
If Hercules can't pick you up now,
Then I really am true.

I will be your friend,
Until the end of time.
I will be your friend.
I'm here to make you smile.

Ohh hoo I hoo. Ohh hoo I hoo.
I love you for a thousand years.
Ohh hoo I hoo. Ohh hoo I hoo.
I'm here to wipe away the tears.

"You've got so much to give,"
I'll tell you just when you need to know.
"Get out and live,"
Pick you up when your feeling low.

So here's my hand,
Trust in me I really am true.
You've got to understand,
There's nothing I wouldn't do.

I will be your friend,
Until the end of time.
I will be your friend.
I'm here to make you smile.

I will be your friend,
Until the end of time.
I will be your friend.
I'm here to make you smile.

"You've got so much to give!"
"Get out and live!"

I will be your friend,
Until the end of time.
I will be your friend.
I'm here to make you smile.

The punches to you heart
Take my hand.
When you're falling apart
You've got to understand.
