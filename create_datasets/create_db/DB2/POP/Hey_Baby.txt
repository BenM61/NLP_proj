Hey, hey, baby, I want to know
If you'll be my girl,
Hey, hey, baby, I want to know
If you'll be my girl

When I saw you walking down the street,
I said, "that's the kind of girl I just like to meet"
She's so pretty, lord, she's so fine
I'm gonna make her mine, mine

I said, "hey, hey, baby, I want to know
If you'll be my girl"

When you turned and walked away
That's when I want to say
"Come on, baby, give me a whirl
I want to know if you'll be my girl"

I said, "hey, hey, baby, I want to know
If you'll be my girl"

When you turned and walked away
That's when I want to say
"Come on, baby, give me a whirl
I want to know if you'll be my girl"

I said, "hey, hey, baby, hey, baby!
I want to know if you'll be my girl"
All right, be my girl

"Let me hear it one time, boys!"
Hey, (hey, hey) hey baby, I want to know
If you'll be my girl

Hey, (hey, hey) hey baby, I want to know
If you'll be my girl

Hey, (hey) all right, oh!
