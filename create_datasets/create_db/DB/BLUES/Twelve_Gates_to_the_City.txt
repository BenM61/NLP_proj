Oh, what a beautiful city
Oh, what a beautiful city
Oh, what a beautiful city
Twelve gates to the city, hallelujah

And it's oh, what a beautiful
Oh, what a beautiful city
Oh, what a beautiful city
Twelve gates to the city, hallelujah

There's three gates in the East
There's three gates in the West
There's three gates in the North
There's three gates in the South
That makes twelve gates to the city, hallelujah

And it's, oh oh oh, what a beautiful
Oh, oh, what a beautiful
Twelve gates to the city, hallelujah

God Almighty, what you talkin' 'bout?
Oh, Lordy, yeah

Oh Lord, what a beautiful city
Oh, what a beautiful city
Oh, what a beautiful city
Twelve gates to the city, hallelujah

If you see my dear old mother
Won't you please tell her for me
That I'm on my way to the city
For the 'Meet me and Galilee'
They've made twelve gates to the city, hallelujah

Oh oh oh, what a beautiful
Whoa, oh oh oh, what a beautiful city
Twelve gates to the city, hallelujah

Oh Lord, what a beautiful
Whoa, oh Lord, what a beautiful city
Twelve gates to the city, hallelujah
