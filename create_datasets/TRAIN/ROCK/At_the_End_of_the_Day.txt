We will be together
We will be together
We will be together
(We will be together)

It's 5 AM on a Sunday morning
Walking uptown
In the rain in the snow
When I saw you
It came without a warning
A face like I had never seen
A feeling I had never known

Moving slow in the early morning
Making love in the quiet of the day
The world was waiting to take us to a new place
We knew that we were changing
We knew that we would never be the same

I know
I would do it all over again
At the end of the day
When we are alone
I get that feeling when I see your face
And I know
You'll be there at the end of the day

Two years later we are living together
We built our dream house on a hill by the sea
We could see the shadows that were growing in the distance
We were hiding our eyes
We were blind to what we did not wanna see

I know
I would do it all over again
At the end of the day
When we are alone
I get that feeling when I see your face
And I know
You'll be there at the end of the day

5 years gone by we have turned into strangers
We never talk now since you went away
Now I find myself walking in circles
I keep looking for you everywhere
Keep waiting for the end of the day

I know
I would do it all again
At the end of the day
When I'm all alone
I get a feeling that I can't explain
Oh, If I knew then what I know now
Wouldn't change a thing if I could somehow
I'd do it all over
Over and over again
I hope and I pray
We can do this all over again
At the end of the day
When I'm all alone
I close my eyes when I see your face
At the end of the day
when I'm all alone
I get a feeling that I can't explain
And I know
And I know
Yeah, we will be together someday
At the end of the day
Yeah, we will be together 
At the end of the day
Oh, we will be together today
At the end of the day
Yeah, we will be together
At the end of the day
Yeah, we will be together
