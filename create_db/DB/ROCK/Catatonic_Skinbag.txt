What a rare occasion
Dinner alone was a crime
Until a strange sensation
When I asked if I could be your guy
I never said it'd be easy
I'm the last man that I'd ever date
Always tired, lacking desire
To feel enough to start the day

What a drag, he's a catatonic skinbag
What a drag, he's a catatonic skinbag

Living can be simple
If you try your best to never try
What a lucky devil
Who reaps but never does his time
And everybody's happy
When you're the victim, I'm the crime
Who could fail, it's easy as braille
If you just read between the lines

What a drag, he's a catatonic skinbag
What a drag, he's a catatonic skinbag
What a drag, he's a catatonic skinbag
What a drag, he's a catatonic skinbag

January has come
But I wish he'd knock
If I liked to spend my evenings in darkness I'd go to the betting shop
And put it all on red
And crawl back into bed
Find a series brainlessly easy
And drink 'til I've a lolling head
Melt away in sheets
Warm from all the sweat
Dream I'm famous, wake up shameless
And sore from a night of regret
Ah-h, f*ck

What a drag, he's a catatonic skinbag
What a drag, he's a catatonic skinbag
What a drag, he's a catatonic skinbag
What a drag, he's a catatonic skinbag
Catatonic skinbag, catatonic skinbag
