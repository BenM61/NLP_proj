Before the west was won
Before Birmingham
Before your dad was young
Or your grandad

Before there was the word
Before the word was love
Before the Quarry men
And the Moondogs

There's always been that thing
That makes you want to sing
To the beat of the heart
Of the world

I'm all for love
And that's the truth now baby
Love for all

Before there was the yard
Before the clay set hard
Before the grass was green
And was rolled on

Before you try to stand 
Be sure you're on the land 
Love me forever Mabeline 

I'm all for love
And that's the truth now baby
Love for all

I've lit the candles 
Kick off your sandals 
You have a place in time 
Why not make it mine?
