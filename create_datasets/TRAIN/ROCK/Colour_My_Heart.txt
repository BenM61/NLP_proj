I'm gonna turn from the start line
And then we're leaving, we're leaving
'Cause you told me that the stars are mine
You didn't mean, didn't mean it

'Cause you left me with tears in my eyes
And you left like a thief in the night
I'm falling and I'm fighting
Do you feel, do you feel it?

Ooh
Yeah
Ooh
Hey

Don't colour my heart blues and greys
Don't tell me that I'm not OK
Don't colour my heart with your shades
Don't colour my heart 'cause I'll make it through
Yeah, I'll make it through
No more tears for you
Don't colour my heart

I remember all the lies you made
And I believed, I believed it
Tried to paint me in the darker shade
But I don't need, I don't need it

'Cause you left me with tears in my eyes
And you left like a thief in the night
I'm fighting in the fire
Am I burning, am I burning?

Ooh
Yeah
Ooh
Hey

Don't colour my heart blues and greys
Don't tell me that I'm not OK
Don't colour me with all your shades
Don't colour my heart 'cause I'll make it through
Yeah, I'll make it through
No more tears for you
Don't you colour my heart

Here I go from eye to eye
Done that things that I can't take back
Here I go from red to blue
You're telling things that you know ain't true
There you go from lie to lie
Telling me things that you know ain't right
Here I go from red to blue
You're telling things that you know ain't true
There you go from lie to lie
Telling me things that you know ain't right
Here I go from red to blue
You're telling things that you know ain't true
There you go from lie to lie
Telling me things that I know ain't right
Here I go from red to blue
You're telling things that you know ain't true

Don't colour my heart blues and greys
Don't tell me that I'm not OK
Don't colour me with all your shades
Don't colour my heart 'cause I'll make it through
Yeah, I'll make it through
No more tears for you
Please don't colour my heart 'cause I'll make it through
Yeah, I'll make it through
No more tears for you
Please don't colour my heart 'cause I'll make it through
Yeah, I'll make it through
No more tears for you
Don't colour my heart
