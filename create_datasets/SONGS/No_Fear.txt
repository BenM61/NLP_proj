Come on in now, come in out of the crowd.
Too many faces, too many loud sounds.
Stay awhile, won't you stay here in front of me.
Take your chances on what could be.

And when it's cold out, feel no fear
Here's someone to hold on to now, feel no fear.
So many lights now, their calling me to the night.
So many strangers on this broken avenue.
Feel no fear

Change, won't you roll me down and I can't go in.
Change your way won't you ride me down
