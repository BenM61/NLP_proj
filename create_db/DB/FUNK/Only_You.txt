Steve, oh
Oh, I was burning out desire, so I needed a woman to put out this fire
She said: "check it, check it, check it"

Sitting by my window
Watching the moonlight
In my home
Suddenly my mind
Is bringing out desire
In my home
So I got a woman
To put out this fire
Burning in my soul

Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire

Soon I had a phone call
From a woman
In my home
She was burning
Burning of desire
Just like I do
She wanted me to
Put out this fire
Burning in her soul

Only you, Steve
Can put out this fire
Only you, Steve
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul
Only you, Steve
Can put out this fire
Only you, Steve
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul

Suddenly my woman
Was in my arms
In my home
She was loving me
Sixty-nine times
In my home
She was putting
Putting out the fire
Burning in my soul

Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul

Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire

Only you, baby
Only you, baby
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Only you, baby
Only you, baby
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire

Only you, baby
Only you, baby
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Only you, baby
Only you
