Sometimes I wake up and the dark of night is creeping
And the early morning hush is all around
I wonder if any of my dreams are worth keeping
Or are they as foolish as they sound

There's so little time
And so much living
And so many treasures to be found
Maybe someday I'll find myself a warm bed to sleep in
Then the early morning hush won't get me down

There's so little time
And so much living
And so many treasures to be found
Maybe someday I'll find myself a warm bed to sleep in
Then the early morning hush won't get me down

Oh
Maybe someday I'll find myself a warm bed to sleep in
Then the early morning hush won't get me down

Early morning hush 
Early morning hush 
Early morning hush
