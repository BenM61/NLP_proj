I was thinking about the day we met
And the love came rushing out 
And you're empty handed filled with regret
I was thinks about the day we met
When the love came rushing out 
And you're empty handed filled with regret

Our love is running out
Our love is running
Our love is running
Our love is running out
Our love is running, running running out

Our love is running out
Our love is running
Our love is running
Our love is running out

Our love is running, running running out
I remember when I saw you cry
Like a waterfall you carried me
The way we just look into your eyes
I remember when I saw you cry
Like a waterfall you carried me

The way we just look into your eyes
Our love is running out
Our love is running
Our love is running
Our love running out
Our love is running, running running out

Our love is running out
Our love is running
Our love is running
Our love is running out
Our love is running, running, running out
Out, out, out, out
