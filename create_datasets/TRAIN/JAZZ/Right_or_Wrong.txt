Right or wrong, I'll always love you.
Though you're gone, I can't forget.
Right or wrong, I'll keep on dreaming,
Still I wake with that same old regret. 

All along I knew I'd lose you,
Though I prayed that you'd be true.
In your heart, please just remember,
Right or wrong, I'm still in love with you. 

Right or wrong, I'll always love you.
Though you're gone, I can't forget.
Right or wrong, I'll keep on dreaming,
Still I wake with that same old regret. 

All along I knew I'd lose you,
Though I prayed that you'd be true.
Oh Lord, in your heart, please just remember,
Right or wrong, I'm still in love with you.
