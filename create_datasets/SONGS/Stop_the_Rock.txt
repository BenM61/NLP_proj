Stop the rock, (stop the rock)
Stop the rock (stop the rock), can't stop the rock.
Stop the rock (stop the rock), can't stop the rock.
Stop the rock (stop the rock), we can't stop the rock. 
Stop the rock (stop the rock), we can't stop the rock.

Shake my paranoia, can't stop the rock 
Shake my paranoia, can't stop the rock 
Shake my paranoia, can't stop the rock 
Shake my paranoia, can't stop the rock 
Shake my paranoia, my groove is grooving 
Shake my paranoia, my groove is grooving
Dancing like Madonna, into the grooving

Come on get down and dirty baby!
Come on get down and dirty baby!
Come on get down and dirty baby!
Come on get down and dirty baby!
Down and dirty baby 
Down and dirty baby 
Down and dirty baby 
Down and dirty baby 

We shake the rock like animals.
Everyday at the waterhole.
