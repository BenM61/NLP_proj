I don't want you sending me flowers
Baby, I don't need you under my house
I'm sick and tired of talkin', talkin' on the telephone
Sick and tired of sittin', sittin' home alone

I need love, I need love, I need love
Girls need love, girls need love

Why, why do you keep neglecting me?
Baby, can't you see that it's hurtin' me
I'm sick and tired of you giving me the run around
When I need your love you're no where to be found

I need love, sweet love, sweet love
Oh oh oh, girls need love, sure need love

I'm sick and tired of you
You been givin' me the run around
When I need your kiss you're no where to be found

I need love, sweet love, sweet love
Oh oh oh, girls need love, sure need love
We need love, sweet love, your love
You know that girls need love, sure need love

I need love, sweet love, sweet love
Oh oh oh, girls need love, girls need love
We need love, sweet love, love, love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, girls need love, girls need love

Love, sweet love, love
I know that girls need love, sure need love, love
Love
