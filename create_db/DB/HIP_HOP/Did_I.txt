You got a lot of things to say
You got a lot of things on your plate
You got a lot on me
Know a lot of things that I just can not say is quite on my wave
You bitches riding on all my waves
But you bitches tired and underpaid
And shawty got zero percent on her publishing
Cause she don't write the shit she say
Cause I'm up right now, been up
I'll come down when I'm not so high
And life's not so loud
Cause I been wet, tsunami the mob, that's a real set
Tsunami the sound, they the real best
Tsunami rolled in that's the realest, realest

You can tell me you ain't mean it
You can tell me it's deceiving
That you said it for no reason
But you seeming like you tryna get asked

Did I? Did I?
Hurt your feelings when I stunted like that
Hurt your feelings when I stunted like that
Did I? Did I?
Hurt your feelings when I hustled like that
Hurt your feelings when I hustled like that
Did I? Did I?
Waste my time, tryna keep it all running
Waste my time, tryna keep it all running
Did I? Did I?
Hurt your feelings when I hustled like that
Hurt your feelings when I stunted like that
Did I? Did I?

You used to living through all the screens
You used to wearing designer things
You don't know nothing 'bout working your way from the bottom and earning every ring
You think we competing for rings, you think you playing in my league
But you couldn't catch up if I took a break and vacationed for weeks on top of weeks
Cause I'm up right now, been up
I'll come down when I'm not so high
And life's not so loud
Cause I been hard, I write every word and they been bars
Take every title, they been ours
Pull up lowkey cause we been stars, been stars

You can tell me you ain't mean it
You can tell me it's deceiving
That you said it for no reason
But you seeming like you tryna get asked

Did I? Did I?
Hurt your feelings when I stunted like that
Hurt your feelings when I stunted like that
Did I? Did I?
Hurt your feelings when I hustled like that
Hurt your feelings when I hustled like that
Did I? Did I?
Waste my time, tryna keep it all running
Waste my time, tryna keep it all running
Did I? Did I?
Hurt your feelings when I hustled like that
Hurt your feelings when I stunted like that
Did I? Did I?

You can't fake it
You can't fake it
You can't fake it
What is real is recognizing
We don't recognize you
You can't take it
You can't take it
You can't take it
It's too real for you to handle
So I got one more question

Did I?
Hurt your feelings when I stunted like that
Hurt your feelings when I stunted like that
Did I? Did I?
Hurt your feelings when I hustled like that
Hurt your feelings when I hustled like that
Did I?
Hurt your feelings
Waste my time, tryna keep it all running
Waste my time, tryna keep it all running (Did I waste my time? Did I waste my time?)
Did I? Did I?
Hurt your feelings when I hustled like that
Hurt your feelings when I stunted like that
Did I? Did I?

Did I miss out on you?
