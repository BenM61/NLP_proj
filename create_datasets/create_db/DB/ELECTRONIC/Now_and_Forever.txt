Now and forever
you are a part of me
And the memory cuts like a knife

Didnt we find the ecstacy 
Didnt we share the daylight
When you walked into my life

Now and forever
I'll remember all the promises still unbroken
And think about all the words between us 
That never needed to be spoken

We had a moment
Just one moment 
That will last beyond a dream, 
Beyond a lifetime

We are the lucky ones
Some people never get to do 
All we got to do

Now and forever 
I will always think of you

Didnt we come together
Didnt we live together
Didnt we cry together
Didnt we play together
Didnt we love together
And together we lit up the world

I miss the tears
I miss the laughter
I miss the day we met 
and all that followed after

Sometimes I wish I 
could always be with you
The way we used to do

Now and forever 
I will always think of you

Now and forever
I will always be with you
