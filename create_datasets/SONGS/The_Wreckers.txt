The breakers roar on an unseen shore
In the teeth of a hurricane
Oh, we struggle in vain

A hellish night, a ghostly light
Appears through the driving rain
Salvation in a human chain

All I know is that sometimes you have to be wary
Of a miracle too good to be true
All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary
Everything in life you thought you knew
All I know is that sometimes you have to be wary
'Cause sometimes the target is you

Driven to ground with a helpful sound
Drowned by the cheer from the shore
Oh, we wonder what for

The people swarm through the darkening storm
Gather everything they can score
Till their backs won't bear any more

All I know is that sometimes you have to be wary
Of a miracle too good to be true
All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary
Everything in life you thought you knew
All I know is that sometimes you have to be wary
Of a miracle too good to be true
All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary
'Cause sometimes the target is you

The breaker's roar on an unseen shore
In the teeth of an icy grave
In the teeth of an icy grave

Whoa, the human chain
Leaves a bloody stain
Washed away in the pounding waves
Washed away in the pounding waves

All I know is that sometimes you have to be wary
Of a miracle too good to be true
All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary
Everything in life you thought you knew
All I know is that sometimes you have to be wary
'Cause sometimes the target is you
All I know is that memory can be too much to carry 
Striking down like a bolt from the blue
All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary 
Everything in life you thought you knew

All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary
'Cause sometimes the target is you
