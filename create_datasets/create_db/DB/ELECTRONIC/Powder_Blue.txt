Your eyes are just like black spiders
Your hair and dress in ribbons, baby cakes
In despair or incoherent. 
Nothing in between
China white, my bride tonight
Smiling on the tiles

Bring that minute back
We never get so close as when the sun-ward flight begins

I share it all with you
Powder blue
Stumble through the crowds together
They're trying to ignore us, that's o.k.
I'm proud to be the one you hold when the shakes begin

Sallow skinned, starry eyed, blessed
In our sin
Bring that minute back
We never get so close to death
Makes you so alive
I share it all with you
Powder blue
