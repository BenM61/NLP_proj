Mirror mirror mon amour

If I was to tell you how I feel
That my love was silent that my heart was real
I've been looking at you you've been looking at me
And I want you to know that I like what I see

Mirror mirror mon amour
Send me what I'm waiting for
Pick me up an image so fine so fine
Mirror mirror mon amour
Give me what I'm waiting for
Set my heart on making you mine

In a moments anger I will freeze the frame
But my feelings for ya how they will remain
I've been looking at you you've been looking at me
And I want you to know that I like what I see

Mirror mirror mon amour
Send me what I'm waiting for
Pick me up an image so fine so fine
Mirror mirror mon amour
Give me what I'm waiting for
Set my heart on making you mine

My mirror always echoes
My mirror always echoes
My mirror always echoes
Mirror mirror mirror mirror mirror
Only in my mirror

Mirror mirror mon amour
Send me what I'm waiting for
Pick me up an image so fine so fine
Mirror mirror mon amour
Give me what I'm waiting for
Set my heart on making you mine

Mirror mirror mon amour is in my head
Mirror mirror mon amour is in my head
Mirror mirror mon amour is in my head
Mirror mirror mon amour is in my head
So fine

My mirror always echoes (echoes)
My mirror always echoes (echoes)
So fine
Mirror mirror mon amour (mon amour mon amour
