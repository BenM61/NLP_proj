The time has come, let us begin
With all our voices joining in
To sing of love and brotherhood
People doing what they should to
Help there fellow man decree
And fill this land with harmony
The young and old, the rich, the poor
Making sounds, never heard before

Harmony! Harmony!
Let's all join in harmony
Sing away the hurt and fear
A great new dream will soon be here

Like the shepherd guards his sheep
Watch your children as they sleep
Like the potter turns his clay

Help to shape a better day, and
Let us sing a song of love
There's one thing I'm certain of
Love will fill the hearts of men
Peace will come on earth once again

Harmony! Harmony!
Let's all join in harmony
Sing away the hurt and fear
A great new dream will soon be here

Harmony! Harmony!
Let's all join in harmony
Sing of love, and brotherhood
And people doing what they should

Harmony! Harmony!
Let's all join in harmony
