Well my old car's a-rollin' down the line 
Thoughts of my baby runnin' through my mind
She's a-waitin' for me, I gotta be on time
I gotta roll

Well, the white marker's flying off the road below
When I'm really flying low
My baby's waiting, I can't go slow
I gotta roll

Well, the big policeman pulled along side of me
He said "Boy, you ain't quite as fast as me"
I showed him a picture of that baby of mine
He said "Boy, you gotta roll on down that line"
