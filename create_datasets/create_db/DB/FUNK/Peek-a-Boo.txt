What is your thing, uh?
Oh, what is your thing?

I'm barkin' out, saying I can't stand it
Your love is my bad habit
Oh give me, give me, a sign, a clue
Let me sneak a peek and see inside of you

What is your thing?
You got me wondering
Peek-a-boo
Can I see you?

I'm on your string
You got me dangling
Now peek-a-boo
Can I see you

I'm gonna see what's on the inside, oh baby
I wanna know, I wanna know
I'm gonna see what's on the inside, oh baby
I wanna know, I wanna know

Without a doubt, your love is a river
Oh, it makes my liver quiver
But tell me, tell me, why do you hide?
Open up, be real and let me feel what you feel inside 

Why must we play these peek-a-boo games?
Oh, why must we play these games?
Are you so conceited or just too ashamed?

What is your thing?
Oh, you got me wondering
Peek-a-boo
Can I see you?

I'm on your string
Whoa, you got me dangling
Peek-a-boo
Can I see you

I'm gonna see what's on the inside, oh baby
I wanna know, I wanna know
I'm gonna see what's on the inside, oh baby
I wanna know, I wanna know

I'm barkin' out (what's the matter with you, baby?) 
Ah, what's the matter with you, baby?
