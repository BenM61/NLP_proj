You're stuck in my head, stuck on my heart
Stuck on my body, body
I wanna go, get out of here
I'm sick of the party, party
I'd run away, I'd run away with you

Now, this is the part, you've got to say
All that you're feeling, feeling
Packing a bag, leaving at night
When everyone's sleeping, sleeping
Let's run away, I'll run away with you

'Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I'll find your lips under street lights
And I wanna be there with you, ooh

Baby, take me to the feeling
I'll be your sinner, in secret
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me
Baby, every single minute
I'll be your hero, I'm willing
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me

Up in the clouds, high as a kite, over the city, city
We never sleep, we're never tired, when you are with me, with me
I wanna stay, I wanna stay here with you

'Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I'll find your lips under street lights
And I wanna be there with you, ooh

Baby, take me to the feeling
I'll be your sinner, in secret
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me
Baby, every single minute
I'll be your hero, I'm willing
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Run away with me

Hold on to me
I never want to let you go
Over the weekend
We can turn the world to gold
Run away with me
Run away with me
