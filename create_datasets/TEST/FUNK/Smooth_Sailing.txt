We didn't break apart in stormy weather
We didn't run around like others do
Now we're not afraid when storm clouds gather
'Cause we got the kind of love that'll see us through

We've got smooth sailing, sailing
Looks like every drop of rain is gone, gone, gone
Smooth sailing, sailing
And a blue sky full of rainbows from now on

We find each others arms in troubled waters
We found that's the safest place to go
From now we can laugh at troubled waters
'Cause our roughest storms just seem to make love grow

We've got smooth sailing, sailing
Looks like every drop of rain is gone, gone, gone
Smooth sailing, sailing
And a blue sky full of rainbows from now on
