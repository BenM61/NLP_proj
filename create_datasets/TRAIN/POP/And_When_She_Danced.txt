Can you go back in time to a place in your mind
To the one who know a part of you
That you just couldn't find

If you ask me to choose between a memory or two
When it's said and done
I'll take the one who's love I had to lose

Cause when she danced
I lost my inner sense
I loved her danced I always will

She left with me
But still with me
A burnin' memory
She took with her a part of me

If I could get back where I've been
Feel the passion I left then
I'd be there right now and get somehow
It never comes again

She had nothin' to gain
Nowhere to go
To the way out of pain
The time with
With a song and dance she lost romance
The world had gone insane

Caused when she danced
Caused when we danced
I lost my inner sense
I loved her dance
I love
I always will
I always will

She left with me
He left with me
A burnin' memory, remember somehow
She took with her a part of me

Can you go back in time to a place in your mind
To the one who knew a part of you
That you just couldn't find

Lookin' back I'm not sure
If I couldn't heard someone
When she danced with me
Our hearts were free as far as I could see

I'd be there right now and yet somehow
It never comes again

When she danced with me 
Our hearts were free
Were free
As far as I could see
