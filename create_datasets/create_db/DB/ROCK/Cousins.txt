You found a sweater on the ocean floor
They're gonna find it if you didn't close the door.
You and this model sit outside the side
In a house on a street they wouldn't park on at night.

Dad was a risk taker.
His was a shoe maker.
You greatest hits 2006, little list maker.
Caught in the melody, you wait in the car.
You were born with ten fingers and you're gonna use them all.

Interest in girls as I discovered myself
If your odd-life was greater
You'll be toastin' my health
If an interest in culture,
You should be lining the walls.
When your birth right is interest
You could just accrue it all.

Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
It's a line that is always running.
Me and my cousins, and you and your cousins,
I can feel it coming

You could turn your back on the bitter world

Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
It's a line that is always running.
Me and my cousins, and you and your cousins,
I can feel it coming

Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
It's a line that is always running.
Me and my cousins, and you and your cousins,
I can feel it coming
