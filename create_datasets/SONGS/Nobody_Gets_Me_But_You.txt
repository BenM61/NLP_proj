Nobody gets what I say,
Must be some way to convey,
But no-one else remembers my name,
Just the parts that I play.

Nobody gets,
Nobody gets me but you.
No-one gets what I've done,
Everyone else seems to look trough.
Oh but maybe I've never wanted them to.
Couldn't count on it anyway.

Nobody gets,
Nobody cuts me like you.

Nobody gets what I say,
Those who know, those who lose.
Those who look trough.
Do they get me?

I thought they get me like you,
Oh no!
Nobody.
Nobody.
Nobody.
No.
Oh no-one.
