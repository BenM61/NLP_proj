Many moons have passed
Since our paths last crossed
Did you maybe lose your way?
'Cause time is my everything

Time is my everything
For you I'd do anything
Under the sun
And child, don't you fear anything
For all of the wicked men
Shall have to stand in line

I know you're gonna see it in the fullness of time
I know you're gonna see it in the fullness of time

So many moons have passed
Since our paths last crossed
You're gonna have to find a way,
Time is my everything

Time is my everything
For you I'd do anything
Under the sun
Child, don't you fear anything
For even the greatest men
Shall have to stand in line

I know you're gonna see it in the fullness of time
Ain't the devil happy when two lovers break a bond they made?
Happy ever after when two lovers come as one again
I know you're gonna see it in the fullness of time

I know you're gonna see it in the fullness of time
