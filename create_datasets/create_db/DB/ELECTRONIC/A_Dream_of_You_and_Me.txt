I wrestled by the sea
A loneliness in me
I asked myself for peace
And found it at my feet
Staring at the sea

All that glitters is gold
Don't believe what you've been told
People lie, people love, people go
But beauty lies, in every soul

I wrestled by the sea
A dream of you and me
I let it go from me
It washed up at my feet
Staring at the sea

All that glitters is gold
Don't believe what you've been told
People lie, people love, people go
But beauty lies, in every soul

If you wait, if you wait for the morning
If you wait, if you wait for the morning
If you wait, if you wait for the morning
If you wait, if you wait for the morning

How long, how long
How long, how long

I asked myself for peace
I asked myself for peace
I asked myself for peace
I asked myself for peace
I asked myself for peace
And found a piece of me
Staring at the sea
