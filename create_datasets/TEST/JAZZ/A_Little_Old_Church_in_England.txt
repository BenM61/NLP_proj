A little old church in England tumbled down 
A little old-fashioned church in London town 
A pile of mortar and brick appears 
Where it had peacefully stood for years 
A little old church is gone beyond repair 
But after a while a new church will be there 
And we'll hear nothing but good 
Where the little old church in England stood 
Where the little old church in England stood... 
(repeat once)
(repeat once)
