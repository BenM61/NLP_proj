Hey Blackberry, How you taste so sweet
Hey Blackberry, tell me what you see
Tell me is it interesting
Hey Blackberry pay some attention to me
Hey Blackberry look at my bumblebee
Hey Blackberry you know he never stings
And he only hums for me

I need some L-O-V-E-N to make me happy
You got to be L-you-see-K-why to git
With a girl like Blackberry

Hey my cherry,coming up my street
Hey my cherry, you make it hard to breath
Look what you've done to me
Hey my cherry, be sure to keep your nose clean
