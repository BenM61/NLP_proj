A walk in the park
Or late night TV
I'm a kind of simple man
I need you to understand

A car and a dog
An apartment uptown
I don't have much but me
But I'd give it all it we could be

Girl, I'm only one man
Doin' what I can
To give you everything you need
To be everything that I can be

I'm only one man
Doin' what I can (Mmm, mmm)
To give you everything you need
To be everything that I can be (Yeah)

A job and a dream (Whoa)
Keep me off the streets
But sometimes I wanna go
So I can buy you fancy clothes and feed you

I pray that some day
My dreams will come true
And the first thing that I'm gonna do
Is promise eternal love to you

Girl, I'm only one man
Doin' what I can (Mmm, mmm)
To give you everything you need
To be everything that I can be

I'm only one man
Doin' what I can
To give you everything you need
To be everything that I can be

I'mma just sing it (Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
A second time (Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
If you're mine (Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
I'mma just take my time (Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)

So (Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
Oh (Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
Whoa, whoa (Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
Whoa, whoa (Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)

Girl, I'm only one man
Doin' what I can
To give you everything you need
To be everything that I can be

Girl, I'm only one man
Doin' what I can
To give you everything you need
To be everything that I can be

Girl, you know I'm only one man
Tryin' to do the best I can
Girl, you know I'm only one man
Tryin' to do the best I can

Girl, you know I'm only one man
Tryin' to do the best I can
Girl, you know I'm only one man
