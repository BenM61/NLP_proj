You don't understand it
All of a sudden something's wrong
You take it for granted
All of a sudden time is gone

You put a little distance in between it
Hope it makes sense later on

You don't know what happened
Dreams never turn out like you planned
The next moment you wake up
Stranded in a one night stand

You put a little distance in between it
Until you seen it hope that later on

I know it's hard to wait that long
But right now baby
We both agree, something's wrong
Something's wrong

All of a sudden
May be weak and try again
But baby, baby, baby I don't know when
Until then

You put a little distance in between it
Until we seen it
Maybe later on

I know it's hard it seems so long
We both agree, oh baby
I know, I know.
