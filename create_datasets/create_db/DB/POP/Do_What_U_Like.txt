Do what you like, do what you like
Sugar sweet, if only they all knew 
Jam, can't spread no more you've took my bread 
Energy, just work, no rest or play 
Me, myself I'd rather be alone again 

So you can do what you like, do what you like 
No need to ask me, do what you want 
Do what you like, do what you like 
No need to tell me, do what you want 

Cherry pie, you're not as cute as me 
Ice, could never be as cold as you 
Recipe, you stir me up inside 
Me, myself I'd rather be alone again 

So you can do what you like, do what you like 
No need to ask me, do what you want 
Do what you like, do what you like 
No need to tell me, do what you want 

So you can do what you like, do what you like 
No need to ask me, do what you want 
Do what you like, ooh
No need to tell me, no need to tell me

Oh ho, maybe, maybe, oh
Do what you like
Do what you want
Do what you like
Do what you want

Me, myself I'd rather be alone again 
So you can do what you like, do what you like 
No need to ask me, do what you want 
Do what you like, do what you like 
No need to tell me, do what you want 
Do what you like, do what you want
No need to ask me, do what you want
Do what you like
