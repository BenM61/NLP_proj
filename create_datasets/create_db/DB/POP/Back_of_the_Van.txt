In the dark, in the back of the van cautiously holding your hand
Making eyes, making everything alright
Being home, being all alone, feeling sad watching the phone
Singing out, singing everything's alright

You set me on, you set me on, you set me on fire
You set me on, you set me on, you set me on fire

In the dark, in the back of the van cautiously holding your hand
Making eyes, making everything alright
When I'm out, when I'm far away wanting you, wanting to stay
Singing out, singing everything's alright

Cause you set me on, you set me on, you set me on fire
You set me on, you set me on, you set me on fire
You set me on, you set me on, you set me on fire
You set me on, you set me on, you set me on fire

When I wake and I'm far away, I know that you're leaving
In the dark when I'm all alone, I'm scared that you're leaving
When I wake and I'm far away, I know that you're leaving
In the dark when I'm all alone, I'm scared that you're leaving

Cause you set me on, you set me on, you set me on fire
You set me on, you set me on, you set me on fire
You set me on, you set me on, you set me on fire
You set me on, you set me on, you set me on fire
You set me on, you set me on, you set me on fire
You set me on, you set me on, you set me on fire
