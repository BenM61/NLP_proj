Can you feel the stinging?
Cry bloody murder when the bugs bite you
Hit 'em with a hammer
But why hit 'em with a book when a word will do?

Hung up on the headlines
Rewriting how the west was won
The devil's in the details
The friendly fire and scapegoat sons

You pushed us down
On the way to make a better world
You pushed us 'round
On the way to make a better world

Can you taste the glory?
Let the worm crawl on your lips
Sugar filled my belly
Just touch the truth with your fingertips

There's nothing really out there
Just a world of people you don't know
When the fables fade away
Turn over to another show

You pushed us down
On the way to make a better world
You pushed us 'round
On the way to make a better world

You push us down
On the way to make a better world
You push us 'round
On the way to make a better world

We are the ones that you left behind
We are the ones that you left behind
We are the ones that you left behind
We are the ones that you left behind

We are the ones that you left behind
We are the ones that you left behind
We are the ones that you left behind
We are the ones that you left behind

We are the ones that you left behind
We are the ones that you left behind
We are the ones that you left behind
We are the ones that you left behind

Are you gonna stagger backwards?
Fall into an air-conditioned hell
Write about the spotlights
So bright you lose sight of yourself
Where were you when you heard the news
About the wolf that's out your door?
Get outside and I think you'll find that we have seen all this before

Before you push us down
On the way to make a better world
You push us 'round
On the way to make a better world

Before you push us down
On the way to make a better world
You push us 'round
On the way to make a better world
