The distance between our bodies
Make me feel like I want ya
Gyal I feel like I want ya
The distance between our bodies
Gyal you whine like a woah yeah
Put me gun in your holster
The distance between us

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Roll tide like Crimson
That's how I like my women
Like I like my chicken
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Gyal come closer to me
Gyal come closer to me

So much distance between us
Distance between our bodies
So much distance between us
Distance between our bodies, yeah
So much distance between us

Hit me on the phone
I be up late night talkin' like a smooth operator
Losin' all control
I need that poom-poom right now, ayy
Got me in the open
Like a drop top Chevy in the hood sittin' low
But I'm tryna put you in the Wraith
So girl don't get ghostin'

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Roll tide like Crimson
That's how I like my women
Like I like my chicken
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Gyal come closer to me
Gyal come closer to me

So much distance between us
Distance between our bodies
So much distance between us
Distance between our bodies, yeah
So much distance between us

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Roll tide like Crimson
That's how I like my women
Like I like my chicken
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Gyal come closer to me
Gyal come closer to me

So much distance between us
Distance between our bodies
So much distance between us
Distance between our bodies, yeah
So much distance between us
