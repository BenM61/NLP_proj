his technich simply took out this world
he filled my heart with joy and cheerr

a real gone guy and i love him deed i do

he's gentle he's great he's all the world to me
he knows what to do
when i am feeling blue
he grabs me and whispers theirs no one in the world but you
he is real gone

he's a real gone guy and i love him yes i do

sometimes he erks me with his line of jive
sometimes he erks me with his line of jove
when he goes away i wait for him to come back
and i'd unpack 
the love i still have for that man of mine
he is real gone
he's a real gone guy and i love him deed i do
