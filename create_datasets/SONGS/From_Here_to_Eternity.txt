I am yours without a doubt, without a doubt you're mine
We have optimistic love in pessimistic times
So kiss me, say goodbye to me
Be sure you don't cry for me
I'll see you at the end
When our roads meet again

From here to eternity
You'll be with me, you'll be with me
From here to eternity
You'll be with me, you'll be with me
You are my blood, I am your blood
You're my staunchest friend
We've had our quarrels and our squabbles
And fall in love again
So I must leave you here tonight
Follow me when the time is right
Time is not my friend
Till we meet again

From here to eternity
You'll be with me, you'll be with me
From here to eternity
You'll be with me, you'll be with me
You are my blood, I am your blood
You're my staunchest friend
We've had our quarrels and our squabbles
And fall in love again
So I must leave you here tonight
Follow me when the time is right
Time is not my friend
Till we meet again

So kiss me, say goodbye to me
Be sure you don't cry for me
I'll see you at the end
When our roads meet again

From here to eternity
You'll be with me, you'll be with me
From here to eternity
You'll be with me, you'll be with me
You are my blood, I am your blood
You're my staunchest friend
We've had our quarrels and our squabbles
And fall in love again
So I must leave you here tonight
Follow me when the time is right
Time is not my friend
Till we meet again
