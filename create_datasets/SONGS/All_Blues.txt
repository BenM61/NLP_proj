The sea, the sky, the you and I
The sea, the sky, for you and I
I'll know we're all blues
All Shades, all hues, all blues

Some blues are sad
But some are glad,
Dark-sad or bright-gald
They're all blues
All shades, all hues, all blues

The color of colors
The blues are more than a color
They're a moan of pain
A Taste of strife
And a sad refrain

A game which lif is pplayin'
Blues can be the livin' dues
We're all a-payin'
Yeah, Oh Lord

In a rainbow
A summer day that's fair
A parayer is prayed
A lament that's made

Some shade of blues is there;
Blue heaven's hue,
They're all blues

Talkin' 'bout the sea and the sky
Andi'm talkin' 'bout you and I
The sea, the sky
For you and I

And I know we're all blues
All shades,
All hues,
All blues

Sea, sky, you and I
See the sky, you and I
All Blues
All shades, all hues, all blues
