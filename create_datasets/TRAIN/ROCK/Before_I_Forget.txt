Go

Stapled shut inside an outside world
And I'm sealed in tight
Bizarre but right at home

I'm claustrophobic closing in
And I'm catastrophic
Not again

I'm smeared across the page and doused in gasoline
I wear you like a stain
Yet I'm the one who's obscene

Catch me up on all your sordid little insurrections
I've got no time to lose
I'm just caught up in all the cattle

Fray the strings
Through the sheathes
Hold your breath
Listen

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that

I'm ripped across the ditch and settled in the dirt
And I wear you like a stitch
Yet I'm the one who's hurt

Pay attention to your twisted little indiscretions
I've got no right to win
I'm just caught up in all the battles

Locked in clutch
Pushed in place
Hold your breath
Listen

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that

My end, it justifies my means
All I ever do is delay
My every attempt to evade
The end of the road is my end

It justifies my means
All I ever do is delay
I haven't time to evade
The end of the road

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that

Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ooh
