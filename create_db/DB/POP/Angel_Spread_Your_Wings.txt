Prisoners of the heart in search of love and peace
Hung in desperation, longing for release
I'm just a traveler, angel, you're my ride
Take me past the place I've passed the last time that I died

Angel spread your wings, I want to fly away with you
Take me in your arms, I know you're dying to
Fly away forever, fly away forever, fly away forever
Angel spread your wings

Angel comes into my room, it's dark and so is she
Wants to know if she can take me soaring out to sea
Lying in her darkness like a child awaiting birth
Angel comes and takes me for everything I'm worth

Angel spread your wings, I want to fly away with you
Take me in your arms, I know you're dying to
Fly away forever, fly away forever, fly away forever
Angel spread your wings

Angel spread your wings, I want to fly away with you
Spread your wings and take me
Spread your wings and make me
I know, I know, I know, I know you're dying to
Fly away forever, fly away forever, fly away forever
Angel spread your wings

Angel spread your wings, I want to fly away with you
Angel spread your wings, I want to fly away with you
Angel spread your wings, angel spread your wings
