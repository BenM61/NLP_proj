We're gonna be
Keeping the mystery alive

I'm telling you
Girl

The secret is
Keeping the mystery alive

It's hurry up and wait
Red tape
Can't escape

Mustn't be late
The school bell is ringing
Soon as we're born we're taught to conform

Don't you get above your upbringing!

But you and me
Girl
We'll keep the magic that we've got

In the future
When we're surrounded by robots

We're gonna be 

Keeping the mystery alive
I'm telling you

Girl
The secret is
Keeping the mystery alive
As you go through this world

Remember this
From nine to five you'll lose your mind
If you don't keep the mystery alive!

Television screen
Someone's telling me
What I should think and how I should be living
Everything's so predictable
Don't you know

Everyone takes more than they are giving.

But you and me
Girl
We'll find a way to ease the pressure

With each other we'll find a way to keep it special

We're gonna be 

Keeping the mystery alive
I'm telling you

Girl
The secret is

But you and me
Girl
We'll keep the magic

Oh
We'll keep the mystery as we go through this world.
We'll find a way to keep it special
We're gonna be -

Keeping the mystery alive
I'm telling you

Girl
The secret is

But you've got to keep the mystery

To keep the mystery
The secret is
You've got to keep the mystery

To keep the mystery
Remember this
Pays to keep the mystery

From nine to five you'll lose your mind

But you've got to keep the mystery

Keep the mystery
The secret is!
