Girl, what part of life can I avoid the pain
To free my heart and let my mind astray
This feeling that I feel is hard to trace
It takes my soul right into outerspace
So lost but almost found in misbelief
The tenderness of being in between
An ego that I force myself to feed
Ignoring what I want for what I need
I wanna emphasize on your blessings
Loving you in your sections
Doing full time when I check in

Yeah

Tempted by feelings that feel so familiar, uh
Blinded by love and all of the above
Taking by wishes with no permission permitted
I hate that my lifestyle has caused you to think that I'm not committed
The more that I say I don't want it, I know that I need it
You take it away and let me do all the fiening
You know how much I crave you
You know how much I hate to
But you give me that discipline then put some cinnamon on it
Girl damn you're so sweet to me
Do what you wanna
I could kiss on your feet you got all of the heat on me
Your winning me over
I hate being sober just doesn't feel the same anymore
It's felt in my vein I'm so over the games
But there's no one to blame anymore

This doesn't feel the same anymore
It's all on me
It's all on me
There's no one to blame anymore
'Cause it's all on me
It's all on me
This doesn't feel the same anymore
It's all on me
It's all on me
There's no one to blame anymore
It's all on me
It's all on me

If you could tell me now, baby tell me what it is
I been looking for an answer, yeah
You done put me through the test, we couldn't be just friends
Got me thinking about the masses
How far could we take it if we lifted off
Would you hold me down when things start to pick up
So far left I would hope to get it right this time
Hate to think I barely ever cross your mind
But I think about it way too much
How you gone get fucked up and tell me it's nothing
Inside it kills tell me how it feel when you really can't feel nothing
Stuck on my words why does it hurt
Every time I say something 
Sometimes it hit so hard you aim to be numb, but

If it doesn't feel the same anymore 
It's all on me, it's all on me
There's no one to blame anymore
And it's all on me
It's all on me

I just want you you you
Girl I just want you you you
I just want you you you, you you you
Girl I just want 
To want me
Girl I just want you you you you you
Girl I just want you you you you you
Girl I just want you you you
Girl I just want you 
To want me
