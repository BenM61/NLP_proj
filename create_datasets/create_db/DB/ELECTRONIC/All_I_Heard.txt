The hotel and the door
The people want some more
The footsteps drag behind
I'll get you if I try

I can't stop
Knowing you will find
Make it hot
Always down the line
I wont sleep
In the middle of the night
So follow me
And only you will find

When it comes the day
You come back to me
Before long
You will see
Its all true
Every little word
So be calm 
That's all I heard
That's all I heard

The motion on the ground
The pictures all around
The others left behind
I'll find you if I try

I can't stop
Knowing you will find
Make it hot
Always down the line
I wont sleep
In the middle of the night
So follow me
And only you will find

When it comes the day
You come back to me
Before long
You will see
Its all true
Every little word
So be calm 
That's all I heard
That's all I heard
