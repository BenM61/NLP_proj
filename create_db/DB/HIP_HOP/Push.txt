Pushin', pushin', pushin', pushin'

I live my life one day at a time
Whoa, my head, so I don't lose my mind
Sometimes you might fall down
But you get back up, get on your journey

Yeah, keep on pushin'
Pushin', pushin', pushin', ooh

I walked downstairs in my body?s light
And pushed my struggles, endured my pride
I fear no man, I know wrong from right
We push until the day we see the light

And we keep on pushin'
Pushin', pushin', pushin', ooh

Your weak ass compubot's power shots mix fly over me
My accurate jabs connect like rotary
Make you notice me, be like damn, dudes on some totally
When he rides the bass line like Ginobili

I'm vocally unmatched, globally with the flow
Slow on the ground but more public than notary
Push, in this era of G.W. Bush
We must load mental ammunition and bust, thus

I'm a hold you down, I got you
One more repetition, I'm a spot you
This is for my blue collar workin', beer guzzlin'
Bootleg, D-V-D sellin', keep hustlin?, push

If you represent the struggle, then push
Peep the pieces of the puzzle and push
Never let 'em place a muzzle, just push

Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
