You know more than you think you know
This universe is in your eyes
Inside the galaxies collide

Which parent told you that you're slow?
My absent dad, my mum's control
Schooled me to be a worker drone

So this is it
A life on earth
We're made of stars
We're made of dirt
Unconsciousness
We disconnect
Tone deaf to calling

We learn to walk like you
Talk like you
Oo-be-do
Think like you
Whine like you
Love like you in pieces

God knows I know no better
Easy to say that I can talk
I can talk

You know more than you think you know
Your DNA is pulsed by stars
Reveal the cogs that wheel the show

So this is it
A universe of birth and death
Love and neglect
But we forget
Dad's off on tour or in a meeting

We will not walk like you
Talk like you
Oo-be-do
Fight like you
Screwed like you
Break like you
In pieces

God knows I know no better
Easy to say that I can talk
I can talk
God knows I know no better
Easy to say that I can talk
(I can talk, I can talk, I can talk)
I can talk
(I can talk, I can talk, I can talk)
I can talk
(I can talk, I can talk, I can talk)

Welcome to our coming of age
To embrace all that we've become
Bored with your stories of pain
Shoot yourself with a ricochet
You don't know, you don't know, you don't know me
You don't know, you don't know, you don't know me

Let's inspire, let's inflame, create awe from our pain
Find a love that's as deep as it's holy
Let's inspire, let's inflame, create gods from our pain
Find a love that's as sweet as it's holy
Let's inspire, let's inflame, create dreams from our pain
Find a love that's as plain as it's holy
Let's inspire, let's inflame, create songs from our shame
Find a love that won't fade, love is holy

But I can talk
(I can talk, I can talk, I can talk)
I can talk
(I can talk, I can talk, I can talk)
I can talk
(I can talk, I can talk, I can talk)
I can talk
(I can talk, I can talk, I can talk)
