I'm a broke-nose fighter
I'm a loose-lipped liar
Searching for the edge of darkness
But all I get is just tired

I went looking for attention
In all the wrong places
I was needing a redemption
And all I got was just cages

If I'm being real honest
I'm fighting uphill battles
I can't seem to find the right light
'Cause I've been living in the shadows

I went looking for attention
In all the wrong places
I was seeking recognition
But all I got was just cages

Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Looking back on all the wreckage
All I see is their faces
How many hearts have I broken?
And tell me, are they still breaking?

I went looking for attention
In all the wrong places
I was needing a redemption
Get me out of these cages

Oh, I had a bright white dream
Oh, It was pulling on me
Oh, 'till I was almost dead
Oh, here in these cages

There's a window in this cage I'm in
I can see what kind of man that I've been
I'm in a prison for a man gone wrong
But I've found a future, this is not my home

We're a band of outsiders
Spend our whole life chasing
Trying to climb a little higher
But the high just faded

Went looking for attention
In all the wrong places
We were needing a redemption
All we got was just cages
