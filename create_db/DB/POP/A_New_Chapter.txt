I walk these streets alone
I see the world around me changing
I'm in a dream
Faces that I knew
Are slowly turning into strangers
I've never seen
I read each line I turn the page
I laugh and cry at this true story
It's time for a new chapter to begin

Why does love fall easily for some
When will it ever come to me
How do I show you what burns inside my heart
I'm not just who you want me to be, to be

I hide out here sometimes
I watch the sunlight leave the skyline
Here I am safe
I close my eyes and sleep
Tomorrow brings another journey
That I will take
I read each line like it's the last
I know this book, this time has passed
I need a new chapter to begin

I walk these streets alone
I see the world around me changing
I'm in a dream
How do I show you what burns inside my heart
I'm not just who you want me to be, to be
