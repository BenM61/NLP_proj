Yo, what's up?
Leave your name and a brief message
And I'll be sure to get back with you, peace
"Tevin, I love you"

Shhh, break it down
I don't want nobody else to hear the sounds
This love is a private affair
Interrupt the flow, no they better not dare
Shhh, we got to break it on down

In the day time, uh, uh, I think not
I'd rather do you after school
Like some homework, am I gettin' you hot?
In my bedroom? No, 'cause then we have to stop
Please don't stop

I'd rather wait 'til everyone's fast asleep then do
It in the kitchen on the table top, oh
We got to break it on down, oh baby

Shhh, break it down
I don't want nobody else to hear the sounds
This love is a private affair
Interrupt the flow, no they better not dare
Shhh, we got to break it on down

Can you hear me?
We got to break it on down

Candlelight? No, I don't think so
The crackle of the flame will just spoil the flow
Besides, I can be your fire, baby
Drippin' all over like a ball of wax, relax and let go

Shhh, ooh, break it down
I don't want nobody else to hear the sounds
This love is a private affair
Interrupt the flow, no they better not dare
Shhh, we got to break it on down

Oh, goin' down
We got to break it on down
Break it down, baby

I'm here to do work, baby, so what you here to do?
I know you got somethin' special on your mind, is that true? Yeah
I'm here to do work, baby and I wanna do it with you

You say you wanna slow jam? Then listen up girl
I wanna whisper music in your ear
That'll rock your, rock your, rock your world, oh
What's my name, love? Tevin
I'll ask you again and again and again and again
'Til you scream, scream it, scream it, oh yeah

Break it on down, what's my name, baby?
Hear the sound, this is a secret, private affair
Nobody will know, better not dare
Oh yeah, you got to break it on down, down and down, oh
You got to break it on down
If you with this then let me hear you say, oh

Shhh, break it down
I don't want nobody else to hear the sounds
This love is a private affair
Interrupt the flow, no they better not dare
We got to break it on down, oh oh
We got to break it on down
I'm ready, are you?
