Hold it, baby, I turned you on
Now I can't turn you off
I turned you on
Now I can't turn you off

What a good, good feeling
A great sensation
You and me, baby
A good combination

Sock it to me

Baby, I started it
But I can't stop it
I admit that I started it, baby
Girl but I can't stop it

What a good, good feeling
A great sensation
You and me, baby
A good combination

Sock it to me

Get it, George

Sock it to me

I turned you on
Sock it to me

I turned you on
But I can't turn you off
Baby, I said, I turned you on
But I can't turn you off

Come on, girl, light my fire
Set me a little bit higher
Round and round and up and down we go
Where we gonna stop, baby, nobody knows

Sock it to me
Whip it to me
Give it to me
Sock it to me

Sock it to me
