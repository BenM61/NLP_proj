I believe someone up above
Made me just for you to love
Chose you, dear, from all the rest
They knew I'd love you best

Once I heard him say to me
Loneliness was meant to be
Make a wish on the stars above
And you'll find lasting love

Heaven must have heard my prayer
For when I looked I found you there
Now the world is mine at last
'Cause I found lasting love

Now each time you cling
Heaven offers eternity
Angels sing from above
They bless our lasting love

Heaven must have heard my prayer
For when I looked I found you there
Now the world is mine at last
'Cause I found lasting love

Now each time you cling
Heaven offers eternity
Angels sing from above
They bless our lasting love

They bless our lasting love
