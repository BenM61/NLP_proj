Goodbye  the future's sold out 
There's no use screaming 
Who thought we'd ever get this far 

Tonight  your faith has come down 
To money & a TV 
Psychics who've never been to mars 
And nazis breast feeding 
I know you must be upset 
I can't find meaning 
I'm sorry  we're sorry 
We're all scared  all scared 

Hey is anybody home 
Has anybody wasted tears on the 
loneliness 
That everyone becomes 

Goodnight, the truth has come out 
Everyone's needy 
White teeth, a ticket to meet god 
Be all that you envy 
The shotgun under your bed has 
Started breathing 
You shot it, you shot it 
I'm bare, I'm bare 

Hey, is anybody home 
Has anybody painted fear 
On the bedroom walls that save us 
from...
