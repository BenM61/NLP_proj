You don't know what you do to me
You don't know what you do to me
I don't know what I want to be
And I know what I want to be

You don't know what you do to me
You don't know what you do to me
I don't know what I want to be
You don't know what you do to me

(only when you sleep)
Can't believe it feels like
(only when you sleep)
Fight fire, can't forget
(only when you sleep)
All's changing, now its real
(only when you sleep)
Can't believe the way I feel

You don't know what you do to me
(only when you sleep)
You don't know what you do to me
(only when you sleep)
Couldn't stop if I made you see
(only when you sleep)
You don't know what you do to me

(only when you sleep)
Can't believe it feels like
(only when you sleep)
Fight fire, can't forget
(only when you sleep)
All's changing, now its real
(only when you sleep)
Can't believe the way I feel

Ever-lasting, still unchanging
Ever-lasting, still unchanging
Ever-lasting
Still

(only when you sleep)
Can't believe it feels like
(only when you sleep)
Fight fire, can't forget
(only when you sleep)
All's changing, now its real
(only when you sleep)
Can't believe the way I feel
(only when you sleep)

You don't know what you do to me
(only when you sleep)
You don't know what you do to me
(only when you sleep)
You don't know what you do to me
(only when you sleep)
You don't know what you do to me
