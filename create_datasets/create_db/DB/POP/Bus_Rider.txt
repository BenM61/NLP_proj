Get up in the morning, get on the bus
Get up in the morning like the rest of us
Places to go, important people to meet
Better not get up or you might lose your seat

(Bus rider)

Leave the house at six o'clock to be on time
Leave the wife and kids at home to make a dime
Grab your lunch pail, check for mail in your slot
You won't get your cheque if you don't punch the clock

(Bus rider)

(Bus rider)

Grab the evening paper, and sit down in your chair
Grab yourself a toupee, 'cause you're losing your hair
Doesn't matter what you do, you've nothing to lose
I'm so awful goddamn glad I'm not in your shoes

(Bus rider)

(Bus rider)
You know you'll ride it every single morning today
(Bus rider)
Ride, ride, little man
(Bus rider)
I don't want to ride, no I don't want to ride
(Bus rider)
Get up in the morning, get on the bus
(Bus rider)
Oh, little man riding upside down, yeah
(Bus rider)
Mm, no I don't want to ride
(Bus rider)
