Oh I was seventeen,
When I heard the countdown start, it started slowly,
And I thought it was my heart but then I realised,
That this time it was for real there was no place to hide,
I had to go out and feel,
But there was time to kill,
And so I, I walked my way around town,
I tried to love the world,
Oh but the world just got me down,
And so I looked for you,
In every street of every town I wanted to see your face,
I want to, I want to see you now.
I want to see you now.
Oh and so it went,
Oh so it went for several years I couldn't stand it
No, oh it must be getting near now that,
You just don't know,
Oh no you, you just don't understand how many people have seen you,
In the arms of, of of some other man,
I've got to meet you, and find you,
And take you by the hand, oh my God,
My God, you've got to understand,
That I was seventeen.
I didn't, I didn't know a thing at all.
I've got no reason,
I've got no reason at all, Oh no.
The time, of my life,
Oh I think you came too soon,
Yeah you came too soon then,
Oh and it could, it could be tonight,
If I ever leave this room,
(I never leave this room no)
Oh I wasted all my time on all those stupid things that only get me down,
Get down, oh.
Oh and the sky,
Is crying out tonight,
For me to leave this town,
So I'm gonna leave this town.
Goodbye.
O.K.
Yeah you can leave me,
Oh you, you can go some other place,
You can't forget it.
Yeah, you know, you know that's O.K.
'cause, 'cause I own this town,
Yeah, I brought it to its knees,
Can you hear it crying?
Can you?
Can you hear it begging to me "Please?"
I know it's coming,
So soon now
Oh, oh it's on it's way.
Oh no, oh no, oh I can hear them say,
They say I can't survive,
They say I, I'll never leave the ground,
They say it's all a lie,
And now, and now it's coming down,
Oh baby now,
Time, of my life, oh I think you came too soon.
Yeah you came too soon now,
Oh and it could, oh it could be tonight,
If I ever leave this room,
(I never leave this room now)
Oh oh oh
I wasted all my time on all those stupid things that only get me down.
Get down, oh
Oh and the sky, is crying out tonight,
For me to leave this town,
So I'm gonna go, gonna be there,
I'm gonna go.
Bub-bye.
It's O.K,
You don't have to care.
Really.
Oh, oh really, I swear,
No, no you owe me nothing,
You owe nothing to me,
And if I messed it up baby,
Then, that's all up to me.
And if you go, then, then I won't follow, no, no 
'cause so many times I've been,
I've been thinking maybe, oh maybe I should
No, I, I'm gonna stay
I, I'm gonna make my way
Oh, I'm gonna get on through babe
I'm gonna make it all some day
Oh, time, of my life,
No I think you came too soon,
You came too soon then.
Oh and it could, it could be tonight,
If I ever leave this room,
(I never, I never leave this room, no)
Oh oh oh
I wasted all my time on all those stupid things that only get me down
Get down, oh
And the sky, is crying out tonight,
For me to leave this town.
So I'll leave this town.
The sky, is crying out tonight,
For me to leave this town,
Yeah I'm gonna leave this town
Time
Is crying out tonight
For me to leave this town
So I'm gonna go yeah
I'm gonna go
Yeah
Bub-bye
I'm gonna leave this town
You're not gonna have me around
Oh
The sky and stars and God will never ever laugh
Me and stars and moon are falling down.
