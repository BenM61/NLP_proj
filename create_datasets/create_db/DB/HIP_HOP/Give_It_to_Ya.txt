The joy of children laughing around you
These are the makings

1, 2, it's like this
Little Brother, Pete Rock 
Another sure shot, another banger
Soul survivor part 2, for me and you, lets get it

I wanna rock with you
So get on the floor with me
I wanna give it to ya baby
I wanna rock with you
So get on the floor with me
I wanna give it to ya baby

Master of ceremony
Controlled territory
It's tay, the mad journalist always trying to write a better story
And laying tracks 'cause it's better for me
Calm but predatory, sun niggas even when the weathers stormy
My crew is down to do whatever for me
Got my back like scoliosis when I'm handling mine
Find it hard though to manage my time
Between examining rhymes, without severing my family ties
But yo! That's what happens when the world is loving you
Groupies skipping pills with ill plans of fucking you
A high price for fame that's non-refundable
All in the hopes of one day coming out with a "W"
I know it sound crazy right?
Even though it's hard sometimes I still got to stay in the mix
It's Pete Rock on the snair drums and laying the kicks
And on the real I wouldn't trade it for shit
Let's get it up right now, come on

I wanna rock with you
So get on the floor with me
I wanna give it to ya baby
I wanna rock with you
So get on the floor with me
I wanna give it to ya baby
Little brother we controlling it now

I got the magna rocks still heating up the spot
P.R. and L.B. got that shit for blocks
Hip-hop when we walk
Hop-hop when we talk
You can hear it our slang, and see the New York
We bought back '94 when the music was pure
Everybody made jams '93 and before
Hearing "Illmatic" first on the trip to the store
Lost my mind but I knew exactly what to work towards
Forward, on we move now, my life is the roof
Putting the pen to the pad when it's time to spread news
Daily digesting some more wack shit
Mother-fuckers better stick to the script
We need you back Jay
Y'all dudes know now we not for play
You want it funky come around my way
(For real) You can choose to rock or choose to roll
I chose Pete 'cause he got the soul
Yea lets get it going y'all

I wanna rock with you
So get on the floor with me
I wanna give it to ya baby
I wanna rock with you
So get on the floor with me
I wanna give it to ya baby

You at war with the king cobra 
Rapper Pooh el cap-i-tan, never roll a foot solider
We push over you pushovers
Lil' pussies need to douche over

Mass and Gills, Scott hare will make 'em gush over
Pussy and poetry two things that's good for ya
We rock hard just like the hood told us
That fake shit I never could show you
We ought to keep it true and authentic

In they videos trying to walk wit it
L.B. put the street talk in it
From right now 'til the day that we forfeit it

Just making sure that yall get it in time to put my heart in it
Little Brother crushing all gimmicks, like what

I wanna rock with you
So get on the floor with me
I wanna give it to ya baby
I wanna rock with you
So get on the floor with me
I wanna give it to ya baby

I wanna rock with you
So get on the floor with me
I wanna give it to ya baby
I wanna rock with you
So get on the floor with me
I wanna give it to ya baby
