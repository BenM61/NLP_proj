Take me to the Emerald City
Down yellow brick roads fast I run
Scarecrow friends will dance beside me
Tin toy brothers bright as sun

Take me to the Emerald City
Wizards will give us lemonade
It's a land of pleasures pretty
Ruby roses never fade

Children gather fragile flowers
Stars will sing a lullaby
You're an angel fly forever
Living life behind the sky

Take me to the Emerald City
Wizards will give us lemonade
It's a land of pleasures pretty
Ruby roses never fade

Rain it falls like tinsel teardrops
Rivers flow through jungles tall
Witches watch through magic mirrors
Frost and fog covers crystal balls

Take me to the Emerald City
Wizards will give us lemonade
It's a land of pleasures pretty
Ruby roses never fade

It's a land of pleasures pretty
Ruby roses never fade
