The snow is falling in a cold winter night 
Stars in the sky shining bright see the light 
Forget about the problems for one day in your life 
With your wife, your family, your friends and in harmony 
Let's come together help the sad and lonely through 
It could be me or you so what we gonna do 
Come and take my hand, let me understand 
Welcome to the Christmas land 

Merry Christmas, merry Christmas 
Feel the power of the silent night 
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas 
See the guiding star is shining so bright 
Oh oh oho 
We're celebrating Christmas 
Come and join the party of love 
Oh oh oho 
We're celebrating Christmas 
See the stars are shining above 

Who wants to spend Christmas time alone 
At home on your own sitting next to the phone 
Waiting for someone who's calling tonight 
To hold you tight, let the stars shine bright 
Feel the spirit, the power of love 
These emotional moments and the sky above 
Friends are together celebrating hand in hand 
Welcome to the Christmas land
