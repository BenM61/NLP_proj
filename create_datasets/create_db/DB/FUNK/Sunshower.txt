Sunshower, just a sign of the power
Of loving you, oh, baby
Sunshower, got me by the hour
Wanting you, oh, baby

When my eyes went out to you
I made up my mind
That every little thing I do
Be designed to glorify you

Ooh, my whole life through
I've been walking in the rain
Until that day, I chanced on you
And the sun came pouring down too

Sunshower, just a sign of the power
Of loving you, oh, baby
Sunshower, got me by the hour
Wanting you, oh, baby

Ooh, a passing word from you
Makes my day worthwhile
It takes all of my deadened dooms
On a ride to a faraway moon

On the dark and troubled sea
You gave me the light
And now I'm sailing so fast and free
Leaving stormy skies behind me

Sunshower, just a sign of the power
Of loving you, oh, baby
Sunshower, got me by the hour
Wanting you, oh, baby

Sunshower, just a sign of the power
Of loving you, oh, baby
Sunshower, got me by the hour
Wanting you, oh, baby

Sunshower, just a sign of the power
Of loving you, oh, baby
Sunshower, got me by the hour
Wanting you, oh, baby

Sunshower, just a sign of the power
Of loving you, oh, baby
Sunshower, got me by the hour
Wanting you, oh, baby

Sunshower, just a sign of the power
Of loving you
Sunshower, got me by the hour
Wanting you

Sunshower, just a sign of the power
Of loving you
Sunshower, got me by the hour
Wanting you
