You're my masterpiece, my priceless friend,
my inspiration, love 'til the end.
Like a ray of light, a flower in bloom,
you change the day, sun and moon.

Colour my life, ooh child you've got to
colour my life. Mmmm I said
colour my life.
Fill my canvas with everything nice.

Like a cactus flower in the desert sand,
an oasis of love in a desolate land,
our emotions flow, paint from a brush.
Sweet thing I love you oh so much.

Colour my life, ooh child you've got to
colour my life. Mmmm I said
colour my life.
Fill my canvas with everything nice.

Colour my life, ooh child you've got to
colour my life. Mmmm I said
colour my life. Mmmm I said,
Fill my canvas with everything nice.
