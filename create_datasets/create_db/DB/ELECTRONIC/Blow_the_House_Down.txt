All alone in the crowd, tryin' not to think out loud
Whispers shout, whispers scream, together we can make it a dream
Mountains high, mountains low, without a bridge you mind how you go
And what you need is what I want so don't be afraid, let it show
Don't be afraid, just let it explode

We have got the power to build the highest tower
Standing with our feet on the ground
We've got what it takes, together we can make it
Together we can blow the house down
Blow the house down (ooh ooh ooh)
Blow the house down, yeah
Blow the house down (ooh ooh ooh)
Blow the house, blow the house down

Silent words in your eyes, hiding in a lover's disguise
And as my heart steals your mind, together we'll be partners in crime
Deserts dry, don't you know, without the water no river flows
And what you need is what I want so don't be afraid, let it show
Don't be afraid, just let it explode

We have got the power to build the highest tower
Standing with our feet on the ground
We've got what it takes, together we can make it
Together we can blow the house down
Blow the house down (ooh ooh ooh)
Blow the house down, yeah
Blow the house down (ooh ooh ooh)
Blow the house, blow the house down

Mountains high, mountains low, without a bridge you mind how you go
And what you want is what I need so don't be afraid, let it show
Don't be afraid, just let it explode, woh

We have got the power to build the highest tower
Standing with our feet on the ground
We've got what it takes, together we can make it
Together we can blow the house down (blow the house down)

We have got the power to build the highest tower
