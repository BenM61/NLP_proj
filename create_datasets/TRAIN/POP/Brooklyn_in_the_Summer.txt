Remember we sat in the cold, no money in my Trio
Underneath that waterfall nobody else ever saw
I packed up everything except those memories
That only I can see, and can't get rid of
I still remember the first, your body hit every nerve
Used to wake up in my shirt, that's the one I had to burn
Trying not to stare, but you are everywhere
You're everywhere that I ever known

You feel like Brooklyn in the summer
Been hiding, half awake for so long
And it's the subtleties that only you've ever seen
Bringing the mess of me back together
You feel like Brooklyn in the summer
Been stumbling, half awake for so long
Gotta forget that feeling, give into something real
I've got, I've gotta let you go
Gotta let you go

This morning I walked to the train, just like you did every day
Everyone else is the same, I wonder if you're the same
And do you lay your head in someone else's bed
To help you bury it? Just like you always did
And now you're in all of my words, only way I can return
Memories fade in reverse, but you will always be heard
Wherever I can sing, you'll be right there with me
The notes and melodies that only I can see

You feel like Brooklyn in the summer
Been hiding, half awake for so long
And it's the subtleties that only you've ever seen
Bringing the mess of me back together
You feel like Brooklyn in the summer
Been stumbling, half awake for so long
Gotta forget that feeling, give into something real
I've got, I've gotta let you go

But maybe I'm not really ready to give up you
'Cause nobody ever mattered to me like you do
'Cause you're so up here, I caught that feeling
And touch the ceiling, ooh
I wish I could describe it with words just ain't enough
And nothing that I could say would ever measure up
But what I can't stand is you're outta my hands
And up outta your plans, ooh

You feel like Brooklyn in the summer
Been hiding, half awake for so long
And it's the subtleties that only you've ever seen
Bringing the mess of me back together
You feel like Brooklyn in the summer
Been stumbling, half awake for so long
Gotta forget that feeling, give into something real
I've got, I've gotta let you go
