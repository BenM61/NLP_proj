Its haunting
This hole that you have over me
I grow so weak

I see you
And everything around you fades
And I cant see

You can never know what it is you do to me

I can't take what you do to me
I can't take it

I can't take what you do to me
I can't take it

No matter what I say or what I do
I know how this will end
So I turn it away now before we begin

And now matter what you say or what you do
I know how this will end
So I'm turning away now

I'm dangerous for you
I'm dangerous for you

You touch me
And I can barely make a move
And I can't breathe

You never know what it is you do to me

I can't take what you do to me
I can't take it

I can't take what you do to me
I can't take it

No matter what I say or what I do
I know how this will end
So I'm turning away now before we begin

And no matter what you say or what you do
I know how this will end
So I'm turning away now

I'm dangerous

The only promise I could make
Is that my promise is a lie
The only promise I could make you
Is that my promise is a lie

No matter what I say or what I do
I know how this will end
So I'm turning away now before we begin

And no matter what you say or what you do
I know how this will end
So I'm turning away now

I'm dangerous for you
I'm dangerous for you
I'm dangerous for you
I'm dangerous for you
I'm dangerous for you
I'm dangerous for you

I'm dangerous, I'm dangerous for you

My promise is I will hurt you
My promise is I will hurt you
My promise is I will hurt you
My promise is I will hurt you
