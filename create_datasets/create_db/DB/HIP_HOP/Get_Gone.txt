Hey  come in here woman  sit down 
Come here 'cause we gotta talk 
I don't care  oh you just tense baby 
It gon' be all over tonight 
And I don't even know where to start 
No  want you to try to understand something girl 
Now just listen 

In the beginning you know I tried 
To make it work  but you and I 
Seems like I was always by myself 
Like you didn't ever  ever want to help 
The strain you put on me  you let me down 
Can you tell me why? 
After all I've done for you and us 
You know I really hate to say it 
But I gotta tell you something 

I think I better leave (leave) you alone (alone) 
So get your bags (yeah) and get the hell on (on) 
See because I don't want you no more 
I don't want you no more 

I think you better leave (leave) me alone (alone) 
So get your bags (yeah) and get the hell on (get gone) 
Because love ain't here no more 

I don't know if it hurts to hear me say 
All of these words, but then again 
I guess by now I really don't care 
(Said I've waited much too long) 
Oh, always thought that it could work 
Thought it could be forever you and me 
Tell me what happened to us 
Wait a minute, don't sleep, 'cause right now 
All I want to do is see.. 

You leaving (leave) me alone (alone) 
Get your bag (yeah) get the hell on (on) 
'cause I don't want you no more 

Said I think it's time to leave (leave) 
You alone (alone) get your bags (yeah) 
Get the hell on (get gone) 
'cause love ain't here no more 

See I tried to do it right 
Tried to make you see the light 
All that I wanted, all that I needed 
Was you in my life 
(All I needed was you in my life, whoa) 
Had me broke down and for what 
Tried so many times 
Forgot who the real me was 
But it's alright, I said it's cool 
'cause I'm getting rid of you 

I think it's time to leave (leave) 
Me alone (alone) get your bags (yeah) 
Get the f*ck on (on) 
Because I don't want you no more 

Said I think it's time to leave (leave) 
Me alone (alone) get yourself and (yeah) 
Get the hell on (Get gone) 
Love ain't here no more 

Oh leave (leave) me alone (alone) 
Get your bags (yeah) 
Leave the keys and the checkbook (on) 
I don't want you no more 
(See I've waited much too long) 

It's time to leave (leave) me alone (alone) 
Get your stuff and (yeah) get gone (get gone) 
'cause love ain't here no more
