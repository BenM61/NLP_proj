Ooh

You caught me
Lookin' at you
Forgive me
But if it's treasures
You're seeking
I'm the one who
Could reach them
It's not the kind of thing 
You wanna rush or hesitate
It could go 
Far
If you step to me
Just come at me
With honesty and you might be mine
Oh

Hold on, got it good baby
Believe me it's all good baby baby
Hold on, got it good baby
Believe me it's all good baby baby

Oh
So soft and
Effortlessly
I'm fallin'
So suddenly
You touch me
If it should be
I just might let in
Just think we could be anywhere
If I could choose
It'd be right here
And I don't let go easily
But something's taken over me

Hold on, got it good baby
Believe me it's all good baby baby
Hold on, got it good baby
Believe me it's all good baby baby

You're saying that our chemistry
Is poetry in motion
And whispering
So preciously
I second that emotion

Hold on, got it good baby
Believe me it's all good baby baby
Hold on, got it good baby
Believe me it's all good baby baby

Good
