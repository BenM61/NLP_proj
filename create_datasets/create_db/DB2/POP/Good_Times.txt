You don't even have to try
It comes easy for you
The way you move is so appealing it could make me cry
Go out drivin' with my friends
In bobby's big old beat up car
I'm with a lot of people then, I wounder were you are

Good times, bad times gimme some of that
Good times, bad times gimme some of that
Good times, bad times gimme some of that
Ooh woo ooh

I don't wanna say goodbye
Don't wanta walk ya to the door
I spent a little time with you, I want a little more

Good times, bad times gimme some of that
Good times, bad times gimme some of that
Good times, bad times gimme some of that
Ooh woo ooh

And baby really, I don't have to
I have to go anywhere right now
You want some more, you want some more of this
Anywhere where, were ever you want baby, just, 
Say it
Ah
Just say it

Good times, bad times gimme some of that
Good times, bad times gimme some of that
Good times, bad times gimme some of that
Ooh woo ooh

Now want those good, good ,good times
And got those bad, bad, bad times
I want those good, good, good ,good times
Gimme some that
