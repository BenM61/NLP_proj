Hide away hide away

Make sure that I never come back
Disappear and I never come back

I'm gonna pack up all my bags
Vanish while I can
Gonna leave this town behind
Pay it all no mind
I'm gonna fly away
And no one's gonna find me

Keep my destination quiet
Take an early morning flight
Never tell a soul
Just light out on my own
I'm gonna fly away
And no one's gonna find me

I'm gonna wear some fake disguise
Change the colour of my eyes
Yes I'm going hide away
And you're gonna be surprised
I'll be wise before my time
I'm going hide away

Make sure that I never come back
Disappear and I never come back
Make sure that I never come back
Disappear and I never come back

I'm gonna rent a small hotel
Throw away my cell
Cut off all my hair
Sweep away my cares
I'm gonna fly away
And no one's ever gonna find me

I'm out of everybody's reach
Out on some twisted beach
I'm gonna hide away
Dissolve right out this scene
Out of everybody's dreams
I'm gonna hide away
Hide away (cont)

Hide away

Make sure that I never come back
Disappear and I never come back
Make sure that I never come back
Disappear and I never come back
