It's hard enough, I know
To find the strength to go
Back to where it all began
It's hard to enough to gain
Any traction in the rain
You know it's hard for me to understand 

Hard to find a way
To get through another city day
Without thinking about
Gettin' out 

Now the strangest thing I've seen
Was a t-shirt turning green
In envy of turtle dove
The dove's lady was the cause
Or maybe it was the olive branch she held in her claws
Or maybe he could see they were in love 

You know it's hard for me to find a way
To get through another city day
Without thinking about
Gettin' out
