Under neon lights
Under neon lights
Got no husband
Got no wife
All I want
All I want
All I want
Is this really all I want?

Let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go

And she moves to suicide
In and under neon lights
Got no husband, got no wife
All I want's a view tonight
All I want's a view tonight
All I want's a view tonight
All I want's a view tonight
All I want's a view tonight

Let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go

Eye to eye, face to face
I guess this is Heaven
Got no pride, got no name
I guess this is Heaven
I guess I'm in Heaven
Oh I guess I'm in Heaven

And she moves to suicide
In and under neon lights
Got no husband, got no wife
All I want's a view tonight
All I want's a view tonight
All I want's a view tonight
All I want's a view tonight
All I want's a view tonight
Got no husband, got no wife
All I want's a view tonight
All I want's a view tonight
All I want's a view tonight

As she moves to suicide
Under neon lights
Got no husband
Got no wife
All I want
All I want
All I want
Is this really all I want?
