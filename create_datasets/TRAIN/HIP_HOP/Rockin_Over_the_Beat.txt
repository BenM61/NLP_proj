Oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh yeah

Rollin' under the melody, rockin' over the beat
As I'm checkin' up on the rhythm
And make the whole sound sweet
Not like candy you taste that so you can be
YMCO music is good to the truth and you agree

Get into the sound, keep rollin' the tune
Feel like rockin' the whole track through 
Just stand only for you
Get into the sound, keep rollin' the tune
Feel like rockin' the whole track through 
Just stand only for you

Over and on and on and on and on and on and
Over us all and all to all for all and all to

Each for me and I for y'all
United we stand, divided we fall
One for all and all for one
United we stand, we'll get the job done
Each for me and I for y'all
United we stand, divided we fall
One for all and all for one
United we stand, we'll get the job done

(Rockin' to the beat, turn it up, oh)
(Rockin' to the beat, turn it up, oh)

Rollin' under the melody, rockin' over the beat
Rockin', rollin' under the melody
And make the whole sound neat and sweet
Yes, from me to you, you taste that
Say it's too good to be true
One for all and all for one and you agree

Get into the sound, keep rollin' the tune
Feel like rockin' the whole track through 
Just stand only for you
Get into the sound, keep rollin' the tune
Feel like rockin' the whole track through 
Just stand only for you

Rollin' under the melody, rockin' over the beat
As I'm checkin' up on the rhythm
And make the whole sound sweet
Not like candy you taste that so you can be
YMCO music is good to the truth and you agree

Get into the sound, keep rollin' the tune
Feel like rockin' the whole track through 
Just stand only for you
Get into the sound, keep rollin' the tune
Feel like rockin' the whole track through 
Just stand only for you
Get into the sound, keep rollin' the tune
Feel like rockin' the whole track through 
Just stand only for you
Get into the sound, keep rollin' the tune
Feel like rockin' the whole track through 
Just stand only for you

Rollin' under the melody, rockin' over the beat
As I'm checkin' up on the rhythm and make 
The whole sound sweet
Not like candy you taste that so you can be
YMCO music is good to the truth and you agree

(Rockin' to the beat, turn it up)
Over and on and on and on and on and on and
(Rockin' to the beat, turn it up)
(Rockin' to the beat, turn it up)
It's all over your life there, hey yeah, hey yeah
(Rockin' to the beat, turn it up)

Rollin' under the melody, rockin' over the beat
Rockin', rollin', rollin', rockin', rockin', rollin', rollin', rock

Get into the sound, keep rollin' the tune
Feel like rockin' the whole track through 
Just stand only for you
Get into the sound, keep rollin' the tune
Feel like rockin' the whole track through 
Just stand only for you
(Stand only for you) just stand only for you

(Stand only for you)
Over and on and on and on and on and on and
Not like candy
