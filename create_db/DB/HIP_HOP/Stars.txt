How did we ever go this far 
You touched my hand and start the car 
And for the first time in my life, I am crying 
Are we in space do we we belong 
Some place where no-1 calls it wrong 
And like the stars who burn away 
The miles 

How did we ever get this far 
It shouldn't have to be this hard 
Now for the first time in my life am flying 
Are we in love? Do we deserve 
To bear the shame of this whole world 
And like the night we camouflage denial
