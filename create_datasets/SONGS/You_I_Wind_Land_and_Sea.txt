More I need to work 
Get up out your head 
The sun will soon be rising 
The light's no longer red 
We walk the street 
We ain't got time to play 

Standing for our reasons 
Our time has come at last 
To bring it down to bottom 
Let the wind show us the path 
This time we can see 
We ain't got time to play 

Rising comes the moon and the sun 
I'll be alright for now 
A thousand buffalo on the run 
Stand up and fight for now 

Over any distance 
The sun will disappear 
Darkness with its powers 
Taking over anything that fears 
You plant that seed 
The light is on the way 

Not for another moment 
We must not divide 
Harmony is what we need 
Between both you and I wind land and sea 
The light is on the way 

Rising comes the moon and the sun 
I'll be alright for now 
Ten thousand buffalo on the run 
Stand up and fight for now 
Hold my hand I know you're the one 
Stand up and fight for now 
The rising of our generation 
Stand up and fight for now
