Baby, I've been downhearted
Ever since the day we met 
Baby, I've been downhearted 
Ever since the day we met 
Our love is nothing but the blues
Baby, how blue can you get? 

My love burns like a fire
Your love burn like a cigarette
Yes, my love burns like a fire
Your love burn like a cigarette
Yes, I've seen you put it down and crush it
Baby, how blue can you get?

Oh, you're evil when I'm with you, baby
And you are jealous when we're apart 
Yes you're evil when I'm with you, baby 
And you are jealous when we're apart 
How blue can you get, baby?
The answer's right here in my heart 

I gave you a brand-new Ford 
You said "I want a Cadillac"
I bought you a ten dollar dinner 
You said "thanks for the snack" 
I let you live in my penthouse 
You said it was just a shack 
I gave you seven children 
And now you want to give them back 
I've been downhearted, baby 
Ever since the day we met
Our love is nothing but the blues 
Tell me, how blue can you get?
