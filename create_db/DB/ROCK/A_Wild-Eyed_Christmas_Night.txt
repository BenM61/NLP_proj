Now all year long we've been waiting for the season to come 
Working and savin', dreamin' 'bout the Christmastime fun 
Now the presents are under the tree 
I've been as good as I can be 
Let's call the gang over 
Sounds like a party to me 

While the little elves are workin' and the kids are in bed 
Reindeer are flyin' way up over our heads 
Everything is peaceful 
The stars are clear and bright 
We're gonna throw a party, celebrate the new year 
Just get some 38 Special holiday cheer 
This house will be a-rockin' on a wild-eyed Christmas night

Well we got a few hours till Santa starts comin' our way 
He's tunin' up his reindeer; the elves are loadin' the sleigh 
The mistletoe is hangin' above 
And everybody's lookin' for love 
So baby come a rockin' the moonlight's slippin' away 

While the little elves are workin' and the kids are in bed 
Reindeer are flyin' way up over our heads 
Everything is peaceful 
The stars are clear and bright 
We're gonna throw a party, celebrate the new year 
Just get some 38 Special holiday cheer 
This house will be a-rockin' on a wild-eyed Christmas night

So baby, get ready, get dressed, it's time to rock 
Once the music starts pumpin', you won't be able to stop 
Right about quarter to four 
Just when we can't take anymore 
He'll be comin' down the chimney, just when we're ready to drop 

While the little elves are workin' and the kids are in bed 
Reindeer are flyin' way up over our heads 
Everything is peaceful 
The stars are clear and bright 
We're gonna throw a party, celebrate the new ye
