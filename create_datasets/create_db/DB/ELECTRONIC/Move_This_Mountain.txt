What do you want from me?
I stand before you 
No attempt to leave
I'm too tired to disagree
I stand before you 
No chance I'll believe this warning

Oh do you know,
I would have done anything for you

Take this chance I won't repeat this
I can do anything that's put beside of you
And I can move any mountains that you make
I'll lift you up and my back will never break
And I can move this mountain

Come and take the rest of me
I never thought I wouldn't want you near
This is all I'll ever be
I understand you
Look around to see this dawning

Oh, does it show?
I wanted to catch you falling
Oh, do you know
I would have done anything for you

Take this chance I won't repeat this
I can do anything that's put beside of you
And I can move any mountains that you make
I'll lift you up and my back will never break
And I can move this mountain
