A juxtaposition in fate
Find our mutual coordinates

Moments of clarity are so rare
I better document this
Across the view is fears
All that matters is

Who is open-chested
And who has coagulated
Who can share and
Who has shot down the chances?

Show me emotional respect, oh respect, oh respect
And I have emotional needs, oh needs, oh ooh
I wish to synchronize our feelings, our feelings, oh ooh

What is it that I have
That makes me feel your pain
Like milking a stone
To get you to say it and

Who is open?
And who has shut up
And if one feels closed
How does one stay open?

We have emotional needs, oh needs, oh needs, oh ooh
I only wish to synchronize our feelings, our feelings, ooh
I'll show some emotional respect, oh respect, oh ooh

A juxtaposition in fate
Find our mutual coordinates
