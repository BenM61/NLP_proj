Ever since we parted, I've been downhearted
Whoever thought that I would miss you so
Oh please come back I beg, please baby please
What fools are we who cannot see the forest for the trees
Now I am the one that I outsmarted and I am downhearted
I lost the truest love I'll ever know
Oh how I yearn to hold you in my arms once again
And I will be downhearted till then.

Oh please come back I beg you, please baby please
What fools are we who cannot see the forest for the trees
Now I am the one that I outsmarted and I'm downhearted
I lost the truest love I'll ever know.
Oh how I yearn to hold you in my arms once again
And I will be downhearted till then
