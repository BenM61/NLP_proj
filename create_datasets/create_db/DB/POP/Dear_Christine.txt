'Twas one long year today 
I left Bournemouth and you 
Adventure, salt and spray 
King's service I must do 
But dear Christine I hold you dearly 
If only you could hear me 
I send my love sincerely 
In hopes that we're not merely hanging on 

At sea there's time for thought 
My head was filled with you 
With quill in hand I sought 
To bridge the endless blue 

But dear Christine I hold you dearly 
If only you could hear me 
I send my love sincerely 
In hopes that we're not merely hanging on 
On and on 

And dear Christine I'm just a man who 
Believes in dreams that come true 
And if you feel like I do 
When I return I'll find you hanging on
