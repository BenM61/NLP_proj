My first and last time with you
And we had some fun
Went walking through the trees, yeah
And then I kissed you once

Oh, I want to see you soon
But I wonder how
It was a new day yesterday
But it's an old day now

Spent a long time looking
For a game to play
My luck should be so bad now
To turn out this way

Ah, I had to leave today
Just when I thought I'd found you
It was a new day yesterday
But it's an old day now

Spent a long time looking
For a game to play
My luck should be so bad now
To turn out this way

Ah, I had to leave today
Just when I thought I'd found you
It was a new day yesterday
It was a new day yesterday
It was a new day yesterday
But it's an old day now
