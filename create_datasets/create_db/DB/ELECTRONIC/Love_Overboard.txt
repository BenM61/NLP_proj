They tell me, Gladys, you know you love too hard
But I tell 'em, not nearly hard enough
They say, girlfriend, you know you go too far
Around the world ain't far enough

'Cause I only wanna show you, what you mean to me
Every time I'm reachin' out to you, I start to sink
I may be drowning with desire from your sweet, sweet touch
I don't care what people say 'cause I love you so much

Love overboard
My love's in need of help
Love overboard
I sure can't help myself

Love overboard
I don't know what to do
Love overboard
I'm so in love with you, baby

Baby, they say I work too hard
Not really, when it comes to lovin' you
You've got my overtime, you bring me peace of mind
And there's so much more I'd like to do

I only wanna find the love my heart's been searchin' for
I'd climb most every mountain swim from shore to shore
Just to feel the soft caress from your warm embrace
In this ocean of love, no one can take your place

Love overboard
Oh, my love's in need of help
Love overboard
Sure can't help myself

Love overboard
I don't know what to do
Love overboard
So in love with you

Love overboard
I'm running out of time
Love overboard
I'm 'bout to lose my mind

Love overboard
I don't know what to do
Love overboard
I'm so in love with you

All my friends keep telling me to let you go
Between the two of us how could they ever know
About the love you been givin'?

Seems some people like to live their life so very close
I like to let go sometime, so I can flow with the time
I've done made up my mind, you're the only one for me
Oh, my love's overboard

(Gladys, Gladys, Gladys)
I'm overboard
Can't help myself
I'm overboard

Uh, the bottom may be deep
But your love, so very sweet
Well overboard

Love overboard
Love overboard
So in love with you

Love overboard
Runnin' out of time
Love overboard
About to lose my mind

Love overboard
I don't know what to do
Love overboard
So in love with you

Spinnin', fallin'
People, aah, people
Love's callin', I'm fallin'
S-O-S-O-S-O-S-O-S

Love's overboard
My love's in need of help
Love overboard
I just can't help myself

Love overboard
I don't know what to do
Love overboard
