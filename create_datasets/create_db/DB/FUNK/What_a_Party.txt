Where was Jodie when the lights went out? 
Standing in the corner shouting "Shout, sister, shout!" 
What a party! Lordy, Lordy! 
(Big fat guy, oh man, he sure could wail away!) 
What a party! Lordy, Lordy! 
(Big fat guy, oh man, he sure could play!) 

The girl wore a dress with no shoes on 
The big tenor man really blew his horn 
What a party! Lordy, Lordy! 
(Big fat guy, oh man he sure could wail away!) 
What a party! Lordy, Lordy! 
(Big fat guy, oh man, he sure could play!) 

Somebody called a cop about half past four 
He really just couldn't get through that door 
What a party! Lordy, Lordy! 
(Big fat guy, oh man he sure could wail away!) 
What a party! Lordy, Lordy! 
(Big fat guy, oh man, he sure could play!)
