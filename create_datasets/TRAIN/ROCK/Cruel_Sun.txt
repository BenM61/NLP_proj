See the bloody faces lifted to the sky
Do you want to run to a future left behind?
I remember asking why, there lies aggression.
Separation where there should be love
Power plays while the people die

Let it rain and protect us from this cruel sun
Let it rain and protect us from this cruel sun

I remember asking why, there lies aggression
Separation where there should be love
Power plays while the people die
I remember asking why, I remember asking why
I remember asking why, I remember asking why, why.

Open up your eyes, your eyes and let the child learn.
Open up your eyes, and let the child learn

Let it rain and protect us from this cruel sun
Let it rain and protect us from this cruel sun

Why does war kill only the small man?
Why does war kill only the small man?
I think we know, yes, we know
I think we know, know, know

I remember asking why.
I remember asking why.
I remember asking why.

Let it rain and protect us from this cruel sun
Let it rain and protect us from this cruel sun
