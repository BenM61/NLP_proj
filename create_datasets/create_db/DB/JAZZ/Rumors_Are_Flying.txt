Rumors are flying
That you've got me sighing
That I'm in a crazy kind of a daze
A lazy sort of a haze
When I go walking
I hear people talking
They say our affair is not just a passing phase

And they whisper 'bout the flowers
You keep sending me by the dozen
And they wonder 'bout the hours
That you spend with me, it keeps them buzzin'

Rumors are flying
And I'm not denying
That people are sure I'm falling in love with you
'Cause for a change, darling
All the rumors are true

And they whisper all about the flowers
The many little flowers you keep sending me by the dozen
And they wonder all about the hours
That you spend with your baby, what do you do, do, do
That keeps 'em buzzin' all the time, all the time

Rumors are flying
And I'm not denying
That people are sure I'm falling in love with you
'Cause for a change, darling
All the rumors are true
