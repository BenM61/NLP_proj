I had an argument at work
I was pretty fed up
My head began to hurt
And the pain just wouldn't let up

But knew that I would feel better
Once I heard from you, you
Then you hit me on my cell
And said that we were going
Out when I get off

Just what I was hoping
You must have read my mind
Something that you often do

Again you saved the day
By knowing what to say
You're always coming through
The times I most need you

Like the other day
There was deposit
Put into my account
And I knew nothing about it

When I asked you you why you did it
You said that it was just because I love you

Again you saved the day
By knowing what to say
You're always coming through
The times I most need you

I'm so glad I finally
Met someone who cares for me
The way that you do
Again you saved the day
