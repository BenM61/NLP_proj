Hey DJ
Oh-oh-oh-oh

I just wanna be a good man, good man to you, girl
That's all I want babe, ay
That's all I want to be, baby
That's all I want to be, baby
So I just wanna be a good man, good man to you, girl
That's all I want babe, baby
That's all I want to be, baby
That's all I want to be, babe

So I just wanna pick the phone up
Every single time you call
Then no matter where I'm in
I wanna be chillin with Obama talkin' business and see you callin' and tell him 
"Hold up I gotta take this"
Let the world wait
Wanna wear it like the middle
Tell 'em I'm a spoken for fellow
Ladies say, "Hello" like I'm who they want to be with
I do everything with my left, I know you'll see it trifiling
Listen baby I ain't nowhere near perfect
But I promise to promise to make it all worth it
Giving you the things to be the man you deservin'
Makin' sure you're smiling, way more than you're hurting
Taking my time to hear you when you're talkin'
Remindin' how bad you are
Keep them legs shakin' making lovin'. makin' sure you understand
That is in my plan

So I just wanna be a good man, good man to you, girl
That's all I want to be, baby
That's all I want to be, baby
That's all I want to be
So I just wanna be a good man, good man to you, girl
That's all I want babe
That's all I want to be, baby
That's all I want to be, oh

Tell the truth, tell the whole damn truth
Never leavin' out the parts I know gon' upset you
Never doin' things that I ain't got no business doin'
When you 'round, when you not around
I respect you and I will never make a fool out you baby (no, no)
No, I'll never make a fool out you baby (no, no)
I'm making sure you can trust me beyond a shadow of a doubt
So when them broads run up on you, with my name in they mouth
You tell 'em you could be gone with all that
'Cause you know what we got is beyond all that
You know we got that real thing, real thing
Gon' be the object of some hatin', hatin'
Hey, but we gon' be alright, we gon' be alright
Making love after every fight
Girl from the day I put the ring up on your hands
In front of friends and fans

I had a plan and my plan is to be a good man, good man to you, girl
That's all I want to be, babe
That's all I want to be, baby
That's all I want to be
Say I wanna be a good man, good man to you, girl
That's all I want to be
Said it's all I want to be, baby
All I want to be, oh

Oh baby, I wanna be a good man to you baby, ooh
