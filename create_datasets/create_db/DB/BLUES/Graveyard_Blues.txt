You know they tell me the graveyard, graveyard
Is a low down dirty place
You know they tell me the graveyard, graveyard
Is a low down dirty place
They takin' my baby to the graveyard
And they pack dirt in her face

I followed that long black wagon, long black wagon down to the graveyard
Watched them pack dirt in my baby's face

Mr. Graveyard Digger, why you wanna take my baby away?

I waved bye-bye, bye at my baby
As they was lettin' her down in her grave (yes I did)
Lettin' her down, lettin' her down in her grave

I'm gonna bring you some flowers baby, bring you some flowers
On every decoration day, baby
Gonna decorate your grave baby
On every decoration day
Poor me, poor me, poor me
Mm poor me, poor, poor me
I ain't got nobody baby
I ain't got nobody baby
All I got in the world
Have passed away
My baby gone
Have passed away
