Sometimes I think I love you, aw, just a little too much
You know you thrill me, baby, with your magic touch
That's why I want you, honey, and love you like I do
I'm gonna scream and shout it
There ain't no doubt about it
That's why I love you like I do (like I do)

Well, sometimes I think you kiss me, aw, just a little too much
You drive me crazy, baby, with your magic touch

 You make me feel so good when the moon is shinin' bright
 With our lips together and you're squeezin' me so tight
 Well, I went steady once before, though I'd love the girl next door
 She stepped out on me, you see, and couldn't be true
 But I got over all my dreams, time went by so fast, it seems
 But now I know I'll never get over you

(SPOKEN:) all right
Well, sometimes I think I love you, aw, just a little too much
You know you thrill me, baby, with your magic touch
That's why I want you, honey, and love you like I do
I'm gonna scream and shout it
There ain't no doubt about it
That's why I love you like I do (like I do)

Yeah, that's why I love you like I do (like I do)
