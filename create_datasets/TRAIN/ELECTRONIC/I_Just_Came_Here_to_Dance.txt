I was feelin' lonely and I was new in town
I was just lookin' for a friend
When the music started and you stepped out of the crowd
My heart just opened up and let you in

I just came here to dance
Never knew I'd find a lover
I just came here to dance
But now I can't recover

I was caught up in the music
Can't deny the magic in your eyes
I wasn't tryin' to find romance
I just came here to dance

I maybe talkin' crazy, maybe I'm insane
To lose my heart so easily
But when we started dancin' and I held you in my arms
I'll never know just what came over me

I just came here to dance
Never knew I'd find a lover
I just came here to dance
But now I can't recover

I was caught up in the music
Can't deny the magic in your eyes
I wasn't tryin' to find romance
I just came here to dance

Oh, it felt so right, holdin' you so tight
Spinnin' round and round
When the night was through, it was me and you
And the new love we have found

I just came here to dance
I just came here to dance

I was caught up in the music
Can't deny the magic in your eyes
I wasn't tryin' to find romance
I just came here to dance

I just came here to dance
You know I didn't know, did I
I wasn't tryin' to find romance
I just came here to dance

(Just came here)
You know I didn't know, did I
(Did I say)
I just came here to dance

(Just came here)
You know I didn't know, did I
(Did I say)
I wasn't tryin' to find romance
(I wasn't tryin' to find romance)
