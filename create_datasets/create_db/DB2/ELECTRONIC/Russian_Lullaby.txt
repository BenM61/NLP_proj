Priviet! Menya zavut E-Type! Nazdarovie!

When the seas are rolling in
When the stars are shining clear
When the ghosts are howling near
When we sing the Russian lullaby

In the night, in the night

Let's you and me together leave for higher ground
When you are all alone just listen to the sound

Lullaby,
we fall asleep when we hear...
Lullaby,
we fly away when we hear...
Lullaby,
we travel far when we hear...
Lullaby,
when we hear the Russian lullaby...

In the night, when the seas are rolling in
In the night, when the stars are shining clear
In the night, when the ghosts are howling near
In the night, when we sing the Russian lullaby

In the night, in the night

When we are going through the night in search of light
Let's you and me enjoy the mach 5 speed of life

Lullaby,
we fall asleep when we hear...
Lullaby,
we fly away when we hear...
Lullaby,
we travel far when we hear...
Lullaby,
when we hear the Russian lullaby...

In the night, when the seas are rolling in
In the night, when the stars are shining clear
In the night, when the ghosts are howling near
In the night, when we sing the Russian lullaby

In the night
We fall asleep when we hear...
In the night
We fly away when we hear...
In the night
We travel far when we hear...
In the night
When we sing the Russian lullaby...

When the seas are rolling in
In the night, when the stars are shining clear
In the night, when the ghosts are howling near
In the night, when we sing the Russian lullaby

When we sing the Russian lullaby
When we sing the Russian lullaby
