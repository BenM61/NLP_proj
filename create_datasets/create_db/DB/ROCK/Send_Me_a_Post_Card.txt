Before loneliness 
Will break my heart 
Send me a postcard,darling 
How can I make you understand 
I wanna be your woman 

Here I'm waiting for a little sign 
Waiting till the end of time 
Send me a postcard,darling 
Send me a postcard now 

I can't taste a lonely night 
I need someone I can turn to 
Look out for the day I get a little sign 
I want to know your own mind 
Now 

Now please don't let me down 
Ain't no lover like me in town 
Send me a postcard,darling 
Send me a postcard now
