We put them in the park and we told them to hold on tight
Let go of them
Let go of them
Let go of them

Cause you are the ?
One that only eyes will chase
And just the right rhymes
Struggling as always
And we were just across the road
Now that you're colder
Now that you're colder

So sick to death of this
Safe to say never wanted you more
And you asked for one more go
So sick to death of this

Safe to say never wanted you more
And you asked for one more go

Cause you are the ?
One that only eyes will chase
And just the right rhymes
Struggling as always
And I was just across the road
We put them in the park and we told them to hold on tight
And I was just across the road
And now that you're colder
And now that you're colder

So sick to death of this..
..safe to say never wanted you more
And you asked for one more go
She had the answer, she had the answer
Cause she lying on the road
She's lying on the road
So sick to death of this

Safe to say never wanted you more
And you asked for one more go
She had the answer, she had the answer
Cause she lying on the road
She's lying on the road!

And I was hoping on a good day that you would be fine
And I was hoping on a good day that you would be fine
And I was hoping on a good day that you would be mine
And we were hoping on a good day that they would be fine
