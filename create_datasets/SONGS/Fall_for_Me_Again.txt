All our friends been acting strange
Sunshine smiles - even when it rains
And they pretend that they don't see
The trouble with you and me
But they know you're about to leave

And even you have played a part
Of someone who is still true at heart
Do you think that I don't know
Your love for me turned cold
How sad to see you go ...But

I'm hoping that you'll fall in love again
And never look back on what might have been
I pray that we will stay the best of friends
And in my heart I hope that you will fall for me again

But don't say there is no way
The things you loved before haven't changed
Well I could find somebody new
Who wouldn't tear my heart in two
But I'd never get over you ... Oh, No ... So

So I'm hoping that you'll fall in love again
And never look back on what might have been
I pray that we will stay the best of friends
And in my heart I hope that you will fall for me again
