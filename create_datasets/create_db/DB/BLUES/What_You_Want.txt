What you want to say
Wait till you get home 
I'm sick of communicating over the telephone
But tell me how you feel
For I am lonely too
Need you to know
I'm just as cold and numb as you 

But I could fly away
Or I could be no one 
And you could be the sunshine falling over the mountains 

Or you could come to stay 
You could come right home 
I don't see why I have to 
Live this life all alone

I know there is a way to make up for old mistakes 
I know what's happening is for a reason 
I 
I 
I
