Hello, hello, hello, hello heartbreak
Hello, hello, hello, hello heartbreak

I got a strange connection to pain
I can't seem to walk away from hurt
I'm always running into dangers

I know I need protection in chain
But it's affection's what I long for
(Hello, hello, hello, hello heartbreak)
It cuts me deep but I'm still wanting more

Hello heartbreak, it's good to see you
Happiness came but it just lets me down, lets me down
(Hello, hello, hello, hello heartbreak)
(Hello, hello, hello, hello heartbreak)

Hey there sadness, I know I need you
'Cause when all else fails you'll always be around, be around
(Hello, hello, hello, hello heartbreak)
(Hello, hello, hello, hello heartbreak)

Hello, hello, hello, hello heartbreak
Hello, hello, hello, hello heartbreak

I got this huge attraction to you
I must be going out my mind, wasting time
(Hello, hello, hello, hello heartbreak)
I'm aching deep inside

Hello heartbreak, it's good to see you
Happiness came but it just lets me down, lets me down
(Hello, hello, hello, hello heartbreak)
(Hello, hello, hello, hello heartbreak)

Hey there sadness, I know I need you
'Cause when all else fails you'll always be around, be around
(Hello, hello, hello, hello heartbreak)
(Hello, hello, hello, hello heartbreak)

Hello heartbreak, it's good to see you
Happiness came but it just lets me down, lets me down
(Hello, hello, hello, hello heartbreak)
(Hello, hello, hello, hello heartbreak)

Hey there sadness, I know I need you
'Cause when all else fails you'll always be around, be around
(Hello, hello, hello, hello heartbreak)
(Hello, hello, hello, hello heartbreak)

Hello, hello, hello, hello heartbreak
Hello, hello, hello, hello heartbreak
