There wasn't anything I didn't love about you,
You'd do some stupid things and I'd laugh at those too,
And we went together like the summer in June
But who'd have known that it'd rain so soon

Thought I'd be the only one that'd make you smile,
Thought I'd be the only one that'd really know how
But you showed me different and I know better now,
I gotta get you out my system somehow

I replay it over and over again
You were my girl, now we 'ain't even friends,
You could've been my all or nothing, all or nothing,
Now to me you're nothing, girl you are nothing, now you're nothing

Put you on a pedestal, girl I held you so high
Was never too good at finding the words to describe,
Just how I felt for you but you know that I tried,
But somehow we went and changed inside

You damn near were my everything you're still on my mind,
But I'd rather be here all alone and I'm doin' just fine
Gotta take it back to the days before we met
And live our lives as strangers again

I replay it over and over again
You were my girl, now we 'ain't even friends,
You could've been my all or nothing, all or nothing,
Now to me you're nothing, girl you are nothing, now you're nothing

I replay it over and over again
You were my girl, now we 'ain't even friends,
You could've been my all or nothing, all or nothing,
Now to me you're nothing, girl you are nothing, now you're nothing

December days, my summer turned to winter
When you went away, I can't help but wonder
Was he worth my pain, you should know better, and I should've too
And I cried, and you cried and we tried to make it work,
Almost died while we tried, is that what our love was worth,
If I could do it again, I would be a better man,
Now I'm living with just memories

I replay it over and over again
You were my girl, now we 'ain't even friends,
You could've been my all or nothing, all or nothing,
Now to me you're nothing, girl you are nothing, now you're nothing

I replay it over and over again
You were my girl, now we 'ain't even friends,
You could've been my all or nothing, all or nothing,
Now to me you're nothing, girl you are nothing, now you're nothing
