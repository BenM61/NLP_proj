I see a new sun up in a new sky
And my whole horizon has reached a new high
Yesterday, my heart sang a blue song
But today, hear it hum a cheery new song

I dreamed a new dream, I saw a new face
And I'm spreading sunshine all over the place
With a new point of view, here's what greets my eye
New love, new luck, new sun in the sky

I see a new sun up in a new sky
And my whole horizon has reached a new high
Yesterday, my heart sang a blue song
But today, hear it hum a cheery new song

I dreamed a new dream, I saw a new face
And I'm spreading sunshine all over the place
With a new point of view, here's what greets my eye
New love, new luck, new sun in the sky
