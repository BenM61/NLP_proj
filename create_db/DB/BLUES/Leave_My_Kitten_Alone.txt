You better leave (meow) my kitten alone (meow, meow)
You better leave (meow, meow) my kitten alone (meow, meow)
I done told you big bad bulldog
You better leave her alone (meow, meow)

Don't you know my kitten is a dream?
Don't you know my kitten is a dream?
So, get your hands off of her 'cause I'm her lovin' man

Mr. Dog, I'm gonna hit you on the top a yo' head
The Batgirl's gonna miss you
And you'll wish that you were dead

If you don't leave my kitten alone
Yes, I love my little kitten
Like you hound dogs love your bone
