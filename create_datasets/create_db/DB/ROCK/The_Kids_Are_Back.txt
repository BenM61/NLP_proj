We walk the streets in tattered armies
We got the lion in our heart
We're not lookin' for trouble, just for some fun
But we're all ready if you want to start


So, just remember the
The kids are back
The kids are back
Oh, watch out
The kids are back

Well, can you blame us for living our dreams?
Just look around and you'll see why
We don't want to follow that same routine
Maybe it's for nothin', but we gotta try


Look out

Solo - Eddie

Now there's no problem, no need to fuss
We ain't out to stop your fun
Don't mind us askin', 'cause we gotta know
How can we stop it when you're havin' none?


The kids are back
The kids are back
The kids are back
