So what is the answer to the question of you
What do I look for, what shall I do?
Which way do I turn when I'm feeling lost?
If I sell my soul, now what will it cost?
Must I become naked? No image at all?
Shall I remain upright? Or get down and crawl?

All of the questions in my life will be answered
When I decide which road to choose
What is the answer to the question of you?

You
