I know that you want me, you know that I want you
The memories haunt me, I know that they haunt you too
But it's alright, you'll be fine
Baby, it's alright, you'll be fine
As long as you're mine, take a look at the time
It gets cold at night, when you're alone outside
But it's fine, I'll be fine
Pay me no mind, girl, pay me no mind

Just look at the brightside (just look at the brightside)
Just look at the club lights (rolling under the club lights)
I gotta look at the brightside (look at the brightside)
I guess she wasn't the one, right
This isn't what love's like
That's for sure

Help me find a way to pass the time (to pass the time)
Everybody telling me life's short, but I wanna die (I wanna die)
Help me find a way to make you mine (make you mine)
Everybody telling me not to, but I'm gonna try
Now I'm getting high again, tonight

I know that you want me, you know that I want you
The memories haunt me, I know that they haunt you too
But it's alright, you'll be fine
Baby, it's alright, you'll be fine
As long as you're mine, take a look at the time
It gets cold at night, when you're alone outside
But it's fine, I'll be fine
Pay me no mind, girl, pay me no mind

Just look at the brightside (just look at the brightside)
Just look at the club lights (rolling under the club lights)
I gotta look at the brightside (look at the brightside)
I guess she wasn't the one, right
This isn't what love's like
That's for sure

Help me find a way to pass the time (to pass the time)
Everybody telling me life's short, but I wanna die (I wanna die)
Help me find a way to make you mine (make you mine)
Everybody telling me not to, but I'm gonna try
Now I'm getting high again, tonight

Just look at the brightside (just look at the brightside)
Just look at the club lights (rolling under the club lights)
Just look at the night life (just look at the night life)
Watching the sun rise by my side
We gotta look at the brightside (just look at the brightside)
Rolling under the club lights (rolling under the club lights)
I gotta look at the brightside (just look at the brightside)
I guess she wasn't the one, right
This isn't what love's like
That's for sure
