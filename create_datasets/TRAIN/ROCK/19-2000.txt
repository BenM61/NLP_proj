It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose

It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose

The world is spinning too fast
And I'm buying Nike shoes
To keep myself tethered
To the days I tried to lose
My mamma said to slow down
You must make your own shoes
And stop dancing to the music
Of Gorillaz in a happy mood
Keepin' my groove on

It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose

Here you go
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine

There's a monkey in the jungle
Watching a vapor trail
Caught up in the conflict
Between his brain and his tail
And if time's elimination
Then we've got nothing to lose
Please repeat the message
Please repeat the message
It's the music that we choose
Keepin' my groove on

It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose
