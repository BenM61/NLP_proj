For each forgotten kiss,
For all the memories,
For all the times a look,
Said all we had to say,

You played your part so well,
A modern Romeo,
You came on Cupids wings,
And then you flew away,

When you touched my face
When you call my name
I'm burned with desire

When you touched my face,
When you call my name,
I'm burned with desire,

When you touched my face,
When you call my name,
I'm burned with desire,

But you left me in the rain

For every sleepless night,
Forever in your arms,
For every hour spent,
Lost in the reverie,

You broke your promises,
No shame and no regrets,
You burned the bridges too,
An endless mystery.

When you touched my face (So beautiful)
When you call my name (My name)
I'm burned with desire

When you touched my face (So beautiful)
When you call my name (My name)
I'm burned with desire

But you left me in the rain
