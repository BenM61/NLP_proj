You're a train ride to no importance
You're in love with hell existence
Money is all that you desire
Why don't you pack it in and retire
It's common nature you can't fool me
I'm just the money that you can't let free
Rainy day genius clouds your mind
Don't you realize the blind lead the blind

You're anti, you're antisocial

Oh mister time will you ever unwind
Or just rebuild a new design
Your claim to fame is low and order
The rich get rich, the poor get poor
You put a price tag on what you see
This one's for you, that's for me
If that's winning I'd rather lose
Why don't you listen to my senseless views

You're anti, you're antisocial
How do you feel ?

You're a train ride to no importance
You're in love with hell existence
Money is all that you desire
Why don't you pack it in and retire
It's common nature you can't fool me
I'm just the money that you can't let free
Rainy days genius clouds your mind
Don't you realize the blind lead the blind

You're anti, you're antisocial

Antisocial,
