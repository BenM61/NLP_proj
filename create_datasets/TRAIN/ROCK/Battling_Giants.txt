Do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do do

I'm small, I'm weak, I'm vulnerable
I know, you think, you see it all
But don't you underestimate me
I know, you think, I'm not the one
A most, unlikely, champion
But don't you underestimate me

'Cause I don't want a kingdom or a crown
'Cause I know there are angels looking down
And I'm battling giants, defiant
I'm fighting to face all of my fears
Yeah I'm fighting Galieth
With my, little David, little David tears
Little David tears

Do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do do

The world around me rises high
I run to every do or die

With all the fortunes, arrows and slings
I know I'm just a man in love
And maybe that is not enough
But I've been a fool to lesser things

I throw my shield and armour to the ground
Faceless things that only bring me down
'Cause I'm battling giants defiant
Yes I'm fighting to face all of my fears
Yeah I'm fighting Galieth
With my little David, little David tears
With my little David, little David tears

'Cause I'm battling giants defiant
Yeah I'm fighting to face all of my fears
Yeah I'm fighting Galieth
With my little David, little David tears
Little David tears
