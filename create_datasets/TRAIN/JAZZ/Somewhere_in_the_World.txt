Like a stranger's smile that lasts for a while
For a moment you feel happy inside
In a world that keeps on changing too fast
When the future always has the last laugh

Maybe we've made mistakes
Maybe we're not the only ones
Maybe it's not too late
To start over

All the shapes and patterns you'll see in your mind
Somewhere in the world
Someone's thinking of you
Somewhere in the world
Someone's thinking of you

Like a rainbow bursting out of the sky
Close your eyes and see your dreams running wild
Colors brighter than the sun all around
Everlasting as this new joy you've found

Maybe we've made mistakes
Maybe we're not the only ones
Maybe it's not too late
To start over

All the shapes and patterns you'll see in your mind
Somewhere in the world
Someone's thinking of you
Somewhere in the world
Someone's thinking of you

Somewhere in the world
Someone's thinking of you


Starting all over again
In a world that keeps on changing much too fast

Maybe we've made mistakes
Maybe we're not the only ones
Maybe it's not too late
To start over

All the shapes and patterns you'll see in your mind
Somewhere in the world
Someone's thinking of you
Somewhere in the world
Someone's thinking of you

Somewhere in the world
Someone's thinking of you
