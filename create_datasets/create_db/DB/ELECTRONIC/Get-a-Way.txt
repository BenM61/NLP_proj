Come with me did you feel so fully irate
Me put under arrest in a new york city
In a dance hall in a dance hall on a dance floor
We do a rum dance man
Raggaman yes it's a raggaman jump
People drinking champagne up
Mum-do-lafasha
Pump it up start to swing about day
While you listen to the music jump up and party.

Ragga this ragga that and a rub-a-dub style
Feeling okay yeah feeling so irate
I'm a white man I'm a white man
Ragga with me and get ready to dance man
Boom-shug-a-lug girl open your mind
I'm a white raggaman maybe one of a kind
I'm a raggaman yes gonna make my day
Open your mind I'm your get away.

Get away get away you're my get away
Get away baby I want to break out
Get away get away you're my get away
Get away get away.

Brl brl bey me feeling irate
Come back again with a sound of karate
On the party I'm the danceman
Flipping around to a rock about style
Drinking champagne up full a fashion
Party people do the wrong dance manner
In the club man on the dance floor
Everybody do the wrong dance manner.

Get away get away you're my get away
Get away baby I want to break out
Get away get away you're my get away
Get away get away.

You're still my get away

Do it do it baby you're my get away.

Get away get away you're my get away
Get away get away you're my get away
