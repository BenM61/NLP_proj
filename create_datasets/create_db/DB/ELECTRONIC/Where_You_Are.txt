Oh oh
Oh oh

There are times
I swear I know you're here
I forget about my fears
Feelin' you my dear

Watchin' over me
My hope sees
What the future will bring
When you wrap your wings
And take me where you are
Where you and I will be together
Once again, we'll be dancin' in the moonlight
Just like we used to do
And you'll be smilin' back at me
Only then will I be free
When I can be, where you are

And I can see your face
Your kiss I still can taste
Not a memory erased

Oh, how I see your star
Shinin' down on me
And I'd do anything
If I could just, be right there where you are

Where you and I will breathe together
Once again we'll be dancin' in the moonlight
Just like we used to do
And you'll be smilin' back at me (you'll be smilin' back at me)

Only then will I be free
Then I will be free, so take me where you are

Now baby there are times when selfishly
I wishin' that you were here with me
So I can wipe the tears from your eyes and make you see

That every night when you are dreamin'
I'm here to guard you from afar
And anytime I feel in love
I'll close my eyes and dream of where you are

Where you are

Where you and I will breathe together
Once again we'll be dancin' in the moonlight
Just like we used to do
And you'll be smilin' back at me (you'll be smilin' back at me)

Only then will I be free
Then I will be free,

Baby I still believe
Oh I gotta believe
I still believe
I will touch you that sweet day

That you take me there
Where you are (where you are)
I still believe
Whoa, I gotta believe
I still believe
I will touch you that sweet day

That you take me there
Where you are, oh where you are!
I still believe
I gotta believe
I still believe
I'll always be waiting here

That sweet day (that sweet day, yeah!)

I still believe , I still believe
