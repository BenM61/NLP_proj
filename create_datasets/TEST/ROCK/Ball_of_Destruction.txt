You wanna try and f*ck with me
And disrespect my family
You wanna judge the way I live
And you don't even know me

You'll never understand our hate
It doesn't matter anyway
Never understand our kind
Try to disrespect what's mine

Your words don't mean a thing to me
Your living in a fantasy
Now we have no more to say
We'll get about it our way

Game has gone far enough
And it's time we put it to an end
We're comin' out with all we got

Time is runnin' out fast
Adn you're the only one to blame
We're comin' out with all we got
You won't forget our name
