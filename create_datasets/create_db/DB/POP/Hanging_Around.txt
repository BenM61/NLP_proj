I used to want the morning,
You and me, just hanging around 
But I can't shake this feeling off, 
Can't shake this dead-weight off of my back 

It's a troubled place we scale 
But we just break it out 
We give too much... although 
... It leaves you cold... oh 

Got no place else to go, 
In a daze just hanging around 
It's a dirt ground we crawl upon, 
I've stared at your face for much too long 

It's a troubled place we scale 
But we just break it out 
Watch us give too much away 
It leaves you cold... oh... 
Cold... oh... cold... 

I used to want the morning, 
You and me, just hanging around 
It's a troubled game we stage 
Where we just wait it out 

Watch us give too much away 
Where we just wait it out 
And the words you meant to say 
And the words i give away 
It leaves you cold... oh... 
Cold... oh... cold...
