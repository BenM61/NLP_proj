This is no final solution
No this is just for today
I'm running from London pollution
Still cold from the rain

These are not perfect conditions
No this is far from ideal
This is a downcast position
At least it is real

It may be silent
But I hear bombs fall
I hear sirens
Down in Whitehall
I see fires around you Paul
But you stand so still
And you look so small
And I'm so tired
Of no help at all

You've been missing for weeks now
You never go far from the site
They won't ask when you show up
They're paid and polite

It may be silent
But I hear bombs fall
I hear sirens
Down in Whitehall
I see fires around you Paul
And you need a drink
Our eyes are glowing
It might be too late
There's no way of knowing

This is no final solution
No this is just for today
I'm running from London pollution
Still cold from the rain
