Today is the day 
That I'm on my way 
I said "Hola, vida!" 
Feel great 
Let the music play 
I'm vibing now 
It's pura vida 

All these places 
All these faces 
Greet me with the smile 
They're like life's love letters 
It gets no better 
I'll be here a while 

I wanna live it 
To the fullest 
Live that pura vida life 
And I know i'll be alright 
I wanna feel it 
I'm gonna do it 
Live that pura vida 
Pura vida life with you 

Today is the day 
That I'm on my way 
I said "Hola, vida!" 
Feel great 
Let the music play 
I'm vibing now 
It's pura vida 

All these places 
All these faces 
Greet me with the smile 
They're like life's love letters 
It gets no better 
I'll be here a while 

Today is the day 
That I'm on my way 
I said "Hola, vida!" 
Feel great 
Let the music play 
I'm vibing now 
It's pura vida 

Today is the day 
That I'm on my way 
I said "Hola, vida!" 
Feel great 
Let the music play 
I'm vibing now 
It's pura vida
