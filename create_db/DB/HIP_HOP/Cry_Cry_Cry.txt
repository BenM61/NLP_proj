You know, you know, you know (one, two, three, go!)
Bang bang
Now you're making me ghost
When my gun barrel smokes
Poor thing jumped out of her clothes
Her body dropped undressing her
So, another girl with a broken heart
The world just doesn't need (bang)
Not one more lonely thought
Singing the sad song
I'm begging please, see (see, see)
I do anything

Woi woi woi

Never wanna see my girl
Cry cry cry
No way, no way
Woi woi woi

Never wanna see a girl
Cry cry cry

Again I say
Woi woi woi

I never wanna see my girl
Cry cry cry again
I say woi woi woi

Rather I would wanna die
Rather I would wanna die

Bang bang
He was putting her down
Ice cold like America (down)
Poor thing was enjoying the ride
She thought she was on a marry-go-round
Bad boys move in silence, girl
The night is still with no soul around (yeah)
So smooth, no violence now
Hush don't make a sound
(One, two, three, four!) Woi woi woi

Never wanna see my girl
Cry cry cry
No way, no way
Woi woi woi

Never wanna see a girl
Cry cry cry
Again I say
Woi woi woi

Never wanna see my girl
Cry cry cry again
I say woi woi woi

Rather I would wanna die
Rather I would wanna die
Jump!

(One, two, three, go!) Woi woi woi

Never wanna see my girl
Cry cry cry
No way, no way
Woi woi woi

Never wanna see a girl

Never wanna see my girl
Cry cry cry again
No, I say woi woi woi

Rather I would wanna die
