If I don't pick up the phone like I used to (for you)
Don't you take it personal
If I don't do all the things that I used to do (to you)
I ain't mad at you
If you get to feeling stressed up in your chest
Thinking that you about to lose
(Baby its true)
And if you losing out on sleep
On worrying about me
This how it be

If you don't know
Now you know you're gonna miss (my love)
And I ain't stressing bout a dog gone thing
'Cause I was true when I gave you (my love)
If you search you will never find another love like (my love)
You're gonna miss me
I ain't got time while you sit around and play with my (my love)

If you think I caught a feeling
When I heard about that other chick (no)
I already knew about it
I just needed time
Just to clear my mind
And ask myself
(why I didn't handle him)
If you would've taken care of home
Instead of leaving me alone
(I) still would be right there with you
Taking care of you
Instead of loving you
Like I used to do

If you don't know
Now you know you're gonna miss (my love)
And I ain't stressing bout a dog gone thing
'Cause I was true when I gave you (my love)
If you search you will never find another love like (my love)
You're gonna miss me
I ain't got time while you sit around and play with my (my love)

There once was a time
I blamed myself for what was wrong
(I can see so clearly now because you are gone)
That's how I spent all my time when you weren't home
(Playin' around with them raggedy heffers)
There'll be no more stressing
No more crying no more trying
I would rather be alone
(Id rather be all by myself yeah)
'Cause this valuable heart of mine
Was yours until I realized finally opened my eyes

You see ladies
I know I know better
What was I thinking?
He gon' miss me when I'm gone

If you don't know
Now you know you're gonna miss (my love)
And I ain't stressing bout a dog gone thing
'Cause I was true when I gave you (my love)
If you search you will never find another love like (my love)
You're gonna miss me
I ain't got time while you sit around and play with my (my love)
