Up from the ashes, out of the flames                       
Keeps gettin' stronger, like a slow rollin' train                       
Watch it run                       
Oh, why do the good die young                       
Burnin' like a shootin' star                       
Born with a broken heart                       
Off in the distance, it was callin' my name                       
So I took me a ride, on that slow rollin' train                       
It still runs                       
But it seems that the good die young                       
Playin' on that sad guitar                       
Born with a broken heart                       
Burnin' like a shootin' star                       
Born with a broken heart                       
Seems it was over, before it begun                       
Killed by a bullet, from a six-string gun                       
Bang a drum                       
Oh, why do the good die young                       
Ridin' in a long black car                       
Born with a broken heart                       
Playin' on that sad guitar                       
Born with a broken heart                       
Burnin' like a shootin' star                       
Born with a broken heart
