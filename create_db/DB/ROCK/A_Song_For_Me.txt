I was waiting, I was singing
I was standing patiently
Who would wait this long for me
Who's gonna sing a song for me

I was smiling, I was walking
Open mind to open miles
Who will crack me a crooked smile
Who'll still climb my crooked stiles

I was crying, I was stumbling
Over broken glass laid tracks
Following ancient portrait maps
Who could tell me, who could tell the paths from cracks

I was talking, I was shouting
Listen please don't turn away
Who turns deaf to what I say
Who will paint my portrait grey

I was crying, I was stumbling
Over broken glass laid tracks
Following ancient portrait maps
Who could tell me, who could tell the paths from cracks

I was waiting, I was singing
I was standing patiently
Who would wait this long for me
Who's gonna sing a song for me
