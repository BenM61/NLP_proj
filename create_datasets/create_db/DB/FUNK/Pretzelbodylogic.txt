Pretzelbodylogic yeah, it's so much fun!
Dreaming of each other on each other's tongue
Tastes a bitter sweet undone
Now we both too sleepy to get the gun

Woo!

Oh!

(Wake up)

Woo!

Hear the plane humming back on the run
One I would sleep between 'em better than none
Promoter tried to rob 'em we said "Go 'head son!"
Because we're both too sleepy to get the gun

Pretzelbodylogic yeah, it's so much fun!
Dreaming of each other on each other's tongue
Tastes a bitter sweet undone
Now we both too sleepy to get the gun

Bank's on a holiday, credit's overrun
Somebody else's problem to tie for another one
Pull these shades one me black out the Sun
I need a little more rest, then we'll do what needs to be done!

Pretzelbodylogic yeah, it's so much fun!
Dreaming of each other on each other's tongue
Tastes a bitter sweet undone
Now we both too sleepy to get the gun

Woo!

Limo on tarmack ready to ride
Cutie-Pie driver said "Get inside!"
Another limousine about to get alone
Put your seat back now, it's one (One!) two (Two!)
Three for the road! (Three for the road!)

Pretzelbodylogic yeah, it's so much fun!
Dreaming of each other on each other's tongue
Tastes a bitter sweet undone
Now we both too sleepy to get the gun

Pretzelbodylogic yeah, it's so much fun!
Dreaming of each other on each other's tongue
Tastes a bitter sweet undone
Now we both too sleepy to get the gun

Woo!
