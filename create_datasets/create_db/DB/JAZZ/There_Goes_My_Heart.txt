There goes my heart, there goes the one I love
There goes the girl I wasn't worthy of
There goes my happiness, it couldn't be
There goes somebody else in place of me

Goodbye romance, it couldn't last somehow
I had my chance but it's all over now
I never thought that she could pass me by
There goes my heart and here am I

I never thought that she could pass me by
There goes my heart and here am I
