In my mind
I've got it all figured out
But the head
Does not always rule the heart
And I try to place him
Out of body and soul
Just when I thought Id made it
His images start taking their toll
On me
I feel his memory haunting me
Time and Again
I feel weak because

[Chorus]
Every time I see your picture I cry
And I learn to get over you
One more time because
Every time I see your picture I cry
Oh I cry

There you rest inside the walls
Of a flame
Hurts so bad
I can almost feel your eyes
Calling out my name and so
Out of body and soul
You're everywhere I go
Illusion or reality I don't know
I feel your memory haunting me
Time and again
I feel weak because

[Chorus]
