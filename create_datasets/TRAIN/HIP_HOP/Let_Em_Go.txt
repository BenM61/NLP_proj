Well, here's a lil' story that we like to tell
About two bad brothas that you know so well
With a pimp gain shoe game know we up on that
Latin chicks, white chicks and you know we love them black

Night man, nightmare I can hit it right

Black rims 23's shorty we can take a ride
(Take a ride)
We get it crunk from wall to wall
(Wall to wall)
If your man is actin' up shorty gimme a call

Come with me
(You can come with me)
To my lavish suite
(Come lay with a G)
And lay close with me
(It's between you and me)

I'm not a playa I just crush a lot
(Crush a lot)
I keep them chicks impressed by the whips I got
You seem to bitch a lot 'cause your man ain't never there
So if you're tryna get away, I can meet you there

And baby girl, if we kick it you gon' love that
(Love that)
If you a freak lemme know 'cause I can love that
(Love that)
You like the fact that I be rhymin' on tracks
And the ice on the wrist will keep 'em blinded till the fact

'Cause I've always said what he can't see won't hurt
I'm on the side, I can see it so it's gon' work
I'm not the type to be hatin' but you need to let him
(Go)
Let's go

Come with me

(Come lay with a G)
And lay close with me

Tryna get paid gotta stay on my grind
But it's girls I could self that stay on my mind

You need to listen when I tell you to let him go
