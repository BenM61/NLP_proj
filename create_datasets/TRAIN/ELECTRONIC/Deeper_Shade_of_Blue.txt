If only you read my mind  You'd see I was hurt inside  A thousand times I've told myself it's over (it's over)  But the story has just begun  And darling whats done is done  It's time to change and leave the past behind    Why should we know all the answers  Or how the story ends (so baby)    Let's take a chance on a happy ending  (Let's) turn the page and stop pretending  The past can stop a heart from mending  It's time to let go 'cos baby you know   Some things are better best forgotten    And baby we can't pretend   In time the scars will mend  Please believe me theres a chance  let's take it (let's take it)  And maybe at last we'll find  That love should be true not blind  You can't decieve a heart that's open wide    (And) even now it's not to late  To change the story's end (so baby)    Let's take a chance on a happy ending  (Let's) turn the page and stop pretending  The past can stop a heart from mending  It's time to let go 'cos baby you know   Some things are better best forgotten    The story has just begun   Darlin' what's done is done  It's time to leave the past behind
