And we frittered the time that we had on our hands
And we measured the time that elapsed
And we stumbled around like madmen unbound
And I said, "Look out boys, these are traps"

And I was just a stranger then
Yes, I was just a stranger then
And I was just a stranger then

And we followed a path till we slipped up and laughed
And I lived half a life in that state
And we got our release in everything but peace
And peace of a record second rate

And I was just a stranger then
And I was just a stranger then
Yes, I was just a stranger then
Like a stranger, always strangest at home

Well, I like what you do
But you will never break through
You can try if you want
But you'll fail

And I was just a stranger then
Yes, I was just a stranger then
And I was just a stranger then
Like a stranger, always strangest at home
