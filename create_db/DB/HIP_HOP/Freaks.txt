(Freak, some gyal ah freak ah di week)

Lights up the fire, you know we get higher
Rolling up loud, real niggas moving quiet
Like it then I buy it, you donkeys on a diet
Bringing all my jewels, how you know I start a riot
Riding with the bliquor, messing up her make up
You blowing up her phone, she ain't trying to pick up
Drinking out the bottle, I'm leaning with a model
I throw a hundred racks up, you think I hit the lotto
Riding with the wolves, I ain't talkin Minnesota
Shorty coming over, go and bend it over
Let me plank on it, put a drink on it
Heard you a freak, put my name on it (Montana)

(Freak, some gyal ah freak ah di week)

This girl tell me, say she horny
She want to give it to me out the door
This girl f*ck me like she know me
She backed it up then she tipped on her toes

He said he met this little girl by the name of Onika
Way my body shape, all the boys wanna freak her
Brag and I boast, they be doin' the most
If I look at his friend, he'll be grippin' the toaster
So I took him to the crib to kill him with it
Put my legs behind my head, I hit the ceiling with it
When I put it in his mouth I couldn't believe it
He looked me in my eyes and said he wanna breed it
Passa Passa
You ain't got no wins in mi casa
Big fat pussy, Mufasa
Hit up Green Acres, hit up Queens Plaza
Some of them say them gully, some of them say them gaza.

(Freak, some gyal ah freak ah di week)

This girl tell me, say she horny
She want to give it to me out the door
This girl f*ck me like she know me
She backed it up then she tipped on her toes

Where my bad bitches at?
Where my bad bitches at?
Pretty gang make noise
Pretty gang make noise
Pretty gang act the f*ck, act the-act the f*ck up

Where my bad bitches at?
Where my bad bitches at?
Rude girls make noise
Rude girls make noise
Rude girl act the fucked up, act, act the f*ck up
(Act the f*ck up, act, act the f*ck up)

(Freak, some gyal ah freak ah di week)

This girl tell me, say she horny
She want to give it to me out the door
This girl f*ck me like she know me
She backed it up then she tipped on her toes

I don't even say my name no more, play nigga
I don't even say playboy, I say play nigga
And what the f*ck you talkin' 'bout with the fake figures
I come through like, I mean no Nicki
I came through South side nigga Queen bitch
And everybody know, you on my dick
Montana! (haan)
