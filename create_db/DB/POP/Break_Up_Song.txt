By the grace, of your lips
I have long searched, happiness
And the love, in our hearts
Shone away, through the dark
But lately, lately, lately, lately, I
Have felt an overwhelming need to cry
And maybe, maybe, maybe we can try
To make it right, oh to make it right

This is our break up song, but
Can't we just get along for the night
Not a fight, one less goodbye
But just a moment, let me hold back
Baby hold back, all the things we haven't said
Make love like we just met

By the way
Let you kiss, I know it's over, yeah all of this
And the one world, that we knew
Has broken, in two
'Cause lately, lately, lately, lately, I
Have felt the good of change I get tonight
And baby, baby, baby, if we try
We make it right, yeah we make it right

This is our break up song, but
Can't we just get along for the night
Not a fight, one less, goodbye
But just a moment, let me hold back
Baby hold back, all the things we haven't said
Make love like we just met

Oh, I'm gonna miss the way you held me in the morning
I'm gonna miss the future that we planned
The way we fought, the way we kissed
The heat inside, the tenderness
Love was our religion ooh

This is our break up song, but
Can't we just get along for the night
In spite, of the hurt we hide
For old times sake
Won't you just take me by the waist
And hold me underneath the sheets
Make love like our first week

This is our break up song, but (a break up song)
Can't we just get along for the night (get along)
Not a fight, one less, goodbye (goodbye)
But just a moment, let me hold back
Baby hold back, all the things we haven't said
Make love like we just met (we just met)
