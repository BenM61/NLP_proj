Ain't nuttin like a homey when you need support
And especially, when your pockets is short
Homeboy I need a C-note, my funds is lack
Here you go buddy, no hurry to pay it back
You know what I mean? That's a true friend
And I would be there with my homey 'til the day it end
Cause I don't really give a f*ck, my rhyme...
Can I say that man? Can I use that verse? Okay I won't
I don't really give a f*ck I got my homeboy back
In case a sucker's playing king, he might get jacked
And I'll always remember what my brother told me
