Step outside
That comfort zone
Wanna take you
To a place you've never known

At the end of the line
Oh yeah
Don't you worry bout falling
Falling
Won't you play this game with me

I dreamed there will always be
Someone that never leaves me
Hear in this darkness I need to feel free
From this colourless world
Free from this colourless world

Step into
This solitude
Nothings quiet
What it seems from the start

At the end of the line
Oh yeah
Don't you worry bout falling
Falling
Won't you play this game with me

I dreamed there will always be
Someone that never leaves me
Hear in this darkness I need to feel free
From this colourless world
Free from this colourless world
