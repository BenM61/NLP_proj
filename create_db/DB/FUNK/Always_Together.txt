Just you, just me, always together
I made up my mind years ago
When I first gazed upon you I'd never let you go
And it's amazing baby 

How we loved each other so 
And we'll always be (always be)
Always together

We'll have our problems
But we'll face them with pride
Our love is protection
And we don't have to hide

And a thousand nights I'll kiss away 
(The happy tears you cry)
And we'll always be (always be)
Always together

Just you, just me
Always, always, always, 
Always, always, always, 
When the years have turned 

Your hair to silver
And the days of our youth 
Have left us so very far behind
Golden, golden memories

Will keep in our minds
And we'll always be (always be)
Always together
Just you, just me
Always, always, always... etc.
