all of my
all my adult life
I've tried to avoid
being your wife
so after all
the trickery and sex
all I've ever really wanted
was to be a princess

you've got me fit like a cliche
you've got me fit like a cliche
you've got me fit like a cliche
how do you make a girl say what she said she'd never say
you've got me fit like a cliche you've got me fit like a cliche from the sunrise to the sunset I'm a cliche

dont let him get your heart
meet him at the end
right before it starts
the devil
in his most attractive guise
when everything you ever really need is betwixed his thighs

wherever you go
whatever you do
he's coming for you

you've got me fit like a cliche
you've got me fit like a cliche
you've got me fit like a cliche
how do you make a girl say what she said she'd never say
you've got me fit like a cliche you've got me fit like a cliche from the sunrise to the sunset I'm a cliche
