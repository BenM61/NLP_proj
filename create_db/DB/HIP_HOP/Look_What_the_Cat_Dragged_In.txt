Look what the cat dragged in
Look what the cat dragged in
Look what the cat dragged in
Look what the cat dragged

Cream of the crop shit
I got chicks all schemin' to hop giggs
They feelin ma hot shit
BP wanna' lean in ma cockpit (YESS)
Feelin ma chopstick
Diabetes, feelin the chocolate (UMMM)
Beatin it off shit
Have a three-some, peas in a pod shit (AHH)

I'm a bait artist
I done it bare back I take chances
Straight naasty I ain't glaancin
I'm a breast man but I rate arses
Late parties, but I aint daancin
courvoisier ant fillin up eight glaases
Vip shit, eight paases
Suttin freaky for me to take part in

[Chorus]
Look at the swag dats himm
Hollowman who gets the mad stacks in
Look at his, Kicks and the hats matchinn (that's RIGHT)
Look what the cat dragged in
This ain't your average bling
Look at him
This ain't an average thingg
Look what the cat dragged (CAT DRAGGED)
Push up your black flag (BLACK FLAG)

Buck came round
Fest juss rang, Nuts came down
Ma little slut playground
I was guilty but I'ma boss case now
I wannt a touch base now
I want my cup cake round
Look round at Nuts face smile
I make the sluts go waaaa!
Told the mandemm to not argue
Nuts toilet, Buck bathroom
Hollowmans nice top claas room
Fest stil ringin sayin he might pass through
My little light caastle
Cos hollowmans packagin' the right parcel
That Slim Shady like Marshall
His friends still comin' with a nice car full

[Chorus]
Look at the swag dats himm
Hollowman who gets the mad stacks in
Look at his, Kicks and the hats matchinn (that's RIGHT)
Look what the cat dragged in
This aint your average bling
Look at him
This aint an average thingg
Look what the cat dragged (CAT DRAGGED)
Push up your black flag (BLACK FLAG)
