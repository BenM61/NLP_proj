(Oh what am I gonna do)

I'm so afraid of losing you can't sleep at night since we're through
My world would end if I lose you oh what am I gonna do

In all my dreams I see your smile though it just last a little while
For that same smile he dreams up too oh what am I gonna do

I've seen you out with him though you've not seen me
You looked into his eyes and said words you said to me
Each time he holds you close something happens to me
I wish that you were in my arms just saying you love me

Endless dreams lonely nights empty arms that long to hold you tight
Mem'ries of a love untrue oh what am I gonna do
Oh what am I gonna do
