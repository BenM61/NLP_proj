I woke up again last night,
You smell of him, do we need to call the doctor
I don't know where you've been
Was it worth it, was it worth it

Sit tight, this might
Be the first time that I caught you out
You got to think twice, this might,
Be the last time that I call you by your name

I know your lying to me,
Cause your palms start to sweat
And your knees are getting heavy

Eyes closed,
Your lying to me when your heart starts to race,
And your feet are getting ready

Your fumbling for the phone on the wall
There's nobody left to call
Cause there's no one out there
It's hard to believe that no one can see the writing on the wall

I woke up again last night. Let the party begin
And we'll live happily ever after
I'm making you wait outside
Cause I'm worth it yeah I'm worth it

Dressed to impress now
Looking your best
And you wanna get away from me
But you're obsessed with the sex girl
Should I confess that you never got the best from me

I know your lying to me,
Cause your palms start to sweat
And your knees are getting heavy

Eyes closed,
Your lying to me when your heart starts to race,
And your feet are getting ready
Your fumbling for the phone on the wall
There's nobody left to call
There's no one out there
It's hard to believe that no one can see the writing on the wall

Don't stop now you're ready to go
We're at the best part of the show
Turn the lights out it's over.
The nights just about to explode

I know your lying to me,
Cause your palms start to sweat
And your knees are getting heavy

Eyes closed,
Your lying to me when your heart starts to race,
And your feet are getting ready

Your fumbling for the phone on the wall
There's nobody left to call
There's no one out there
It's hard to believe that no one can see the writing on the wall

Don't stop now don't stop now
Turn the lights out it's over.
The nights just about to explode
