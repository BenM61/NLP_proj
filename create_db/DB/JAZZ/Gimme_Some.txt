Loving is the thing I crave.
For your love, I'd be your slave.
Gimme some.
I can't stand it no longer.
Gimme some.
Don't be bashful, come over here;
Whisper some sweet words in my ear.
Gimme some.
Gimme some.
I can't wait eight days.
Gimme some.
Come on over here and fill my cup.
Love me so hard I can't stand up.
Gimme some.
Gimme some.
Don't you know I love you?
Gimme some.
Just a closer walk would be
Doo, wah, diddy, daddy, one, two, three.
Gimme some.
Gimme some.
You know I have to have it.
Gimme some.
I know that you want to do what's right;
Just come on and love me all night,
And gimme some.
I tell ya, I want some.
I can't stand it no longer.
Gimme some.
I like cornbread nice and yellow,
So I want you to be my fellow.
Gimme some.
Gimme some.
Don't you know I love you?
Gimme some.
One of these mornings, just about dawn,
You'll be working on my lawn.
Gimme some.
Gimme some.
I can't stand it no longer.
Gimme some.
I declare to my main,
You gonna drive me stone insane.
Gimme some.
Gimme some.
I can't wait eight days.
Gimme some.
I like fried chicken, you know it's true,
But there's no sweeter meat in the world than you.
I want some day to be your wife,
So you can thrill me the rest of your life.
So stop stalling,
Finish your drink, and let's get falling.
Gimme some.
Gimme some.
I can't stand it no longer.
Why don't you gimme some?
