You may call me a rollin' stone, I'm a free born man and I stand alone
I come a-lookin' for a little satisfaction
I don't drive no Cadillac, What I've got's hangin' on my back
I do believe in a physical attraction
I can warm your coldest nights, I'll make everything alright

Ooooh rock me baby, make me feel that beat
I said ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh rock me baby right down to my feet
I said ah-ah-ah-ah rock me baby, hold me oh so tight
I said woooh rock me baby, rock me through the night
Hey you better hold me while you can
Or you're gonna lose your midnight man
Rock me, rock-n-roll me, yeah

I was twelve when I left home, Ever since I've been-a on my own
I come a lookin' for a little recreation
Guess I'll never settle down, It's always been just-a one more town
While I've looked from coast to coast across the nation
I can't promise I'll be true, But I'll see what I can do

Ooooh rock me baby, let me feel that beat
I said ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh rock me baby right down to my feet
I said ah-ah-ah-ah rock me baby, hold me oh so tight
I said wooh-ooh-ooh-ooh rock me baby, rock me through the night
Hey you better hold me while you can
Or you're gonna lose your midnight man
Rock me, rock-n-roll me baby

Come on and rock me, come here and shock me
Get down woman, mmmm, come on and squeeze me
Oooh you sure do please me, alright woman
Oh rock me, rock me, hold me, right the beat
I said ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh baby right down to my feet
I said ro-o-o-o-rock me baby, hold me oh so tight
I said wooh-ooh-ooh-ooh rock me baby, rock me through the night
Hey you better hold me while you can
Or you're gonna lose your midnight man
Rock me, rock'n'roll me woman
