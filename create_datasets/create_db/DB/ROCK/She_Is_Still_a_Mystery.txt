Remember hallways, you're waiting always
To see behind the door
You never seen her, you're gonna meet her
The first time's so unsure

She smiles your way through a window
You smile right back, she runs away
You wish little girls'd sit still just a little bit longer,
Longer

And she's still a mystery to me
I thought I'd grow up gracefully
I'd understand my woman thoroughly
But the more I see (but the more I see)
The more I see there is to see,
There is to see
And she's still a mystery to me (she's still a mystery to me)
She's still a mystery to me

I used to wonder when in thunder understandin's done
But now I'm graspin' that understandin' is only part of love

She'll smile your way through a window
You'll smile right back, she'll run away
You wish little girls'd sit still just a little bit longer,
Longer

And she's still a mystery to me
I thought I'd grow up gracefully
I'd understand her thoroughly
But she's a mystery to me
But she's a mystery to me
(But she's a mystery to me)
(But she's a mystery to me)
And she's still a mystery to me (she's a mystery to me)
(She's a mystery to me)
She's still a mystery to me (she's a mystery to me)
(She's a mystery to me)
She is still a mystery to me, mm-hmm (she's a mystery to me)
(She's a mystery to me)
(She's a mystery to me)
