There's a light on
I see it flashing like a white alarm
Oh, you've got a look in your eyes
You don't think you're satisfied
Ain't nothing I did wrong

You step a little closer
Yeah, you can whisper it between my ears
You know those words ignite a spark
A flame within the dark
You're feeling dangerous
Feeling dangerous
Oh, don't make me fight fire with fire
Fire with fire
You (you) just need a little water
Need a little water

Yeah, there's a light on
I see it flashing like a white alarm
Oh, yeah, you've got a look in your eyes
You don't think you're satisfied
Ain't nothing I did wrong
Nothing, nothing I did wrong

Oh, don't make me fight fire with fire
Fire with fire
You (you) just need a little water
Need a little water
Oh, don't make me fight fire with fire
Fire with fire (don't make me)
You (you) just need a little water
Need a little water

Oh, don't make me fight fire with fire
Fire with fire (don't make me)
You (you) just need a little water
Need a little water

Oh, don't make me fight fire with fire
Fire with fire (don't make me)
You (you) just need a little water
Need a little water
