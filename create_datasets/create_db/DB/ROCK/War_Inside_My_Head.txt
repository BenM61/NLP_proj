War inside my head
War inside my head
War inside my head
War inside my head

War inside my head ain't a pretty sight
But I don't want no sympathy
It's happened a thousand times before
It's just a harsh reality

War inside my head can you sense it
War inside my head can you see it
War inside my head can you feel it
War inside my head

Can you hear the pain
Can you see the pain
Can you sense the pain
Can you feel the pain
Can you help the pain
Can you fix the pain
Can you taste the pain
Can you hear the war inside my head

The only thing real is the way I feel
And that's the pain that's deep inside
That battle from within is gonna begin
And there ain't nowhere to hide

War inside my head can you sense it
War inside my head can you see it
War inside my head can you feel it
War inside my head

War inside my head every night and day
I never get no piece of mind
It ought to be a sin, I just can't win
And pure hell is all I find

War inside my head can you sense it
War inside my head can you see it
War inside my head can you feel it
War inside my head
