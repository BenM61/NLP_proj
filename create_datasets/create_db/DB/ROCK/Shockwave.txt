I'm like a shock wave coming through your door!
I'm like a bullet at the speed of light!
I go around taking peoples lives!
While you set around saying lies.
When I'm around you will feel the pain.
And when I'm done you will be no more.
Your life is through now mine begins.
My day's of agony are now gone!

I'm shock wave and I don't need anyone!
I'll follow the wave till the day I die!
I'm a shock wave and I'll take your fucking life!
Don't mess with me I'm a shock wave ready to kill!

I am the one who feeds off your life.
I'll be right there when your ready to die!

I am a killer but there all scared.
When I rise no time is spared!

I'm shock wave and I don't need anyone!
I'll follow the wave till the day I die!
I'm a shock wave and I'll take your fucking life!
Don't mess with me I'm a shock wave ready to kill!

Shock wave!

I'm shock wave and I don't need anyone!
I'll follow the wave till the day I die!
I'm a shock wave and I'll take your fucking life!
Don't mess with me I'm a shock wave ready to kill!

I'm shock wave and I don't need anyone!
I'll follow the wave till the day I die!
I'm a shock wave and I'll take your fucking life!
Don't mess with me I'm a shock wave ready to kill!
