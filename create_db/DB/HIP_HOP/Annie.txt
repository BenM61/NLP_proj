Annie no, no, no, I gotta go, go, go
Stack that dough, dough, dough on the low, low, low
Annie no, no, no, I gotta go, go, go
Stack that dough, dough, dough on the low, low, low

Ohh Annie ohh Annie ohh Annie
You are not alone no I can't leave you alone
Ohh Annie ohh Annie ohh Annie
You are not alone no I can't leave you alone

I leave that go-go-gold
Two chains on fro-fro-froze
Roll up when I smo-smo-smoke
She was bad but bro bro-broke (ooh)
I want all the drugs in the world
To cure my sickness for some girl
Pain and pills all in my cup
We make love and then we uhh
I got keys inside my whip
Pasta pasta she's my bitch
Me write song and then we dip
All these hoes they played my chips
Jesus called he said what's up?
(Oh there Annie) What the f*ck?
Rainbow dog and smokey flames
All y'all black with whitest names
Tread my head my neck it ache
(Oh there Annie) Cast that fame
(Love you granny) We done came
(In Miami) Surfin' my wave
Man I love music cracking my mucus
Flowing like Cuba kill me I'm human
Teacher turned student, f*ck am I doing
F*ck is my momma Annie I'm choosing
She done raised Alex he was that savage
She was that monster raised up in malice
All in my habit split my wing backwards
Disappear magic abracadabra
I coulda been a felon on broadway
He say she say all in the wrong way
(Oh there Annie) Still playing doomsday
(Oh there granny) Trapping out the hallway

Ohh Annie ohh Annie ohh Annie
You are not alone, no I can't leave you alone
Ohh Annie ohh Annie ohh Annie
You are not alone no, I can't leave you alone

Little black boy like Mike
Magic in my hands all day and all night
Running through stop signs, running through life
Might kill me a nigga might f*ck tonight
A (?) of weed is all I need
The (?) skeet skeet skeet
The picket fence, the corner shop
The after school, the girls we got
Way way back in the nosebleed section
I'm so young so dumb so reckless
I got bars like antidepressant
He xanned off but your girl stay texting
All this damn gold on my neck, I'm flexing
Two chains, two names y'all keep guessing
High five and a hip hip hooray
Got boys scout word all this shit that I say
I been sucked on by you (what the blackness say)
I was bulletproof, I was payed today
Ayyy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

Ohh Annie ohh Annie ohh Annie
You are not alone no I can't leave you alone
Ohh Annie ohh Annie ohh Annie
You are not alone no I can't leave you alone

I need that go-go-gold
Two chains on fro-fro-froze
Roll up when I smo-smo-smoke
She was bad but bro-bro-broke
