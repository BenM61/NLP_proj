You've got the sweet innocent smile
Eyes to idolize
Shivers down my spine
Take my breath away
I want to thank you for the love you gave
And I want to thank you for the heart you saved

Thank you
Thank you for the love
I want to thank you for the hearts and flowers

People let me say
Mm this is nice
I know you think I'm foolish
And I'm making a mistake but
To me this is perfect
I want to

Thank you
Thank you for the love
I can't believe it's really happening to me

Thank you
Thank you for the love
I want to thank you for the hearts and flowers
Oh yea

I want to thank you for our rainy days
And I want to thank you for the love you gave
And I want to thank you for the month of May
'Cause that's when you came and took my tears away
And I want to thank you
Want to thank you

Want to thank you for our rainy days
And I want to thank you for the love you gave
And I want to thank you for the month of May
'Cos that's when you came and stole my heart away

And I want to thank you
Want to thank you

Thank you for the love
I want to thank you for the hearts and flowers
Oh yea
