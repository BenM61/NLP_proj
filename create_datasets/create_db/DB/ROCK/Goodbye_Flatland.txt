Think it's time I went on my way
And say goodbye to Flatland today
What I'm saying, reaching out to the sky
It's not anything that you don't know why
Saying goodbye to Flatland

I love you more each day
You can explain away the days
'Cause it's already happening
The view is changed

No more are we centered
No more are we holding on to save it all
All it takes to say goodbye to Flatland

And it's not anything
Babe that you don't know why, don't know why
Not anything, it's not anything
Not anything, not anything
