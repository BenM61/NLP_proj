Now we kiss good-bye
you'll be off to war, the battle's on 
I don't wanna cry as I stand 
And watch your ship sail on 
Now when you're out to sea
And the sky is dark and water surrounds you 
And your heart just won't be 'cause you feel 
As if our loneliness will drive you

Forget me not, boy 
Let my love comfort you 
Comfort you and see you through 
Forget me not, boy 
Lock my memory in your heart 
And we'll never be apart

Remember Old Joe's, 
Our favorite song, our table for two
Well, heaven knows, these little things 
I'll share with no one but you 
Wherever you are, no land 
And sea and time will divide us 
No matter how far
Back to each other's arms our love's gonna guide us

Forget me not, boy 
Write a letter every day 
Don't throw my picture away 
Forget me not, boy 
Let my love within you burn 
I'll be here when you return

Each night I will pray for peace on earth, goodwill to all men 
And my little heart will say these tender words time and time again:

Forget me not, boy 
Let my love within you burn 
I'll be here when you return 
Forget me not, boy 
Lock my memory in your heart 
And we'll never be apart 
Forget me not, boy
