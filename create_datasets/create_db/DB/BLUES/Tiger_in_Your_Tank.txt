I put a tiger in your tank
I put a tiger in your tank
I put a tiger in your tank

I put a tiger in your tank
I put a tiger in your tank
I put a tiger in your tank

I know you love me baby, you told me last night
You make me feel like I'm dissatisfied

I put a tiger in your tank
I put a tiger in your tank
I put a tiger in your tank
I put a tiger in your tank

I love the way you look
Love your little car
But you're darned so slow can't go very far
I don't care what the people think
I'm gonna put a tiger in your tank

I can raise your hood
I can clean your coil
Check your transmission 
Then give you the oil
I don't care what the people think
I got to put a tiger in your tank

Your motor's popin' needs a listen to
One thing I look for for you to do

You give it a push and if the car don't crank
You know you need a tiger in your tank

I put a tiger in your tank
I put a tiger in your tank
I put a tiger in your tank
I put a tiger in your tank
I don't care what people think
I put a tiger in your tank

I put a tiger in your tank
I put a tiger in your tank
I put a tiger in your tank
I don't care what the people say
I put a tiger in your tank
