When the world outside
Has got me kinda stressen
I only live to be next to
Through the madness
You remain my greatest pleasure
No one but God
Deserves such love
And If I had
One night on this earth to spend
I'll spend it loving you
And out of all I've experienced
Nothing comes close to this
You're all I need

Sensitive lover
How beautiful you are
You satisfy my every need
Sensitive lover
You went and raised the bar
From your head to your feet
Girl you so complete
So complete

All the good times
And the bad times
You remained the same
That's why
I'm gonna keep on loving you
Through the joy and pain
I've had 9's and 10's
But I couldn't find
All the beauty that's in you

Sensitive lover
How beautiful you are
You satisfy my every need
Sensitive lover
You went and raised the bar
From your head to your feet
Girl you so complete
So complete

Sensitive lover
How beautiful you are
You satisfy my every need
Sensitive lover
You went and raised the bar
From your head to your feet
Girl you so complete
So complete
