I will never take back
The words that I said then
I will always come back to you

Even in the meantime
I will always stand by
A mirror on the shelf

Call you in the nighttime
Call you in the daytime
Can't fess up to you

'Cause I hope
We will never have to take back
What we said in the night
I hope that I will always have
All eyes on you
Know that I will take what I can
When you are there standing by
Soft, spoken in the dead of night
All eyes on you

I will never take back
The words that I said then
I always knew I'd come back to you

Even in the meantime
I will always stand by
A mirror on the shelf

'Cause I hope
We will never have to take back
What we said in the night
I hope that I will always have
All eyes on you
Know that I will take what I can
When you are there standing by
Soft, spoken in the dead of night
All eyes on you

I hope
We will never have to take back
What we said in the night
I hope that I will always have
All eyes on you
Know that I will take what I can
When you are there standing by
Soft, spoken in the dead of night
All eyes on you

I hope
We will never have to take back
What we said in the night
I hope that I will always have
All eyes on you
Know that I will take what I can
When you are there standing by
Soft, spoken in the dead of night
All eyes on you

I hope
We will never have to take back
What we said in the night
I hope that I will always have
All eyes on you
Know that I will take what I can
When you are there standing by
Soft, spoken in the dead of night
All eyes on you

All eyes on you
All eyes on you
