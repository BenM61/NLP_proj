--Andrea:
Guarda fuori e gia mattina
Questo e un giorno che ricorderai
Alzati in fretta e vai
C'e chi crede in te
Non ti arrendere
 
--Marco:
Luister naar de zon    
Zij roept je naam      
Dit is jouw moment     
Dus ga nu maar staan   
En wees niet bang voor het licht 
Dat je voelt op je gezicht 
â€˜t is echt bedoeld voor jou   

Listen to the sun
She calls out your name
This is your moment
So (do) stand up
And don't be afraid of the light
That you feel upon your face
It is really meant for you
 
--Andrea: 
Like stars across the sky
E per avvincere tu dovrai vincere
Together:
We were born to shine
All of us here because we believe
 
--Andrea:
Once in every life
There comes a time
--Marco:
We walk out on our own
And into the light

--Together:
The moment won't last, but then
We remember it again
When we close our eyes
 
--Together:
Like stars across the sky
E per avvincere tu divrai vincere
We were born to shine
All of us here because we believe
 
--Andrea, joined by Marco:
Non arrenderti qualcuno e con te
 
--Together:
Like stars across the sky
We were born to shine
E per avvincere dovrai vincere
E allora vincerai
