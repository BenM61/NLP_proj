We've been away for so long now
Found out life's coming back somehow
Over Bohemia and Moravia
We came from very far away

And while we kept on sailing
In our contaminated paradise

It'll be a lovely day tomorrow
It'll be a lovely day tomorrow
It'll be a lovely day tomorrow
It'll be a lovely death tomorrow

To find a beginning in an end
And halt the devils Mercedes Benz
Suspended in sidereal space
With a vacuum sound of horror

And while we kept on dancing
In our contaminated paradise

It'll be a lovely day tomorrow
It'll be a lovely day tomorrow
It'll be a lovely day tomorrow
It'll be a lovely death tomorrow

And while we kept on drinking
And then the air goes quiet
