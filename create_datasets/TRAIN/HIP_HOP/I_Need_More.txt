I can no longer see, myself being the girl for you, I used to be,
You've done so much to bring me down, when I think about, how you treated me, 
I no longer need, to try and be perfect for you, cause now I see, I'm just something to throw around, you were never down, just misleading me,

I need more, then what your giving, what your giving, 
I can't take no more,of being second in line of your eyes,
Heard it all before, time to even the score,
It'll be a cold day in hell before you see your girl, shed another tear, boy you better hear me

Friends is the phrase you used, to describe our relationship,it was the best for you, when the other girls would come around, you would have an out, to do the do, now I found in me, the strength to say the hell with you, and let it be, no more will I be sick and down, or thinking 'bout loving you

I need more, then what your giving, what your giving, 
I can't take no more,of being second in line of your eyes,
Heard it all before, time to even the score,
It'll be a cold day in hell before you see your girl, shed another tear, boy you better hear me

I can't deny I miss you (can't deny I do)
And I can't deny I wish you (wish you only knew)
How to treat a girl, who'd give her whole, world up to you, but I understand you now, you'll never appreciate somebody like me.

I need more, then what your giving, what your giving, 
I can't take no more,of being second in line of your eyes,
Heard it all before, time to even the score,
It'll be a cold day in hell before you see your girl, shed another tear, boy you better hear me
