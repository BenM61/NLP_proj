Mr. Greene
Asked me yesterday,
"Boy, what do you want to be?
With some work,
In ten years or so,
You could be sitting here just like me."
He said, "Your future looks crystal clear."
I just gotta get away from here.

I want to be an eagle, soaring high,
Sign my name across the sky.
I gotta break free, before I die.
Before another day,
Before another day goes by.
My mother said,
Just the other day,
"Boy, get your feet on the ground."
She looked at me
In such a way.
I said, "Ma,
Please don't bring me down,"
I said, "My future is crystal clear,
Just gotta get away from here."

Before I waste another minute.
Live my life without me in it.

I want to be an eagle, soaring high,
Sign my name across the sky.
I gotta break free, before I die.
Before another day,
Before another day goes by.
My mother said,
Just the other day,
"Boy, get your feet on the ground."
She looked at me
In such a way.
I said, "Ma,
Please don't bring me down,"
I said, "My future is crystal clear,
Just gotta get away from here."
