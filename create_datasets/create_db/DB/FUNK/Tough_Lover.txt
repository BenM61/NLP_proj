Well I've got a lover that moves me so
He show an old kind of rock n' roll
'Cause he's a tough lover (yeah, yeah)
He's a tough lover (woo)
Tough Lover (yeah, yeah)
Tough Lover (hum, hum)

When he kisses me
I get a thrill
But when he does that wiggle
I can't keep still
'Cause he's a tough lover (yeah, yeah)
He's a tough lover (woo)
Tough Lover (yeah, yeah)
Tough Lover (hum, hum)

The seven sisters got nothin' on him
I'm talkin' about love and he's fast as the wind
People are all talkin' about how he's got me fixed
It ain't hoodoo it's just that twist
He's the greatest lover ever come to pass
Don Juan ain't got the half of a chance
He can make you laugh
He can make you cry
He's so tough he'll make Venus come alive
He can do anything that he wants to do
Step on Jesse James's blue suede shoes

'Cause he's a tough lover (yeah, yeah)
He's a tough lover (woo)
Tough Lover (yeah, yeah)
Tough Lover (hum, hum)

That you wanna love right
Just (pops? i don't know this one) him on the head
Once or twice
He'll be a tough lover (yeah, yeah)
He'll be a tough lover (woo)
Tough lover (yeah, yeah)
Tough lover (hu, hu!)
