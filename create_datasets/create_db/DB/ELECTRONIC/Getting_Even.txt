So if you go
And leave recklessly
We can only be me
We can only be me
That's something I
Through the tons of my life
Never wanted to be
Never wanted to be

But if you stay
Just a bolt in the ball
Then you'll never know
Then you'll never know
How you could miss
Like the day light the way
You're missing us now
You're missing us now

So listen to some reason
There's nothing in your dreams
But if you're getting even
You're getting even
Trying to get even
Better start believing
I can forgive
And we can forget
Even after all this
Love and other nonsense we've made

Now if we kiss
Then the moon in the sky
We'd linger a while
We linger a while
So ask to give just an inch more of night
But you break from my life
No more kiss, no more I

But listen to some reason
There's nothing in your dreams
But if you're getting even
You're getting even
Trying to get even
Better start believing
I can forgive
And we can forget
Even after all this wrestling of conscience
I can forgive
And we can forget
Even after all this
Love and other nonsense

It's the worst part of the best of me, best of me
Love, I'm trying so hard to be free
Worst of the best of me, best of me
Love, I'm trying so hard to be free
Lonely but free
And out of love

If you're getting even
You're getting even
If you're getting even
You're getting even

If you're getting even
You're getting even
Trying to get even
Better start believing
I can forgive
And we can forget
Even after all this wrestling of conscience
I can forgive
And we can forget
Even after all this
Love and other nonsense
You're getting even
You're getting even
And I can forgive
And we can forget
You're getting even
You're getting even
And I can forgive
And we can forget
You're getting even
You're getting even
And I can forgive
And we can forget
You're getting even
You're getting even
(And I can forgive)
(And we can forget)
(You're getting even)
