A thousand thundering thrills await me 
Facing insurmountable odds gratefully 
The female of the species is more deadly than the male 

Shock shock horror horror 
Shock shock horror 
I'll shout myself hoarse for your supernatural force 
The female of the species is more deadly than the male 

Oh she deals in witchcraft 
And one kiss and I'm zapped 

Oh how can heaven hold a place for me 
When a girl like you has cast a spell on me 
Oh how can heaven hold a place for me 
When a girl like you has cast a spell on me 

Frankenstein and Dracula have nothing on you 
Jekyll and Hyde join the back of the queue 
The female of the species is more deadly than the male 

Oh she wants to conquer the world completely 
But first she'll conquer me discreetly 
The female of the species is more deadly than the male 

Oh she deals in witchcraft 
And one kiss and I'm zapped 

Oh how can heaven hold a place for me 
When a girl like you has cast a spell on me 
Oh how can heaven hold a place for me 
When a girl like you has cast a spell on me 

Oh how can heaven hold a place for me 
When a girl like you has cast a spell on me 
Oh how can heaven hold a place for me 
When a girl like you has cast a spell on me
