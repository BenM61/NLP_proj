I can't give it up all over you
I keep messin' up
That's what I do

If tonight is going right
We'll feel a little closer
Temptation, in overdrive

Movin' in, where I begin
No way, I'm gonna blow it
Sensations, they multiply

Ooh, come and get it
If you want it you got to come and get it yourself
Ooh, come and get it
If you want it you got to come and get it yourself
Ooh, come and get it
Ooh, come and get it

We'll wanna do it again
Fear, over ruled
I keep messin' up
That's what I do

If tonight is going right
We'll feel a little closer
Temptation, in overdrive

Movin' in, where I begin
No way, I'm gonna blow it
Sensations, they multiply
Ah ah ah

Ooh, come and get it
If you want it you got to come and get it yourself
Ooh, come and get it
If you want it you got to come and get it yourself
Ooh, come and get it
Ooh, come and get it

Come and get it
Come and get it
Come and get it yourself

Come and get it
Come and get it
Come and get it yourself

Ooh, come and get it
If you want it you got to come and get it yourself
Ooh, come and get it
If you want it you got to come and get it yourself
Ooh, come and get it

Ooh, come and get it
Come and get it yourself
