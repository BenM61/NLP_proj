Yeah, just like that
Ah-ha-ha-ha

Ooh, hoo, hoo
Yeah, yeah

When I'm with you, I hear a song
That makes me laugh and smile and sing to you
When I'm with you, I feel so free
I feel that love is going to take control of me

When I'm with you
It's for real (It's for real)
What I feel (What I feel)
When I'm with you (You), uh-huh

When I'm with you, I wonder why
People do stop and stare and smile at us
When I'm with you, the sun shines my way
Baby, our love reflects its rays of light on everyone in the world

When I'm with you
It's for real (It's for real)
What I feel (What I feel)
When I'm with you (You), Hey, hey, hey

Uh-huh (Special touch, a warm embrace)
A sweet and tender, your smile, whoa
Body warm my heart, so pure
Chills when I look, look in your eyes

I wonder why
People (Do stop) and stare (And stare and smile at us) and smile at us
When I'm with you, the sun shines my way
Baby, our love reflects its rays of light on everyone in the world

When I'm with you
It's for real (It's for real)
What I feel (What I feel)
When I'm with you (You), you, hey, hey, hey

Oh, girl
I love you, baby
Ye-ye-ye-yes, I do
Ye-ye-ye-yes, I do
I'd give the world to you, baby
Oh, whoa, oh, yeah

When I'm with you, whoa...baby
It's for real (It's for real)
What I feel (What I feel)
When I'm with you (You), yeah, yeah, eah, hey

Everything, everything's alright
When I'm with you
It's for real (It's for real, what I feel)
What I feel (You're heavy on my mind)
It's okay (It's okay, gonna pray)
Every day (Every day)
It's so nice (So nice), so right now (So right)
When I'm with you (You), nobody but you
Honey, I love you, yeah, ooh
