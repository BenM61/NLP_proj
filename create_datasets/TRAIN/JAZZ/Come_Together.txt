Here come old flattop
He come grooving up slowly
He got joo-joo eyeball
He one holy roller
He got hair down to his knee
Got to be a joker, he just do what he please

He wear no shoeshine
He got toe-jam football
He got monkey finger
He shoot coca-cola
He say "I know you, you know me"
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free
Come together right now over me

He bag production
He got walrus gumboot
He got Ono sideboard
He one spinal cracker
He got feet down below his knee
Hold you in his armchair you can feel his disease
Come together right now over me

He roller-coaster
He got early warning
He got muddy water
He one mojo filter
He say "One and one and one is three"
Got to be good-looking 'cause you're so hard to see
Come together right now over me
