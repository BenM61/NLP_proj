Early morning light
Anyone awake?
Let him kiss me on my mouth
For he loves me like I'm wine
Son of Solomon

I'm the darkest of them all
But you see the light in my soul
Will you kiss me on my mouth?
Will you love me like I'm wine?
Son of Solomon

Where you will go
I'll follow you
Follow you alone
I seek and you
You find me
Son of Solomon
My own

I never had a friend
In the dead of night
Will you kiss me on my mouth?
Will you love like I'm wine?
Son of Solomon

Where you will go
I'll follow you
Follow you alone
I seek and you
You find me
Son of Solomon
My own

Where you will go
I'll follow you
Follow you alone
I seek and you
You find me
Son of Solomon
My own

Where you will go
I'll follow you
Follow you alone
I seek and you
You find me
Son of Solomon
My own

Early morning light
Anyone awake?
Let him kiss me on my mouth
For he loves me like I'm wine
Son of Solomon
Will you kiss me on my mouth?
Will you love me like I'm wine?
Son of Solomon
