Bad weather gathers all along the coast
When the storm clouds gather
And my blood runs cold
If we can't go further
When we get to the shore
Then we have to turn around
And fight some more

We'll go together
I have room in my soul
That's enough of watching people
Trading hearts for gold
I can see you on the beach
On your knees
Spilling more salt in an
Already dead sea

We'll feel the wind and the rain
On our face
You can do it yourself
But I heard of a place

It's got to be now
And it better be together
When spirits make a meeting
You can feel it forever

Bad weather gathers all along the coast
When the storm clouds gather
And my blood runs cold
I can see you on the beach
On your knees
Spilling more salt in an
Already dead sea

Run away with me again
Time for us to grow
Run away with me again
All of us alone
