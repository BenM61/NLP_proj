Let's go suboceana
To the place where fish sleep
Down, deep, down under
And rock with the Dream King

He says

Trust me, just trust me
I live in your mind
I'll be your dream master
All of us know this
We're going inside
This is your life after

Boom boom chi boom boom
Boom boom chi boom boom
Boom boom chi boom boom
Boom boom chi boom boom

Put your face in my hands now
As the water washes us down
The pressure of your body solid
Making love without a sound

We see

White sheets of light
That prickle the skin
Colors extend
Moving out from within
If this is creation
Let's do it again

Let's stay down under
Way, way, way, down deep

Boom boom chi boom boom
Boom boom chi boom boom
Boom boom chi boom boom
Boom boom chi boom boom

Generations in a picture
Lay their heads down to sleep
Forgetting sin to remember
Way, way, way, down deep

They say

We are your future
From out of your past
We'll be here tomorrow
Pick up the pieces
As fragile as glass
We will hear your sorrow
Babies are born
They accept the bizarre
Moving beyond
Beyond life in a jar

Let's stay down under
Way, way, way, down deep.
