This is a song with a message
I want you to heed my warning

I wanna tell you all a story
About this chick I know
They call her "Amphetamine Annie"
She's always shoveling snow

I sat her down and told her
I told her crystal clear
"I don't mind you getting high
But there's one thing you should fear"

"Your mind might think its flying, baby
On those little pills
But you ought to know it's dying, 'cause
Speed kills"

But Annie kept on speeding
Her health was getting poor
She saw things in the window
She heard things at the door

Her mind was like a grinding mill
Her lips were cracked and sore
Her skin was turning yellow
I just couldn't take it no more

She thought her mind was flying
On those little pills
She didn't it was going down fast, 'cause
Speed kills

Well I sat her down and told her
I told her one more time
"The whole wide human race has taken
Far too much methedrine"

She said I don't care what a Limey says
I've got to get it on
I'm not here to just see no man
Who come from across the pond

She wouldn't heed my warning
Lord, she wouldn't hear what I said
Now she's in the graveyard, and she's
Awfully dead
