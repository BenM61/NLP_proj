'Cause I've been watchin' it all
'Cause I've been watchin' it all

You've been cheatin' while I'm sleepin'
And tellin' me lies
And you've been chasin' every girl in sight
You've been cheatin' and tellin' me lies
And you've been messin' round, it's over now

You've been creepin' while I'm sleepin'
And tellin' me lies
And you've been chasin' every girl in sight
You've been cheatin' and tellin' me lies
And you've been messin' round, it's over now

You've been creepin' while I'm sleepin'
And tellin' me lies
Cheatin' while I'm sleepin'
And tellin' me lies
Cheatin' while I'm sleepin'
And tellin' me lies

Cheatin' while I'm sleepin'
And tellin' me lies
Cheatin' while I'm sleepin'
And tellin' me lies
And you've been messin' round, it's over now

You've been cheatin' while I'm sleepin'
And tellin' me lies
And you've been chasin' every girl in sight
You've been cheatin' and tellin' me lies
And you've been messin' round, it's over now
