Time after time
You been coppin' mine but
Can I have a good time at your's tonight
Cause every time we try to get close
There is always something that I'm thinking about

(You want me)

You wanna me be
Somebody who I'm really not
You wanna me be
Somebody who I'm really not
You wanna me be
Somebody who I'm really not
You wanna me be
Somebody who I'm really not

A knock at the door
Then we hit the floor
And all I know is that you leave me wanting more
I don't let it show
But I think you know
Cause you're tweeting me like Tweety Bird on your iPhone

(You want me)

Somebody who I'm really not
You wanna me be
Somebody who I'm really not
You wanna me be
Somebody who I'm really not
You wanna me be
Somebody who I'm really not
