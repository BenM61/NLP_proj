I have always dreamed of this
I'll admit that there was something I missed
I'm wondering if it is for real
Every mistake
Every wrong turn
Every time I lost my way
Lead me to this
Moment of bliss tonight

With you
Finally I can break free
With you
It's all changing in my destiny
Dream come true
It's so funny now that I see
How different life turned out to be

You were always by my side
That you believed in me
Was enough reason why
I didn't stop
Didn't give up
Even if I sometimes lost hope
I did my best
And I am blessed in life

With you
Finally I can break free
With you
It's all changing in my destiny
Dream come true
It's so funny now that I see
How different life turned out to be

Can I get any higher?
Tell me
Does it get any stronger?
I owe it to you
That I made it through
I never could have done it
Without you

With you!
I can break free, yeah
It's all changing in my destiny
Dream come true
It's so funny now that I see
How different life turned out to be!

Oh, 'cause of you
It's all changing in my destiny
Dream come true
It's so funny now that I see...
