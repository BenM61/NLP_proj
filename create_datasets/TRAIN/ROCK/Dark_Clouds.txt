I think we need a holiday
A week or two in Mexico
The two of us
We'll leave the fools at home
Away from all the heartache
And the troubles we've suffered
In the last two weeks
Although they felt like years
We'll be free
No-one to bother you or me
Down in old Mexico let your inhibitions go
Dark clouds drift away to reveal sunshine
Dark clouds drift away to reveal sunshine
Two lovers in a cage
Trapped and ever so afraid
To step outside from the world we hide
The street life and the bright lights
Blind their eyes and send us running to obscurity
We need to break free
Trapped you see
Trapped here in mediocrity
Don't ever trust a soul on planet earth
Dark clouds drift away to reveal sunshine
Dark clouds drift away to reveal sunshine
Dark clouds drift away
Dark clouds drift away
Dark clouds drift away
To reveal sunshine
Dark clouds drift away
Dark clouds drift away
Dark clouds drift away
To reveal sunshine
