In the middle of the night
When the time is right
Sexily right

I'm gonna do the right thing
I'm feeling hot
I ain't ever gonna stop
To get what you got
You better take what I bring

I feel it now
Much harder now
More than any old how
Say you feel the pain

Feel I'm getting harder now
(Get off your back four, get on top more)
Feel I'm sinking farther down
(Get off your back four, get on top more)
I told you to stop
You're sleeping out a lot
You told me get lost
Where's your understanding

I feel it now
Much harder than I've ever done now, now
Hey, I'm gonna do the right thing

Feel I'm getting harder now
(Get off your back four, get on top more)
Feel I'm sinking farther down
(Get off your back four, get on top more)

In the middle of the night
When the time is right
Sexily right
I'm gonna do the right thing

I'm on fire now
You know I'm on fire now
You know I told you
That I would never dream of leaving now
If I did it right
