Uptight, every thing is all right
Outta sight, it's all right
There's light at the end of the tunnel
Pay at the end of the day

Thanks that me don't have to grumble
Goodness is coming our way
It's all right, it's all right
It's all right, it's all right

I do remember, I do recall
The magic moments when we stood so tall
A nation to be respected, a nation full of pride
So shake the bluesy feeling that is hurting you inside
Hurting you inside

There's better days ahead for us
You need not fret nor worry
Oh yes, this time around, my friend
I'm sure you won't be sorry

They say how the future
Is guided by your past
Through trials and tribulation
Yes, we were meant to last

So hold on to your hope and dreams
For all that it's worth
'Cause I know the day will come
When the meek shall inherit the world

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If you uptight, everything's all right
Outta sight, it's all right
They'll be better days, don't you worry
A positive way you won't be sorry
It's all right, it's all right
