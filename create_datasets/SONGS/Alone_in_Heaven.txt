Welcome to heaven, left from the lights, the number seven 
You have it all now, now that you've come to see the light 
Take it all in, an open mind 
Now you wonder, What if your heaven was someone else's hell? 

Heaven. What the hell would I do in that place without you? 
In heaven, alone in heaven, alone heaven, alone in heaven

Welcome to heaven! Can you believe the things you see here! 
Forever winter, summer of love, spring or fall 
It doesn't matter anymore 
Alone you wonder, 
Can this be heaven if my best friends burn in hell? 

Heaven. What the hell would I do in that place without you? 
In heaven, alone in heaven, alone heaven, alone in heaven
I can't see you here. Where have you all gone now? 
Don't know, but it hurts, to be all alone 
On the field where the stones grow dead names 

I'll never leave you behind, 
It's one for all, and all for life 

Still I wonder, 
Why go to heaven, when my best friends burn in hell? 

Heaven. What the hell would I do in that place without you? 
In heaven, alone in heaven, alone heaven, alone in heaven

Heaven. What the hell would I do in that place without you? 
In heaven, alone in heaven, alone heaven, alone in heaven

I can't see you here. Where have you all gone now? 
Don't know, but it hurts, to be all alone 
On the field where the stones grow dead names 

Heaven, 
Whatta hell would I do in that place without you, now? 
Whatta hell would I do in that place without you? 
Heaven.
