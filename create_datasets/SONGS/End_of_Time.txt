(Q-Tip) 
Just feelin' things out for real, ya know? 
Just want to do me for real, ya know? 
No reason to make it complicated, you feelin' agitated, 
You love it or you hate it f*ck it 
Desperation, jumpin' off of street corners here 
Hustlers looking for buzz like "pop one in here" 
Local state officials.yeah they out of touch 
Getting money for some, hey yo, ain't nothin' much 
But yo let them tell it, we smoke it and we sell it 
You don't understand, so don't tell it 
You sneakin' souls just for phat diamond golds 
cause our lady friends have likings for designer clothes 
People in my hood think.If I'm looking raggedy, then the cat is just a weak link 
In the very fake chain of oppression. 
If television taught me any lesson, 
it's "Image is Nothing",
but yo I got a thirst Nothing, 
but yo I got a thirst Nothing, 
but yo I got a thirst what's first? Your rings or your purse?

(Oh boyoh boy! Make your wagers back there! Step lively women and 
children first! The world is coming to an end! Come on now we're looking at 
the end! We have to leave them we have to leave all our paraphernalia's behind
(brought back brought back.)
(brought back brought back.)
(Let's go!) 
It's kinda scary you see. 
How fucked up things can be 
Each time you take a bath 
How it could have been your last 
There's so much shit around us 
Things we can't even see 
Is this the end of our line? 
That's where I want to be
That's where I want to be
That's where I want to be
That's where I want to be
