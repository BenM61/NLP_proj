Woah hoooo hooo wooo hooo hooo hoo hoo hoo
Thank you baby
I just wanna take a lit time out
Thank you baby
Thank you for your love
You came along and showed me life
A man can't live by bread alone
And you came along and taught me
That I, I just can't make it on my own
But while I thank you I thank the Lord above
For smiling down on me and blessing me blessing me with your love baby
Lonely was about to make me loose my mind
But you came along just in time
And I want to thank you baby
Thank you for your love
If you didn't hear me the first time I'm gone say it again
Thank you baby thank you for your love I wanna say it say it say it
Woah woah thank you baby for your love
Why I thank you
I thank the Lord above
For smiling down on me hey
And blessing me blessing me with your love baby
I love you girl I truly do
I don't how I'd make it without you
I wanna thank you baby
Thank you for your love
I 'm gonna say it again i'm gonna say it again
Well well thank you baby
I wanna thank you for your love baby
I wanna say it again I wanna say it again
Thank you for your love
