Through the long grass, past the tall trees 
There's a cabin that's a nestlin in the pines 
Where my sweethearts catchin small fish 
With a cane and a bent pin on a line 
And if you happen to pass by, please 
Come and join us join our company? 

There's my daddy on the front porch 
With a lazy hound lying by his feet 
And my mommie's in the kitchen 
With the table all ready set to eat 
So if you happen to pass by, please 
Come and join us join our company? and 

Oh Oh Oh I just want to be there
Underneath the sun and the deep, deep blue sky...and 
Oh Oh Oh I just want to be there
Even when it rains and it pours it's a paradise? 

Dooya doodn doo doo doo Dooya doodn doo doo doo 
Doo doo, doo doo, doo doo 

Dooya doodn doo doo doo Dooya doodn doo doo doo 
Doo doo, doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo 

Cousin Norman comes a courting 
With the same girl every single day 
Got a stammer,like a hammer 
You can't understand a word that he s-says 
So if you happen to pass by, please 
Come and join us join our company?and 

Oh Oh Oh I just want to be there
Underneath the sun and the deep, deep blue sky... and 
Oh Oh Oh I just want to be there
Even when it rains and it pours it's a paradise? 

Oh Oh Oh I just want to be there
Underneath the sun and the deep, deep blue sky... and 
Oh Oh Oh I just want to be there
Even when it rains and it pours it's a paradise? ?
