Is it so?
Are we moving too fast?
'Cause everything feels so slow
I do not know
It's pretty funny you asked
'Cause everything I feel is love
Baby, let go
Thinking maybe, crazy, face it
All that we know
Love is a show
That we playing, just saying
Let us lose control

I got a car
We got the love to take home
Life is so short
Let us enjoy our playground
Oh, let us just go
To a place we can call our own
Birds got the sky

All that we got are hearts of gold

Now that I see
That this feeling has bought me
Away from all the make-believe
Yes, we are free
We gotta lock up this feeling
Breathing in your energy

I got a car
We got the love to take home
Life is so short
Let us enjoy our playground
Oh, let us just go
To a place we can call our own
Birds got the sky

All that we got are hearts of gold
Hearts of gold

Find me in all things
Inside your heart
So captivated in all of these parts
I've been created to be in your arms
Nothing will change the way that we are
Aim all the lights upon us
See the reflection glow
After the fire has left us reborn

All that we got are these hearts of gold
