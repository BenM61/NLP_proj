The time is coming soon to say goodbye
A time of sadness it will be
But, honey, listen to my parting sigh
And linger on awhile with me

The stars above you yet linger awhile
They whisper I love you; oh, linger awhile
And when you have gone away
Every hour seems like a day
I've something to tell you
Oh, linger awhile

The stars above you yet linger awhile
They whisper I love you; oh, linger awhile
And when you have gone away
Every hour seems like a day
I've something to tell you
Oh, linger awhile
