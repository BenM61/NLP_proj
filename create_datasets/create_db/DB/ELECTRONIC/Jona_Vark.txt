She walks on the street
Alone in the dark
Her heads held up high
And she's got nothing to fear

As she crosses the road
She looks to the stars and asks for advice on where to go,
On where to go from here
Jona, Jona Vark,

Her name was Jona
Jona Vark
She found her place
Amongst the trees

She opened her eyes
And started to see
A flower in the distance
Showed her a way

To answer the questions
That we all like to ask
