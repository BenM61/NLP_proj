Oh baby, come and make a little love tonight 
Oh baby, come and make a little love tonight 
Come on and make a little love darlin', 
While the moon is shinin' bright 

Oh please, please make love tonight 
Oh please, please make love tonight 
I want you to make a little love darlin' 
While the moon is shinin' bright 

Oh baby, I'll buy you a diamond ring 
Oh baby, I'll buy you a diamond ring 
If you make a little love darlin', 
I'll give you most anything 

Oh baby, I'll buy you a house in town 
Oh baby, I'll buy you a house in town 
I want you to make a little love darlin', 
While there ain't no one around
