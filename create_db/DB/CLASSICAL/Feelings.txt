Feelings, nothing more than feelings
Trying to forget my feelings of love
Teardrops rolling down on my face
Trying to forget my feelings of love

Feelings, for all my life I'll feel it
I wish I've never met you, girl 
You'll never come again

Feelings, wo oh oh feelings
Wo oh oh, feel you again in my arms

Feelings, feelings like I've never lost you
And feelings like I've never have you again in my heart

Feelings, for all my life I'll feel it
I wish I've never met you, girl
You'll never come again

Feelings, feelings like I've never lost you
And feelings like I've never have you again in my life

Feelings, wo oh oh feelings
Wo oh oh, feel you again in my arms
Feelings

Feelings, wo oh oh feelings
Wo oh oh, feel you again in my arms
Feelings

Feelings, wo oh oh feelings
Wo oh oh, feel you again in my arms
Feelings
