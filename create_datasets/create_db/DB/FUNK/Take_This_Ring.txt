Lipstick, perfume
The moment all there, yeah
My girls waitin outside
High heels, tight dress
Moves that say hi
Don't even say goodbye

I remember once upon a time
When, when I
Would never ever
Do anything
To hurt you, oh yeah
But tonight I'm gonna

[Chorus:]
I'mma take this ring off
Take this ring off my, my finger
Take this ring off
Take this ring off my, my left hand
Get my thing off
Get my thing all the way off yeah

That's what I'mma do
That's what I'mma do
That's what I'mma do
That's what I'mma do

Don't tell nobody, no
Don't tell nobody, oh no
Don't tell nobody, yeah

Late night, I'm feelin nice
Tryin to make sure we, we can be alone
So I stepped out to party
Headed up to his place
Feels so right
Just cant be wrong

I remember once upon a time
When, when I
Would never ever
Do anything
To hurt you, oh yeah
But tonight I'm gonna
Tonight I'm gonna yeah

[Chorus]

That's what I'mma do (x 20)

Don't tell nobody, oh
Don't tell nobody, yeah
Don't tell nobody, yeah

Don't tell nobody
Don't tell nobody

I remember once upon a time
When, when I
I would never ever
Do anything
To hurt you
Do anything
To hurt you
Do anything
To hurt you
And I'm so sorry baby
But tonight I'm gonna

[Chorus]

That's what I'mma do (x 20)
Don't tell nobody, oh
Don't tell nobody, yeah
Don't tell nobody, yeah
Don't tell nobody
Don't tell nobody

I remember once upon a time
When, when I
I would never ever 
Do anything 
To hurt you 
Do anything 
To hurt you
Do anything 
To hurt you
And I'm so sorry baby
But tonight I'm gonna

[Chorus]
