Yeah, high, lay low, I don't think it's gonna go
The new neutralized race
You gotta get out while you can to start to understand
A new meaning of a change

Yeah, well we wanna get out, you know what's real
We're kickin' it as fast as we can
Because the minute they start dealing, it's the end of the free-wheelin'
No, beginning of the end

Yeah, we wanna get activated
Yeah, we wanna get activated
You cannot hold us back
You cannot hold us back with your dead world

Yeah, well you're lookin' for some trouble, trillion times on the double
Gotta double-cross their games
Yeah, well the meanings are the same, when you understand the games
Malfunction to the blame

Hiding out for situations, when the timings right you take 'em
Gotta play by your own rules (whoa, ho)
Patriotic rats tryin' to take all back
Don't step over us like we're fools, oh yeah

Yeah, we wanna get activated
Yeah, we wanna get activated
You cannot hold us back
You cannot hold us back with your dead world

Motherfucker, you cannot hold us back
You cannot hold us back
You cannot hold us back
You cannot hold us back

Fuckin' patriotic rats
Patriotic fuckin' rats
Fuckin' patriotic rats
Patriotic fuckin' rats

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
