We're suffering the calibre 
We're suffering the calibre
I drag me in and out,
I'm my own contraband
I'm catering the interests,
Of a market I strongly resent 
How crazy is that? 
How crazy is that can you feel that 
I mess around, I f*ck it up, somehow
I see us all getting administered
I mess around, I f*ck it up, somehow I see 
We're suffering, 
We're suffering the calibre
If these shackles are routine,
Then prison is surrender 
We're suffering the calibre.
If these shackles are routine, 
Then prison is surrender 
We're suffering the calibre
I drag me in and out, 
I'm my own contraband
I'm wired to these relays,
That even I can't circumvent 
How crazy is that? 
How crazy is that can you feel that
I mess around, I f*ck it up, 
Somehow I see us all getting administered
I mess around, I f*ck it up, somehow
I see we're suffering, 
We're suffering the calibre
If these shackles are routine,
Then prison is surrender
We're suffering the calibre
If these shackles are routine, then prison is surrender
We're suffering the calibre
The calibre.
The calibre is well incorporated 
The government is fully generated
Initiate the sequencer calibre
Calibre
We all get up tonight we're almost ready
I see we're suffering 
We're all getting administered
We all get up tonight 
We're almost ready
I see we're suffering 
We're suffering the calibre
If these shackles are routine, then prison is surrender
We're suffering the calibre .
