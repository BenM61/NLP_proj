(Kick it)

I'm not a phantom when it rains,
I'm like a phantom or a ghost those days,
Another man of his mistakes,
Too many cigarettes in my ash tray 
Faith I'm dying for its taste,
No point in trying to buy, what comes with faith.

(Kick it)

You gon' hear me singing like a siren,
Never shoot us down never silence,
Even when the bullies try to fight us,
You gon' hear me singing like a siren

This is the morphin' of forces
You just sit silent like corpses
While you keep pilin' that horse shit 
I sit on islands resortin'
The siren pulls you off courses
Until you crash on the shorses 
And if your bitch loved the sources 
She can blow like a porpoise 
Hahaha that shit be funny 
Out for the night but I might get cutty
One for the job and one for the money 
One for your moms and one for your buddy 
Oh good god I feel so goody 
Oh good god I feel so sunny
Got a good hunch like a munchkin tummy 
It's that time of the month I like shit bloody 
Fighters need the Heimlich 
Wanna hate but I'm too sick
Rhymin' with sublime and shit 
So you can just go climb a dick 

(Kick it)

You gon' hear me singing like a siren,
Never shoot us down never silence,
Even when the bullies try to fight us,
You gon' hear me singing like a siren,

I can't believe nobody told you we were dangerous 
It's like everywhere we go they try to anger us 
Try to keep my distance from the mysterious 
But they continue to be vicious so now I'm dangerous 
I'm going in, going in, 
Got no time for second guessing 
We ain't never looking back
(?)
What you see is what you get 
Leave no room for complications 
Can't believe nobody told you we were dangerous 
No-o-o

Never shoot us down never silence,
Even when the bullies try to fight us,
You gon' hear me singing like a siren
