Woke up this morning with a smile on my face
Jumped out of bed, took a shower, dressed, cleaned up my place
Made me some breakfast, toast, two scrambled eggs, grits
Grabbed my keys, grabbed my purse, grabbed my jacket
Off to work, beaming all the way down 3rd

Is it the way you love me baby
Is it the way you love me baby

Four thirty, can't wait to get home
Nah, girl, I got something else to do
Go 'head, really, get your groove on
'Cause tonight my man's coming through, yes

We gonna have to connect some other time
As much as I like to shake my thang on the dance floor
I got another nasty, freaky just right way in mind
Tonight I'm gonna beat the high score

Is it the way you love me baby
Is it the way you love me baby

Is it the way you love me baby
Is it the way you love me baby
