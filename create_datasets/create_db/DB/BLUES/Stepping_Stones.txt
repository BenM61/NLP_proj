Baby you've been up, broken down
Every man knows your name in this whole damn town
In every bar they know your drink, what should I think
I turned around to look and you gave some dude a wink
I thought I'd be happy with a woman like you,
But you walked on my pride and my manhood too
I don't know too much but one thing I know
A man stuck on you is like a stepping stone

Because you keep using me like a stepping stone
Because you keep using me like a stepping stone
Because you keep using me like a stepping stone
Because you keep using me like a stepping stone

What you forgot to mention, what was your real intention
Did you want a man to love, or someone to prop and carry you up
To a higher status, but the matter of fact is, your detachment
Will bring you further down and now you're all used up
Don't bother coming round

Because you keep using me like a stepping stone
Because you keep using me like a stepping stone
Because you keep using me like a stepping stone
Because you keep using me like a stepping stone

Well, I remember back to what you put me through
I keep thinking to myself
What's wrong with you
Ain't it enough to have a man for a lover and a friend
Tear him up and leave him when the money's spent
Well, you're just like delilah sittin' in her den
You take the strongest man and break 'em down again
But I have gained some knowledge
Go on pack your things and move back to college

Because you keep using me like a stepping stone
Because you keep using me like a stepping stone
Because you keep using me like a stepping stone
Because you keep using me like a stepping stone
