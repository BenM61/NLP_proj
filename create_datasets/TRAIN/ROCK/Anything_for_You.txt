Well I can't deny it
Don't wanna let go
Just wanna ride
High on ya love so
I got all the vibes that I need
Fills me up from my head to my feet
Well I can't describe it
So I put on a show
And then I act a little crazy when I'm feeling ya flow
Like dynamite you're a real go getter
I'm hypnotised, couldn't get much better

Bouncing on the town and here we go
Bouncing up and down on a roll
Turn on the lights
See my delights
Baby look at me here I go


I feel like jumping in the river
Taking all my clothes off
Swim butt naked
Till I get arrested
I'll do most anything for you
Cause I like your dirty attitude
Dancing on hot coals
Juggling with a chainsaws
Sleeping on a nail bed
All this and more
I'll do most anything for you
Yes anything for you

Well now I'm in trouble
Caught by the cops
For the love that I showed you out on the rocks
But that don't mean a thing to me
'cause when you're near me I'm feeling free
So give me the smile
That makes me go wild
Give me the look that got me so hooked
So tie me down before I explode
You're the best of all the feathers I ever did know

Bouncing on the town here we go
Bouncing up and down on a roll
Turn on the lights
See my delights
Baby look at me here I go
