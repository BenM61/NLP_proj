Love me, love me, love me, love me, lo
Love me, love me, love me, love me, lo
Love me, love me, love me, love me, love me
Love me, love me, love me, love me, lo

I need it, I need it when the moon is bright
I need it, I need it when you hold me tight
I need it, I need it in the middle of the night
I need your honey love

I want it, I want it when the lights are low
I want it, I want it just before you go
I want it, I want it because I love you so
Have a little of mercy and give some honey love

Now throw your arms around me
Pretend that you're lovey-dove
Now you squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze
Squeeze, squeeze, ooh, squeeze
That's a honey love

I'm gonna get it, get it in the morning sun
I'm gonna get it, get it when the day is done
I'm gonna get it, get it 'cause it's so much fun
I'm gonna get me some honey love

Yes, I love it, I love it 'cause it feels so fine
I love it, I love it, yes it thrills my spine
I love it, I love it 'cause you're mine all mine
I love your honey love

Love me, love me, love me, love me, lo
Love me, love me, love me, love me, lo
Love me, love me, love me, love me, love me
Love me, love me, love me, love me, lo

Let's you and me get closely
Just like the fingers in a glove
Let's kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss
That's a honey love

Ooh whee, I need it, I need it when the moon is bright
I need it, I need it when you hold me tight
I need it, I need it in the middle of the night
I need honey love

I need, oh yeah, honey love
I need, oh baby, honey love
I need, get it boy, honey love
I need your honey love
