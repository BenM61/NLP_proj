Break my shape - in light I trust
None exist save space and dust
None exist, just lights in time
Space divides the borderline
The borderline

Space between and space inside
My four walls my shape defines
Space defines

You've gotta get over yourself
You've got to get out of the frame
Gotta learn to see yourself a total stranger
You've got to get out of the frame
Give yourself a brand name
Gotta learn to see yourself a total stranger

It's a shock to my system
To wind up back where I have come from
It's a crime in my child's eyes
To find out life is in my mind

You've gotta get over yourself
You've got to get out of the frame
Gotta learn to see yourself a total stranger
You've got to get out of the frame
Give yourself a brand name
Gotta learn to see yourself a total stranger

It's a shock to my system
To wind up back where I have come from
It's a crime to my child's eyes
To find out life's disguise

Oh no
All gone
All gone
Nothing to hold me down
No
All gone
I'm gone
Nothing to hold me down
No
All gone
I'm gone
Nothing to hold me down
No
I'm gone
I'm gone
Nothing to hold me down

Calling, calling
Calling you to see through me
Calling, calling
Calling you to see through me

Calling
Calling
