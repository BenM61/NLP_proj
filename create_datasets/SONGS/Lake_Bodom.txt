Get me some division,
I called the dead by night to the god!
Allay the chaos!
Chains to my last victim!

Set up the lights on the way to the skies
Raising my sword to the lord!
Calling your death in a black obsession,
The only way wow!
Right!

So wait for salvation
Coming to me!
Life to the saint,
Life for me!

Your lord,
Who smashed this bloody god on earth,
Is tonight by my side,
Take me to the place to die for you,
And give me life in flames!

It's black after light,
An oddessey of the end,
A lord of chaos to be,
Searching my dreams of the lives in my vision
It's a night of war, yeah!

The son of the night was,
Left to destroy
I wait now to destroy...

Say,
Why this bloody god on earth,
Is always by my side,
Take me to the place where I die for you.

Yaaaaawwww!
The last song of hate
Is a song of my heart
Tonight's gonna be... Yeah!
Something wild!
