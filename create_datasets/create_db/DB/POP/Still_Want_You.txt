Everyone's got a combination
If you put in the time
The numbers come like a revelation
You show me yours I'll show you mine
And when you're down, girl, you got to know this
Nobody else is in your room
We'll make it through

Time is passing by still want you
Crime is on the rise still want you
Climate change and debt still want you
Nuclear distress still want you
The earth is heating up still want you
Hurricane and floods still want you
Even more than I did before

I used to think that I knew big time,
Before you came around
But I was up in the velvet gold mind
And you put my feet back on the ground
A piece of mind is a lot to ask for
These silly days but we got it made
Don't let it fade oh, no!

Time is passing by I still want you
Crime is on the rise I still want you
Climate change and debt I still want you
Nuclear distress I still want you
The earth is heating up I still want you
Hurricane and floods I still want you
Even more than I did before

And when your mind is made up
I'm gonna bring it down
When you got no time
You're gonna see it found
Your heart, grows cold
It's something on the line
Is hard for me to show
It's something you should know

Time is passing by I still want you
Crime is on the rise I still want you
Climate change and debt I still want you
Nuclear distress I still want you
The earth is heating up I still want you
Hurricane and floods I still want you
Even more than I did before

Time is passing by I still want you
Crime is on the rise I still want you
Nuclear distress I still want you
Climate change and debt I still want you
The earth is heating up I still want you
Hurricane and floods still want you
Even more, even more than I did before
