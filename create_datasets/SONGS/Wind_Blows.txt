I've got to breathe, you can't take that from me
'Cause it's all that you left that's mine
You had to leave and that's all I can see
But you told me your love was blind

I know there are times you're so impossible
That I should sign a waiver
And you will find someone worth walking on
When you ask me to go

I'll leave when the wind blows
Take a breath and away it goes
I'll be outside of your window
I'll pass by but I'll go slow
I'll leave when the wind blows

There was a day you threw our love away
Then you passed it to someone new
You wanna stay but since you wanna play
We can finally say we're through

I know there are times you're so impossible
And you ask me to go

I'll leave when the wind blows
Take a breath and away it goes
I'll be outside of your window
I'll pass by but I'll go slow

I'll leave when the wind blows
You can scream there's just echoes
I'll pass outside of your window
You'll be sad that you let me go
I'll leave but just know

As I lay in solitude, oh what's a boy supposed to do?
I shake the very thought of you, me together I remember
Late nights when I stayed up late all I do is wait and wait
You're never coming home to me, that's the hardest thing to see

I've got to breathe, you can't take that from me
I can finally say we're through

I'll leave when the wind blows
Take a breath and away it goes
I'll be outside of your window
I'll pass by but I'll go slow

I'll leave when the wind blows
You can scream there's just echoes
I'll pass outside of your window
You'll be sad that you let me go
On every face you'll ever know
And everywhere you'll ever go
You'll feel when the wind blows
