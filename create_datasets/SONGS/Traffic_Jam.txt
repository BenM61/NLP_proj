I thought a train crashed into our garden
Will we notice the noise?
Will it make us sit up and turn off the T.V.?
Out of focus and out of moments

Remember, this is ours

And all I want is someone to pull me out
I'm stuck in a traffic jam
With no where to run for miles
And all I want is someone to pull me out
I'm stuck in a traffic jam
With no where to run for miles

I'm scared of what you might tell me
I see your mouth move
But I don't hear a word that you say
I'm so sorry, I'm not better at love

Just remember that this is ours

And all I want is someone to pull me out
I'm stuck in a traffic jam
With no where to run for miles
And all I want is someone to pull me out
I'm stuck in a traffic jam
With no where to run for miles

Come here and find me
I'll be waiting
Come here and find me
And I'll be waiting

Come here and find me
I'll be waiting
Come here and find me

I'm stuck in a traffic jam
With no where run for miles
I'm stuck in a traffic jam
With no where to run for miles

And all I want is someone to pull me out
I'm stuck in a traffic jam
With no where to run for miles
