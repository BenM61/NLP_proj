I got a split personality
Do I love me more than I love you
And if you're gone will I see clarity?
Or will i just feel like we got down fooled

This could go any way
This could end any day
Should I listen to my heart or my friends eh?
Or this could be happy days
Our love won't evaporate
This could be just a phase we're going through

Two lives, living two lives
I don't know which side of me is where the truth lies
I'm living two lives, living two lives
I got two sides of me tryna do right
I got one on each shoulder, both saying 'I told ya'
One is saying 'go' and the other's saying 'no, no, no.'
living two lives
don't know which side of me is where the truth lies
where the truth lies.

Yo, I had a split personality
I thought I loved me more than I loved you
Don't make me beg like a charity
Cos now I see me without you, won't do

This could go any way
This could end any day
Should I listen to my heart or my friends eh?
Or this could be happy days
Our love won't evaporate
This could be just a phase we're going through

Two lives, living two lives
I don't know which side of me is where the truth lies
I'm living two lives, living two lives
I got two sides of me tryna do right
I got one on each shoulder, both saying 'I told ya'
One is saying 'go' and the other's saying 'no, no, no.'
living two lives
don't know which side of me is where the truth lies
where the truth lies, lies.

Two lives, living two lives
I don't know which side of me is where the truth lies
I'm living two lives, living two lives
don't know which side of me is where the truth lies
where the truth lies

(Where's it gone?)

Where the truth lies

(Where'd you go?)

(Where'd you go, where'd you go?)

Two lives, living two lives
don't know which side of me is where the truth lies,
where the truth lies
