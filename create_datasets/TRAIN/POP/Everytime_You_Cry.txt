I'm not the one to tell you what clothes to wear
I'm not the one who talks about your hair
I'm not the one to show you how I feel inside
I'm not the one to say how much I care

Every time you cry I cry just a little bit
Cry just a little bit
When you say goodbye, I die just a little bit
Cry just a little bit more

I know it's late, I guess I should have called today
I know you're tired of waiting by the phone
I know you say-you just don't know how long you'll wait
I know that you can't live your life alone

Every time you cry I cry just a little bit
Cry just a little bit
When you say goodbye, I die just a little bit
Cry just a little bit more

In a world where you think there's no one but you
But every time you need someone to dry your eyes
You call my name and know that I'll be there

Every time you cry I cry just a little bit
Cry just a little bit
When you say goodbye, I die just a little bit
Cry just a little bit more
