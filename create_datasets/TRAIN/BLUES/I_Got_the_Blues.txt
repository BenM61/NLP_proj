sometimes i sang the blues when I know i should be praying
sometimes i sing the blues
when i know i should be praying
for i share the worlds troubles is why i feel this way
i wake up some mornings
feel like I wanna cry
i began to sing the blues
to ease my worried mind
born with emotions
song in my soul
other parts of my story
it may never be told
if i only knew when my trouble would end
if i only knew when my troubles would end
i kiss bad luck goodbye and start all over again
