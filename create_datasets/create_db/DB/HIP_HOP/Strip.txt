Take it off I wanna love you and everybody wanna touch you
You movin' right wanna see what's up under
Then back it up, beep beep like a trucker
Nice thighs, nice waist,
And you know I can't forget about your face
But don't none of that matter
I'm about to make your pockets fatter

Girl I just wanna see you strip, right now 'cause it's late babe
Girl I just wanna see you strip, girl take your time with it
Girl I just wanna see you strip damn you're sexy (for me)
God damn you're sexy! (baby) damn you're sexy!
Girl I just wanna see you

Got my shades on with my J's on
In the club with a pocket full of ones
This girl, booty out of control
There she go up and down the pole
Which one I'm take home get my freak on
If you ain't freaking we ain't speaking
You think I'm playing, no I'm not
Let me see you back it up and drop
Yeah, I wanna see your legs, in the air
Baby don't worry about your hair all those tracks
I don't give a damn about that
In the club they're playing my song,
Turn it up, play it all night long
If you think you can, and you know you can
I'ma give you all this money money money

Girl I just wanna see you strip, right now cause it's late babe
Girl I just wanna see you strip, girl take your time with it
Girl I just wanna see you strip damn you're sexy (for me)
God damn you're sexy! (baby) damn you're sexy!
Girl I just wanna see you

Pants, shirt, you can take it off, panties, bra, you can take it off
Red bottom heels, you can take 'em wait, wait,
Leave 'em on, cause I like my woman tall!
Got a hot momma, you're hotter than a sauna
I wanna peel them clothes off your body like a banana
The only reason I dress you in that designer (how you do that)
Is to get you out that Dolce and Gabbana!
I throw this money up, she watch it all fall, toot that thing up for a boss
Anything you're wanting baby, you can have it all
Starting with my last name now they call you Mrs. McCall

Girl I just wanna see you strip, right now cause it's late,babe
Girl I just wanna see you strip, girl take your time with it
Girl I just wanna see you strip damn you sexy (for me)
Damn you sexy! (baby) damn you sexy!
Girl I just wanna see you (see you, see you, see you)
