I want to take you to Parisian
Buy you all the things you want
I'll take you shopping out of season
Buy you summer clothes in the fall

We can get freaky on the highway
On the way to Lennox mall
We'll have a pleasant conversation
I can't wait till we do it all baby

Roll wit me, I'll show you around, I'll take you where you should be
And we can put it down, why don't you roll wit me?
I'll show you around, I'll take you where you should be
And we can kick it round town, why don't you roll wit me?

Now let me tell you what I'm thinking
Theres a place for me and you
We can meet at intermezzo
Maybe have a drink or two

How 'bout a picnic on Sunday?
Would piedmont park be cool
(It'd be cool)
Well heres my number , won't you call me
I can't wait to hear from you

Why won't you roll wit me?
(Yeah)

I'll show you around, I'll take you where you should be
And we can put it down,  why don't you roll wit me?
I'll show you around, I'll take you where you should be
And we can kick it round town, why don't you roll wit me?

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

And we can put it down, why don't you roll wit me?
I'll show you around, I'll take you where you should be
And we can kick it round town, why don't you roll wit me?
