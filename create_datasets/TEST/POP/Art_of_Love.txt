I'm saying sorry in advance cos this won't always go to plan
Though we don't mean to take our love for granted
It's in our nature to forget what matters
How when the going is getting tough
And we're all about giving up
Things that we never thought we'd gonna say, gonna say them
Things that we never thought we'd play, gonna play them
It ain't perfect, but it's worth it
And it's always getting better
It's gonna take some time to get it right

'Cause I'm still learning the art of love
I'm still trying to not mess up
So whenever I stumble let me know
You need to spell it out
You need to spell it out
You need to spell it out
You need to spell it out for me
Cause I'm still trying to learn the art of love

If I forget to get the door
Remind you that you're beautiful
I know my detail requires more attention
If I ever hurt you it's not my intention
'Cause we're gonna make our mistakes
Find out how much your heart can take
But I know that you got my back
And baby I got yours

'Cause I'm still learning the art of love
I'm still trying to not mess up
So whenever I stumble let me know
You need to spell it out
You need to spell it out
You need to spell it out
You need to spell it out for me
'Cause I'm still trying to learn the art of love

Sometimes I'm gonna miss
I'm still learning how to give
I'm not giving up
I'm still learning how to love
Learning how to love'
Learning how to love

'Cause I'm still learning the art of love
I'm still trying to not mess up
So whenever I stumble let me know
You need to spell it out
You need to spell it out
You need to spell it out
You need to spell it out for me
'Cause I'm still trying to learn the art of love
(The art of love)

Still learning (art of love)
Still learning (art of love)
Still learning (art of love)
Still trying to learn the art of love
Still learning, I'm still learning (art of love)
Still learning (art of love)
I'm gonna get it sometimes, cause I'm still learning
Still learning (art of love)
Still learning (art of love)
Still learning (art of love)
The art art of love
