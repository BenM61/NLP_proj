Someday, evermore
Someday, evermore
Someday, evermore
Someday, evermore

Son, you better go for it
Harmony
Dissatisfaction
In a pocket
Full of lies
Cause I guess that's what they want

Son, your father's known for it
Misery
Can you read my lips
Cause this is my way of breaking ties
Is it true that's what you want

We know this color coating can't be right
When the only truth is that we don't sleep at night

Can it feel real

We're just trying to beat the system
But it's hard from a distance
We keep falling for the system
So it's time for a new better way
We're just trying to beat the system
And it's time for a new better way

Lie
Now your people need to get high
Everybody needs a little sunshine
From a blood red sky
Cause that's just what they want

We know this color coating can't be right
When the only truth is that we don't sleep at night

Can it feel real

We're just trying to beat the system
But it's hard from a distance
We keep falling for the system
So it's time for a new better way
We're just trying to beat the system
And it's time for a new better way

We're just trying to beat the system
But it's hard from a distance
We keep falling for the system
So it's time for a new better way
We're just trying to beat the system
And it's time for a new better way

Better way
Better way
Better way
Better way

Someday, evermore
Someday, evermore
Someday, evermore
Someday, evermore
