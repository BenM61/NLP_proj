It was late after midnight
I was sitting in a tavern
I saw him playing cards
And I went over to the old man
He said, "I read inside the cards
All about your life
Do you want to know it?
So listen to me"

The Queen of Hearts
The Queen of Hearts knows about life
She knows all about the heartache
Of the lovers in the night
Can't you try to read the signs?
The Queen of Hearts
The Queen of Hearts knows about fate
And the Queen of Hearts, she's telling me,
"Run home to your love
Run before it is too late"

He shuffled all his cards
And then he started dealing
The Jack of Clubs, then Queen of Hearts
I didn't know the meaning
He said, "You'll lose your lover"
I did not believe a word
But when I got back home
My baby was gone

The Queen of Hearts
The Queen of Hearts knows about life
She knows all about the heartache
Of the lovers in the night
Can't you try to read the signs
The Queen of Hearts
The Queen of Hearts knows about fate
And the Queen of Hearts, she?s telling me,
'Run home to your love,
Run before it is too late

The Queen of Hearts
The Queen of Hearts knows about life
She knows all about the heartache
Of the lovers in the night
Can't you try to read the signs
The Queen of Hearts
The Queen of Hearts knows about fate
And the Queen of Hearts, she's telling me
Run home to your love,
Run before it is too late
