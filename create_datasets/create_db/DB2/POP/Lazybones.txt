Oh-oh, you a good-for-nothing lazybones
Long as there is chicken gravy on your rice 
Everything is nice
As long as there's a watermelon on the vine
Everything is fine
You got no time to work, you got no time to play
You're busy doin' nothing all the livelong day
But you won't ever change, no matter what I say
You're just made that way

Lazybones, sleeping in the sun
How you 'spect to get your day's work done?
You'll never get your day's work done
Sleeping in the noonday sun

Lazy bones, sleeping in the shade
How you 'spect to get your cornmeal made?
You'll never get your corn meal made
Sleeping in the evening shade

Now when them 'taters need sprayin' I know you keep prayin'
That the bugs fall off their vine
And when you go fishing I bet you keep wishing
That the fish won't grab at your line

You know, lazybones, loafin' all the day
How you 'spect to make a dime that way?
You'll ever make a dime that way
You never hear a word I say

Now when them 'taters need sprayin' I know you keep prayin'
That the bugs fall off their vine
And when you go fishing, I know you keep wishing
That the fish won't grab at your line

You know, lazybones, loafin' all the day, tell me
How you 'spect to make a dime that way?
Oh, you'll ever make a dime that way, well lookee here
You never heared a word I say
A-sleepin' all the day, you a good-for-nothing lazybones
