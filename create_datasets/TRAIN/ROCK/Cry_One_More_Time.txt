Cry one more time for you
I really got it bad
Cry one more time for you
I lost the best I had

Everthing's gone wrong
I need another beer
She's got her mind on leavin'
That's what I'm doin' here

Ain't no sense to talkin'
I don't know what I'd say
Ain't no sense to argue
She just don't want to stay

Cry one more time for you
I really got it bad
Cry one more time for you
Lost the best I had

So sad to be alone at night
Woah, so sad it didn't work out right

Cry one more time for you
I really got it bad
Cry one more time for you
Lost the best I had

Tried to call her last night, yes I did
I knew she wasn't in
I don't want to go uptown
I know she'll be with him

So, cry one more time for you
I really got it bad
Cry one more time for you
Lost the best I had
Lost the best I had
Lost the best I had
Lost the best I had
Lost the best I had
