We be facing the sun
Waiting for these things to come
We smiling high
Watching the good things passing by
Pretend to feeling fine
But inside we're crying sometimes
It ain't what it seems
Nothing but a dream

And the faces get a void
And the lines get to thin
And the roads become uneven
So we don't know where've we been
And those who doubt us
Will soon believe
We were never supposed to win
Or even to achieve
