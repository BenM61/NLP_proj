Rattle big black bones in the danger zone
There's a rumblin' groan down below
There's a big dark town, it's a place I've found
There's a world going on underground

They're alive, they're awake
While the rest of the world is asleep
Below the mineshaft roads it will all unfold
There's a world going on underground

All the roots hang down
Swing from town to town
They are marching around down under your boots
All the trucks unload
Beyond the gopher holes
There's a world going on underground
