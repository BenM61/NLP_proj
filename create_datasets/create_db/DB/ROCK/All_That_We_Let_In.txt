Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

Dust in our eyes our own boots kicked up
Heartsick we nursed along the way we picked up
You may not see it when it's sticking to your skin
But we're better off for all that we let in

We've lost friends and loved ones much too young
There were so much promise and work left undone
When all that guards us is a single center line
And the brutal crossing over when it's time

Ooh
(Well, I don't know where it all begins)
Ooh
(And I don't know where it all will end)
Ooh
(We're better off for all that we let in)

One day those toughies will be withered up and bent
The father-son, the holy warriors and the President
With glory days of put up dukes for all the world to see
Beaten into submission in the name of the free

We're in an evolution, I have heard it said
And everyone's so busy now but do we move ahead
The planets hurling and atoms splitting
And a sweater for your love you sit there knitting

Ooh
(Well, I don't know where it all begins)
Ooh
(And I don't know where it all will end)
Ooh
(We're better off for all that we let in)

See those crosses on the side of the road
Tied with ribbons in the medium
They make me grateful, I can go this far
Lay me down and never wake me up again

Kat writes a poem and she sticks it on my truck
We don't believe in war and we don't believe in luck
The birds were calling to her, what were they saying
As the gate blew open in the tops of the trees were swaying

I've passed the cemetery, walk my dog down there
I read the names in stone and say a silent prayer
When I get home, you're cooking supper on the stove
And the greatest gift of life is to know love

Ooh
(Well, I don't know where it all begins)
Ooh
(And I don't know where it all will end)
Ooh
(We're better off for all that we let in)
