Love, love me.
Love me clean,
Love me new.
Love, love me.
Understand I live for you

When the storm is spoken,
The silence is broken.
Won't you be my only baby?
When the doubt is over
And I move in closer,
Move for me, my only baby.

Love, love me.
Love me fresh,
Love me free.
Love, love me.
Take this heat and die for me.

When the storm is spoken,
The silence is broken.
Won't you be my only baby?
When the doubt is over
And I move in closer,
Move for me, my only baby.

Breathe for me.
Be for me
Only.

When the storm is spoken,
The silence is broken.
Won't you be my only baby?
When the doubt is over
And I move in closer,
Move for me, my only baby.

Help me through
Help me through
Help me through
Help me through
These bitter days.
Only baby.
Only
