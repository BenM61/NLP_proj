Well there it is in black and white
No need to read between the lines
You made it clear to the letter
You're breaking off the chains that bind
I want to tell you but I'm drawing a blank

Ink and Paper - 
Were quite enough to make it clear
Ink and Paper - 
And the words keep ringing in my ears
Ink and Paper -
A broken heart in black and white

So many miles separate us
And they've come between us in the end
Once upon a time you said forever
But this is now and that was then
I want to tell you but I'm drawing a blank

Ink and Paper - 
Can't seem to put it down tonight
Ink and Paper - 
Can't find the words to write
Ink and Paper - 
How can I make them change your mind

I want to tell you but I'm drawing a blank

Ink and Paper - 
Not quite enough to make it clear
Ink and Paper -
And her words keep ringing in my ears
Ink and Paper - 
A broken heart in black and white
