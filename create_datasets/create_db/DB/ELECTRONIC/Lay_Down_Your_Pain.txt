I can hear
Your voice, your voice
Calling from the window
When you yelled that night
I didn't understand at all

But you hurt
And you cried
And you're mad
And you're angry at the world
You want to tear it down
You want to pull it down, down down
Come on and lay down
Lay down, lay down your pain

Having you here, feels good
Feels good inside the afternoon
And no one else
Could ever take away that, man
You wanted love
But have you fear
You wanted love but it's the fear
And yet the fear it feels so real
And you run, run away
Running from the pain, the pain
Come on and lay down
Lay down, lay down your pain

Don't you see
This world
This world can be what you want
Don't give it up, boy
Don't you give it up, don't give it
Don't you give it up, boy
You wanted love
You wanted joy
You wanted simple things in life

The world, the world is a better place
And this world is a better place
Yes, the world is a better place
1234567 all good girls go to heaven
That's what they say
1234567 all good boys go to heaven
That's what they say
Cause the world is a better place
Yes, the world is a better place

Come on, come on and lay down
Won't you lay down this pain
The world is a better place
Lay down your pain
