Kids these days
They want it all
They just trip
Trip and fall
It's all wasted
It's all wasted
I'm tired of their knocking
My tired head starts acting up, oh

If the world starts waking these kids up
From their games and their dark black makeup
Everywhere
I just can't shake it
I'm gonna take them away

If the world starts waking these kids up
From their games and their dark black makeup
Everywhere
I just can't shake it
I'm gonna take them away

Kids these days
They want it all
They just trip
Trip and fall
It's all wasted, all wasted
I'm tired of their knocking
I'm at the end
I've had enough, oh

If the world starts waking these kids up
From their games and their dark black makeup
Everywhere
I just can't shake it
I'm gonna take them away

If the world starts waking these kids up
From their games and their dark black makeup

I just can't shake it
I'm gonna take them away

From their games and their dark black makeup
Everywhere
I just can't shake it
I'm gonna take them away

They want it all
But they just can't take it
They'll never know but they'll always fake it
Everywhere and everyone of them is wasted
I'm gonna take them away

Anywhere
I just can't shake it
I'm gonna take them away
