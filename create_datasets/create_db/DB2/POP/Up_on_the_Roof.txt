When this old world starts a getting me down
And people are just too much for me to face
I'm gonna climb way up to the top of the stairs
And all my cares just drift right into space

On the roof, it's peaceful as can be
And there the world below don't bother me
No, no

So when I come home feeling tired and beat
I go up where the air is fresh and sweet 
I get far away from the hustling crowd
And all that rat race noise down in the street

On the roof, that's the only place I know
Look at the city, baby
Where you just have to wish to make it
So let's go up on the roof

At night the stars, they put on a show for free
And darling, you can share it all with me
That's what I say
Keep on telling you that

The right smack dab in the middle of town
I've found a paradise
Just about trouble proof 
And if this old world starts a getting you down
There's room enough for two up on the roof

Up on the roof, up on the roof, oh now
Everything is alright, everything is alright
Come on

Drop what you're doing tonight
And climb up the stairs with me and see
We got the stars up above us and the city lights below
Oh
Up on my roof now
