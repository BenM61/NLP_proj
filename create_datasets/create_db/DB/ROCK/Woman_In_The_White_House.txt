Don't you think it's time we put a woman in the White House
With a whole new attitude
We could use a little female common sense
Down on Pennsylvania Avenue

After 230-something years of waiting
It's way past overdue
Yeah, I think it's time we put a woman in the White House
Girls, how about you?

Well we like to spend money
But not money we ain't got
And we can balance a checkbook
And girls let me tell you what

It's time to clean up capitol hill
With a shovel and a pair of high heels
We've seen what the good ol'boys cand do
Now it's our turn to take a shot

Don't you think it's time we put a woman in the White House
With a whole new attitude
We could use a little female common sense
Down on Pennsylvania Avenue

After 230-something years of waiting
It's way past overdue
Yeah I think it's time we put a woman in the White House
Girls, how about you?

There'd be a lot less fussing
And fighting and carrying on
There'd be a lot more loving
And listening and getting along

Just look at the mess we're in
Heck, I'd vote for Loretta Lynn
I guarantee that we'd all be
Singing a different song

Don't you think it's time we put a woman in the White House
With a whole new attitude
We could use a little female common sense
Down on Pennsylvania Avenue

After 230-something years of waiting
It's way past overdue
Yeah I think it's time we put a woman in the White House
Girls, how about you?

Well after 230-something years of waiting
It's way past overdue
Yeah I think it's time we put a woman in the White House
Girls, how about you?

Don't you think it's time we put a woman in the White House
Girls, how about you?
