I can tell because it's plain to see
I can tell the way you look at me
The way, you know, you hold my hand
Yes, pretty baby, I can understand
I can tell, I can tell
I know you don't love me no more

A-no more, no more
No more, a-no more, no more
I can tell, I can tell
I know you don't love me no more

I asked your mama and your papa, too
What more can a poor man do?
You been runnin' with a heart-breaker child, around
Yes, I know why's that you put me down
I can tell, I can tell
I know you don't love me no more

Well, you won't answer yo' telephone
When I knock on your door hey say that you ain't home
Your sister let me in and tell me I can wait
When you come home you show up real late
Now, I can tell
Oh, I can tell
I know you don't love me no more

No more
I said, no more
No more
No more

Baby, I can give you romance
Only if you give me another chance
I'll cook your food and wash your clothes
I promise I'll keep you warm when it get cold
I can tell
I can tell
I know you don't love me no more
