Can't help myself , bad habits
Well I'm running wild, lost control
And it's a shame to think
That a boy like me
Has got so many , bad habits

Well I'm off the rails
My resistance fails tempations got 
A hold on me
And I can't refuse
Because I always lose
Can't help myself 
Bad habits

Well it just ain't right
That it's something I can't fight
I can't stop going out and having fun
Well I tried to be good, 
But I knew I never could
Cause I've got more bad habits than anyone

When I get the urge
I just got to splurge
I'm a slave to all my desires
Well I'm in a mess
Because I can't repress all of these 
Bad habits

Can't help myself
Bad Habits
Well I'm running wild
Lost control
And it's a shame to see 
That a boy like me
Has so many bad habits

Well it just ain't right
It's something I can't fight
I can't stop going out and having fun
Well I tried to be good
But I knew I never could
Cause I've got more bad habits
Than anyone

When I get the urge
I just got to splurge
I'm a slave to all my desires
Well I'm in a mess
Because I can't repress all of these 
Bad habits

All of these Bad habits x3
