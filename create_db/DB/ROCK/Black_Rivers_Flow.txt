Stay the course for a mass destruction
The innocence begins to fade
An uproar of wealthy poison
Insurance to be paid
In a fail proof act of grievance
Bait the weak with solemn lies
Full steam ahead to prison
Sentenced till the afterlife

Darkened sky with the truth below
Shadows multiply and black rivers flow
Surging down into everything we know
The emptiness of an open sea
Turned black inside failed misery
Fuel the hate of the black rivers flow

Set sail for oblivion
Mapped out by our ignorant hand
Put the blame on another dominion
The only choice we had
The shattered coast begins to blacken
Along with hope of recovery
Abandon ship that we call this planet
And plead for our sanity

Darkened sky with the truth below
Shadows multiply and black rivers flow
Surging down into everything we know
The emptiness of an open sea
Turned black inside failed misery
Fuel the hate of the black rivers flow

Tear them down one by one 
Compensate obliterate
For what theyve done
As black waves drift across the sun
Drown them all make the call
We cannot wait we will not wait
Let them fall
Drift down until their broken bodies become blackened salt

Darkened sky with the truth below
Shadows multiply and black rivers flow
Surging down into everything we know
The emptiness of an open sea
Turned black inside failed misery
Fuel the hate of the black rivers flow
