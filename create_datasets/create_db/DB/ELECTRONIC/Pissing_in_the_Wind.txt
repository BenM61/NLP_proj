I've, been pissing in the wind
I chanced a foolish grin, and dribbled on my chin
Now the ground, shifts beneath my feet
The faces that I greet, never know my name

Just give me something
I'll take nothing
Just give me something
I'll take nothing

Now the drought, is crippled by the rain
It hammers on my pain, we lose ourselves again
But all we need, is to a find a place to look
A worm is on its hook, our love which dangles free
Lets watch it swim, against the water's flow
In doubt your courage grows, with no guarantee

Just give me something
I'll take nothing
Jive give me something
I'll take nothing

And so it goes, a morale to the tale
As tortoise catches snail, the strong heart will prevail

It keeps on pumping, it still needs something
Just give it something, I'll take nothing
Just give it something, to keep it pumping
I'll take nothing, just give me something
