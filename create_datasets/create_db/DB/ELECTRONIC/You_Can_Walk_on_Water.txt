Baby you can walk on water

Tell me 
What you need to know
About the destiny before
Before it fades away
Maybe I could
Try to understand
What you feel inside i know,
You'll make it through someday.

Baby you can walk on water 
Baby you can fly like a bird
You can walk through a fire
Without even getting hurt
Baby you can breathe once again
You can reach the highest mountain
You can do what you want
It's up to you

Baby you can walk on water

Sometimes when I think of you
I feel the magic to the heart
It's all matter of faith
You see i know
What is wrong inside
You have to give it time and than
You'll make it through someday

Baby you can walk on water 
Baby you can fly like a bird
You can walk through a fire
Without even getting hurt
Baby you can breathe once again
You can reach the highest mountain
You can do what you want
It's up to you

Baby you can walk on water
