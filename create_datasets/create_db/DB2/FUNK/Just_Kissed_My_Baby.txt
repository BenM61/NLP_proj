I feel like a king
'Cause I just kissed my baby
And money don't mean a thing to me, no
'Cause I just kissed my baby
Feels so good, ha
That I just kissed my baby
Well, well, well I'm no (?)
'Cause I just kissed by baby

Well, well, well, ya
I know I can't go wrong
All we ever do, ha
Is decide to get along, yeah

I feel brand new
'Cause I just kissed by baby
And I'm going back to (?) too
'Cause I just kissed by baby
And I feel so doggone great, just can't wait
Just kissed by baby
Me and my girl need to hibernate
'Cause I just kissed by baby

Well, well, well
Just kissed my baby
Just kissed my baby
Just kissed my baby
Just kissed my baby
Just kissed my baby
Just kissed my baby

Just kissed by baby

'Cause I just kissed by baby
Just got so bad
Just kissed my baby

Just kissed by baby
Keep a-walking, keep a-moving
