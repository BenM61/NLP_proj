I am loved, I am loved by the one I love in every way,
I am loved, absolutely loved,
What a wonderful thing to be able to say.
I'm adored, I'm adored by the one who first led my heart astray,

I'm adored, absolutely adored,
What a wonderful thing to be able to say.
So ring out the bells, and let the trumpets blow,
And beat on the drums, 'cause now I know, I know,

I am loved, I am loved,
What a wonderful thing, what a beautiful thing,
What a glorious thing to be able to say.
What a wonderful thing, what a beautiful thing,
What a glorious thing, I am loved.
