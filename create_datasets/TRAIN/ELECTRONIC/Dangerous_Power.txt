You lost the soul
You're out of control
Your demon siding with you
No sense to your vice
In plastic you hide
I tried, and I failed to teach you

Like a flower I want to be
The sun that you grow to
I long to change you

Open your mind
The loss you don't find
The strength designed to reach you
Destruction finds
The weak and the blind
It tears you up, and it eats you

Like a flower I want to be
The sun that you grow to
Dangerous power between you and me
How I long to change you

Failure comes as passion goes
Too much time has slipped away
All I see anymore is history

Like a flower I want to be
The sun that you grow to
I long to change you

Like a flower I want to be
The one that you grow to

Like a flower I want to be
The one that you grow to
Dangerous power between you and me
How I long to save you
