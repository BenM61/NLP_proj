Oh, have you ever been lied to?
Maybe mistreated
Taken for granted
'Til you just can't stand it?
Were you ever mistaken?
Thought to be someone
That you just can't be?
So, where's the love you need?

(Love takes time
Please be kind
See every part of me)
Cause I want to be loved!
(Love ain't blind
Ties that bind
Take on eternity)

Oh, would you like to be trusted
Well, for once in your life?
Carry that fire
Without burnin' each other
Are you easily angry
Oh, can you bury your pride
Could you ever forgive me
And not keep it inside??

(Love takes time
Please be kind
See every part of me)
Cause I want to be loved!
(Love ain't blind
Ties that bind
Take on eternity)
Cause I want to be loved!
(Love takes time
Please be kind
See every part of me)
Oh, yeah!
(Love ain't blind
Ties that bind
Take on eternity)

Hey! make a sacrifice sometimes
Maybe more than you planned
Don't you hate to go through
The pain it takes to make a stand
A hardened heart or a heartache
To admit that you're wrong
And though it's hard
It hardly matters if that love is gone
Make a sacrifice sometimes!

(Love takes time
Please be kind
See every part of me)
Cause I want to be loved!
(Love ain't blind
Ties that bind
Take on eternity, on eternity)
(Love takes time
Please be kind
See every part of me, every part of me)
(Love ain't blind
Ties that bind
Take on eternity, on eternity
Love takes time
Please be kind)
Please be kind!
(See every part of me)
