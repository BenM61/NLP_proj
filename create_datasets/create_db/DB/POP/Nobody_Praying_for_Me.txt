I'm a whisper lost upon wind
I'm the ember that'll burn you down
I'm the water that'll drown you
I'm a star that's just a black hole now
I'm a terrifying danger
I'm a fruit decaying on the ground
I'm a swallower of anger
I'm the tree that falls that makes no sound
I make no sound

'Cause if I stand up, I break my bones
Everybody loves to see it fall unfold
Ain't nobody giving up
Cause nobody gives a f*ck
Stand up, and break my bones
Everybody wants what they just can't hold
There's nobody praying for me

I am fungus in the forest
I'm a lizard with a poisoned tongue
I'm the child in the manger
I'm the one who sacrificed his son
Rust is showing on my armor
I am lazing like an old man done
I'm a product of my anger
I'm the bullet in a loaded gun

Stand up, I break my bones
Everybody loves to see it fall unfold
Ain't nobody giving up
'Cause nobody gives a f*ck
Stand up, and break my bones
Everybody wants what they just can't hold
There's nobody praying for me

If I stand up, I break my bones
Everybody loves to see it fall unfold
Ain't nobody giving up
'Cause nobody gives a f*ck
Stand up, break my bones
Everybody wants what they just can't hold
There's nobody praying for me

(There's nobody praying for me)
There's nobody praying for me
