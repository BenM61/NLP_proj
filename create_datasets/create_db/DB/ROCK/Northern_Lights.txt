The northern lights are in my mind
They guide me back to you
The northern lights are in my eyes
They guide me back to you

Desination outward bound
I turn to see the northern lights behind the wing
Horizons seem to beckon me
Learned how to cry too young
So now I live to sing

The northern lights are in my mind
They guide me back to you
Horizons seem to beckon me
Learned how to cry too young
So now I live to sing

Though it's hard away from you
Travelling roads and just passing through
It's not for money and it's not for fame
I just can't explain, sometimes it's lonely

Marking the space between the days
Early hours pass away
I sing to you of northern lights
I sing for you of northern nights

Past or future, here or there
Shelter comes in words from you, so talk to me
I hear your voice, it comforts me
In morning dreams I take your hand
You walk with me

The northern lights are in my mind
They guide me back to you
Peace enfolds the still night air
Home again I look for you and find you there

Desintation homeward now
Take the easy way, bring me down
Making the hard way now I see
Hard to be really free, I'm missing you near me

Marking the space between the days
Early hours pass away
I sing to you of northern lights
I sing for you of northern nights

The northern lights are in my mind
They guide me back to you
The northern nights are in my eyes
They guide me back to you

The northern lights are in my mind
They guide me back to you
The northern lights are in my eyes
They guide me back to you

The northern lights are in my mind
They guide me back to you
The northern lights are in my eyes
They guide me back to you
