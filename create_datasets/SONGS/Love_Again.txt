All of your time alone
How long do ya think it will take?
Before you go round the bend
A permanent spiritual break
A broken heart on the mend
Somebody comin' just wait

Fate
Can be your best friend
And love
Is an accident of

Faith
Then in the end
Here is love
Come again

I had a girl I know
Love me more than life
She couldn't figure why
Confused to be precise
Finally let it go
I couldn't get enough of it right, right

Fate
Can be your best friend
And love
Is an accident of

Faith
Then in the end
Here is love
Come again

I'm with a woman now
Satisfied with me must be
Crazy about her yeah
I think maybe I got lucky
Watchin' what we are growin'
Ain't it amazing she really loves me

Fate
Can be your best friend
And love
Is an accident of

Faith
Then in the end
Here is love
Come again
