Tell me what do you see
When you looking at me
(Whoa)
Who I'm mission to be
What I'm destined to be
(Whoa)
I done been through the pain and the sorrow
The struggle is nothing but love (nothing but love)
I'm a soldier, a rider, a ghetto survivor
And all the above

All the above

All the above

All the above

All the above

All the above

All the above

All the above

Listen
Really what do you see
When you looking at me?
See me come up from nothing,
To me living my dreams
I done been to the bottom,
I done suffered a lot,
I deserve to be rich,
Headed straight to the top
Look how I ride for the block,
Look how I rep for the hood,
I get nothing but love now
When I come through the hood
Getting this fortune and fame
Money ain't going to shame
The new Benz is all white,
Call it John McCain
How the hell could you stop me?
Why in the world would you try?
I go hard forever,
That's just how I'm designed,
That's just how I was built
See the look in my eyes?
You take all of this from me,
And I'm still gon' survive
You get truth from me,
But these rappers gon' lie
I'm a part of these streets
Till the day that I die
I wave hi to the haters,
Mad that I finally done made it
Take a look and you can tell
That I'm destined for greatness

Tell me what do you see
When you looking at me
(Whoa)
Who I'm mission to be
What I'm destined to be
(Whoa)
I done been through the pain and the sorrow
The struggle is nothing but love (nothing but love)
I'm a soldier, a rider, a ghetto survivor
And all the above

All the above

All the above

All the above

All the above

All the above

All the above

All the above

It's easy to hate,
It's harder to love me
Y'all don't understand,
Y'all quickly to judge me
Put your foot in my Nikes,
Picture you livin' my life,
Picture you stuck in a cell,
Picture you wasting your life,
Picture you facing a charge,
Picture you beating the odds,
Picture you willing to bleed,
Picture you wearing the scar
Thank you for making me struggle,
Thank you for making me grind
I perfected my hustle,
Tell me the world ain't mine
You've been seein' me lately,
I'm a miracle baby
I refuse to lose
This what the ghetto done made me
I put that on my father
Tryna hope for tomorrow
When I think that I can't,
I envision Obama,
I envision the diamonds,
I envision Ferraris
If the world was perfect,
All my niggas behind me
Ain't you happy I made it?
That I'm making a statement?
Take a look and you can tell
That I'm destined for greatness

Tell me what do you see
When you looking at me
(Whoa)
Who I'm mission to be
What I'm destined to be
(Whoa)
I done been through the pain and the sorrow
The struggle is nothing but love (nothing but love)
I'm a soldier, a rider, a ghetto survivor
And all the above

Now up on the spot (spot)
All the way from out on the block (block)
I hustle hard cause it's all the same
And you know that crime don't stop
Just 'cause I rose to the top
And everybody knows my name
Still grindin' (still grindin')
Still hustlin' (still hustlin')
No more pain (no more pain),
No more sufferin (no more sufferin)
To my ladies and my shorties and my thugs,
And the dancing starting to love

All the above

All the above

All the above

All the above

All the above

All the above

All the above

Tell me what do you see
When you looking at me
(Whoa)
Who I'm mission to be
What I'm destined to be
(Whoa)
I done been through the pain and the sorrow
The struggle is nothing but love (nothing but love)
I'm a soldier, a rider, a ghetto survivor
And all the above
