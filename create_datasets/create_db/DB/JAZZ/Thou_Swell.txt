Thou swell, thou witty
Thou sweet, thou grand
Wouldst kiss me pretty
Wouldst hold my hand

Both thine eyes are cute too
What they do to me?
Hear me holler I choose
A sweet Lollapalooza in thee

I'd feel so rich
In a hut for two
Two rooms and kitchen
I'm sure would do

Give me just a plot of
Not a lot of land
And thou swell, thou witty
Thou grand

Thou swell, thou witty
Thou sweet, thou grand
Wouldst kiss me pretty
Wouldst hold my hand

Both thine eyes are cute too
What they do to me?
Hear me holler I choose
A sweet Lollapalooza in thee

I'd feel so rich
In a hut for two
Two rooms and kitchen
I'm sure would do

Give me just a plot of
Not a lot of land
And thou swell, thou witty
Thou grand
