Are you ready? 

Picked up my paper today 
Give you one guess what they say 
Now we got to learn how to play 
Interactive 

Another cross in need of a road 
Another loop in need of a hole 
Another body in need of a soul 
Interactive 

Ain't that a bitch? 

Tell me what to do and I'll do it 
I don't care just as long as we get to it 
Up and down, around and all through it 
Baby, baby, baby, let's do it 
Interactive 

Everything you got is so hot (Interactive) 
Bend me over what choice I got (Interactive) 
Neck and neck with you I am not 
Interactive 

Ahh, hey there baby, hook me up into your box 
No no, I don't need the keys to the lock 
Call me outta of luck laughin' stock 
Interactive 

Oh, ain't that a bitch? 

Tell me what to do and I'll do it 
I don't care just as long as we get to it 
Up and down, around and all through it 
Baby, baby, baby, let's do it 
Interactive 
(As long as we get to it, to it, to it) 

Yeah, yeah 

I work twice as hard (Interactive, interactive) 
To follow you no matter how far 
To you I'm probably worth no more than the strings on this guitar 
Ain't that a bitch? 

Ow! 
Interactive 
Oh, oh 
One more, one more
