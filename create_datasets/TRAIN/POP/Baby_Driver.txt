My daddy was the family bassman
My mamma was an engineer
And I was born one dark gray morn
With music coming in my ears
In my ears

They call me Baby Driver
And once upon a pair of wheels
I hit the road and I'm gone
What's my number
I wonder how your engines feel
Ba ba ba ba
Scoot down the road
What's my number
I wonder how your engines feel
Shine a light, ooo ooo oo, ooo ooo oo

My daddy was a prominent frogman
My mamma's in the Naval reserve
When I was young I carried a gun
But I never got the chance to serve
I did not serve

They call me Baby Driver
And once upon a pair of wheels
I hit the road and I'm gone
What's my number
I wonder how your engines feel
Ba ba ba ba
Scoot down the road
What's my number
I wonder how your engines feel

Ba ba ba ba, mmm ba ba ba ba

My daddy got a big promotion
My mamma got a raise in pay
There's no one home, we're all alone
Oh come into my room and play
Yes we can play

I'm not talking about your pigtails
But I'm talking 'bout your sex appeal
I hit the road and I'm gone
What's my number

I wonder how your engines feel
Ba ba ba ba
Scoot down the road
What's my number
I wonder how your engines feel

To oo ooo to oo ooo to oo ooo oo ooo oo ooo oo ooo
