It's complicated
Technically I'm certified
A walking declaration
Of everything I couldn't get right
Time is just an anchor
But seven years I think I'm right
Now you've changed your number
It's like a noose around my life

Every pill I took in vain
Every meal for you I made
Every penny I put away

Asking for flowers
Is like asking you to be nice
Don't tell me you're too tired
Ten years I've been working nights

My life is like a picture left
Out too long in the sun
Now I'm trying to remember all
The faces of the names I've loved
And all that's left of me now is
A cigarette burning bright
And a fading memory of all the things
I tried to get right

Every pill I took in vain
Every meal for you I made
Every penny I put away

Asking for flowers
Is like asking you to be nice
Don't tell me you're too tired
10 years I've been working nights

Every pill I took in vain
Every meal for you I made
Every bill I went and paid
Every card I signed my name
Every time I poured my heart out
Every threat you made to move out
Every cruel word you let just slip out
Every cruel word you let just slip out
