And then the same thing comes from us
And then the same thing comes from us

Old have memories to keep the cold away
What is that you say?
No sense to dwell
Old, are you ridiculed and turned away?
No attention paid?
I thought as much
Yes and the dumb patriots have their say
Only see their way
Nothing to sell

And bad from us, so obvious
Preposterous, when you think
Of the time that each has spent
Words heaven sent and truly meant to show (ooh)

Old, may I sit down here and learn today?
I'll hear all you say
I won't go away
And bad from us, so obvious
Preposterous, when you think
Of the time that each has spent
Words heaven sent and truly meant to show (ooh)

Preposterous
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo
Preposterous
