Can't sleep, cause everything's changing
You don't want to leave things behind
Can't breathe, there's too many things
Going on, going wrong in your life

Tears in your eyes
Sweet goodbyes

I know how you feel right now
Losing dreams you've come to care about
I know what you need right now
You need to come on home so I can hold you tight

Get you through the night
I'll get you through the night

Wake up, the sun's shining bright
Let's go out of bed, into the light
Shape up, we won't forget
Still there's lot's of love left to hold tight

Tears in your eyes
Sweet goodbyes

I know how you feel right now
Losing dreams you've come to care about
I know what you need right now
You need to come on home so I can hold you tight
Get you through the night

Everything of love between us
Will get us trough the night
All the things we've lost will teach us
See the pretty things in life
All the places that we've been to
The people we relate to
All the love that we give in to

Blow the tears from our eyes
Sweet goodbyes

I know how you feel right now
Losing dreams you've come to care about
I know what you need right now
You need to come on home so I can hold you tight

I know how you feel right now
Losing dreams you've come to care about
I know what you need right now
You need to come on home so I can hold you tight

I'll get you through the night
