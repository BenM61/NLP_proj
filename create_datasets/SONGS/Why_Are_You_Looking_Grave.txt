Why are you looking grave?
Are you thinking of something to say?
Why are you sitting there?
Are you hoping that someone will stare?

Your mouth is hiding
You've got smiling eyes

Why are you looking grave?
Are you thinking of something to say?
Be I thinking of you?

Your mouth is hiding
You've got smiling eyes
Softly dividing
What they see in your face
From what you feel like inside

Who are all those who greet me?
Does it matter if I know?

Your mouth is hiding
You've got joyless eyes
Softly contriving
All the terrible things
That shook up our hearts enough
