Three feet tall
With a head like a bowling ball
Can't get up from where you fall
D'you bring this back to me?

What's it for?
Stood in the clothes that you once wore
Stood up from the night before
D'you drink and never leave?

Take my hand across the sand and lead me out to sea
Heaven sent the money we spent, give it back to me

Loneliness
It's got your name and your new address
When it walks in the place is a mess
And it drinks and never leaves

What's it for?
Stood in the clothes that you once wore
Stood up from the night before
Do you dream and never sleep?

Heaven sent the money we spent, give it back to me
Take my hand across the sand and lead me out to sea

Take my hand across the sand and lead me out to sea
Heaven sent the money we spent, give it back to me

Fortune favors
Money takers
Get a sound and see
Sounds demental
Fashion central
Give it back to me
