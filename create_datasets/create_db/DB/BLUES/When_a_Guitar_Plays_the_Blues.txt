You know, you get the strangest feelin'
Yeah, when a guitar plays the blues
You know, you get the strangest little feelin'
Yeah, when a guitar plays the blues

You know, your body gets a message
Yeah, your soul has got to move

You know, you might even bat your eye
Yeah, you might even snatch or cry
Yeah, the feelin' you're feelin' within you
Well, you know, you just can't hide

You got to bend it like that
You kinda squeeze it like this
And it reaches down inside you
Yeah, your soul let just can't resist

'Cause you get the strangest kinda feelin'
Yeah, when that guitar plays the blues
You know, your body gets a message
Yeah, your soul, your soul
Your soul has got to move

And when the music's over
It's time to turn out the lights
You know the blues goes home with ya
Yeah, that soothes you through the night

You get the strange kinda feelin'
Yeah, when that guitar plays the blues
You know, your body gets the message
And your soul, your soul, your soul
Your soul has got to move
