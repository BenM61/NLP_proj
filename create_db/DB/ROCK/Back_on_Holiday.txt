It's quarter to nine
So tired I can barely move
No one's at work on time
I'll be there in an hour or two.
Five days a week is absurd
A few days off in his crazy world
Is something I could use
I'm going -

Isn't it time we had a vacation?
Back on holiday
Need a little rest and relaxation!
Pick up the phone
Tell the boss I'm not coming in
I'm busy taking it slow
No time to waste in a traffic jam.
Morning
Noon and night I think I've paid my dues
Pack my bags and I'm ready to make my getaway
I'm going -
Back on holiday
Isn't it time we had a vacation?...
You know that sometimes life can turn into all work and no play
So if you feel like you need it just go back on holiday.
Five days a week is absurd
A few days off in this crazy world
Is something I could use
