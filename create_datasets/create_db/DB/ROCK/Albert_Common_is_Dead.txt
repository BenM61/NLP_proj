At evening time when work is through
You change yourself to someone new
You try to run to get away
From the pressures of your day.

So you run
Fast as you can
Swear
You're a different man
Tell them
Albert Common is dead.

Your job is big, your pay is small
Your income tax takes it all
You'll get your watch in one more year
Will anyone remember you were ever here?

So you run
As fast as you can
Swear
That you're a different man
Tell them
Albert common is dead.
(Repeat in slow shuffle tempo)
