Too many times you've crossed the line
Don't you come crawling back to me
Say we can be friends, it's not the end
Trying to fix it with sorry

You cheated, you lied, you made me cry
Left me alone with no affection
Now look at you, broke, I hope you choke
On all your tears and all your tension

He'll take your heart
(He'll take your heart, he'll take your heart)
Destroy each and every part
(Each and every part)
Leave you cold layin' in the dark
'Cause he' dangerous
That man he's dangerous

Teardrops come again
I can almost feel your pain
I never ever thought the day would come
When I would be the lucky one

To see you hurt, to see you cry
Gives my soul a natural high
Think about the times you walked on me
The teardrops came to set me free

You seem to bring the pain, no more to gain
I'm out this situation
You were the rock to hold me down
You were the cause of my frustration

Now I see you cry, you wipe your eyes
You promised me you've changed
But in the end you're still the same
How can a player change his game?

He'll take your heart
(He'll take your heart, he'll take your heart)
Destroy each and every part
(Each and every part)
Leave you cold layin' in the dark
'Cause he's dangerous
And then he's dangerous

Teardrops come again
I can almost feel your pain
I never ever thought the day would come
When I would be the lucky one

To see you hurt, to see you cry
Gives my soul a natural high
Think about the times you walked on me
The teardrops came to set me free

He's in your mind, he's a shadow in the night
In his eyes there is no light
'Cause he's dangerous
That man he's dangerous

Teardrops come again
I can almost feel your pain
I never ever thought the day would come
When I would be the lucky one

To see you hurt, to see you cry
Gives my soul a natural high
Think about the times you walked on me
The teardrops came to set me free

Teardrops come again
I can almost feel your pain
I never ever thought the day would come
When I would be the lucky one

To see you hurt, to see you cry
Gives my soul a natural high
Think about the times you walked on me
The teardrops came to set me free
