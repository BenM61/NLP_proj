Heart to heart, now we're alone
And I just got to let you know
There is so much I've been holding in
Afraid that you won't understand
Afraid that you don't feel the same way too

'Cause I've always wondered
What I look like through your eyes
If you'll ever reach to find the love
I have inside, then you would see
You make my life complete
You are the better part of me

Time to time, the heart sees clear
I have no doubts I have no fear
'Cause when I look at you I see
Everything I want to be
It's you that makes my world a brighter place

And I've always wondered
What I looked like through your eyes
Have you ever reached
To find the love I have inside

If you see the same things
That I've seen, it's through my eyes
Then you would see you make my life complete
You are the better part of me
