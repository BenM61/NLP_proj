Oh yeah I told you I was trouble when we first met
But i, guess you never got the message, huh
I hate to be so goddamn depressive
But my broken heart turned me to a savage, ooh

'Cause I only want you, when I'm lonely
On a late night, on a friday, with some high-grade
Said I only want you, when I'm lonely
On a late night, on a friday, with some high-grade

You're wanting somethin' real
I don't care what you feel, not now
You're makin' a big deal
Of nothing, you should chill out
Don't say you were misled
You heard me when I said, not now
You're makin' a big deal
Of nothing, you should chill out

I know you thought that me and you were onto somethin'
But i, had no plans of lovin' you
So call me whatever you want
And you can tell everyone, that I'm a fool
After you knew, just come through

'Cause I only want you, when I'm lonely
On a late night, on a friday, with some high-grade
Said I only want you, when I'm lonely
On a late night, on a friday, with some high-grade

You're wanting somethin' real
I don't care what you feel, not now
You're makin' a big deal
Of nothing, you should chill out
Don't say you were misled
You heard me when I said, not now
You're makin' a big deal
Of nothing, you should chill out

So what the hell are you talkin' bout
I told you what it was before I let your crazy ass in my house
And now you callin' up your niggas and runnin' your mouth
And indirectin' on the twitter, you're buggin' out
Remember you were givin' women the run around
So call it karma, 'cause it's your turn, it's comin' around
And if you still don't understand, let me br-br-break it down
Ain't got no time 'cause I been makin' them dollars and pounds

I know, it hurts your ego
To know, that I let you go
I don't, want you anymore

But you know that I'm busy
