Goodnight, sleep tight, big bright sun has gone away
Ya know it's gone away
Good bye, don't cry, tomorrow bring us a brand new day
We can run away
And they'll laugh up and down the hall
Don't go shout when you hear them fall
Let them fly right across the wall
Let them cry till the morning call

Little angel dance
Little angel dance

Big night, bright lights, time now to lay them under arrest
Put 'em under arrest
Bad guys, mean eye, all gone away to where they belong
Let's just sing our song
And they'll laugh up and down the hall
Don't go shout when you hear them fall
Let them fly right across the wall
Let them cry till the morning call

Little angel dance
Little angel dance
Little angel dance

Goodnight, sleep tight, big bright sun has gone away
It's gone away
Good bye, don't cry, tomorrow bring us the brand new day
We can run away
And they'll laugh up and down the hall
Don't go shout when you hear them fall
Let them fly right across the wall
Let them cry till the morning calls

Ah little angel dance uh
Little angel dance uh uh uh uh uh
Little angel dance ooh
C'mon c'mon c'mon and dance
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ooh dance
