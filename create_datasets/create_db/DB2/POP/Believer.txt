There must be something in the air
That I'm not breathing, I'm not receiving
Something I must be unaware
I got a feeling

I am just a jaded girl
I feel unlovable
I need to blind my faith
It's gonna take a lot to find my way to believer, yeah

So put your hands on my body
Like there's something you can show me
Put your hands on my body
Honey, I got faith in nothing, oh
But if you love me right
Then baby you just might make a believer out of me
So put your hands on my body
Like there's something you can show me
Put your hands on my body
Honey, I got faith in nothing, oh
But if you love me right
Then baby you just might make a believer out of me

Secret codes written on the wall
Can't understand it, can't comprehend it
A touch that is invisible
I got a feeling

I am just a jaded girl
I feel unlovable
I need to blind my faith
It's gonna take a lot to find my way to believer, yeah

So put your hands on my body
Like there's something you can show me
Put your hands on my body
Honey, I got faith in nothing, oh
But if you love me right
Then baby you just might make a believer out of me
So put your hands on my body
Like there's something you can show me
Put your hands on my body
Honey, I got faith in nothing, oh
But if you love me right
Then baby you just might make a believer out of me

But your hands on my body
Like there's something you can show me
Put your hands on my body, I got faith in nothing, oh
If you love me right
Then baby you just might make a believer out of me

So put your hands on my body
Like there's something you can show me
Put your hands on my body
Honey, I got faith in nothing, oh
