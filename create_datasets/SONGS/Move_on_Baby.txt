Take the chance 
Give it all that you can 
'Cause he doesn't feel a thing for you 
You can try to move on 
So nothing will go wrong 
Maybe he will be back 
To search for you 

Back on track 
It's me yeah, and I fixed it 
I proved my point, now we mix it 
Yeah the A double L star, fresh and I got together 
To make the track flow better 
That's why we stand strong, now you know what's up 
If I'm on the move
I can't stop 
The beat is simple, but you can't refuse it
That's why I love music 

Move on baby 
Move on baby 
Move on baby 
And we get together 

Again and again I keep going with the swing 
I stay funky like this and I bring 
Beats to move you
So I can prove you 
That I can rock a microphone like I used to 
I love music yeah, can you feel it 
Check me out 
This is how I deal it 
The bass, the mid, the treble 
I just fuse it together 
'Cause I love music
