I got so fucking romantic
I apologize
Lemme light your cigarette
Come visit Kansas for a week of debauchery
Songs and high fives and weird sex

Cute thing
Don't be rude, thing
Hot thing
It was nothing

Oh god
Give me Frank Ocean's voice
And James Brown's stage presence
I will be your rock god when you're rolling the dice

I got so fucking romantic
I apologize
Lemme smoke your weed, no wait
Healthy minds make sexy bodies
Let us touch so much of ourselves together

Cute thing
Don't be rude, thing
Hot thing
It was nothing

Dog
Give me one little chance
I can make you a man
I will be your rock dog when you're rolling your eyes

Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do

He died in an explosion
Of mixed media and poorly written reviews
And some stammering drunk who tried to tell him how good his shit was
That's, that's some good shit, man
I accidentally spoke your first name aloud
Trying to make it fit in the lyrics of "Ana Ng," worked like a charm
We're getting old
When will we walk in each other's majestic presence?
Listen, hear my words
They're the ones you would think I would say if I was John Linnell
Or trying to be John Linnell

I am loved
I am loved
I would sleep naked
Next to you naked
I am loved
I am loved
I would sleep naked
Next to you naked
I am loved
I am loved
Like some excommunicated priest
Casting demons
Asked one what its name was
