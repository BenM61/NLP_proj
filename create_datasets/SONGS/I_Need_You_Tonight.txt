When the music stops,
I walk you to your door
And we say goodnight,
Like a thousand times before

This is the night (night),
I just can't walk away, oh
This is the night,
I need you even more

Why should we wait 'til tomorrow? oh, oh
Why should we wait 'til tomorrow? oh, oh
I can't wait til' tomorrow oh
I need you tonight

I drive away, but you're still on my mind
It's gettin' so hard leavin' you behind
This is the night I just want you to know, oh
This is the night I just can't let you go

Why should we wait 'til tomorrow? oh, oh
Why should we wait 'til tomorrow? oh, oh
I can't wait til' tomorrow oh
I need you tonight

Yeah!

Oh!

Why should we wait 'til tomorrow? oh, oh
Why should we wait 'til tomorrow? oh, oh
I can't wait til' tomorrow oh
I need you tonight

And I need you tonight
'Cause I need you tonight
