You won't count to seven it's usually 'til ten. 
To hell with Sydney girls you're much better than them. 
On my mattress I've been drawing a line, where I'll shut my eyes and where you should lie, 
you should lie, if you should lie. 
I'll be a lighter of fires, you be the

Fighter of fires, I'll be the fighter of fires, you be the lighter fires. 
Should I choose to stay here now all depends, 
on buildings, buses, streets, trees, rain and friends on my mattress 
I've been drawing a line, where I'll shut my eyes and where you should lie, 

If you should lie. 
I'll be a lighter of fires you'll be a fighter of fires, 
I'll be a fighter of fires you be a lighter of fires.
