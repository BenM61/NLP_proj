She fell in love with my singing
She knew the bells started ringing
She thought there was only her there
But, me, I just live for the clapping
A hand delivery of an invite to my premiere
When he fell in love, I was acting
I sent her flowers, asked her to marry me
But all I heard was their clapping
Now she cries with a cigarrette at the window
He croons and moans like he's hurting
She cries so well
He croons and moans, just croons and moans
Now, I never thought [i had no idea] she needed direction
And he was at the mercy of his writers
For the songs I needed [for me] to touch her
Those sad, sad songs to make me happy
Now she cries with a cigarrette at the window
He croons and moans like he's hurting
She cries so well
He croons and moans, just croons and moans
We re-enact the love scenes from her/my movies
But I never thought, but she uses a stand-in
His voice is croakier every day now
And she cries so well
