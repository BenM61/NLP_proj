She's my silicone sensation
She's my secret transformation
My sex creation built to bid the cry
Frankenstein Frankenstein
Beware of the imitation
All I want is easy action Frankenstein
She's a soft-eyed Cinderella
She's the beastie Barbarella
Tell her she's a gift from Frankenstein
* Hey hey Frankenstein
Hey hey Frankenstein
Hey hey thank you Frankenstein
And if I asked you
And if I asked you
Is she half as twice as nice as Frankenstein
* Repeat
Like a Mona Lisa
A sex changed Amnesia
Scrooge, I wanna be my Frankenstein
* Repeat
Hey hey
** Frankenstein Frankenstein
God I wish that you were mine
The backstage never looked so so divine
** Repeat
* Repeat
Hey hey Frankenstein
Hey hey Frankenstein
Shoo, shake
And sending shivers down my spine
Hey hey Frankenstein
What's waiting I haven't got the time
