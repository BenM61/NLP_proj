Broken trust makes a jealous heart
Injured love slowly falls apart
Say goodbye 'cause love can't rise
Above the lies of a broken trust

Young love is such a special thing
It spoils the heart for less
But sure as time, all things must change
Not always for the best

With wicked ease, temptation breeds
A strong and binding spell
But the honeymoon is over when
You're out with someone else

'Cause a broken trust makes a jealous heart
Injured love slowly falls apart
Say goodbye 'cause love can't rise
Above the lies of a broken trust

This world is full of hungry eyes
But they can't turn your head
If you place the one you cherish
Far above the rest

For wild desires of careless fires
Where everyone gets burned
Just look at me and you will see
A lesson too late learned

Broken trust makes a jealous heart
Injured love slowly falls apart
Say goodbye 'cause love can't rise
Above the lies of a broken trust
Above the lies of a broken trust
