My stomach stay flat baby mothers don't like me, huh
Chicks this heated then I give 'em my ice see
I'm the knockout queen y'all hoes don't want to fight me
Sexy, brown skin complexion
Concealed in my purse its a deadly weapon yeah

I even get free dutches at the corner store
Shot caller dudes stop as soon as I speak
Babs Bunny the black jet queen of the week huh
I'm fire just what the thugs desire
Got a high pitched flow MC Mariah
When I walk down the streets niggaz squeak their tires
Got every club promoter passin me flyers
I'm in there V.I.P. a sure night
With a bottle of haze my weave is so tight
I'm ready for some action hands in the air
Crystal over here in the club no beer
Stuntin bad girl I do it for nothin
Tight dickies shirt with a pop top button
Babs repeat it I'm something that the rap game needed
Thorough bread plus I stay weeded

You know its Freddy p the hit man of the band

I'm in and out them magazines back to the TV shows
Attendin business meetings with a 40s and my dirty flows
Everydays an episode all because them episodes
Just like rats they want to know where my cheddar flows
Everyday like valentine
How I keep it rollin
Never made a dime from rap?..yet
I thank them people no my people don't believe it though
Someone has been leavin those words sayin cold
You think I don't know you serving coke
'cause you ain't a dude alive that couldn't carry their coke
So it must be them freakin po pos I hope
They better pray they don't run up wrong
Or your momma gonna be singin that song

Puffin on sour deezys you know it ain't illegal
And I never been to Iraq but packin desert eagles I mean
Call me a liar but the fires back
Bad boy empire is where the fires at

The whole hood on fire the wires tapped
Ok this part of the deal
Bounty huntas all on my heels
Lookin for me huh somewhere in the Ville

Overseas passport to brazil
Survival of the fittest
Nigga I talk it I live it
Gotta crawl before you walk
Any nigga can get it
