Is it stinging
The acid in your stream
Hear the ringing
Voices in between

You picked this tune to play
And you've had to have your way
Got your masterpiece
But you don't seem pleased

So here it is, custom made
You wrapped the world around your finger
Did you take on an endless tower?
Has your spring turned into winter?

You're frozen cold
A one man show
But who is watching?
There's no one watching

No one watching
No one's watching
Oh, ooh, ooh
No, no

Now, you got it then
Everything you asked
Burned your bridges
So, why you turning back?

My doors won't fit you through
Your head's too heavy to
What could I give you now?
I'm still the same tale

So here it is, custom made
You wrapped the world around your finger
Was it all a big mistake?
Has your spring turned into winter?

You're in control
A one man show
But who is watching?
There's no one watching

So here it is, custom made
You wrapped the world around your finger
You're claim to fame turned out a shame
Has your spring turned into winter?

You held your own
One man show
But no one's watching
No, no one's watching

But no one's watching
No, no one's watching
But no one's watching
No, no one's watching

But no one's watching
No, no one's watching
But no one's watching
No, no one's watching

You can't go back
And you can't come back
And you can't go back
And you can't come back

And you can't go back
(But who is watching?)
And you can't come back
(There's no one watching)

And you can't go back
(But who is watching?)
And you can't come back
(There's no one watching)

But who is watching?
There's no one watching
But who is watching?
There's no one watching

(Watching)
No one watching
(Watching)
No one's watching

(Watching)
No one's watching
(Watching)

Oh, oh, ooh, oh
No, no, no
