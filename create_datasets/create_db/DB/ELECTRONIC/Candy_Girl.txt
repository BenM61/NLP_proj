My girls like candy, a candy treat
She knocks me hot up off me feet
She's so fine as can be
I know this girl is meant for me

Candy Girl
You are my world
You look so sweet
You're a special treat

Candy girl
All I want to say
When you're with me
You brighten up my day

All I know
When I'm with you
You make me feel so good
Through and through
The way you walk
And the way you talk
You always look so good
You make me forget my thoughts

Do you really love me? (do you really love me?)
Don't you really care? (don't you really care?)
Do you really need me? (do you really need me?)
And will you always be there?

Every night
And every day
I'm always thinking of you
In every way

All I know
When I'm with you
You make me feel so good
Through and through

Candy girl
You are my world
You're everything, everything
Everything to me

Candy girl
All I want to say
I need your love
Each and everyday

Hey fellas

Check out Mike & Bobby's little lady
Ooh eeh

What about Ronnie's?
She's bad, she's bad
I know she's bad

She walks so fast, she looks so sweet
She makes my heart just skip a beat
My girl's the best and that's no lie
She tells me that I'm her only guy
That might be true but my girl's a joy
She don't play around, she's right to the point
My girl's like candy, a candy treat
She knocks me hot up off my feat
