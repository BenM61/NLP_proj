let it all out 

when the sunshine hits your eyes you'll find me there
and i'm not afraid of romance
although you've just arrived to crash my life
your smile is saying something that i like
you're not afraid of romance
and i'm not afraid of romance 

don't be afraid
don't be afraid
don't be afraid
and i'm not afraid of romance

let it all out

when the sunshine hits your eyes you'll find me there
and i'm not afraid of romance
although you've just arrived to crash my life
your smile is saying something that i like
you're not afraid of romance
and i'm not afraid of romance 

don't be afraid
don't be afraid
don't be afraid
and i'm not afraid of romance

don't be afraid
don't be afraid
don't be afraid
i'm not afraid

when the sunshine hits your eyes you'll find me there
and i'm not afraid of romance
when the sunshine hits your eyes you'll find me there
and i'm not afraid of romance
when the sunshine hits your eyes you'll find me there
and i'm not afraid of romance
when the sunshine hits your eyes you'll find me there
and i'm not afraid of romance
