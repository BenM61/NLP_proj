All alone at the end of the evening and the bright lights have faded to blue
I was thinkin' about a woman who might have loved me and I never knew
You know I've always been a dreamer spent my life running round

And it's so hard to change can't seem to settle down
But the dreams I've seen lately
Keep on turnin' out and burnin' out and turnin' out the same
So put me on a highway and show me a sign and take it to the limit one more time

(Piano)

You can spend all your time making love you can spend all your love making time
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow would you still be mine
And when you're looking for more freedom when nobody seems to care
And you can't find the door well you can't find it anywhere

When there's nothin' to believe in
Still you're coming back you're running back
You're coming back for more
So put me on the highway and show me a sign and take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit take it to the limit take it to the limit one more time
