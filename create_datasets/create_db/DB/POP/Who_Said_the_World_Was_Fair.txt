If there's enough to go around why can't I get mine
If everybody knows they've been lied to
If everybody knows it, then why are they waiting
On a gas line
I think it must be a test to weed the best from the rest
But whatever they are doing is driving us
Out of our minds
Driving us out of our minds
But we always take it 'cause

Who said the world was fair
Or that we should care
What a way of thinking

The sun is free enough
It's shining there, shining there out of our reach
But if they can, they'll find a way
To make us pay for what we get
When we lay out on the beach
