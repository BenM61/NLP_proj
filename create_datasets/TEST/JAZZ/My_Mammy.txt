Everything is lovely
When you start to roam;
The birds are singin', the day that you stray,
But later, when you are further away,
Things won't seem so lovely
When you're all alone;
Here's what you'll keep saying
When you're far from home:

Mammy,
Mammy,
The sun shines east, the sun shines west,
I know where the sun shines best
Mammy,
My little mammy,
My heartstrings are tangled around Alabammy.
I'm comin',
Sorry that I made you wait.
I'm comin',
Hope and trust that I'm not late, oh oh oh
Mammy,
My little Mammy,
I'd walk a million miles
For one of your smiles,
My Mammy! Oh oh oh

Mammy
My little Mammy.
The sun shines east, the sun shines west,
I know where, the sun shines best!
It's on my Mammy I'm talkin' about, nobody else's!
My little Mammy,
My heartstrings are tangled around Alabammy.
Mammy, Mammy, I'm comin',
I'm so sorry that I made you wait!
Mammy, Mammy, I'm comin'!
Oh God, I hope I'm not late!
Look at me, Mammy! Don't you know me?
I'm your little baby!
I'd walk a million miles
For one of your smiles,
My Mammy!
