A broken heart4s a bird without wings to fly
With all your might it can4t be denied
A broken heart4s the darkest hour before the dawn
Why is it you4re left lonely to the core

If I had to try my best to remember when
A time with no memory of you
I4d close my eyes and try hard to pretend
This heart4s been broken once before

So torn apart so many words unspoken
It must learn this hurt will end
So if a tear should fall don4t wonder why
Form now on it4s forever you

A broken heart can feel no desire
It leaves you weak - all that remains
Is a broken heart like a river that won4t flow
You4d never do that to me - I know

A broken heart can heal if given time
A broken heart
Needs all the strength you4ve got inside
A broken heart
Has no safe place to hide
A broken heart
So sure the world won4t be the same

A broken heart can feel no desire
It leaves you weak - all that remains
Is a broken heart like a river that won4t flow
You4d never do that to me - I know

A broken heart can feel no desire
It leaves you weak - all that remeins
Is a broken heart like a river that won4t flow
You4d never do that to me - I know

A broken heart (this broken this broken heart)
A broken heart (this broken this broken heart)
This broken heart (you rescued me from)
A broken heart
