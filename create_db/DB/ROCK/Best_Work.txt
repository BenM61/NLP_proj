After the fall things will never be the same
How in the world can anyone love again?

Some of my best work was you 
I wish you were here right now
But I still don't want to know if you're moving on

I never dreamed about you
When we were never far apart
And now that I'm without you
You're here all through the night

Some of my best work was you
I wish you were here right now
I would ride the ups and downs
Be a man and get my feet back on the ground
Some of my best work
Some of my best work
My best work was you
But I still don't want to know if you're moving on

There's no lovers up above
No lovers only love
