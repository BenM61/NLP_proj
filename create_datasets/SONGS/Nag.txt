(A. Crier)

Woe baby you're a nag (Nag nag naggity nag)
You're a nag (Nag nag naggity nag)
You're a nag (Nag nag naggity nag)
You're a nag (Nag nag naggity nag)
Would you go do this, and go do that, nag

(Nag) You're always tellin' me what to do
(Nag) I just can't seem to get rid of you
(You're a nag) You order me around just like a slave
(Nag) You're gonna send me to an early grave
Would you go fix the bacon and don't burn the toast
Run down to the butcher shop and buy me a roast

(Nag) The way you're naggin' never gonna stop
(Nag) You always seem to be a blowin' your top
(You're a nag) One of these days I'm gonna lose my mind
(Nag) Jump out a window and I'll be real fine
Would you go do this, go do that
Wash up all the dishes
And don't you talk back

When I met you you were oh so sweet
Now you give me the bread and you take all the meat
You're always screamin' and hollerin' loud
I'm gonna buy me a ticket to the nearest cloud

You're a nag (Nag nag naggity nag)
You're a nag (Nag nag naggity nag)
You're a nag (Nag nag naggity nag)
You're a nag (Nag nag naggity nag)
Would you go do this, and go do that, nag

Hey you, get out of here

When I met you you were oh so sweet
Now you give me the bread and you take all the meat
You're always screamin' and hollerin' loud
I'm gonna buy me a ticket to the nearest cloud

You're a nag (Nag nag naggity nag)
You're a nag (Nag nag naggity nag)
You're a nag (Nag nag naggity nag)
You're a nag (Nag nag naggity nag)
Would you go do this, and go do that, nag

I hate you, get out of here
