I'd live and die for love alone
I'll pull the sword out of the stone
My golden hair, the silver moon
Night will be returning soon

Wouldn't it be good if we could rule together?
Love the way we should, castles
I've been hoping for something to last instead of falling down
Falling down

(Oh, oh oh oh)
(Oh, oh oh oh)
(Oh, oh oh oh)
Castles
(Oh, oh oh oh)
(Oh, oh oh oh)
(On and on)

Once upon a time and far away
I raised the gates and let you stay
I was building walls to keep from breaking
What kept you out now keeps you safe

Wouldn't it be good if we could rule together?
Love the way we should, castles
I've been hoping for something to last instead of falling down
Holding down

(Oh, oh oh oh)
(Oh, oh oh oh)
(Oh, oh oh oh)
Castles
(Oh, oh oh oh)
(Oh, oh oh oh)
(On and on)

Now I can feel, I am free like forever
Heart strong as steel
And light as a feather

Wouldn't it be good if we could rule together?
Love the way we should, castles
I've been hoping for something to last instead of falling down
Holding down

(Oh, oh oh oh)
(Oh, oh oh oh)
(Oh, oh oh oh)
Castles
(Oh, oh oh oh)
(Oh, oh oh oh)
(On and on and on)

(Oh, oh oh oh) Castles
(Oh, oh oh oh)
(Oh, oh oh oh)
(On and on)

Castles, castles, castles, castles
