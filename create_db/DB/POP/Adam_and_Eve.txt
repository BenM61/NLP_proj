In the garden of Eden, a long time ago,
Yeah, there was a story I'm sure you will know.
I'm sure you remember, I know you believe,
The story of Adam and Eve.

In the garden of Eden where live began,
Yes the very beginning of woman and man.
I'm sure you remember and I know you believe,
The story of Adam and Eve.

They were in the garden while they both fell in love, 
Sheltered by the guiding hand of the one above.
Life was filled with happiness until one day around,
A very great temptation, you know how it goes.
