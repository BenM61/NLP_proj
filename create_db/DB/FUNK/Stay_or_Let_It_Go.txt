What's up girl?
I need to talk to you for a minute
I can't keep playing myself like this
There's only one thing I wanna know
Should I stay or should I go?

It's not my fault that you make yourself regret the past
But all I know is, it makes me look bad
When I'm holding your hand and you see your friends you know
And they walk away laughing
Calling me a fool

(But baby I can't) change the things you did before we met
Even though I didn't know you
(It's hard for me to) trust you even more girl, I love you
So tell me what am I to do, yeah

Don't know if we will last
Nothing we do can erase the past
Now can you tell me, I don't know
Should I stay or let it go?
Don't know if we're meant to be
And if we should be committed faithfully
But can you tell me, I don't know
Should I stay or let it go?

I think of the night that I made reservations just for two
But you gave your attention to someone across the room
I should have known right then that things weren't right
But I couldn't see it cause love had me so blind

(Tell me how can) I be so secure in loving you
When everybody's calling me a fool
(I can't keep holding) on to broken promises from you
And I can't take no more from you, yeah

Don't know if we will last
Nothing we do can erase the past
Now can you tell me, I don't know
Should I stay or let it go?
Don't know if we're meant to be
And if we should be committed faithfully
But can you tell me, I don't know
Should I stay or let it go?

Baby time and time again
I try to overlook the pain
And I think of losing all we had together
Girl if it takes me losing you
For happiness in me
I think that I might just have to let you go, oh

Why you playing those games huh?
I don't see how you'll do it when I walk out the door

Don't know if we will last
Nothing we do can erase the past
Now can you tell me, I don't know
Should I stay or let it go?
Don't know if we're meant to be
And if we should be committed faithfully
But can you tell me, I don't know
Should I stay or let it go?

Don't know if we will last
Nothing we do can erase the past
Now can you tell me, I don't know
Should I stay or let it go?
Don't know if we're meant to be
And if we should be committed faithfully
But can you tell me, I don't know
Should I stay or let it go?

Should I stay, or should I go?
