Sad day, couldn't get anything right
Sad day, all we did was fight
And I just hope you understand
That we must take back foreign land
And then we'll sink into your sand
And I'll remove your fear
I'll remove your fear

Fight

Let us pray, God comes with us to battle
Let us pray, we'll kill their soldiers like cattle
And I just hope you understand
That we must take back foreign land
And then we'll sink into the sand
And I'll remove your fear
I'll remove your fear

Old man, my gun's bigger than your gun
Old man, my young's braver than your young
Who'll pay, when lives are cheaper than missiles
Who'll pay, when blood is thicker than oil

And I just hope you understand
That we must steal some foreign land
And I must prove that I'm a man
I will prove your fear
I will prove your fear

I will prove your fear
I will prove your fear
