Get to the race (hate)
The healing of it ing with
Conceal the scab you don't want to show (fate)
Into the hate (no)
I channel all the negative and (break)
I bled for days now I take the hold, go!

I don't believe it
F*ck me, read me, get me (bled for days)
Smile on my rage I'm
Scarred by age, I bled (bled for days)
