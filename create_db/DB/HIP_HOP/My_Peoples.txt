[Verse 1]
I've seen streets we're youth are forced to take the long way home
And I've seen mothers mourn the loss of there only born
Still I believe we are given nothin more than we can beg
A vision is only blurred when life seems unfair

Who am I to judge the man with the needle in his veins
When he's just chasing freedom to escape the pain
Of the worlds fast paced pipe dreams and shortcomings
He's just trying to make do and find a way out of nothing

Its like we damned if we do and damned if we don't
And it's a very thin line between respect and being broke

[Chorus]
And being one red button away from world war three
Always called the minority
And always always pulled over
Facing police brutality
Why is every street a living hell
Probably cause they want us to fail
Yeah three strikes and surely back to jail
Like the slave ships when they sail

[Verse 2]
Years and years of civil rights chasing to pass that bill
But ask yourself people have we changed or are we standing still
Down and out struggling
In this concrete jungle

One check away from starvation, poverty
But they say being free is about speaking your mind
Prophesise too much and that's where they draw the line
A line as thin as the line between war and peace
A line as thin as the line between west and east

[Chorus]

One button away from world war III
Being called a minority
And being pulled always being pulled over and subject to brutality
Why is every street like a living hell
Probably cause they all just want us to fail
And three strikes and surely back to jail
Like the slaves ship when they sail but they don't know that

My people whose pains are cornered
My peoples all shapes and colours
My peoples got more peoples with ills
That's more peoples more sistas and brothas
My people stay strong as an ox
My peoples will never fail
My peoples will always remain

Remain with a story to tell
My peoples was paints on the door
My peoples all shapes and colours
My peoples got more peoples with ills
That's more people more sistaz and brothaz
My people stay strong as an ox
My peoples will never fail
My peoples will always remain

Remain with a story to tell
My peoples was paints on the door
My peoples all shapes and colours
My peoples got more peoples in jail
That's more people than sistaz and brothaz
My people stay strong as an ox
My peoples will never fail
My peoples will always remain

Remain with a story to tell
My peoples was paints on the door
My peoples all shapes and colours
My peoples got more peoples with ills
More people more sistaz and brothers
My people stay strong as an ox
My peoples will never fail
My peoples will always remain
Remain with a story to tell
