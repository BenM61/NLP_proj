Sundown all around
Walking through the summer's end
Waves crash, baby, don't look back
I won't walk away again

Oh, baby, anywhere you go,
We are bound together
I begin, baby, where you end
Somethings are forever

Circle in the sand
Round and round
Never ending love is what we've found
And you complete the heart of me
Our love is all we need
Circle in the sand

Circle in the sand
Cold wind, tide moves in
Shivers in the salty air
Day breaks, my heart aches
I will wait for you right here

Oh baby when you look for me
Can you see forever?
I begin, baby, where you end
We belong together

Circle in the sand
Round and round
Rising of the moon as the sun goes down
And you complete the heart of me
Our love is all we need
Circle in the sand
Circle in the sand

Baby can you hear me?
Can you hear me calling?

Oh, baby, anywhere you go,
We are bound together
I begin, baby, where you end
Somethings are forever

Circle in the sand
Round and round
Never ending love is what we've found
And you complete the heart of me
Our love is all we need
(Circle in the sand)
