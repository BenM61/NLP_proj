You've been in love before 
But it always broke your heart 
You know those paper rings, girl, always fall apart
They say that nothing lasts too long 
But I know something that's gonna stay forever strong... 

Our love is timeless like a summer day 
Forever soulful like Marvin Gaye 
Baby, timeless as a melody 
I love you, baby, timelessly 

Ooh baby... ooh... 
Watching the world go by
Changing everyday 
They tear down a thing of beauty
To build some new highway
What's here today may disappear 
But baby, our love surely will survive the years 
Because it's timeless like a summer day 
And everlasting as a Shakespeare play 
Baby, timeless as a melody 
I love you baby, timelessly 

Ooh...
Where there is love
There is endless hope and boundless dreams 
When you got love 
There's no limits to be seen
Girl, you know what I mean 

They say that nothing lasts too long 
But I know something that's gonna stay forever strong...
Our love is timeless 
Like a summer day 
Forever soulful like Marvin Gaye
Baby, timeless as a melody 
I love you, baby, timelessly...

Timeless like a summer day 
Forever soulful as a Shakespeare play
Baby, timeless, as a melody 
I love you baby, timelessly... 
Ooh...
