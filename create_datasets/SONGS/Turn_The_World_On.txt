(I like to turn the whole world on)

I like to turn the whole world on just for a moment
Just for a moment
I like to turn the whole world on just for a moment
Just for a moment

(I like to turn the whole world on)

Stop me out, set it off
Beat so hard, they call the cops
This is how it's going down
You play with me
Am I get loud?

I hear Static everywhere
Getting down like Savoir Faire
Then they come up for air
Bottle pop play truth or dare

I like to turn the whole world on just for a moment
Just for a moment
I like to turn the whole world on just for a moment
Just for a moment

(I like to turn the whole world on)

Oh oh, I'm goin' to turn the whole world on
DJ drop that fuc*** song
Uh uh, I'll blow your mind
Uh uh, I'll blow your mind

All the boys in black and white
We're gonna get that up tonight
Uh uh, I'll blow your mind
Uh uh, I'll blow your mind

(Turn the whole world on, turn the whole world on)
I like to turn the whole world on

(Turn the whole world on, turn the whole world on...)

I like to turn the whole world on just for a moment
Just for a moment

Kissing you before
Getting sneaky on the floor
Keep stupid, disco whore
Keep from coming back for more

Blah, blah, blah
I say definitely, for sure
But I'm halfway out the door
Touch
