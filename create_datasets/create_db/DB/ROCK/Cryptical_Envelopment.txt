The other day they waited
The sky was dark and faded
Solemnly they stated
He has to die
You know he has to die

And all the children learning
From books that they were burning
Every leaf was turning
To watch him die
You know he had to die

The summer sun looked down on him
His mother could but frown on him
And all the others sound on him
But it doesn't seem to matter

And when the day had ended
With rainbow colors blended
His mind remained unbended
He had to die, you know he had to die
You know he had to die
