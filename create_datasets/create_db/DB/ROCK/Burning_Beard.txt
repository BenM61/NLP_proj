Every day I wake up we drink a lot of coffee and watch the CNN
Every day I wake up to a bowl of clover honey and let the locusts fly in
Lobsterbacks attack the town again
Wrap all my things in aluminum
Beams of darkness streak across the sky
Pink rays from the ancient satellite

Every time I look out my window same three dogs looking back at me
Every time I open my windows cranes fly in to terrorize me
The power of the Holy Ghost
The power of the Holy Ghost

Shadow of the New Praetorian
Tipping cows in fields Elysian
Saturnalia for all you have
The seven habits of the highly infected calve

Swan diving off the tongues of crippled giants
International Business Machine
Choking on bits of barley bread crumbs
Oh this burning beard I have come undone
Oh this burning beard I have come undone
It's just as I've feared, I have, I have come undone

Bugger, bugger, bugger dumb the last of academe
Okkam's razor makes the cutting clean
Shaven like a banker, lilac vegetal
Break the glass ceiling and golden parachute on down
The power of the Holy Ghost comes to town
Remove the shadow of the New Praetorian
Tipping cows in fields Elysian
Saturnalia for all you have
The seven habits of the highly infected calve
The seven habits of the highly infected calve
