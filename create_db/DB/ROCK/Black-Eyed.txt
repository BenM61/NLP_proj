I was never faithful
And I was never one to trust
Borderline and skitzo
And guaranteed to cause a fuss

I was never loyal
Except to my own pleasure zone
I'm forever black-eyed
A product of a broken home

I was never faithful
And I was never one to trust
Borderline by polar
Forever biting your nuts

I was never grateful
That's why I spent my days alone
I'm forever black-eyed
A product of a broken home
Broken home

Black-eyed, black-eyed
Black-eyed, black-eyed
Black-eyed, black-eyed
Black-eyed, black-eyed

I was never faithful
And I was never one to trust
Borderline and skitzo
And guaranteed to cause a fuss

I was never loyal
Except to my own pleasure zone
I'm forever black-eyed
A product of a broken home
Broken home

Black-eyed, black-eyed
Black-eyed, black-eyed
Black-eyed, black-eyed
Black-eyed, black-eyed
Broken home
Black-eyed
Broken home
Black-eyed
Broken home
Black-eyed
Broken home
Black-eyed
