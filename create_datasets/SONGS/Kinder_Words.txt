No time now for losing tempers
Or filling up with rage or anger
Flying off the handle could be detrimental
Calmer hands are called for here

A breath or two might be applied
We'll count to ten and then decide
A rash decision - crash collision
Damage done beyond repair

Kinder words here we could pick
A kind approach might do the trick
Hurt you, hurt me, well that needs to stop
Kinder words here we could choose

We've kind of got a lot to lose
The temperature we need that to drop
A wrong move now might spell disaster
A selfish one might spell it faster

Let's relax, review the facts
For all involved that might be best
A world of difference might be made
If our next move could be delayed

We'll sort it out and we'll talk about
Just what it was that caused this mess
Kinder words here we could pick
A kind approach might do the trick

Hurt you, hurt me, that's the worst thing we could do
Kinder words here we could choose
We've kind of got a lot to lose
Watch what we say, don't walk away, we'll see it through

Kinder words here we could pick
A kind approach might do the trick
Hurt you, hurt me, well that needs to stop
Kinder words here we could choose

We've kind of got a lot to lose
The temperature we need that to drop
