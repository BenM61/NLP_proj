Oh baby, my time has come
I'm gonna step aboard this ship today and head for the sun
Don't know what I'll see there
Don't know what I'll find
But baby, I'll be happy if I find a peace of mind

Time travel, it's been getting me down
I've been gone so long I don't ever think I'm coming down
I've seen tomorrow
And I've seen yesterday
Will I see your face again
Well baby, you know I just can't say
Oh no, no

No I just can't say
Baby, I'm comin' down
I'm comin' down
No I just can't say, baby
But I'm comin' down
Yeah I'm comin' down
Oh won't you take me away, baby
Take me away, away, away
Yeah

Will we see the sunshine, baby
Will we ride the skies
Will we find tomorrow, baby
Will we travel time

Will we see the sunshine, baby
Will we ride the skies
Will we find tomorrow, baby
Will we travel time

We own the sun, we own the sky
We own tomorrow and we want to fly...
