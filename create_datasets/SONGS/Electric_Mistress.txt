Why do I feel this way
Why do I feel this way
When we're dancing in a trance
Your love is at all I take
Trying to get through to you
Baby you're a red alert
I want you more and more
I want you so bad it hurts

You seem so disconnected
But when I turn you on you're so infective
Pretty Pollys my electric mistress (She's my baby)
And she's making like a maniac (She's my little maniac)

Baby I can't pretend
Baby I can't pretend
There's a maniac and it's you
Your a slave to every group
there's nothing in your eyes
Doing what I feel the same
What am I gonna do
You keep me under strain

You seem so disconnected
But when I turn you on you're so infective
Pretty Pollys my electric mistress (She's my baby)
And she's making like a maniac (She's my little maniac)

Why do I feel this way
Why do I feel this way
Why do I feel this way
Why do I feel this way
When we're dancing in a trance
Your love is all I take
