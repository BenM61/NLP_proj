Dark Child, Mary

'Cause the sex was good, you had my mind, and I let you come back every time
You would violate and cross the line
And you knew that I would be the type to
Always wait so patiently (thinking)
You was coming home to me (well)
Damn, I never heard the keys or
Felt your tap saying are you sleep (rewind that)

'Cause the sex was good, you had my mind, and I let you come back every time
You would violate and cross the line
And you knew that I would be the type to
Always wait so patiently (thinking)
You was coming home to me (well)
Damn, I never heard the keys or
Felt your tap saying are you sleep

Don't wanna play house no more
You so dumb to think that you gonna marry me
I got to be out my mind to think I
Need someone to carry me
I've done enough cryin', cryin', cry (crying, cryin', cry)
It's time to say bye, bye, bye
It's time to do something for me

Time to choose my clothes, choose my friends, be with my family
They been asking, 'girlfriend, where you been? We, ain't seen you in weeks.'
Been chasing this fool around, thinking he gonna hold me down
I would follow his lead thinking I'm gonna be the one he keep around
What I needed (not your finance)
And all that I needed (real commitment)
I really couldn't see it (not a real man)
You said you be there (in this relationship)
So many men (these men) think that all a girl (they think)
Needs is to be sold a dream, but I want
For real

Don't wanna play house no more
You so dumb to think that you gonna marry me
I got to be out my mind to think I
Need someone to carry me
I've done enough cryin', cryin', cry (crying, cryin', cry)
It's time to say bye, bye, bye
It's time to do something for me

Don't wanna play house no more
You trippin' more
I'm tired of you playing
Got me lookin' at the front door missing
You're missing more to let you play me
Don't wanna play house no more, no more
I'm tired of you playing
I've done enough cryin', cryin', cry
It's time to do something for me

You turned your back, and back I came running
But the simple fact is that you ain't want me
Done enough lying and crying to myself
Nothing left to do but move
What else can I do but leave?
I believed that you would marry me, but now I gotta breeze
I be's with LT when you come to your senses
But then it's too late
That's always how it be
Catch me with the B's on the wheels, gizeppi's on the hills
Shoulda Marc Jacob Fe Fe bagged me when you had me
Next dude will gladly pick up where you left off
Ice me, wife me, you ain't gonna have me
Cryin', cryin', cry, cryin', cryin', cry
It's time to say bye, bye, bye
It's time to do something for me

Don't wanna play house no more
You so dumb to think that you gonna marry me
I got to be out my mind to think I
Need someone to carry me
I've done enough cryin', cryin', cry (crying, cryin', cry)
It's time to say bye, bye, bye
It's time to do something for me

Don't wanna play house no more
You so dumb to think that you gonna marry me
I got to be out my mind to think I
Need someone to carry me
I've done enough cryin', cryin', cry (crying, cryin', cry)
It's time to say bye, bye, bye
It's time to do something for me

It's time to do something for me, for me, for me, for me
