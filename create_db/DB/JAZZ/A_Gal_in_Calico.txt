Met a gal in calico, down in Santa Fe;
Used to be her Sunday beau ?til I rode away.
Do I want her, do I want her love?
Yes siree!

Will I win her, Will I win her love?
Wait and see!
Workin' with a rodeo, go from town to town.
See most every kind a gal, every kind a gown.

But who made my heart sing
Yippee Yi! Yippee Yo!
My little gal in calico.
Take my gal in calico, down in Santa Fe;

Guess I'd better let her know that I feel this way.
Is she waitin' is she waitin'
She better be.
Am I hopin' to be ropin' her?

Yes siree!
Gonna quit the rodeo, gonna settle down,
Buy a bolt of calico for a weddin?gown.
Then will I fence her in

Yippee Yi! Yippee Yo!
My little gal in calico.
