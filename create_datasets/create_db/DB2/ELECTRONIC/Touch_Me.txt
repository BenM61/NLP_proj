Touch me...
Touch me...
Touch me now...

Touch me, touch me, I want to feel your body
Your heartbeat next to mine
Touch me, touch me now...
Touch me, touch me now...

Full moon in the city and the night was young
I was hungry for love, I was hungry for fun
I was hunting you down, and I was the bait
When I saw you there, I didn't need to hesitate

This is the night, this is the night
This is the time, we've got to get it right...

(this is the night)
Touch me, touch me, I want to feel your body
Your heartbeat next to mine
(this is the night)
Touch me, touch me now...
Touch me, touch me now...

Hot and cold emotion, confusing my brain
I could not decide between pleasure and pain
Like a tramp in the night, I was begging for you
To treat my body like you wanted to

This is the night, this is the night
This is the time, we've got to get it right...

(this is the night)
Touch me, touch me, I want to feel your body
Your heartbeat next to mine
(this is the night)
Touch me, touch me now...
Touch me, touch me now...

Touch me, touch me, I want to feel your body
Your heartbeat next to mine
(this is the night)
Touch me, touch me now...
Touch me, touch me now...

Touch me, touch me now...
Touch me, touch me now...
Touch me, touch me now...
Touch me, touch me now, yeah...

(this is the night)
Touch me, touch me, I want to feel your body
Your heartbeat next to mine
(this is the night)
'Cause I want your body, all the time...

Touch me, touch me, I want to feel your body
Your heartbeat next to mine
(this is the night)
Touch me, touch me now...
Touch me, touch me now...

Touch me, touch me now...
