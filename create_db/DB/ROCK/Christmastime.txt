Santa Claus is coming
And the kids are getting greedy
They know what's in the stores
Because they seen it on the TV

You go into the forest
And you cut down all the trees

I know you got a power saw
But who plants the seeds
I gotta buy a present

Can't remember who it's for

I'll see you in a hour
When I get back from the store
It used to be the birthday
Of The Man who saved our necks

Now it stands for Santa Claus
They spell it with an "X"!

It's Christmas time
