Take a look at me, tell me, can't you see,
I'm right in my cup,
I'm not myself tonight;
It's an awful curse when you have to nurse
A pair of sore pups,
Otherwise, everything's all right.

All dressed up, marcel and everything,
All pressed up, all set to have my fling,
Here am I, breakin' in a pair of shoesies.

I've got the date with someone I adore,
Now I'm late; I know he's good and sore,
Here am I, breakin' in a new pair of shoesies.

Some hot band will soon be deliverin', givin' out music that's mad,
Should I dance? Take a chance?
Ouch, my tootsies!
I don't know, feet may be breaking down, even so,
I've got to go to town,

Here goes breakin' in a pair of shoes!
All dressed up, marcel and everything,
Pressed up, all set to have my fling,
Here am I, breakin' in a pair of shoesies.

I've got the date with someone I adore,
Now I'm late; and I know he's good an dsore,
Here am I, breakin' in a pair of shoesies.

Ah, some hot band will soon be deliverin', givin' out music that's mad,
Should I dance? Take a chance?
Ouch, my tootsies!
I don't know, my feet may be breaking down,
Even so, I've got to go to town,
Here goes breakin' in a pair of shoes!
