I'm a perfectly normal lovesick individual
with a perfectly normal teenage devotion
They seem to be
so wonderfully clean
got to have you now

I am the cherry man
Hello, hello, hello
Your time has come my friend
Hello, hello, goodbye

Purity and innocence attract me
Her naive infant school smile caught me
I said - You seem to be
so perfectly clean
got to have you now

I am the cherry man
Hello, hello, hello
Your time has come my friend
Hello, hello, goodbye
