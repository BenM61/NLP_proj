Knowing you stand by me through good and bad
Makes all the difference in my life
And day by day, sweetheart, I find
These are the ties that bind

The little things you do that please me so
The way you always understand
When simple joys bring peace of mind
These are the ties that bind

You're all I need to see me through
Can I say more than this, my love
I live just for your kiss, my love
I live just for your kiss, my love

Forever and a day, my love will live
The flame of love will never die
So heart and soul please say you're mine
Held by the ties that bind
