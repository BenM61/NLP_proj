I know you like my style 
See I've noticed for a while 
Caught you looking at me one too many times 
If you like what you see 
Why don't you come talk to me 
I don't buy this act, 
I know you're not that shy 

Gonna take you on 
Betcha think about me when you're alone 
You can't stop it cause the feelings strong 
Move a little closer let me show you how it's done 
Now you know the score 
Gotta work your body on the dance floor 
Getting next to me is what you came here for 
Gonna get you hooked until your begging me for more 

I know that you want to get with me 
I can see that you've been checking me 
I can tell you want to get it on tonight 
Don't lie 
You can't hide 

Why you want to make it hard for me? 
Come on over here where you should be 
It's obvious, you're wanting me tonight. 

Your friends are telling me 
That you're really into me 
But I want a chance to find out for myself 
So give me a little sign 
See it's playing on my mind 
Maybe you and I should spend a little time 

Don't you want to see 
what could really happen with you and me 
I don't want to play no more hide and seek 
Let's get together, you know you got me weak 
Now you know the score 
You give me a feeling that I can't ignore 
Getting next to you is what I came here for 
Gonna keep you hooked until you're running back for more 

I know that you want to get with me 
I can see that you've been checking me 
I can tell you want to get it on tonight 
Don't lie 
You can't hide 

Why you want to make it hard for me? 
Come on over here where you should be 
It's obvious, you're wanting me tonight 

It's all about 
The way you move your body 
Why be shy? 
Don't you feel the heat, 
Don't you feel the need, 
Don't you want to dance with me 
And then you feel the rhythm taking over 
Burning through your veins 
I can't wait no
