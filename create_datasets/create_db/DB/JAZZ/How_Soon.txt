How soon will I be seeing you?
How soon?
I wish I really knew
When will I be hearing 
Words I want to hear?
Pretty little love words 
Whispered in, my ear

How soon will I be seeing you
And dance the way we used to do?
I see the starlight gleaming
Forgive me if I'm dreaming
Tell me, honey, now
How soon?

And when will I be hearing
Words I want to hear?
Pretty little love words
Whispered in, in my ear
How soon will I be seeing you
And dance the way we used to do?

I see the starlight gleaming
Forgive me if I'm dreaming
Tell me, honey, now
How soon?

I see the starlight gleaming
Forgive me if I'm dreaming
Tell me, honey, now
How soon?
