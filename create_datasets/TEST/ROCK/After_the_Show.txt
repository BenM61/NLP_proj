After the music of the Rock and Roll show
I started walking out nowhere special to go.
I heard someone singing in a voice so sad,
This is what I heard her singing 

Who's going to take me home
After the show?
I'm feeling really lonely 
And I've nowhere to go
Oh take me to your party
And I'll dance all night 
And hold you tight till morning comes'.

I walked up to her, took her by the hand.
I said 'Sad Lady, yes, I understand 
And I will stay with you if you want me to
And we can sing this song together' 

Who's going to take me home
After the show?
I'm feeling really lonely 
And I've nowhere to go
Oh take me to your party
And I'll dance all night 
And hold you tight till morning comes'.

After the music of the Rock and Roll show
I started walking home somewhere special to go
Our love grows stronger as time goes by 
But we can still remember singing 

Who's going to take me home
After the show?
I'm feeling really lonely 
And I've nowhere to go
Oh take me to your party
And I'll dance all night 
And hold you tight till morning comes'.
