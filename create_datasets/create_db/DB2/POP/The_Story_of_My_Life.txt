The story of my life
Is very plain to read
It starts the day you came
And ends the day you leave

The story of my life
Begins and ends with you
The names are still the same
And the story's still the truth

I was alone
You found me waiting
And made me your own
I was afraid 
That somehow I never could be
The man that you wanted of me

You're the story of my life
And every word is true
Each chapter sings your name
Each page begins with you

Stay with me here
Share with me
Care with me
Stay and be near

And when it began
I'd lie awake every night
Just knowing somewhere deep inside
That our love affair just might write -

The story of my life
So very plain to read
It starts the day you came
And ends the day you leave
