I met this girl, I think she likes me
I must admit I like her too
She said she'd be working tonight
I said cool I'll drop by and she looked at me, smiled, and said that's great, baby
When I showed up, I was confused

I said hey, where's that girl I talked to yesterday? 
Now I said hey, where is Destiny, is that her name? 
I can't believe she would leave
Without me, Destiny

How come you don't strip no more? 
Uh uh uh uh
How come you don't strip no more? 
Uh uh uh uh

I met your friends, I think they like me
(They like me) oh 
But they don't do it like you do (like you do)
They told me you were graduated, why didn't you say it? 
That's so cool
I'm just so proud you made it through

But I said hey, where's that girl I talked to yesterday? 
Now I said hey, where is Destiny, is that her name? 
I can't believe she would leave
Without me, Destiny

How come you don't strip no more? 
Uh uh uh uh
How come you don't strip no more? 
Uh uh uh uh

I was at table three, B.Y.O.B. 
Destiny sat next to me
She asked me if I liked her dance
I told her I'm your biggest fan
Then she took me by the hand, and turned this boy into a man
Inside a private room, I hope you understand
I was like uh uh (uh uh)
She made me go wee hee (wee hee)
Now I'm not mad that you don't want me
I'm just stuck here wondering
I wanna know

How come you don't strip no more? 
Uh uh uh uh
How come you don't strip no more? 
Uh uh uh uh

Why don't you strip no more, don't strip no more
Baby don't strip no more, don't strip no more
Don't strip no more, baby don't strip no more
Don't strip no more my baby, baby
Strip no more, baby, baby
She tells me that she won't God damn strip, strip, strip
She won't strip, strip, strip
She won't strip, strip, strip
She won't strip, strip, strip

No tips if you don't strip my baby
No tips if you don't strip my, where am I gonna put my dollar bills at?
How come you don't strip no more?
