I may be loose, I'm not a cannon
But I can be quiet saying my name
There are the weights where is the balance
Maybe everyone's to blame.

My heart and my mind have been with me always
But not long enough to keep them in mind
I know that my mind has both good and bad days
But my heart wins every time

I feel the fire,
I see a flame set me a light,
Bring me desire bottled up tight.
Like caging in the ocean
Dousing my sun, download the sky
Bring me emotion,
Bottled up tight.

I count when I can the people who walk by,
Imagine their paths crossing with mine,
And maybe it's true we're part of a blood line,
But we walk like we're pretty much blind.

I feel the fire,
I see a flame set me alight,
Bring me desire bottled up tight.
Like caging the ocean
Dousing my sun, download the sky
Bring me emotion,
Bottled up tight.

I feel the fire,
I see a flame set me alight,
Bring me desire bottled up tight.
Like caging the ocean
Dousing my sun, download the sky
Bring me emotion,
Bottled up tight.

I feel a fire bring me desire
I feel a fire bottled up tight.
Like caging the ocean, your flame my emotion
And give me devotion, bottled up tight.
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.
