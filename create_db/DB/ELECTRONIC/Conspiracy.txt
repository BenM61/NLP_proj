Entourage by the reservoir they're gonna test drive that new sports car
Meet around midnight less people around cut the alarm so there isn't a sound
You know damn well you know damn well what x4

The dogio and the catio are fighting on the patio
The neighbours need a hero 'cause someone's had their stereo

You know damn well you know damn well what x4

Entourage by the reservoir gonna test drive that new sports car
Meet around midnight there's no one around
Cut the alarm so there isn't a sound

You know damn well you know damn well what repeat to end
