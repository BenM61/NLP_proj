After everything has settled down
We can talk
But for now
Rock wit u
(Ooaoh)
There's so much you say without a sound
When we're getting down
Rock wit u

Amazed to find someone so fine
Up in here alone, I feel im bout to lose my mind
Was gonna spend the evening with my crew
Had no idea I would run into the likes of you
The dance floor is so ti-tight
Somewhat like the way my hands move on your thighs tonight
Oh you wanna turn that thing around
Girl I like the way that sounds
(Ooaoh)
Baby later on

After everything is settled down
We can talk
But for now
Just wanna Rock wit u
(Oaooh)
When we're on the floor, baby
There's so much you say without a sound
(Ohooh)
When we're gettin down
Wanna rock wit u
(Ooaoh)

Amazed like a kid by the things that you did
Specially when the DJ was playing the best of 'BIG'
Don't ever want this evenin' to end
But if it does I wanna know when can it start again
(Don't even know your name)
But Just your eyes alone makes me want to get out tha game
The towel is about to be thrown
Hopefully girl
(Ooaoh)
Later on

After everything is settled down
We can talk
But for now
I wanna Rock wit u
When we're on the floor
There's so much you say without a sound
The way we gettin' down
Rock wit u
(Ooaoh)
Maybe later on
After everything is settled down
We can talk
But for now
Just wanna Rock wit u
When we're on the floor (baby)
There's so much you say without a sound
When we' getting down
Wanna rock wit u
(Ooaoh)

Feels so good why not let it rock
Time will tell if we should be closer
Later on or just for the night
On the floor let the beats take us over
Love to sway from the left to your right
Can't let go, yo, my heart wants to hold you girl
Like my hands that's locked on your side
Feels so good, don't want to let go of you
Don't want to let go of ya
Let go of ya
Don't wan' let go of ya
Don't want to let go of ya

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oooh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oooh
Baby later on

After everything is settled down
We can talk
But for now
Just wanna Rock wit u
(Ooaoh)
When we're on the floor(baby)
There's so much you say without a sound
(So much you say without a sound )
When we're getting down
(When we're gettin' )
Baby don't just wanna rock wit you later on
(Later on)

After everything is settled down
(Baby girl,baby girl)
We can talk
(Baby girl,baby girl)
But for now
Rock wit u
(Ooaoh)
When we're on the floor
There's so much you say without a sound
When we're getting down
Rock wit u
