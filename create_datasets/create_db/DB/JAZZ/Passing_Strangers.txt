We seem like passing strangers now
How can you hurry by
There were never two who loved
Half as much as you and I

We seem like passing strangers now
Funny how things can change
We were so inseparable
Now you're acting very strange

The hands I used to touch
Don't even wave hello
How I miss your lips
You'll never know

If you would only turn to me
Speak my name just once more
You might find right there and then
Strangers can be lovers again

Strangers can be lovers again
