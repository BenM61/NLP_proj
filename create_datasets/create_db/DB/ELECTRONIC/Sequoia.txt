Sequoia
Javelin flame traveling
Sequoia, fury
He's the crown of pain
Why do I need your flame?

How could you care for me?
Violent love in motion

Love in motion

Javelin flame traveling
He's the crown of pain
Face down the final rape

How could you care for me?
Violent love in motion
Love in motion
How could you care for me?
Violent love in motion
Lucifer in the rain
How could you care for me?
Violent love in motion
