Hey girl, tell me what's your name? (what's your name?)
I, I like your style (I like your style)
Can I stick around and wrap to you a little while?

And hey, girl, don't turn away (don't turn away)
Please listen to what I have to say
Don't tell me something everyday
Please won't you stay, oh

All my life I've prayed for
Someone like you, oh yeah

Oh, the look, the look in your eyes
Tell me you feel the same way I do, oh yeah

And hey, girl (hey girl, hey girl), can I be your friend?
Can I see you again? 
No, don't walk away (don't walk away)
If in your heart you really wanna stay
Girl, what you feel is for real and believe me it's okay
