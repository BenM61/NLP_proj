Tuesday morning,
Never looked so good.
I'm already in,
In a daydream.

The sun is shining,
To wake me up.
No one around,
Just me and the sky.

I'm already in,
In a daydream.
I'm already in,
In a daydream.

The sky is calling,
Calling out my name.
Telling me just to stay,
Stay and don't go away.

I'm already in,
In a daydream.
I'm already in,
In a daydream.

In a daydream...
In a daydream...
In a daydream...
Already in a daydream...
