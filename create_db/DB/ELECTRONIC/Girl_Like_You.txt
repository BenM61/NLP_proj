If you want to live inside my head
Want to see what I have said
I will make you tremble
You'll tremble
Its fine with me

If you want to scream outside my door
Ill make you holler even more
I will make you sorry
So sorry
Its fine with me

(bridge)
I will make you undertsand forever
Ill make everybody disappear
I will make you hold my hand forever
Till I am standing clear

(chorus)
Magical
Mystical
Lifes a ball
Never had a girl like you

Insecure
Give me more
Not so sure
Never had a girl like you

Starry eyed
Clarified
Over lied
Never had a girl like you

(verse two)
I will make you sacrifice the lot
Once you see
What I have got
I can be deceitful, deceitful
It's fine with me

I will make you get inside my car
Then I'll drive you very far
I can make you breathless
So breathless
It's fine with me

(bridge)
(chorus)
(speech: english version)
You know I'm watching you
That's all I ever do
Your hands, your hair
You're everywhere I see

You know I am watching you
Just trying to see through
Those crazy words
You keep on serving me

(bridge)
(chorus x2)
(speech: french version)
Tu sais que je te vois
Je fais ca tout le temps
Tes main, (tes) cheuveux
Tu es partous, toujours

Tu sais que je te vois
Je tente de reveller
Le mots bizzares
Que tu veux me donner

(bridge)
(chorus till fade..)
