You've got yearnin' and I got burnin'
Baby, you look so, ohh, sweet and cunning
Baby, way down inside, woman you need love

Woman you need love, you've got to have some love
I'm gonna give you some love, I know you need love
Just gotta have love, gotta have some love

You make me feel so good, you make me feel all right
You make me feel so good, ohh, you make me feel all right
You make me feel so good, you make me feel all right

You're so nice, you're so nice
You're so nice, you're so nice
You're so nice, you're so nice
You're so nice, you're so nice

You're frettin' and I'm petting
A lot of good things, ohh, you ain't getting
Baby, way down inside, woman you need love

I know you need love, you just to have some love

I ain't foolin', you need schoolin'
Baby, you know you need coolin'
Woman, way down inside

Woman you need love, you've got to have some love
Ooh, you gotta have some love
Ooh, you gotta have some love
