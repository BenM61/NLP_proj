I touched the mirror and go inwards
Eyes an illusion optical
On an Escher stair
My feet won't take me anywhere

Are we moving or are we still?
I'd use my limbs they don't seem to want to
And nothing feels right
I'm acting out in a ?? style ?

Groove it out
Groove it out
Groove it out
Got to got to got to
Groove it out
Groove it out
Groove it out
Got to got to got to

Are we moving or are we still?
I'd use my eyes they don't seem to want her
And nothing feels right
I'm acting out in a ?? style

Another world slips by
And every fool I'm in up the street am I
It flickers off and on and off and on
Kaleidoscope I'm inside

Groove it out
Groove it out
Groove it out
Got to got to got to
Groove it out
Groove it out
Groove it out
Got to got to got to

Are we moving or are we still?
I'd use my eyes they don't seem to want her
And nothing feels right
I'm acting out in a ?? style ?

In the empty room
In the wilderness
In the dying light
ever since I ... I ...

In the empty room
In the dying light
Felt the wilderness inside inside insde

In the wilderness
in the dying light
is an empty room

Groove it out
