(I know there'll never ever be another you)

Just when I thought that you were mine alone
You told me there was someone new
Oh it's so hard to think of finding someone else
I know there'll never ever be another you

I can't forget the moments that we shared
And all the happiness we knew
And as I sit alone with these memories
I know there'll never ever be another you

I know there'll never ever be lips as sweet as yours
No there'll never ever be another you

I know it's hopeless to go on this way
But what is there for me to do
I've lost the only girl that I have ever loved
I know there'll never ever be another never ever be another
Never ever be another you
(Never ever be another) never ever be another you
