When I got out of my bed this morning
I noticed that it didn't have a right side
And my head feels like it's filled to the top
With pop and rocks and cyanide

There's an earthquake coming and you think you know
Where it started, but it started very long ago
I need a mongoose baby, and some Calgon to take me up outta here

Some days just chicken bones
You'd better f*ck off now, you'd better leave me alone
'Cause I'm about to explode, just like a Wonder bread bomb
And I don't care what I know, because I can't be wrong
Some days just chicken bones
You'd better f*ck off now, you'd better leave me alone
'Cause I'm about to explode, just like a Wonder bread bomb
And I don't care what I know, because I can't be wrong

Yes I know why you need it, 'cause your car broke down
And you wanna take the next bus outta this town
But if anybody's getting on the bus, dog, it's gonna be me

I know I don't need what you've got for me
Baby I do feel ready for me
You'd better watch out sugar, 'cause I'm about to get my old spice on

Some days just chicken bones
You'd better f*ck off now, you'd better leave me alone
Cos I'm about to explode, just like a Wonder bread bomb
And I don't care what I know, because I can't be wrong
Some days just chicken bones
I'm all jacked up on DC at my place alone
And I don't care what you think about my attitude
Because I can't be bothered with the likes of you

Some days just chicken bones
You'd better f*ck off now, you'd better leave me alone

And I don't care what I know, because I can't be wrong
Some days just chicken bones
I'm all jacked up on DC at my place alone
And I don't care what you think about my attitude
Because I can't be bothered with the likes of you
