Maybe you will qualify
And maybe you won't
Maybe you can multiply
And maybe you don't
Haunt me in the dead of night
And you can be so mean
If you're looking for a fight
Well, I'm a war machine
Is it just an exercise
In self restraint
Is your picture perfect size
Or a bitch to paint
Be my bloody valentine
Or a cruise ship whore
If you're working overtime
What you need me for

And if you wanna cry 'bout something
I'll make it something worth crying for
And if you need to curse my name
Curse Me Good!

And if you wanna lie 'bout something
Then make it something worth lying for
And if you need to curse my name
Curse me good

Baby isn't satisfied
Baby needed more
Baby left her alibi
At the front door
Be the morning sun in my eye
Or a new disease
Why should I apologize
I do as I please

And if you wanna cry 'bout something
I'll make it something worth crying for
And if you need to curse my name
Curse me good

And if you want to lie 'bout something
Then make it something worth dying for
And if you need to curse my name
Curse me good

Don't you smile at my face, spit on my back
Do you kiss your mother with a mouth like that

Love it, leave it, it's all good for me

Don't you smile at my face, spit on my back
Do you kiss your mother with a mouth like that

Love it, leave it, it's all good for me

Don't you smile at my face, spit on my back
Do you kiss your mother with a mouth like that

Love it, leave it, it's all good for me

Don't you smile at my face, spit on my back
Do you kiss your mother with a mouth like that

Love it, leave it, it's all good for me

Don't you smile at my face, spit on my back
Do you kiss your mother with a mouth like that

Love it, leave it, it's all good for me
