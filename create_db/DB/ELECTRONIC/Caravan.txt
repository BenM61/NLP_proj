Sun, here's the sun
Let's go to the lake
We'll take you down
Just say the word

Rain, here's the rain
Slip and slide in vain
Mud between our toes
Saturations take you home

They came through the sun
They came through the rain
Through this rocky terrain
A caravan

Everyone take note
We've dug here before
Here is where I'll lie
When this night is done

It's time I guess
As we go marchin' on
Live for every day
As if it were the last

They came through the sun
They came through the rain
Through this rocky terrain
A caravan

Sun, here's the sun
Let's go to the lake
We'll take you down
Just say the word

Rain, here's the rain
Slip and slide in vain
Mud between our toes
Saturations take you home

They came through the sun
They came through the rain
Through this rocky terrain
A caravan
