Sometimes I want to leave you 
Sometimes I want to go 
Right back where I came from 
Back where I belong 
But it never lasts for too long 
Always goes away 
Well I still don't look for reasons 
That's much too hard these days 

Why worry about the rain? 
Why worry about the problem? 
Honey Century City's got everything covered 

Well your mama gave you lovin' 
Mama held you near 
Baby mam a can't do nothin' 
Honey mama just ain't here 
And you can pretend all you want to 
But that won't work no more 
No you can't run back to daddy 
Yeah you tried that once before 

Why worry about your father? 
Why worry about your mother? 
Honey Century City's got everything covered 

We're gonna live in Century City 
Go ahead and give in, Century City 
Like modern men, modern girls 
We're gonna live in the modern world 

We're gonna live in Century City 
Go ahead and give in, Century City 
Like modern men, modern girls 
We're gonna live in the modern world 

Sometimes I get discouraged 
Sometimes I feel so down 
Sometimes I get so worried 
But I don't know what about 
But it works out in the long run 
Always goes away 
And I've come now to accept it 
As a reoccurring phase 

Don't worry about the rain 
Don't worry about the thunder
Honey Century City's got everything covered 

We're gonna live in Century City 
We're gonna live in Century City 
We're gonna live in Century City 
We're gonna live in Century City
