And I'm thinking what's the deal
With the facts that they conceal
But I'm thinking what's the harm
With a bit of rhetoric and charm

But I can't quite comprehend
A beginning or an end
No I can't quite stomach this

You and me we're gonna take
To the skies for common sake
We'll fly amongst the cirrus clouds
20,000 feet we'll clock the crowds
And from that height we'll leak the lies
And unveil our damaged skies
'cause we can't quite stomach this

Look, all I'm trying to say is
You're not getting any sleep tonight
You're not getting any sleep tonight
You're not getting any sleep tonight
You're not getting any sleep tonight

The sun and the sea could power us
No-longer cower in oil lust
Chernobyl is still a stain
Of the dangers of this game
I still can't quite comprehend
A beginning or an end
No I can't quite stomach this

Look, all I'm trying to say is
You're not getting any sleep tonight
You're not getting any sleep tonight 
You're not getting any sleep tonight
You're not getting any sleep tonight

We'll embark on our great voyage to the sun
And we'll be 90 million miles from anything or anyone
What are we waiting for?
What are we waiting for?
What are we waiting for?

Look, all I'm trying to say is
You're not getting any sleep tonight
You're not getting any sleep tonight 
You're not getting any sleep tonight
You're not getting any sleep tonight

We embark on our great voyage to the sun
We'll be 90 million miles from anything or anyone
Just like the ocean we won't be pacific anymore
No longer in coexistence with other species, this is flawed

You're not getting any sleep tonight
You're not getting any sleep tonight
You're not getting any sleep tonight
You're not getting any sleep tonight
