Yeah
Well everybody, they think they know us
They think they've got us figured out,
Waste their words just trying to tell us,
How the typical, predictable, young love turns out, yeah

Little do they know girl, we've got a fast car
A James Dean spirit and a Norma Jean heart.
This blank sheet of paper, has been waiting forever,
So baby just tell me where you wanna start

You and I, can fall as hard as we want
Make the story of our own, and blow Shakespeare's mind,
It's ours to write, it's our love and it's our life
Right or wrong, we'll write our own storyline
Na na na, na na na, na na na, storyline

We can pack for Paris, plan for Tennessee,
Oceans, mountains, hey I don't care as long as you're with me
Running like crazy, yeah, kissin' in public
Who cares what the world thinks girl they don't know nothing about us

You and I, can fall as hard as we want
Make the story of our own, and blow Shakespeare's mind,
It's ours to write, it's our love and it's our life
And right or wrong, we'll write our own storyline yeah

Yeah yeah

Let's make the story of our lives, whatever we wanna make it,
If there's rules about the way this works well I think it's time we break 'em,
From the moment I met you, there's just one thing I've been praying
If this boy gets you girl, girl will you take my name?

'Cause you and I can fall as hard as we want
Make the story of our own, and blow Shakespeare's mind,
It's ours to write, it's our love and it's our life
And right or wrong, we'll write our own storyline

I said right or wrong, we'll write our own storyline yeah
Na na na, na na na, na na na, oh yeah
It's all in our storyline,
its part of a storyline
It's all in our all in our storyline
