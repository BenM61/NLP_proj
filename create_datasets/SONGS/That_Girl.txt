In the bat of an eye
You already think about yourself
And I don't believe all the lies coming out of my mouth
Try to forget all the things that I did to myself and in time I see it fading

One of these these things just doesn't belong here
And look at that girl
Oh, I just don't belong here
And look at that girl

Aphrodite tonight
She's lifting up her dress and child
Her stomach was so tight
And she sees herself fading

One of these these things just doesn't belong here
And look at that girl
I just don't belong here
And look at that girl

And I'll try to catch my own vibe
Leave behind the countryside
Who I'll be?
What I'll be, 'cause it's my right to love desi

One of these these things just doesn't belong here
And look at that girl
I just don't belong here
And look at that girl (look at that, feel bad...)
