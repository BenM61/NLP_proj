Talk about the birdies that fly up in the trees
Talk about the moon and stars that we can see
You keep on pretending you don't know what's wrong with me
Come on - let's talk - about us

Talk about the good things, made us laugh and sigh
Talk about the bad things, brought tears to my eye
I think it's about time for you to realise
Come on - let's talk - about us

     Baby I'd swear to love you
     Till the very end
     I don't plan on stickin' around
     If it's just to be your friend to me

Talk, talk talk and talk, there's still nothing said
Every little thing we've been talking about has gone straight through your head
Sometime a litle girl I think, your heart has filled with lead
Come on - let's talk - about us

     Baby I'd swear to love you
     Till the very end
     I don't plan on stickin' around

Talk, talk talk and talk, there's still nothing said
Every little thing we've been talking about has gone straight through your head
Sometime a litle girl I think, your heart has filled with lead
Come on - let's talk - about us
Come on - let's talk - about us
Come on - let's talk - about us
