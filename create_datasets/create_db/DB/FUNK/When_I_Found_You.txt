I found love when I found you,
You're the song making my life complete.
And now I can say for me there's a brighter day, 'cause
I found love, baby, when I found you.

I have heard when love is new
Of sunny days, time never ends.
And now it's so clear that my sunny day is here, 'cause
I found love, true love, when I found you.

All alone, so sad, I rubbed in all my enptiness.
Then you touched this lonely heart, giving me a fresh new start.
Since you gave your love to me you've shown me how to care.
Tender love, now we share, with each other.

I found love when I found you.
Happiness lives in my heart today.
And now I can feel togetherness so real, 'cause
I found love, baby, when I found you.

I found love when I found you.

Tender love, now we share, with each other.

I found love when I found you.
You're the song making my life complete.
And now I can say for me there's a brighter day, 'cause
I found love, baby, when I found you.

Baby, when I found you
