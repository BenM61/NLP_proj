The good life is what I need
Too many people stepping over me
The only thing that's been on my mind
Is the one thing I need before I die

All I want
Is a little of the good life
All I need
Is to have a good time
Oh
The good life
All I want
Is a little of the good life
All I need
Is to have a good time
The good life
(The good life)

I don't really know who I am
It's time for me to take a stand
I need a change and I need it fast
I know that any day could be the last

All I want
Is a little of the good life
All I need
Is to have a good time
The good life
All I want
Is a little of the good life
All I need
Is to have a good time
The good life

Hold on, hold on
I always wanted it this way
(You never wanted it this way)
Hold on, hold on
I always wanted this way
(You didn't ask for it this way)
I always wanted it this way

(The good life)
All I want
Is a little of the good life
All I need
Is to have a good time
The good life
All I want
Is a little of the good life
All I need
Is to have a good time
The good life
(The good life)
