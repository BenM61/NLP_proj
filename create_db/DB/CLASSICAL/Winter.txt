If we hold onto each other
Life would be so sweet
If we hold onto each other
Life would be complete

All this time
Winter was coming
All this time
December air was blowing
All this time
Leaves of fall were stirring
All this time
Winter was coming

We can't hold onto each other
Life would be so sweet
We can't hold onto each other
Life would be complete

All this time
Winter was coming
All this time
December air was blowing
All this time
Leaves of fall were stirring
All this time
Winter was coming

This time
How can I take no
This time
How can I take no

If we hold onto each other
Life would be so sweet
If we hold onto each other
Life would be complete

All this time
Winter was coming
All this time
December air was blowing

All this time
Leaves of fall were stirring
All this time
Winter was coming

All this time
All this time
All this time
All this time
