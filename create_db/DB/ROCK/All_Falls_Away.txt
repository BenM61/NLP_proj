It used to be mine
A face so laced with doubt and daily pain
It used to be mine
A breath so spent on holding up the wait

You made me resign
And trade a dying ember for a flame
Fearing the sound of no one's voice
And nothingness fills the whole

All falls away, all falls away
All falls away, all falls away

It used to be mine
A head so full of memories never lived
It used to be mine
And island that the map said wasn't there

You made me resign
And trade a dying ember for a flame
Fearing the sound of no one's voice
The chill of the touch that's never felt
And nothingness fills the whole

All falls away, all falls away
All falls away, all falls away
All falls away, all falls away
All falls away, all falls away
