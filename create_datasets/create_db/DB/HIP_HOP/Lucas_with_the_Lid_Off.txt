Catch the vibes 
The reggae and the ragtime 
Catch the vibes, catch the vibes 
'cause it's Lucas with the lid off 
Catch the vibes, catch the vibes 
'cause it's Lucas with the lid off 
Watch me now, you hear me now 

Whatever bubbles, bubbles up 
I feel! 
Run come follow me 
Run come follow me now 

Whatever bubbles, bubbles up 
I feel! 
Run come follow me 
Run come follow me now 

Whatever bubbles, bubbles up 
I feel! 
Run come follow me 
Run come follow me now 

Whatever bubbles, bubbles up 
I feel! 
Run come follow me 
Run come follow me now 

I feel so good! 
Watch me now! 

Strike the right chord 
And Ill rap, rap my skull-cap 
Electric, until I blow my top off 
And rap my lyrics 
Right around the global ear-lobes 
In orbit by bit I make it fit 
'cause I'm here to knit myself together 
In whatever split form I format 
And after that 
I never stay the same 
And treat defeat like a doormat 
To jump around on 
I'm here to spread poetic confetti, you ready? 
Open, open, open up your skull-cap 
And let it rain, let it rain, let it rain, let it drain 
Only I'm too cool to have a good time 
But really I'm a muted trumpet type of talk-away 
Hey-ey-ey 
Move it to the front, take it off, take it off 
Catch the vibes 
'cause it's Lucas with the lid off 
Catch the vibes, catch the vibes 
Ho-oi-oi! 
'cause it's Lucas with the lid off 
Catch the vibes, catch the vibes 
Ho-oi-oi! 
'cause it's Lucas with the lid off 

Watch me now, you hear me now 

Whatever bubbles, bubbles up 
I feel! 
Run come follow me 
Run come follow me now 

Whatever bubbles, bubbles up 
I feel! 
Run come follow me 
Run come follow me now 

Whatever bubbles, bubbles up 
I feel! 
Run come follow me 
Run come follow me now 

Whatever bubbles, bubbles up 
I feel! 
Run come follow me 
Run come follow me now 

I feel so good! 
I feel so good! 

Welcome to my brain 
I've got the lid off 
My chest, I got my nut off 
The type of spirit 
That could break your framework 
That's tamed by the aim to stay the same 
Hear the voice of summer 
Za-za-za 
At once I got to hum a melody 
That represents the type of flow I kick 
When my tongue is swinging like a drumstick 
Of a jazzy type of lick 
Everybody's got the lid on tightly 
Afraid of what might be lurking right behind the knot of safety 
So undo yourself and watch my rhyme grow 
Out of my lyrical chimney 
But don't repeat my voice to the beat 

When you hear the track again 
Make up your own words 
'cause the rhythm is a conduit 
To break and split from the homegrown 
The well-known, its on to the unknown! 
See everyone's a firecracker microphone 
About to get hooked up and lit 
Look up and let, look up and let 
Whatever bubbles up out your head 
Spread the vibes and illuminate the sky 
'cause it's Lucas with the lid off 
It's Lucas with the lid off 
It's Lucas with the lid off 
Come on and take your lid off! 

Watch me now, you hear me now 

Freak the solo, freak the solo 
Just spread the vibes, kid 

Watch me now, you hear me now 

Whatever bubbles, bubbles up 
I feel! 
Run come follow me 
Run come follow me now 

Whatever bubbles, bubbles up 
I feel! 
Run come follow me 
Run come follow me now 

Whatever bubbles, bubbles up 
I feel! 
Run come follow me 
Run come follow me now 

Whatever bubbles, bubbles up 
I feel! 
Run come follow me 
Run come follow me now
