Oh whoa-oh

I take as much as I can get
I don't take any regret
I close my eyes to conjure up something
But it's just a faint taste in my mouth

I think I'm coming down
I think I'm coming down

By tomorrow I'll be leaving
By tomorrow I'll gone
If you want to tell me something
You had better make it strong

'Cause I think I'm coming down
I think I'm coming down
I think I'm coming down
I think I'm coming down

I think I'm coming down
(Here I go)
I think I'm coming down
(Here I go)
I think I'm coming down
(Here I go)
I think I'm coming down
Here I go

There I go

You abuse the ones who love you
You abuse the ones who won't
If you ever had a real heart
I don't think you'd know where to start

'Cause I think I'm coming down
I think I'm coming down
I think I'm coming down
Yeah, I think I'm coming down

Yes, I think I'm coming down
Yes, I think I'm coming down
