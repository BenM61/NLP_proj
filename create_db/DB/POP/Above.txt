When you've seen the light
And it's blinded you
You know what's right
And what's wrong for you

so don't count the days
It will never come
Save your time
He's not the one

the sun will set
On another love
Stop the beating now
And trust above

these are the desperate times
But no need to rush
Why pursue the chase
When you've had enough?
