I spent the whole night long
On my hotel-phone
A letter's too long
Don't you know
We talked we laughed
And sighed
Kissing the air
Said good-bye
I m never the first to
Hang-up the phone
I d rather kiss instead
But isn't this just
The way we live

I might be kissing the sheets
I might be hugging the pillow
All night long
But I don't mind
Cause I have you on my mind
I might be kissing the sheets
I might be hugging the pillow
All night long
But I don't mind
'cause I have you on my mind
All night long
I don't mind
'Cause I'll kiss in time

It's time my train has arrived
I take a slow step inside
How time has passed by
Don't you konw
We only had a day
We say hello
Who can't stay
I'm glad we had this
Day anyway
We'd rather kiss instead
But isn't this just
The way we live

I might be kissing the sheets
I might be hugging the pillow
All night long
But I don't mind
'Cause I have you on my mind
I might be kissing the sheets
I might be hugging the pillow
All night long
But I don't mind
'Cause I have you on my mind
All night long
I don't mind
'Cause I have you on my mind
