Well I was born on the side of the road, 
A gap in the hedge, 
Did you hear what I said? 
Born in a house with no slates, 
But I wouldn't switch, 
I didn't have a stitch, 
Always been out on a limb, 
I've been hard to mend, 
Like a kick in the shin. 
You'll only see me smile, 
When I eat up a country mile. 

Born on the green light,  
A mission to move, 
Something to prove, 
An itch in my shoes, 
I heard then wail of a train, 
From a burnin' stack,  
And I jumped on the back, 
Well the engineer threw the switch, 
And it got to my brain,  
I've never been the same. 

You'll only see me smile, 
When I eat up a country mile. 

Gotta make tracks,  
Gotta raise the dust, 
Grease my heels, 
Out race the bus, 
Don't blink your eyes, 
You won't see me again. 

Born a spoke of the wheel, 
Not a part of the set, 
And I'm running yet, 
I ran before I could walk, 
The price of the fare, 
Was hardly ever there, 
I saw an eight wheeler move, 
And I couldn't choose, 
I just had to cruise. 

You'll only see me smile, 
When I eat up a country mile.

Don't blink your eyes, 
Or you won't see me again. 

Yea
