I was so busy doing things
Doing things that I wasn't supposed to
And I, know you might not believe me babe
But I love you
For each tear, forgive me
It was honor that you loved me
That I made you cry
I want you to know that I
I apologize, and I'm praying that it's not to late

Girl, if I, if I should lose you girl
If I can't make love to you girl
If I have thrown our love away
I don't know what I'm gonna do

I can't imagine it
I can't imagine my life without you
And I, I can't even ? someone else loving you
Don't turn away from me
And leave me here, down on my knees
Without you I'm dying
Won't you come save my life
Now I realize
That I'll never love the way that I love you

Girl, if I, if I should lose you girl
If I can't make love to you girl
If I have thrown our love away
I don't know what I'm gonna do

Ohhhh, I know, I know I was wrong
With you I belong
If our love is gone
How can I carry on
I'm so alone
Without you to hold
Won't you come home If I

Girl, if I, if I should lose you girl
If I can't make love to you girl
If I have thrown our love away
I don't know what I'm gonna do
