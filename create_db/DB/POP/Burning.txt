It was the sight of you
In those ten dollar shoes
First made me jump for joy
Your foreign kiss in Indianapolis
Is out of my mind hardly any time

[Chorus]
'Cause l've been
Burnin', burnin', baby burnin', burnin'
Burnin' for you, baby all night long
Burnin', burnin', baby, burnin', burnin'
Burnin' for you, baby, all night long

A sight was to be seen in a Ramada Inn
One day late last July
The party up for grabs left
In a Checker Cab
You sweet little thing, I'll give you a ring
'Cause l've been

[Chorus]

I've been

[Chorus]
