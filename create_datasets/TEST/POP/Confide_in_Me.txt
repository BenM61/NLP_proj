I stand in the distance
I view from afar
Should I offer some assistance
Should it matter who you are

We all get hurt by love
And we all have our cross to bear
But in the name of understanding now
Our problems should be shared

Confide in me
Confide in me

I can keep a secret
And throw away the key
But sometimes to release it
Is to set our children free

We all get hurt by love
And we all have our cross to bear
But in the name of understanding now
Our problems should be shared

Confide in me 
Confide in me
Confide in me
Confide in me

Stick or twist, the choice is yours
Hit or miss, what's mine is yours
Stick or twist, the choice is yours
Hit or miss, what's mine is yours

We all get hurt by love
And we all have our cross to bear
But in the name of understanding now
Our problems should be shared

Confide in me 
Confide in me
Confide in me
Confide in me

Confide in me 
Confide in me
Confide in me
Confide in me
