Voodoo warning
Is calling
Down in limbo

Moonlight lush life
Bears strange fruit
Down in limbo

Come with me now
A moth to a flame
You never get near enough

You try again
Closer now
Oh how we dance

The spirit holding us
In a trance
Bamboo dancer

No stranger
Down in limbo
Can you tango?

Takes two to
Down in limbo
You are the one

Now is the time
Let your memory beat the drum
On the street car line

Voodoo warning
Is calling
Down in limbo

Moonlight lush life
Bears strange fruit
Down in limbo

Creole tattoo
I buy you
Down in limbo

Heartbeat you mistreat
I owe you
Down in limbo
