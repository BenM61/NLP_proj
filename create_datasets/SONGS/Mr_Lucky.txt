They call me, Mr. Lucky.
Bad luck don't follow me.
They call me, Mr. Lucky.
Bad luck don't follow me.

Evrything I touches turn to gold.
That mean I can't do no wrong.
I woke up early one mornin'.
Mr. Lucky, standin' by my bed.

I woke up early one mornin'.
Mr. Lucky, standin' by my bed.
I listened to him real closely.
This is what he said.

'You was born for good luck, Johnny.'
'Bad luck can't do you no harm.'
'You was born for good luck.'
'Bad luck can't do you no harm.'

'Keep your black cat bone and a mojo hand.
'I guarantee you'll never go wrong'.
(guitar solo & instrumental)
That's why they call me, Mr. Lucky.

Bad luck don't follow me.
That's why they call me, Mr. Lucky.
Bad luck don't follow me.
Ev'rything I touches turn to gold.
I never felt misery.
