All the time I thought there's only me
Crazy in a way
That no one else could be
I would have given everything I own
If someone would have said
You're not alo-one

All the time I thought that I was wrong
Wanting to be me
But needing to belong
If I had just believed in all I-I had
If someone would have said
You're not so bad

All the time
All the wasted time
All the years
Waiting for a sign
To think I had it all...
All the time

All the time I thought there's only me
Crazy in a way 
That no one else could be
I can't believe that you were somewhere-ere too
Thinking all the time
There's only you

All the time
All the wasted time
All the years
Waiting for a sign
To think I had it all...
To think I had it a-all...
To think I had it a-a-a-all...
A-all the time...
