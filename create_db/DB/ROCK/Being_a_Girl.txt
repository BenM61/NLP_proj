Being a boy's like sucking on a lemon
And I judge myself by the adverts I see
My deodorant hides the real me
These things elevate me above animals

I feel like being a girl
Being a girl
And my life never tasted sweeter

I'm so boring, my clothes want to keep
Someone else warm, someone cooler
Tax on cigarettes, treats my cancer
These things elevate me above animals

I feel like being a girl
Being a girl
And my life never tasted sweeter
