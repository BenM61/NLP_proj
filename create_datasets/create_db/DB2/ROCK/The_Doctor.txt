Don't you send for the doctor 'cause I'm dyin' the blues
I got nothin' to live for and nothin' to lose

And I know in my mind, in my heart
That we live two worlds apart
And I know in my mind I can't bear
To lose all the things that we share

Don't you call for the doctor 'cause I'm cryin' in shame
I got no excuses 'cause I'm the one to blame

And I know in my heart it's all up to you
To give me the chance that I gave to you
And I know in my mind I can't bear
To lose all the things that we share

Don't you call for the doctor 'cause I'm cryin' in shame
I got no excuses 'cause I'm the one to blame

And I know in my mind, in my heart
That we live two worlds apart
And I know in my mind I can't bear
To lose all the things that we share

And I know in my mind it's all up to you
You gotta know in your heart, it's all up to you
Would you please give me the chance that I gave to you
