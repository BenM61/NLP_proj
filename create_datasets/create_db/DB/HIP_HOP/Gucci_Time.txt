I need everybody to report to tha dance floor right now
Tha world is very different now,
You know why it's Gucci time

Big Gucci trap boys call me Brick Gucci
Dime piece time piece got my Swiss movin'
Swiss cheese out a hater if he act foolish
Swizz Beats Gucci Mane call it trap music
I think I need an ESPY the rappers best respect me
They try to Ron Artest me the gone have to arrest me
With a doubt I bring 'em out
The kid is all she think about
She cheated wit la flare
But he didn't spill a drink about her
Do you know what time it is
Gucci time
Fifteen for every diamond bitch
I'm hood rich wealthy and all that there
I own forty bars but I have no idea

Its Gucci time!
Cut the lights on, cut these fuckin' lights on
All this ice on ain't no need to cut the lights on
Cut the lights on, cut these fuckin' lights on
All this ice on ain't no need to cut the lights on

Its Gucci time!
Cut the lights on, cut these fuckin' lights on
All this ice on ain't no need to cut the lights on
Cut the lights on, cut these fuckin' lights on
All this ice on ain't no need to cut the lights on

Its Gucci time!
Came in drankin'
Rollin' up stanky
White boy wasted
Frat house wasted
Amazin'
Like my bracelet
I'm flossin'
R.i.p the mike the ice got my chest moon walkin'
Cabbage patchin'
Bouncin'
Like Bankhead'
Pull up in the drop top Ferrari on Bankhead
Colder than a polar bear sleepin' in the freezer
She wish she never met me, wanna catch amnesia
Gucci mane crazy I might pull up on a zebra
Land on top an eagle smoke a joint of reefa
Standin' on the sofa spillin' liquor on the speaker
Call the paralegal 'cause this shit should be illegal

Its Gucci time!
Cut the lights on, cut these fuckin' lights on
All this ice on ain't no need to cut the lights on
Cut the lights on, cut these fuckin' lights on
All this ice on ain't no need to cut the lights on

Its Gucci time!
Cut the lights on, cut these fuckin' lights on
All this ice on ain't no need to cut the lights on
Cut the lights on, cut these fuckin' lights on
All this ice on ain't no need to cut the lights on

Its Gucci time!
Keep tockin' a tockin' to keep tickin'
Ya Rollie ain't real if the bitch keep tickin'
A hundred thou' on the shoes and socks ain't nothin'
A hundred thou' on the wrist band aint nothin'
Keep tockin' a tockin' to keep tickin'
Ya Rollie ain't real if the bitch keep tickin'
A hundred thou' on the shoes and socks ain't nothin'
You ain't sayin' nothin', you ain't doin' nothin'

Cut the lights on, cut these fuckin' lights on
All this ice on ain't no need to cut the lights on
Cut the lights on, cut these fuckin' lights on
All this ice on ain't no need to cut the lights on

It's Gucci time!
Hands up!
Its Gucci time!
