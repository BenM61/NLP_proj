There goes Moses carrying his bible book
Never has a problem, just has a cup
It's good clean alcohol and it fills you up
And here I go laughing like a fool, yeah

Things ain't working out down at the farm
Got no bag or baggage or love to keep me warm
And I ain't been in trouble since the day I was born
Things ain't working out down at the farm

I used to spend my sunny days supping aways
Along came Gogarty and he put me away
Down at the station was kept for strays
And I went laughing, geez he like busting me, he liked busting me

He caught me unawares and he made me strip naked
Oh I was scared, oh I was scared, I was shaking
And he said
It's you and me
And me and you
And me and me
And you and you
And me and me
And I just kept laughing like a fool, yeah

Things ain't working out down at the farm
