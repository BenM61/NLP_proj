Somebody called me on the phone
They said, "Hey, is Dee Dee home?
Do you wanna take a walk? You wanna go cop?
You wanna go get some Chinese Rocks?

I'm living on a Chinese Rock
All my best things are in hock
I'm living on a Chinese Rock
Everything is in the pawn shop, it is

The plaster's falling off the wall
My girlfriend's crying in the shower stall
It's hot as a bitch, I shoulda been rich
Now, I'm just digging a Chinese ditch

I'm living on a Chinese Rock
All my best things are in hock
I'm living on a Chinese Rock
Everything is in the pawn shop, it is

Ooh, aah, ooh, aah

The plaster's falling off the wall
My girlfriend's crying in the shower stall
It's hot as a bitch, I shoulda been rich
Now, I'm just digging a Chinese ditch

I'm living on a Chinese Rock
I'm living on a Chinese Rock
I'm living on a Chinese Rock

I'm living on a Chinese Rock
I'm living on a Chinese Rock
I'm living on a Chinese Rock
