Thou shalt not kill
Thou shalt not die

Cry!

Last fire will rise
Behind those eyes
Black house will rock
Blind boys don't lie

Immortal fear
That voice so clear
Through broken walls
That scream I hear

Cry, little sister! (Thou shalt not fall)
Come, come to your brother! (Thou shalt not die)
Unchain me, sister! (Thou shalt not fear)
Love is with your brother! (Thou shalt not kill)

Blue masquerade
Strangers look on
When will they learn
This loneliness?

Temptation heat
Beats like a drum
Deep in your veins
I will not lie

Little sister! (Thou shalt not fall)
Come, come to your brother! (Thou shalt not die)
Unchain me, sister! (Thou shalt not fear)
Love is with your brother! (Thou shalt not kill)

My Shangri-Las
I can't forget
Why you were mine
I need you now!

Cry, little sister! (Thou shalt not fall)
Come, come to your brother! (Thou shalt not die)
Unchain me, sister! (Thou shalt not fear)
Love is with your brother! (Thou shalt not kill)

Cry, little sister! (Thou shalt not fall)
Come, come to your brother! (Thou shalt not die)
Unchain me, sister! (Thou shalt not fear)
Love is with your brother! (Thou shalt not kill)
