Talkin' to myself again 
Wondering if this travelin' is good 
Is there something better we'd be doing if we could 
And oh the stories we could tell 
And if this all blows up and goes to hell 
I can still see us sittin' on the bed in some motel 
Listenin' to the stories we could tell 

Remember that guitar in a museum in Tennessee 
And the nameplate on the glass brought back twenty melodies 
And the scratches on the face 
Told of all the times he fell 
Singin' every story he could tell 
And oh the stories it could tell 
And I bet you it still rings like a bell 
And I wish we could sit back on the bed in some motel 
And listen to the stories we could tell 

So if you're on the road tracking down here every night 
And you're singin' for a livin' 'neath the brightly colored lights 
And if you ever wonder why you ride this carousel 
You did it for the stories you could tell 
And oh the stories we could tell 
And if this all blows up and goes to hell 
I can still see us sittin' on the bed in some motel 
Listenin' to the stories we could tell 
I can still see us sittin' on the bed in some motel 
Listenin' to the stories we could tell
