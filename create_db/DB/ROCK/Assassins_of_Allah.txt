Guide us o thou genie of the smoke
Lead us to a thousand and one nights
In the perfumed gardens of delight

It is written in the soul of the desert
It is written in the signs in the stars
It is written in the sands of the hour-glass
It is written

It is written in the eye of the falcon
It is written in the shade of the scorpion
It is written in the wealth of the sun
It is written

It is written that man's truth is a mirage
It is written that death is an oasis
It is written for all unbelievers
It is written
