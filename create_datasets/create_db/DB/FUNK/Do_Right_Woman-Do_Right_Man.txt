Take me to heart
And I'll always love you
And nobody can make me do wrong
Take me for granted, leaving love unsure
Makes will power weak
And temptation strong

A woman's only human
You should understand
She's not just a plaything
She's flesh and blood just like her man
If you want a do-right-all-day woman (woman)
You've got to be a do-right-all-night man (man)

Yeah yeah,
They say that it's a man's world
But you can't prove that by me
And as long as we're together baby
Show some respect for me

If you want a do-right-all-day woman (woman)
You've got to be a do-right-all-night man (man)

A woman's only human
Yes, you should understand
She's not just a plaything
She's flesh and blood just like her man
If you want a do-right-all-day woman (woman)
You've got to be a do-right-all-night man (man)
You've got to be a do-right-all-night man (man)
