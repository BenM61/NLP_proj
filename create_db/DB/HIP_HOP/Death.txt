Let me live my life!
We can no longer live our lives
Then let us give our lives for the liberation
And salvation of the black nation
Saints, saviors, soldiers, scholars, healers and killers
No longer dead, deaf, dumb and blind out of our mind!
Brain-washed with the white men's mind
No more homicide!
No more fratricide!
No more suicide, infanticide and, genocide!
Look that goddamn white man in his cold, blue-eyes
Devil don't even try, we bebe's kids!
We don't die, we, multiply!
You heard the death side
Open your black eyes for the rebirth
Resurrection, and rise!
