Bless this house, O Lord, we pray.
Make it safe by night and day.
Bless these walls so firm and stout,
Keeping want and troubles out.

Bless the roof and chimney top.
Let thy love flow all about.
Bless this house that it may prove
Ever open to joy and truth.

Bless us all that we may be 
Fit, O Lord, to dwell with thee.
Bless us so that one day we,
May dwell, dear Lord, with thee.
