Zing zing, zoom zoom
My little heart goes boom
When I hear this melody playin'

Zing zing, zoom zoom
A little simple tune
Who cares what the words may be sayin'

Zing zoom, zoom zoom
You hear it once and soon
You'll find that you're hummin' an' swayin'

It's more than a waltz for after it halts
It lingers with you night an' day
With this song in mind
Your troubles you'll find
Zing zing an' zoom zoom away

Zing zing, zoom zoom
My little heart goes boom
When I hear this melody playin'

Zing zing, zoom zoom
A little simple tune
Who cares what the words may be sayin'

Zing zing, zoom zoom
You hear it once and soon
You find that you're hummin' an' swayin'

Get under a shower an' sing for an hour
You'll feel like a million all day
For this song is great
For takin' off weight
Zing zing an' zoom zoom away

And ladies you can get most any man
Through your matrimonial doors
And this song cannot miss
And then add a kiss
Zing zing an' zoom zoom he's yours

Zing zing, zoom zoom
My little heart goes boom
When I hear this melody playin'

Zing zing, zoom zoom
A little simple tune
Who cares what the words may be sayin'

Zing zing, zoom zoom
You hear it once and soon
You'll find that you're hummin' an' swayin'

So, whether you're young
Or whether you're old
Or whether you work or you play

Take time out, be wise get out, vocalize
An' zing, zoom zoom zoom
Zing zing an' zoom zoom
Zing zing an' zoom zoom away
