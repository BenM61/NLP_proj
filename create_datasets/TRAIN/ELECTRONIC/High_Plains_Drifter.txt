The High Plains Drifter, and I'm the drifter
('Cause I'm a High Plains Drifter, drifter)
The High Plains Drifter, and I'm the drifter
('Cause I'm a High Plains Drifter, drifter)
They can't catch me they're never gonna find me
('Cause I'm a High Plains Drifter, drifter)
They're never gonna know that I'm the High Plains Drifter
Pulled over to the river to take a rest
Pulled out a pair of pliers, pulled the bullet out of my chest
Fear and loathing across the country listening to my 8 track
I reached behind the seat and snatched a Kool from the pack
A long distance from my girl, and I'm talking on the cellular
She said that she was sorry and I said yeah, the hell you were
Check my rear view mirror, check the gold tooth display
Check out the odometer and I was on my way
'Cause I'm the High Plains Drifter, the best that you can get
A strapped shoplifter, a pirate on cassette
('Cause I'm a High Plains Drifter, drifter)
Bust a Travis Bickle when I feel that I'm getting pushed
Don't step to me or you're gonna get mushed
('Cause I'm a High Plains Drifter, drifter)
I'm doing one hundred twenty plowing over mail boxes
Radar detector to tell me where the cops is
Spend another night at the Motel six
It's five dollars extra get the porno flicks
And then I concoct a Black and Tan in my brandy snifter
I'm a kleptomaniac, K-Mart shoplifter
Cash flow getting low so I had to pull a job
I found a nice place to visit but a better place to rob
I left my car outside, and the engine still revvin'
Taking care of business at seven-eleven
And then I went inside to make my withdrawal
I saw what he had had, but I had to take it all
Knucklehead deli tried to gyp me on the price
So I clocked him off the turban with a bag of ice
'Cause I'm mell-el-o like jell-el-o, cool like lemonade
I made my getaway and then I thought that I had it made
I feel like Steve McQueen, a former movie star
Look in my rearview mirror seen a police car
Ballantine quarts with the puzzle on the cap
I couldn't help to notice I was caught in a speed trap
Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry, on the run from Dirty Harry
Stash the cash in the dash, but my gun I did carry
I'm seeing blue and red flashing deep in the night
I got my alibi straight and I pulled over to the right
The cop knocked on my window, said boy, where's the fire?
You've got a mailbox on your bumper and a bald front tire
Outta the car longhair, your goose is cooked
Read me my rights, fingerprinted, and booked
Makin' like a D.T. driving a Gran Fury
Wherever I hang my hat's my home and my past is kind of blurry
('Cause I'm a High Plains Drifter, drifter)
Every dog will have its day, mine will be in front of a jury
I'm the High Plains Drifter you know that I'm never in a hurry
('Cause I'm a High Plains Drifter, drifter)
Read me my rights, as if I didn't know this
Threw me in the tank with a drunk called Otis
With his five o' clock shadow, he smelled of three day old beer
My man turned to me and said why are you here
I said I'm charming, I'm dashing, I'm rental car bashing
I'm phony paper passing at Nix Check Cashing
I went before the judge he sent me to the Brooklyn House of D
He said you behave son or we'll throw away the key
Houdini'd out the cuffs, I kicked the screw in the knee
I took the bailiff's wallet and went straight to OTB
I had a good feeling, easy come, easy go
I bet on one horse to win and another to show
And sure enough that nag came in
Brought my ticket to the window and collected my win
And then I broke into my new car with a wire coat hanger
Hot wired, hot wheeled, and Suzy is a headbanger
