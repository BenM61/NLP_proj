Here I sit, a nobody with no one
Bein' me ain't really all that fun
Leavin' her wasn't very smart
Admittin' I was wrong would be so hard

If it was cool to be a fool
I'd be the hippest guy around
If a heartache made you famous
I'd be know from town to town
It tears were made of pennies
And cold beer brought her back
My bank account and self esteem would both be in the black
If some Hollywood producer made a movie that was sad
About some guy who lost the best thing he ever had
Hey, I could be a star
If it was cool to be a fool

But we all know the way it really is
You don't get recognized for doing things like this
You spend a lot of time feelin' sorry for yourself
It doesn't really mean that much to anybody else

If it was cool to be a fool
I'd be the hippest guy around
If a heartache made you famous
I'd be know from town to town
It tears were made of pennies
And cold beer brought her back
My bank account and self esteem would both be in the black
If some Hollywood producer made a movie that was sad
About some guy who lost the best thing he ever had
Hey, I could be a star
If it was cool to be a fool
Hey, I could be a star
If it was cool to be a fool
