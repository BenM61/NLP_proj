The party's over everybody go home
I'm sorry but I'd like to be alone
'Cause every time I see her I have to weep
I'm gonna cry myself to sleep

I threw this party never thought she'd come by
All she wants to do is see me cry
And when I see her I just have to weep
I'm gonna cry myself to sleep

Cry

Did ya notice how she danced with every guy but me
She loves to see me in misery
I used to be her little buttercup
But now she comes around just to break me up

So everybody won't you please go home
The party's over and I'd like to be alone
'Cause when I see her I just have to weep
I'm gonna cry myself to sleep
