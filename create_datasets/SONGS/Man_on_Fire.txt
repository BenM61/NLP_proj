I walk these streets each and every day
Trying to find some work just to earn my pay
Just to make some plans for you some day.
But plans don't work and it's not that fine,

When you got no money all you got is time;
Don't it make you stop and wonder why?
Sometimes I feel like a man on fire,
Sometimes I feel like a man possessed,
Sometimes I want to burn down this crazy town.

I walk these streets each and every night,
Feel like I'm playing my role but it fits too tight.
Watch my life go by in black and white.
When times are hard and times are rough
Then you better be made of sterner stuff.

You'll find it's time to stop and wonder why.
I'm smokin', I'm burnin',
I'm twisting and turning
But one thing I'm learning.

It's the power of your love keeps me under their thumb
'cause the beat of your heart is the beat of my drum;
Don't it make you stop and wonder why?

Sometimes I feel like a man on fire,
Sometimes I feel like a man possessed,
Sometimes I want to burn down this crazy town.
Sometimes I feel like a man on fire,

Sometimes I feel like a man possessed,
Sometimes I want to burn down this crazy town.
Sometimes I feel like a man on fire,
Sometimes I feel like a man possessed,

Sometimes I want to burn down this crazy town.
Sometimes I feel like a man on fire,
Sometimes I feel like a man possessed,
Sometimes I want to burn down this crazy town
