I don't wanna play aroun' no more 
I see that black cross painted on your door 
We was good friends for a long, long time 
But baby you got hungry for a life of crime 
Get the message now? 

The car you drive is painted red and grey 
But if you ask me to get in 
Well I'll jst run away 
We was good friends for a long, long time 
But baby you got hungry for a life of crime 

Get the message now?
