I love the way you make me love you
I love the way you make me smile
I love the way you make me want you
Sit right down and stay awhile

'Cause with you by my side
I know I can make it
Oooh, just give me your love
I want you so much and I love you

Of all the times we've been together
It's so hard to let them go
Or could it be it'll last forever
Only time will let us know

'Cause with you by my side
I know I can make it
Oh, just give me your love
I want you so much and I love you
And I need you 

I love the way you make me love you
I love the way you really do
For me there couldn't be no other
Just thinkin' the things that we've been thru,

'Cause with you by my side
I know I can make it
Oooh, just give me your love
I want you so much and I love you 
And I need you
And I love you
And I need you
And I love, you

I yeah
I oh 
Oh
La

I love you
I love you
I love you
La la la
