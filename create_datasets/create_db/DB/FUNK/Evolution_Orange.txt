Seeing
Seeing is believing
It's the greatest feeling
Knowing in your heart

Just trust yourself
Look ahead
Feel the motion growing
Love is where it's going
This is where our real journey starts

Down through the years
Throughout the stars
Ancient the dream
Future evolves

Shining light
Now in sight
Evolution Orange
Wondrous flight
Now in sight
Evolution Orange

Patience
The healer and the giver

Patience will deliver
Fire from the spark

Just trust yourself
Reach inside
Have no hesitation
Give no explanation
You know who you are

Down through the years
Throughout the stars
Ancient the dream
Future evolves

Shining light
Now in sight
Evolution Orange

Wondrous flight
Now in sight
Evolution Orange
