Face to face, I can see that look in your eye
But are you looking at me
Cause you know things aren't what they seem to be
Does it matter to you
Or have you played that game before
I can feel you across the room
I wanna know just what it takes
Cause you know that I've made some mistakes
I've been down that rood before
Don't want to feel like a wolf when I'm
Banging on your door

So, break it to me gentiy all night long
Break it to me gently or prove me wrong
Take me to the point of no return, oh yeah
Break it to me gently all night long
All night long

So tell me if I'm wrong
But wasn't it you that gave up
Without a fight, last night
So tell me if I'm reading you right
That's when I felt that there was something going on
And now I know what I wanna see

When you walk that way
Do you walk that way for me
Gotta know
Or are you just putting on a show
Cause you're everything I want
And a little bit more

Break it to me gently all night long
Break it to me gently or prove me wrong
Take me to the point of no return, oh yeah
Break it to me gently all night long

So break it baby

Here we go
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh, oh oh, oh oh

Break it to me gently all night long
Break it to me gently or prove me wrong
Take me to the point of no return, oh yeah
Break it to me gentry all night long
Break it to me gently all night long
Break it to me gently or prove me wrong
Take me to the point of no return, oh yeah
Break it to me gently all night long

All night
