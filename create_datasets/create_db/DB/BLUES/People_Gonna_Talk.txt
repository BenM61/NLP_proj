You can carry my heart with you
Or you can drop it like a stone
But please let that decision be your own

I know people gonna talk
The way they do sometimes
But don't let them change your mind

I can wait around forever
If it has to be that long
Just as long as it's you I'm waiting on

They can tell you that it's over
And I'd better step aside
But nobody but you can decide
