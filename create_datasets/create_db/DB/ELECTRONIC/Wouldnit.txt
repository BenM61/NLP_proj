Wouldn't it be nice to be a heroine?
Cool and slinky with an appropriate smile
Honey, I take sugar, two
While he's ranting and raving

Could you pass that cream?
I was looking to have a cupa tea
Instead I freeze

Seeing his next move, is it grabbing my hair?
Or bushing my tush
Till there's no scream left?
Wouldn't it be nice to be a heroine?

Wouldnit, wouldnit?
Wouldnit, wouldnit?
Wouldnit, wouldnit?
Wouldnit?

Mmm

Wouldn't it be nice to be a hero?
Standing fast and easy with an appropriate grin
Brother, not that way, they'll take you away
Mmm, give me your gun

It's no use to anyone
Instead I freeze

Seeing if I shut up and stay real still
Maybe he won't kill
At least not me
Wouldn't it be nice to be a hero?

Wouldnit, wouldnit?
Wouldnit, wouldnit?
Wouldnit, wouldnit?
Wouldnit?

Mmm

Wouldn't it be nice to be a star?
Shinin' and sparklin', looking down the whole and plenty
Being looked up with a telescope
While my sisters busy cutting the rope

Daddy, you can't touch me
Mommy, you can't hate me
I'm a star, get it?
Instead I froze

And I let them, I let them
I let them pick my brain
Twist my arm, cut my throat
And wish me dead

But I'm still thinking
Wouldn't it be nice to be a star?

Wouldnit, wouldnit?
Wouldnit, wouldnit?
Wouldnit, wouldnit?
Wouldnit?
