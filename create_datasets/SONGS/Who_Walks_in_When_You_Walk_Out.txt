Who walks in when I walk out?
And who gives you that, "Hi, baby"?
Who's it who got me jealous of you?

Who walks in when I walk out?
Now, don't you know you're my baby
Who's it who got me worrying too?

Now when we kiss, I kinda miss
Something that used to be
Everyday while I'm away
I got a feeling that you're fooling me

Oh, who walks in when I walk out?
Who gives you that, "Hi, baby"?
Who's it who got me jealous of you?

When we kiss, I kinda miss
Something that used to be
Everyday while I'm away
I get that feeling you're fooling me

Who walks in when I walk out?
Who gives you that, "Hi, baby"?
Who's it who got me jealous of you
Got me jealous of you?
