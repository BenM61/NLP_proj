I am the tragedy 
And the heroine 
I am lost And I am rescuing 

The storm is come 
And I am following 

My name is Tristan 
And I am alive 

Forever young 
I come from God knows where 
Because now I'm here 
Without a hope or care 

I am trouble 
And I am troubled too 

My name is Tristan 
And I am alive 

Sorrow by name 
And sorrow by nature 
Working for joy 
On overtime 

Stuck on a line 
Of misadventure 
I fear no crime 

I am the victim 
And the murderer 
You speak of love 
But I've never heard of her 

I am fucked 
And I am fucking too 

My name is Tristan 
And I am alive
