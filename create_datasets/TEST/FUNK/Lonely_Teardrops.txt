(Shoo bee doo bop, bop, bow)
(Shoo bee doo bop, bop, bow)
(Shoo bee doo bop, bop, bow)

My heart is crying, crying
Lonely teardrops
My pillow's never dry of lonely teardrops
Come home, come home
Just say you will, say you will
(Say you will) say you will (say you will)
Hey, hey (say you will)
My heart is crying, crying

Lonely teardrops
My pillow's never dry of lonely teardrops
Come home, come home
Just say you will, say you will
(Say you will) say you will (say you will)
Hey, hey (say you will)

Just give me another chance for our romance
Come on and tell me that one day you'll return
'Cause, every day that you've been gone away
You know my heart does nothing but burn, crying

Lonely teardrops
My pillow's never dry of lonely teardrops
Come home, come home
Just say you will, say you will
(Say you will) say you will (say you will)
Hey, hey (say you will)
Say it right now, baby
(Say you will) come on, come on
(Say you will) say that you
Say it right now, baby
(Say you will) come on, come on
(Say you will) hey come on
