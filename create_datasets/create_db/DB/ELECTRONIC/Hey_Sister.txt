Hey sister
Hey sister
Could you come a little closer?
Feel like my brain is spilling over
Do I seem a little strange to you?

Hey sister
Hey sister
Can you see all the colours?
Are they breathing to each other?
Maybe I can breathe in to you

My senses are running around
Just keep tumbling around
There's something my body has found
That my body has found

(Hey sister, hey sister)
A deep and undiscovered hunger
(My brain is spilling over)
Undiscovered hunger
(Hey sister, hey sister)
My senses are running around
(My brain is spilling over)
That my body has found

You've been running through my blood
Pulsing through my blood in waves
Something running through my blood
I understand it in my fingertips
