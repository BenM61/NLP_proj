I'm addicted to feeling, stealing love isn't stealing
Can't you see that I understand your mind?
I'm a walking believer, I'm a ghost and a healer
I'm the shape of the hole inside your heart

Not looking for a brighter side
Crooked steps will take me higher
I don't care if you want to cry

I'm a soldier for hire killing all you admire
And you live in denial but that will change, hey

Not looking for a brighter side
Crooked steps will take me higher
I don't care if you want to cry

When blood is raining down, it cuts a deep deep river, yeah
And we're diving, yeah, we're diving

My crooked steps right behind you (Right behind you)
My crooked steps right behind you (Right behind you)
My crooked steps right behind you (Right behind you)
My crooked steps right behind you (Right behind you)

I'm a walking believer, I'm a ghost and a healer
Can't you see that I understand your mind?
Can't you see that I understand your mind?

My crooked steps right behind you
My crooked steps right behind you
My crooked steps right behind you
My crooked steps right behind you
My crooked steps right behind you
Right behind you, right behind you, right behind you
