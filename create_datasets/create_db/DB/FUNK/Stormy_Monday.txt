Call it stormy Monday
Lord, but Tuesday's just as bad
You know they call it stormy Monday
Lord, but Tuesday's just as bad
And Wednesday's are worse
And Thursday's oh so sad

The eagle flies on Friday
Lord, and Saturday we go out and play
The eagle flies on Friday
Well, Lord, and Saturday we go out an play
Uh-huh-huh

And Sunday we go to church
And I kneel down and pray
And this is what I say:

Look, Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy on me
I do
I cry Lord have mercy
Lord, have mercy on me, on me, um
You know I'm tryin', tryin' to find my baby
Won't somebody please send her on home to me?
Oh Lord
