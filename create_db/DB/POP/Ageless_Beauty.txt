Ageless beauty
Cruelty makes its holes
But on the shoreline
Time will hold its promise

We will always be a light
You can see it from the surface, see it
We will always be a light
You can see it from the surface, see it
We will always be a light

Tattered fingers
Lingering on the warm and foolish
Hardened faces
Graceless, we'll lose the battle

We will always be a light
You can see it from the surface, see it
We will always be a light
You can see it from the surface, see it
We will always be a light

Oceans won't freeze
So loosen your heart
Underestimated
Undefeated in this love

We will always be a light
You can see it from the surface, see it
We will always be a light
You can see it from the surface, see it
We will always be a light
You can see it from the surface, see it
We will always be a light
You can see it from the surface, see it
We will always be a light
You can see it from the surface, see it
We will always be a light
