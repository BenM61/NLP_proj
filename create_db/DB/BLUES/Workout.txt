Between working and schooling, I'm always on the run
Come on little baby, let's have a little fun
Workout, do you like it like this? Workout, do the soul twist
Work it out pretty baby, you know you got it working on me

I can't stand to see you darling wearing a frown
Come on baby let your hair fall down
Workout, do you like it like this? Workout, do the soul twist
Work it out pretty baby, you know you got it working on me, yeah

I gotta get going, not a minute to waste
Just looking at my baby puts a smile on my face
Everywhere we go, she makes the men a disgrace
They can't help it when the band?s really rocking the place
She's a fine little girl, the best in the world
Workout, workout, you know you got it working on me babe

When I go driving with my girl, I'm always there late
She just laughs when I say, sorry to make you wait
She don't ever mess, she knows I'm the best
It takes two full hours to get looking this great
Woo! Do you like it like this? Workout, do the soul twist
Work it out pretty baby, you know you got it working on me

When she's really ready, she's a sight to see
The women go running like cats up a tree
All the fellas line up one two three
But she's saving all her mighty good loving for me
She's a fine little girl, the best in the world
Workout, workout, you know you got it working on me
