Yeah 

You are my favorite lady 
And you know you are my favorite man, yes, you are 
And I know thats right 
Said it feels good to know that you feel the same 

And forever and a day 
Together we will be 
Nothing on this earth 
Could ever take you away from me 

Cause Ive been kissed 
But I never knew love like this 
And Ive been missed 
But I never knew love like this 

Loved someone before 
But I never knew love like this 
I had lots of lovin 
But I never knew love like this 

 Hmm... 
And you know youre something special too 
I love you 
And thats all I need to hear to make my day 

Cause youre always on my mind 
No matter what I do 
Nothing on this earth 
Could ever keep me away from you 

Ive been kissed 
But I never knew love like this 
And Ive been missed 
But I never knew love like this 

Loved someone before 
But I never knew love like this 
I had lots of lovin 
But I never knew love like this 

Oh, Ive been kissed 
Never knew love like this 
And Ive been missed 
But I never knew love like this 

Loved someone before 
But I never knew love like this 
No, I never, never, never, never 
Never knew love like this 

When Im asleep at night 
I dream I hold you tight 
I never had a better love 
Never love like this 

Oh...oh...ah... 
Ooh... 
No, I never knew love 

Ive been kissed, baby, yeah...oh... 
Never knew love like this 
And Ive been missed, girl 
Never knew love like this 

Never knew love, loved someone before 
Never knew love like this 
But I never knew love 
I never knew love, love like this, baby 

Ive been kissed, baby 
Never knew love like this 
And I surely missed, lets sing it together 
Never knew lov...
