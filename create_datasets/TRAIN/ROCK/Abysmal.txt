The world has turned and left me here
Alone with nothing but my fears
I feel the stiff of age it cracks
Mirror reflects just what I lack

I am standing here dying to be
To mean anything to anyone but me
I am naked now bereft of life's meaning
I am a shadow of what was

Plummet to sunken depths
There will be nothing left
Secrets of my being are being from me kept

There will be no resolve
For this wreck of nerves
Cheers to the axe that falls to the end
that I deserve

I am standing here dying to be
To mean anything to anyone but me
I am naked now bereft of life's meaning
I am a shadow of what was

A shadow of what was

You are dead to me
I am dead to me
My pulse has stopped you see
The butcher's waiting meat
And for eternity
As Satan laughs
we'll burn together
and scream abysmally

The work has turned and left me here
Alone with nothing but my fears
I feel the stiff of age it cracks
Reflects just what I lack

I am alone
I live alone
I'll die alone
Beneath a nameless stone

I am standing here dying to be
To mean anything to anything but me
I am naked now bereft of life's meaning
I am a shadow of was

I'll try this noose on just because
Signed your friend, abysmally
