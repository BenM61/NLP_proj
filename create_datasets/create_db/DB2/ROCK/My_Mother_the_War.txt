She borders the pavement 
Flanks avenues 
The parades pass 
White glove attended by 

My mother the war 

She'll raise a shaft 
Lift a banner 
Toss a rose 

My mother the war 

She knows every neighbor 
Chats at their doors 
Compare 
Econosize electric appliances 
Come share tea 
And a seat by my 
Cradle with 

My mother the war 

Forsaken vigil 
Three years each tour 
Hands of God enfold him 
Prayed mother of the war 
Haunt a doorway 
Beg a postman 
Is there word 
For mother the war 

5 black stars 

In bitter defiance 
She's spitting the corps 
Wet a brood 
Short league for combat 

My mother the war 

Well acquainted 
With sorrow 
With grief 

My mother the war 

Folded lace 
Carrion and 
Blood soaked robes 
Folded lace 
Carrion 
Blood soaked 
Shroud 

My mother the war
