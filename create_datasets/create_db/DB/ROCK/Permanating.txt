Somewhere on the highway
With a luminous moon
Swimming after dark and then
Awaken to you

Hold on
Hold onto the minute
And sing it
And live it
It's always there

Hold on
Hold onto the minute
And feel it
Believe it

And time is moving on
And listenening to the song
We get older
Together

And every time we breathe
Another moment leaves us forever
To the nether

Hold on
Hold onto the minute
And sing it
And live it
It's always there

Hold on
Hold onto the minute
And feel it
Believe it

Permanating
Celebrating
Now we're levitating
High above the clouds
Yesterday
Is the place where all your friends will always

Permanating
Celebrating
Now we're levitating
High above the clouds
Yesterday
Is the place where all your dreams are always

And time is moving on
And listenening to the song
We get older
Together

And every time we breathe
Another moment leaves us forever
To the nether

Hold on
Hold onto the minute
And sing it
And live it
It's always there

Hold on
Hold onto the minute
And feel it
Believe it

Permanating
Celebrating
Now we're levitating
High above the clouds
Yesterday
Is the place where all your friends will always

Permanating
Celebrating
Now we're levitating
High above the clouds
Yesterday
Is the place where all your dreams are always

Hold on
Hold onto the minute
And sing it
And live it
It's always there

Hold on
Hold onto the minute
And feel it
Believe it

Hold on
Hold onto the minute
And sing it
And live it
It's always there

Hold on
Hold onto the minute
And feel it
Believe it
