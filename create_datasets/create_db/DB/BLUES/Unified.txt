It could be so nice but the world is not ready, yeah
It could be so nice but the world is not ready yo

Weather you're a black man
Or you're a white man
Or your from England or from Japan
Or you're from China or you're and American
You're from the Middle East or you're and African

Well it could be so nice but the world is not ready, yeah
It could be so nice but the world is not ready yo

Now come on everyone on this place come together
Wouldn't it be nice if we could all live together forever
Finding our peace in unity
Destroying the notion of foolish vanities
Pull to rise
Lift the blinds
The funky dope is here in 1999
And we're praising so we're raising out of this oblivion
And on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on

You can't stop this with your mind tricks
Like Neo in the matrix I'm chosen
Uplift with the gift
Like Gandalf the wizard
I conjure a blizzard of magic to ride it high
Unified unified unified
Unified unified unified

It could be so nice but the world is not ready, yeah
It could be so nice but the world is not ready yo

They don't want it in their government
They don't want it with their politricks
They don't want it with their brainwash
They don't want it with their money fix
Unified unified unified
Unified unified unified
I want it want it want it want it

It could be so nice but the world is not ready, yeah
It could be so nice but the world is not ready yo
