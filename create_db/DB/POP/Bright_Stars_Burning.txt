Don't rely on things you read on highway signs or magazines
Mine's the only word you need
To understand what love can mean

After all these years you are leaving here
Despite what should be otherwise
In our future dear, so long as you're near
I'll follow 'til the sun won't rise

Summer skies don't shine the same
Winter cold won't numb the pain
But autumn air has filled my lungs
Enough to follow you for months

After all these years you are leaving here
DesWite what should be otherwise
In our future dear, so long as you're near
I'll follow 'til the sun won't rise

When I go so far, you leave me in the dark
I just want to be your light
If you never meant to make it from the start
Why'd we ever mean to try
Why'd we ever mean to try

You can go back home
But I'll never let go
You can just walk away
I won't leave you alone
Under bright stars burning
We will make our own ending
Under bright stars burning
We will make our own ending
