Lovin' you it seemed to me
Is everything that it should be
Lovin' you the way I do
Should be gritty clear to you

You've got a thang for me
Even the blind could see
Something you got, you can't beat it - no

Well, girl, I need it - girl, I need it 
That thang - that thang
Girl, girl, I need it - girl, I need it 
That thang - that thang
Baby, babe, I need it - I need it 
Oh yeah - oh yeah
Babe, babe, I need it 

Something you got weakens me
I give in like 1-2-3
Sometime I do somethin' wrong
We hug and kiss and it's all gone
Ain't that cold

You've got a thang for me
Even the blind could see
Something you got, can't beat it - no

No, that's why girl, I need it - girl, I need it 
Yeh-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo - eh-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo
I need it 
That thang - that thang 
That thang - that thang 
Girl, I need it - I need it 
That thang - that thang - that thang
Girl, I need it - girl, I need it - ow 

Got to tell it like it is
Love will last a million years
It sure did open up my nose
You kept the dose so it can't goes

You've got a thang for me
Even the blind could see
Something you got, you sure can't beat it
