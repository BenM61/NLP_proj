In your life x8 
In your life 
Like sitting on a ferris wheel 
Watching the world go around and around it goes 
Maybe that's how lovers feel 
Up and down, where it stops nobody knows 
How many tears 
or How many broken hearts 
Just how many sorrows 
How much you'll take 
In your life 
In your life 
In your life 
In your life 
In your life 
In your life 
In your life 
In your life 

Nobody knows, ole ole ole ola 
Lonely heart of a little boy 
Waiting for his daddy with a brand new toy 
Lonely eyes of a pretty little girl 
Bet 
How many tears 
or How many broken hearts 
Just how many sorrows 
How much you'll take 
In your life 
In your life
In your life 
In your life 
In your life 
In your life 
In your life 
In your life 

Nobody knows, ole ole ole ola 
In your life 
No body knows, ole ole ole ola 
For god so loved the world 
He gave his only begotten son 
That who so ever believed in him 
Shall not perish 
But have everlasting life 
No body knows 
I know I could be in your life 
Forever in your life 
I know I should be by your side 
Forever in your life 
Cause this is what it all comes down to 
In your life 
This is what it all comes down to 
In your life 
In your life
In your life 
In your life 
In your life 
In your life 
In your life 
In your life 
No body knows, ole ole ole ola 
In your life 
No body knows, ole ole ole ola 
No body knows, ole ole ole ola 
In your life 
No body knows, ole ole ole ola
