[Chorus: Rah Digga]
Flipmode the Imperial
You know you love it when you hear us on the radio
Go cop the joint and play the s*** up in your stereo
or in the streets up in your Jeeps or in the disco
And if you want the fly s***, my n**** here we go
You know it's Digga lookin pretty in the video
With Bus-a-Bus up in the cut but you don't hear me though
Just when you think we done we hit why'all we got plenty mo'
Blow!

[Rah Digga]
It be's the little mama, lip gloss and eyeliner
The only s*** poppin like White Castle or the Donna
Rah Digga make the joints that the DJs blast
Ghetto diva in the Source with the 3 page ad

Watch as the hood rat messiah climb swiftly
Labels scarred to death to let their artist bomb with me
'Cause you can send your thuggest MC and watch me son 'em
The ruggedest b****, don't even rhyme about gunnin

Got joints circulating like them old karate flicks
Buncha Rah Digga shirts on some big body chicks
Throw my s*** in your hoopty or your luxury trucks
And make the quickest turn around like 'dro for 20 bucks

And I'll still be the greatest if this rap s*** fail me
Back to jackin bootleg flicks from out the deli
Livin off the interest
Sippin on Tequila with my logo on the side of f***in 18 wheelers

[Chorus]

[Busta Rhymes]
Ay yo yo yo
Raze and dazzle n****s like ya'll
Spread n****s like you and dismantle n****s like why'all
I got the thing that'll majorly handle n****s like why'all

Fight y'all, bust a semi and cancel n****s like why'all
I know some joke n****s who love to ha**le n****s like why'all
Talk, and fix and simply dance on n****s like why'all
Trample n****s like y'all

Make examples outta n****s like y'all
Grit their teeth and c*** the hammer up inside the dance hall
Thugs, here's another sample for n****s like ya'll
Or for the ones who pa** and light a roman candle for n****s like why'all

Fight for n****s like why'all
Grad the mic from motherf***ers like why'all
Blow the spot in the night for all my n****s like why'all
My get high n****s, I blaze for n****s like why'all

Stink the spot up with 'dro now spray the f***in Lysol
You know we be the ultimate
We f***in with some other s***
And when we hit y'all
Yes, we sit and watch y'all n****s ride the dick

[Chorus]

[Busta Rhymes]
Ah-yo, clap and slap up a n**** for talkin lotsa wack s***
While I roll around with the Harriet Thugman of this rap s***

[Rah Digga]
Black chick, with intellect, who want to match wits?
Write my own rhymes so can't no n**** tell me jack s*** 

[Busta Rhymes]
Master s***, Flipmode exclusive across the map and s***
Presenting the first lady of the squad so give me dap and s***

[Rah Digga]
Sayin' peace when you see me, play the role like Ally Sheedy
And I ain't gon' join ya cipher if the weed's too seedy

[Busta Rhymes]
Yo, make sure you see what we doing now, put on your binoculars
Then I gas ya like a paid latino down at Banco Popular

[Rah Digga]
Rah Digga underground and gon' always blow the spot for ya
Longest runnin s*** since the phantom of the opera

[Busta Rhymes]
Bus-a-Bus, going down as one of the greatest spoken philosophers
Holding a 12-shot semi with a little red dot for ya

[Rah Digga]
First and only female unmatched by anyone
Rip it from old school to the next millennium

[Chorus]
