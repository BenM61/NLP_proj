Scum Gang

Pop these niggas like a wheelie nigga, you a silly nigga
In the hood with them billy niggas, and them hoover niggas
You run up and they shooting niggas, we ain't hooping nigga
Yo Gambi, you a loser nigga, up that Uzi nigga
On the stoop, crills in my draws, your girl on my phone
She wanna f*ck but keep her clothes on, I only want the jaw
Man that's really all I use her for, I kick her out the door
I don't want her, you can keep the whore, she fiending for some more
In New York my niggas don't Milly Rock, my niggas money bop
Blow a case a nigga throwing shots, I run 'em off they block
Quarter milli in the stash box, I grinded for my spot
Niggas talking 'bout that cash but my bag worth a lot
I don't f*ck with no old hoes, only new hoes
Put my dick in her backbone, I pass her to my bro
I don't love her that's a sad hoe, she a bad hoe
I'mma f*ck her then I dash home, to the cash hoe

I'm on some rob a nigga shit, take a nigga bitch
Do the dash in the whip, count the cash in the whip
I pull up with a stick, I let that shit hit
Shout out, but I fucked that nigga bitch

Niggas iffy, uh, Blicky got the stiffy, uh
Got the blicky, uh, drum it holds fifty, uh

Spinning through ya block like a pop shove it
Shoot at me I'm shooting back, I'm getting buckets

I'm on some rob a nigga shit, take a nigga bitch
Do the dash in the whip, count the cash in the whip
