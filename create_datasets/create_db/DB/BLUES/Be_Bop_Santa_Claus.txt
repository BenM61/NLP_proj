Twas the blight before christmas
and all through the dawn
the scene was quiet except pop and mom
there sat hung in their big easy chair
goofed on egg nog sherry and beer
ces and lil jr, lie there in the bed
whle visions of cadillacs jumped in their head
moms jumped up and said pops lets quit it to bed
then out on the stoop oweee such a clatter
pops fled to the porthole to see what was the matter
he did a jump and fell back
