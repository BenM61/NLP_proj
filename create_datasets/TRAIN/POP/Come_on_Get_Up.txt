Come on get up

Come on get up baby
Before you make me change my mind
Come on get up baby
So we can dance all through the night

I feel so free
Could it be
The way you're loving with me
Between the sheets
My mind was telling me
Now I see
The single life's for me

Never thought I'd be
This crazy for you baby
Gotta spell on me
It's who doo
Aw come and get me off
The way your body moves
It drives me damn baby
Now what I wanna see
Is you shake that ass for me so

Come on get up baby
Before you make me change my mind
Come on get up baby
So we can dance all through the night

I feel alive and this smile
Because you're on my mind
All the time
Sexually you please
Mentally
I like your style

Never thought I'd be
This crazy for you baby
Gotta spell on me
It's who doo
Aw come and get me off
The way your body moves
It drives me damn baby
Now what I wanna see
Is you shake that ass for me so

Come on get up baby
Before you make me change my mind
Come on get up baby
So we can dance all through the night
