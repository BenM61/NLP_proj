Never
Never stopped loving you
Never
Stopped loving you
Never
Stopped loving you
Done a lot of things
In my life 
And at times
I found the answers 
To some questions
That were heavy on my mind
Every fantasy
Ceased to be a mystery
To me
Done a lot of things
That I have lived to regret
But all the moves I made
Were not enough
To help me forget
In solitude I find
Your kiss stays on my mind
After all this time

(Chorus)
I never stopped loving you
I only did what I had to do
Though we've been 
So far apart
You kept your
Place in my heart
I never stopped loving you
Shared a part of me with you
I let you touch
That secret space 
Inside my hungry heart
That couldn't get enough
I just can't forget
What was so perfect

In you:
Your scent
Your touch
Your kiss
Your everything
Stays burned in my memory
And it keeps me yearning
To share some smiles again
Like we did back then
My old friend

(Chorus)

(Repeat Chorus)

And God only knows
Just how far I would go
To get back together
With you
Do you suppose we could bloom like a rose
When it's kissed
By early
Morning's dew
I ain't gonna do it
Cause I can't get through it, no
I never stopped loving you
Oh!
I, I never stopped loving you
I only did what I had to do
Oh, we've been
So far apart, hon
You kept your place in my heart
I never stopped loving you
Oh
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Oh, oooo
So far
Got a place
In my heart
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
