I tell myself that I don't love you
I tell myself that you're not good for me
Your eyes are green, grey, blue, whatever
But I don't look at them
And I don't look at you
I tell myself that I don't want you
I tell myself that you're not what you seem
And we could never be together
I'm just not into you
But I know that's a...

Lie lie lie
Like before before
Everyday I, I
Want you more more more
What'm I gonna do
What'm I gonna do
You are the one
It is you
You're the one, you're the one (It's you you you)

I tell myself that I don't need you
I'm unaware of who why what you are
The world it don't revolve around you
But you expect it to
Oh baby, wouldn't you?
I tell myself 
that I don't need another boy like you
You're the cause of all the stupid things that I do
And love, it just don't last forever
And I don't want it to
But I know that's a

Lie lie lie
Like before before
Everyday I, I
Want you more more more
What'm I gonna do
What'm I gonna do
You are the one
It is you
You're the one, you're the one (It's you you you)

You are the stars
You are the sun 
You are the earth
You are the one
All of this time I've not been true
Hiding the fact I wanted you

Lie lie lie
Like before before
Everyday I, I
Want you more more more
What'm I gonna do
What'm I gonna do
You are the one
It is you
You're the one, you're the one (It's you you you)
