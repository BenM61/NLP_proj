Come a little closer, I know what you need now
Come or I'll make you, and then I'll show you how

Cause baby you and me we are on our feet, no defeat smiling faces
Make this night the very last fight, the wildest life smiling faces

It's my happy violence,
Forcing us tonight it feels so right.
It's my happy violence,
Crashing into you, right into you.

Feel the pleasure, I make you wanna smile.
Feel or I'll make you, no need to question why

Cause baby you and me we are on our feet, no defeat smiling faces
Make this night the very last fight, the wildest life smiling faces

It's my happy violence,
Forcing us tonight it feels so right.
It's my happy violence,
Crashing into you, right into you.

It's my happy violence,
Forcing us tonight it feels so right.
It's my happy violence,
Crashing into you, right into you.
