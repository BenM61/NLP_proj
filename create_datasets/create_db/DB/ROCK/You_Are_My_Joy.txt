I won't leave you
Out of my will
But I will leave you out
Of my mind, for now

I won't be there to break
Your sweet heart
But not being there
Might break your sweet heart

You are my joy
You are my joy
You are my joy
You are my joy

You are my joy
You are my joy
You are my joy
You are my joy

If I could cradle you
Into my arms
I would cradle you
Tight in my arms, always

So don't be scared
Of all the hurtful words
'Cause in the end
They'll hurt themselves much more

You are my joy
You are my joy
You are my joy
You are my joy

You are my joy
You are my joy
You are my joy
You are my joy

You are my joy
You are my joy
You are my joy
You are my joy

You are my joy
You are my joy
You are my joy
You are my joy

You are my joy
You are my joy
You are my joy
You are my joy

You are my joy
You are my joy
You are my joy
You are my joy
