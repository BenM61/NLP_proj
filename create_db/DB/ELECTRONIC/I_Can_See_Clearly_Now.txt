I'm on fire, you're on fire
We're on fire, and that's cool
Piss on me, don't piss on me
My piss ain't free, and it's not cool

Cool, it ain't cool
Yeah it's cool, it ain't cool
Hey it's cool, it ain't cool, really cool

The king is dead, the queen is dead
The people said, hey it's cool
I'm nowhere man, no music man
No money man, but it's cool

Cool, hey it's cool
Yeah it's cool, really cool
Hey it's cool, really cool, hey it's cool

Sitting up on my mountain top
Sitting up on my mountain top
Sitting up on my mountain top
I can see clearly now
I can see clearly now
I can see clearly now

Blow up girl, throw up guy
They got height, and it was cool
Rock'n'roll, no rock'n'roll
Nowhere to go, but it was cool

I am sitting up on my mountain top
