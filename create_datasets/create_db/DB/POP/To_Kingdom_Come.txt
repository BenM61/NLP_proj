That's a frosty way to speak,
To tell me how to live next to your potpourri
All this talking pulls my teeth.
I believed in you, so you believed in

Me, I cried out God
You dared me in the dark
I felt a hush fall quietly from my spark
so now I hide in piles of princely orange peels
It feels the way you told me how it'd always feel

Once I had an name to call you.
It scraped along the walls like an orthodox saint.
I wish for the same old things that turn me inside out.
Hearing is a strain, it's a game!
Me, I cried out "God"
You dared me in the dark
I felt a hush fall quietly from my spark
so now I hide in piles of princely orange peels
It feels the way you told me how it'd always feel
Never have I ever been
Clutching at your hair to cure you of some sin,
But that's the kind of state I'm in:
Swimming in a pool of godly medicine.

Come, come, I hear it calling me, yelling,
Like if ever there was someone who could make things heavy again.
Feel alive!
