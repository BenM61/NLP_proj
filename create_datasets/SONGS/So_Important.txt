Begging isn't easy
It kills your self-esteem
Makes you feel dependent
It makes you feel mean
But subtlety is useless
In breaking down a wall
And subtlety is toothless
You'd rather see me crawl
So if it takes a flashy display
To make you warm up, OK

Because you're so important to me
So important to me
So important to me
Right now

This discrimination
It's cruel and inhumane
If I had any pride left
I'd say you were insane
If only you would love me
Or just be less intense
It isn't that I'm ugly
It isn't that I'm dense
But if it takes a cheap, tawdry scene
To make you see what I mean

Because you're so important to me
So important to me
So important to me
Right now
