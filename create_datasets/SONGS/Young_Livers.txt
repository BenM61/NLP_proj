Working, another victim in the pot
Too many holes in your story, Jean's alright 
The run-around runs around and goes to the top 
Hot-wired hands, then make them pop 
Count down a riot is another no show 
Feed our heads and watch them blow 

Hey we're alright 
We're just lazy and out of sight 
The young livers rule tonight 

My hands were just untied 
So I'm using my fist to buy me time 
The run-around runs around and goes to the past
Maude, let the young livers pass 
We're so strong and we're so feared 
They're gonna look back and never knew we're here 

The run-around runs around and goes to the top 
Hot-wired hands, then make them pop 
Count down a riot is another no show 
Feed my head and watch it blow
