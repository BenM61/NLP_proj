Longing for the schoolyard 
Reaching for the scenes 
Reminded by the songs that will never disappear 
Random like the infants 
Outdated like the old 
Lying there in aimlessness listening to the cure 
Doing some rehearsal 
Exercising in the cold 
Lowering the standards 
For the six-string never rolled 
Whistling at the girls 
And saving for the fuel 
Making plans and knock knock knock on wood 

Play some rock 
Play some rock 
Please don't stop 
Coming home coming home 

Sentenced by our faults 
We were to make in time 
Pleasantly aware 
Of our solitude in mind 
Saved me from the boredom 
Of what we disavowed 
Encouraged by the sound 
That was the sweetest one of all 
Admiring your senses 
Infected by your tongue 
Defenseless I believed 
That we'd face anything to come 
You innocently told me 
You'd catch me when I fall 
And solemnly we'd knock knock knock on wood 

Play some rock 
Play some rock 
Please don't stop 
Coming home coming home
I'm not the only one
