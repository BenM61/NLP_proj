Tell her you're mine
That you have been blind
Tell her it's over
And you belong to me
Tell me to come
And like hell I will run
Back into your arms
'Cause you belong to me

There's a river on my skin
There's a dragon in the dark
Nothing scares me more
Than the silence of your heart

If you wanna hold me
If you wanna know me again
If you wanna love me
Than take me home
I've been at the bottom
The deep end of the ocean
Barely surviving by the dark side of her street
Tell her you belong to me

She'll never win
I'm not giving in
No matter how long
I still be hanging on
This kind of love
I'm not giving up
So tell her, tell her
Tell her you were fooling

Yeah
If you wanna hold me
If you wanna know me again
If you wanna love me
Just take me home
I've been at the bottom
The deep end of the ocean
Barely surviving by the dark side of her street
Tell her you belong to me
