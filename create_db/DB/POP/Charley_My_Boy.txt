Charley is an ordinary fellow 
To most everyone but Flo, his Flo 
She's convinced that Charley 
Is a very extraordinary beau, some beau 
And everything in the dim light 
She has a way of putting him right.

Charley by boy, oh Charley my boy 
You thrill me, you kill me with shiver of joy
You've got the kind of, sort of, wonderful ways 
That makes me, takes me, tell me what shall I say? 

When we dance I read in your glance 
Whole pages and ages of love and romance 
They tell me that Romeo was some lover too 
But boy he should have taken lessons from you 
You seem to start where others get through 
Oh Charley, my boy. 

Charley, my boy, oh Charley, my boy 
You thrill me, you kill me with shiver of joy 
You've got the kind of, sort of, wonderful ways 
That makes me , takes me, tell me what shall I say? 

When we dance I read in your glance 
Whole pages and ages of love and romance 
They tell me that Romeo was some lover too 
But boy he should have taken lessons from you
You seem to start where others get through, 
Oh Charley, my boy. 

And when we dance, I read in your glance 
Just oodles and noodles of love and romance 
I have a millionarie proposing to me 
I think I'll marry him, though he's eighty-three 
Think what wealthy widow I'll be 
Oh Charley, my boy.
