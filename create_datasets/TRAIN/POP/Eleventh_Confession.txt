Just promise me you wouldn't ever desert me
Tell me that you'd never willingly hurt me
What I'm gonna tell you will probably sting
So tell me to stop and I won't say a thing

I'm a dirty man
I went and I took a drink of dirty water
I'm a dirty man
I went and I took a drink of dirty water
Yes I did, yes I did

I needed to tell you I needed surrender
I never was good at playing pretender
It must be bad, you're just glaring at me
Now I'm just lost and I thought I was free

But I'm a dirty man
I went and I took a drink of dirty water
I'm a dirty man
I went and I took a drink of dirty water
Yes I did, yes I did
Oh baby yes I did, yes I did

Scream baby scream, boy your silence destroys me
Unlike your tears, they just used to annoy me
Bring down your thunder, I'm ready to shake
Sometimes I feel like it's all a mistake

I'm a dirty man
I went and I took a drink of dirty water
I'm a dirty man
I went and I took a drink of dirty water

I'm a dirty man
Yeah, I'm a dirty man
I'm a dirty man
Baby I'm a dirty man
