Forgive me if I seem to be 
Impatient and obscene
It's just I'd like to fall so flat 
And hear the voices shouting back

Tinkerbell should have waited 
Before turning on the TV show 
Tinkerbell should have waited 
Before turning on the TV show

As orange buffoons dance, 
They booked a faker in advance
Left purple jungles in a trance 
To raise the nepotistic chant

Tinkerbell should have waited 
Before turning on the TV show
Tinkerbell should have waited 
Before turning on the TV show

Tinkerbell should have waited 
Before turning on the TV show be	
She should have waited, 
She should have waited before the show

The TV show . . . the TV show
The TV show . . . the TV show
(La la la la la la)
So you want to be a star? 

Tell the monkey where you are, 
look the monkey in the eye
(the TV show . . . the TV show) 
Did you fly into a rage? 

Did you lust for centre stage? 
Look the monkey in the eye
(the TV show . . . the TV show) 
E G be	

Did you yearn to leave your mark? 
Did you swear that you'd go far? 
Look the monkey in the eye 
(The TV show . . . the TV show) 

E G be	
If you want to be a star tell the monkey 
Where you are, look the monkey in the eye
(The TV show . . . the TV show) 
E G be	

La la la la la la la la la la la la
