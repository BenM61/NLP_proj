Oh the air was shining
Shining like a wedding ring
Barbed like sex
I felt ten thousand volts
My chest was full of eels
Pushing through my usual skin
I opened up new wounds
Pouting, shouting

Oh love, like liquid falling
Falling in cascades
Oh lovelorn victims
Laughing in cascades

The sun was rich
Rich with a song of sin
My breath melted my words
Into strange alphabets
Tormenting my tongue
Pouting, shouting 

Oh love, like liquid falling
Falling in cascades
Oh lovelorn victims
Laughing in cascades

The heartbeats were echoing
Echoing the revolver
Emptying into my mouth
I pulled a face from my pocket
And smiled a leper's grin
I felt somebody close
Pouting, shouting 

Oh love, like liquid falling
Falling in cascades
Oh lovelorn victims
Laughing in cascades
