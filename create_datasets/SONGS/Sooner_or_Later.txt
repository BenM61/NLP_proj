These past days and past nights
Walks under streetlights
Something don't feel right
Sooner or later she'll be
Trips to Chicago
Don't call me crazy, this time tomorrow
You lead me, I'll follow
I got the tables, I bought the bottles

Sooner or later she'll
Be walking away, I got something to say to her
Sooner or later she'll
See what's inside, I've put something away for her
Man, I'd do anything for her
Sooner or later she'll be

(She'll be)
(She'll be)
(She'll be)
(Sooner or later she'll be)
(She'll be)
(She'll be)
(She'll be)
(Sooner or later she'll be)

I ain't pulling you back
When you feeling like that
I ain't tripping, getting mad
'Cause sooner or later she'll be
Coming right back
When you feeling like that
I ain't tripping, getting mad
Sooner or later she'll be

Sooner or later
Sooner or later

Tell me, I'm not sure
Don't tell me I'm not yours
I stop moving backwards
But sooner or later we'll be
Jets over oceans
I need your body on me like lotion
'Cause a commotion
Worship your body, call that devotion

Sooner or later she'll
Call me and tell me she's feeling alone tonight
Sooner or later she'll
Text me and tell me that she's leaving on the light
Guess I'm not going home tonight
Sooner or later she'll be

(She'll be)
(She'll be)
(She'll be)
(Sooner or later she'll be)
(She'll be)
(She'll be)
(She'll be)
(Sooner or later she'll be)

I ain't pulling you back
When you feeling like that
I ain't tripping, getting mad
'Cause sooner or later she'll be
Coming right back
When you feeling like that
I ain't tripping, getting mad
'Cause sooner or later she'll be

Sooner or later
Sooner or later
