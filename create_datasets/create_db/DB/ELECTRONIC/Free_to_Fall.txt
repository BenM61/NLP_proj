If I could right the wrongs
The past just wouldn't be
How could I fall in love at zero gravity?
And if I did make you love me
Will you make me belong?
And I'm waiting for the time
Like the calm before the storm

Oh no
You're not free to fall
Free to fall
Oh no
You're not
Not free to fall
Oh no
Oh no

This must be someone else
'Cause the part just isn't me
Can this be happening
'Cause it sounds like lines to me
First you're sailing
Then you're swimming
Then you're sinking in the sea of love
Still you sparkle and you sizzle
'Cause a live wire always does

Oh no
You're not free to fall
Free to fall

Within the atmosphere so rare
So rare
So rare
I can see my liquid love light fading
Fading
Draining
It's raining
Raining
And if I did make you love me
What did I do wrong?
And I'm waiting
Waiting
Like the calm before the storm

Oh no
You're not free to fall
Free to fall
