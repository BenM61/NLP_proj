Come on

You can feel her coming, coming at you
She, she's staying on you
You know she's coming at you
To resist her seems impossible
You can't do it, no you can't do it, no you can't do it

Hey lady what you say
How about some fun today?
Is it yes? Is it no?
Whatever it is just let me know
Don't fake me out, out
Oh, you make me shout

Alligator woman, you don't care
You ignore my desires, it ain't fair
You just want to tease me and turn me on
I wish you would leave but I don't want to be alone, no

Hey, babe I love you so
You know I don't want to go
Even though you're real laid back
You're dressed in black
And your hair is laid back

Hey lady what you say
How about some fun today?
Is it yes? Is it no?
Whatever it is just let me know
Don't fake me out, out
Oh, you make me shout

Alligator woman, you don't care
You ignore my desires, it ain't fair
You just want to tease me and turn me on
I want you to go but I don't want to be alone, ho

You're a mess, I must confess
You make me hot, with what you've got
Your big behind, it makes me blind
Don't take me gross but you're the most

You're a mess, I must confess
You make me hot, with what you've got
Your big behind, it makes me blind
I must be gross

Aw girl, aw girl
Aw girl, aw girl

Alligator woman, you don't care
You ignore my desires, it ain't fair
You just want to tease me and turn me on
I don't want you to stay but I don't want to be alone, now

You're a mess, I must confess
You make me hot, with what you've got
Your big behind, it makes me blind
Don't take me gross but you're the most

You're a mess, I must confess
You make me hot, with what you've got
Your big behind, it makes me blind
I must be gross
