Sometimes in the evenings I start to get that feeling 
Like I'm empty inside 
I know I'm doin' good now but tonight I'm headed downtown 
Down by the riverside 

I sit underneath the freeway with an old friend from the old days 
And a bottle of wine 
He used to call me "Big Time", said he knew someday that I'd shine 
Said he'd seen all the signs 
He said

Keep yourself to yourself 
Keep your bedroll dry 
And boy you never can tell 
What the shadows hide 
Keep one eye on the ground 
Pick up whatever you find 
'Cause you've got no place to fall 
When your back's to the wall 

He's gettin' old and it's showin' so I asked him how it's goin' 
He said "I've seen better I guess 
I've been rained on, I've been frozen, but this here's the life I've chosen 
If it just wasn't for the loneliness"

Now this river suits me to a T. but if you're trying to raise a family 
This it ain't no place to be 
Hell there's a kid down by the dump there, ought to be in grade school somewhere 
Now he hangs out with me, now I told him

Keep yourself to yourself 
Keep your bedroll dry 
And boy you never can tell 
What the shadows hide 
Keep one eye on the ground 
Pick up whatever you find 
'Cause you've got no place to fall 
When your back's to the wall 

Well we finished off the bottle and I told him, 
"Joe I think I ought to be headed uptown
Well it was late, and I'd been drinkin', drivin' home I got to thinkin' 
'Bout what's been going down 

'Cause they're nervous down on Wall Street, but they're trying to keep it upbeat 
Or maybe they just don't care 
Down at the river eyes are burnin' cause they feel the tables turnin' 
So if you wind up down there

Just keep yourself to yourself 
Keep your bedroll dry 
And boy you never can tell 
What the shadows hide 
Keep one eye on the ground 
Pick up whatever you find 
'Cause you've got no place to fall 
When your back's to the wall
