The Dipsy Doodle is the thing to beware
The Dipsy Doodle will get in your hair
And if it gets you, it couldn't be worse
The things you say will come out in reverse
Like "You love I and me love you"
That's the way the Dipsy Doodle works

The Dipsy Doodle is easy to find
It's almost always in back of your mind
You never know it until it's too late
And then you're in such a terrible state
Like "The moon jumped over the cow, hey diddle"
That's the way the Dipsy Doodle works

When you think that you're crazy
You're the victim of the Dipsy Doodle
But it's not your mind that's hazy
It's your tongue that's at fault, not your noodle

You better listen and try to be good
And try to do all the things that you should
The Dipsy Doodle will get you some day
You'll think you're crazy, all the things that you say
Like "Rockin' not I and rollin' goodbye"
That's the way the Dipsy Doodle works

Well, when you think you're crazy
You're the victim of the Dipsy Doodle
But it's not your mind that's hazy
It's your tongue that's at fault, not your noodle

You better listen and try to be good
And try to do all the things that you should
The dipsy doodle will get you some day
You'll think you're crazy, all the things that you say
Like "Roll, rattle and shake alligator"
That's the way the Dipsy Doodle works
That's the way the Dipsy Doodle works
