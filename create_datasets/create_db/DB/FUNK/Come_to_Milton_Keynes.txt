May I walk you home tonight
On this fine and lovely night tonight
We'll walk past the luscious houses
Through rolling lawns and lovely flowers

Our nice new town where the curtains are drawn
Where hope is started and dreams can be borne

Let us share our insanity
Go mad together in Community
Boys on the corner looking for their supper
Boys 'round the green looking for some slaughter

We used to chase dreams, now we chase the dragon
Mine is the semi with the Union Jack on

In our paradise lost we'll be finding our sanity
In this paradise found we'll be losing our way
For a brave new day

May I slash my wrists tonight?
This fine Conservative night
I was looking for a job so I came to town
I easily adopt when the chips are down

I read the ad about the private schemes
I liked the idea but now I'm not so Keyne

[Incomprehensible]
[Incomprehensible]
God bless you all, God bless
