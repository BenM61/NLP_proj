Can't keep my eyes off you
Can't keep my mind on fast no ,n o
You said you feeling exclusive
And you said that you finely ready to live
So let's a step to the good life
And say the hell with the bad times
So keep 'it's gonna be a ham a f*ck '
Let's make a dumn for love
Let's fall now for love
Hands in the air like you just don't care
It's a celebration let's do it right now for love
If you read a story what will be told?
If you worry a statement
You'll be bond
Like we compete with the games and we hona for the broke
Ain't no need for a pinch cuz baby I'm with soul

So let's a step to the good life
And say the hell with the bad times
So keep 'it's gonna be a ham a f*ck '
Let's make a dumn for love
Let's fall now for love
Hands in the air like you just don't care
It's a celebration let's do it right now for love

Like we go across the sky baby our love is strong
Baby I'll do anything
Just sing with me
Together we fight

Let's make a pose for love
It's far for now, hands in the air
Hands in the air like you just don't care
It's a celebration let's do it right now for love
For love, for love, for love
