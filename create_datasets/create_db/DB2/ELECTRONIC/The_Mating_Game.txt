Dance with me across the ocean floor
Sail away to heaven's open doors

Step right up
You're the next contestant
In this sweet charade
Take a number
Wait while I twist your fate
On the mating game
Mating game

On the mating game
Mating game

Hold me close enough to drink my rose
The devil in my pocket turn to go
Sorry if you want it
You're in a daze
Tonight, I love you
But tomorrow go away

Step right up
Who's the next contestant
In this sweet charade
Take a number
Wait while I tease you say
On the mating game
The mating game
On the mating game
Mating game

The mating game
On the mating game (mating game)
The mating game (mating game)
On the mating game (mating game)
On the mating game
