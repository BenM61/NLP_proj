I remember how 
The sun came shining through the trees 
Made shadows on the road
I was driving home
The morning after with the taste of you 

Still on my tongue
You are my safely zone
I live and breathe in you
I'll never find a better love not in a minute
I'll never find a better love not in a minute

Never a better love never a better love
On the harbor bridge
The rain was gently falling down
On a lazy summer day

Your face appeared
There on my windscreen
You smiled and slipped away
You are my safetly zone

I live and breathe in you
I'll never find a better love not in a minute
I'll never find a better love not in a minute
Never a better love never a better love
