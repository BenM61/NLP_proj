Force of shackles binding with torment
Through their points in a laughing sky

For each birth an affliction so cruel

The grasping hands of fate

Ties that limit, blinding illusions
Lying image of false affections
From the cradle and beyond the grave
The jealous eyes of "God"

And for each star that guides your way
A hidden ruler, to keep untouched the tyrant's reign
So burn the world

Silent voices inducing oppression
Weakening thought forms through mind intrusion
Bereft of true will man must die
For all eternity

And for each star that guides his way
A hidden ruler, at war with all that serves our cause
So burn the world

A new day dawns, another mountain wall to climb
Burn the world, burn the world
A new day dawns, another mountain wall to find

Burn the world now with flames of rebellion
Rise to power through lawless dominion
In ashes the remains of man
Shall signal our revenge

And like each star that fell to bless the hidden bloodline
So forged the swords for the elect
Now burn the world
