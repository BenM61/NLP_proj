We're all tired of flying in second class baby, never ever navigating
Always have to be the one that's waiting for a number in line
We're all sick of, we're all sick of following that direction
And still, with your ??? pulling us around by the ???
Gonna make you realise why we should own our own airlines, gonna make you wave goodbye
We're all tired of, tired of flying in second class, can you feel this my brothers?
Havin' to wait for the process
We're all tired of flying in second class baby, never ever navigating
Always have to be the one that's waiting for a number in line
Gonna make you realise why we should own our own airlines, gonna make you wave goodbye
Gonna make you wave goodbye, now and forever
Gonna make you wave goodbye, cause we'll fly away, fly away
Gonna make you realise why we should own our own airlines, gonna make you wave goodbye
Gonna make you realise why we should fly our own airlines, gonna make you wave
It's ready, it's ready, it's ready, it's ready for you
