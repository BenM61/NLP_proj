The one good thing in my life
Has gone away, I don't know why
She's gone away, I don't know where
Somewhere I can't follow her

The one good thing didn't stay too long
My back was turned and she was gone

Good thing
Where have you gone
My good thing
You've been gone too long (good thing)

People say I should forget
New friend tomorrow
Don't get upset
People say she's doing fine
Mutual friends I see sometime

That's not what I want to hear
I wanna hear she wants me near

Good thing
Where have you gone
My good thing
You've been gone too long (good thing)
Good thing

Then one day she came back
I was so happy that I didn't act
Morning came into my room
Caught me dreaming like a fool

Good thing, my good thing
My my my my good thing
Where have you gone (good thing)
My good thing
My good thing (good thing)

Girl
Where have you gone
It's been so long
Good God girl
Good God girl
Good God girl
Good thing
Good God
Good God
