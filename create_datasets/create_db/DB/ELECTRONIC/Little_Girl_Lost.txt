I don't know why it is you scare me
I don't know why I feel afraid
When you're around I feel uncertain
And lose sight of the plans I've made

You've got a nerve to be demanding
When you have nothing to begin
And though you say your door
Is never open to the world
I envy those who you let in

Little girl lost, little girl lost
Little girl lost
Little girl lost, little girl lost
Little girl lost, lost little girl

The boys in town could do without you
Your mother's not sure who you are
And in the darkness I will hold you to your word
The only sound of passing car

Little girl lost, little girl lost
Little girl lost
Little girl lost, little girl lost
Little girl lost, lost little girl
Little girl

When you run for shelter
You don't feel the pain
You don't agree with all the good things
When they are around you

I believe today may be
The first time I've regarded you
With more and more
Passing admiration

Little girl lost, little girl lost
Little girl lost
Little girl lost, little girl lost
Little girl lost, lost little girl

Little girl lost, little girl lost
Little girl lost
