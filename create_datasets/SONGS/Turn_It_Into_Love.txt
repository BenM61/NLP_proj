Do you believe I'd let you down
Your jealous heart gave you the runaround
You couldn't see
That I would always be your friend

If you can look inside your heart
And understand what's tearing you apart
You gotta trust someone
Don't let hate get in the way

Just turn it into love
Turn it into love
And open up your heart and you'll
Never feel ashamed if you
Turn it, turn it, turn it into love

When all your other friends are gone
I'll still be here to help you carry on
If you have faith in me
Then I'll believe in you
You are the first thing on my mind
Do you believe I wouldn't have the time
I have to make you see
You can't push the pain on me

Just turn it into love
Turn it into love
And open up your heart and you'll
Never feel ashamed if you
Turn it, turn it, turn it into love
Just turn it into love
Just turn it into love
Just turn it into love
Just turn it into love

If you can look inside your heart
And understand what's tearing you apart
You gotta trust someone
Don't let hate get in the way

Just turn it into love
Turn it into love
And open up your heart and you'll
Never feel ashamed if you
Turn it, turn it, turn it into love
