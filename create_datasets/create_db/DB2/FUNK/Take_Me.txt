If you can't give your all
Don't want what you've got to spare
If you can't love me completely
Well, I don't need you to care

If you can't give your heart
Then I don't just want a piece of it
If I can't have your love just freely
What use is your pity to me?

Take me for life
Don't just take what you need
Always be mine
A minute is no use to me

If you can't give your kisses
Why should I shake your hand?
If you can't give your soul to me
Well, I don't need another friend
