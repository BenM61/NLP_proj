You know it's just a feelin'
A feelin' is a feelin'

A feelin' is a thin' you can be sure of
Even if it's singular or plural
No matter what kind or mood of

You only know the real true meanin'
You don't have to tell anybody what's keepin'
You in a way, whatever the day
Whether it stays or go away, no

A feelin' is a thin' you just can't finagle
It takes more than a rhyme or riddle
It's a matter of control over a lot or a little

Just keep in mind, real power is a virtue
Use it, you'll find you'll need no one to nurse you
When you pursue, you only accrue
What's comin' to you

It's true, it's true
It's true, it's true

Others will see you're a much better person
And it may seem they're just like a merchant
Cause you will have the gift they've been searchin' for
And much, much more, much more

A feelin' is
(A feelin' is)
A feelin' is
(A feelin' is)
A feelin' is

You know it's just a feelin'
A feelin' is a feelin'

A feelin', oh
(A feelin', oh, a feelin' is)
A feelin' is
(I said a feelin' is, I said a feelin' is)

A feelin' is
(Somethin' precious)
A feelin' is
(Somethin' special)
A feelin' is
(Ooh, remember this is a feelin')
(Never, never, never, never, never)

A feelin', oh
(A feelin', ooh)
A feelin' is

A feelin' is
A feelin' is
A feelin' is
(A feelin' is tender, warm, precious)

A feelin', oh
(Never turn your back on a feeling)
(Never, never, never, never, never, never)
A feelin' is
