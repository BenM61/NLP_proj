Looking for yesterday, most any day I spent with you,
One yesterday when I still had a laugh or two,
One dance to our favorite tune then to our favorite lane,
Who cares if there is no moon or we're drenched with rain.
Looking for yesterday, before you wrapped the sun in clouds,
One yesterday before I hid away in crowds,
My heart lives in misery, always a stone in its shoe,
Looking for yesterday and you.
