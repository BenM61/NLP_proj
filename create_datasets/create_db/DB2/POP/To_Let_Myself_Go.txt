To let myself go
To let myself flow
Is the only way of being

There's no use telling me
There's no use taking a step back
A step back for me

A Step
Back for me
A step
Back for me

To let myself go
To let myself flow
Is the only way of being

There's no use telling me
There's no use taking a step back
A step back for me

To let myself go
To let myself flow
Is the only way of being

There's no use telling me
There's no use taking a step back
A step back for me

(Back for me)

To let myself go
To let myself flow
Is the only way of being

There's no use telling me
There's no use taking a step back
A step back for me

To let myself go
To let myself flow
Is the only way of being

There's no use telling me
There's no use taking a step back
A step back for me
