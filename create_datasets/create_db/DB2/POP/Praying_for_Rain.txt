I been working these bone dry fields all day
While she stays on my mind
Since she left in '86
Nothing's worked out right
She married a man with some bottom land
Moved just down the road
I hear he's afraid he's losing her
And I'm afraid we won't

One man's praying for sunshine
One man's praying for rain
That man's trying to keep her love
This man needs her back again
What we want is different
But what we need's the same
Yeah one man's praying for sunshine
One man's praying for rain

If I'd only loved her right
She never would've left
And I wouldn't be here wishing
She was leaving someone else
I don't even know the man
Or mean him any harm
All I want is what I had
Back here in my arms

One man's praying for sunshine
One man's praying for rain
That man's trying to keep her love
This man needs her back again
What we want is different
But what we need's the same
Yeah one man's praying for sunshine
One man's praying for rain
