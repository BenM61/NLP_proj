I wear a smile, you ride the frown
Always do my best to get you upside down
When you're throwing shade, I rearrange the clouds
Got my head up but we're going south

Let me be the rose to tint your glass
Spray-paint the lawn to get a greener grass
I'll be your brightsider, 'cause all I wanna do is make you feel a little better
I'll be your cheerleader, with no allowance, baby, I'll be on the bleachers

Get up, get up tonight
I will be the one to show you your brightside
Get up, get up tonight
I will be the one to show you your brightside

To show you your brightside

If the nightmares come, I'll wake you up
I'll give you Lucky Charms and a sunny-side-up
When your streak runs out, I'll win you more
I'll be your four-leaf clover and a unicorn

Let me be the rose to tint your glass
Spray-paint the lawn to get a greener grass
I'll be your brightsider, 'cause all I wanna do is make you feel a little better
I'll be your cheerleader, with no allowance, baby, I'll be on the bleachers

Get up, get up tonight
I will be the one to show you your brightside
Get up, get up tonight
I will be the one to show you your brightside

To show you your brightside

When I'm down here
It can only get better
See it all clear
Well, at least we're together
Laying under the stars
Thinking 'bout who we are
Claiming 'bout all that we are gonna be
Laying under the stars
I know that it's dark
But let me show you the brightside

Get up, get up tonight
I will be the one to show you your brightside
Get up, get up tonight
I will be the one to show you your brightside

To show you your brightside
