Spend a lot of time tryin' to grow up
Guess I got a lot of growin' up to do
Used to tell me sit down, hey shut up
Guess they don't know what I was goin' through
But I've loved me some girls
And I've broken me some hearts
A cast in Nova in my own right
As I see here watching the sun coming up
I guess it's okay, yea its ok
To say good night
[Chorus]
Born reckless, born reckless
Born reckless (watch the family cry)
Cause I was born to be reckless
Till the day, I die

Well you know, I've been shoved around
Hey, but I've done my share of the shovin' too
I guess you get what you deserve
Yeah you get what's comin' to you
For the life of me, I don't understand
I don't understand, how I ever got you
Someone so warm to hold my hand
When this world has beat me back through
(*Repeat Chorus)
Well what I really want to say is
I guess I don't know, what it is I really want to say
Anyway the thing is, I'm just surprised
That you're still here with me today
'Cause I've lied and I've cheated
And I've spit in your face
I've taken from you exactly what I need
But I want you to know
There's no one to take your place
How can we embrace love, how can we make love
At such an high rate of speed
(*Repeat Chorus)
