(verse 1)
Played in Cincinnati
Wit my whole head nappy
Made a rally in the street
Wit nothin but a beat
Gotta grudge against a judge
Kick em out that seat
You are what you eat
So what you eatin
Same message to your mind
Be self defeatin
Sick n tired of bein sick
And tired of bein beaten
Saw em drop it like it
Was way too hot and too fast
For hip hop doo wop rock or bop
Ain't here to hurt you
Don't hang in them circles
Government ain't got me
Yet so y'all don't stop me
See a stampede of fake cats
Runnin from bill cosby
What does he gotta do wit you doin you?
Y'all know what?
Dj lord gimme that cut
Bring that beat back
That's what's up

(verse 2)
Feedback from truly
Freedblacks
Gotta think outta this
Box of hard knocks
Lined em up at fort knox
To die in iraq
You don't know I rock?
What you under a rock?
Old cats beggin us to bring that beat back
Each generation thinks
The next one is wack
Jumpstarted in the daze of crack
R&b reagan, daddy bush
Way the hell on back
Pray to god
Feel like I got a church in myself, good god uh
Can't get no help
I say again healthcare cutback
Sht is wack
Bring that beat back

(verse 3)
They say the youth don't matter
And the old don't mind
It takes a lotta spine
To build all them young minds

Some of us get ghetto at the wrong damn time
Album what? we just makin one at a time
To save another brother whose life on the line
A big shot to claim some rocks and shine
Signs of a soul gone solo
Robbed blind
A very small part of half the worlds crime
Runaway child blown by an old land mine
Little ones workin in diamond mines

So cats can say what's hers and what's mine
Diamonds is girls best friend
So whys he cryin

(verse 4)
See when y'all hear it get near it
And you recognize the lyrics
You trained to refrain
And you start to fear it
Escapism
Like today there ain't racism
Obviously y'all ain't see
Black folks on tv
Judgement calls
Made on behalf of you and me
Or you and I
Do or die
I say an I for an I
Dividin line
Got the poor people
Payin for crime
Corporations gettin paid off our jailtime
Now y'all can tell russell
Yes I knock the hustle
Cause 2 million in lockdown
Under federal muscle
Beyond the streets
These kids is always watchin
Watching some of these jerks when they go berserk
So I work
