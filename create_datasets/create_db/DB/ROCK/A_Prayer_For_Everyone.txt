Every child deserves love 
A safe place to run and play 
Every man deserves a chance 
To bring home a decent pay 
Every race is equal
Beloved in God's eyes 
When I see discrimination my soul cries 
Say a prayer for the lonely 
A prayer for the confused 
Say a prayer if you'd only 
For the secretly abused 
Say a prayer for the newborn 
With all the battles to be won 
Say a prayer for the tired and worn 
Say a prayer for everyone 

Walk a mile with a stranger 
Put yourself in his shoes 
Lend a hand to an old one 
Good will come to you 
In our heads were happy 
We go our merry way 
In our hearts were all afraid of our dying day 

Every child deserves love 
A safe place to run and play 
Every woman deserves a chance 
To bring home a decent pay
