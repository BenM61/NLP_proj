I love the look(s) of you, (and) the lure of you
The sweet of you, and the pure of you
The eyes, the arms, and the (that) mouth of you
The east, west, north, and the (that) south of you

I'd love to gain complete control of you
Handle even the heart and soul of you
Love at least a small percent of me do
'Cause (Because) I love all of you
