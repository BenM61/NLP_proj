To save my soul I can't get a date
Baby's got it tuned on channel eight 
Wyatt Earp and the Big Cheyenne 
Comin' thru the T.V. shootin' up the land

Mm hmm, my baby loves the Western movies
My baby loves the Western movies
Mm hmm, my baby loves the Western movies

I call baby on the telephone 
To tell her half of my head was gone 
I just got hit by a great big brick 
She says thanks for reminding me about that Maverick 

Mm hmm, my baby loves the Western movies
My baby loves the Western movies
Mm hmm, my baby (loves the Western movies)

Well there's Jeremy Roller and Old Cochise 
Jim Hardy, Jim Bowie and Sugarfoot
They all have gun, they all will travel 
Give me back my boots and saddle 

Mm hmm, my baby loves the Western movies
My baby loves the Western movies
Mm hmm, my baby loves the Western movies

Here's the story of the certain Wagon Train McCord ?
A broken arrow has broken my heart
Jefferson Thomas hit the sled till it's gone
Untied my baby and the fight was won 

Mm hmm, my baby loves the Western movies
My baby loves the Western movies
Mm hmm, my baby loves the Western movies
My baby loves the Western movies
