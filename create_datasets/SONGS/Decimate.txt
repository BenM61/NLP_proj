It's a pity little price to pay
To make the hard times go away
But I love you as you are

I say the words and then I'm not so sure
Exactly what we say them for
And this is my concern

But everybody needs a place to start
Oh, weightless be your heavy heart
And lean your thoughts on me

And ain't it hard to live on smoke and dreams
When spirit crushes working teams
To leave you where you are

You decimate my inhibitions
And I can't be saved
Let's take a walk out on the broken glass
Come on, come on, come on

You decimate my inhibitions
And I can't be saved
Lay all your worries on my back
Come on, come on, come on, come on

It's a pity little price to pay
To give a little self away
And lean your thoughts on me

It cannot be so hard to get along
Though history may prove me wrong
And it wouldn't be the first time

But everybody needs a place to start
Oh, weightless be your heavy heart
And lean your thoughts on me

And ain't it hard to live on smoke and dreams
When spirit crushes working teams
To leave you where you stand

You decimate my inhibitions
And I can't be saved
Let's take a walk out on the broken glass
Come on, come on, come on

You decimate my inhibitions
And I can't be saved
Lay all your worries on my back
Come on, come on

Hey, come on
Hey, come on

You decimate my inhibitions
I can't be saved
Let's take a walk out on the broken glass
Come on, come on, come on

You decimate my inhibitions
I can't be saved
Lay all your worries on my back
Come on, come on, come on, come on

You decimate my inhibitions
And I can't be saved
Let's take a walk out on the broken glass
Come on, come on, come on

You decimate my inhibitions
And I can't be saved
Lay all your worries on my back
Come on, come on, hey, come on
