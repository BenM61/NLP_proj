The morning clouds are gathering around as I stand on the bridge of the river
Years have gone since I was here and I wonder how I differ
Taxicabs keep rolling by and a blind man asks for change
And here I stand a soldier in the rain.

Coming home was all I thought of ... seeing my family and friends
They say love knows no distance but the lonely never ends
And all along the dreams that possessed my heart never were to plain
And here I stand a soldier in the rain

I remember years ago? I had so many plans
And now I watch the river flow ? time has brought me here
With empty hands
I remember years ago? I had so many plans

And now I watch the river flow? time has brought me here
With empty hands
The morning clouds are gathering around and the streets are full of reflections
A traffic light and the moon still bright ? people going in different directions

I've thought about why I'm here its just too hard to explain
And here I stand a soldier in the rain
