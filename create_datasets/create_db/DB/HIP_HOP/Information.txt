The information is ravenous
The ticker tape feeds the mind
Looking for a lost transmission
A heaven that we left behind

When the information comes
We'll know what we're made from
And the skyline rising
High-rise eyes see for you

Say hello to a mannequin
Ghost of our lonely tongue
Reaching out to someone
I was waiting down below

When the information comes
We'll know what we're made from
And the skyline rising
High-rise eyes see for you

She's the sister of Everless
A wife of a poisonous guy
She's the eye of a battle of stones
Seize where the Adam survives

When the information comes
We'll know what we're made from
The skyline rising
High-rise eyes see for you
