Crazy
I'm Crazy for feeling so lonely
I'm crazy
Crazy for feeling so blue

I knew
You'd love me as long as you wanted
And then someday
You'd leave me for somebody new

Worry
Why do I let myself worry?
Wonderin'
What in the world did I do?

Crazy
For thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for tryin' and crazy for cryin'
And I'm crazy, for lovin' you

I'm crazy for tryin' and crazy for cryin'
I'm crazy, for lovin' you
