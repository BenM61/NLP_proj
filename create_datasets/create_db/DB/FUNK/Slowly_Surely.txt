Slowly, surely, I'll walk away from
That old desperate and tainted love

Caught up in a maze of love, the crazy, crazy love
Thought it was good, thought it was real
Thought it was, but it wasn't love

I just don't know where I should go

So, slowly, surely, I'll walk away from
Self-serving, undeserving, 'constantly hurting me' love
Deserting me love, you said, I said, we said

But, slowly, surely, I'll walk away from
Confusing love, misusing love, abusing love
This can't be
Slowly, surely, I'll walk away from
Self-serving, undeserving, 'constantly hurting me' love

I just don't know where I should go, no
I just don't know, know, know, know
Where I should go

So, slowly, surely, I'll walk away from
That old desperate and dazed love

Caught up in the maze of love, the crazy craze of love
Thought it was good, thought it was real
Thought it was but it wasn't love

I just don't know where to go

So, slowly, surely, I'll walk away from
I'll walk away from
Slowly, surely, I'll walk away from love
Lonely, surely one step at a time
But surely, I will pass the old love aside
And love me

Slowly, surely, I'll walk away from
Slowly, surely, I'll walk away from desperating days love
Caught up in the maze love
Crazy, crazy, crazy love

Slowly surely, I'll walk away from
Slowly surely, I'll walk away from
Slowly surely, I'll walk away from
