Well hard times here baby, hard times everywhere I go
Lord hard times, baby, hard times everywhere I go
Now people keep cryin' 'bout hard times, 
They comin' more and more

Lord I can't even see what, poor people is gonna do
Lord I can't even see what poor people is going to do
They keep cryin' about these hard times 
And they coming more and more

Well went to the factory this mornin' 
Where I had worked ten years ago
Lord I went to the factory this mornin' 
Where I had worked ten years ago
And the bossman told me that 
They ain't hirin' in here no more

Well was a bluebird, baby, 
Had my trunk packed on my back
Lord if I was a bluebird, 
Had my trunk packed on my back
I'd fly away from this town, mama, 
Swear I would never come back.
