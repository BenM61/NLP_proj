What is there to say
When all the love has slipped away
In a half a minute
 
There is always something we can blame,
But in the end,it's just the same
Suddenly you'll find yourself alone
 
Half a minute
Half a minute
 
What is there to say
When every dream just fade away
In a half a minute
Every explanation we can find,
Will never change it,we are through
Suddenly you'll find yourself alone
 
Half a minute
Half a minute
 
Suddenly you'll find yourself alone
 
Half a minute
Half a minute
 
Half a minute
 
Half a minute
Half a minute
Half a minute
Half a minute
 
Half a minute
