You're like kissing lipstick.
You're pasty, warm, and dry.
You're boring.
You bore me.
You're such a boring guy.
At first I kind of liked it

The way it oozed out of your mouth

Then there was more and more and,
it got boring,
Just another boring lie

So what if I just picked this knife up
And cut you all across your smile,
Would that be boring?
Or just one less boring life.
