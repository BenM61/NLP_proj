I lost my sugar in Salt Lake City 
Oh, why did I go there 
I should have stayed down in New Orleans 
And never gone nowhere 

A girl with sweet talk from Kansas City 
Her words were sweet like wine 
She bought him diamonds and limousines 
She stole that man o' mine 

When night comes a-creepin' 
For me there's no sleeping 
What she sews, she'll be reapin' 
'Cause she done me wrong
 
I cried my heart out in Salt Lake City 
The day I heard the news 
He left me deep in my solitude 
With a Salt Lake City blues

With a Salt Lake City blues
