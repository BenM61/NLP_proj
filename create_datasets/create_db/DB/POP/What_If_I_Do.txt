I'm afraid were moving a little to fast 
He thinks were movin' to slow
I'm sittin' here praying this movie will last another hour or so.
He whispers he loves me he loves me so strong he wants to show me tonight.
When two people have wanted each other so long you know its only right
Ya tonight

What if I do will he love me more
What if I don't will he walk out the door
I want to wait till I know its true
He thinks I won't but what if I do

He's got my body screamin', screamin' lets go
He's got my mind all a mess
The part of me that always says no
Is losing to that part that says yes
It's a test!

What if I do will he love me more
What if I don't will he walk out the door
I want to wait till I know its true
He thinks I won't but what if I do

He says will be together from now until forever
Is he just being clever or what

What if I do will he love me more
What if I don't will he walk out the door
I want to wait till I know its true
He thinks I won't

He thinks I won't

What if I do will he love me more
What if I don't will he walk out the door
I want to wait till I know its true
He thinks I won't but what if I do

He thinks I won't but what if I do
