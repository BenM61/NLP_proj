Whistling over trestles
And past the graveyard sign
We cast our wayward line
Inside a wishing well

We've just a wish and an empty vessel
A hole to fill with days
On a road where children stray
Then pray there is no hell
And as for heaven, well

If seeing
If seeing is believing
I'll believe it
Believe it when I see it
I'll believe it when I see it
With my own two eyes

If seeing
If seeing is believing
I'll believe it
Believe it when I see it
I'll believe it when I see it
With my own two eyes

This ain't no random shuffle
There's reason in these rhymes
A season and a time
In a climate of fear and blood

In the tavern two men did scuffle
Their drunken battle moaned
They groaned like cattle groan
No diamonds here in the rough
And as for peace and love

If seeing
If seeing is believing
I'll believe it
Believe it when I see it
I'll believe it when I see it
With my own two eyes

If seeing
If seeing is believing
I'll believe it
Believe it when I see it
I'll believe it when I see it
With my own two eyes

And when faced with a difficult decision
Would you listen to your heart or mind
We're bound to waste all our free will and ambition
If we got no vision and we got no spine

And as for peace of mind

If seeing
If seeing is believing
I'll believe it
Believe it when I see it
I'll believe it when I see it
With my own two eyes

If seeing
If seeing is believing
I'll believe it
Believe it when I see it
I'll believe it when I see it
With my own two eyes

See it with my own two eyes
