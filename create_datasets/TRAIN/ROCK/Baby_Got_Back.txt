I like big butts and I can not lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face
You get sprung, want to pull up tough
'Cause you notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearing
I'm hooked and I can't stop staring
Oh baby, I want to get wit'cha
And take your picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But with that butt you got makes (me so horny)

So, fellas (Yeah) Fellas (Yeah)
Has your girlfriend got the back? (Hell yeah)
Tell 'em to shake it (Shake it) Shake it (Shake it)
Shake that healthy butt

Baby got back

Well I ain't down with that
So call some of your friends
And let's chill back in the Benz
Ey yo I gotta be straight when I say
I wanna uh till the break of day
'Cause shorty got it goin' on
A lot of suckers ain't like this song

So, ladies (yeah) Ladies (yeah)
