I found hope
In the back of a closet
Written by a child's hand
On pieces of parchment
Yellowed and old
I've never seen
That kind of belief

I sat to read
A story of kindness
Where even just one kiss
Can change how we read this
Can help us get lost
In a pattern so ageless
It conquers the cost

When did we all resolve to growing up means stand aside
Where did the heroes go 'cause tonight we breathe to stand and fight

We will run
Until we all can feel the sun
Until we all can bleed as one
Until we all collapse
We'll always live to close the distance
Run
Like it's time that's chasing us
Like you will never find enough
Like you forgot the words "give up"
And live to close the distance

Can you say
You remember a time when
All you had was a dream and
A promise to fight
When you were sure you were gone
When there wasn't the hope to carry on

Well in these days
We can live with a passion
We only deserve when
We cherish the burden
Of the brothers beside
When we carry the bones
That can't walk on their own

When did we all resolve to growing up means stand aside
Where did the heroes go 'cause tonight we breathe to stand and fight

We will run
Until we all can feel the sun
Until we all can bleed as one
Until we all collapse
We'll always live to close the distance
Run
Like it's time that's chasing us
Like you will never find enough
Like you forgot the words "give up"
And live to close the distance

When you say sing to me
I will sing like everyone is listening
Like current company
Thinks the words we speak right now mean everything
Like we all should feel the sun
Until we all can bleed as one
Until we all collapse
We'll always live to close the distance
Run
Like it's time that's chasing us
Like you will never find enough
Like you forgot the words "give up"
And live to close the distance
Close the distance
