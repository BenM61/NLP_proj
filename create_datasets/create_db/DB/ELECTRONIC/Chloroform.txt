I don't always tell the truth
They don't mind it if you're tall where I'm from
Anyone I find intrusive
You won't bother if you choose me

I don't only think of you
Eyes can tell I'm insecure; chloroform
I would rather stand if you stay
Why would I lie to you?

My love, my love, my love, my love is,
My love, my love, my love is,
My love, my love, my love, my love is,
Cruel

Buckle up, we'll chase each other
It's not a lot it's just enough to matter
Anyway you want the truth is
I will marry you on Tuesday

I don't always tell the truth
If you want it you could lose, don't bother
I don't like it if you miss me
Why would I long for you?

My love, my love, my love, my love is,
My love, my love, my love is,
My love, my love, my love, my love is,
Cruel

My love, my love, my love, my love is,
My love, my love, my love is,
My love, my love, my love, my love is,
Cruel

Would I long for you?
Is it up to you?
Is it up to you?
Ah ah ah ah
