One of these days the sky's gonna break
And everything will escape, and I'll know
One of these days the mountains are gonna fall
Into the sea, and they'll know

That you and I were made for this
I was made to taste your kiss
We were made to never fall away
Never fall away

One of these days letters are gonna fall
From the sky telling us all to go free
But until that day I'll find a way to let everybody know
That you're coming back, you're coming back for me

'Cause even though you left me here
I have nothing left to fear
These are only walls that hold me here
Hold me here, hold me here

One day soon I'll hold you like the sun holds the moon
And we will hear those planes overhead
And we won't have to be scared
We won't have to be, we won't have to be scared

You're coming back for me
You're coming back for me

You're coming back to me
