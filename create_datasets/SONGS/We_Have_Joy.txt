Idle toying, worship the whore, 
Forbidden was bidden, 
kiss turned to gnaw 
Indolent minds, broken rules 
The grey land is falling, 
Laugh at the fools 
We have Joy - We have Joy! 

We was drunk, intoxicate 
No time for doubt, no time, no late 
I saw the laughing one - this was the West 
he said "take your spear and puncture the flesh" 
We have Joy! - We have Joy! 

We was drunk, intoxicate 
No time for doubt, no time, no late 
Brandish the weapon, Sound out the din 
We feeling red now - time to move in 
We have Joy - We have Joy!
