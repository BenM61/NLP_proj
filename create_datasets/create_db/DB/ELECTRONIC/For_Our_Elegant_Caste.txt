We can do it soft-core if you want
But you should know I take it both ways
We can do it soft-core if you want
But you should know that I go both ways

Georgie said romantic love is flat
(Georgie said that)

Only for people with no real ambition in
Their lives (no lives)

But ooh, why does Christie disagree
She sees into the core of my poor machine
Ill tell you what she sees

Frightened cornered Gemini tactics and
In attempts to crack the party code
And there's one more thing

We can do it soft-core if you want
But you should know I take it both ways
We can do it soft-core if you want
But you should know that I go both ways

Our bodies became what has been him
So really turned off
Became a freaky permutation
Something like Voltron
Then I was wrapped in discourse with the magazine reader
The mutual conclusion was
I'm not worth knowing because I'm probably dead
So I'm exposed but no solution

We can do it soft-core if you want
But you should know I take it both ways
We can do it soft-core if you want
But you should know that I go both ways
