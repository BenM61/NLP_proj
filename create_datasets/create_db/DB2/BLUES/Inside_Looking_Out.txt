Sittin' here lonely like a broken man
 Sell my time and do the best I can 
 I wasn't boss this around in me
 But I don't want your sympathy, yeah
 Oh baby, oh baby, I just need your tender lovin'
 To keep me sane in this burnin' oven 
 When my time is up, be my reaper
 Like Adam's work on God's green earth
 My reaper, my reaper baby, yeah me is my reaper, yeah

 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, baby baby baby c'mon c'mon c'mon, yeah

 Ice cold waters runnin' in my brain
 And they drag me back to work again
 Pains and blisters on my minds and my hands
 From living daily with those canvas bags
 Thoughts of freedom their drivin' me wild
 And I'll by happy like a new born child
 We'll be together, girl, you wait and see
 No more walls to keep your love from me

 Yeah, can't you feel my love
 Baby, baby, need you, squeeze you, 
 Nobody but, nobody but, you girl, I love you, need you
 All right 

 I said everything's gonna be all right
 And if you don't believe what I say
 Just listen baby and I'll tell you
 Can't you feel my love 
 Can't you see my skill
 Can't you yell my love
 It's getting louder
 It's getting louder
 A little closer, yeah

 I said baby, I need you, c'mon, squeeze, please
 Lord, I love you, I need you, yeah
 Yeah, right by my side
 I need you here by my side
 But I can't help it baby
 But I'll be home soon
 I'll be home soon, yeah
 All right
 Whoa!!!
