I spotted that smile across your face 
From across the room 
My memory can't erase 
My heart exceeded its normal pace 
As oxygen takes a violent haste from my face 

Time and time again 
It's agreed that we are friends 
Then I awake 
Awake from my daydreams 
Sleeping all the time 
There was something on my mind 
Listen to my heart beats begin 

If you're single to mingle 
I'd love if we could do the town 
There's a love that could be found 
If your single to mingle 
I'd love if we could do the town 
There's a love that could be found 

When I lay me down to sleep 
I close my eyes and all I see is you 
Happy thoughts of us in a deep romance 
You and dancing close with our eyes in a trance 

Time and time again 
It's agreed that we are friends 
Then I awake 
Awake from my daydreams 
Sleeping all the time 
There was something on my mind 
Listen to my heart beats begin 

If you're single to mingle 
I'd love if we could do the town 
There's a love that could be found 
If your single to mingle 
I'd love if we could do the town 
There's a love that could be found
