Growing up it was just me and my mom
Against the world
And all my sympathies were with her
When I was a little girl
But now I've seen both my parents
Play out the hands that they were dealt
And as each year goes by
I know more about how my father must have felt

I just want you to understand
That I know what all the fighting was for
And I just want you to understand
That I'm not angry anymore
No, I'm not angry anymore

She taught me how to wage a cold war
With quiet charm
But I just want to walk
Through my life unarmed
To accept and just get by
Like my father learned to do
But without all the acceptance and getting by
That got my father through

I just want you to understand
That I know what all the fighting was for
And I just want you to understand
That I'm not angry anymore
No, I'm not angry anymore

Night falls like people into love
We generate our own light
To compensate
For the lack of light from above
Every time we fight
A cold wind blows our way

But we can learn like the trees
How to bend
How to sway and say

I, I think I understand
What all this fighting is for
And, baby, I just want you to understand
That I'm not angry anymore
No, I'm not angry anymore
