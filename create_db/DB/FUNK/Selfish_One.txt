Selfish one why keep your love to yourself
Oh oh yeah
It's like a souvenir that just sits on a shelf
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
It seems like you built a fence 
Around your heart 
And afraid that sharing
Might tear it apart 
And ya pass up every chance 
At the start of romance oh
Oh oh oh oh Selfish one 
Why keep your love in store 
Oh oh yeah you think it's steel 
That will keep forever more 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
But steel wears out
Through weather and age 
And a heart could break down 
In a lonely stage 
You better let your heart down mate, 
Before it's too late
You let so much time pass by, 
And I find myself still giving you the eye
Then you must have realized, 
'Cause much to my surprise you're making eyes at me 
Is it really you?
Now, selfish one you're walking me to my door
Oh oh yeah
Selfish one, you never did this before
Oh oh no
Without a chance to resist, 
Your lips met mine
You begin to let your lovelight shine
And I can see that you're really on the ball, 
And you're not selfish at all
No, not at all
No, the way you hold me
Oh oh yeah, the way you squeeze me
No you're not selfish, no no no
You're not selfish at all
Oh oh oh, not at all
No the way ya kiss me
Don't ya know that I love the way ya hold me yeah
No not at all, no not at all, no not at all
