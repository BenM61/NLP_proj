[Juicy J]
Freaky lil' thang don't pass me by
Watchin' you out of the corner of my eye
Wit' a big booty and them healthy thighs
Let a nigga get a lil' piece of that pie
You ain't all that but you actin' stuck up
Let me pour some of this drink in ya cup
And maybe lata' on I get them guts
And maybe if not you be catchin' a bus
Pussy ass nigga keep blowin' up ya phone
Can't get the picture won't leave you alone
(U have 12 new voice messages)
Girl what ya done did, that fool head gone
A freaky young playa' need to hook on you
'cause ain't no tellin' what you might do
Chew a nigga up in the Bentley coupe
Toes curled up like the ramen noodles

[Chorus]

[DJ Paul]
She get it so wet, she make it so warm
And on a lame brain man she got a lot of charm
She swallowin like a pill, and makin' them pay them bills
For a another nigga kids cell phone, car and grill
He payin' for the dinner for him her and all her friends
And when he spend the night her dog in the bed he in the den
But still he say he love her
Wouldn't put his mom above her
He did all this after the first time he ever fucked her

[Chorus]

[Remy Ma]
Look, Don't ask nigga you nasty nigga
You had ya tongue in my ass nigga
And you a pro so I know it wadn't the first time and it won't be the last nigga
Ain't tryin' to act like it wasn't all that
When you was sick when I call back
Name any piece of furniture in yo crib an' I can guarantee that we fucked on that
See when you hooked you know that
Its so that you gotta go back
And it seemed like any other chick that you tried to stick the dick in be so whack
It was some reason it won't stay up
But when you wit' me it be way up
And you'll never say no when I call your phone you'll already be ready to lay-up

[Crunchy Black]
He's a lame ass nigga hollerin' that he pimpin' a broad
But found out he was spending M on a broad
Oooh how a nigga be wit' that flawed,
Handcuffin' hoe that'll do that job
Slop on my knob man get that chain
Ain't no shame in our god damn game
All she think about she wanna please her man
Bring him back double drivin' him insane

[Chorus]
