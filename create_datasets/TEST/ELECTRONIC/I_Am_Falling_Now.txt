There is no ending to this life
That I've to live with endless sighs
Oh, can't you see I'm falling now?
Oh, could you hear these words somehow

But I can see the sadness in your eyes
And I can see the sadness in your smile

Hold me now
Heal my wounds
Hold me like you did

There is no ending to this life
That I've to live with endless sighs
And all I know is that my head is gone
And I am falling now

(You don't miss me
You don't love me anymore
You don't need me)
