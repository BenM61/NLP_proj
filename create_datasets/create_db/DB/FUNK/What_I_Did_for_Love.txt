Kiss the day goodbye
The sweetness and the sorrow
We did what we had to do
And I can't regret what I did for love, what I did for love

Look my eyes are dry
And towards always tomorrow
It's as if we always knew
But I won't forget what I did for love, what I did for love

Gone, love is never gone
And we carry on, love's what we'll remember

Kiss the day goodbye
And point me toward tomorrow
And wish me luck, the same to you
Won't regret, can't forget what I did for love

What I did for love
What I did for love
