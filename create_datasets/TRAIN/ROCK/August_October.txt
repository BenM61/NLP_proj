Autumn and Friday the winds blew
July, September, I knew you
And now as I sit On the sand hill
I sing our song to the sea

August October Mid-April, November, may
Becoming hands make you fly 
I cry it's a curtains today

In August October the grass grew
The sky was blue and I want you
Now as I look out my window
I see the world carry on

August October mid-April, November, may
Becoming hands make you fly
I cry it's curtains today

August October mid-April, November, may
Becoming hands make you fly
I cry it's curtains today
