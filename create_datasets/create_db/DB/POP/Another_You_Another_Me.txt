Love at first sight
You and me that breathless night
Love took shape and body
In the morning light
We were sure
This could never have
Happened before
Never before

Taken away
To a world we'd never seen
Souls and bodies keen
To know what love would mean
And we learned
Making up for the nights
We had yearned
We made plans
We made a vow
All so far
From what is now
Strangers somehow

[Chorus]
Another you
Another me
It was the dawn
Of the first day
And life
Had only just begun
Another you
Another me
The past had
Nothing more to say
We had our moment
In the sun
And I can't see
No I can't tell you
How we came to be
Another you
Another me

Never before
Had I said forevermore
Never felt such urge to learn and to explore
It's so strange
When you asked
Do you think this will change
I said 'no'
This is the way
This is how
Our love will stay
Just like today

[Chorus]

And I can't see
No I can't tell you how
It came to be
Another you
Another me
Another you
Another me
