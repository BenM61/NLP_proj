To me and to you
There's no difference for us
Again, avail
Your heart's some trust

Let's open it
Be strong
Cut out
It's lung

Be gentle
Get on
There's no Spanish comic strip
Give up, for real
May sure you've got your gun

Let's open it
Be strong
Cut out
It's lung

Let's open it
Be strong
Cut out
It's lung
