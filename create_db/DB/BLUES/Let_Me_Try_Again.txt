I know I said that I was leaving
But I just couldn't say good-bye
It was only self-deceiving
To walk away from someone who
Means everything on earth to you

You learn with every lonely day
I've learned, and now I'm (i've come) back to stay

Let me try again, let me try again
Think of all we had before, let me try once more
We can have it all, you and I again
Please forgive me or I'll die, let me try again

I was such a fool to doubt you
To try to go it all alone
There's no sense to life without you
Now all I do is just exist
And think about the chance I've missed

To beg is not an easy task
(but) pride is such a foolish mask

Let me try again, let me try again
Think of all we had before, let me try once more
We can have it all, you and I again
Please forgive me or I'll die, (please) let me try again
