:: chrysantemum :: 

for you I'm a chrysantemum 
supernova, urgent star 

:: astera compositae :: 

for you i'll be a dandelion 
a thousand flowerettes in the sky 
or just a drop in the ocean 

if you know my name 
don't speak it out 
it holds a power - as before 

:: liliacea :: 

a lily of the valley 
a flower of saron 

:: helianthus annus :: 

for you i even be a sunflower 
do you hear my enlightening laughter? 
another reason to cut off an ear 

you know my name, do you not? 
don't say it 
for it is sacred, immovable - frozen 

:: rosa, anemone et nymphea alba :: 

i'll even be a waterlily, 
a marygold, a rose 
or a little thistle 

:: euphorbia :: 

a blue dahlia, a black tulip 
that's where opinions differ 
the scholars disagree 

my name, should you know it 
remains unspeakable 
and is spoken - malediction
