It's the little old lady from Pasadena

The little old lady from Pasadena
(Go, Granny, go, Granny, go Granny go)
Has a pretty little flower bed of white gardenias
(Go, Granny, go, Granny, go Granny go)
But parked in a rickety old garage
Is a brand new, shiny red Super Stock Dodge

And everybody's sayin' that there's nobody meaner
Than the little old lady from Pasadena
(She drives real fast and she drives real hard)
She's the terror of Colorado Boulevard

It's the little old lady from Pasadena
If you see her on the street don't try to choose her
(Go, Granny, go, Granny, go Granny go)
You might drive a goer but you'll never lose her
(Go, Granny, go, Granny, go Granny go)
Well, she's gonna get a ticket now sooner or later
'Cause she can't keep her foot off the accelerator

And everybody's sayin' that there's nobody meaner
Than the little old lady from Pasadena
(She drives real fast and she drives real hard)
She's the terror of Colorado Boulevard

(Go, Granny, go, Granny, go Granny go)
(Go, Granny, go, Granny, go Granny go)
The guys come to race her for miles around
But she'll give 'em a length and then she'll shut 'em down

And everybody's sayin' that there's nobody meaner
Than the little old lady from Pasadena
(She drives real fast and she drives real hard)
She's the terror of Colorado Boulevard

Go, Granny, go, Granny, go Granny go  
Go, Granny, go, Granny, go Granny go  
Go, Granny, go, Granny, go Granny go  
Go, Granny, go, Granny, go Granny go  
Go, Granny, go, Granny, go Granny go  
Go, Granny, go, Granny, go Granny go
