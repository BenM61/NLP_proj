I am milk
I am red hot kitchen
And I am cool
Cool as the deep blue ocean

I am lost
So I am cruel
But I'd be love and sweetness
If I had you
I'm waiting
I'm waiting
For you

I'm waiting
I'm waiting
For you

I am weak
But I am strong
I can use my tears to
Bring you home
I'm waiting
I'm waiting
For you

I'm waiting
I'm waiting
For you

I'm waiting
I'm waiting
For you

I am milk
I am red hot kitchen
I am cool
Cool as the deep blue ocean

I'm waiting
I'm waiting
For you

I'm waiting
I'm waiting
For you

I'm waiting
I'm waiting
For you

I'm aching for you
I'm aching for you

I'm waiting
I'm waiting
I'm waiting
For you
