If you get lonely on your daddy's farm
Just remember I don't live too far
And there's a red bridge that arcs the bay, yeah
You'll be at my place in less that a day

So get on your bad motor scooter and ride
Up over to my place and stay all night
First thing in the morning we'll be feeling all right
So get on your bad motor scooter and ride

Ooh, the last I seen your face
I swore that no one would take your place
Now since you've been gone I've been feelin' bad, yeah
I'd come out to your place but I'm afraid of your dad so you

You get on your bad motor scooter and ride
Up over to my place and stay all night
First thing in the morning we'll be feeling all right, all right, all right, all right
Get on your bad motor scooter and ride

Ride, ride, ride
Come on baby, ooh yeah
Crank it on up

Get on your bad motor scooter and ride
Up over to my place and stay all night
First thing in the morning we'll be feeling all right, all right, all right, all right
Get on your bad motor scooter and ride
Get on your bad motor scooter
Get on your bad motor scooter and ride
