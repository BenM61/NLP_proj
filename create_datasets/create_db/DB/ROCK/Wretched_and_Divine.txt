Go

I am the innocence
I am what could have been
The dreams you talk about
Now left on broken skin

Your lies is stereo
All in when chaos rings
The world is sturdy huh
Bounced down and twisted maze

A word of hate a race we are the ones
They all look the same
Our time is come

I am the chosen wretched and divine
I am the unspoken
The one they left behind
Feelings fire till we die
I am broken the wretched and divine

I am the devil's smile
The one caught every day
A hopeful people's speech
Won't stop to you to bleed

I am the hurricane
And I'm the strongest one
As they sit back and laugh
The world you left is just being

A word of hate a race we are the ones
They all look the same
Our time is come

I am the chosen wretched and divine
I am the unspoken
The one they left behind
Feelings fire till we die
I am broken the wretched and divine

I'm broken (broken) the wretched and divine

(Divine)

We live from the broken hearts
We watch them fall apart
We live for the ones who don't know they exist
We die for the endless winter
We came from the land of sin
We die for the ones who raise their
Hence two reasons

I am the chosen wretched and divine
I am the unspoken
The one they left behind
Feelings fire till we die
I am broken the wretched and divine

I am broken (broken) the wretched and divine

(Wretched and divine)

The wretched and divine
