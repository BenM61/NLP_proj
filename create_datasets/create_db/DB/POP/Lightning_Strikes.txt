Listen to me, baby, you gotta understand (ma-me-aah, ooh)
You're old enough to know the makings of a man (ma-me-aah, ooh)
Listen to me, baby, it's hard to settle down (ma-me-aah, ooh)
Am I asking too much for you to stick around (ma-me-aah, ooh)

Every boy wants a girl
He can trust to the very end
Baby, that's you
Won't you wait but 'til then?

When I see lips beggin' to be kissed (stop)
I can't stop (stop) I can't stop myself (stop, stop)
Lightning is striking again
Lightning is striking again

Nature's takin' over my one-track mind (ma-me-aah, ooh)
Believe it or not, you're in my heart all the time (ma-me-aah, ooh)
All the girls are sayin' that you'll end up a fool (ma-me-aah, ooh)
For the time being, baby, live by my rules (ma-me-aah, ooh)

When I settle down
I want one baby on my mind
Forgive and forget
And I'll make up for all lost time

If she's put together fine and she's readin' my mind (stop)
I can't stop (stop) I can't stop myself (stop, stop)
Lightning is striking again
Lightning is striking again and again and again and again

(Ma-me-aah, ooh)
(Ma-me-aah, ooh)
(Ma-me-aah, ooh)

Lightning is striking again
Lightning is striking again

There's a chapel in the pines
Waiting for us around the bend
Picture in your mind
Love forever, but 'til then

If she gives me a sign that she wants to make time (stop)
I can't stop (stop) I can't stop myself (stop, stop)

Lightning is striking again
Lightning is striking again and again and again and again
Lightning is striking again and again and again and again
