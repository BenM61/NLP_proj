On a Sunday morn sat a maid forlorn 
With her sweetheart by her side, 
Through the windowpane, she looked at the rain, 
"We must stay home, Joe," she cried. 
"There's a picnic, too, at the old Point View, 
It's a shame it rained today." 
Then the boy drew near, kissed away each tear, 
And she heard him softly say,
"Wait till the sun shines, Nellie, 
When the clouds go drifting by, 
We will be happy, Nellie, 
Don't you sigh. 

Down Lover's Lane we'll wander, 
Sweethearts you and I. 
Wait till the sun shines, Nellie, 
Bye and bye." 

"How I long," she sighed, "for a trolley ride 
Just to show my brand new gown." 
Then she gazed on high with a gladsome cry 
For the sun came shining down. 
And she looked so sweet on the big front seat 
As the car sped on its way, 
And she whispered low, 
"Say you're all right, Joe, 
You just won my heart today.
