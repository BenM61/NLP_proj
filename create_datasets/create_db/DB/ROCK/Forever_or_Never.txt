Don't believe in miracles
I never did
Nothing ever happens here
So sick of it

I-I-I told you
I-I-I need to
Get - get myself into something new
I'm for something mystical, hysterical,
Dark, intensive, sexual

I'm not gonna live forever
Said I'm not gonna live forever
Better make it now or never
(ever, ever)
I'm not gonna live forever
Said I'm not gonna live forever
Gotta make it now or never
(forever or never)

I don't believe in fairy tales
Too cynical
Everybody stop and stare
I let it go

I-I-I told you
I-I-I need to
Stick - stick - stick out
Just can't be like you

Send myself to out of space
A better place
Gotta win the human race

I'm not gonna live forever
Said I'm not gonna live forever
Better make it now or never
(ever, ever)
I'm not gonna live forever
Said I'm not gonna live forever
Gotta make it now or never
(forever or never)

For my love
For my love
For my love, it's forever, forever

I'm not gonna live forever
Said I'm not gonna live forever
Better make it now or never
(ever, ever)
I'm not gonna live forever
Said I'm not gonna live forever
Gotta make it now or never
(forever or never)
