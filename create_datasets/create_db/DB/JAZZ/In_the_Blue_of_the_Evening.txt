In the blue of evening when you appear close to me, dear one
There in the dusk we'll share a dream reverie
In the blue of evening while crickets call and stars are falling
There 'neath the midnight sky you'll come to me

In the shadows of the night we'll stand, I'll touch your hand
And then, softly as your lovely eyes entreat, our lips will meet again
In the blue of evening, night winds above whisper I love you
There will we find romance in the blue of evening
