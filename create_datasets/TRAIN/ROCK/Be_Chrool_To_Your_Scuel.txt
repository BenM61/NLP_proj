Be cruel to your school 'cause you may never get another
Be cruel to your school in the name of rock 'n' roll
Be cruel to your school just like a sister or a brother
Be cruel to your school in the name of rock 'n' roll

Well, I don't think I'll make it through another day, it's eight o'clock and all ain't well
My brain hurts so much it's stratin' to decay and I'm livin' in my private hell
Didn't somebody tell me this would be so great, be the best thing I ever had?
How come they never told me 'bout the word "exaggerate"
, how'd somethin' so good get so bad?
'Cause hey, I gotta know am I slow?
Where do I go from here?
Do abc's and 123's
Mean that much to me, that much to me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me


Sing it, Alice
I see them walkin' 'round like the livin' dead, ain't they got nothin' between their ears?
How come they don't seem to hear a single word I say, they ain't the only one who's bored to tears
Now there must be a better way to educate 'cause this way ain't workin' like it should
Can't they just invent a pill or frozen concentrate that makes you smarter and taste, mmm, so good
'Cause hey, I gotta know what I'll have to show
When I hi hi ho it from here
Will I be in pain or will I have a brain
Or will I go insane, I've gone insay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ane

Solo - sax: Clarence Clemons, guitar: Brian Setzer

'Cause hey, I gotta know what I'll have to show
When I hi hi ho it from here
Do abc's and 123's
Mean that much to me, that much to me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me


Alright
