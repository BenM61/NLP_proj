Lay it down, lay it down cocksukaz, 
All you hatas and bustas best beware, 
Cause if you think its about chu comin' out hard, 
On da outside lookin' in, 
On top of da world,
Space age pimpin',
And living legends da motherfuckaz back,
Guns cocked, and reloaded 
Hm, and dey ridin' high.

[Chorus]
Clap on, clap off,
Got dis strap willin' to knock ya trap off
Clap on, clap off,
Got dis strap willin' to knock ya cap off

Big face rubber band gimme dat shit 
Nigga you don't need it anyway loud mouth bitch nigga, 
Snitch nigga at da club like he ain't done nothin' 
Chest poked out cock sucka' you don't run nothin' 
OK I'm a pull a muthafuckin' o.j. 
Leave da premises bloody ride off wit da yay! 
Pray you dont ever see it unfold in ya face nigga 
Dis shit and wax is da inner taste off 
Wit cha fuckin' head dispose of da body 
Put da work on da street wrist froze at da party 
Dis here certified industry never me disrespect 
Boy you know what its goin' be

[Chorus: x2]

My nigga you know what its feelin; to be death to my enemy 
Patna your no kin t me tell it to da gelatin 
Herd chu been spillin' beans birds from da Philippines 
One serve judge 2 da nigga you feelin' to serve me, 
I ain't feelin' to go back for nar a nigga 
Naw one phone call bullets comin' through ya 
Wall play about my mu fuckin' money and da saw 
My nigas tow throw aways fuk da law tools on deck 
Wit tech's and da sawed-off shots 2 ya neck 
Whats left get hauled off got em shot em bullets 
Bouncin' lossen blood by da ounces momma cryin' up a river when da news announces

[Chorus: x2]

I'm pimp tight M-J-G plenty ammunition 
In my coat pocket when I squeeze I'ma get attention 
You can talk shit just don't put my name in it, 
Dis is real life and I don't play games in it, 
I'm a stranger to you so you can't handle me you ain't killin nothin' 
But ya homeboy's and ya league you can bump ya guns, 
All dat bullet talk you say you don't mean shit,
Mufucka' dis a new day you can neva play like piano 
You sloppy I'm jus' slippin' like Giano Versaci 
I'm like da wire you don't wanna start shit 
I get a doctor to kill you, and dump you in some apartments

[Chorus]
