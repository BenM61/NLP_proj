Hang up the chick habit
Hang it up, daddy,
Or you'll be alone in a quick
Hang up the chick habit
Hang it up, daddy,
Or you'll never get another fix

I'm telling you it's not a trick
Pay attention, don't be thick
Or you're liable to get licked

You're gonna see the reason why
When they're spitting in your eye
They'll be spitting in your eye

Hang up the chick habit
Hang it up, daddy,
A girl's not a tonic or a pill
Hang up the chick habit
Hang it up, daddy,
You're just jonesing for a spill

Oh, how your bubble's gonna burst
When you meet another nurse
She'll be driving in a hearse

You're gonna need a heap of glue
When they all catch up with you
And they cut you up in two

Now your ears are ringing
The birds have stopped their singing
Everything is turning grey

No candy in your till
No cutie left to thrill
You're alone on a Tuesday

Hang up the chick habit
Hang it up, daddy,
Or you'll be alone in a quick
Hang up the chick habit
Hang it up, daddy,
Or you'll never get another fix

I'm telling you it's not a trick
Pay attention, don't be thick
Or you're liable to get licked

You're gonna see the reason why
When they're spitting in your eye
They'll be spitting in your eye

You're gonna see the reason why
When they're spitting in your eye
They'll be spitting in your eye

You're gonna see the reason why
When they're spitting in your eye
They'll be spitting in your eye

You're gonna see the reason why
When they're spitting in your eye
They'll be spitting in your eye
