Come to Q quarters
We're watching heads of state from here
Sticking their Fabers
Deep into the empire's ear
Moulding the conscience
Severe in every secret sworn
Now take the cuckoo and revel in your image born

Push through the high ranks
Bulldoze sacred heritage
Instinct finds shelter
Cowering in the foliage
Detour reservoirs
Flood a city pretty please
Lost in petroleum
Fueled to fill the empty seas

Obsolete children
Their populations died en masse
Concrete civilians
Statues to the house of rest
Washing down bodies
Seems to me a dead-end chore
Floors me completely
Beauty drips from every pore
From every pore
From every pore

Q quarters

Come to Q quarters
We're watching heads of state from here
Sticking their Fabers
Deep into the empire's ear
Moulding the conscience
Severe and every secret sworn
Now take the cuckoo and revel in your image born

Q quarters
Q quarters
Q quarters
