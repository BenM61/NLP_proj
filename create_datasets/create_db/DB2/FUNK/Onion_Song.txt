The world is just a great big onion
And pain and fear are the spices that make you cry
Oh, baby, and the only way to get rid of this great big onion
Is to plant love seeds until it dies, uh-huh

Hey world, we got a great big job to do
Yeah, we need you
And everybody who loves truth
Don't you know we've got to clean up this place
And reach for a higher goal, yeah, yes we do, now
We gotta be headstrong about rightin' the wrong
And make a lot more happy songs, oh, oh, baby

The world is just a great big onion
And I don't care, is the face people like to wear
Yes it is now, oh, baby
And the only way to get rid of this great big onion
Every one single soul's got to do their share
Tell about it, baby, whoo

So come on, let's knock on every door, whoo
Tell them love is the answer
Whether they're rich or poor
Oh, yeah, now, we don't care what you do
How you look, or your status claim, baby
No no, because brothers and sisters
From now on, is gonna be everyone's name, oh-oh, whoo

The world is just a great big onion
And pain and fear are the spices that make you cry
Yes it is, oh, baby
And the only way to get rid of this great big onion
Is to plant love seeds
Now everybody, got to plant love seeds
Come on and plant love seeds
Until it dies
The world is just a great big onion
