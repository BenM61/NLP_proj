Oh
Omarion, yea, it's Gucci!
Song dynasty, yeah
Watch me get it
Gucci, Gucci!

I done cut the braids, low cut, got my grown on
Had a sister label, gettin' money, money, long, long
I be so L.A. got my Chucks and my Locs on
I was M-I-A, in M-I-A superman on

I know I got it (Got it got it)
I know she on it (On it on it)
I know you see it (See it see it)
I know she want it (Want it want it)
She got that Cali good and she kinda hood
She got me policin' and wishin' that a nigga would

This lil' mama got her back right
She be skatin' on it, got a nigga singin' flashlight
They be trying to get her, but she be holdin' on hella tight
I got to act right, that's what she like

I get it in, I get it in
I get it in, I get it again and again
I get it in, I get it in
I get it in, I get up in the thing
I get it

Done with them boys, 'cause she done found a man now
Ain't no competition, she fumble when it hangs down
I'm a show her love, love, even when when my fans 'round
Get into the music baby, tell me how my bass sound

I know I got it (Got it got it)
I know she on it (On it on it)
I know you see it (See it see it)
I know she want it (Want it want it)
She got that Cali good and she kinda hood
She got me policin' and wishin' that a nigga would

This lil' mama got her back right
She be skatin' on it, got a nigga singin' flashlight
They be trying to get her, but she be holdin' on hella tight
I got to act right, that's what she like

I get it in, I get it in
I get it in, I get it again and again
I get it in, I get it in
I get it in, I get up in the thing
I get it

Tennis shoes, fur coat, Louie V carry on
Gucci mane, Gucci girls, panties she ain't wearing none,
and don't want me to buy her none, man she tha fire huh!
damn near broke her neck when she seen me wit' Omarion
double take, double take, lets go have a triple date!
me and you ain't no choice you be wit y'all think y'all can handle that!
and if i ain't puttin' it down right! You can cancel me
I'm married to the game, so right now you cant marry me!
Champagne wishes, private jets kisses, Shanghai, Bangkok
We over seas trippin', Pinocchio your nose will grow,
I'm smokin' dro' in Tokyo a trapper but this rapper
got me goin' places you'll never go!

I get it in, I get it in
I get it in, I get it again and again
I get it in, I get it in
I get it in, I get up in the thing
I get it

Omarion
