To the beat, to the beat, to the beat 'cause I need
Everybody to the floor, why' 'cause this beat is sick, yeah
It's time to rock, uh, that's what it is
Tiffany's her name, love is the game
And the only way to play is with this promise ring

Sometimes a girl needs to know that she's
Appreciated for all the things she does
With some sorta token of love
'Cause without it her young heart won't know

And right then to my surprise, he
Pulled out a small velvet box, pink ribbon tied
I'm wondering what's inside
He opened it and then he replied

He said, I promise not to hurt you, I promise not to lie
I promise to befriend you and defend you with my life
I promise you forever, I promise you today, he said
Would you wear my promise ring' I said yes

If ya break ya promise we breakin' up
Got a couple things that I want
Walks in the park and sweet things
If I rock your promise ring

I could be your pretty young thing
You could become my king
I gotta know you got me
Yes, I'll rock your promise ring

Yes, I'll rock your promise, promise, promise ring
Yes, I'll rock your promise, yes, I'll rock your promise ring
Yes, I'll rock your promise, promise, promise ring
Yes, I'll rock your promise, yes, I'll rock your promise ring

How in the world could a girl say no'
I knew it the moment he made my finger glow
It was good to know I'm who he chose
It was your heart he felt now it shows, now it shows

You know when you see me floss
No way it's gon' get lost, I'll never take this off
I'm older and they call me by your name
I'll wear it on a chain, because I can hear you say

He said I promise not to hurt you, I promise not to lie
I promise to befriend you and defend you with my life
I promise you forever, I promise you today, he said
Would you wear my promise ring' I said yes

If ya break ya promise we breakin' up
Got a couple things that I want
Walks in the park and sweet things
If I rock your promise ring

I could be your pretty young thing
You could become my king
I gotta know you got me
Yes, I'll rock your promise ring

Yes, I'll rock your promise, promise, promise ring
Yes, I'll rock your promise, yes, I'll rock your promise ring
Yes, I'll rock your promise, promise, promise ring
Yes, I'll rock your promise, yes, I'll rock your promise ring

Everybody get up and rock to this beat
My name is Tiffany and why'all know me
All my girls with me, all the boys like me
Come correctly with the promise ring
And you just might be my boo, my boo

Promise that you'll never let me go and boy I'll
Boy I'll wear your promise ring
All you have to do is say the word and boy I'll
Boy I'll wear your promise ring

Just let me know, just let me know, what I gotta do'
Just let me know, just let me know
You ain't goin' nowhere, I ain't goin' nowhere
I'll be on for sure but you gotta know that

If ya break ya promise we breakin' up
Got a couple things that I want
Walks in the park and sweet things
If I rock your promise ring

I could be your pretty young thing
You could become my king
I gotta know you got me
Yes, I'll rock your promise ring

Yes, I'll rock your promise, promise, promise ring
Yes, I'll rock your promise, yes, I'll rock your promise ring
Yes, I'll rock your promise, promise, promise ring
Yes, I'll rock your promise, yes, I'll rock your promise ring

If I rock your promise ring
Young thing, my king
