Labrinth! come in!

Ladies and gentlemen
This is something they call
A ground breaker
So let me first apologize
To shirts and the ties
For your make up
'Cause I'll make you ugly
As soon as it drops
We're on a rampage
Bottles popping off
Before you know it
There's rubble and dust
'Cause we be fucking it up
Somebody say (you better run)

Yeah

I predict an earthquake
Didn't happen

Say yeah

I predict an earthquake
Up in here

Cause we throw bombs on it
Throw bombs on it
Just smash something
Yeah mosh for me

Yeah

We can make an earthquake up in here

So here we go we go

Ladies and gentlemen
What you're about to witness
Is no illusion
And now we got the bass banging
From here to Buckingham palace
They're all moving
Hey Simon

Turning em psycho
Everybody rock
We bring the house down
To rubble dust
'Cause we be fucking it up

Somebody say (you better run)

With out a match or lighter
Don't do girlfriends
One nighters make them c'minor if I want Christian

Doing all nighters no days off grey hairs and a little
Bit of weight loss
