Woke up in a stupor
Guess it's time to face the pooper
Sometimes I feel like superman
Sometimes I'm just recuperating

My head is twisting in its cage
My mind feels like a twenty gage
I hope it's just a passing stage
My heart's not red it's
Beige

And its days like this that burn me
Turn me inside out and learn me
Not to tell you anything I think I know
Well I think I'll tell you all that I know
Try to tell you all about it thought you
Might've lord i doubt it
Everyday's a waste I know everyday's a funeral

I'm cutting out I'm feeling lost
I've lost my mind I'm Mr. Frost
I've collected all the evidence
I'm off the edge I'm on the fence

And its days like this that burn me
Turn me inside out and learn me
Not to tell you anything I think I know
Well I think I'll tell you all that I know

I don't want to be alone I want to be a stone
I want to sink to the bottom of the ocean
And lie there with you til I'm gone

At the bottom of the big blue sea
Just you and me At the bottom of the big blue sea
The bottom of the big blue sea
Just you and me At the bottom of the big blue sea

I know I'll never know nobody
Better than I know myself
But I can't even figure out
Just what the f*ck I'm all about

I'm sinking, I'm swimming no wait a minute
I'm drowning no I ain't kidding around
Sometimes i think i'm gonna make it
Sometimes I fake it

And its days like this that burn me
Turn me inside out and learn me
Not to tell you anything I think I know
Well I think I'll tell you all that I know

Anywhere and everywhere
Made up my mind it's getting weird
It's queer to think it might not
Get much better than today I fear
Won't know true happiness
I tried so hard I did my best
My best wasn't good enough
Oh god I hate this stuff

And its days like this that burn me
Turn me inside out and learn me
Not to tell you anything I think I know
Well I think I'll tell you all that I know
I don't want to be alone I want to be a stone
I want to sink to the bottom of the ocean
And lie there laugh there with you laugh
Yhere with you til I'm gone

At the bottom of the big blue sea
Just you and me At the bottom of the big blue sea
the bottom of the big blue sea
Just you and me At the bottom of the big blue sea

And its days like this that burn me
Turn me inside out and learn me
Its days like this that burn me
Turn me inside out and learn me
And its days like this that burn me
Turn me inside out and learn me
Not to tell you anything I think I know
