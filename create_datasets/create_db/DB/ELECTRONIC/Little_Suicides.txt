It happens in the smallest ways
It happens all the time
But if you've never had your sight
What's it mean to be blind
Now maybe they all just pretend to be
Or maybe we're not trying
Can't we just be happy for awhile
It happens all the time

All these little suicides
They hardly make a mark
I can take these fun-house rides
I'm a natural in the dark
I'm a natural in the dark
In the dark

If I could give you that
I'd give it all the time
You're just a little tired today
Tomorrow you'll be fine
If love heals anything at all
We should be flying
If I could give you that
I'd love you all the time

You're everything I've ever wanted
You're everything to me
Is there no stopping when it's started
These old hearts just come apart

It happens in the smallest ways
It happens all the time
If I'm not who I used to be
Well, it's not to be unkind
And if you feel these aren't your better days
Oh, I don't mind
Can't we just be happy for awhile
It happens all the time
