It's a rainy afternoon
In ninteen-ninety
The big city
Geez, it's been twenty years
Candy, you were so fine

Beautiful, beautiful girl from the north
You burned my heart with a flickering torch
I had a dream that no one else could see
You gave me love for free

Candy, candy, candy I can't let you go
All my life you're haunting me, I loved you so

Candy, candy, candy I can't let you go
Life is crazy
Candy, baby

Yeah, well it hurt me real bad when you left
Hey, I'm glad you got out, but, but I miss you
I've had a hole in my heart for so long
I've learned to fake it and just smile along

Down on the street
Those men are all the same
I need a love
Not games
Not games

Candy, candy, candy I can't let you go
All my life you're haunting me, I loved you so
Candy, candy, candy I can't let you go
Life is crazy
I know, baby
Candy, baby

You-you-you, candy, candy, candy, I can't let you go
All my life you're haunting me, I loved you so

Candy, candy, candy, life is crazy
Candy, baby

Candy baby
Candy, candy

Candy, candy, candy I can't let you go
All my life you're haunting me, I loved you so
Candy, candy, candy I can't let you go
