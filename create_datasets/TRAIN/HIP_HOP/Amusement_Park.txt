We're back, move 50 cent
Amusement park,F 50,(Incomprehensible), G Unit

Shorty you ain't gotta take ya panties off
Just pull 'em to the side
If you wanna ride on the roller coaster
Baby, come on and ride

It go up and down and 'round and 'round
Stand up or get on the floor
It's on tonight, I know what you like
I know just how to break you off

Good evening ladies, I tell you from the start
I'm hoping you enjoy my amusement park
There's lots of activities fun things to do
And I'll find my pleasure in pleasing you

Some rides go fast some rides go slow
You fear heights when I'm high, hell yeah I'll go low
It tastes so sweet that sticky cotton candy
We get carried away we be startin' a family

It's a perfect time for a magic trick
Girl, you know it's no fun without the magic stick
Now watch me as I pull a rabbit out a hat
Then you can use the rabbit all over your cat

Applause now that's the first half of my act
Started out a pimp now I'm more like a mac
I don't need your paper just don't f*ck with my stacks
(Oh, it's like that?)
Yeah, it's like that

Shorty you ain't gotta take ya panties off
Just pull em to the side
If you wanna ride on the roller coaster
Baby come on and ride

It go up and down and 'round and 'round
Stand up or get on the floor
It's on tonight I know what you like
I know just how to break you off

Now, you can ride the horse around the carousel
Explosives, it's all in the hotel
Put me to the test girl, I don't fail
I'll work it out without a doubt

there's plenty water rides I'm sure to get you wet in the park
Have your luster's seduction considered or not
Throw a hoop around the bottle, I'll be your teddy bear
Whatever color you like you know, I don't care

I really want to thank you for attending this affair
Now go encourage your friends to come have fun here
I smile when I speak but I'm being sincere
And your pass is valid all summer my dear

So watch everything that you can always return
There's so many tricks to the trade you should learn
Suck that, lick that, swallow that lollipop
Forget that, grip that, ride it nonstop

Shorty you ain't gotta take ya panties off
Just pull 'em to the side
If you wanna ride on the roller coaster
Baby come on and ride

It go up and down and 'round and 'round
Stand up or get on the floor
It's on tonight, I know what you like
I know just how to break you off

For you switch ass niggas, it's me Snitches
For one
