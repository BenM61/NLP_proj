So you want to live forever?
Give your stirring speeches on TV
We can laugh about it later, can't we?

All you heroes went down fighting
So you get in every fight you can
And it makes feel so much closer
To the man

I get my killing in the free world ain't it fun?
Its good for everyone
For better television
Does anybody want it? come on
Will you pick up your daddy's gun?

Brother can you smell the envy?
Everybody wants to be like you
And the ones who don't well f*ck 'em
And you do

I get my killing in the free world ain't it fun?
Its good for everyone
For better television
Does anybody want it? come on
Will you pick up your daddy's gun?

oh inshallah
Does anybody wanna get off?
Oh oh inshallah
And the cars will run forever
Its good for everyone 
For better television
Does anybody want it come on
Will you pick up your daddy's gun?
