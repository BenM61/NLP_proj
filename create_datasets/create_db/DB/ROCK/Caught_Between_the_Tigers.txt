Dark eyes come down on you 
Whisper your name so sweet 
Cold lies break from her lips 
You don't feel the heat 

There ain't no time to settle down 
You're living on shakey ground 
If that's what love is all about 
There's only one way out 

Somewhere on a distant street 
You're caught between the tigers 
If you're walkin' on fire don't burn your feet 
You're caught between the tigers 

Sharp words cut down your spine 
They stand in circle strong! 
Be still in silent fear 
For they'll soon be gone 
They disappear before the dawn 
Gonna disappear! 
C'mon, c'mon 

There ain't no people you can trust 
This city's been stained with lust 
If that's what life is all about 
There's only one way out 

Somewhere on a distant street 
You're caught between the tigers 
If you're walkin' on fire don't burn your feet 
You're caught between the tigers 

(solo) 

Somewhere on a distant street 
You're caught between the tigers 
If you're walkin' on fire don't burn your feet 
You're caught between the tigers
