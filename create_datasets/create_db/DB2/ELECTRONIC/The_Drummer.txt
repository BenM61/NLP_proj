Sometimes I wonder what made me leave it
The water in the deep sea
The crystal chain

Sometimes I look to the West
And I wonder what made me leave it
And the dream I had of something to grow old to
Now I lost it

Oh I love the rhythm
The pounding of my heart
I'm a drum, I'm a drum now
It is what makes me human
Oh a beat to the bone
Oh I am a drum
It's the heart, it's the heart
It is what makes me human

Sometimes I look to the East
And I wonder when will she reach me
The very core of me,
I will have to cross that river

Oh I love the rhythm
The pounding of my heart
I'm a drum, I'm a drum now
It is what makes me human
Oh a beat to the bone
Oh I am a drum
It's the heart, it's the heart
It is what makes me human

For every footstep, it's getting hard to turn back
And did I ever know where I came from?
And do I know where I'm heading at?
For every footstep, it's getting hard to look back
And did I ever know where I came from?
And do I want what I'm heading for?
Oh ask yourself, do you?

Oh I love the rhythm
The pounding of my heart
I'm a drum, I'm a drum now
It is what makes me human
Oh a beat to the bone
Oh I am a drum
It's the heart, it's the heart
It is what makes me human
