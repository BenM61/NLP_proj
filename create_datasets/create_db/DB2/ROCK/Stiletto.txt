What am I going to do with my poisoned heart
Why'd you have to leave your mark
I could not resist your seduction
I was a virgin
You were the steel
You're coming in and you don't care how it feels

Hey, Stiletto
You're much too dangerous
You might look glamorous
But I know you could cut me

Hey, Stiletto
I'll be your sacrifice
You want to take a bite
And you know how to cut me
You know how to cut me

What am I gonna say when you've had enough
I feel like I've been betrayed
Go sharpen your blade on someone else
You were the weapon
I was the prey
And you won't have it any other way

Hey, Stiletto
You're much too dangerous
You might look glamorous
But I know you could cut me

Hey, Stiletto
I'll be your sacrifice
You want to take a bite
You know how to cut me
You know how to cut me

You were the one in my fantasy
I really thought I could make you love me
You must find pleasure in cruelty
It's too deep for me
It's a mystery

Hey, Stiletto
You're much too dangerous
You might look glamorous
But I know you could cut me

Hey, Stiletto
I'll be your sacrifice
You want to take a bite
You know how to cut me

Hey, Stiletto
You're much too dangerous
You might look glamorous
But I know you could cut me

Hey, Stiletto
I'll be your sacrifice
You want to take a bite
You know how to cut me

You know how to cut me
