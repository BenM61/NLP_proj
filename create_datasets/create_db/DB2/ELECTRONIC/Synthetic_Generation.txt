I play hell, you play heaven
I'm deaths own little star...
Can you trace the sins that haunt you,
And play the devil's cards as I do?

I am all that you see,
I am all that you want me to be!

I am god, and so the antichrist
I'm blessed, yet damned
I'm fallen, yet resurrected
I'm all of nothing!

I play death, you play life, triple sixes to rise
Can you see the visions I brought you,
And the devilish games that I taught you?

I am all that you see,
I am all that you want me to be!

I am god, and so the anti-christ
I'm blessed, yet damned
I'm fallen, yet resurrected
I'm all of nothing!

Synthetic generation
Stop not, it's indifference high you must know
I am all that you see,
I am all that you want me to be!

I am god, and so the anti-christ
I'm blessed, yet damned
I'm fallen, yet resurrected
I'm all of nothing!
