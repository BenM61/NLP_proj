There's somethin' that I know I shoulda told you
Somethin' that's growin' every day
Whether or not
I say it a lot
I'm down with you in every single way
Gonna be days when you are lonely
And people will say they got no time
When you're alone
Call me on the phone
Baby, you always got mine

And when the wind blows
Baby don't cry just remember my words

Baby Luv
Gentle as raindrops fallin' in June
Pretty as sunshine
And flowers that bloom
Baby luv
Long as you're happy, I'm happy too
It's a delight
You're in my life
Baby luv, baby luv

You got a glow that just surrounds you
When I'm with you I'm shining bright
Honey it's true
I love the way you do
And I could tell you every night
You're so lovely when you're laughin'
It makes my day to see you smile
Didn't you know
When you play in the snow
You set my winter on fire

And when the wind blows
Baby don't cry just remember my words

Baby Luv
Gentle as raindrops fallin' in June
Pretty as sunshine
And flowers that bloom
Baby luv
Long as you're happy, I'm happy too
It's a delight
God gave you life
Baby luv

Ooh baby luv, baby, baby

Baby Luv
Gentle as raindrops fallin' in June
Pretty as sunshine
And flowers that bloom
Baby luv
Long as you're happy, I'm happy too
It's a delight
You're in my life
Baby luv, baby luv
