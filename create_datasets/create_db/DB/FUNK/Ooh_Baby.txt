(Whoa-ooh baby, I love you)
(Whoa-ooh baby, I love you)
Wait a minute
You know my woman told me, she said, Bo Diddley
I love you, but I'm leavin'
I said, what?
She said, "I love you but I'm leavin' you"
And I said, "Baby?"
And she kept sayin', "Whoa baby, I love you"
What you say, girl?
(Whoa-ooh baby, I love you)
Ow, somethin' wrong here someplace
(Whoa-oh baby, I love you)

Wait a minute
She said now
I said hold it a minute
Let me tell you something
She said, "Here's the key to all of your locks
Take my name off of your mailbox
Here's the key to your Cadillac
I got my own parked right out back"

I said, "What?"
There somethin' wrong here
And she kept talkin' 'bout
I love you (Whoa-ooh baby, I love you)

Fellas, let me tell you somethin'
Ha, ha, ha
Wow! Woo, somethin' wrong
(Whoa-oh baby, I love need you)

Wait a minute, let me tell you what else she told me
She said, "You know one thing, Diddley
I got all my bags packed, in the middle of the dining room floor
I'm just waiting, I'm all packed and ready to go"
I said, "But baby, whoa baby
Baby, baby"

And then she told me, she said
Take my name off your front door
I won't be getting my mail here no more
Got my own place with brand new locks
I'm gonna tell the mailman I got a brand new box
(Whoa-oh baby, I love you) You ain't jiving are you?
