Blue moonlight enfolds the night 
And you are my arms? delight 
Sweet are the secrets to tell 
Here in the spell of... 
Blue moonlight that fills the skies 
there's some of it in your eyes 
Or is it what I'm dreaming of, 
Whisper and say it?s love... 
The world could stand still, I?d never know, 
I'm lost in the thrill of loving you so, 
Here in the glow of... 
Blue Moonlight that seems to shine 
Right into this heart of mine 
Tell me this heaven is true 
Tell me you love me too!
