Dippy doo, run, run, run 
Dippy doo, run, run, run 

Hey, I'm taking my bag
And I'm running away now
'Cause you've been mean to me
And I've been good to you
And I've been oh so strong
Hey ya ya ha ha

You don't spend the time when I'm in need
We don't love each other like we used to do
We don't love each other like we used to do
Running, running, running far away
You don't do the things you used to do

Hey, I'm taking my bag
And I'm running away now
'Cause you've been mean to me
And I've been good to you
And I've been oh so strong
Hey ya ya ha ha

Yes, I'm running away
Can't say I need you
Running, running, running far away
Running, running, running far away
