Two, three

The other day you said, "Hello"
We had a coffee
Now the next thing I know, you're playin' me
Was I just there for show
Cause I deserve to know
What ever happened to me

Yesterday, we were okay
Why lead me on that way
Haven't you heard of give and take

Now you think you're in the clear
Well, let me tell you, dear
Soon you'll realize your mistake

The case is closed
I don't negotiate with love
You made your choice
I won't negotiate with love
What is it you don't understand
Respect is all that I demand
You took my heart, you held my hand
So listen up and understand
Case is closed
I don't negotiate with love

Could you turn down the track a little bit, please?

Mmm

I'm thinking back in time
Startin' to realize
I could've done much better than you

I turn another page
To me you're just a phase
A time when I've learned a thing or two

The case is closed
I don't negotiate with love
You made your choice
I won't negotiate with love
What is it you don't understand
Respect is all that I demand
You took my heart, you held my hand
So listen up and understand
Case is closed
I don't negotiate with love

Case is closed
Case is closed
The case is closed
The case is closed

The case is closed
I don't negotiate with love
You made your choice
I won't negotiate with love
What is it you don't understand
Respect is all that I demand
You took my heart, you held my hand
So listen up and understand
Case is closed
I don't negotiate with love

Negotiate with love
Negotiate with love
Negotiate with love
