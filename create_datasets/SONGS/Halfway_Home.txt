You said we're halfway home
You said survive
You said we're halfway home
You said survive

Come right
Into the sunlight
'Cause I see their cold eyes
I fear they still grow
Like it was so what
As if it's so much
All through my fallen face
End to end

You said we're halfway home
You said survive

This is my horror time
This is my fallen fate
'Cause if you never run, never run
How they gonna catch you alive
'Cause if you never run, never run
How they gonna catch you alive

You said we're halfway home
You said survive
You said we're halfway home
You said survive

Dreams change and I know that I'm gonna die
But I don't need what I know now
You were beautiful my love
I see what I wanna hear

So come alive
Into the sunlight)
'Cause I see the cold eyes
And I fear they still grow

And you'll forget
Call out for a change
But not believe in anything
You will forget
Call out for a change
And not believe in anything, anything
You will forget
Call out for a change
Not believe in anything, anything
You will forget
Call out for a change
And not believe in anything

'Cause if you never run, never run
How they gonna catch you alive
'Cause if you never run, never run
How they gonna catch you alive

Yeah if you never run, never run
How they gonna catch you alive
Yeah if you never run, never run
How they gonna catch you alive
