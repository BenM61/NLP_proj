Saw your picture in the paper
My, you're looking pretty good
Looks like you're gonna make it in a big way
Oh, I always knew you would

But I should have known better, yeah
And I've should have seen sooner
There's no use pretending
I've known for a long time
Your love is ending
Caroline goodbye
Caroline goodbye

I'm not saying how or where we went wrong
Time changes 'til we get on alone
I'm left with no thoughts of the past
Here's your song to help make it last
But I should of known better
I should of seen sooner

There's no use pretending
I've known for a long time
Your love is ending
Caroline goodbye
Caroline goodbye
