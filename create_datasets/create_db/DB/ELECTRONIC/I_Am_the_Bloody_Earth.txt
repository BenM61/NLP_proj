Lay down with beasts, and welter in my gore
Fill your cups of Christ, 
I am the bloody earth
Bright, riding in heaven. 

The player in rags
White Bat is death? 
Feed it to pigs
Rise to be a king, 

Shining with power
Down silent avenues, 
I live on
Life 

You owe yours to me
Wear 
Me around your neck
Kneel 

And cry for me
Son 
Father please help me
Safe delivery of a handsome child

Merry and sweet looking
My endeavours to rise seem useless
But I will fight the distance between us
