All we have was just one summer
Two lovers strolling in the park
But like they say the world keeps turning
As the leaves were falling we should fall apart
Now I'm waiting for the winter

Nana

To build my castle out of ice and deep inside
This massive building there's a crystal lake of all the tears I cried

Baby for all my life don't you know that it's true
I'm living to love you
So baby don't think twice if you feel what I feel
Trust your heart and do what I do
'Cause I'm living to love you

I'm living to love you

When you're gone its not forever
'Cause you're remaining in my heart
So tell me why I feel this aching
Every time I think of you when we're apart

Baby for all my life don't you know that it's true
I'm living to love you
So baby don't think twice if you feel what I feel
Trust your heart and do what I do
'Cause I'm living to love you

I admit that from time to time
I'm feeling insecure and think I'm gonna lose my mind
Don't let it show, no,no no no no no
I don't think I'll ever understand that our love should never have a happy end
So, I really gonna try my best to let you know

Baby for all my life don't you know that it's true
I'm living to love you
So baby don't think twice if you feel what I feel
Trust your heart and do what I do
'Cause I'm living to love you

When the final day comes
I know the angles they will see my smile
And if they want to know the reason I will tell them why

Baby for all my life, uhu yes
I'm living to love you
