We're going to forget
All the things you could've said
Whatever's going on
Now you're standing alone

Bet I'll forget the loss
We know where you are right now
We know why you wanted somewhere to go

So now you know
Turn away
So now you know
Turn away
And now you know
You can mean what you say

So now you know
Turn away
So now you know
Turn away
And now you know
You can mean what you say

Better to forget the loss
Never let the good things go
Now just keep going when you're out in the cold

Beyond the fear of letting go
Out there on the shore tonight
That's the life you put aside for too long

So now you know
Turn away
So now you know
Turn away
And now you know
You can mean what you say

So now you know
Turn away
So now you know
Turn away
And when we go
You can mean what you say

So now you know
Turn away
So now you know
Turn away
And now you know
You can mean what you say
