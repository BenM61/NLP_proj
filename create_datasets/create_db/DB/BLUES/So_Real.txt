Love, let me sleep tonight on your couch
And remember the smell of the fabric
Of your simple city dress

Oh, that was so real
Oh, that was so real
Oh, that was so real

We walked around 'til the moon got full like a plate.
And the wind blew an invocation and I fell asleep at the gate
And I never stepped on the cracks 'cause I thought I'd hurt my mother
And I couldn't awake from the nightmare, that sucked me in and pulled me under
Pulled me under

Oh, that was so real
Oh, that was so real
Oh, that was so real

I love you
But I'm afraid to love you

I love you
But I'm afraid to love you
I'm afraid

Oh, that was so real
Oh, that was so real
Oh, that was so real

Oh, that was so real
Oh, that was so real
Oh, that was so real
Real, real, real

Oh, that was so real
Oh, that was so real

Oh, that was so real
