You want it (you want it) 
Then you better get ready 'cause this what you gon' get 
Anyway you want it 
We can take it to the WINDOW to the WALL (or better yet) 

[Chorus: x2] 
We can take it to the floor 
Tell me wat you want to do wit me 
We can take it to the floor 
Baby you don't want to fool wit me 

Now I don't know who you think you are 
But trust when I go, believe I go hard (so hard) 
So strong baby all night long 
I don't stop till the break of dawn (break of dawn) 
See ma is an all out war

'cause I got wat you're lookin for 
Have 'em comin back like GIMME SOME MORE
