Girl, I think it's time
That I let you know
About the way I really feel
I just can't wait no more
Be my baby
Be my girl 

I want to be the one
That steals your heart away
I want to hold you in my arms
And fill you with all my charms
(Be my baby)
Be my girl
(Be my girl) 

Baby, I love it when we're walkin'
Darlin', I love it when we're talkin' 

When you touch my hand
You brighten up my day
No one else can make me feel
Girl this special way
Be my baby
Be my girl
(Be my girl) 

Baby, I love it when we're walkin'
Darlin', I love it when we're talkin' 

(Be my girl, be my girl, be my girl)
Yeah
(Be my girl, be my girl, be my girl)
Girl it's for real
All this love that I feel 

Girl, I think it's time
That I let you know
About the way I really feel
I just can't wait no more
Be my baby
Be my girl 

Won't you be my girl
(Be my girl, be my girl, be my girl)
Be my girl, baby
(Be my girl, be my girl, be my girl)
Repeat and fade
