Your lips come as some surprise
That they would want to come and meet mine
They never taste like the last time
Your lips come as some surprise

I was always a special child
With circuit boards for my insides
And all I dreamed of was flying high
So your lips came as some surprise

Your lips come as some surprise
That they would want to come and meet mine
They never taste like the last time
Your lips come as some surprise

I was never one of the boys
Throwing shapes and power ploys
In your arms a warmth I did find
In your seed I did recline

Your lips come as some surprise
That they would want to come and meet mine
They never taste like the last time
Your lips come as some surprise

Now that we've sat for a while
You showed me yours and I've showed you mine
Even after all this time
Your lips come as some surprise

Your lips come as some surprise
That they would want to come and meet mine
They never taste like the last time
Your lips come as some surprise
