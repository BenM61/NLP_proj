Innocent, and in a sense I am
Guilty of the crime that's now in hand
Such a nice day
Throw your life away
Such a nice day
Let it go

Cold these eyes, I can't believe it
Cold, this heart is slow
Heart is slow

Call me
Such a cold heart
Such a cold man
Watch you tear your self apart

So lay me down
My soul to give
So lay me down
The longest sleep
Oh, the longest sleep

In I come and out you go you get
Here we are again now, place your bets
Is this the time
The time to win or lose
Is this the time
The time to choose

Cold these eyes, I can't believe it
So deep inside a cold fire
Cold, this heart is slow

Anytime you're only a kiss away
Won't you do it now
That's right, just keep me going

In some white track
You come the right track
Cartoon cutout
Cut throat bled out
I'm on your side
Be on the both side
I'm alright Jack
You get off my back
I'm no dope
I give you hope
Here's the rope
Here's the rope
Now swing away
