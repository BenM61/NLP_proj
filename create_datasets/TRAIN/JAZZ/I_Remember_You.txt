Was it in Tahiti?
Were we on the Nile?
Long, long ago
Singing our, our song
I recall that I saw you smile

I remember you
You're the one who made my dreams come true
A few kisses ago

I remember you
You're the one who said
I love you too
Didn't you know

I remember too a distant bell
And stars that fell
Like rain out of the blue

When my life is through
And the angels ask me
To recall
The thrill of them all
Then I shall tell them
I remember You

I remember too a distant bell
And stars that fell 
Like rain out of the blue

When my life is through
And the angels ask me
To recall
The thrill of them all
Then I shall tell them
I remember you

If they should ask
I'll gladly tell them
I remember you
