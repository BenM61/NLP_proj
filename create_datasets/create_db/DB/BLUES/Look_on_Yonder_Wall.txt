Look on yonder wall and hand me down my walkin' cane 
Look on yonder wall and hand me down my walkin' cane 
I got me another woman, baby, yon' come your man 

Look on yonder wall and hand me down my walkin' cane 
Look on yonder wall and hand me down my walkin' cane 
I got me another woman and, uhh, baby, yon' come your man 

You hurried up and went to the wall, 
And you know it was tough, uhh 
I don't know how many men you's killed, 
But, I know you done killed enough for two 
Look on yonder wall and hand me down my walkin' cane 
Look on yonder wall and hand me down my walkin' cane 
I got me another woman, now baby, yon' come your man 

Oh yeah 
I love you baby, but you just can't treat me right, 
Spend all my money and walk the streets all night 
But, look on yonder wall and hand me down my walkin' cane 
I got me another woman, and baby, yon' come your man
