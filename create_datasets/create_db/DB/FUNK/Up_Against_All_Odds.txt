Our love, the only thing that's true
Has stood the test of time
They said we would never last
But we followed our hearts and let God direct the path

Up against all odds, we were standing up against all odds
Trusting and believing in the miracles of love
Even if it seems to be so hard to reach for the dream that is so far
Never lose your faith in love when you're up against all odds

Life can take you through rough times
But still you will pull through
Hold on to your hopes and dreams
And there's nothing that you can not do, whoa

Up against all odds, we were standing up against all odds
Trusting and believing in the miracles of love
Even if it seems to be so hard to reach for the dream that is so far
Never lose your faith in love when you're up against all odds

Oh, dreams come, dreams go
Only if you don't believe
If we ever stopped to think that we could come so far
Through it all we will go on

Up against all odds, we were standing up against all odds
Trusting and believing in miracles of love
Even if it seems to be so hard to reach for the dream that is so far
Never lose your faith in love when you're up against all odds
Never lose your faith in love when you're up against all odds
