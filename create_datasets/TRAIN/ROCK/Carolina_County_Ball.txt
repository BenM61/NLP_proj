Well just imagine my surprise to be there
If you touched me with a feather I'd fall
I guess that you could say we finally made it
We played the Carolina County Ball

We had the ladies all in line to see us
I must have promised twenty seven I'd call
We thought the sun was never gonna stop shining
On the Carolina County Ball

We played it hot, hard and nasty, oh yeah
At the Carolina County Ball
ooooo
When you got it sailing really wailing
It's all right, o-oh right

Oh right
Yeah

Well just imagine my surprise to be there
If you touched me with a feather I'd fall
We thought the sun was never gonna stop shining
Down on the Carolina County Ball

We played it hot and hard, nasty, oh yeah
At the Carolina County Ball
And we sang, yeah, ooooo
On a boogie woogie Friday night, it's all right
Ooooo
When you got it sailing, really wailing, it's all right
All right
Oh yeah

Hey, Doo-o-oo
On a boogie woogie Friday night
Doo-o-o
Say, everything gotta be all right
Doo-o-o
It's a boogie woogie Friday night, hey
Doo-o-o
When you got it sailing, really wailing
It's all right, go ahead

Oh, Doo-o-o
On the boogie woogie Friday night
Doo-o-o
Say, everything gotta be all - so - right
Doo-o-o
It's a boogie woogie Friday night
Doo-o-o
When you got it sailing, really wailing
Hypnotising, tantalising
Carolina County Ball and it's all right
