When I come up I want to see
Out of my hips all inside me
Should I hold on
Before it's almost over
You gave to me a famous cold shoulder
I jump for you table for two

Do you get high from his eyes?
Morning my boy in my arms
I turn to him to see you
Do you get high?

You take it all just exhale in
I kiss the mouth we made for him
So happy sad I'm everything
He shuts his eyes to hear me sing
He's getting tired for the day

Do you get high from his eyes?
Morning my boy in my arms
I turn to him to see you
Do you get high?

Do you get high from his eyes?
Morning my boy in my arms
I turn to him to see you
Do you get high?

Do you get high from his eyes?
Morning my boy in my arms
I turn to him to see you
Do you get high?

Do you get high from his eyes?
Morning my boy in my arms
I turn to him & see you
Do you get high?

When I come up I want to see...
