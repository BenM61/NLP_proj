The street where you lived
Houses all gone
Run-down state
Where once was your home

I found the church where you went
And I stood where you stood
It didn't feel the same
But I came back again
I knew I would

It sounds like the country
If you did enough
Here all around me
My family ghosts

Each day I walk up this hill
The one you took to the fair
And I imagine you there
I see your hair

It's too long ago now
To be undone
A second (?)
What's gone is gone

I pushed open the door
And I stood where you stood
I tried not to blink
And I tried not to think
I had one more drink
I knew I would
