Stay focused on me, it's so good it's hard to breathe
I'm ready to go, pull my hair until I scream

Stay focused on me, tell you how it's gon' be
You's a sexy motherfucker, introduce me to your mother

I'ma touch it if I want, we ain't doin' nothin' wrong
Can't do this alone, keep it goin' all night long

I can touch it if I want, you gon' miss me when I'm gone
Hit me on my celly, love it when you tell me-

Touch it (you know I will)
Let me know you want it (okay)
'Cause I'm a maniac
Don't rush it (aaahh)
Let me see that you've got it
C-c-cause I'm a maniac

Now that you're in front of me, I'ma put that ass to sleep
You can feel it in your knees, thought it wasn't, pssht please

Now that you in front of me, I'ma show you I'ma freak
Ready to explode, show you things you've never seen

Now you've got yours and I've got mine, you're my girly on the side
You know I do it well, don't go playin' kiss and tell

Now you've got yours and I've got mine, don't go home and call your guys
(Keep it on the low), we can do this all the time

Touch it (you know I will)
Let me know you want it (okay)
'Cause I'm a maniac
Don't rush it (aaahh)
Let me see that you've got it
C-c-cause I'm a maniac

Touch it (you know I will)
Let me know you want it (okay)
'Cause I'm a maniac
Don't rush it (aaahh)
Let me see that you've got it

You know I'm ready
You know I'm ready ready
You know I'm ready
You know I'm ready to go
You know I'm ready
You know I'm ready ready
You know I'm ready
You know I'm ready to go

Touch it (you know I will)
Let me know you want it (okay)
