I entered the house
On the hill one day
Trying my best just to get away
No one was home
But the voices were clear
They let me know
I was welcome here

Life is so wonderful
Life is so beautiful
Stay a wile
No one gets out alive
Life is so wonderful
Life is so beautiful
Just smile
No one gets out alive

I walked down the halls
Of that haunted place
A whisper was leading me
Through the maze
Promising warmth
Knowing my name
Knowing my reasons
And why I came

A face in a painting
Looked down on me
Smiled at me loving and tenderly
Reached out her hand
Stroking my hair
Suddenly voices were everywhere
