There I go again
Falling in love again
Knew better just like before but
Here I go

'Cause that's when you came to me
And you saved my life now
I was just a boy
When I knew you didn't need [?]
But with you I swear it feels
Just like heaven
Feels like heaven

Been down that road before
Every signpost that I ignore
Gotta make it work out someway
Here I go

I'll be your dreamboat lover and roll the dice
We'll shine in paradise
Get to know the things you fantasize
With you I swear it feels
It feels like heaven
It feels like heaven

I'll be your dreamboat lover and roll the dice
We'll shine in paradise
Get to know the things you fantasize
With you I swear it feels
It feels like heaven
It feels like heaven
