Oh, I'm playing this morning 
Please don't let those jet-engines start 

Oh, I'm playing this morning 
Please, please don't let those jet-engines start 

When I hear your engines goin' 
You know, it almost drives me out of my mind 

Oh, but the last few morings lately 
Before I get out of my bed 

Oh, but the last few morings lately 
Just before I get out of my bed 

You know I can hear your engines goin' 
And it almost drives me out of my head 

Oh, but the last few morings lately 
Before, before I get out of my bed 

Oh, but the last, but the last, but the last few morings lately 
Before, before I get out of my bed 

Well, you know I can hear your engines goin' 
You know, it almost drives me out of my head
