Give love a chance.
Give love a chance.
Give love a chance to shine all through the earth.

If we would all put hate aside,
Then we might live to see love have a chance.

Give love a chance.
Give love a chance.
Give love a chance to shine all through the earth.

If we would all put hate aside,
Then we might live to see love have a chance.

Give love a chance.
Give love a chance.
