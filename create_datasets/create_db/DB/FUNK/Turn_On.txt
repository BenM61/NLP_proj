Turn it on

Have you been thinking nothing ever changes
And you could be making a difference tonight?
Why are you waiting, anticipating?
Can't fight the feeling when you know it's right

Oh, I just want to see you smile
Forget about yesterday
Nothing can stop you now
So what are you waiting for?

Turn it on, turn on the beat box
Baby, we're walking on the party line
Crank it up and let the music
Turn every night into a Saturday night

Whenever you're ready, we'll be rocking steady
You're gonna get lucky, leaving it all behind
Time's ticking away, it's another Saturday
So it's time to break out on the party line

Oh, I just want to see you smile
Forget about yesterday
Nothing can stop you now
So what are you waiting for?

Turn it on, turn on the beat box
Baby, we're walking on the party line
Crank it up and let the music
Turn every night into a Saturday night

It's alright, turn on the beat box
Babe, are you ready for a good time?
So come on, move with the feeling
Every night is a Saturday night
