And I feel so lonesome, you hear me when I moan
And  I feel so lonesome, you hear me when I moan
Who been drivin' my Terraplane for you since I been gone?

I'd said I flash your lights, mama, you horn won't even blow
Somebody's been runnin' my batteries down on this machine
I even flash my lights, mama, this horn won't even blow
Got a short in this connection, hoo well, babe, it's way down below

I'm goin' heist your hood, mama, I'm bound to check your oil
I'm goin' heist your hood, mama, mmm, I'm bound to check your oil
I got a woman that I'm lovin', way down in Arkansas

Now, you know the coils ain't even buzzin', little generator won't get the spark
Motor's in a bad condition, you gotta have these batteries charged
But I'm cryin', please, please don't do me wrong
Who been drivin' my Terraplane now for you since I been gone?

Mr. highway man, please don't block the road
Please, please don't block the road
'Cause she's reachin' a cold one hundred and I'm booked and I got to go

Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
You, you hear me weep and moan
Who been drivin' my Terraplane now for you since I been gone?

I'm gon' get down in this connection, keep on tanglin' with your wires
I'm gon' get down in this connection, oh well, keep on tanglin' with these wires
And when I mash down on your little starter, then your sparkplug will give me fire
