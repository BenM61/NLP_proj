Why deal? 
And then appeal? 
To pirate along 
And it's not alive 
I don't know if I can lead 
The wielder beast 
And he's white 
Soggy lies 
And I'm awake 
It's hot in here tonight 
And there's not a lot of light
What are you? 
And what is he? 
Apposed to work 
And I sit aloud 
Moats of rays 
And in my way 
The wings collide 
And it's lonely 
Seems to be 
That we could eat 
The world of war 
And I'm wound
