You paint my world shades of gray
Left me here to suffocate
Knocked me down off my high horse
Crying out "Oh my Lord"
Nothing seems to numb the pain
Pills they just don't work the same
No matter how much I take
I need you to recuperate

Walking around, head down
Heart full of sorrow
Nobody can guarantee tomorrow
If you don't come back ASAP
Tonight I'll drink my love away

They think I'm here to celebrate
I'm smiling but I'm not okay
I'm drinking now to stop the flame
My heart's on fire and you're the pain
If you were here tonight
I wouldn't let you out of sight
Without you I'm lonely
Never felt so lonely

Walking around, head down
Heart full of sorrow
Nobody can guarantee tomorrow
If you don't come back ASAP
Tonight I'll drink my love away

(If you were here tonight
I wouldn't let you out of sight)

Walking around, head down
Heart full of sorrow
Nobody can guarantee tomorrow
If you don't come back ASAP
Tonight I'll drink my love away

Tonight I'll drink my love away
Tonight I'll drink my love away
