I never see the light
Still I follow you
Couldn't imagine how
Or what I'm supposed to do

Ah maybe I've been crazy
Only thinking of you
I'll do it again

Through the longest nights
And I know them so well
I keep forgetting my place
And I stumbled til I fell

So easy it's so easy
To never see the truth
Do you remember

I said to give you
Everything in my heart
Give you everything in my heart
Give you everything in my heart
(i said) for you

And sometimes when my heart is so cold
And you cut me out and you're so hard to hold
I keep searching
I want to get through to you

I keep on searching
I want to break through to you
Again and again

Oh maybe I've been crazy
Only thinking of you
But I'll do it again

To give you everything in my heart
Give you everything in my heart
Give you everything in my soul
(I said) for you, and I'll do it again

Give you everything in my heart
Give you everything in my heart
Even though, everything in my soul
(I said) for you and I'll do it again

Everything in my heart
