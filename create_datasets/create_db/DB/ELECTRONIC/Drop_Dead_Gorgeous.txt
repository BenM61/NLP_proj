Yeah yeah
Backward words, he got em
Shut up, I'm talking
This time, you'll listen
But when I look at you you're forgiven
You drive too fast and
I smoke too much and
My heart is broken
But when I look at you you're forgiven
You're forgiven
I know my ex-boyfriend lies
Oh he does it every time
It's just his permanent disguise
Yeah yeah but he's drop dead gorgeous
Don't go changing every time
Not for me to compromise
You're still a friend of mine
Yeah yeah and you're drop dead gorgeous
Yeah
End of, stop sulking
Get out, you're walkin'
Too bad, I've spoken
But when I look at you you're forgiven
Your lies, don't want em
Drop dead, not joking
This thing is broken
But when I look at you you're forgiven
You're forgiven
I know my ex-boyfriend lies
Oh he does it every time
It's just his permanent disguise
Yeah yeah but he's drop dead gorgeous
Don't go changing every time
Not for me to compromise
You're still a friend of mine
Yeah yeah and you're drop dead gorgeous
Yeah yeah
I know my ex-boyfriend lies
Oh he does it every time
