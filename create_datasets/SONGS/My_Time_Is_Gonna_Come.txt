Load up your bullets
Shot me through the head
Gasp from where your standing
You might think I'm dead
When I hit the ground
Look at me bleed
Old man your sympathy is something I don't need

My time is gonna come (Yeah)
My time is gonna come (Yeah)
I walk from the shadows, and I walk in the sun
My time is gonna come (Yeah)
My time is gonna come (Yeah)
Somewhere is paradise and I found me some.
Oh yeah

You can laugh at me now
Sticker on your face
Theirs always someone bigger, trying to take my place
You can go to sleep
Be madam Dan
Wakeup tomorrow find my gun is at your head

My time is gonna come (Yeah)
My time is gonna come (Yeah)
I walk from the shadows, and I walk in the sun
My time is gonna come (Yeah)
My time is gonna come (Yeah)
Somewhere is paradise and I found me some.
Oh yeah

I say something nice
Give you a heart attack
I smile to your face. then I stab you in the back
When I turn away
Your poison in my tea
That won't kill me boy taste like sugar in me.

My time is gonna come (Yeah)
My time is gonna come (Yeah)
I walk from the shadows, and I walk in the sun
My time is gonna come (Yeah)
My time is gonna come (Yeah)
Somewhere is paradise and I found me some.
Oh yeah

Time is (Gonna come)
Time is (Gonna come)
Time is (Gonna come)
Time is (Gonna come)
