A message sent to ensure that this world is a tragic place
Still filled with ignorance
And we can no longer hide behind false smiles
That once were saving us

Killing all the innocence
We wave goodbye to those times
And we will begin again
Can you hear the child cry to me

They always seem to cut like knives in my heart
I still believe
If you can find it in the good of humanity
Killing all the innocence

We wave goodbye to those times
And who will begin again
have we reached the end
What is wrong with humanity
