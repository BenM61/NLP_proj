I see you passing by 
I don't where 
I don't know why 
You choose to go the way that you're going now 
You've been a friend of mine for many years for a long time, but... 
You just aren't you today, so what's on your mind 
You just won't speak abut it 
think about it 
be about it 
Gotta make yourself aware that you're goin' astray 
You're trying so hard to fit in 

What you need is something genuine 
What you want is something real 
What you you need is something truthful 
I know you do 
I know you do 
I know you do 
'Cause I need it too... 
What you need 
What you need 
What you want 
What you want 
What you need 
What you need 
Something Genuine. 

You cry yourself to sleep 
Sleep at night but once the night is gone 
And you prepare to face a brand new day 
You hide yourself behind that mastermind 
You're in disguise 
It's as if you try to put a mask on your pain 

You Don't know who you are 
What you're about 
where are you now 
You're becoming someone that you don't want to be 
You're trying so hard to fit in

What you need is something genuine 
What you want is something real 
What you you need is something truthful 
I know you do 
I know you do 
I know you do 
'Cause I need it too... 
What you need 
What you need 
What you want 
What you want 
What you need 
What you need 
Something genuine. 

He loves you for who you are now and who you will be 
Don't fear living in truth there's reality 
I don't have all the asnwers but I know One who does 
And I know there's freedom and truth 
I got to Him because 

What you need is something genuine 
What you want is something real 
What you you need is something truthful 
I know you do 
I know you do 
I know you do 
'Cause I need it too
What you need 
What you need 
What you want 
What you want 
What you need 
What you need 
Something genuine. 

What He has is something genuine 
Who He is is someone real 
What He gives is something truthful 
Its what He has its Who he is 
Its what He gives 
And I need Him too 
What you need 
What you need 
I Need Him Too 
What you want  
What you want 
What you need 
What you need 
Something genuine.
