Darling if you've been a hurting
I don't care what it is
I want to help for certain, but it takes more than a kiss
All this love and affection
I'm feeling for you now
Send it back in my direction, girl
I can show you how 

My love is coming on strong
And you know, you've been gone away too long 

Bring back, bring back your lovin' to me
Bring back, bring back your lovin' to me 

All that words that passed between us
Spoken in haste
Could have gone back and forth to Venus
For all the time we waste
Staying angry at each other
Sometimes just for anger's sake
I don't want no other lover
I got too much here at stake 

Our love is worth fighting for
And you know it, even as you close that door 

Every night I sit and watch for you, baby
I pray to God you haven't found somebody else
But I could never care, like I care for you
When I hurt you girl, well I just can't stand myself 

They say pride will be our downfall
Girl I've swallowed mine
I'm begging you, baby, come back
And I will tow the line
To the top of the Eiffel Tower
To the bottom of the sea
If it means just one more hour
Your love will shine on me 

Our love is worth fighting for
And you know it, even as you close that door 

Bring back, bring back your lovin' to me
Bright it right back here baby
Bring back, bring back your lovin' to me
I want you sweet lovin' right now
