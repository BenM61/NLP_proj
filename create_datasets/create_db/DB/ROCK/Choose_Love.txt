Dark clouds in my head dis appear
The sky is turning blue now you're here
We've come a long way day after day (we still got a long way to go)
You've got to pay your dues if you want to sing the blues
But, no matter what you choose choose love

The Long and Winding Road is more than a song
Tomorrow Never Knows What Goes On
To live your life right you've got to let in the light and let all the darkness go
You've got to pay your dues if you want to sing the blues
But, no matter who you choose choose love

Love love love love love 
Choose love!

You've got to pay your dues if you want to sing the blues
But, no matter how you choose choose love
You've got to pay your dues if you want to sing the blues
But, no matter what you choose choose love

Choose love choose love choose love
