My heart is like an artichoke
I eat petals myself one by one
Until I feel enough
Until I lose to laugh

When I end to eat the last one
I will tear my drops
I will lose my lips

Though I can't stop plucking off
I can't see my core
I keep asking for you more and more

Can you peel my petals one by one?
Your hands are like a rusty knife
Are you gonna keep on peeling me?
Are you gonna keep on peeling me?
Are you gonna keep on peeling me?

What am I gonna be on the pan?
Will I be burnt black?
Can you squeeze a lemon on me?
A lemon on me?

Baby, baby, everything you want to feel
Baby, baby, everything you want to taste
Baby, baby, everything you want to feel
Baby, baby, everything you want to taste.
