Don't forget me 
Remember me

[Chorus]
Sending you forget-me-nots
To help me to remember
Baby please forget-me-not
I want you to remember
Sending you forget-me-nots
To help me to remember
Baby please forget-me-not
I want you to remember

Those were the times we had,
Sharing the joy that we thought would last.
Memories of love and affection,
Love for me was like a dream.
Was it the simple things that made me so crazy about you?
Was it your charm or your passion?
It's not hard to believe I want you and I need you!
So I'm

[Chorus]

Did we give up to soon
Maybe we just needed a little room
Wondering how it all happened
Maybe we just need a little time
Though we did end up friends
Give it a chance, we could love again
I'll always love you forever
It's not hard to believe I want you and I need you
So I'm

[Chorus:Repeat x2]
Don't forget me.
