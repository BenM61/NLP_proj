Once I was a villain
I behaved just like a cat
But like a shot of penicillin
She cured me of all that
She's a healthy dose of heaven
For a man that's hooked on sin
Let the joy begin

Better get used to it, baby

If I was a begger
I would beg ten million dimes
I would have a million dollars
For a minute of your time
I would walk across the desert
Eating dust and sand
If that was your command

Better get used to it, baby

And if you never tell me
You care just how I feel
It's a dying man's last meal

You better get used to it, baby
Better get used to it, baby
