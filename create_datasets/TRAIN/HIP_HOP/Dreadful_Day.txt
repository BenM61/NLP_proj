(Junior Reid) 

Thinking why 
Standing here thinking why standing here thinking why (x6) 
It was a dreadful day  yeah 
Babylon take me away  why 
Down to Riker's Island donde 
This is what I see every day, oh yeah 
Use razor cutters to cut matches in four 
Cause I not sure to get no more 
No no more 
No no more 

(Wise Intelligent) 
Witness the days and be real 
The days of boys and rappers 
Soul snatchers, gun clappers, and bloodsucking crackers 
The body catchers who keep their weapons pointed at ya 
The life subtracters, the poison animal eating slackers 
Nobody move, nobody bleed as I proceed 
I beg you heed this thing me talk with Junior Reid 
You load your clip, you cock your shit get on your way 
You're guaranteed to murder something today 
From Riker's Island to Sing Sing and San Quentin 
You're touring prisons, result of all that bullshitting 
But now you're bitching, better sharpen up that ice pick and 
Proceed to stick him or kiss your stupid ass good riddance 

(Junior Reid) 

Take me from my wonderful home, oh 
Carry me to here in Rome, no 
Someone's smart will use one comb 
Mine'll make a knife 
About to get fleas and lice 
Tonight 
The man who smoke and bruise lose 
They'll always have a next men to use 
Peep the gangsta man, why-oy 
Of this operation, why-oy 
Brutalization, why-oy 
Love to the nation, why-oy 

(Wise Intelligent) 

True 
That day they took me away they had me bound in shackles 
Locked down tweleve brothers connected by the ankles 
By chains we dangled imprisoned for the star spangled 
Banner for glamour mad motherfucker's slammer 
Just like the streets there's niggas in here wildin' out and dying 
You can receive any drugs that you want to try and 
The only difference between the streets and prison living 
Are homosexuals, the closest you can get to women 
And I ain't 'bout to demote the self and go that route 
I've been here two years, one week and I want out 
When will it cease, this way of death ain't fit for beasts 
I fail to see a correctional facility 

(Junior Reid) 

It was a dreadful day 
Eradication take me away 
Take me to a penitentiary 
This is what I see every day, oh yeah 
Use razor cutters to cut matches in four 
Cause me not sure to get no more 
No no more why-oy 
No no more yeah 
Ten men smoke once leave dayy 
Don't mean we on stage eight 
Look me eye no red 
Like wild monkey weed I'm dead, dead 
Poor Righetous Teacher 
And Junior Reid sensei 
We want to see the sun rise 
In the land of the rising sun 

It was a dreadful day 
Babylon take me away 
Down to Riker's Island donde 
This is what I see every day, oh yeah 
This is what I see every day 
This is what I see every day 

Life in a jailhouse, life so rough 
Life in a jailhouse so tough 
So rough
