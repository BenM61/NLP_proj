I'm standing here
I said "Love, you'd listen, uh hunh?"
May love get here when you answer
I thought he'd known loving before
He's so mean to her
If only had he held on
He'd be along side with you so guarded

He didn't love me back
He holded me out
He didn't love me back
He didn't love me back

I've been here
Here with more than he asked from her
And I have got what you needed for your heart
He gave me love
He hit me
He loved you, you know

He didn't love me back
He holded me out
He didn't love me back
He didn't love me back
He didn't love me back
