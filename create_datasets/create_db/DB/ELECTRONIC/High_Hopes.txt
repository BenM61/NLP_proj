You've got me like no one has before, I really love you 
The way you talk and the things you say sound so good 
But there you were standing over there with another last night 
Now in the middle of it can't you see it's killin' me 

I had high hopes for you and me 
Thought we'd stay together eternally 
High hopes for our love 
Felt like it was heaven sent from above 

Oh 
Just too hard to let go 

You told me you loved nobody else, you never would 
You had my child, you'd even marry me if I asked 
But now it seems more so every day that you need me less 
Now you're almost there, come around, I don't wanna let you go, oh, oh

I had high hopes for you and me 
Thought we'd stay together eternally 
High hopes for our love 
Felt like it was heaven sent from above 

(High) This can't be 
Caught you with another and, girl, it's killin' me 
(High) You let me down 
I have to find somebody else since you won't be around 

Just need a little time, it'll be alright 

High hopes 
High hopes 

Can't you see, I want you for myself (And always will) 
We had our talk and tried to make things right, or so it seems 
But it's him for you, I guess you don't need me anymore 
Hey, I never ever come around to see you again, oh (Oh, oh) 

'Cause I had high hopes for you and me 
Thought we'd stay together eternally 
High hopes for our love 
Felt like it was heaven sent from above 

(High) Ooh, this can't be 
Caught you with another and, girl, it's killin' me 
(High) You let me down 
I have to find somebody else since you won't be around 

High hopes 
Just need a little time and I'll be alright 
High hopes 
Oh, oh, high, high, high 

High hopes 
It's so hard to let go 
High hopes
