Well I don't know why I was dreaming about you
But I do know that I was dancing without you
Then you smiled, and I was lost
You fall in love, why count the cost?

All I gave to you
All you made me do
I react when I hear people ask

Was it worth it?
Yes it's worth living for
Was it worth it?
Yes it's worth giving more

If I'd had my way this would have happened much sooner
But until that day it was only a rumor
All at once you changed my life
And led me in to paradise

Where I had to do
What I wanted to
I react when I hear people ask

Was it worth it?
Yes it's worth living for
Was it worth it?
Yes it's worth giving more

I reserve the right to live
My life this way, and I don't give
A damn when I hear people say
I'll pay the price that others pay

'Cause it's worth it
Yes it's worth living for
'Cause it's worth it
Yes it's worth living for

All I gave to you
All you made me do
I react when I hear people ask

Was it worth it?
Yes it's worth living for
Was it worth it?
Yes it's worth giving more

And I reserve (what?)
The right to live (where?)
My life this way (how?)
I couldn't give
A damn when I (what?)
Hear people say (who?)
I'll pay the price
That others pay

'Cause it's worth it
Yes it's worth living for
'Cause it's worth it
Yes it's worth giving more
And it's worth it

I don't know why
I never thought I'd fall in love
I don't know why
I don't know why
I never thought I'd fall in love
I don't know why
I don't know why
