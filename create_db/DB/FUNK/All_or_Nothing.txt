I gotta have all or nothing baby 
Believe it there's no limit 
You want to be my lady 
Its all or nothing to ice

I told you from the start
Just how things would be
Expectation for the one
Who would be with me
Now I tell you once again
I hope you understand
Just what you have to do
If you want a second chance
I don't need a fool around kind of woman
A woman who just can't be
Happy and devoted
Just to me
I need a one of ten kind of woman
A woman that I can trust
Who is grateful and concerned
About us 

I gotta have all or nothing baby 
Believe it there's no limit 
You want to be my lady 
Its all or nothing to ice

A styless kind of woman
Whose class looks real good
Treats her man the way that she should
One who would give me all her love
One who will have me wanting more
That's the kind of woman I'm looking for
I don't need a fool around kind of woman
A woman who just can't be
Happy and devoted just to me
I need a one of ten kind of woman 
A woman that I can trust
Who is grateful and concerned
About us yeah

I gotta have all or nothing baby 
Believe it there's no limit 
You want to be my lady 
Its all or nothing to ice

I need someone yeah 
Someone to hold me tight

[Repeat]
I gotta have all or nothing baby 
Believe it there's no limit 
You want to be my lady 
Its all or nothing to ice
