Wild wild young men they like to have a good time
They chase too many women they drink to much wine
Going for a wild ride stomping on the gas
Walking on the wild side living way too fast
Playing in hot game they ain't never gonna win
Wild wild young men
Wild wild young men

Wild wild young men like to party down
They got money in their pocket they're gonna spread it around
They try to make a big point of acting like a fool
Hanging out in the juke joints trying to be real cool
They're bound to come to some bad end
Wild wild young men
Wild wild young men

Young girl let me tell you don't give your heart
To no wild wild young man cause he'll tear it apart
You ain't nothing but a sweet toy put your head in a spin
He's just a honky tonk cowboy a feather in the wind
Don't care about no one but his so called friends
Wild wild young men
