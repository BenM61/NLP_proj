I walked around my good intentions
And found that there were none
I blame my father for the wasted years, we hardly talked
I never thought I would forget this hate

Then a phone call made me realize I'm wrong
And if I don't make it known that I've loved you all along
Just like sunny days that we ignore
Because we're all dumb and jaded
And, and I hope to God I figure out what's wrong

I walked around my room not thinking
Just sinking in this box
I blame myself for being too much, like somebody else
I never thought I would just bend this way

Then a phone call made me realize I'm wrong
And if I don't make it known that I've loved you all along
Just like sunny days that we ignore
Because we're all dumb and jaded
And, and I hope to God I figure out what's wrong

And I hope to God I figure out what's wrong
And I hope to God I figure out what's wrong

If I don't make it known that I've loved you all along
Just like sunny days that we ignore
Because we're all dumb and jaded
And I hope to God I figure out what's wrong

And if I don't make it known that I've loved you all along
Just like sunny days that we ignore
Because we're all dumb and jaded
And, and I hope to God I figure out what's wrong
