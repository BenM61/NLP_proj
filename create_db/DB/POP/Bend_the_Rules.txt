Bend The Rules

I'm used to being scared, from time to time
Used to redefining, my way of life
'Cause nothing really stays the same
Nothing ever will

But lately I have come, to realize
That voice inside my head, belongs to me
Now everything is pros, and cons
Ignorance is gone

I'm clinging to my timeâ?¦

There's something in the air, I breathe tonight
Everything gets stock, in black and white
Everything is ups, and downs
Every single thing

(Chorus 1)
Back in the days, when we were Gods
And we took everything for granted - for granted
And we were wild, and we were young
We bent the rules, and took our chances - our chances

But I'm not really close, to giving in
I'm fighting every pound, and every inch
Losing every day I live
Every single day

But I don't wanna feel, the way I do
I don't wanna say, the things I do
I just wanna stay right here
Blinded but sincere

(Chorus 2)
These are the days, when we are Gods
And we take everything for granted - for granted
And we are wild, and we are young
We f*ck the rules, and take our chances - our chances

There's something in the airâ?¦
There's something in the airâ?¦
