Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back again
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back again
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back again
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back again

I cruise around with the radio on
Make me feel alright, make me feel alright
Wide open highway and the sun going down
Make me feel alright, make me feel alright

You'd grab the guitar and pick out a song
You'd wear that pretty dress, we never could go wrong
We had no money but never seem to care
Our love took us everywhere

Bring it back again
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back again
Bring it back again
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back again

I cruise around in a rag top ride
Make me feel alright, make me feel alright
But now I've got no one by my side
Make me feel alright, make me feel alright

Though I know it could never be the same
I need your little hand to hold in mine again
Won't you tell me you still feel the same?
Give me your love back again

Bring it back again
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back again
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back again

Is it any wonder, why I love you so?
Oh, you were my first love
When your eyes met mine
My heart (incomprehensible) for all time

Oh, bring it back again
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back again
Bring it back again
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back again

I cruise around with the radio on
Make me feel alright, make me feel alright
But now I've got no one by my side
Make me feel alright, make me feel alright

Though I know it could never be the same
I need your little hand to hold in mine again
Won't you tell me that you feel the same?
Give me your love back again

Bring it back again
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back again
Bring it back again
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back again

Bring it back again
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back again
Bring it back again
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back again
