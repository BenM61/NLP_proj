I see the light 
I see the light at the end of the tunnel 
I see the light and it's burnin' bright 
I see the light it's the light at the end that I run to 
And the light, darlin' is you 

In the lonely heart of darkness 
I have stumbled and I have strayed 
Always searchin' but never finding 
A ray of sunlight to guide my way 

I see the light 
I see the light at the end of the tunnel 
I see the light and it's burnin' bright 
I see the light it's the light at the end that I run to 
And the light, darlin' is you 

I have travelled down this highway 
Of hope abandoned and broken dreams 
An unbeliever my faith was shaken 
By all the sorrow I had seen 

I see the light 
I see the light at the end of the tunnel 
I see the light and it's burnin' bright 
I see the light it's the light at the end that I run to 
And the light, darlin' is you 
And the light, darlin' is you
