M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E

In the moonlite
Under startlite
Songs old as the night
Are what I've been dreamin' of
Everybody's hard as iron
Locked in a modern world
Dreams are make of a different stuff
I believe love will always be the same
The ways and means are the parts subject to change

M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
It's a method of modern love
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
It's a method of modern love

I can call you
Got your number
Share my life with you
A thousand miles away
If you've hurt me
I haven't shown it
Time's too tight to fight
And we're never face to face
Style is timeless and fashion's only now
We are the ways no one needs to show us how

M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
It's a method of modern love
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
It's a method of modern love

Method of, method of
Love, love, love
Love
Method of, method of
Love, love, love
Love
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
It's modern love
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
I know what you're dreaming of
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
What we got is a method of
Modern love
It's a method of
It's a method of
Modern love
We know what we do, or don't we
We know what we do, or don't we
In the moonlight
In the starlite
Songs old as the night
Are what I've been dreamin' of
It's a method of
Modern love
Dreams are made of a different stuff and we're living
In a method of modern love
At present tense has no time behind
Oh don't fall for the same whole life
M-E-T-H-O-D -O-F-L-O-V-E

Don't you know that it's a method of
Modern love?
I've got the way we works
I've got a way we run

And you believe that I'm in a gladly age and not behind

I got the method
Baby
And it's right on time
It's a method of
Modern love
It's a method of
Modern love
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
I know what you're dreaming of
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
It's a method of
Modern love
