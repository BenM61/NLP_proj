There are things
I have done
There's a place
I have gone
There's a beast
And I let it run
Now it's running
My way

There are things
I regret
To can't forgive
You can't forget
There's a gift
That you sent
You sent it
My way

So take this night
Wrap it around me like a sheet
I know I'm not forgiven
But I need a place to sleep
So take this night
And lay me down on the street
I know I'm not forgiven
But I hope that I'll be given
Some peace

There's a game
That I play
There are rules
I had to break
There's mistakes
That I made
But I made them
My way

So take this night
Wrap it around me like a sheet
I know I'm not forgiven
But I need a place to sleep
So take this night
And lay me down on the street
I know I'm not forgiven
But I hope that I'll be given
Some peace

Some peace
Some peace
