(What's wrong with you, man?
You crazy)

I don't claim that Shan's the epitome
Your rhymes can't ban so you can't get rid of me
Line after line has a cause and effect
But I first test the mic with the 1-2 check
The hip-hop world made the Juice Crew orphans
Gained our respect sealin up much coffins
We're all obligated to Juice Crew Laws
You'se a perk if you let a man take yours
Number 2 is not to follow, yo, you must set trends
And if you ain't down with us, you can't be friends
Many of my so-called boys just flipped
But the thrill of it all - you're on the tip
Glad there is no tricks
On ours so hard we wrote your name on out
Mix after mix every record we make
To prepare or scare, so I dare you to take
Any part of the rhyme or the kickdrum sound
I be meetin you, defeatin you and beatin you down
My name rings bells and make rappers petrol
God help you, kid, when I get upset, yo
???????? bid your fans farewell
Cause the chance of you winnin is like snowin in hell
My rhymes are more than a tasket, a tisket
Too clever, yo, I never go out like a bisquit
Don't try to take my spot and not be legit
Try to vic my shoes and your feet won't fit
You're good, but compared to me you're not nearly
You think you can serve me? Come on, really
Till I can't breathe, yo, I'ma be with it
When I hear three words, you got it, I get it
My style is wild but strong and you're temporary
Violate the Juice Crew Laws and I bury
???? to the land a piece of tranquility
Suckers have the nack but they lack my ability
Those who tried to dis in the days behind us
Are back gonna dis us, brother, sign up
Make the mistake and I'm breakin your jaw
So don't ever dare violate Juice Crew Law

Never too alert, but I'm always cautious
And if you were on it you would save for some Porsches
Suckers get paid by means of distortion
My rhymes ??? your mind by means of a fortune
Rhymes clear and ????, time can't fly on
Mic, what you bring on stage you'll die on
Sit back and watch your life ???? and
If rhymes were juice I'd be Con Edison
???????????? accustomed
A sucker tried to snatch my chain and I bust him
I didn't cuff him and read him no rights
I knocked out his service and turned outs his lights
Be a ??????, don't let your boys divert you
Soup you up to battle me, kid, and I hurt you
Superior intellect made me a phenomenon
And I can go on and on and on and on
You can be blind but my rhymes still focus
And sucker tried to violete Law and I broke his
???????? tapes and his compact discs
And his boys stood around sayin (yo, he dissed you, kid)
Straight up, and I flip while a hype man 
Cuts you to pieces without puttin a knife in
You won't bleed, it feels the same
Now answer me right, boy, what's my name?
(Shan) These words respond any ???????
Guaranteed to decipher the mice from the men though
Now that I have the power make a refinement
Revealin the snakes is my next assignment
Make the mistake and I'm breakin your jaw
So don't ever dare violate Juice Crew Law

For those who betrayed me picture me ????
A few I know wish they woulda never come played me
So I'm ?????? you can't play ?????
Teach you how to rhyme, say ???????, dummy
The same period, the words don't fit
And got the nerve to get on stage and want to sing that -
Wait a minute, wait just a second
You know that's not my style - sorry, just checkin
But don't it make you sick when they be kickin la-di-da-di
But I got what it take to make you want to cold rock a party
Too hot to touch, too cold to hold ????? sadness
Junk you pop gets you dropped, stop the madness
My style is wild, my son, my child, selective
?????????? tough, ???? rough and effective
I tangle ya, mangle ya, strangle ya and then maw ya
This goes for you and you and you and all ya
Make the mistake and I'm breakin your jaw
So don't ever dare violate Juice Crew Law
