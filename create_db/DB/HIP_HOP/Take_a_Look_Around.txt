All the tension in the world today
All the little girls fillin up the world today
When the good comes to bad the bad comes to good
But I'm a live my life like I should

Now all the critics want to hit it
To Shit can how we did it
Just Because they don't get it
But I'll stay fitted
New era committed
Now this red cap gets a rap from his critics

Do we always gotta cry? (gotta cry)
Do we always gotta live inside a lie (a lie)
Life is just a blast
Its Movin really fast
You Better stay on top
Or life will kick you in the ass

Follow me into a solo
Remember that, kid
So what you want to do?
And where you gonna run

When your starin down the cable of a-
A mic pointed atcha grill like a gun
It's Limp Bizkit rockin the set
It's like Russian Roulette

When your placin your bet
So don't be upset
When your broke
And your done
'Cause i'm a be the one
'Til I jet

I know why you want to hate me
I know why you want to hate me
I know why you want to hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has ever seen lately

I know why you want to hate me
I know why you want to hate me
Now I know why you want to hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has ever seen lately

Why you want to hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
Now you want to hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately

Does anybody really know the secret
Or the combination for this life and where they keep it
Its kinda sad when you don't know the meaning
But everything happens for a reason
I don't even know what I should say
'cause I'm an idiot a loser a microphone abuser
I analyze every second I exist
Beaten on my mind every second with my fist

Everybody want to run (run)
Everybody want to hide from the gun (gun)
You can take a ride through this life if you want
But You can't take that edge off that knife (no sir)
And now you want your money back (money back)
But your denied 'cause your brains fried from the sac
And there ain't nothing I can do
'Cause life is a lesson you'll learn it when your through

I know why you want to hate me
I know why you want to hate me
I know why you want to hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has ever seen lately

I know why you want to hate me
I know why you want to hate me
Now I know why you want to hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has ever seen lately

Why you want to hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has ever seen lately
Now you want to hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has ever seen lately

(Now I know why..Now I know why..Now I know why)

Now I know why you want to hate me
Now I know why you want to hate me
Now I know why you want to hate me

'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
