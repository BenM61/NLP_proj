Evening is a time of day
I find nothing much to say
Don't know what to do
But I come to

When it's early in the morning
Over by the window day is dawning
When I feel the air I feel that
Life is very good to me you know
In the sun there's so much yellow
Something in the early morning meadow
Tells me that today you're on your way
And you'll be coming home, home to me

Nighttime isn't clear to me
I find nothing near to me
Don't know what to do
But I come to

When it's early in the morning
Very very early without warning
I can feel a newly formed vibration
Sneaking up on me again
There's a songbird on my pillow
I can see the funny weeping willow
I can see the sun you're on your way
And you'll be coming home
