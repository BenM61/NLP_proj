I know you gonna dig this
Oh one two one two three four
I know you gonna dig this everybody
Pump pump pum up that bass

I can see it in your eyes
You need a friend tonight
'Cause someone broke your heart in two
You need a volunteer
To wipe away your tears
Someone who will rescue you

Your whole world is tumbling down
Can't get your feet on solid ground
You're looking for someone
Someone you know, you can count on

I'll rise to the occasion
Help me through the situation
I'll be your inspiration
Yeah, I'll rise to the occasion, oh

No memories to shake
No promises to break
Just tender love and honestly
I can offer you so much
And I feel it when we touch
Maybe this was meant to be
I'm gonna share a secret with you
My heart's been broken too
I'm looking for someone
Someone I know I can count on

Take to heart this invitation
So won't you rise to the occasion
Help me through the situation
You can be my inspiration
Take to heart this invitation
Come on come on baby, ooh

Come on Buddy get with the beat
I don't know what you mean

Get with the beat - I'm a little rusty on it
Don't touch that
I know I know you gonna dig this
Pump pump pump up that bass
Dig this

Rise to the occasion
We'll get through this situation
Be each other's inspiration
I'll rise to the occasion
I'll give you real apprecation
I'll be your inspiration
