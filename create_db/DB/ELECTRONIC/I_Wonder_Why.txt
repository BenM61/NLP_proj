I know you're sleeping 
Away in your bed 
And I'm here I'm thinking 
What you said 

A long time away 
But always the same 
In my heart 
When, I saw your face 

I think of you 
Your warm embrace 
I see your face 
Don't know what I feel 

Just tell me that it's real 
I wonder why, I'm thinking of you 
I wonder when, you'll think me too 
I wonder why I see your eyes, 

I see your eyes 
I wonder why, I'm thinking of you 
I wonder when, you'll think me too 
I wonder why I see your eyes, 

I see your eyes
