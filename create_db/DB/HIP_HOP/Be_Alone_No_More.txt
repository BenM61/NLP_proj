Why do we argue the way we do
Can't you see girl that I, I'm in love with you
And it hurts (it hurts so bad)
To see you cry (to see you sad and blue)
When I'm needing you the most
But you feel (you feel someone)
When no one (will take the place of you)
And I don't wanne be alone

No I don't wanne be alone no more
Do you believe in love like I do
No I don't wanne be alone no more
Do you believe in love like I do

Don't hide the way you feel for me no more (no more)
Just because we're miles away doesn't mean I'm insecure
And it hurts (it hurts so bad)
To hear you cry (when I can't hold you)
And you're needing me the most
I feel (I feel the same)
Never chance (and I'll always love)

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Seeing shorty at the club
Lying around the block
Say I know a better place if you down me right
Too many clowns in this spot
No, I don't bump like that
Goes to where I have a beer and a shot of jazz
And after that we can head back to the crib
And I can show you just how bachelors live
But I'm sick of being alone,
Waiting for the phone,
For cutie to call with the bootie call
Rock-a-fella why'all

Don't run away from my love that you need
Don't turn away from my love you will see
You are the reason that I wanne live
And I want you to remain with me

No I don't wanne be alone no more
Do you believe in love like I do
No I don't wanne be alone no more
Do you believe in love like I do

No I don't wanne be alone no more
Do you believe in love like I do
No I don't wanne be alone no more
Do you believe in love like I do
