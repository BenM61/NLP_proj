She's standing on the corner
And she looks so alone
And she sacrifices her money
To a god she doesn't know

"Go repent" said the preacher
With his hands stuck in your pocket
Once you buy, you soon find out
There is no way
There is no way to stop him

Yeah she wants the mami krishna
And she's in the bathroom locked
The ceremony was pretty long
But the honeymoon was short

And "Go repent" said the preacher
With his hands stuck in your pocket
When you find the Lord, you soon find out
There is no way
There is no way to stop him

Now the high priest could've seen
But she got too hot to handle
He made her mother settle out of court
And incensed lit the candle

"Don't lose faith" said the preacher
With his hands stuck in your pocket
When you find the Lord, you soon find out
There is no way to stop him
"Don't lose faith" said the preacher
With his hands back in your pocket
Keep your hands out of my pocket
