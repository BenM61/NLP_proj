When I was 17 I did what people told me
Did what my father said,
And let my mother mold me
But that was a long ago
I'm in control, never gonna stop
Control, to get what I want
Control, I like to have a lot
Control, now I'm all grown up

First time I fell in love, I didn't know what hit me
So young and so naive, I thought it would be easy
Now I know I got to take
Control, now I've got a lot
Control, to get what I want
Control, never gonna stop
Control, now I'm all grown up

Jam, woo woo
Rebel, that's right
I'm on my own,
I'll call my own shots
Thank you

Got my own mind
I want to make my own decisions
When it has to do with my life, my life
I wanna be the one in control

So let me take you by the hand,
And lead you on this dance (Control)
Is what I've got, because I do with chance
I don't wanna rule the world,
Just wanna run my life (ooh
So make your life a little easier
When you get the chance just take control
Control, now I've got a lot, ooh
Control, to get what I want
Control, never gonna stop
Control, now I'm all grown up, ooh

Free at last
Out here on my own
Ooh ooh ooh yeah, hee
Now control this

Uh control, that's right
Control, career moves
Control, I do what's right for me
Control, and me wants to groove, is that ok?
Yeah, ooh, control

I've got my own mind
Ooh baby
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
I've got my own mind
Wanna make my own decisions
When it has to do with my life
I wanna be the one in control

Hop to it
