Oh my goodness! Look what they sendin through nowadays 
Ah  it's a light weight 
And he got a smirk on his face like it's all of that 
Yeah  well we gone see what it is 

What you in for  everything under the sun 
Recently  got me first degree wit a hot gun 
That's my third strike  so Xzibit can't go home 
Fight to see Daylight like Sylvester Stallone 
Don't ask too many questions nigga, keep that on the d-low 
My family might mistake you for an undercover see-O 
Last one that tried didn't make it past bookin 
Five times in the neck when everybody was lookin 

You see the judge, but he don't budge 
That's you're third felony, I believe strike three 
Remanded and stranded, to the cold steel granite 
Lost to the world, your moms and your girl 
Keep your weight up, or your ass get ate up 
Cats is stickin, straight up 
Wit the shank, get more time in the tank 
Ask Hank, he bout to bank, killed a cop wit high rank 
They gave him life and now another cat is fuckin his wife 

Just because I'm locked down don't mean the hustlin stop 
Her-oine and beer joints twenty dollars a pop 
You a new recruit, so today I'm lettin you slide 
But tomorrow you'll be confronted wit the two's in the side 
If you a smart mothafucker, you'll be fallin wit mine 
Behind bars, no bitches and cars, we only got time 
We're I'm from, time is money and got neither to waste 
Once in a while catch a Cannanite in the wrong place 
BEAT HIM DOWN, break the strongest hand, piss in his face 
Strike fear, play the rear, 'fore he catchin a case 
Low-class, got a dozen free visitors pass 
Plus the female see-Order want to give me some ass 

This is your new home boss, where you survive at all costs 
And if you don't, well it's only your loss 
You're only here 'cause you tried to force and be the boss, ha 
Handle your time like a man yo 

This is your new home boss, where you survive at all costs

Handle your time like a man yo 

So it's my twenty-third birthday, drinkin brew-no 
You know no matter what it take, we gotta celebrate 
F*ck stayin straight, hair braided by this Muslim cat 
Regulate the whole yard, now we got the straps 
Niggas say "Who the f*ck is that?" 
The X-Man, rowdy, gettin treated like the feds in the county 
Correctional facilities, basically you don't want to f*ck wit these 
Murders and felonies keep you company ("YEAH!") 

And yes y'all, come on in ("YEAH") 
All you brand new heffer, sissy, soft booty-ass shook niggas ("YEAH") 
Yeah bitch, welcom to central booking ("YEAH") 
A sleep-over for pimps, private hustlers ("YEAH"), drug slingers, and gun clappers 
Even bitch-ass, shook-ass niggas ("YEAH") like y'all 
Get on your ?("YEAH"), get out the blood on your ?married character? 
Kitten-ass faces ("YEAH"), niggas about to beat you all down to the last stop 

I'm all good, as I telephone my hood 
At first I was shook, tried to play by the book 
But you can't bid your time by stayin in the cell 
I'm gettin high everyday like I was still on the corner 
Where I'm in fat pink caps, New York to California 
Makin deals for mills, holdin cigarette lottos 
Givin cats pills, and tell em "Yo try those!" 
Niggas try to scheme but my team is tight 
We as shady as the night and bring fright to sight 
Hey you be aight, but don't act like a sucka 
Ain't you ain't got to be the wildest mothafucker 
Use control, put a cat in whole if he's broke 
And let em know, I just want to serve my time and go 
And flow, lay low, try to grab some dough 
Aiyyo I ain't tryin to jail, somebody post my bail 

This is your new home boss, where you survive at all costs 
And if you don't, well it's only your loss 
You're only here 'cause you tried to force and be the boss, ha 
Handle your time like a man yo

Yo man shhh, I need some new kicks man 
(Oh what? Oh shut the f*ck up!) 
Somebody got some at least some money man (Nigga what!) 
Or something man, I ain't get no letters man 
(You gone be my bitch tonight, what) 
Niggas forgettin about me man 
(I'll poke y'all, don't come on the island) 
Namsayin, supposed to be my crew 
(Don't be on the island when I get there) 
Can't even make collect phone calls 
(Mothafucker, what ah um!) 
Tryin to jam my collect calls now 
(You will be mines tonight mothafucker!) 
Nobody ain't home, nobody want to write me (Mine you hear me!) 
I ain't got nuttin to read, yaknamsayin 
(You'll be mine tonight mothafucker!) 
Ain't nobody put no money on my book 
(Don't fall asleep tonight bitch!) 
It's like I'm starvin in here 
This ain't no fun
