I don't care what you say
I don't know what you know
The look of love may come and go

The world is wide
I'm gonna take the things that life has to give
'Cause I know there's a place we can live
Somewhere deep in the night

We've got nothing to lose
We've got time on our side
Let's take a magic carpet ride

Come live with me
We'll be the people we once dreamed we could be
See the things we've been longing to see
Somewhere deep in the night

Somewhere deep in the night

I don't know if it's right
I don't care if it's wrong
Let's take this chance before it's gone

The world is wide
I'm gonna take the things that life has to give
'Cause I know there's a place we can live
Somewhere deep in the night

Let me take you there
Somewhere deep in the night
