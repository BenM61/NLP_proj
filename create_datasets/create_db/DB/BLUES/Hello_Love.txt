Hello love my old friend
Sure is good to see you again
I stood out, on the road
Just a watchin' the cars
A come and go
I felt empty, I felt bare
I really thought that I could not care
All the leaves are soaking wet
How succulent a little spring day gets

If you kiss me once
Out here in the rain
We'll go back and start all over again
So lift up every voice and sing
Sing to the tree tops
And everything
Say hello love
My old friend
Sure is nice
To see you again
