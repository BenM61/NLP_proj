If you just get it together and read my mind
Then sleeping will be easy.
And then I'll be there to acquiesce
I confess I'm in trouble

Another afternoon of increments,
And asking the wrong questions.
Then you get up and leave again,
Just as the evening, threatens to set.

Consider this now it's not too late,
I have watched you change
The colour of the trap before girl
I have learned to wait.

Most of the things that you say
I don't understand but I will sit and listen.
I nod along attentively,
But the truth is I can't concentrate.

Consider this now it's not too late
I have watched you change
The colour of the trap before girl
I have learned to wait.

Make no mistake
I have learned to wait
And you have learned that you can make me
I need something to sort me out
I need someone to come and shake me
And your exit calms me down
Before it infuriates me
Girl I'm in trouble
Wish you'd just get it together and read my mind
