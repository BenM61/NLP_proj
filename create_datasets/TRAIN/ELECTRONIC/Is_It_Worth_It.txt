Is it really working, working
We've tried and tried again
Is it even worth it, worth it?
To go through all this pain

Is it really working, working
We've tried and tried again
And you know the worst thing, the worst thing
I know you feel the same

I know you feel the same

I know you feel the same

Is it really working, working
We've tried and tried again
Is it even worth it, worth it?
To go through all this pain

Is it really working, working
We've tried and tried again
And you know the worst thing, the worst thing
I know you feel the same

I know you feel the same
