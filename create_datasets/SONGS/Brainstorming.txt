Brainstorming once you get your feelings hurt? So you
Wanna be loved by me? Love my name is MC B.

Brainstorming hoping that you would come back home or
Call me on the telephone cause I'm so alone. Walked
Around the house thinking of you, see me and you hand
In hand that's how it used to be. The happy days, the
Times we shared, without you baby is so damn weird.
Please forgive the things that I've done to you, I know
I did a few but baby I'm human too. I'll take you to
The beach where the wind blows and let the waves and
The sand run through your toes. Whatever you want,
Whatever you I'll plant the seed. But do you agree? I
Should deal with that you have another man but I can't
Understand you're still wearing my wedding band. I'll
Just chill and think about the whole thing in the
Morning. So I guess I'll keep:

I'll keep on brainstorming once you get your feelings
Hurt? So you wanna be loved by me? Love my name is MCB.

Now it's daylight, the sun's bright, my mind is clear.
I can't smell the breakfast that you used to cook my
Dear. Some cold water on my face so I can come to
Reality and realize it's me. My mind is not at ease
Since you've been gone. Please come back, cause I'm so
Alone.

P.S. Yeah, you know been looking for you for the
Longest, every since you left. But now I'm real
Independent you know, just laid back chillin'. I wanna
Let you know you're really thought about every night
And day. So I came up with these words and had Boyz II
Men sing 'em to you in the background you know what I'm
Saying. But I really want you back, so come back as
Soon as possible, cause I love you.

Brainstorming once you get your feelings hurt? So you
Wanna be loved by me? Love my name is MC B.

MCB.
