Freshly ground and fully prepared
Hot black coffee, boy (black coffee)

See I got hungover before I was ten
You see my skin is white but my soul is black
And a hot black coffee, that's where it's at

Black tea (ooh)

It's as good as it can be
But it's a cup of black coffee
That a working man needs to see, yeah

Here in america, where it's the land of the free
And you can get what you want if you've got some do re mi
And I've got me a job, and I'm working like a slave
Yeah I'm independent and you know I get paid
Say I got me a man, and I got me a little place
I got a spit of black coffee, and how good it tastes
I said a, a dime is all it costs in the States
For a cup of black coffee and how good it tastes
