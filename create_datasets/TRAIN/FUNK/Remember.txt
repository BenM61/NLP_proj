Long ago, far away
Life was clear, close your eyes

Remember, is a place from long ago
Remember, filled with everything you know
Remember, when you're sad and feelin' down
Remember, turn around

Remember, life is just a memory
Remember, close your eyes and you can see
Remember, think of all that life can be, remember

Dream, love is only in a dream, remember
Remember life is never as it seems, dream

Dream, love is only in a dream, remember
Remember life is never as it seems, dream

Ooh, long ago, far away
Life was clear, close your eyes
Remember, remember
