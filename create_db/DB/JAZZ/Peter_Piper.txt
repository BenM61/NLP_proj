I'm in the middle of solving a riddle that no one can do;
That goes for Albert Einstein, the League of Nations too,
So now my fine and feathered friend,
I'll leave it up to you.

If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers, 
How much do I love you?
Then what have I got to pick to turn the trick
And make you love me too?

If Simple Simon sat beside a shallow saucer
Tryin' to catch a whale
Then what have I got to try to make you buy
The heart I've got for sale?

How much wood would a wood-chuck chuck
If a wood-chuck could chuck wood?
I'd chuck double with no trouble
If it did me any good
If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers
I'll tell you what I'd do
I'd pick a peck of peppers
Sit beside a saucer
I'd even be a wood-chuck 
Chuck-in all I could chuck
Just to make you love me too.
