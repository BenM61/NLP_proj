My sweetheart
You got the best of me
For all eternity
My sweetheart
Now that I finally see Just what you mean to mean

Wherever you roam
You best believe that I will surely follow
Wherever you go, just know
That you are my soul, and

My sweetheart
You got the best of me
For eternity
My sweetheart
Now that I finally see
Just what you mean to mean

Darling this time
I promise to share with you all that is mine
Lover this time, I said I'm

With you for life, 'cause you're

Lately I know
That I've been just a little cold
But I quickly find out
That I can't live without my sugar, sweetheart

Wherever you roam
You best believe that I will surely follow
Wherever you go, just know
That you are my soul, and

My sweetheart
You got the best of me
For eternity
My sweetheart
Ain't no more make believe
You're my reality
My sweetheart
