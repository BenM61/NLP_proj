Thinking back on when
The dream was all I knew
Everything I've earned
Is all because of you

The love you gave us all
And the strength to carry on
You paved the only way
And I owe it all to you

I owe it all to you
All that I've achieved
All that I've received
Is all for you

And I never will
No I never will forget
Oh mama...
Your more than that to me
You're my friend
 
Holding back the tears
Though the struggle stayed for years
You gave me inner strength
And I owe it all to you

I owe it all to you
All that I've achieved
All that I've received
Well it's all for you

And I never will
No I never will forget
Oh mama...
Because you're more than that to me
You're my friend
