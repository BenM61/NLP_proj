Mama told me that some day it would happen
But she never said that it would happen like this
Papa said, "Look out, some girl'll catch you nappin'
Some little girl will get to you with her kiss"
You got to me
You brought me to may knees
Never thought I'd say please, girl
You got to my soul
You got control
You got to me, you got to be mine

Used to slip though every girl's hand like water
There never was one who could ever tie me down
Straight ahead and steady as Gibraltar
'Til you brought me tumblin' to the ground

You got to me
You brought me to may knees
Never thought I'd say please, girl
You got to my soul
You got control
You got to me, you got to be mine
