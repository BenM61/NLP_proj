There is something baby about you 
That's really attracting me, yeah
And your sweet love darling 
Really got a hold on me yeah

I've got a little taste of your love
And now I'm hooked on you, yeah
And I keep falling
Falling but what can I do?

I'm too weak to fight
Listen to me baby 
Too weak to fight, yeah

You're breaking down my health girl
I can't eat, I can't sleep 
No, I've tried to turn you loose now
But your hook is in too deep, yeah yeah
My resistance is getting a little low
And I've got to find a cure, yeah

But I keep falling, falling
Falling for you yeah
I'm too weak to fight 
Listen to me baby 
Too weak to fight, yeah 

I'm too weak to fight
You're messin' with my head
You got me too weak to fight 
Too weak to fight now baby 

You got me calling wrong numbers
Too weak to fight, yeah 
Too weak to fight now baby
