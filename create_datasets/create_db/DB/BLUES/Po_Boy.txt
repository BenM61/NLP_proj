Po' boy, long way from home
Woo,ooh, long way from home
I ain't got no woman
None to call my own

Wanna find me a woman
For tomorrow night
Woo, ooh, for tomorrow night
I'm gonna find me a woman
Brownie, someone to treat me right

I don't find me a woman
Gotta buy her hand
I don't find me a woman
Gotta buy her hand
She said, "Leave me daddy
'Cause I want you from my man"
