There's something 'bout the morning sun, a day's begun anew
Reminds me to appreciate the mystery of you
To see a bird soar in the sky I've often wondered why
We take so much for granted, we're too blind to see the view

Sometimes I lose my way
Just existing everyday
Drifting away from where my heart belongs
When my heart belongs to you

And it all begins with you
The secret of life is walking closer to the truth
Even the mountains bow to you
The stars are ornaments in the sky, they testify
That it all begins with you

The more of life I live to see, I feel more like a child
The lessons that I have to learn I know will take awhile
And if it takes eternity, I hope your plan's for me
Surround me with the gift of joy and make my days complete

Embrace me with your love
And help me rise above
Show me the way to keep the faith
So I won't forget to say

That it all begins with you
The secret of life is walking closer to the truth
Even the mountains bow to you
The stars are ornaments in the sky, they testify
That it all begins with you

Oh, there's love in wind my hope is alive
When I keep my eyes on you
Oh there's peace in my heart 'cause I've got a friend
Who'll forever be the strength to carry me through, carry me through

I know it all begins with you
The secret of life is walking closer to the truth
Even the mountains bow to you
The stars are ornaments in the sky, they testify
You're the reason why, and it all, all begins with you
