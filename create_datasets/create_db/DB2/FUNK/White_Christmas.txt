I'm dreaming of a white Christmas,
Just like the ones I used to know,
Where those treetops glisten, and children listen,
To hear sleigh bells in the snow, the snow

Then, I-I-I am dreaming of a white Christmas,
With every Christmas card I write,
May your days, may your days, may your days be merry and bright,
And may all your Christmases be white

I-I-I am dreaming of a white Christmas,
Just like the ones I used to know,
Where the treetops glisten, and children listen,
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I-I-I am dreaming of a white Christmas,
With every Christmas card I write,
May those days, may your days, may your days be merry and bright,
And may all your Christmases be white

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells all the way ooo
