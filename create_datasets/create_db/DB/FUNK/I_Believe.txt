I believe

I believe in the power and I never, ever doubt
Every minute, every hour I believe
I believe in myself 'cause I know I'll get my help
From the power in the sky I believe

No need askin' where I've been, just ask me where I'm goin'
'Cause I won't be ashamed to tell ya
I live my life knowin' all the roads ahead of me
Are filled with peace and love

Every step so heavenly, you'll fall and bounce right up
All miracles and dreams are realized for me through faith
Nothing seems impossible if you believe

I believe in the power and I never ever doubt
Every minute, every hour I believe
I believe in myself 'cause I know I'll get my help
From the power in the sky I believe

Lookin' in the mirror I can see my eyes are glowing
Living testimony that the spirit keeps me goin'
Oh, I'm feeling so good, got to raise my hands an rejoice
Say a few words to praise Him, every time I lift my voice

All miracles and dreams realized for me through faith
Nothin' seems impossible if you believe

I believe in the power and I never ever doubt
Every minute, every hour I believe
I believe in myself 'cause I know I'll get my help
From the power in the sky I believe
