Should I let you in
Into my house with its concrete walls
Should I let you in
Into my room with its curtains drawn 

I want to open up
And let you walk right through my door
Can you tell me
Is it worth
The risk anymore
Should I let you in? 

Should I let you in?
Should I let you in?
Should I let you in? 

Should I let you in
Into my far from perfect place
Should I let you see
Where I keep my secrets safe 

I want to open up
But I've been hurt this way before
Can you tell me
Is it worth the risk anymore?
Should I let you in? 

Through my window
I see you now
You're looking in
I'm looking out
My heart will make up its mind somehow 

Should I let you in into my house
Should I let you in inside these walls
Should I let you in into my heart
Should I let you in inside my world 

Should I let you in?
Should I let you in?
Should I let you in?
