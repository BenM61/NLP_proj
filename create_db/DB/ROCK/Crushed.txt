Its Limp Bizkit
And this is how we learn! 

You can't talk to me 
You're not supposed to be in ma face 
(So get the f*ck Outta ma face) 
My you insist 
You gotta talk that shit
You gotta keep that dog-ass breath 
All up in ma face 

But I rememba' when 
You would neva' lie to a friend 
'CXuse you were so high 
You were so shy 
You were so fucked up NE way 

[Chorus]
Life keeps on tickin'
Tickin' (tickin')
Into tha future
'Cause this is how we learn
Somebody better stop me 
Or at least stop this beat
Before we start gettin' outta hand
'Cause this is how we learn
And this is how we burn
And this is how we burn

You can't erase me
I'm alive as I can be	
In you're face
(So get the f*ck outta ma face)
My you insist
It's gotta turn out like this
You gonna burn out like this
All up in ma face

But I rememba' how
You said you want it all
And you want it now
'Cause you were so young
You were so dumb
You were so fucked up in yo' way

[Chorus]

Think about it
Think about it
Oh my
Where you at?
C'mon
I know ya feelin it baby
I know ya feelin it

C'mon freak baby
Freak, freak baby
Freak, freak baby

And this is how it should be done
And this is how it should be done
'Cause ma style is second to none

Outta here
I'm gettin' tha hell outta here
Limp Bizkit style
Yo' wait up
