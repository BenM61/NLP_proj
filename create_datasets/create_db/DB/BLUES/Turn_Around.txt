When you're all alone and blue
And the world looks down on you
Turn around, I'll be followin' you

When you feel that love is gone
And you realize you're wrong
Turn around, I'll be followin' you

Turn around, I'll be waitin' behind you
With a love that's real and never, ever dies
If you feel that love will last
And you'd like to live your past
Turn around, I'll be followin' you

Oh, turn around, I'll be followin' you
