Friday night, everything's right for the weekend
Crazy clothes, anything goes on a weekend
John called Ann and Jim got Sue
I made a date with little ol' you
Off we went to make a big tent on the weekend

Boy, it's great, just a-stayin' out late on a weekend
Know a spot and like it a lot on a weekend
Took a road to Lookout Hill
The view up there is sure a thrill
What a night to hold you tight on a weekend

There we were just sittin' cool and cozy
Just about to steal a little kiss
The police with a flashlight bright and nosy
Sayin', "holdin' neck o'er there, what is all this?"

Car top down, just ridin' around on a weekend
Took a chance on crashin' a dance on a weekend
We were almost inside the place
When somebody slammed the door in my face
"Hey, you guys have gotta wear ties on a weekend!"

No harm done, just a-havin' some fun on a weekend
That was all, we had a big ball on the weekend

(La-la-la, la-la-la-la)
(La-la-la, la-la-la-la)
