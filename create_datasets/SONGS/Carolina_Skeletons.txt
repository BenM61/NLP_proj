cowboy kate came too late,
she'll never see the dawn.
cowboy kate came too late,
she'll never face the sun.

the love goes by and the life runs dry,
pulls the tinsel from her hair.
she loses sight in the velvet night,
drops a tin can by the chair.


    through all the tiny victories and the big defeats,
    it's carolina skeletons that keep her rooted to her seat. 

cowboy kate came too late,
she'll never read the signs.
cowboy kate came too late,
she'll never have the time.

the love goes by and the life runs dry,
pulls the tinsel from her hair.
she dreams of flight in the velvet night,
throws a tin can in the air.



    through all the shitty obstacles and all the words so sweet,
    it's carolina skeletons that make her stranger when she eats.
