I got my eyes on the plaza
And I'm ready to cash it in
With you wanna be my 
I'm looking for a naughty plan
They don't mind me party 
And he's so hot, so 
no party game
And you can meet me in my bedroom, baby
As long as you know how to a girl crazy
And you'll be dono, I'll be daisy
can't be lazy! 
And when I feel that heat is on
We're freaking all night long
And when all strong inside

Boom boom boom boom
I want you in my room
Let's spend the night together
Boom boom boom boom
I want you in my room
Lets make this last forever
Just me and you together
Boom boom boom boom
Boom boom boom boom
Boom boom boom boom

Cause I get, I get, I get tingles when I see that boy
So hot he can be my toy
And we won't get we play all night to the early morning
All the little things just turn me on
 we will watch some porn
Or we can lay on a saying watch the sky 
Late hours, candle light, that's the way you like it, right
A little bit of shiver, a little bit of slice
That's the shit that pleasure cames
We ain't saint on and on
Make it last, and I wanna be your bonnie and clyde

Boom boom boom boom
I want you in my room
Let's spend the night together
Boom boom boom boom
I want you in my room
Lets make this last forever
Just me and you together
Boom boom boom boom
Boom boom boom boom
Boom boom boom boom

Come and squeeze me, come and kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
Come and squeeze me, come and kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
Come and squeeze me, come and kiss me, put your hand upon my cheek
Hold me tight, and don't let go, your loving got me turning weak
You blow my head, you're so sweet, taking all my energy
And I wanna boom boom boom
And I wanna boom boom boom
Like a video game ps 3
Come on, that's plug and play
Every girl who gives a f*ck what they say?
Give it to me baby like uh, uh
Everybody talking 
Boom boom boom, bitch, bla, bla, bla

Boom boom boom boom
I want you in my room
Let's spend the night together
Boom boom boom boom
I want you in my room
Lets make this last forever
Just me and you together
Boom boom boom boom
Boom boom boom boom
Boom boom boom boom
