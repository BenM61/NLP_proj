Pink girl with the blues, 
Pink girl, 
Pink girl with the blues,
Pink girl with the blues,
Pink girl.

If I let it turn to dust,
I could play it large and loud, 
I've got havoc in my veins, 
I'm just laying out my aim.

When I get to stir it up,
I forget I'm strong and proud,
And I go cruising down the lanes, 
I'm dying to be entertained, 
By a festival crowd, 
By a festival crowd.

When I get to stir it up, 
I forget I'm strong and proud,
And I go cruising down the lanes, 
I'm dying to be entertained, 
I'm dying to be entertained.

Curious yellow, curious yellow.

If I let it turn to dust, 
I could play it large and loud, 
I've got havoc in my veins, 
I'm just laying out my aim. 

When I get to stir it up, 
I forget I'm strong and proud 
And I go cruising down the lanes, 
I'm dying to be entertained by a festival crowd,
By a festival crowd.

If I'd never let you in,
If I'd never let you in.

If I let it turn to dust, 
I could play it large and loud, 
I've got havoc in my veins,
Pink girl with the blues.

Oh yeah,
Oh yeah,
Yeah, 
Yeah, 
Yeah,
Yeah.
Oh yeah,
Oh yeah, 
Yeah,
Yeah,
Yeah,
Yeah.
