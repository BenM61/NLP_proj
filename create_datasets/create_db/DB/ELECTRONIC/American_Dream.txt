"I don't like killing people...but sometimes it's necessary"
I saw my neighbors on the news today
They screamed about some snipers in our block
I turned it off, finished my six pack
And started to reload my M-16
This is my rifle, this is my gun
This is my life and this is for fun
I am the American dream
I am America
I keep my town clean and fresh
Free from enemies, no more mess
I pump the bastards so full of lead
That you hardly can turn them over
