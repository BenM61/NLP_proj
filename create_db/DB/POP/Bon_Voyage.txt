Imagining the rainbow
Trying to fit it in the sense of things
That might have been
Looking for the green flash
Hitting milliseconds just before the sun goes in

Bon Voyage
When you find the one
Don't let her go
Like you're letting me go

Bon Voyage
After all this time you'd think
We'd know
Why are you letting me go

A magic in the moonlight
In a bar beside the ocean
Where we used to meet
Caught up in our circumstance
We spin out wheels just
Waiting for the string to break

I see your face in windows on the Seine
I'm still sitting in a cafe where 
You said you'd wait
Like some romantic moment on the screen
You'd come running through that door
And then you're gone again

Bon Voyage
When you find the one
Don't let her go
Like you're letting me go

Bon Voyage
After all this time you'd think
We'd know
Why are you letting me go
