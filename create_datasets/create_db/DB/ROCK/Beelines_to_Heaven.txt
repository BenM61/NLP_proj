Here we go.
I just got given what I owe
And blown it on a stereo,
Can I have some more?
Crashed the car,
Drinking at the candy bars,
Makes you sick inside your heart
And no one ever knows.

When the honey don't come we're
Making beelines to heaven.

And angels are just all the same.
They wait until your in so much pain,
And then they call your name.
See I hate this show,
I just got into Rock & Roll
And I can't sleep at night.

When the honey don't come we're
Making beelines to heaven.
