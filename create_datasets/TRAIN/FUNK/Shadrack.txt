?Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
Now there were three children from the land of Israel
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
Ah they took a little trip to the land of Babylon
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
And ol Nebudchanezzer was the king of Babylon
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
So they took a lot of gold, and made em an idol
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
And they told everybody when you hear the music of the clarinet,
They told everybody when you hear the music of the flute,
Now listen, children, when you hear the music of the horn,
Oh, you gotta bow down and worship the idol!
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
Ah, but the children of Israel would not bow down!
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
We aint going to bow to no golden idol!
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
No, you couldnt fool the children with the golden idol!
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
So the king cast the children in the fiery furnace
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
He heaped on coal and red-hot brimstone you couldn't but see
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
Even made it seven times hotter than it oughtta be!
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
Now they burned up the soldiers that the king had put there
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
Oh, Shadrack! Meshach, Abednego!
Um hmm, then the Good Lord called an angel,
Gave him a couple of wings.
He said go down there through the middle of the furnace
And began to coolin' the flames.
And those children got so happy, 
they went struttin right through the fire.
And this lot got to talkin' bout the power of gospel
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
Oh, Shadrack! Meshach, Abednego!!!
