1, 2, 3, 4, yeah
Polow the Don, listen girl
Mario, let's go, ladies

It?s like you caught up in a maze
You keep on going in circles, girl
You're trying to find your way out
But it's time I put on my cape and
Put that S on my chest
Girl I wanna come and save you

But I'm stuck in the middle of seeing you hurt
I know when you love him and you wanna make it work
And I can't help but think that I known you first
It?s getting louder, girl, can't ignore it no more

I can hear your heart crying out for me
(Crying out for me)
I can hear your heart crying out for me
(And it keeps on saying)

Come on in, come on in, come on in and save me
(And it keeps on saying)
Come on in, come on in, come on in and save me
(I can baby)
I can hear your heart crying out for me

Baby, I should've never caught no feeling
But baby having late night conversions on your sofa
You telling me how he played you out
Over and over, over and over

But I'm stuck in the middle of seeing you hurt
I know when you love him and you wanna make it work
And I can't help but think that I knew you first
It?s getting louder, girl, I can't ignore it no more baby

I can hear your heart crying out for me
(Crying out for me)
I can hear your heart crying out for me
(Oh, yeah and girl, it?s saying)

Come on in, come on in, come on in and save me

Come on in, come on in, come on in and save me
I can hear your heart crying out for me
(I can hear it, yeah)
Girl, it?s crying, it?s crying

I don't wanna confuse things
(No)
But I just can't keep lying to myself
When you're holding me
(When you're holding me)

I can feel your pain
Oh baby, let me be your dream
I'm the answer come see me
(See me)
And you don't have to cry no more

Girl, I can hear your heart

For me, for me, for me, me

Said ladies wave your hands in the air
Ladies wave your hands in the air

Oh baby, it?s crying for me
