Five a.m. Friday morning Thursday night far from sleep
I'm still up and driving can't go home obviously
So I'll just change direction 'cause they'll soon know where I live
And I want to live
Got a full tank and some chips

It was me
And a gun
And a man
On my back
And I sang Holly Holy as he buttoned down his pants

You can laugh
It's kind of funny
Things you think
Times like these
Like I haven't seen Barbados so I must get out of this
Yes I wore a slinky red thing
Does that mean I should spread for you, your friends
Your father, Mr. Ed

It was me
And a gun
And a man
On my back
But I haven't seen Barbados so I must get out of this

And I know what this means
Me and Jesus a few years back used to hang
And he said it's your choice babe just remember
I don't think you'll be back in three days time so you choose well
Tell me what's right
Is it my right to be on my stomach of Fred's Seville

It was me
And a gun
And a man
On my back
But I haven't seen Barbados so I must get out of this

And do you know Carolina
Where the biscuits are soft and sweet
These things go through your head when there's a man on your back
And you're pushed flat on your stomach it's not a classic Cadillac

It was me
And a gun
And a man
On my back
But I haven't seen Barbados so I must get out of this
I haven't seen Barbados so I must get out of this
