You're like a child with old eyes,
Cynical and sensible, always full of surprises
You travel far and wide
Looking for the feeling, lost inside you
They don't understand you, no
Until it's too late
With everything they've handed you
On a silver plate

Are you hungry for a little more
Than what you've had before?
Are you hungry for a taste of life?
Whet your appetite, are you hungry?

Now give me this mountainside
Cool waters to lie beside
Give me these two strong eyes
To see the difference between truth and lies
Ah, give me this feeling when you kiss me baby

Every day and every night
That's all I need, yes
Everything is gonna be all right

Are you hungry for a little more
Than what you've had before?
Are you hungry for a taste of life?
Whet your appetite, are you hungry?

You're like a sight for sore eyes, lyrical and gentle
Border-lining sentimental
You're like a dream realized
So why do I keep falling back to sleep,
I'm so serious and deep.

Are you hungry for a little more
Than what you've had before?
Are you hungry for a taste of life?
Whet your appetite, are you hungry?

Are you hungry for a little more
Than what you've had before?
Are you hungry for a taste of life?
Whet your appetite, are you hungry?
