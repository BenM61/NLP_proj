Love you like no other
Love you rain or shine
You could be the one thing
That is on my mind
This could be our last chance
Don't get left behind
Phone you at the weekend if I get time

She's a disconnected child
Disconnected child
Disconnected child
Disconnected child
She's been on my mind

She's been leaving lovers
Don't get left behind
She'll feel bad tomorrow
That's another time

Let's do this together
I'm sure that it's fine
We'll feel bad tomorrow
That's another time

She's a disconnected child
Disconnected child
Disconnected child
Disconnected child
And I'm feeling

Like you're doing
Ahh, like you're do to me
Ahh, like you're doing
Ahh, like you're do to me
Ahh, like you're doing
Ahh, like you're doing
Ahh, like you're doing to me

And I'm feeling low now
Yeah, I've no place to go
And I'm feeling low now
And I've no place to go

Disconnected child
Disconnected child

She's a disconnected child
Disconnected child
Disconnected child
Disconnected child

And I'm feeling
And I'm feeling
And I'm feeling
Ahh, like you're doing
Ahh, like you're do to me
Ahh, like you're doing

Ahh, like you're do to me
Ahh, like you're doing
Ahh, like you're do to me

Ahh, like you're doing
Ahh, like you're doing
Ahh, like you're doing
Ahh, like you're doing

Ahh, like you're doing
Ahh, like you're doing
Ahh, like you're doing
Ahh, like you're doing

Like you're doing to me
