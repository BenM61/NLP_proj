[Chorus:]
Good things don't last forever, baby
Something 'bout you, girl, that drives me crazy
Ain't no ifs and buts or maybes
You'll always be my friend
You will always be
You will always be
Say you'll always be
My friend

She want to know what the reason I'm saying she can be my friend
But, baby, I'm a player, ain't no reason to pretend
By

[Chorus]

You're the only girl I wanna see daily
Not a lot save me but you could be my lady
Let's take it to another level you remember
The first day I got what you want and
It wasn't even your birthday, nah, now
We kick it too hard, you went too deep
Say you feel it in your heart, so
I'm a be real 'cause you give me what I want
And I ain't gonna tell you I love you if I don't
I understand you got a man
But he can't even understand how you feel
But if you stop coming around
And I don't see you again I guess we can
Just be, woo

[Chorus]

Now, ladies, you all know what I'm talking about
See, I don't want a man that will be dipping
In and out of my life, I want friend that be
There thick and thin, you know what I'm saying?
Someone to take it back to the eye's level
I want somebody to always run back to me
And trust I'll always be here with that cool thang

If I couldn't walk again, would you
Still be there for me if I lost it all today?
Would ya care for me? Yeah, would you write me?
In the bed kinda of friend that will be there
Without the Benz
You never ask about the money that you
Lent me, nah, you look good with your
Body; you're the type of girl that money
Can't buy me

[Chorus]
