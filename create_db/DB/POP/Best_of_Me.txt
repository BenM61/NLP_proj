You've got the best of me
More than I can give
In every part of me
Just for you I live

We shared our lives together
For so many years
Been through stormy weather
Shared our joys and tears

But oh this change of feeling
Has got me so confused
Feeling so rejected
Feeling like I'm used

What more can I say
What more can I do
Seems I'm wasting my time
Trying to show you

You've got the best of me
More than I can give
In every part of me
Just for you I live

You've got the best of me
More than I can give
In every part of me
Just for you I live

Seems I've been to hell and back
Only just to please you
And you're still believing
That I don't give a damn

Yes I've made my mistakes
With no intent to hurt you
Tried so very hard
Just to make you understand

What more can I say
What more can I do
Seems I'm wasting my time
Trying to show you

You've got the best of me
More than I can give
In every part of me
Just for you I live

You've got the best of me
More than I can give
In every part of me
Just for you I live

Whoa oh hey
Oh yeah
Very best of me baby, ooh
Can't you see, yeah

What more can I do
What more can I say
Seems I'm wasting my time
Trying to show you

You've got the best of me
More than I can give
In every part of me
Just for you I live

You've got the best of me
More than I can give
In every part of me
Just for you I live

You've got the best of me
More than I can give
In every part of me
Just for you I live
