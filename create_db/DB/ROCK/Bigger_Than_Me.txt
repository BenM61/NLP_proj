There is a darkness to these jaded days
Maybe it's a seasonal affected disorder
Or maybe we're just s.a.d.
There is photosynthesis
We crane our necks for sunlight
There's a different sun for everyone

And it's bigger than me, this sun is bigger
Yeah it's bigger than me, this sun is bigger
So much more to eat, this sun is bigger
To be bigger than me, this sun is bigger

There is a vacuum
There are boys with toys
These toys of coldness
And a smart arse
There is a cuckoo
Who's been and lain in my nest
And the egg is hatching
And Christ I'll never be able to feed it

'Cos it's bigger than me, this chick is bigger
Yeah it's bigger than me, this chick is bigger
So much more to eat, this chick is bigger
To be bigger than me, this chick is bigger
Oh yeah!

I should welcome all
Both fallow and fertile
I should welcome all
Both circumcised and gentile
But I can be so, so elsewhere
And I can be so, so cold

There is a world
So full of people
Full of love and shrapnel
Full of bag ladies and bag ladies and
Wicker men

And it's bigger than me, this world is bigger
Yea it's bigger than me, this world is bigger
Still so much more to eat, this world is bigger
To be bigger than me, this world is bigger

Am I a stone?
Am I a sponge?
