What if I don't need debating
If I'm not healed by negotiating
If I don't need to be a shooting star
If I don't need a fast car

If nothing changes when I whine and moan
If no one cares if I pay my loan
What if I shake hands with doom
Or thrash another hotel room

What if the sky is always moonlit
When it all comes down to it
And no trillion zillion dollars
Can break those chains and collars

What if love's just methadone
If the battle's already won
If I'm clean or in a purple haze
If my sleeves don't hide an ace

Don't be afraid
What if there's no Cayman sunshine
To make me believe I'm fine
What if I'm stuck in immigration
And the train just left the station

What if you think I think I'm Davy Crockett
If I'm caught with bullets in my pocket
What if I read in a crystal ball
That I better put an end to it all

Don't be afraid
