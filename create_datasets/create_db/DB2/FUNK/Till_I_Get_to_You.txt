My lover A was absolutely alright
But my lover be would bump my tunes in his ride
Then my lover see caught me in the cookie jar
'Cause my lover D was too delicious to deny

My lover E was extraordinary and my one regret
'Cause my lover F was just too freaky to forget
My lover G was touch and go for a good while
But my lover H was proof that I haven't found you yet

It's just a matter of time till I get to you
No matter how many I gotta get through
It's just a matter of time till I get to you
Just a matter of time till I get to you

And I gotta say I was jonesin for my lover J
But my jelly was too sweet for him and jealousy got in the way
Let's just say my lover K was kicked to the curb
And my lovers L M N O P have all become a blurb

My lover Q was quite qualified
But my lover are was ready to rush me out of his life
My lover S was so busy spreadin' his seed
That I took to tearin' it up with my lover T

It's just a matter of time till I get to you
No matter how many I gotta get through
It's just a matter of time till I get to you
Just a matter of time till I get to you

You make me feel like singin'
Lalalalala
You make me feel like singin'
Lalalalalala
You make me feel like singin'
Lalalala
I don't need no reason
Now that I got you in my life

c'mon, it's just a matter of time
It's just a matter of time yeah
It's just a matter of time yeah yeah
It's just a matter of time yeah yeah
It's just a matter of time yeah yeah
It's just a matter of time yeah yeah
C'mon now, till I got to you
