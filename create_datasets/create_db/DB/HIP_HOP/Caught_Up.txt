I'm the kinda brotha
Who been doin it my way 
Gettin my bread for years
In my career
And every lover
In and out my life 
I hid love and left her tear
Without a care
Until I met this girl who turned the tables around
She caught me by surprise
I never thought I'd be the one breaking down
I cant figure it out why I'm so

Caught up
Got me feelin it 
Caught up
I dont know what it is
(But she's got me twisted) 
But it seems she got me twisted
I'm so
Caught Up
Got me feelin it
Caught up
I'm loosin control
This girls got a hold on me

Oh no
Let me go baby
Now listen
My momma told me 
Be careful who you do cuz karma comes back around
Same ol song
But I was so sure
It wouldn't happen to me 
Cuz I know how to put it down 
But I was so wrong
This girl was mean she really turned me out
My homies say this girl is crampin my style
And I cant figure it out but I'm so

Caught up
Got me feelin it 
Caught up
I dont know what it is 
But it seems she got me twisted
I'm so
Caught up
