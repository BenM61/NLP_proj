Just two bodies
Just two bodies
Been so ready to dim my mind

Come over or not, I've
Been so ready to dim my mind
Your body a drug, for mine
Two bodies moving in
Time and space to try and heal me
I know what I want, so come over and

Hold me, I won't ask for anything more
I'm hurting, use me now when I'm vulnerable
It helps me fake some love for a little while
I know what I want, so take advantage of me

I don't mind if you take advantage of me
So take advantage of me

You're closed, you're a book. No lines
Can't read you if I try
And if that's the way you want it
That's fine I'll just close my eyes and
Try to ignore you, a free ride for you to

Hold me, I won't ask for anything more
I'm hurting, use me now when I'm vulnerable
It helps me fake some love for a little while
I know what I want, so take advantage of me

I don't mind if you take advantage of me
So take advantage of me

Just two bodies
Just two bodies

Just two bodies

Hold me, I won't ask for anything more
I'm hurting, use me now when I'm vulnerable
It helps me fake some love for a little while
I know what I want, so take advantage of me

I don't mind if you take advantage of me
So take advantage of me

Hold me, I won't ask for anything more
I'm hurting, use me now when I'm vulnerable
It helps me fake some love for a little while
I know what I want, so take advantage of me

Hold me, I won't ask for anything more
I'm hurting, use me now when I'm vulnerable
It helps me fake some love for a little while
I know what I want, so take advantage of me

I don't mind if you take advantage of me
So take advantage of me
