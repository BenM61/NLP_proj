(john fiddler)

Made my way across the city now
Me and my suitcase was in my car
All the lights they were laughin' at me
In the spotlight you can see the scar

Our love is on the road to ruins
Falling deeper and deeper
My heart spins a wheel

You've become the ghost of futures past now
You're the nightmare that's in my dreams
You get up to take another blast now
You're the flies in my potions and creams

Our love is on the road to ruins
Falling deeper and deeper
My heart spins a wheel
Give me one more chance to run
Give me one more chance to run
Give me one more chance to run

I wish that I was free as a bird now
Flying so high that I could not come down
I would sing every song you ever heard now
Hit every spot in this one-horse town

Our love is on the road to ruins
Falling deeper and deeper
My heart spins a wheel
Give me one more chance to run
Give me one more chance to run
Give me one more chance to run

Give me one more chance to run (I'm begging you please)
Give me one more chance to run (I'm down on my knees)
Give me one more chance to run

I've rolled and I've rolled round this tumbling old world
I hold on fast to give my love to the girl

Give me one more chance to run...
