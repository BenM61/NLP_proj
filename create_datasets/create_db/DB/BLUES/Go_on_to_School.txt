I met a little girl, was on her way to school
I met a little girl, she ain't nobody's fool
Well go on baby, don't be nobody's fool

They got ya readin' an' writin', workin' 'rithmetic
I know those teacher's 'bout ta, make ya sick
But go on baby, don't be nobody's fool
I'll see ya in the mornin' on your way to school

Well you know they got ya standin' at the, head of your class
And the kids don't like it, tryin'-a make ya feel bad
Go on baby, don't be nobody's fool
I'll see ya in the mornin', on your ways to school
