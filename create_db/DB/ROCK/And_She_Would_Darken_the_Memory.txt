And head up, dear, you're shallow and blind
And head up, dear, the rabbit might die
Because I'm putting the boot in, tonight

And head up, dear, you're shallow and blind
And head up, dear, the rabbit might die
And you say hi, and you say hi
Because I'm putting up with your constant whine

And that won't last too long
And friendly faces with put on smiles
A drunken mind game past
Because I'm putting the boot in tonight

And head up, dear, you're shallow and blind
And head up, dear, the rabbit might die
And you say hi, and you say hi
Because I'm putting up with your constant whine

And that won't last too long
And friendly faces with put on smiles
A drunken mind game past
Because I'm putting the boot in tonight
