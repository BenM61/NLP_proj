Now the wings fell to ground as the miles they were crossed
All the years seemed like days as the time it was lost
For without his solutions and reasons for why
He should come up for air to the town once his by

So soon on his way
Shadows from the pathways
Memories of old days

That the journey was long many thoughts filled his mind
As he neared the stop always a dream he would find
But the road that he knew could no longer be seen
And the city lights flickered where lake waters gleamed

With sadness today
Hopes of joy yesterday
Memories of old days

Sky and the trees of his youthful time spent
Only smoke, only paper.  No colour or scent

With sadness today
Hopes of joy yesterday
Memories of old days
