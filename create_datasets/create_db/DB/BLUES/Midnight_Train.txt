I was standin' at the station,
ten to midnight in the rain
I was mindin' my own bus'ness,
waiting for that midnight train

Nobody in sight, starin' at my shoes,
I took out my paper to find me some good news
Mindin' my own bus'ness,
when the ticket man calls my name
Yeah, yeah, babe

There ain't no midnight train
There ain't no midnight train
There ain't no midnight train
Comin' down the line

So I say, "If it ain't too much trouble,
when's the local out of town?"
His reply: "Two a.m."
If I'm leavin' local-bound

I can catch it in forty minutes,
if I want to grab the express
But the local trains are hard to come by,
this time of night, more or less
Listen, said

There ain't no midnight train
There ain't no midnight train
There ain't no midnight train
Comin' down the line

So I stood for forty minutes,
it was raining and it was cold
When the express rolled down the track,
I did not care where it was gonna go
Yeah, yeah

He said
There ain't no midnight train
There ain't no midnight train
There ain't no midnight train
Comin' down the line
