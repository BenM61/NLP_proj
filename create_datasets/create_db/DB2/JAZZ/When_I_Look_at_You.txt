I was just a lonely Melisande, Pity pity me.
Came a little wizard, waved his wand,
Dreamed you up for me.

Now I feel a tingle each time I glimpse your face go dreaming by;
Proving the heart is quicker than the eye.

When I Look At You, I hear lovely music
Can it be my heart that sings?
When I Look At You I look at an angel
Tell me where you've parked your wings.
Dizzy me, Silly moon, crazy quilt of a sky
Are you real, or a dream 
That got caught in my eye?

When I Look At You I'm looking at rainbows
Stars come tumbling down from above
And I'm in love with you, my love !
