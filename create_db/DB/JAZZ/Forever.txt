I may burn out like a candle and
I may pass away
I may fall just like a shooting star
my heart will stay
I'll be yours until forever,
forever I'll be true to the promise
I have made from the day that
I found you
forever your in my heart
even if were apart

[Chorus]
I say, forever I'll be yours
forever I love you
I say, forever I'll be yours
forever I love you
my love will never fade away
even if I'll die and
I will love you until the end of time
even without your smile

So help me please I beg you
don't walk away I need you
just stay with me and be by my side
take my hand and will work it out

[Chorus]

So help me please I beg you
to stay
