Divide your cultured pearls in haste
I'm looking for to lay to waste
Of all the things I cannot taste
And this is not the racy race, they spoke loud

(I believe in what you do)
(I believe in watching you)
(I believe in what you do) it's what you do
(I believe in watching you)

I could turn you inside-out
What I choose not to do
I could turn you inside-out
What I choose not to do

Given the choice
Given the heart
Given the tool
Given the word
Given the cheers

(I believe in what you do)
(I believe in watching you)
(I believe in what you do) it's what you do
(I believe in watching you)

(I believe in what you do)
(I believe in watching you) I, I, I, I, I

I could turn you inside-out
What I choose not to do
I could turn you inside-out
What I choose not to do

I believe in what you do
I believe in watching you
I believe in what you do (given the choice)
I believe in watching you (given the heart)
I believe in what you do (given the tool)
I believe in watching you (given the word)
I believe in what you do (given the cheers)
I believe in watching you

I could, I

I could turn you inside-out
What I choose not to do
I could turn you inside-out
What I choose not to do

Given the choice
Given the heart
Given the tool
Given the word
Given the cheers
Given the cheers
Given the choice
Given the choice
Given the choice
