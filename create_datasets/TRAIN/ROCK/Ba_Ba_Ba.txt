Ba-ba-ba ba-ba, ba-ba-ba ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba ba-ba, ba-ba-ba ba-ba
Aie-aie-aie

This is the song
Hell of a song
Twelve inches long
It's easy, it's easy, it's easy for some, oh

This is the way
To be queen for a day
So play away
If you don't care what they say

You work so hard, they just expect you to
Work so hard, they've got it in for you
Work so hard, nothing is getting through
They just got sick of you

Ba-ba-ba ba-ba, ba-ba-ba ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba ba-ba, ba-ba-ba ba-ba
Aie-aie-aie

This is the sound
Of the hare and the hound
With its feet on the ground
Are you in for a penny or in for a pound?

You work so hard, they just expect you to
You work so hard, they've got it in for you
You work so hard, nothing is getting through
They just got sick of you

Ba-ba-ba ba-ba, ba-ba-ba ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba ba-ba, ba-ba-ba ba-ba
