It's all good. My lovin's all good.

Felecia:
Lately, you've been stressin' me about when I'm a give you some, callin' me,
Jockin' me, sweatin' me, gonna rush me none, 'cause when the time is right I'm
Gonna let you know, and that's for sure. So wait on me patiently and see what
I got in store, 'cause I'm gonna represent to the fullest. I'll be there and I
Promise you no regrets. Just put your trust in me, and baby, I promise this
Shit is legit (legit, legit, legit . .

Felecia:
It's all good. My lovin' is, my lovin' is, all good, all good, all good.
You know it's all good, all good, all good.
Krayzie:
Yep, yep, yep. It's all G-double O-D, good, good, good.
Yep, yep, yep. It's all G-double O-D, good with me, with me, with me.

Felecia:
If I told you once, then I told you twice. You gotta get to know me. There's
More to a relationship then jumpin' in the sheets, and if that's all you want,
Then you better go, 'cause that ain't me. I don't give my love to just
Anybody. If I'm not correct, then prove me wrong, and just hold on.
Gradually, you will see, just how good it'll be. When the time is right, I'll
Ease your mind with a little bump and grind. Fantasies full of ecstasy: we'll
Have a real good time.

Felecia:
It's all good. My lovin' is, my lovin' is, all good, all good, all good.
You know it's all good, all good, all good.

Krayzie:
Yep, yep, yep. It's all G-double O-D, good, good, good.
Yep, yep, yep. It's all G-double O-D, good with me, with me, with me.

Krayzie:

Bone. Come and jump in the Benz and tell your friends you will get with them
Later. Come and let me take ya. Got a couple things I wanna show ya. I'm
Really tryin' to know ya. I'm just curious: is it really all good? You
Serious? I'm serious. If it is, then I gotta jump on it, ride it--ghetto
Cowboy. Surprise, you thought I was quiet. I never was shy, baby. Niggas
Just act like that. Lay back, but don't let that fool ya, rule ya. Really
Give that the nigga the bag, 'cause we won't have time to talk. I've been
Peepin' for a minute now (Yep, yep, yep . . .), and I know just where I'm a
Start. Let me listen to your heartbeat. Boomp, boomp, racin' intense
Situation. Is it gettin' kind of hot in here? Naw, that's you. Temperature's
Risin', so am I.
