Slow, slow dancer, oh, no answers, for you, new moves to see
Oh, fast talkers in dark corners, for you, new words to hear
Oh, sly glances, oh, half chances, for you, the eye that sees
When the sun slips from the day and the coolness brings relief
There's no torment 'neath the stars in the stillness of the night
When the swirling has to cease behind the safety of the veil
Oh yeah

Now in high places, darkened faces, so indifferent in days to be
Oh, lost race, no losers, only winners return to see
New order can't be altered when the eyes refuse to see
When the sun slips from the day and the coolness brings relief
There's no torment 'neath the stars in the stillness of the night

(Ah-ah ah-ah)
When the swirling has to cease behind the safety of the veil
(Ah-ah)
Ah-ah ah ah-ah
Ah-ah ah ah-ah
Now, now, now!

Soft, soft spoken, never could be broken, awaiting the call that frees
Slow burning, turn with yearning, complacence burns down on me
Hearts leaping, hopes been reaching to the heights, to the heights

The signs to see
Oh baby
I should say now, baby, baby, baby
Oh baby, baby, baby
In the darkness
Oh Lord, so good
Oh Lord, so fine

In the darkness, in the darkness, yes, yes, yes, yes
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Don't you want to go?
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
No, no, no, no, no, don't you want to go?
Don't you want to go?
Ah-ah, ah-ah, feels good, oh yes
Please, please, please
So good, so good, so good, my baby
