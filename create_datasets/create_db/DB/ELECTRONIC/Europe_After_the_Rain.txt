It's time to walk again
It's time to make our way
Through the fountain squares
And the collonades

Your dress is shimmering
Your voice is hiding things
When you say
I've hardly changed

In Europe
After the rain
When the nights are warm
And the summer sways...

The stained glass echoing
The blossom balconies
And voices blow
On a shining wind 
 
Your face is shimmering
Your smile is glimmering
When I say
You've hardly changed

In Europe
After the rain
When the nights are warm
And the summer sways...

In Europe after the rain
In Europe after the rain
In Europe after the rain
In Europe after the rain
