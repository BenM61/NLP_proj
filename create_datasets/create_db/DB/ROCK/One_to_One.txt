If I am the question,
You are the answer
If you are the music, 
I am the dancer
Through all of the madness
And all of the sadness
Of day-to-day living
We gotta keep giving

One to one
Me to you
Pure and simple,
Sweet and true
One to one, you to me
Sending the love so it's
Spreading out endlessly

Now there are those moments
When life loses meaning
And we lose our faith in
The dreams we've been dreaming
When people seem mindless
And plain human kindness
Appears to be dying
We gotta keep trying

One to one
Me to you
Pure and simple,
Sweet and true
One to one, you to me
Sending the love so it's
Spreading out endlessly

I know this world needs changin'
I know the shape we're in
But with all the confusion
I've reached the conclusion
There's only one place to begin 
And that's

One to one
Me to you
Pure and simple,
Sweet and true
One to one, you to me
Sending the love so it's
Spreading out endlessly
