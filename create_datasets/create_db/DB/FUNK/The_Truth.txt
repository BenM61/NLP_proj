Like a hurricane without warning
I woke up Sunday Morning
Had to face the truth
The truth about me and you
Ah baby ooh

We don't even kiss
Can't live my life like this
Time to face the truth baby
I don't love you like I used to ooh

You know that we grew apart
Scared to leave
Just don't want to be lonely
Instead we wasted to much time
Living lies
It's time we face the truth baby
The truth about me and you
Ahh baby ooh
