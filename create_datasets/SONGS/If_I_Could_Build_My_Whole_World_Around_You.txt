Oh, if I could build my whole world around you, darling
First I'd put heaven by your side
Pretty flowers would grow wherever you walk, honey
And over your head would be the bluest sky
Then I'd take every drop of rain
And wash all your troubles away
I'd have the whole world wrapped up in you, darling
And that would be alright, oh yes it will

If I could build my whole world around you
I'd make your eyes the morning sun
I'd put so much love where there is sorrow
I'd put joy where there's never been none
Then I'd give my love to you
For you to keep for the rest of your life
Oh, and happiness would surely be ours
And that would be alright, oh, yes it would

Do-do-do-doo-doo
Do-do-do-doo-doo
Do-do-do-doo-doo
Do-do-do-doo-doo

Oh, If I could build my whole world around you
I'd give you the greatest gift any woman could possess

And I'd step into this world you created
And give you a true love and tenderness
And there'd be something new with every tomorrow
To make this world better as days go by

That is, if I could build my whole world around you
If I could build my whole world around you
That would be all right, oh yeah

If I could build my whole world around you
If I could build my whole world around you
Then that would be all right, oh yeah

If I could just build my world, baby
If I could build it, build it, all around you
