Long before a boat anchored the harbour
Long before steel drums filled the breeze
God lifted these islands from the ocean
They stood strong for centuries

So it's fitting they were named after men with golden halos
'Cause angels don't give in just cause a little wind blows

We say we can when they say we can't
See what it is when they see what it ain't
With blood, sweat, and tears and a new coat of paint
We're just a sinner's choir singin' a song for the saints
Woah, woah
Woah, woah

For the farmer in the field of sugar cane
For the drunkard in his hammock, dryin' out after the rain
For the teacher in the classroom, kid kickin' cans in the street
For the captain and his bar mate, prayin' down on bended knees

We say we can when they say we can't
See what it is when they see what it ain't
With blood, sweat, and tears and a new coat of paint
We're just a sinner's choir singin' a song for the saints
Woah, woah
Woah, woah

This brokenness will heal, this weakness will be strong
Let's lift our voice together as the saints go marchin' on

We say we can when they say we can't
See what it is when they see what it ain't
With blood, sweat, and tears and a new coat of paint
We're just a sinner's choir singin' a song for the

We say we can when they say we can't
See what it is when they see what it ain't
With blood, sweat, and tears and a new coat of paint
We're just a sinner's choir singin' a song for the saints
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
