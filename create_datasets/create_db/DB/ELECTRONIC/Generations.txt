You've got 27 years on me, the things you're doing make me smile
The days we spend are sent from heaven, and you're always on my mind
And you're always on my mind

In my heart, there's a rainbow glowing (in my heart)
In my head, there's a moon so bright (in my head)
In my sky, there's a snow cloud snowing (in my sky)

Sandman's coming out tonight
I've got 27 years on you, the things you're doing make me laugh loud
The days we spend are sent from heaven, and you've given me my life
In my heart, there's a rainbow glowing (in my heart)
In my head, there's a moon so bright (in my head)
In my sky, there's a snow cloud snowing (in my sky)
Sandman's coming out tonight

Ba ba ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba ba ba

Planet spins, planet spins, and another generation gives the hope
And the joy and the life to the beat to the heart of the next
Free at last, free at last, free at last, free at last
Thank god almighty, we are free at last

In my heart, there's a rainbow glowing (in my heart)
In my head, there's a moon so bright (in my head)
In my sky, there's a snow cloud snowing (in my sky)

Sandman's coming out tonight

In my heart, there's a rainbow glowing (in my heart)
In my head, there's a moon so bright (in my head)
In my sky, there's a snow cloud snowing (in my sky)
