In the wee small hours of the mornin'
Before the break of dawn
While the air is still and quiet
And I lie awake alone
Before the plovers go swooping
And the flowers start to bloom
The rhythm of my heartbeat
Telling me I gotta move
To the keys of my piano
I hear a song
I hear a song

My hands start moving
And the noise begin to fly  
The bass starts grooving
And the beats feeling high
The melody's familiar
Like it's always been around
There's somethin' 'bout it's brand new
I can feel the power
Of the fever rising in my bones

I'm lost in the sound of a thousand violins
A symphony of harmony's about to begin
Mr. Maestro of the orchestra, raise your baton
I hear a song

When the muse comes knocking
I know I can't refuse
And the room starts rocking
To the rhythm and blues
And the sweet choir of voices 
Sing out so heavenly
Soul exploration
Is coming over me
And the music goes on and on

I'm lost in the sound of a thousand violins
A symphony of harmony's about to begin
Mr. Maestro of the orchestra, raise your baton
I hear a song
I hear a song
I hear a song
I hear a song
