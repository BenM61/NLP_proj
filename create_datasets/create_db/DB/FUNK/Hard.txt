Hard!
Hard!

Every single night
I've been without you girl
Is just so hard

Gotta take a flight south
'Cause I know that I 
was too hard
Should a been loving you (should a been loving)
I should a been loving you (should a been loving)

Girl I hate to say, but I gotta get back my name
I don't really hold my chain
To have money enough to get on this plane
And come and get my love
I ain't leaving til I get my love
Can you resist my heart and my soul?

(Hook)
I'm saying sorry now (saying sorry now)
But I know that ain't gonna cut it
So I'm changing now (so I'm changing now)
Yes I am (yes I am)

Every single night
I've been without you girl
Is just so hard

Gotta take a flight south
Cause I know that I was too hard
Should a been loving you (should a been loving)
I should a been loving you (should a been loving)

Really heh
Oh oh oh ooh
Really heh 
Oh oh oh ooh
Really heh
Oh oh oh ooh
Really heh yeah

ain't nobody ever loved me like you
I just figured it out
Maybe it's too late for me and you
I just can't picture that
(Hope it's not too late, Not too late for us)
Sometimes I feel like
Me and you's a must
