I had a woman that loved me true
To cut a long story short
We got married on our honeymoon
To cut a long story short

Now we're together I'm afraid no more
To cut a long story short
Like billions of other people we're divorced
To cut a long story short

I don't believe that you can possibly
Give more than you get
Unless you talk about taxation
And the money that you care to bet

When I've got a problem I want to solve
To cut a long story short
I simply go out and have a game of golf
To cut a long story short

But I read a book that the book was great
To cut a long story short
It got a fine class of people like the chambermaid
To cut a long story short

I don't see how you could possibly
Take what you can get
When to get what you take
And man you really got to sweat

I don't believe that you can possibly
Give more than you get
Unless you talk about taxation
And the money that you care to bet

I've got a girlfriend her name is Jill
To cut a long story short
She doesn't take chances
So she takes the pill

To cut a long story short
I'm really positive that she is mine
To cut a long story short
Now I'm getting married for the second time

To cut a long story short
I don't see how you could possibly
Take what you can get
When to get what you take
And man you really got to sweat
