I feel the touch of your hand
And I understand how much I need your love
You have given me wings
And I can do things I've never dreamed of
And I promise for as long as we're together
I will cherish this everlasting love 

Oh baby I need you so
You know that I can't let go
Always and forever I just want you to know
I wanna be where you are
No matter how near or far
And I wanna be the only one
Who can open the door to your heart
Oh baby I, oh baby I, oh baby I (x2)

All your secrets I'll keep
They're safe here with me
My arms will comfort you
There'll be no river too wide
No mountain too high
My heart will follow you
I'll go anywhere for as long as we're together
I will cherish this everlasting love 

Oh baby I need you so
You know that I can't let go
Always and forever I just want you to know
I wanna be where you are
No matter how near or far
And I wanna be the only one
Who can open the door to your heart
Oh baby I, oh baby I, oh baby I (x2)

There may be times some rain will fall
But I won't mind it if you're here with me
Oh, we'll get by and through it all
We'll have all of the love that we need, oh baby
Oh, oh baby
Oh, my darling
I'll go anywhere for as long as we're together
I will cherish this everlasting love 

Oh baby I need you so
You know that I can't let go
Always and forever I just want you to know
I wanna be where you are
No matter how near or far
And I wanna be the only one
Who can open the door 

Oh baby I need you so
Together our love will grow
Always and forever I just want you to know
I want to be where you are
No matter how near or far
And I want to be the only one
Who can open the door to your heart
