True
What the man say is true
All he's been telling you
Vapor trails align at evening time

We flew
In from the Cote D'Azur
Wearing our shades and sure
We were good to go in our Peugeot

We die
Each day and every night
Follow the swallows' flight
And we drank champagne like it was rain

We try
Try to outlast the day
Let that lone drummer play
Hell, I ain't afraid of the choice I made

It's true
All of this is true
All I've been telling you
From this rhyme it's the killing time, it's true

It's true, it's true, it's true
True, true, true

Helped by navigation so we went to the map
Half the way to China and we never came back

Helped by navigation so we went to the map
Half the way to China and we never came back

That night
Under the vineyard sky
We kissed and the world cried
As we hit descend and reached the end

So young
Deep in our hearts we knew
All I've been telling you is true

It's true
All of this is true
All I've been telling you
From this rhyme it's the killing time, it's true
All of this is true!
