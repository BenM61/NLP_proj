At the turn of the century
It was you and me
Making history baby
Always thought it was meant to be
We were humanely emotionally connected
I could have put it down to experience
I wish I put you down easy
My blue eyed boy
(I should have put you down)
My blue eyes
My blue eyed boy
(I should have put you down)
My blue eyes

I collected my dignity
With my mind at ease
I've burned your pictures and your memories
Put back all the pieces of me
So hard to see with rose tinted glasses
I should have put you down to experience
I wish I put you down easy

My blue eyed boy
(I should have put you down)
My blue eyes
My blue eyed boy
(I should have put you down)
My blue eyes

When all is said and done
We're sitting in the sun
Take life by the hand
To live on till content
Say I let you go
To be beautiful alone
And though I forget your smile
I remember those eyes
Those eyes

When all is said and done
We're sitting in the sun
Take life by the hand
To live on till content
Say I let you go
To be beautiful alone
And though I forget your smile
I remember those eyes
Those eyes

My blue eyed boy
(I should have put you down)
My blue eyes
My blue eyed boy
(I should have put you down)
My blue eyes

My blue eyed boy
(I should have put you down)
My blue eyes
My blue eyed boy
(I should have put you down)
My blue eyes
