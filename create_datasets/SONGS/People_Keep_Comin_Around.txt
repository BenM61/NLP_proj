You know I'll always wait
Each time you take a step
So rest yourself down here a while
Rest your sleepy little head

But how do I know if that's what you want
How do I know if you'd care
You'd better watch yourself
The way you're drifting

They watch you while you sleep
Giving it all that you need
They take you up into their arms
Listen to your dreams

What they know is what they know you know
What they say is all you hear
It's like a lullaby
The way you're drifting

I hear people keep comin' around
You better watch yourself
Don't talk so loud
I hear them comin' for you

People keep comin' around
You better watch yourself
No matter where you go
I hear them comin' for you now

Don't you know I'll always wait
Each time you take a step
So rest yourself down here a while
Rest your sleepy little head

So how do I know if that's what you want
Why do you care
Is that what you want, so tell me
Why do you care
How do I know if that's what you want
Why do you care
Is that what you want

I hear that people keep comin' around
You better watch yourself
Don't talk so loud
I hear them comin' for you

People keep comin' around
You better watch yourself
No matter where you go
I hear them comin' for you

People keep comin' around
You better watch yourself
Don't talk so loud
I hear them comin' for you

People keep comin' around
You better watch yourself
No matter where you go
I hear them comin' for you now

You keep turning
You keep running away
You keep turning
You keep running away

You keep turning
You keep running away
You keep turning

You know I'll always wait
You know I'll always wait
You know I'll always wait
I'll always wait
You know I'll always wait
You know I'll always wait
You know I'll always wait

I hear that people keep comin' around
You better watch yourself
Don't talk so loud
I hear them comin' for you

People keep comin' around
You better watch yourself
No matter where you go
I hear them comin' for you now
