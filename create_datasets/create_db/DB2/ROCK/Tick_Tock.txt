One night while sleeping in my bed I had a beautiful dream
That all the people of the world got together on the same wavelength
And began helping one another
Now in this dream, universal love was the theme of the day
Peace and understanding and it happened this way

The sick and the hungry, had smiles on their faces
The tired and the homeless had family all around
Streets and the cities were all beautiful places
And the walls came tumblin' down

People of the world, all had it together
Had it together for the boys and the girls
And the children of the world look forward to a future

Remember, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock people
Time's tickin' away
Remember that, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock people
Time's tickin' away

I had a vision of blue skies from sea to shining sea
All the trees in the forest stood strong tall again
Everything was clean and pretty and safe for you and me
The worst of enemies became the best of friends

People of the world, all had it together
Had it together for the boys and the girls
Children of the world look forward to a future

Remember, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock people
Time's tickin' away
Remember that, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock people
Time's tickin' away

Remember that, remember that
Remember that, remember that

People of the world all had it together
Had it together for the boys and the girls
Children of the world look forward to a future

Remember, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock people
Time's tickin' away
Remember that, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock people
Time's tickin' away

Remember that, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock people
Time's tickin' away
Remember tick tock, tick tock, tick tock people
Time's tickin' away

Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock people
Time's tickin' away
Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock people
Time's tickin' away

Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock people
Time's tickin' away
