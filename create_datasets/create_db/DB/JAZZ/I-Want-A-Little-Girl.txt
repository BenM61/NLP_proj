I want a little girl to call my own,
Just a girl that's all alone,
A little girl to fall in love with me.
I want a little girl, she may not look
like the kind in a story book,
But if she can cook she'll suit me to a tee!

She doesn't have to wave her hand,
Or dress in fancy clothes,
And I wouldn't even care
If she didn't wear none at all!

I want a little girl to have a lot,
I would give her anything I've got
For a little girl to fall in love with me.

She doesn't have to wave her hand,
Or dress in fancy clothes,
And I wouldn't even care
If she didn't wear silken hose!

I want a little girl to have a lot,
I would give her anything I've got
For a little girl to fall in love with me.
