Long days and lonely nights
Makes the morning seem so bright
But when my feet they hit the ground
I know that I'm safe and sound
My foolish self don't have to be
More than just a memory
Cause when I come on back around
It's the new me coming thought I've found

When I come back around 
Wake up and look all around
When I come back around
Wake up and look all around
When I come back around
Wake up and look all around
Waiting for you to come on back
When I come back around
Wake up and look all around

Don't ask me why I do that stuff
Take it too far it's never enough
Spiraling self loathing styles
Hanging out
With audiophiles
But when I start to wake
From the hypnogagic state
Feel that I can see the light
Come on up from day to night

When I come back around 
Wake up and look all around
When I come back around
Wake up and look all around
When I come back around
Wake up and look all around
Waiting for you to come on back
When I come back around
Wake up and look all around

But when I start to wake 
From the hypnogogic state
Feel that I can see the light
Come on up from day to night

When I come back around 
Wake up and look all around
When I come back around
Wake up and look all around
When I come back around
Wake up and look all around
Waiting for you to come on back
When I come back around
Wake up and look all around
