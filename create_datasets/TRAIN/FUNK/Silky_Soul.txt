There was a man I knew
Who was smooth as smooth can be
His music his smile
And his sweet sweet melody
Do you recall that mentor
And the voice with the velvet touch
I'll never forget how he moved us all so much
Do you remember
That special one that very special one
I do remember
How much he's done
I can still here his sweet song
Silky silky soul singer
Silky silky soul singer
Silky silky soul singer
Silky silky soul singer
The man was smooth as silk

As he danced across the floor
His music that style
Made you want to see much more
And most of all was inside
Was a heart as pure as gold
I do believe that magic
Lives and never can grow old
Do you remember
That special one that very special one
I do remember
How much the man has done
I can still here his sweet song
Silky silky soul singer
Silky silky soul singer
Silky silky soul singer
Silky silky soul singer
