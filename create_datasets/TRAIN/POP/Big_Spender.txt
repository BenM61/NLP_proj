The minute you walked in the joint 
I could see you were a man of distinction 
A real big spender 
Good lookin' so refined 
Say, wouldn't you like to know what's goin' on in my mind? 
So let me get right to the point 
I don't pop my cork for every man I see 
Hey big spender, 
Spend a little time with me 

Wouldn't you like to have fun, fun, fun 
How's about a few laughs, laughs
I could show you a good time 
Let me show you a good time! 

The minute you walked in the joint 
I could see you were a man of distinction 
A real big spender 
Good lookin' so refined 
Say, wouldn't you like to know what's goin' on in my mind? 
So let me get right to the point, 
I don't pop my cork for every guy I see 
Hey big spender
Hey big spender
Hey big spender 
Spend, a little time with me 
Yes
