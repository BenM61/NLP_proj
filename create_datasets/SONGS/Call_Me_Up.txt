Call me up, if I'm home
Don't say too much, I might be upset
Let us agree to differ
We're consumed by competition

Having fun is my reason for living
(Give me a break)
Having fun is my reason for living
(Give me a break)

Call me up, if I'm alone
I don't like to spend too much time on my own
I need to have diversion
Consume me with a new passion

Having fun is my reason for living
(Give me a break)
Having fun is my reason for living
(Give me a break)

We are all in competition
Better move fast gobble up your dinner
Take a tip, get hip!
It's not so bad in the promised land
It's not so bad in the promised land
It's not so bad in the promised land
How do I fill my days?
A force called "hard cash" moves my feet

We are all in competition
It's the one thing that is simple
We are all in competition
It's not so bad in the promised land

Having fun is my reason for living
(Give me a break)
Having fun is my reason for living
(Give me a break)

Children of the pleasure culture
Who must be grateful for what we've got
Happy smiles in sunny climes
So don't upset the ice-cream cart

Having fun is my reason for living
(Give me a break)
Having fun is my reason for living
(Give me a break)
Having fun is my reason for living
(Give me a break)
Having fun is my reason for living
(Give me a break)
