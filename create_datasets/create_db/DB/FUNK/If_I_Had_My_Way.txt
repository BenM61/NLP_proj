Baby, baby
You don't know how many nights I've prayed
For a man like you to come my way
If you knew the things that I've been through
To find someone like you

I was lookin' for love
Givin' my love, just to be taken for granted
And thrown away
But we both played the fool a time or two

And If I had my way
I would turn the hands of time
Back to the time in my life
When I foolishly gave love away

And If I had my way
I wouldn't have waited just for you
Knowin' you'd love like you do
There'll be no regrets of yesterday
If I had my way
My way, my way, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah

Honey, honey
If I knew back then what I know now
I would reckon our true love [?]
After givin' body, soul and tears
It up and disappear

I was lookin' for love
Oh, but I'm crazy
Givin' my love, just to be taken for granted
And thrown away
But we all play the fool a time or two

If I had my way
I would turn the hands of time
Back to the time in my life
When I foolishly gave love away

And If I had my way
I wouldn't have waited just for you
Knowin' you'd love like you do
There'll be no regrets of yesterday

If I had my way
I would turn the hands of time
Back to the time in my life
When I foolishly gave love away

If I had my way
I wouldn't have waited just for you
Knowin' you'd love like you do
There'll be no regrets of yesterday
If I had my way, my way, my way, my way

I was lookin' for love
Givin' my love, just to be taken for granted
And thrown away
But we both played the fool a time or two

If I had my way
I would turn the hands of time
Back to the time in my life
When I foolishly gave love away

If I had my way
I wouldn't have waited just for you
Knowin' you'd love like you do
There'll be no regrets of yesterday

If I had my way
I would turn the hands of time
Back to the time in my life
When I foolishly gave love away

If I had my way
I wouldn't have waited just for you
Knowin' you'd love like you do
There'll be no regrets of yesterday
If I had my way, my way, my way
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah

If I had my way today
I'd go back and make a change
Take my love back from the one
Who have a low down, oh my God

If I had my way today
I'd go back and make a change
Take my love back from the one
Who has a low down

If I had my way
I would turn the hands of time
Back to the time in my life
When I foolishly gave love away
