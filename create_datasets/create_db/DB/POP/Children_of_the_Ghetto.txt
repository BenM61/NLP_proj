Children of the ghetto
Runnin' wild and free
In the concrete jungle
Filled with misery
There's no inspiration
To brighten up their day
So out of desperation
I would like to say

Children of the ghetto
Keep your head
To the sky

Children of the ghetto
Are always in the news
Toughness is their moto
And bitter are their blues
But deep inside the ghetto
There's a unity
Their councils are for sorrows
And no misery

Children of the ghetto
Keep your head
To the sky
To the sky

God's your inspiration
To brighten up your day
Don't you know
So better consolation
I would like to say

Children of the Ghetto
Keep your head
To the sky

Saved with me
There's so many children
Keep your head up
Keep it
Keep it up
Saved with me
There's so many children
Keep your heard up
Keep it
Keep it up

Don't you know
Everything
Is gonna be alright
If you just
Keep it up
Keep it up
Keep it up
Everything
Surely is gonna be alright
If you just
