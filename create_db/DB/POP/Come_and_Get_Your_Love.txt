How long must I sit around waiting you
Think of all the heartache 
You been putting me through
You must have a soul 
But it don't show
Come on and love me
Let me know

Come and get your love (Get your love)
Come and get your love (Get your love)
Come and get your love (Get your love)
Come and get your love (Get your love)
Come and get your love, before I give it away 

(Come and get it)
You're a devil witch
And I'm hypnotized
But woman I could see right through your eyes
Here's something for you
(I Can't)
Take it from me
Why don't you love me?
Or set me free

Or come and get your love (Get your love)
Come and get your love (Get your love)
Come and get your love (Get your love)
Come and get your love (Get your love)
Come and get your love before I give it away

(Come and get it)
(Come on baby, get your love)
(Come on baby, get your love)
(Come on baby, get your love)
(Come on baby, get your love)
(Come on baby, get your love)
(Come on baby, get your love)

I've been holding on 
To your love for so long
Could be I would tie you up
The face I admire
So why don't you say
Just go away

Or come and get your love (Get your love)
Get your love (Get your love)
Come and get your love (Get your love)
Come and get your love (Get your love)
Come and get your love before I give it away

(Come and get it)
Come on get down come and get your love (Come and get it)
Get your love oh baby (Come on baby get your love)
Here I am (Come on baby get your love)
Waiting for you (Come on baby get your love)
Get your love (Come on baby get your love)
How long (Come on baby
