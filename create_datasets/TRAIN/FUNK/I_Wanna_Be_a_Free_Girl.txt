I was there when dreams came true
Stuck around when they fell through
Life's too short to play with your emotions
I gotta travel, I gotta travel
Said I wanna see the world
I wanna be a free girl
Said I wanna see the world
I gotta be a free girl, mmm
The silly games you played weren't new
Lost them all
But they beat you, too
There's no time for fooling with children
I gotta travel, I gotta travel
Said I wanna see the world
I gotta be a free girl
Yes, I wanna see the world
I gotta be a free girl, oh
Oh, life's too short to play with your emotions
I gotta travel, I gotta travel
Said I wanna see the world
I gotta be a free girl
Yes I wanna see the world
I gotta be a free girl
Yes I wanna see the world
I gotta be a free girl
Said I wanna see the world
