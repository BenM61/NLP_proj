I've reached a decision
It's time to rearrange my life
We're speaking the same words
Although their meaning has changed
You're telling me what I want to hear
But what's the use when we just don't share
The same emotions that brought us together aren't there

In this world, nothing lasts forever
Was it you who changed or me
Should we go our separate ways or stay together
Believe me when I say

I'm not gonna change
I'm not gonna change now
If you walk away
There's no turning back now

I look in the mirror
And see a reflection that isn't me
It's hard to remember the girl that used to be me
In this world, nothing lasts forever
Was it you who changed or me
Should we go our separate ways or stay together
Believe me when I say

I'm not gonna change
I'm not gonna change now
If you walk away
There's no turning back now

I'm not gonna change
I'm not gonna change now
If you walk away
There's no turning back now

In this world, nothing lasts forever
Was it you who changed or me
Should we go our separate ways or stay together
Believe me when I say

I'm not gonna change
I'm not gonna change now
If you walk away
There's no turning back now

I'm not gonna change
I'm not gonna change now
If you walk away
There's no turning back now

I'm not gonna change
I'm not gonna change now
If you walk away
There's no turning back now

I'm not gonna change
I'm not gonna change now
If you walk away
There's no turning back now
