One Night of Love
Grace Moore 
(V. Schertzinger)

One Night Of Love
When two hearts are one,
A night to have and hold
When love is gone and starlight grows cold.

One Night Of Love
When love is all that I'll recall.
When at the break of dawn
I find my lover gone
I'll whisper with a smile
I've lived a little while
I've known One Night Of Love.
