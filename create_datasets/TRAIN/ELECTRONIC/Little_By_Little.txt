None of these things make sense in my mind
I've been hunting hallow and I get off too far from the light
Even when life is getting too rough
I can't help myself 
I just can't get enough

Little by little, I'm losing my side
Little by little, I'm falling behind
Little by little, I'm slipping out of line
Little by little, I'm reclaiming what's mine

A bound has been the ways I went
But it all caused love ain't heaven sent
And sorrow sell, my favorite waste of time
And I keep on going, but don't know what to find

Little by little, I'm losing my side
Little by little, I'm falling behind
Little by little, I'm slipping out of line
Little by little, I'm reclaiming what's mine

Little by little, I'm losing my side
Little by little, I'm falling behind
Little by little, I'm slipping out of line
Little by little, I'm reclaiming what's mine
