Oh, oh, oh

Been working all the week
I ain't got no time to sleep
I got plenty when I die
Alright

The night has just begun
Are you ready, here I come
I'll be dancing till the morning light

I come alive when the sun goes down, sun goes down
The city noise makes a beautiful sound, beautiful sound
Lose all control going all in tonight, lose all control going all in tonight

So put your hands up, hands up
You know you can't stop, can't stop
So put your hands up, hands up
Oh, oh, oh

Just put your hands up, hands up
'Cause we can't get enough, get enough
So put your hands up, hands up
Oh, oh, oh
Now will you dance with me?

Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

We're gonna live it up
Bring it on no matter what
You know there's no way but up
Right now

So put the needle on the record
The world is looking better
When we're spinning round
And around, yeah

We come alive to the neon lights
Turn the music up 'cause the feeling's alright
Hold back the dawn, no we can't stop now
Can't stop now, now, now, now, now, now

So put your hands up, hands up
You know you can't stop, can't stop
So put your hands up, hands up
We can't stop
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

We come alive when the sun goes down
The city noise makes a beautiful sound
Oh, oh, oh
Come on and dance with me! 

Hands up, hands up

So put your hands up, hands up
You know you can't stop, can't stop
So put your hands up, hands up
Oh, oh, oh

Just put your hands up, hands up
'Cause we can't get enough, get enough
So put your hands up, hands up
Oh, oh, oh
Come on and dance with me! 

Hands up
Oh, oh, yeah
Hands up
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
