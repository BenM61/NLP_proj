no matter what you are i'm so in love with you
no matter how you've made me cry i really care
no matter what you've done no matter what you do
you are my only one i love no matter who 
oh i care for you just like i did before
just like i love you then i love you still
oh baby i'll care for you care for you
until my days are through
for loving you is still my only thrill
no matter what you are
i hope that you will change for it will make no matter then
for it will make no matter then that you were once so strange.
