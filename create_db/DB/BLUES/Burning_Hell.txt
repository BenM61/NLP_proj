Everybody talk about it
Burning hell
Ain't no heaven, I know
Ain't no burning hell
Where I die I go
Can't nobody tell

I am going, Deacon Jones
I went down to the church house
I got down on my bended knee
I prayed, I prayed all night, I prayed
Deacon Jones, pray for me

I went down to the church house
I got down on my knee
I begged, Deacon Jones to pray for me
He said, son, here my hand

Ain't no heaven
Ain't no burning hell

Ain't no heaven, ain't no heaven, no burning hell
When I die, where I go, nobody know

No burning hell
Ain't no burning, no burning hell
When I die, in my grave, nobody know where I'm going
Ain't no heaven, ain't no hell
When I die, nobody tell

Hey hey, hey hey
Deacon Jones, pray for me

I don't believe, I don't believe in no heaven
I don't believe in no hell
When I die, where I go, nobody know
