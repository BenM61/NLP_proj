Ooh la, la, la, la.
I did you wrong, my heart went out to play 
And in the game I lost you, what a price to pay!
I'm cryin', ooh baby baby ooh baby baby
 
Mistakes I know I've made a few, 
But I'm only human;  you've made mistakes too!
I'm cryin', ooh baby baby ooh baby baby
 
Ooh baby baby
Ooh baby baby I'm just about at the end of my rope.
But I can't stop tryin', I can't give up hope 
'cause I feel someday I'll hold you near, 
Whisper I still love you 
Until that day is here ooh I'm cryin'.
 
Ooh baby baby ooh baby baby
