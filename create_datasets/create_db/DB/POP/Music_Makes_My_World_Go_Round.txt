Please don't say, I'm losing you
We went so wrong and it's all over, over again
Don't you tell me that it's true
And there is nothing I can do?

Won't you try to understand
It ain't so simple but I hope that I can explain
Won't you let me take your hand
'cause that's the place I need to land

Music makes my world go round
And music gets me high and keeps me on the ground
In music I feel safe and sound
Get lost and still be found

Please don't ever make me choose
If only I think about it, I go insane
Don't you leave me now my muse
'cause all my love you can't refuse

Music makes my world go round
Music gets me high and keeps me on the ground
Music makes my world go round
Music lifts me up when you're, you're not around
In music I feel safe and sound
Get lost and still be found

Instrumental

Please don't say, I'm losing you
We went so wrong and it's all over, over again
Don't you tell me that it's true
And there is nothing I can do?
