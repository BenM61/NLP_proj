Beck, Stewart, Wood) 
I used to work and take a salary
In a hole up near a foundry
But it did not take me too long
To get my boots on a "So Long!"
Long Spanish boots on a "So Long!"
I took a day job in Bethlehem
I nearly threw in the towel then
But it did not take me too long
To get my boots on a "So Long!"
High Spanish boots on a "So Long!"

Dig it
I took a Spanish haberdashery
Restored with 15th century tapestry
But oh, Mr. Nesbitt got the best of me
So I strapped on my boots and said "So Long!"
Laced up my high boots and "So Long!"

Goodbye
Am on a job you see
'Cause my old boots they mean too much to me
Leather boots are just a mystery
Put on my boots and said "So Long!"
High Spanish boots on and "So Long!"
Put on my boots and said "So Long!"
Those old Spanish boots
Put on my boots and said "So Long!"
High Spanish boots
