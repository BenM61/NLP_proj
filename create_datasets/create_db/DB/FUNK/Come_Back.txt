I got that comeback
The hubba bubba
I got the run back
Run back and tell you mother
I throw the Ra-Ra
Only up when they go all the way down
I got a lifetime warranty
Guaranteed
You'll never leave

Warning
Beware, handle with care
If you're lucky
There's a chance you'll make it there
This is serious
Girls like me is so rare

Once I get that
Imma put that on him
Put that, put that, put that on him

Now I know what I'm doing
Whatchu gon' do with this?
I'll let you catch a feeling
With just a little bit
Don't wanna rush into it
And catch a sugar fit

Once I get that
Imma put that on him
Put that, put that, put that on him

I got that comeback
The hubba bubba
I got the run back
Run back and tell you mother
I throw the Ra-Ra
Only up when they go all the way down
I got a lifetime warranty
Guaranteed
You'll never leave

Caution
Keep away from open flames
Cause it's hot hot hot
Fire marshals can't contain it
You need rehab
Cos this thing is so addictive

When you put that on her
Put that on her
