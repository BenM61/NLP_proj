Vernon'll meet me when the boat lands
Keys to th M. G. will be in his hands
Adjust to the driving 'n' I'm on my way
It's all on the right side in Montego Bay
 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Come sing me la!  Come sing me Montego Bay
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 
'N' Gillian'll meet me like a brother would
I think I remember but it's twice as good
Like how cool the rum is from his silver tray
I thirst to be thirsty in Montego Bay. Sing out
 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Come sing me la!  Come sing me Montego Bay
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 
I'll lay on a  lilo till I'm lobster red
I still feel the motion here at home in bed
I tell you it's hard for me to stay away
You ain't been till you been high in Montego Bay
 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Come sing me la!  Come sing me Montego Bay
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
