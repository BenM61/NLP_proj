All the fools who await your return
May we tell them the truth
There's no way you can turn back the clock
Never cling to your youth
How unfortunate it must have been
Life is only a race
You're so old that it might take a crane
Just to lift back your face
Scientific so scientific
Scientific so scientific
But you were walking on glass
How unstable we bolt with the horse
Setting music to muscle
All the fallers who litter the course
As we run to the castle
Scientific so scientific
Scientific so scientific
But you were walking on glass
Careful - you're walking on glass
 you're walking on glass
When you say that the sun does not move
Did it show you the answer
When the ships do not fall off the world
Does it mean there's a wall there
You say the sun does not move
Careful - you could be walking on glass
He could see that the earth was a mover
And the sun was a mother
But he was walking on glass
