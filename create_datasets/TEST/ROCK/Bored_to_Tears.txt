Tired of this 
Done with that 
Never satisfied with where I'm at 
I sit and think 
What to do 
Just a motherfuckin' bore 
Without a clue 

Shot my drugs 
Drank my booze 
Tired of joy and self abuse 
Eternally jaded through and through 
Just a self loathing dick 
Without a clue 

Oh 
Bored to death 
I'm just bored to tears 
Same old shit just different day & year 
Killed myself but that got boring too 
So beyond the point where it's not true 

Far beyond high 
Dramatically low 
Eternal stare as if I care to know 
All of this struggle 
All of this work 
In the end you die like some moronic jerk 

Shot my drugs 
Drank my booze 
Tired of joy and self abuse 
Eternally jaded through and through 
Just a self loathing f*ck 
Without a clue 

Oh 
Bored to death 
I'm just bored to tears 
Same old shit just different day & year 
Killed myself but that got boring too 
So beyond the point where it's not true 

The colors I see are all bleeding 
The sound that was is now standing still 
I wonder when it was it all faded 
A dullen corpse that cannot be killed 

Oh 
Bored to death 
I'm just bored to tears 
Same old shit just different day & year 
Killed myself but that got boring too 
So beyond the point where it's not true 

The rose petalled garden 
Yeah...

Alone in the garden 
And all that would be 
Alone in the garden 
You thought would set you free 
Nowhere to draw water 
And if you could it would be damned 
Go on turn your back now 
On everything... 

Yeah...
