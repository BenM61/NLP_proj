No mad, mad world and no mad hatters
No one's pitchin cause their ain't no batters

The oceans roar, were double drummin
Of many silly thoughts and silly ways

The ocean breeze has cooled my mind
The salty days are her's and mine

And softly she will speak the stars
Until sun-up

It's all from havin' someone knowin'	
Just which way your head is blowin'	
Who's always warm like in the mornin'	
In Coconut Grove
