Well I'm happy now
I don't need a drink to toast to our health
Now the sun is out
And the rain is falling somewhere else

There is misery somewhere
But I don't know and I don't care
Since you took it from my shoulders

I love rock and roll
It took my hand and it touched my soul
You do that as well
You know, you know, you know yourself
But you beat notes and rhymes
Any day, any time

When you walk in a room
You bring in joy and dispel gloom
Your sunny side
It makes my smile a mile wide
You charisma is profound
True love follows you around
And lays its head upon your shoulder

I love rock and roll
It took my hand and it touched my soul
You do that as well
You know, you know, you know yourself
But you beat notes and rhymes
Any day, any time

I wonder why it's no good without you
Like there's a mystery
When I know the only cure for heartache
Is a woman that I long to see
Standing right in front of me

If we lived a million lives
I would love you every time
And be right there by your shoulder

I love rock and roll
It took my hand and it touched my soul
You do that as well
You know, you know, you know yourself
But you beat notes and rhymes
Any day, any time
