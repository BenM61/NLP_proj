Who made up all the rules
We follow them like fools
Believe them to be true
Don't care to think them through

And I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry it's like this
I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry, we do this

And it's ironic too
'Coz what we tend to do
Is act on what they say
And then it is that way

And I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry it's like this
I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry, we do this

Who are they?
And where are they?
And how can they possibly
Know all this?

Who are they?
And where are they?
And how can they possibly
Know all this?

Do you see what I see?
Why do we live like this?
Is it because it's true
That ignorance is bliss?

Who are they?
And where are they?
And how do they
Know all this?

And I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry it's like this

Do you see what I see?
Why do we live like this?
Is it because it's true
That ignorance is bliss?

And who are they?
And where are they?
And how can they
Know all this?

And I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry we do this
