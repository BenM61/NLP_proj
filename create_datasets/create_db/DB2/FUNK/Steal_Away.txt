C'mon and hold me 
Just like you told me
Then show me
What I want to know

Why don't we steal away
Why don't we steal away 
Into the night
I know it ain't right
Tease me, why don't you please me
Then show me 
What you came here for

Why don't we steal away
Why don't we steal away 
Into the night
I know it ain't right
Into the night babe
Make it tonight ooohh

I caught you glancing my way
And I know what you're after (no second chances tonight)

Why don't we steal away
Why don't we steal away
Why don't we steal away
Why don't we steal away
Into the night

I know it ain't right
Into the night
I know it ain't right 
Why don't we steal away
I know it ain't right 
Into the night, babe
Why don't we steal away
Make it tonight
Why don't we steal away
