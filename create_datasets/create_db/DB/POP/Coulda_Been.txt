It's hard
To believe
We weren't to be
And all good things end eventually
But here I am
Walking away
And you're down on your knees
Begging me, please baby stay
Well no can do
'Cause boy you were untrue
The only rule
There is no exception to
3's a crowd
So where does that leave you now
That's what you get for living loud
Remember

Coulda been right
Coulda been cool
Coulda been the best thing since high school
Coulda been wild
Coulda been free
You coulda been everything to me
Coulda been real
Coulda been hot
Coulda been the one who hits my spot
But you're not
And all you got
Is something that coulda been
But you're not
And all you got 
Is something that coulda been

I used to think 
I couldn't live without us together
But boy look at me now
I got my hopes
My whole life and all my dreams
So as you wave goodbye to me
Just remember

Coulda been right
Coulda been cool
Coulda been the best thing since high school
Coulda been wild
Coulda been free
You coulda been everything to me
Coulda been real
Coulda been hot
Coulda been the one who hits my spot
But you're not
And all you got
Is something that coulda been
But you're not
And all you got 
Is something that coulda been

Someday you'll see me walking down the street
Looking all confident and complete
Wondering if you made a mistake
Threw it away too soon
I'll wave and blow you a kiss
And say it's cool running into you like this
How you doing? Have any kids?
Do you ever look back and wish that 
You could turn, turn back time
And make me change my mind
But you didn't so
Let's get on with letting go
Almost doesn't count you no
So remember remember
So remember remember

Coulda been right
Coulda been cool
Coulda been the best thing since high school
Coulda been wild
Coulda been free
You coulda been everything to me
Coulda been real
Coulda been hot
Coulda been the one who hits my spot
But you're not
And all you got
Is something that coulda been
Coulda been right
Coulda been cool
Coulda been the best thing since high school
Coulda been wild
Coulda been free
You coulda been everything to me
Coulda been real
Coulda been hot
Coulda been the one who hits my spot
But you're not
And all you got
Is something that coulda been
But you're not
And all you got 
Is something that coulda been
But you're not
And all you got 
Is something that coulda been
