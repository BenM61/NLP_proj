I got a room at the top of the world tonight 
 I can see everything tonight 
 I got a room where everyone 
 Can have a drink and forget those things 
 That went wrong in their life 

 I got a room at the top of the world tonight 
 I got a room at the top of the world tonight 
 I got a room at the top of the world tonight 
 And I ain't comin' down, I ain't comin' down 

 I got someone who loves me tonight 
 I got over a thousand dollars in the bank 
 And I'm all right 
 Look deep in the eyes of love 
 Look deep in the eyes of love 
 And find out what you were looking for 

 I got a room at the top of the world tonight 
 I got a room at the top of the world tonight 
 I got a room at the top of the world tonight 
 And I ain't comin' down, no I ain't comin' down 

 I wish I could feel you tonight, little one 
 You're so far away 
 I want to reach out and touch your heart 
 Yeah like they do in those things on TV, I love you 
 Please love me, I'm not so bad 
 And I love you so 

 I got a room at the top of the world tonight 
 I got a room at the top of the world tonight 
 I got a room at the top of the world tonight 
 And I ain't comin' down, no I ain't comin' down 
 I ain't comin' down
