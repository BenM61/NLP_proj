Big size, small size
Any size, round and round
We need, we take
Burn it all to the ground
Started over and learned to walk
We teach you how to talk
Please try and understand
We're helping all mankind
We use them a while then it's over the shoulder
We use them a while then it's over the shoulder

We are serious
O, serious
Dollar here, dollar there
Dollars flying everywhere
We're only here to please
Stop the killing, trust me
We'll only be a while
Big while, big big smile
We use them a while then it's over the shoulder
We use them a while then it's over the shoulder

We have in our hands
Every woman and every man
Things are gonna go far
Down a real big fast car
And what you see is what you get
Keep 'em hungry, you bet
You need security
To keep you from the enemy
We use them a while then it's over the shoulder
We use them a while then it's over the shoulder
