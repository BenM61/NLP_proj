On the floor can you feel it 
Yes definitely 
On the floor can you feel it 
I've been here moving all night 

On the floor do you mean it 
Does it really matter 
On the floor can you feel it 
Oh I can 

I need a time that's physical 
The moment's yours you have it 
You are the one that I adore 
And you can see I want it 

Some people born to criticise 
It's just a song get on it 
Do not forget you're an animal 
So let it out 

I've got to feel it 
And set the record straight 
Because I'm singing 
To set the record straight 

On the floor can you feel it 
I've been smiling loads 
On the floor can you feel it 
Yeah 

I've come a long way from my home 
On the floor do you mean it 
Why sure 
I put a foot in my mouth sometime 
On the floor can you feel it 
I can feel all right 

I need a time that's physical 
The moments yours you have it 
You are the one that I adore 
And you can see I want it 

Some people born to criticise 
It's just a song get on it 
Do not forget I'm animal so let it out 

I've got to feel it 
To set the record straight 
Because I'm singing 
To set the record straight 

I'd open your mind 
But you've got to find it 
All I say to you 
Is don't criticise 

Because you half don't mind it 
All good things to you 
I'd open your mind 
But you've got to find it 

All I say to you 
I've got to feel it and 
Set the record straight 
Because I'm singing 
To set the record straight
