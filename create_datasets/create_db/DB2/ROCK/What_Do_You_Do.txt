I wear these old shoes with the holes in
To remind me of the million
Miles that I have walked beside you
Good and bad times we have been through

You know the car you drive
Keeps breaking down it never starts
But it reminds me of you and me in the back seat
Driving it home and now I'm all alone

What do you do? What do you do?
When everything is broken
What do you say? What do you say?
When no words fit the moment

'Cause you're not here and even if you were
All I could say is
What do I do? What do I do?
We're broken but I can't throw us away

Looking out the window
With the scratches on it at the sun
The world looks different when you're looking
Through a lens like a Picasso

The sky is bitter twisted just like you and me, I miss it
You snap it, bend it, burn it, break it
Then you find that you can't fix it
Fall back on whatever still remains

What do you do? What do you do?
When everything is broken
What do you say? What do you say?
When no words fit the moment

'Cause you're not here and even if you were
All I could say is
What do I do? What do I do?
We're broken but I can't throw us away

Breaking you in, breaking your heart
I was taking it all and I tore you apart
Breaking me in, breaking my heart
And the damage was done

But I took what you got
We were breakin' it, smashin' it
Takin' it, lovin' it, hatin' it
Drivin' it home and now I'm all, now I'm all alone
