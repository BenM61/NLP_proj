I will be here when you are gone
So I have the right to a power gorge
And I will be good at making bad
And I'll light the way for the fucking mad
I will defeat what I'm heading for
And I will be here for evermore
And I am the way of your empty shell
I want more than I am

Cause I was made to fly
Cause I was made to fly
And you were made to die
But I was made to fly

I will survive cause I want more
And I will create a bigger war
And I will rule over and give you hell
And then you will do as I command
Cause I will be here when you are gone
Yeah I'll still be here when you are gone
I'll fill you with fear of the holy son
I want all that I am

Cause I was made to fly
Yeah, I was made to fly
You were made to die
But I was made to fly

I will defeat you
I will defeat you
I will defeat you
I will defeat you
I will defeat you
I will defeat you
I will defeat you
I will defeat you

Manipulate interrogate compete all you like
And dominate with forceful hate
Cause you know I will defeat you

You were made to fly
Yeah, you were made to fly
I was made to fly
But you were made to die

Cause I was made to fly
Yeah, I was made to fly
And you were made to fly
But I was made to fly

I will defeat you
