Baby I need your good lovin'
Got to have your love right now
Baby
So come and fill my empty arms and
Make my life worthwhile

Because
I'm not livin', baby
I only exist
I'll never laugh, I'll never smile no more
I don't care if I stay like this, because

Without the one you love, life is not worthwhile
Without your love my dear I'm like a fatherless child
So come and fill my empty arms and
Make my life worthwhile

When I feel the hurt comin' on
I stop and cry like I'm cryin' (right now)
People ask why would a grown man cry
I drop my head and I sigh and reply

Without the one you love, life is not worthwhile
Without your love my dear I'm like a fatherless child
So come and fill my empty arms and
Make my life worthwhile

(Baby I need your good lovin')
Sometimes I feel like a wanderer
(Got to have your love right now)
Searching for peace within
(Baby I need your good lovin')
I need you my darling
(Got to have your love right now)
Like a lost soul needs a friend

So come and fill my empty arms and
Fill my empty life

(Baby I need your good lovin')
Nobody knows the emptiness I feel
(Got to have your love right now)
And I feel it
(Baby I need your good lovin')
Nobody knows the loneliness I feel
(Got to have your love right now)
And I feel it because

Without the one you love, life is not worthwhile
Without your love my dear I'm like a fatherless child
So come and fill my empty arms and
Make my life worthwhile

Without the one you love, life is not worthwhile
Without your love my dear I'm like a fatherless child
Without the one you love, life is not worthwhile
