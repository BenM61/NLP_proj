Trying to find chinatown
A hungry man
Can hold out a long time

For some soul food
Good food, whole food
I know I was that man
Maybe sometimes hold out a little too long

I took a right
Then I took a wrong turn
Someone asked me for a quarter
It didn't seem to fit

He didn't look too much like a chinaman

Trying to find chinatown
An old black man

Pushing a shopping trolley
Filled with tin cans
Avoided his glance
I'm nervous and I'm lost

And I don't see too many restaurants
A guy laid out
With a knife in his back
A cop came along

Told him, move on
Go home and sleep it off
I didn't know if I should get involved
