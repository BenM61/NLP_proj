Chased you out of this world, didn't mean to stop
I turned around and suddenly you where gone
Like some bird from paradise, the fire and ice
We turned around and suddenly you where gone, gone, gone
And now summer burns a hole inside and years are golden once again
My thoughts return to you my dear young friend

Oh come this way
Will you look down this way
I go down on the street
Where the wild wind's blowing
Here comes a hurricane

I say come down this way
Will you look down this way
I need you tonight
I need you around me

I'm looking through the windows
And my mind goes in a whirl
Well there's a multitude of candles
Burning in the windows of this world
I'm looking at the colours
Checking out the straights
I'm counting out the numbers
Will tomorrow never change?

Still I hear you and I love you
And I'll follow you elsewhere
And I'll remember this occasion
I'll remember being aware

'Cause we've got panic in the evening
We've got fall-out in the streets
And I hear you and I follow you
And I'll call out and I'll say
That I can hear your sister call out
And I hear her call your name
They're calling sweet surrender
And things won't be the same
And don't you think that I don't care
And don't you think that I don't know
And don't you hear them calling out
In a place not far from here

And I hear big wheels are turning
Some things are not to fear
They say this is the time and place
They call street fighting years

And I hear great wheels are turning
And I tell you not to fear
They say this is the time and place
They call street fighting years

And I love you, I look for you
And I walk to you, I walk to you
And I hear big wheels are turning
Is there no way out of here?
They'll be calling out tomorrow
