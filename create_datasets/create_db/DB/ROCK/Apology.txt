Well you say I owe you something
What could that be
If I could it would
Be a blessing
To return all the things that
You gave to me
If I could it would
Put my mind at ease

But shut up
You don't want my opinion
Won't listen to an explanation
You cut me off
Never did want to see
My side of the story

Well you say I owe you something
What could that be
An apology
You've got to be kidding
How long will you be waiting
Just like I did
For something impossible
With bated breath
