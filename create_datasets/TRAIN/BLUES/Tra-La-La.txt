Tra la la, tra la la
You're as sweet as a candy bar
Tra la la, tra la ly
I'm so happy that I could die

Tra la la, tra la la
You're as cute as a movie star
Tra la la, tra la lo
I'd be crazy to let you go

Tra la la, tra la loo
All my lovin' is just for you
Tra la la, tra la la
A wolf whistle goes, I don't know how, so I'm a-singin'

Tra la la, tra la la
I love you just the way you are
Tra la la, tra la lee
I'm as happy as I can be
