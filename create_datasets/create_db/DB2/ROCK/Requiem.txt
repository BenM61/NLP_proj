Amen, Amen.
It's over
We've come to the end now
Over
I'm sorry to see love die.
It's over
Let's try to stay friends now
Over
We just couldn't live a lie.	

For the promises that we would stay together
Requiem
We were living in a world of never
Never
Nothing
Nothing is for ever
This is a Requiem. Requiem
Requiem.

This is in memory of a million chances
Baby we've had our share.
This could have been one of the great romances
Not just a mad affair.
I still have my souvenirs of special places
And I'll remember them.
But our game is over and we've played our aces
This is a wreck, oh what a wreck, this a Requiem.
Amen.

It's over
And there's nothing to say now
Over
The magic is finally gone.
It's over
There's no other way now
Over
It just can't go on and on.

Now the time has really come to give up trying
Requiem
And to finish with the cheating and the lying
It's doomed
It's damned
It's dying

This is a Requiem, Requiem, Requiem.
This is in memory of a million chances
