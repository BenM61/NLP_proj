Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
I love you in every way
Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
My love grows stronger everyday, yeah

Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
I love you in every way
(Sugar dumpling)
Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
My love grows stronger everyday
(Everyday)

Listen, while I tell you a story
A story about my girl
I call her sugar dumpling
Because she's the sweetest thing
In this whole world

Oh, whenever I'm feeling bad
Right away she puts me to bed
And she hires two nurses
One to hold my hand
The other one to rub my head

Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
I love you in every way
(Sugar dumpling)
Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
My love grows stronger everyday
(Everyday)

Oh, whenever I tell her, honey I'm hungry
Now go and fix me something to eat
This girl rushes in the kitchen
And fixes me a dinner
With seven different kinds of meat

If I call her up at two o'clock in the morning
And say, come on over if you can
Before I hang up the telephone
She's sitting beside me
With a cup of coffee in her hand, oh

Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
I love you in every way
(Sugar dumpling)
Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
My love grows stronger everyday
(Sugar dumpling)

Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
I love you in every way
(Sugar dumpling)
I love you, sugar dumpling
My love grows stronger everyday
(Sugar dumpling)

Oh sugar dumpling, I love you in every way
(Sugar dumpling)
Sugar dumpling, my love grows stronger everyday
(Sugar dumpling)
