When he's dancin', baby
Knows just how to move

When he's in a jam
He knows just what to do

He's talking', baby
Knows just what to say

Think what you want
He don't care anyway

But,
Something is missing
Mr. Big
Something is missing
Mr. Big

You can see him, yeah
He's always on the town

And he's dressed to kill
He always looks so fine

When he wants to walk
He'll walk all over you

But,
Something is missing
Mr. Big
So what's the problem
Mr. Big
Don't look so happy
Mr. Big
Something is missing
Mr. Big

When he's dancin', baby
Knows just how to move

When he's in a jam
He knows just what to do

When he wants to walk
He'll walk all over you

He don't do the things
That little people do

But,
Something is missing
Mr. Big
So what's the problem
Mr. Big
Don't look so happy
Mr. Big
Something is missing
Mr. Big
