Came upon the oaks
Told them about the episode
I didn't want to find
All the things I was looking for

Came upon the oaks
Told them about the episode
Another hero's gone
Another one to tear you up

Another plan to occupy
With no rewards and no reply
When you're down and out of heart
And you can feel the answers hiding
Another one to shake you up
Another one so hard to find
But when it all gets real
All I want is you

They talked about being strong
Then waited on to rip you off
Another ruse gone
Another one to shake you up

Another plan to occupy
With no rewards and no reply
When you're down and out of heart
And you can feel the answers hiding
Another one to shake you up
Another one so hard to find
'Cause when it all hits you
When you've climbed that hill
When it all gets real
All I want is you
