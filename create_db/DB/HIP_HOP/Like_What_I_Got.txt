[Chorus: x2]
I pull out the drop get money on the block bustas wanna hate cause they
Like what I got, like what I got, like what I got, like what I got, like what I got

[Verse 1:]
I guess they like the way I roll on the phantom rolls 
On 24's or the candy slab with the top drop (or maybe they see 4's pokin' out) 
If I'm the car, I'ma star
O G by the pound wit a brown a bar
Got X and weed got what you need
If you got the feed holla at ya boi
Hatas hate cause I'm lookin' great
Cant get what I got so they tend to hate 
I pull out from da parkin' lot drop da top and show Texas plates 
I said... Hatas hate cause I'm lookin' great
Cant get what I got so they tend to hate 
I pull out from da parkin' lot drop da top and show Texas plates
H-town thats what I claim, 84's thats what I swang
I took a mill out my bank account and used dat for my panky rang
H-town thats what I claim, 84's thats what I swang
I took a mill out my bank account and used dat for my panky rang

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 2:]
I drink purple stuff in dat white cup
Jewelry on so I'm iced up 
Shinin' harder than boulevard I see why they don't like us
Candy cars thats all I flip my mowheel grain thats all I grip
I roll a lounge as many cross it so when I hit the strip I don't even trip 
In da streets switchin' lane to lane in da club I'ma make it rain 
Since 24 been da Ceo, us ice age we runnin thangs I said... 
In da streets switchin' lane to lane in da club I'ma make it rain
Since 24 been da ceo, us ice age we runnin' thangs 
I hauld the lane in my candy ride wit a pretty chick on the passenga side I pull out 745 wit a 45 45 I hauld the lane in my candy ride wit a pretty chick on the passenga side (I pull out 745 wit a 45 4545)
