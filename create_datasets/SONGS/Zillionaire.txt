I gotta ask where you been hiding
You're like a twenty karat diamond
The finer things in life were shining
How 'bout that late night wine and dining?

You want that expensive clutch
And I'mma give that five-star experience
Yeah, show you the kinda love
That you can only get when you get the love

I spend it all on you, baby baby, just watch
A BMW, a Bugatti, thick rock
Get you a fancy act any chance I got
When I become a zillionaire
I'll spend it all on shoes for you, take your own pick
McQueen or Jimmy Choo and I'll get 'em real quick
Get you a fancy act any chance I got
When I become a zillionaire

I'm gonna work it to impress you
Get you that dress and then undress you
Oh, we'll do things only the best do
Do what you want because I'll let you

You want that expensive clutch
And I'mma give that five-star experience

I hope you can handle
Living this lavish
Let's blow a zillion, zillion, baby
If you got a passion for fashion
Mansions and platinum
I got the answers to questions
So let me tell you what's happening, baby (what's happening, baby)

I spend it all on you, baby baby, just watch
A BMW, a Bugatti, thick rock
