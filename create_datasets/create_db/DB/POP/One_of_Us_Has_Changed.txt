And when I said to you, but I don't remember when,
How many times I want to run away with you.
And now I'm feeling like it, it will not come again.
And to anybody else, we might seem the same,
Or maybe it's just me, but one of us has changed... 

One of us has changed, I'm sorry I must say,
The difference that it's made is really quite amazing, I,
I wanna live this life, I wanna see the world,
But you can't see past the fact I don't belong to you,
Something's not the same, cause one of us has changed.

And now I'm seeing you, your reflection in the glass.
When I'm watching you, I wonder how long we will last.
And the season's changing, but I think the summer's past.
And to anybody else, we might seem the same, 
Or maybe it's just me, But one of us has changed...


And to anybody else, we might seem the same.
Maybe it's just me.
And to anybody else, we might seem the same, 
Maybe it's just me, but one of us has changed.
