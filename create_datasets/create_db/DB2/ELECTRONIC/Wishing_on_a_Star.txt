I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream
To follow what it means

I'm wishin' on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream
To follow what it means

And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
And I'm wishin' on tomorrow praying he will come
And I'm wishing on all the loving we've ever done

I never thought I'd see
A time when you would be
So far away from home
So far away from me

Just think of all the moments that we've spent
I just can't let you go for me, you were meant
And I didn't mean to hurt you but I know
That in the game of love, you reap what you sow

I feel it's time we should make up, baby
I feel it's time for us to get back together
Make the best of things
Oh baby, when we're together

I feel it's time we should make up, baby
I feel it's time for us to get back together
And make the best of things
Oh baby, when we're together forever and ever, never

I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishin' on a dream
To follow what it means

And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
And I wish on all the people we've ever been
And I'm hoping on all the days to come and to go
And I'm hoping on all days of lovin' you so

I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishin' on a dream
To follow what it means

And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
And I wish on all the people we've ever been
And I'm hoping on all the days to come and to go
And I'm hoping on all days of loving you so

Wishin' on a star
Follow where you are, yes I am
I'm wishin' on a star
Follow where you are

I'm wishin'
I'm wishin'
I'm wishin'
I'm wishin' on a star, yeah

Yeah, I'm wishin'
I'm wishin' on the people who really dream
I'm wishin'
Wishin' on a star
To follow where you are
