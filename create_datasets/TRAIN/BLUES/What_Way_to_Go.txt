I've got to find my baby, I don't know what way to go
Yes, I've got to find my baby, I don't know what way to go
Yes, She don't believe that I love her, I've to find her so I can tell her so

She said that she loved me, people, she didn't want nobody else
Yes, my baby said she loved me, people, she didn't want nobody else
Well, you know I love that woman, people, better than I do myself

Baby, if you can hear my voice, please don't run away from me
Baby, if you can hear my voice, please don't run away from me
'Cause I mean every word I say, baby, I just can't hold on another day

Yes, if you love ever strike you, baby, sit down and write me a line or two
Yes, if you ever, if you ever, if you ever think about me, baby, sit down and write me a line or two
Yes, I wanna see you so bad now, woman, babe I don't know what to do
