Too fast, too odious, too strong
Too slick, too hard to get along
Too weird - don't know where you belong

Too much, too right up in your face
Too heavy, get off of my case
So sad I'll put you in you place

Get ready for this...

[chorus:]
Keep on running
Catch me if you can
Keep on running
Catch me if you can

Too dizzy, too much junk TV
Too busy living through a screen
Don't ever question what you see

Totally absolutely numb
Together till the job is done
What if tomorrow never comes?

Are you ready for this?

[chorus:]
Keep on running
Catch me if you can
Keep on running
Catch me if you can

[bridge:]
Too soon, to easy to give in
Just gotta trust what's within
So can you feel me crawling under your skin

So catch me if you can!

[chorus:] [2x]
Keep on running
Catch me if you can
Keep on running
Catch me if you can
