I don't know how
But I know I'll make it over
Don't know when
But he said he'll bring me through
Not yet there but I can see my destination
Ernest prayer is to be right here with you

But in the meantime
I'll keep on loving
In the meantime
I'm gonna keep on loving you
In the meantime
On this side of heaven
In the meantime
I'm gonna keep on loving you
Love me forever
I just don't want to be lonely

You taught me how
How to love all my brothers
And you given me
A certain job that I must do
Won't be long until that day of celebration
Sing my song
A song of joy when I'm with you

But in the meantime
I'll keep on loving
In the meantime
I'm gonna keep on loving you
In the meantime
On this side of heaven
In the meantime
I'm gonna keep on loving you
Love me forever
I just don't want to be lonely
