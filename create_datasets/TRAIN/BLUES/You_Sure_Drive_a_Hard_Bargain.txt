I walked into your store
Just to have a look around
Asked if you could help me
With the bargain I had found

Tried to explain to you, darlin'
That I was just a working man
You came up with some term
That I could not understand

Oh, little lady
You sure drive a hard bargain
The price you're asking, mama
Is too much for me to pay
Now you're trying to tell me
I can't have it lay away

I know that your merchandise is good
Because your sample proved it so
And if it was to kill me, little girl
Oh, what a good way to go
