I remember when, as a child, 
I used to stop and stare 
Looking in the sky, wondering 
How, did my life compare 

So I found through my desire 
I could take it to the sky--baby 
Now, my heart can fly 

Time moved on and then 
Life and I became the best of friends 
There's no limit to 
All the smiles in life, that's in store for you 

So I found through my desire 
I could take it to the sky--Baby 
Now, my heart can fly 

Life is a word, you live 
Strong as the vibes, you give 
Living in happiness, is knowing 
That you've been blessed 
Learning to fly, it seems 
Is learning to live your dreams 

Take it to the sky 
Learn the reason why, Baby 
Then your heart can fly
