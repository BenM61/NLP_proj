Have you seen the book today 
It's full of lies again 
Your name stands out so clear 
The signature is there 
It's always true 
This book they write for you 

They'll never let you be yourself today 

Have you seen the book today 
It'll be the same tomorrow 
Yesterday I stole a look 
It always seems the same 
It's always true 
This book they write for you 

They'll never let you be yourself today 

The page they're on is never clear 
Teaching all the way 
Chapter 12 is quite sincere 
Even though it's yesterday 

It's always true 
It's always true 
It's always true 
This book they write for you 
It's always true 
This book they write for you 

They'll never let you be yourself today
