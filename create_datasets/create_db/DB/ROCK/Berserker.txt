(I've been waiting for you
Do you want to come
Do you want to come
Do you want to come with me now)

And this is my story
My face, the picture's changed
Do you remember me?
Now I'm fighting to breathe
It's been such a long time

Do you want to come
Do you want to come
Do you want to come with me
Do you want to come
Do you want to come
Do you want to come with me now?

Nothing here for me now
I can't believe the noise
We'll take this place apart
I won't be here for long
I know they'll find me soon

Do you want to come
Do you want to come
Do you want to come with me
Do you want to come
Do you want to come
Do you want to come now?

(I'll question everything
I'll trade new dreams for old)

I'll question everything
I'll trade new dreams for old
I've been waiting for you
I've waited far too long

Do you want to come
Do you want to come
Do you want to come with me
Do you want to come
Do you want to come
Do you want to come now?

(I've been waiting for you
I've waited far too long)
