Oh, ho
How would you like to be
Down by the Seine with me
Oh, what I'd give for a moment or two
Under the bridges of Paris with you

Darling, I'd hold you tight
Far from the eyes of night
Under the bridges of Paris with you
I'd make your dreams come true

How would you like to be
Down by the Seine with me
Oh, what I'd give for a moment or two
Under the bridges of Paris with you

Darling, I'd hold you tight
Far from the eyes of night
Under the bridges of Paris with you
I'd make your dreams come true
