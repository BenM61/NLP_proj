I should've crossed the street
I should've looked away
I should've said a prayer
Instead of saying your name

It's too late to run
I let you get to close
Been here before
But let's see how far this train wreck goes

My hands start shaking 
When yours start moving
My heart couldn't beat any faster
When it comes to taking me
Places I shouldn't be
You're the master
I'm flirting with disaster

Last time I fell for you
Last time I played with fire
I barely made it through
The smoke of that desire

My hands start shaking 
When yours start moving
My heart couldn't beat any faster
When it comes to taking me
Places I shouldn't be
You're the master
I'm flirting with disaster

I can't help myself
Boy you know me well
When I'm this kind of lonely 
You can always tell

My hands start shaking 
When yours start moving
My heart couldn't beat any faster
When it comes to taking me
Places I shouldn't be
You're the master
Ooooh
My hands start shaking 
When yours start moving
My heart couldn't beat any faster
When it comes to taking me
Places I shouldn't be
You're the master
Oh you're the master
I'm flirting with disaster
Flirting with disaster
