The nerves are sending shimmering signals
All through my fingers, the veins support
Blood that gushes impulsively towards

The triumph of a heart that gives all, that gives all
The triumph of a heart that gives all, that gives all

The stubborn trunks of these legs of mine
Serve as pathways for my favorite fuel
Heading upwards towards my kidneys

The triumph of a heart that gives all, that gives all
The triumph of a heart that gives all, that gives all

Smooth, soft, red, velvety lungs
Are pushing a network of oxygen joyfully
Through a nose, through a mouth but all enjoys, all enjoys

The triumph of a heart that gives all, that gives all
The triumph of a heart that gives all, that gives all
The triumph of a heart that gives all, that gives all
The triumph of a heart that gives all, that gives all
