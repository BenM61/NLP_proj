Enter newborn players and gather
Weigh their innocence
Only the brightest shine
But not forever
Many lights die, many tears rain
When those tears run dry
On a mountain madness day
 
You were just in time
For a foolish deal ... a lover sold
I can't stand another howling day
Inside of this empty skin
 
While the beacons burn a flame
Please return from so far away
 
One life with the devil do I play
For so long el diablo is to blame
 
Oh el diablo, el diablo, won't you sell me back my soul?
Oh el diablo, el diablo, won't you sell me back my soul?
 
Weddings on the wind, will she blow my way?
He can dance and she can sing
She will tear your heart away
While the promise burns a flame
And will you return from so far away?
  
One life with the devil do I play
For so long, el diablo is to blame
One life with the devil do I play
For so long, el diablo is to blame
One life but the devil is in my way
