If this is where it's at
why do i feel colder
every hour of every day
i just want you closer
if i didn't feel a thing
i guess it would be easy
to turn and walk away
and never see you leave me

There's nothing wrong
but somethings
happening I'm falling

You gave me warm sunshine
i say i like the moon
you gave me a rainbow
and i paint it black and blue
and i have cold shoulders
but i still long for your touch
does that make me sentimental too?

This isn't really me
i try to hide my colours
they've been turned to black and white
by so many others

There's nothing wrong
but somethings
happening I'm falling

You gave me warm sunshine
i say i like the moon
you gave me a rainbow
and i paint it black and blue
and i have cold shoulders
but i still long for your touch
does that make me sentimental too?

I see your smile it's alright
i won't run away not this time
your too good to loose
so i guess its true 
i must be sentimental too
for you

I guess that makes me sentimental too
