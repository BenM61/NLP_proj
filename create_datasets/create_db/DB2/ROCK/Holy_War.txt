Die for Christ, die for Allah, die for Jerusalem, die for Torah

Father and son marching in rhythm
Firing bullets through the skulls of the children

Holy war, mortars and martyrs
Holy war, unholy followers
Holy war, brainwashed with death
Holy war, unholy mess

I reject the laws of the misguided
False prophets imprison nations fueling self annihilation

I reject pocket lined political demons
Who arm the ignorant for election season

Empires buried in sand
A history of the failures in man

Armies of guardians, servants of bibles
Reciting verses as they stand before rifles

Millions of lives erased
Hatred marked as madness
Violence in leaves of scripture
A world aflame with malice

We will all die for nothing
There is silence in the house of God
There is only the cry of hell
There is silence in the house of God
There is only the cry of hell

Holy war, mortars and martyrs
Holy war, unholy followers
Holy war, brainwashed with death
Holy war, unholy mess

Die for Christ, die for Allah, die for Jerusalem, die for Torah

Father and son marching in rhythm
Firing bullets through the skulls of the children

Holy war, holy war
We will all die for nothing
We will all die for nothing
