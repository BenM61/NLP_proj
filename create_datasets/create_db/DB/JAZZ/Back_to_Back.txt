Dancing back to back 
Takes you off the beaten track 
You don't look at your partner at all 
When you dance back to back 

That's that new attack 
That the other dances lack 
You can see what goes on in the hall 
When you dance back to back... 

Your partner won't see you make eyes at who dances by 
Your partner, oh my dear, he's doing the same, 
that's why you must dance back to back, 
Let me place you in the pack 

Cut the cards and I?ll deal you a queen and a jack 
Back to back!
