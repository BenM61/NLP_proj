I think I like you
Is it too late to change

I think I'd like to
Try to change my ways now
But when the facts are in the game
Just isn't kind alright

As our instincts take shape
It clouds our judgment
And makes the wrong road feel safe

But when the facts are in the game
Just isn't kind alright

Can you answer now?
I wish you'd try

Can you answer now?
Can you answer now?
I wish you'd try

I think I like you
Is it too late to change
I think I'd like to
Try to change my ways now

But when the facts are in the game
Just isn't kind alright

Can you answer now?
Can you answer now?
I wish you'd try
