Don't be blind 
In all the fated life. 
Something great is happening in your life 
But all the noise 
Is drowning out your voice. 
No wonder you've been feeling down 
From time to time. 
You know that you'll survive 
The day you realize 
You can't stop day from turning into night 
Hey  you know you're gonna live 
To find another day  
It's just today things ain't so good. 
Get yourself back again  
You've got so much love 
That you can't afford to lose 
Goodbye heartbreak 
Heartbreak 
Don't look for me 
Cause I don't need you now. 
So long heartache 
Heartache 
Don't look for me 
Cause I don't need you now. 
I don't need you now 
I don't need you now 
I don't need you now 
Hey 
I don't need you now 
I don't need you now 
I don't need you now 
Hey. 
Do you remember as a girl, 
You had a picture of the world 
And you'd think about the great things you would find? 
The thing is nine to five
And a struggle to survive 
Ain't exactly what you had in mind. 
But that's the beauty of life, 
It takes a while to find, 
And you can't have things your own way all the time 
Hey, you know you're gonna live 
To find another day, 
It's just today things ain't so good. 
Get yourself back again, 
You've got so much love 
That you can't afford to lose 
Goodbye heartbreak 
Heartbreak 
Don't look for me 
Cause I don't need you now. 
So long heartache 
Heartache 
Don't look for me 
Cause I don't need you now. 
I don't need you now 
I don't need you now 
I don't need you now 
Hey 
I don't need you now 
I don't need you now 
I don't need you now 
Hey. 
Goodbye heartbreak 
Heartbreak 
Don't look for me 
Cause I don't need you now. 
So long heartache 
Heartache 
Don't look for me 
Cause I don't need you now. 
I don't need you now 
I don't need you now
