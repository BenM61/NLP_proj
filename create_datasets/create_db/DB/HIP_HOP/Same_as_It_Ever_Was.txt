Uh shoot 'em all baby
Just call it in one time for me real heavy
Back in black
Who's the mack
Sittin' on the back
Of a Cadillac
It's the D motherfucker
Better pass me the mic
So I can rock on
And drop the styles I write
I like hip-hop
Ya don't stop
And all that
I rock the freak styles
And neat styles
That are crazy fat
It's making me sick
Punk get off my dick

chorus

'Cause I'm the same motherfucker
That I ever was
Same motherfucker
But I can't pay attention
'Cause I'm on that dust

My head's not swell
Kid I'm not sell
Don't feed me soup
Just give me the funky loop
I'll rock it to the best of my ability
Runnin' mad styles and showin' flexibility
'Cause I'm the man that's on point
When I jam a funky joint
I want some other over there
Yo, I just don't care shit
Pass the mic
Then I'm gonna' tear shit
Up like a piece of paper
Your girl caught the vapor
When I ran the caper
I ain't rearranged
So don't look strange
I'm the same motherfucker
Ain't a damn thing changed

chorus

'Cause I'm hard like stone
Don't play me soft
And I rock rhymes frequently
I drop it off and
I'm off in space
I remember your face
But don't remember your name
'Cause it's all the same
As it ever was
That's what it is money grip
Don't trip
Or I'm gonna' bust that lip

chorus

Bust it, flip it, skip it
Just like a stone on a river
Ya know I'm gonna' give her
Whole lotta' flavor
Criminal behavior
Used to be how I made it
But that shit's over rated
Now I rock rhymes over funky beats
I f*ck fine hookers between satin sheets
They say money changes people
But I won't 'cause
I'm the same motherfucker that I ever was

chorus

And ya don't quit
'Cause I'm on that dust
Soul assassins are on that dust[ha ha...]
My man J. Disco is on that dust
Cypress Hill is on that dust
FunkDoobiest is on that dust
