Baby I ain't going down, that road of love by myself
No, no I ain't going down, that road of love by myself
Now if you won't go with me baby
I guess I'll just have to get somebody else

Oh darling, I hope you feel the same way too
Baby, I sure hope you feel the same way too
Cause as long as we have each other
I'll have your love to see me through now
And ohh baby, let's walk together hand in hand
Ohh baby, baby, baby, let's walk together hand in hand, oh lord
And you can be my little woman now
And I know I know I'm gonna be your man
What I think now
I like what I'm listening to right now
Oh baby let's walk together hand in hand
Oh oh oh baby let's walk together hand in hand
And you can be my little woman
I know I know I'm gonna be your man
Don't make me walk by myself baby
I just don't walk by myself now now now baby
Ohhh baby, I ain't going down the road by myself
Oh no, now if you won't go with me darling
I guess I'll have to get somebody else
Ohh baby, don't leave me, stay with me
Take care of me baby, ohh baby
