every single day 
on the same old street
we pass each other buy
but our eyes never seem to meet
you never take your gaze off of the ground
well here is a little something
that'll turn your head around
i've been watching you buddy for a long long time
i know all your twisted thoughts 
because i can read your little mind

you're a perverted evil menace to society
that's why the world is so lucky to have people like me
who can see that your life has very little worth
and you shall now be removed from the face of the earth

so i'll come to see you and you won't know when
i'll send you to someplace you've never been

sample: too bad you're gonna die now"
sample: "are you ready?"

your whole world revolves around a big fat lie
well maybe that's why we never seem to see eye to eye
you're completely absorbed in your stupid self
you'll find maybe that's not so good for your health
'cause when you are heading your little crib
with your usual empty mind
i'll be tiptoeing right along about three steps behind

you won't see me 
you won't hear me
you won't know that i'm there
and as you look over your stupid shoulder
i disappear into thin air

yeah you think you are safe in your nice suburban home
with your nice suburban car with your cute little mobile phone
i see you called your girlfriend
to ask her for a date
too bad I already paid her a visit
Heh Heh Heh Heh Heh Heh Heh Heh

sample: "to bad you're gonna die now"
sample: "hear we go"
sample: "supression" (star trek?)

yeah i come to your house when your asleep
into your broken window i creep
your bedroom light on
comes into the shade the flickering shadow
of a nine inch blade
i feel my way to your bedroom door
where i glide like a cat across your bedroom floor

the knife comes to rest up under your chin
where it gently careeses the tender skin
you think you're still dreaming when you open your eyes
then you suddenly wake up and feel my steel surprise
and i say "hi, i'm mc nine oh oh"
"how ya doin'?"
"its too bad you're gonna die"

sample: "its too bad your gonna die now"
