I'm feeling all this pressure and I'm trying to breathe
It's in the way you touch me and you're making me weak
Knocking down my walls, you got me down and so deep
So deep, so deep, so deep, so deep
Yeah, I'm caught up in confusion, you're too blurry to see
Cause this manic situation's getting harder to read
The waves are crashing over but I'm crashing right in
Yeah, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in

Drowning in your ocean
Swimming in a motion

You're making me sweat and I'm over my head
You're making me sweat, oh, swimming in a motion
You're making me sweat
You're making me sweat

We could do whatever, I don't even care what
Minutes turn to hours, got me gasping for air
Always dreamed of this, but now you're taking me there
Yeah, we're there, we're there, we're there, we're there
I could stay right here forever, feeling reckless and free
As long as we're together, I got all that I need
The tides are rolling over, but we're rolling right in
Yeah, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in

Drowning in your ocean
Swimming in a motion

You're making me sweat and I'm over my head
You're making me sweat, oh, swimming in a motion
You're making me sweat
You're making me sweat
You're making me sweat
Drowning in your ocean
Swimming in a motion

You're making me sweat and I'm over my head
You're making me sweat, swimming in a motion
You're making me sweat and I'm over my head
You're making me sweat, swimming in a motion
You're making me sweat, oh, you're making me sweat
Yeah, you're making me sweat
Oh, swimming in a motion
You're making me sweat
You're making me sweat
