Don't trust in me she said
I'll always lie to you
That way you'll never know
Just where you stand

I'll soothe your loneliness
Until it's time to go
And you need never know
Just where you stand

I know all there is to know
On how a dream gets shattered
And you know all you need to know
One more bleeding heart won't matter now

Don't tell me baby
Don't tell me how
How you love me
Things can never be the same
'Cause a part of me will still remain

In Tularosa, In Tularosa

In times of solitude
I won't remember you
That way you'll never know
Just where you stand

And I don't need your sympathy
Your food upon my table

and no-one watching over me
You won't rock my baby's cradle, now

Don't tell me baby
Don't tell me how
How you love me
Things can never be the same
'Cause a part of me will still remain

In Tularosa, In Tularosa

And I don't need your sympathy
Your food upon my table
and no-one watching over me
You won't rock my baby's cradle, now

Don't tell me baby
Don't tell me how
How you love me
Things are never gonna change
And a part of me will still remain

In Tularosa, In Tularosa

I won't remember you
You'll soon forget about me too
My heart belongs somewhere else...
My baby's calling, my baby's calling...
