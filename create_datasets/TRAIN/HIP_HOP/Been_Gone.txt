I know its late baby 
I've been dialing your number all day, 
Got me missin' you like crazy 
You actin' like you hate me 
Yes I know I was wrong I just want you back 
Just say you'll take me 
It just can't be over 
You took away your phone calls and kisses, 
I thought that we were closer 
You're givin' me the could shoulder 
When I want your warm hugs and kisses 
That's what I need the most 

It's like Bonnie with no Clyde without you by my side 
It's like a part of me died away 
Since you been gone 
If I spend some time without you thought I'd be okay 
I can't replace you, I tried, it didn't work out that way 
So tell me where will you go, 
And tell me who's gonna love you like I do 
Since you been gone 
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone 
Since you been gone 

I can't respect your feelings 
So tell me when you thought about it, 
Did you think of me at all 
You don't seem to be affected 
I'm tryin' to correct it 
You shoot me down, how could you watch me fall 
I make mistakes that don't mean that I don't love you 
I'll learn to love you more, whatever, just let me know 
I feel so empty 'cause you've taken your love out my life 
I'll keep you happy darling don't let me go 

It's like Bonnie with no Clyde without you by my side 
It's like a part of me died away 
Since you been gone 
If I spend some time without you thought I'd be okay 
I can't replace you, I tried, it didn't work out that way 
So tell me where will you go, 
And tell me who's gonna love you like I do 
Since you been gone 
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone 
Since you been gone 

This time I'll say I love you every time we speak, 
Make you a priority, be your strength when you are
Weak 
This time whenever you call me I'll be there, 
No matter what I'm doin' I will come no matter where 
This time I'll give you all the lovin' that I got, 
Say the right things,
I don't wanna lose what I got 
And I don't wanna hurt no more, 
But you got down baby open up the door and let me in 

It's like Bonnie with no Clyde without you by my side 
It's like a part of me died away 
Since you been gone 
If I spend some time without you thought I'd be okay 
I can't replace you, I tried, it didn't work out that way 
So tell me where will you go, 
And tell me who's gonna love you like I do 
Since you been gone 
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone 
Since you been gone
