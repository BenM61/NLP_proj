When I'm feelin' low
These are my choice notes
When I'm down on the floor
I shake it for your holy ghost
And I sip it off, I sip it off
I spit it out, it sounds real nice
I sip it off I sip it off
I spit it out, I'm satisfied

Oh Jameson
You should be weighing on my soul now
But I turn the music loud
Get ready to go

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
These are my choice notes
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Its 3: 45 and I'm still on a roll
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
These are my choice notes
Its 3: 45 and I'm still on a roll

And what you don't know
Cant slow my tempo
Though you beat at my bones
Won't catch me singing sad prose
And I sip it off, I sip it off
I spit it out, it sounds real nice
I sip it off I sip it off
I spit it out, I'm satisfied

Oh Jameson
You should be weighing on my soul now
But I turn the music loud
Get ready to go

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
These are my choice notes
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Its 3: 45 and I'm still on a roll
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
These are my choice notes
Its 3: 45 and I'm still on a roll
