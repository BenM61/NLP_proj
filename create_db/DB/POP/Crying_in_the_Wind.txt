La la la

Crying in the wind
As a teardrop flies
Into the still of the night
Out of my tear shed eyes
Crying in the wind

Crying because you're gone
Alone I walk in the still of the night
Wond'ring what I've done wrong
Crying in the wind
Weary as I go
Heavy is my heart
As the night winds blow
Crying in the wind
As a teardrop flies 
Into the still of the night
Why did you say "Goodbye"?
