"There is goes it goes with her. 
It doesn't leave so easily. 
There is goes it goes with him. 
It never leaves so easily. 

And thoughts come and thoughts go. 
Tear people apart who don't know. 
And its just a notion that comes to me. 
Here it comes it comes to her. 

It doesn't leave so easliy. 
Here it comes it comes to him it never leaves so easily. 
And thoughts come and thoughts go tear people apart who don't know. 
It's just a notion that comes to me*
