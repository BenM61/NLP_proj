Original Pirate Material 
Yer listening to the streets 
Lock down your aerial 
Make yerself at home 
We got diesel or some of that homegrown 
Sit back in yer throne, turn off yer phone 
'Cause this is our zone 
Videos, televisions, 64's Playstations 
We're paring with precision 
Few herbs and a bit of Benson 
But don't forger the Rizla, 
Lean like the Tower of Pisa 
Liza, I'll raise yer, 
And this is the day in the life of a Geezer 
For this ain't a club track 
Pull out yer sack and sit back 
Whether you white or black 
Smoke weed, chase brown 
Or toot rock 
We're on a mission, support the cause 
Sign a petition, summon all your wisdom 
The music's a gift from the Man on high 
The Lord and his children 
Triple teen year rudeboys 
Come rain or snow the boodah flows 
You don't know? 
Stand on the corner watch the show 
'Cause life moves slow 
Sort yer shit out then roll 
Sex, drugs 'n' on the Dole 
Some men rise, some men fall 
I hear ya call, stand tall now 
Has it come to this?

Your listening to the streets 
Lock down your aerial 
I'm just spitting, think I'm ghetto? 
Stop dreaming, my data's streaming 
I'm giving your bird them feelings 
Touch yer toes and touch the ceiling 
We walk the tightrope of street cred 
Keep my dogs fed, all jungle all garage heads 
Gold teeth, Valentinos and dreads 
Now, we were verbally slapped up 
Physically tip-top, spinally ripped up 
I do the science on my laptop, get my boys mashed up 
Your listening to The Streets 
You'll bear witness to some amazing feats 
Bravery in the face of defeat 
All line up and grab yer seat 
'Cause Tony's got a new motor 
SR Nova driving like a joyrider 
Speeding to the corner 
Yer mother warned yer to sound system banger 
Has it come to this?

Your listening to The Streets 
Lock down your aerial 
My underground train runs from Mile End to Ealing 
From Brixton to Boundsgreen 
My spitting's dirty my beats are clean 
So smoke weed and be lean 
I step out my yard through the streets 
In the dead heat all I got's my spirit and my beats 
I play fair don't cheat 
And keep the gangsters sweet 
Turn the page, don't rip it out at yer age 
Move to the next stage 
Lock the rage inside the cage, 
Like SK it's New Day 
But don't take the shortcut through the subway 
It's pay or play, these geezers walk the gangway 
Deep seated urban decay, deep seated urban decay, 
Rip down posters alight 
From last weeks big Garage night 
And the next Tyson fight 
I cook 'em at ninety degrees Fahrenheit 
And don't copy the copyright 
I got em in my sites, blinding with the lights 
Taken to dizzy new heights 
Blinding with the lights, blinding with the lights 
Dizzy new heights 
Has It come to this?
