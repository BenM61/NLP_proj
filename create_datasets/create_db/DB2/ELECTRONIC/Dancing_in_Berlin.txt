Stop, now let's go again
Go, don't stop again
No, I don't want to be alone

Yes, it's a time for fun
Dance, til the night is done
Look, it's a motion picture show

Dancing in Berlin
I want to see you
Dancing in Berlin

East, such a mystery
West, open history
You, just a moment flashing by

Look, see I'm just like you
Hey, can't you see it's true 
Touch, and you'll feel the answer too

Reach, for your politics
Fire, propaganda tricks
Stop, just look at me again

One, there's no time for this
Two, grant me just one wish
Please, there's no wall in front of you
