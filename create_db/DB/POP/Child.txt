Sleep peacefully now, my child.
I hope that you go away,
To a place, where your dreams can play.
Wipe all the tears from your eyes.
There is a sky of blue.
This is your time of truth.

Like a bird, high on the wind
May you fly away.
Like a snowfall in the spring,
May you cares melt away.
Child, innocent child.
Our hope lies inside
Your starry eyes,
My innocent child.

Hero, now that you are free,
You have no need to fear.
So go out and find your smile,
Like a candle in the stream.
May you float away
Like a feather on the breeze,
May you blow away.

[Chorus]
Like a candle.
Like a snowfall.
Like a feather.
Like a bird - fly away.
Like a candle
Like a snowfall
Like a feather
Like a bird - fly away.

[Chorus]

Sleep peacefully now, my child.
I hope that you go away
To a place, where you dreams can play.
