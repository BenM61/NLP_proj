She's young and soft and kind
And she deserves a whole lot better
Than a guitar pickin' drifter
Who never gave a tinkers damn
But if lovin' me is what she really wants
I'm gonna let her and I'll do my best
To try and be the man she thinks I am
She makes these little kitten sounds
And trembles when I love her
Makes me feel so big and strong and mean
Whispers that she cannot wait
To be my baby's mother
She's the only glimpse of God I've ever seen
Her momma should have warned her
Never take up with a poet
'Cause a poet travels rocky roads
In search of truth and light
I'm the only blemish on her virgin soul
She don't even know it and I
Thank the Lord she's lyin' gentle 
By my side tonight
