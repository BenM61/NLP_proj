Girl the first time we met 
You took me by surprise 
Girl you walked into my life 
With those street corner blues 

You were living in the fast lane 
Much to my surprise baby 
But I feel for you anyway 
I'm addicted to your love girl 

[Chorus]
Stone love 
Solid as a rock 
I'm in love with you baby 
Stone love 
Solid as a rock 

Girl our love is so unique 
It's one of a kind 
And girl when ever we kiss 
It's like a natural high 

But we're living in the fast lane 
Red lights flashing baby 
Will we ever change 
The way we are stone love girl 

[Chorus]

The life we live is a challenge 
Always standing on the edge 

May not be the best way but that's all we know 
'Cause I don't want to live my life alone no no 

[Chorus]

May not be the best way but that's all we know 
'Cause I don't want to live my life alone no no 

Oh love you're my love 
You're my everything I've ever wanted baby 
yeah yeah now talking about stone love now 
You and me baby
