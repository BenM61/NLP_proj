And love I've been waiting
'Cause I just want to cause a big thing
Don't tell me you missed me
I've been working on my aim
Oh I tried, so we can both be nice
But now I'm stuck here with bad thoughts in death scenes
But I'll be fine just as long as you know

You should be my lover

And love I've been planning
But I don't want to give it away
'Cause I break like a bad dam
When I'm not careful what I say (and I never am)
This wouldn't be so hard if it wasn't so overdue
Now I'm not sure we're left with an option
If it's a matter of me and you

You could be my lover, if you want me tonight
You should be my lover, come and pull me inside
Or come on out and find me
And let me know it's alright
You could be my lover
You should be my lover

Fill the room with glass and sand
Saw your list of one demand
It read so clean across your eyes
I only wish you could have lied
And stopped your heart eventually
From falling out so close to me

You could be my lover, if you want me tonight
You should be my lover, come and pull me inside
Or come on out and find me
And let me know it's alright
You could be my lover
You should be my lover
