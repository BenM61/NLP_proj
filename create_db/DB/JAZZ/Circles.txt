When you were languishing in rooms I built to file you in
And when the wind set down in funnel form and pulled you in

I don't need to walk around in circles
Walk around in circles, walk around in circles
Walk around in
Don't need to walk around in circles
Walk around in circles, walk around in circles
Walk around in

And when the ghostly dust of violence traces everything
And when the gas runs out just wreck it, you insured the thing

I don't need to walk around in circles
Walk around in circles, walk around in circles
Walk around in
Don't need to walk around in circles
Walk around in circles, walk around in circles
Walk around in

Doom da doom da doom
Well I'm going, I'm going

Doom da doom da doom
Well I'm going, I'm going

Doom da doom da doom
Well I'm going, I'm going

Doom da doom da doom
Well I'm going, I'm going

But I can't sigh now that you made the move
It has gone and gone to dogs
Lay down on the floor
For the right price I can get everything
Slip into the car
Go driving to the farthest star

I don't need to walk around in circles, walk-a
In circles, walk around in circles
Walk around in-a
Don't need to walk around in circles
Walk around in circles, walk around in circles
Walk around in
Don't need to walk around in circles
Walk around in circles, walk around in circles
Walk around in
