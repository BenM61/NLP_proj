Staring out at the rain with a heavy heart
Its the end of the world in my mind
Then your voice pulls me back
Like a wake-up call

I've been looking for the answer
Somewhere
I couldn't see that it was right there
But now I know, what I didn't know

Because you live and breathe
Because you make me believe in myself
When nobody else can help
Because you live girl
My world
Has twice as many stars in the sky

It's all right.
I survived.
I'm alive again
Cause of you, made it through every storm
What is life? what's the use?
If you're killing time

I'm so glad I found an angel
Someone
Who was there when all my hopes fell
I want to fly looking your eyes

Because you live and breathe
Because you make me believe in myself
When nobody else can help
Because you live girl
My world
Has twice as many stars in the sky

Because you live, I live

Because you live, there's a reason why
I carry on when I lose the fight
I want to give what you've given me
Always

Because you live and breathe
Because you make me believe in myself
When nobody else can help
Because you live girl
My world
Has twice as many stars in the sky

Because you live and breathe
Because you make me believe in myself
When nobody else can help
Because you live girl
My world
Has everything I need to survive
Because you live, I live
I live
