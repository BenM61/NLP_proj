I was paralyzed 
As I opened up my bloodshot eyes 
Do I really want to know 
Where I've been 
Or where I've put my nose 

I'm in a rut 
Keep kicking myself in the nuts 
In a stairwell I seek 
The lair where I stuck my dirty beak 
So I'm back again it's OK 
Well be that as it may 
Over and over away 
Into the fires unknown 
Into oblivion 

Through sticks and stones 
Pick up the phone 
My jacks are all blown 
Oh these nights out alone 
Come carry me home 
A habit hard to break 
Take me home, good lord 
For heaven's sake 

The doctor's not in 
Got no cure for the medicine 
So I'm back again it's OK 
Well be that as it may 
Over and over away 
Into the fires unknown 
Into oblivion 

Through sticks and stones 
Pick up the phone
Listen to me moan 
Oh these nights out alone 
Come carry me home 

Every time I make the round 
I turn around 
I'm put upon the rack 
Every time I stand up 
I fall flat on my face 
And break my back 
Tombstoned and chicken shacked
