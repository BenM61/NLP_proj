First time they've called me a bastard
They even told me to get a proper - haircut -
When I rumble all of them tremble
Because they get to know that I'm a lion
Come and let us rise
Let us rise up so high
Jah people hear my cry...
Let us stay how I can stand
And join ours hands and when I see your smile
Can you see these in the sky 
I sing this dance of dance of joy
'cause so long Babylone I put demon down 
That's why my sing say
First time they've called me a bastard
They even told me to get a proper - haircut -
When I rumble all of them tremble
Because they get to know that I'm a lion
When are the trues getting more realized
Babylon return I get paralyzed 
And as the lion I deh pon the rise 
And the love in ours hearts
We will be down them force
So the conscious and wise 
You know what has been prophetise
And this with this vision depends my mind
All the time all the why and that's where we fly(ing)
I think the sun go far in the sky
I feel your hit you know me about bad feel me
Now look back and there then the sun come rise
And the most beautiful land
Is reveal to my eyes 
I say
First time they've called me a bastard
They even told me to get a proper - haircut -
When I rumble all of them tremble
Because they get to know that I'm a lion
