Here we go
Climbing the stairway to heaven
Here we go
Walking the road of ecstasy

Taking the load
Of this whole world off our shoulders
The door is wide open for you
The door is open for me

Here we go
Still in a moment of pleasure
You and I
We are gonna find the pirates treasure

Here we go
Oh baby
Oh baby, here we go
Climbing the stairway to heaven
Climbing the stairway to heaven

And we are going step by step
Together, step by step

Here we go
Oh baby
Oh baby, here we go
Climbing the stairway to heaven
Climbing the stairway to heaven

And we are going step by step
Together, step by step

Stairway to heaven
Stairway to heaven
Stairway to heaven
Stairway to heaven
Stairway to heaven
Stairway to heaven
For the rest of our life
We are gonna be together
Stairway to heaven
Just me and you
Stairway to heaven
Me and you

Put your hand in my shoulder, lean closer
Don't you wanna go, don't you wanna go, don't you wanna go
We'll go out and we're gonna find it
In our own little corner of the world
Our own little spot (and I wonder), it'll be me and you, come on

Don't you wanna go, don't you wanna go, don't you wanna go
I said, baby, it's gonna be just like goin' on up (heaven)
Sweet life (heaven)
Nice life (heaven)
Heaven

Stealin' a moment, stealin' a moment of pleasure
Don't you wanna go, don't you wanna go, don't you wanna go
Just put your hand in mine
Talkin' 'bout heaven right here on earth
Gonna make it, gonna make it real
Don't you wanna go, don't you wanna go, don't you wanna go
Real easy, easy for you, baby, come on and go with me right now

I said it'll be just right (heaven)
Sweet (heaven)
Nice (heaven)

Heaven's on my mind (heaven)
Goin' on up (heaven)
Goin' on up, it's gon' be just like

Walk with me 
'Cause the door is open
Talk with me
Come on, baby
Love me
Don't you wanna go, don't you wanna go, don't you wanna go
Love me 
Step by step now
Put your hand in mine
For all times
All the troubles in the world, and come on
Don't you wanna go, don't you wanna go, don't you wanna go
Come on, come on, it's gon' be just like, just like (heaven)
It's gonna, it's gonna seem just like (heaven)
'Cause heaven's on my mind (heaven)
I said come on and go, go, go 
Heaven right here on earth (heaven)
Go on, go on (heaven)
