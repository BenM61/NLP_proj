Well look here Jack
There's something down
The track
He's got rhythm in his feet
But nothing in the sack
The boogie woogie Santa Claus
Boogie woogie Santa Claus
Boogie woogie Santa
Comes to town
Every Christmas day

Well he lives up
In a mountain
Like a hermit in the cave
He never had a haircut
He never took a shave
The boogie woogie Santa Claus
Boogie woogie Santa Claus
Boogie woogie Santa
Comes this time
Every Christmas day

Well
It's rock rock rock Mr. Santa
Jump jump jump Mr. Santa
Well the boogie woogie Santa
Will boogie all your blues away

Got no presents for your tree
No Candy for your socks
When he starts to boogie
The whole town rocks

Mama get your hat
Put your best dress on
We're gonna jump for joy
On the Christmas morn
The boogie woogie Santa Claus
Boogie woogie Santa Claus
Boogie woogie Santa Boogie
All your blues away

Well
It's rock rock rock Mr. Santa
Jump jump jump Mr. Santa Claus
Well the boogie woogie Santa
Will boogie all your blues away
