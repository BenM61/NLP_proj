We've got CD's, tapes
And videos, radios and TV shows
Conferences, retreats
And seminars

We've got books and magazines
To read on everything from A to Z
And a web to surf
From anywhere we are

But I hope with all this information
Buzzing through our brains
That we will not let our hearts forget
The most important thing

Is love, love, love, love, love
It's all about love, love, love, love, love
Everything else comes down to this
Nothing any higher on the list than love
It's all about love

Now they're fighting in the Middle East
And they're fighting down on 7th street
And there are fights
In my own house on given days

It's like something's lurking deep inside
That can't seem to be satisfied
But life was not meant
To be lived this way

'Cause it's true for every man
And woman, every boy and girl
That our only hope for living
Here together in this world

Is love, love, love, love, love
It's all about love, love, love, love, love
Everything else comes down to this
Nothing any higher on the list than love

This is the reason we were made
To know the love of our creator
And to give the love He's given us away
Yeah, the Maker and the Father
And the God of everything

He says to love love love
He says love love love
Love love love
'Cause after all it's all about love

God says, love, love, love, love, love
It's all about love, love, love, love, love
Everything else comes down to this
Nothing any higher on the list than love
'Cause after all it's all about love

It's all about love, love, love, love, love
It's all about love, love, love, love, love
It's all about love, love, love, love, love
