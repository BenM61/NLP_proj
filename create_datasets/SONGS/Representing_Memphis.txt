I love it on the Southside
They know how to deep fry
Take it up to Orange Mound
We're representing Memphis

I like it at the Harlem House
Almost good as at my Momma's house
Make it at the Klondike
We're representing Memphis

I grew up there so don't talk about my city
From the hood to the burbs we all stay busy
From the bottom to the top we got it alot
We're representing Memphis
