This is not what you

Throw the day with me
It is alright here, it is alright here
Walk on and wish with me
It's alright here, it is alright

And I will long to be you
Too long, too long to wait for
Pieces don't fit
Aren't fit to be you
It's gone, you're gone, you're gone

This is not what you

Find another way, from me
It's all out there
There's nothing out there

And I will long to be you
Too long, too long to wait for
Pieces don't fit
Aren't fit to reach you
It's gone, you're gone, you're gone

This is not what you
