I leave as I enter, another boy caught in-between
Now all I can muster are whispers to your screams
Don't you remember how you eased my disgrace?
Don't you remember the love you saw in my face?

Perfected in silence
A physical presence

I sought affection, but now I realize
A cold rejection, the movement in your eyes
But I can remember when you shook against me
I can remember when I saw what love could be

Perfected in silence
A physical presence

Ain't what she did, it's the way that she did it
When I couldn't give, only she could forgive it
Ain't what she did, it's the way that she did it
As long as I live, it's for me to relive it
Silence

Part of the answer is that there's really no escape
Part of the answer is that life can have such perfect shape
Don't you remember all the nights you shared in my disgrace?
Don't you remember that the love that filled this empty space 
Was

Perfected in silence?
A physical presence
Perfected in silence
A physical presence
