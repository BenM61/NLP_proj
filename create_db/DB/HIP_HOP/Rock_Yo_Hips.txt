Lil' Jay on the track, nigga
Aye and you already know it's ya boy Lil' Scrappy
We finna have the whole M-F world, rockin' in dis bitch
Look at shawty, check her out
Southern smokin'

I like the way she rock her hips
Then wave and sip
She rock her hips, then wave and sip
She rock her hips, she rock her hips
She rock her hips, then wave and sip

Look at them hips; I like how she rock it
She bend that thing ova and to the ground
She can drop it
And pop it hard as she can; got me hard in da pants
Because she in all her stance
Doing her muthafuckin' dance, man
Look, lil' body, cute in da face
She rock her hips to the bass, then she take a sip
When she wave
And wanna get wit' Lil' Jay
After she dance on dat pole
I pull my can so quick and fast
When dat ass hit da flo'

Now, I got thirty-two flavors of dat Booty-licious bubblegum
Raspberry, grape, cherry
Come and get this, Honey bun
Yummy-yum, baby
Not your ordinary lady
Known to drive a nigga crazy
Willie Wonka wanna pay me on the daily
Off the hizzle, rock my heels, shake my skittles
Soda pop it, watch it sizzle, man
This chick here for shizzle
Smokin' on the highest drizzle
Wanna taste it, just a little
Rock my hips, then make it wiggle
Wavin', sippin' in the bizzle

I like the way she rock her hips
Then wave and sip
She rock her hips, then wave and sip
She rock her hips, she rock her hips
She rock her hips, then wave and sip

I like the way she rock her hips
Then wave and sip
She rock her hips, then wave and sip
She rock her hips, she rock her hips
She rock her hips, then wave and sip

I like it when she show me she can rock it
Roll it, drop it to the flo'
Bouncin' slow, shawties, all pole
That's the way to go
Tell her booey-ooey got a nigga glancin'
Every time that ass react
I thought I saw a puddy cat
Gimmie, gimmie, gimmie that fat cat
Don't act on a pimp
You got me enticed by the way you rock dem hips
You's a trip, girl, doin' all dem tricks
That's what's up
I like dat shit a lot
Come and holla at a thug

A-town's finest, I'm the top-notch glamor chick
Tell me, if I throw it at you, baby, can you handle it?
Pistols causin' rushin', if a hater wanna run dey lip
Step up in da club and have dem whisperin' 'goddamn, she thick.'
Take it to the bar; Hypnotic and Hennessey is on my list
Seductively moving my body; now watch me rock my hips
Take a sip of the goose
I'm lookin' good and livin' lavish
Big boy pimpin', popin', dippin'
Now tell me I'm not tha baddest

I walk in da club and she wobble and shakin'
I wanna take her to the house
So a playa can start breakin'
In her muthafuckin' back, like a playa suppose, goddamn
Lil' body, touch your toes, goddamn
Lil' body, take off yo' clothes
And let me see dat apple bottom and
Dat brown booty hole
Shawty, slide up and down on dat pole
In the V.I.P this how it muthafuckin' go

I like the way she rock her hips
Then wave and sip
She rock her hips, then wave and sip
She rock her hips, she rock her hips
She rock her hips, then wave and sip

I like the way she rock her hips
Then wave and sip
She rock her hips, then wave and sip
She rock her hips, she rock her hips
She rock her hips, then wave and sip
