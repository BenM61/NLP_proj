Get down  get on let down your hair 
There's people dancing everywhere 
Gonna get you in the mood to party all night

Jump in the car and tell your friends 
Checking out some grooves on the way 
Because tonight is the night 
Everything's gonna be alright 
Honey's jumping 'cause you've just got paid

Hey DJ let the record spin 
Everybody get up and shake that thing 
Let the music take you over 
So get down with the town 
You know we don't stop 
When the sun goes down 
Bring it on down to the floor

Everybody knows that the boys will be around
