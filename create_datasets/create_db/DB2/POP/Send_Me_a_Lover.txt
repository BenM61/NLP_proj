I wasn't searching 
To end this hurting 
But out of nowhere 
You made me feel 

I cried about it 
I lied about it 
And tired to doubt 
This could be real 

You've touched me far too much 
I'm letting go of all the pain 
I'm into you in every way 

Send me a lover 
Someone to believe in 
Please send me someone I can hold 
Baby now 
Send me a lover 

A new beginning 
Someone to take away the cold 
And give me back 
What I've been missing 

All the love that lays and waits inside your heart 
It still astounds me 
The way you found me 
It's almost too good 

To be true 
From our first meeting 
I had the feeling 
The rest of my life 

I'd spend with you 
I can't just turn my back 
On everything I've heard you say 
I'm into you in every way 

Send me a lover 
Someone to believe in 
Please send me someone I can hold 
Baby now 
Send me a lover 

I thought that love was only a word 
I'd never feel 
All the passion I hold inside 
Was simply just a dream 
Out of your heart you gave to me 

I know it's real 
And I've fallen 
So in love with you 

Send me a lover 
Someone to believe in 
Please send me someone I can hold 
Baby now 
Send me a lover
