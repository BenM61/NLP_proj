I just wanna take away the pressure
I knew you were special when I met you
Hate the way you bottle your confessions
I wait for you, I gotta know, I gotta know
Who you, who you, are
And you ain't gotta worry when you with me
I vibe with your mental because you get me
And whenever you want me, you can hit me
I'll be there in a minute boy
I'm tryna get close to you, to you, oh oh

Anything you want, I got it
In my feelings, boy, I'm so about you
I just wanna get to know your body
Baby anything goes
When I'm tryna get close to you, to you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh na, na, na
Oh na, na
Oh na, na, na
Na

I just wanna make this a win win baby
So tell me is you out or is you in baby
We might just end up sharing skin babies
Siamese twins baby
I wanna get close to you, oh, woah-oah, oh-oh-oh
Ah, alright, oh
Baby I think we done talked enough
Hit some of this kush and take this cup
Baby I ain't tryna make love
You know that I'm a thug (Tryna f*ck)
So what's up with you?
What's up with you?
All I know, oh girl

Anything you want, I got it
In my feelings, boy, I'm so about you
I just wanna get to know your body
Baby anything goes
When I'm tryna get close to you, to you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh na, na, na
Oh na, na
Oh na, na, na

Said I was through with niggas but I really want him
His swagger got me falling like a leaf in autumn
And I don't give a damn about his baby momma
He always on my mind, I think I'm 'bout to call him
It might not last forever but it speed the healin'
This ain't the same with him, I get a better feeling
Don't care 'bout what they say, it ain't nobody's business
I said I wouldn't fall, I guess you got me slippin'

I'm tryna get close to you, yeah
I'm tryna get close to you, to you, yeah yeah yeah
Oh na, na, na
Oh na, na, na

Anything you want, I got it
In my feelings, boy, I'm so about you
I just wanna get to know your body
Baby anything goes
When I'm tryna get close to you, to you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh na, na, na
Oh na, na, na
Oh na, na, na
Oh, na, na, na
