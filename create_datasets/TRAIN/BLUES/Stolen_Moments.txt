Stolen moments
Stolen moments
If I told you I love you, pretty baby,
Would it make up for what they say?
If I hold you and shield you, darlin',
Will you linger awhile today?
If I hold you and hug you,
My kissin' 
Stolen moments
Stolen moments
If I told you I love you, pretty baby,
Would it make up for what they say?
If I hold you and shield you, darlin',
Will you linger awhile today?
If I hold you and hug you,
My kissin' won't bug you,
The gossips won't hurt you,
I'll never desert you,
And someday will find us
Where people won't bind us
To the hands of time.
I can use more than moments, pretty baby,
And I know where you steal them from.
There are so many things I'll teach you,
And they call me a useless bum.
They just chatter and clatter
And patter and matter,
They titter and twitter,
Their glitter gets bitter,
But we're here,
I steered here,
It's weird here,
Those beards, dear,
Watch the pantomime.
Watch the pantomime.
