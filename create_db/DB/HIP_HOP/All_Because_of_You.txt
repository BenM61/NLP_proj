I can't blame you if you want to leave
Cause I'm not the man that I once used to be
But there's a change that has come over me
So before you go, listen to my last plea

(All because of you) ooh, you're the love of my life
And I was doin' wrong but I want to do right girl
(All because of you) stayin' out all night
Want to make it right, want to change my life girl
(All because of you) I don't want to play no games
Want to change your name to my name baby
(All because of you) not goin' be the man that I used to be, no
I changed because of you

Can't take back the things that I did before
But baby I'm promising that my heart is yours(yours)
Know it ain't easy baby, but you gotta believe me baby
All I'm askin' for is one more chance, I changed because of you

(All because of you) ooh, you're the love of my life
And I was doin' wrong but I want to do right girl
(All because of you) stayin' out all night
Want to make it right, want to change my life girl
(All because of you) I don't want to play no games
Want to change your name to my name baby
(All because of you) not goin' be the man that I used to be
I changed because of you

I-I-I-I, I want to do right by you girl
I-I-I-I, I want to spend my life with you girl
I don't want to play no games, want to change your name to my name baby
I'm turnin' in my player's card.. all because of you

It used to be that you in the club poppin' bottles, wrists glistenin'
Shorty tried to tell me 'chill', but I wasn't listenin'
I can't deny, you knew me from bein' immature
Homeboy was sayin' 'sorry', take you to the country store
You told me all you really wanted was to see me more
Then the stress hit me hard like a meteor
I hit rock bottom, you was there to pick me up
I neglected you but then we'd hug and we'd kiss it up
But you never do nuttin' up in my face
Gave me all your love and your warm embrace
But now I see I'll neva find another like you
You the type boo, make a playa want to wife you
But me and you, this money's not a issue
When I miss you, when I touch you, I can feel it in my bones
I'm still wit you and I'm sorry 'bout the way I did you

(All because of you) ooh, you're the love of my life
And I was doin' (ooh) wrong but I want to do right girl
(All because of you) stayin' out all night (no more stayin' out at night, ooh)
Want to make it right, want to change my life girl
(All because of you) I don't want to play no games 
(See I don't want to play no games, no games, yea, ooh)
Want to change your name to my name baby
(All because of you) not goin' be the man that I used to be 
(Not the man I used to be, no, yea yea)
I changed because of you
