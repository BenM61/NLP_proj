Take, your chance for paradise
I'm looking in your eyes
You might be mine tonight

Yeah, I'm feeling like a fool
'Cause you still act so cool
Spend the night with me

I can lose my heart tonight (tonight)
If you're lonely, feel alright (alright)
This is just the night for me (for me) and you

I can lose my heart tonight (tonight)
Are you lonely deep inside (deep inside)
There is something in the air (in the air) tonight

I can feel it everywhere
There's magic in the air
You might be mine tonight

Yeah, I feel so hypnotized
I feel like paradise
I see heaven in your eyes

I can lose my heart tonight (tonight)
If you're lonely, feel alright (alright)
This is just the night for me (for me) and you

I can lose my heart tonight (tonight)
Are you lonely deep inside (deep inside)
There is something in the air (in the air) tonight

Take me in your arms (take me in your arms)
Hold me close tonight (hold me close tonight)
Take my heart away (take my heart away)
Take me to the night

I can lose my heart tonight (tonight)
If you're lonely, feel alright (alright)
This is just the night for me (for me) and you

I can lose my heart tonight (tonight)
Are you lonely deep inside (deep inside)
There is something in the air (in the air) tonight
