Heaven and earth
Are mine says I

Over the western world
Shadows fall
Under the kind and dying trees we call
Together still, the feel, the breeze
To shatter all these waking dreams we've told
Ourselves to keep us free and clean

Heaven and earth
Are mine says I

There is a love that sleeps inside
The canyons of our deepest dreaming lives
A shelter that cannot be lost
A name that is so deep and so far across

I know you that you know me
Your life is like a bolt of lightning seen
Across the sky, so high and clean

Heaven and earth
Are mine says I

Over the western world
Shadows fall
Under the kind and dying trees we call
Together still, the feel, the breeze
To shatter all these waking dreams we've told
Ourselves, ourselves, ourselves, ourselves

Heaven and earth
Are mine says I
