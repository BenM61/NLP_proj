I heard they exploded the underground blast
What they say's gonna happen, gonna happen at last
That's the way it appears

They tell me the fault line runs right through here
So that may be, that may be, what's gonna happen, gonna happen to me
That's the the way it appears

They tell me the fault line runs right through here

Atlantis will rise, sunset Boulevard will fall
Where the beach use to be won't be nothin' at all
That's the way it appears

They tell me the fault line runs right through here
So that may be, that may be, what's gonna happen gonna happen to me
That's the way it appears

They tell me the fault line runs right through here

They tell me the fault line runs right through here
