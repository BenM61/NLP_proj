I came and saw you left the light on
There was no one home at all
Couldn't wait to get your clothes on
Shouldn't come around to call on you

The taste was sweet and you delivered
I didn't know I would feel so high
Well, I guess we didn't have to kill her
But don't feel so bad though

You looked her in the eye
And I watched her cry
And my mouth went dry
Everyone is going to have to die sometime

My mouth is clean, my hands are dirty
Heaven isn't on my side
Well, if it was, then she'd have hurt me
Didn't think this through

But, I didn't have the time
To perfect my crime
I drank my wine
Everything is going to be just fine

I don't know, I don't love, (you're alone, you're alone) I don't know
Anyone like me

I'm not heaven sent
I'm not heaven sent
But I'm broken and bent

My mouth went dry
As I watched her cry
Everyone has to, gets to die
But not on my time not on this girl's time
Fucked if it's my time (fucked if it's my time)
Not on my time(this is all fucked up)
