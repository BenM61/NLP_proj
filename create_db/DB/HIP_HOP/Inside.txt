Inside... 
Inside... 
Inside... 
Last night when I saw you 
With somebody new 
You asked how I've been 
And I  I told you I was fine 
And as you held each other close 
I smiled and said it's good to see you 
And you didn't know 
Inside 
I'm cryin' baby 
Inside 
I'm dyin' baby 
I don't want to let you see 
Baby what you've done to me 
So I keep it all inside (inside) 
Inside (inside) 
Sometimes when you call me 
I don't know what to say 
You say I've been on your mind 
And we'll talk again sometime 
You say you're glad we can be friends 
I say I'm over all the heartache 
But it's all pretend 
Inside 
I'm cryin' baby 
Inside 
I'm dyin' baby 
I don't want to let you see 
Baby what you've done to me 
So I keep it all inside 
Inside 
Outside I'm smilin' baby 
Outside these tears just can't be found 
But I'm just breaking down 
INSIDE 
Don't you know that I am dyin' baby (dyin' baby) 
I don't want to let you see 
Baby what you've done to me 
So I'll keep it all INSIDE 
Yeah, I'm cryin' baby 
Inside 
I'm dyin' baby 
I don't want to let you see 
Baby what you've done to me 
So I'll keep it all inside 
I'll just keep it all inside 
Inside... 
Inside...
