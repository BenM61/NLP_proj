She's my kind of girl
The girl?s alright with me, yeah
She's my kind of girl
How lucky can one man be

Ooh, I take her out to have a good time
She lets me know that she's mine all mine
When we're together and she squeezes me
A single touch from her is ecstasy, oh yeah

I like the way she holds me
Oh, oh, she's alright with me
She's my kind of girl
How lucky can one man be, yeah

I took her home the other day
Her sister and brother asked me if I?d stay
I met her mother and daddy too
I felt at home, they did everything they could do, oh yeah

they're my kind of people
And oh, oh, they're alright with me
She's my kind of girl
And how lucky can one man be

she's my kind of girl
Oh, oh, she's alright with me
She's my kind of girl
