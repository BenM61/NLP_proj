Boy
You know that you haven't changed a bit

You keep talking that same old know it hurt
Lipstick on your shirt
Boy
You
'Cause it wasn't mine
Said it wasn't mine.
I gave you all my trust and now it's turned to dust.
You were my boyfriend
I said my boyfriend

You were seen with other girls
Cute pony tails and curl.
Say
What's their names
I want to know their names.
I keep falling upon your line
Love can really make you blind.
Will it ever change
Nothing ever changes.
The record keeps spinning baby
Round and round

Don't you know it's just the same old sound
Yeah
Oh yeah.
The record keeps spinning
Baby
Round and round

Don't you know it's just the same old sound
Yeah
Oh yeah.
Boy
You know that you haven't changed a bit

You keep talking that same old...
The record keeps spinning
Baby
Round and round

Don't you know it's just the same old sound
Yeah
Oh yeah.
You took my Cadillac and never brought it back

Now that's not right
Said that's not right.
Boy
You've gone too far
You've got girls in my car.
You're driving me crazy
I said crazy

And oh
How you lied and oh how I cried

All through the night
All through the night.
Should've known you'd be the same I guess
I'm the one to blame

Will it ever change
Nothing ever changes.

The record keeps spinning
Baby
Round and round...

It's like a broken record
Broken record
Broken record
Broken record

Broken record
Broken record
Broken record
Broken record.

Break
Break
Break
Break
Break
Break
Break
Break

Like a broken record
Broken record
Broken record
Broken record...

Break
Break
