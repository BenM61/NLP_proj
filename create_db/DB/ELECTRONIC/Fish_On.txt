Catching ladies is my delight
So I go fishing by shiny night
Doesn't matter black or blond
I threw my worm into the pond

Water, water in the sea
Bring your creatures up to me
I pull them up, release my spawn
Fish on
Water, water soaky cloud
Help me get your creatures out
Let them come release my spawn
Fish on

It smells like fish, I take a sniff
The bait is fresh, my rod is stiff
The hook is big, made from steel
I put some grease upon my reel

Some are bigger, some are small
I don't care, I catch them all

Water, water in the sea
Bring your creatures up to me
I pull them up, release my spawn
Fish on
Water, water soaky cloud
Help me get your creatures out
Let them come release my spawn
Fish on

I got my rod, I have my spear
I've already set my fishing gear
Moby's dick is out of sight
They found my Nemo every night

Some are bigger, some are small
I don't care, I catch them all

Water, water in the sea
Bring your creatures up to me
I pull them up, release my spawn
Fish on
Water, water soaky cloud
Help me get your creatures out
Let them come release my spawn
Fish on
Water, water in the sea
Let your mermaids all be free
I get it out, release my spawn
Fish on
