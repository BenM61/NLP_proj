Take me on a ride inside your heart tonight
Just you and me,
Take me to live inside the truth.

Sugar, I wanna taste the way you feel inside,
All through the night
Forget about the time 
Just close your eyes

Sugar, always
Though my heart, it breaks, baby

Oh, let me be the one to come alone 
Let me just be such a deep surprise

As the world you know begins to cry tonight
Just let it be, if you wanna grow it all must die

Sugar, we can come alive inside your dreams tonight,
Live to believe you are the only one for me
