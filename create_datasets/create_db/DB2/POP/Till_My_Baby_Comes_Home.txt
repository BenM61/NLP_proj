Not sure girl, been gone for long long still 
And now the Romeos are knocking and ringin' my bell 
They just keep hangin' around 
Steady to right to break me down 

Oh but their ain't gonna be no love 
No no no no no no no no 
There ain't gonna be no love 
Till my baby comes home 

Temptation comes creeping into my mind 
I'm only human and I'm feelin' weak sometimes 
When you're waitin' for a special guy 
You wanted to trust and satisfy 

Oh but their ain't gonna be no love 
No no no no no no no no 
There ain't gonna be no love 
Till my baby comes home
