
Well it seems as though this light will never turn green 
I've been driving for a while, can't tell where I've been 
I got nothing on my mind, I got nothing to do 
I'm just driving around listening to Nebraska 

Well, my girl, she told me last night I'm not the one 
Half my heart was ripped out but I still got some 
And if this light should stay red 
I'll be sitting here listening to Nebraska 

I was trying so hard to get to you 
Now I'm driving so far to forget you 
Well, tonight I should be lying with you in a never-ending night 
Well, tonight I should be lying in a never-ending kiss 
But I'm alone on this dark road listening to Nebraska
