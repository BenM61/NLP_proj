Rise To The Challenge
Time is a ticking so you'd better start linking
Energies surging vision is blurring
Maybe you're feeling you're not up to scratch
Maybe you're feeling that now you've met your match
You find it hard to know where to begin 
When Discontent is spreading its wings
Stand by your belief and have faith in this sound
You know that you can always turn it around
Feel the rhythm and its healing remedy
Listen to the sweet melody
Feel the rhythm and its healing remedy 
Rise To The Challenge!
Keep Risin you know we rinse on
Turn negative to positiveWith a natural vibe
Believe in yourself and rinse out the mind
The tongue and the hand moving different directions
Turn dis disconnection into interconnection
Feel the rhythm and its healing remedy
Listen to the sweet melody
Feel the rhythm and its healing remedy
Rise To The Challenge!
How can you live your life with no enthusiasm
Or else you fall so deep
Rearrange all the thoughts you like to hold back
Jump across the track
'cause we on the attack
