Build a wall of books between us in our bed
Repeat, repeat the words I know we both said
Relax into the need we get so comfortable
Remember when I was so strange and likeable

I just want back in your head
I just want back in your head
I'm not unfaithful but I'll say
When I get a little scared
When I get a little scared
When I get a little

When I jerk away from holding hands with you
I know these habits hurt important parts of you
Remember when how sweet and unexplainable
Nothing like this person unloveable

I just want back in your head
I just want back in your head
I'm not unfaithful but I'll say
When I get a little scared
When I get a little scared
When I get a little

Run, run, run
Run
Run, run, run
Run

I just want back in your head
I just want back in your head
I'm not unfaithful but I'll stray
I'm not unfaithful but I'll stray
I'm not unfaithful but I'll stray
I'm not unfaithful but I'll stray
