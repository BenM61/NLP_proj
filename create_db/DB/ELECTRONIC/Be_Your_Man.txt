I don't wanna drive your car
I don't wanna dance
I don't want your diamond rings
I don't want your demands
You make me crazy

Yes, you're so divine, I want you all the time
Till no satisfaction, got to make you mine

You take me through changes
Love or let me go, oh, oh
I'm just the man for you, baby
I think you should know, oh, oh

I wanna be your man, baby, oh, oh, oh
I wanna be your man, baby, oh, oh, oh

I don't wanna take you out
Don't want you to go
I don't wanna hold your hand
?
You make me crazy, horns

Did you like that, baby
Can I do it one more time?
Everybody, baby, clap your hands
You wanna sing my line

You take me through changes
Love or let me go, oh, oh
I'm just the man for you, baby
I think you should know, oh, oh

I wanna be your man, baby, oh, oh, oh
I wanna be your man, baby, oh, oh, oh
I wanna be your man, baby, oh, oh, oh
I wanna be your man, baby, oh, oh, oh
Just stay tonight

You take me through changes
Love or let me go, oh, oh
I'm just the man for you, baby
I think you should know, oh, oh

I wanna be your man, baby, oh, oh, oh
I wanna be your man, baby, oh, oh, oh
I wanna be your man, baby, oh, oh, oh
I said, I wanna be your man, baby, oh, oh, oh
Break it down

Everybody, everybody break it
Hit me, everybody c'mon
Everybody, baby
