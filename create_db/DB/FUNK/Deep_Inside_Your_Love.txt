Deep Inside Your Love 
Ready for the World 
How does it feel
To be lonely inside with no one there?
You don't want to know
But this is what's happening to me oh o oh
And every day I wake I realize that I'm on my own
Without you

I'm so
Deep I'm so deep 
Inside of you girl

I'm so
Deep I'm so deep
Inside your love

I can't even think I can't even eat
Thinking bout your love
You always on my mind
I don't know whats wrong with me
You a part of me honey can't you see
I need you oh oh oh 

I'm so
Deep I'm so deep 
Inside of you girl

I'm so
Deep I'm so deep
Inside your love

It's your love that I want
It's your love that I need every night
Cause deep inside of you
Is where always wanted to be
Another sleepless night it not the way
It's gonna be
I need you

I'm so
Deep I'm so deep 
Inside of you girl

I'm so
Deep I'm so deep
Inside your love

You just don't know what you doing to me girl
