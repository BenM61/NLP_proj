So this is the kingdom of heaven
So this is the sweet promised land
While angels tell of love, don't break the spell of love
Hold my hand

So this is the garden of Eden
In dreams it was never so grand
Let's never leave again, Adam and Eve again
Hold my hand

This is the secret of what bliss is
For bliss is what your kiss is
At last I understand

So this is the kingdom of heaven
And here on the threshold we stand
Pass through the portal now, we'll be immortal now
Hold my hand

So this is the kingdom of heaven
And here on the threshold we stand
Pass through the portal now, we'll be immortal now
Hold my hand
Hold my hand
