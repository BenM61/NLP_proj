With the power that some lovin' can bring
makes the mountain high stacks of money and things
That I need change
And fade away sometimes
When I look in the mirror
I see a little clearer
I am what I am
And you are you to
Do you like what you see? 
Do you like yourself?
 
Money love
And goldpayments
We spend our lives thinking they are saviors
Money talks but love is for real
And you know that, uhuhuh...

Then a picture comes into my mind
Everybody knows you need some money sometimes
Could it be that we need lovin' to survive 
So look into my eyes
I wont tell you lies
Who do you see?
Do you see yourself?
Do you like what you see?
Do you like yourself?

Money love
And goldpayments
We spend our lives thinking they are saviors
Money talks but love is for real
And you know that, uhuhuh...

So how do we drink in a sinking ship?
How do we float in a sinking boat?
How do we rock when the rock is rollin'?
Give me a float & keep the mool a rollin'?
Talking about talking about talking about money
Nothing's for free in the land of milk'n honey
Got a foot on the bridge over troubled water
A credit cards cool but I'll settle for a quarter
