Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen and down the mountain side
The summer's gone and all the flowers falling
'T's you, 't's you, must go and I must bide

But come ye back when summer's in meadow
Or when the valleys hushed and white with snow
'Tis I'll be there in sunshine or in the shadow
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so

And when you come and all the flowers are dying
If I am dead, as dead I will may be
You'll come and find the place where I am lying
And 'neel and say an 'Ave' for me

And I shall hear those soft you tread above me
And all my grave will warm and sweeter be
If you will built and tell me that you love me
Then I shall sleep in peace until you come to me
