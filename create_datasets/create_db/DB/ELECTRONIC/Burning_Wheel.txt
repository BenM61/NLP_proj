Through my diseased eyes
I'm sinful, sly 
I can't stop stealing 
I will pay the price of being a thief 
When I stop breathing 
If you could see what I can see 
Feel what I feel 
When my head is on fire 
When I'm a burning wheel 
Through my bleeding eyes
I'm filthy, fly 
I crawl with insects 
I'm anaesthetized
I'm demonized caught in the vortex
If you could see what I can see 
Feel what I feel 
When my head is on fire 
When I'm a burning wheel 
I see, I feel, I see, I feel I see, I feel, I see, I feel
If you could see what i can see 
Feel what I feel 
When my head is on fire 
When I'm a burning wheel
