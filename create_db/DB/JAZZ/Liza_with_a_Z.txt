Thank you very much, you're really terrific
And seeing how you are, can I tell ya something, I have a problem
No wait, it's not a big problem, but it is a problem
It's my name, you know I find that still - a lot of people call me Lisa - Wrong
My name is Liza - Liza - has a 'Z' in it
Well, for instance, somebody'll come up to me on the street and say
Hello Lisa how are you, I'll say, I'm fine thank you but it's Liza
Or somebody'll say - Lisa what a nice hat you have on
I'll say thank you very much but my name is Liza and that's my hair
So you can see what I mean
Anyway, I've been trying to figure out a final solution to this whole thing
And I think I've come up with the answer - Jack

It's Liza with 'Z' not Lisa with an 'S', 'Cause Lisa with an 'S' goes SSno'ZZ
It's 'Z' instead of 'S', 'Lie' instead of 'Lee', It's simple as can be, see, Liza
I'll do it again
It's Liza with 'Z' not Lisa with an 'S', 'Cause Lisa with an 'S' goes SSno'ZZ
It's 'Z' instead of 'S', 'Lie' instead of 'Lee', It's simple as can be, see, Liza

Now - if my name were Ada, I'd be Ada, even backwards I'd be Ada
Or if my name were Ruth, then I'd be Ruth because with Ruth what can you do
Or Sally, or Margaret or Ginger or Faye
But when you're a Liza you always have to say

Nn - It's Liza with 'Z' not Lisa with an 'S', 'Cause Lisa with an 'S' goes SSno'ZZ
It's 'Z' instead of 'S', 'Lie' instead of 'Lee', It's simple as can be, see, Liza

Ah - And that is only half of it - there's another way they treat me cruelly
How often I remember someone saying, there
