When her motor's warm, and she's purrin' sweet
Buddy let me warn ya', you're on a one-way street
She'll crowd ya' close, spin your wheels
Then you're gonna know how it feels

To spinout..spinout
Better watch those curves, never let her steer
If she can shake your nerves..boy
She can strip your gears

She'll get your heart, goin' fast
Then she'll let you run out of gas
So spinout...spinout
The road to love is full of, danger signs

Too many guys were lost
Who crossed those double lines
Doncha know she's out to prove, she can really score
Never saw parts move, boy

Like that before
To flag you down, that's her goal
Scoot before you lose control
And spinout... spinout!!
