You're gonna push your luck 
Tell me you've had enough 
I'm taking off these gloves 
Get down and lick the dust 

Wanna piece of this, wanna, wanna piece of this 
Cherry pie, what you, what you gonna make of this? 
One minute in the back seat you hit the switch 
I'm a predator, rapture, I am killin' it 
I am killin' it 
I'm a predator, rapture, I am killin' it 
I am killin' it 

Got you sweating from the heart baby night and day 
Ima punch to your gut and take your breath away 
Love drunk in the craze when you get a taste 
I'm an earthquake, feel my rage till I get my way 
Like a drug, come on, come on gotta get your fix 
Eat your heart out then seal it with a kiss 
Aim high, pull the trigger till I get a hit 
I'm a predator, rapture, I am killin' it 
I am killin' it 

I'm a predator, rapture, I am killin' it 
I am killin' it.
