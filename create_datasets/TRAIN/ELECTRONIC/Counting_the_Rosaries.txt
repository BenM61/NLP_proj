Not an eye was dry
In heaven or on earth
The angels did cry
Why are angels crying
In a place so full of grace
With happiness and love
Counting the rosaries
Counting 1-2-3
Counting the rosaries
Counting the rosaries
Counting 1-2-3
Counting the rosaries
Happiness and love
Happiness and love
Hope and wish and pray
Somehow, some way
The angels won't cry
The angels will not cry
All is bright
Heart screwed in tight
With happiness and love
Counting the rosaries
Counting 1-2-3
Counting the rosaries
Counting the rosaries
Easy as A-be	-see
Counting the rosaries
Happiness and love
