Don't you go. Can't you see what I feel inside 
I need to show all the things I could do to you 
Oh baby please come and don't try to fool around 
No time, when you're right with me
My baby 

Funny funny boy, you're my secret little toy 
Oh I love to hold you tight 
You make me feel so right 
Funny funny boy, you're my favorite kind of joy 
No, you're gonna stay the night 
It's gonna be all right 

I'm in the mood for some action. I want you baby 
I got you loaded for the things I will do with you 
No need for love,
When I got you here with me 
The satisfaction and I feel when you ride with me 
My baby
