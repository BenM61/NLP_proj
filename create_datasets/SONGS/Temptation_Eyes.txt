She's got something that moves my soul
And she knows I'd love to love her
But she lets me down every time
Can't make her mine she's no-one's lover
Tonight with me she'll be so inviting
I want her all for myself

Temptation eyes looking through my-my-my soul
Temptation eyes, you got to love me
Got to love me tonight

Her wild-eyed innocence is just a game
But just the same my head is spinnin'
She's got a way to keep me on her side
It's just a ride that's never ending
Tonight with me she'll be so exciting
I want her all for myself

Temptation eyes looking through my-my-my soul
Temptation eyes, you got to love me
Got to love me tonight

Tonight with me she'll be so exciting
I want her all for myself

Temptation eyes looking through my-my-my soul
Temptation eyes, you got to love me
Got to love me tonight
