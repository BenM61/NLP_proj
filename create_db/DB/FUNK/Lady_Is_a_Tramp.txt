I've wined and dined on mulligan stew
On "Live at Talk of the Town" inserted: I have, I have
And never wished for turkey
I've hitched and hiked and drifted to

From Maine to Alberquque
Alas I missed the beaux arts ball
And what is twice as sad
I was never at a party

Where they honoured Noel Coward
On "Live at Talk of the Town":
I was never at Barbra Streisands party - aaah
And that make me bloody mad

A...[unknown] funny girl
On "At The Pigalle":
Alas I'm always known as being in the pie(??)
I was never at Alma Cogans party

A shame
When she honoured Ringo Starr
On "The Birthday Concert" & video "An Audience With Shirley Bassey":
I was never at Hugh Grants party

When he honoured the great divide - ouh
His social circles move to fast for me
My hobohemia is the place to be 
I get too hungry for dinner at eight

I love the theatre but never come late
I never bother with people I hate
That's why this lady is a tramp 
I don't like crap games with barons and earls

Won't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls
Won't dish the dirt with the rest of those girls
That's why this lady is a tramp 
I like the free fresh wind in my hair

Life without care
I'm broke... that's oke
Hate California, it's cold and it's damp
That's why this lady is a tramp 

I like the free fresh wind in my hair
On "Live at Talk of the Town": I like the free fresh wind in my wig
Life without care
I'm broke... that's oke

Hate California, it's cold and it's damp
That's why this lady is a tramp 
And I love it
Yes, I'm a tramp, and I love it

And I wish that you will come in my way yeah
I wish that you will come in my way yeah
I wish that you will come in my way
Yes, I'm a lady

But a tramp
