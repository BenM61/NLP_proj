I get sick of living in the city
Everyone's a liar and a thief
If the cancer don't
The taxman's gonna get you
If the women don't
The doctors let you bleed

I don't want to hang around with you
Don't want to see you burn
I don't want to see you turn blue
I want to see the sun

Gimme, gimme, gimme medication
Gimme medication to cure this hole
Gimme, gimme, gimme medication
Gimme medication to cure this, cure this hole

Everyone's steppin' on each other
Shootin', snortin', smokin' all they can
I wish that blood was thicker than water
'Cause drinkin' dirty water kills a man

I don't want to hang around with you
Don't want to see you burn
I don't want to see you turn blue
I want to see the sun

Gimme, gimme, gimme medication
Gimme medication to cure this hole
Gimme, gimme, gimme medication
Gimme medication to cure this, cure this hole

I get sick of living in the city
Everyone's a liar and a thief
If the cancer don't
The taxman's gonna get you
If the women don't
The doctors let you bleed

Gimme, gimme, gimme medication
Gimme medication to cure this hole
Gimme, gimme, gimme medication
Gimme medication to cure this, cure this hole

Gimme, gimme, gimme medication
Gimme medication to cure this hole
Gimme, gimme, gimme medication
Gimme medication to cure this, cure this hole
