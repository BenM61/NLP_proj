Life's just like a dream
Just a beautiful dream
Under a blue jungle moon

Love calls out to love
From the wood and the stream
Call with a weird savage tune
Through the night comes melodies entrancing
All through the night in pairs the world romancing
My own heart calls too
Jungle sweetheart for you
Under a blue jungle moon

Through the night comes melodies entrancing
All through the night in pairs the world romancing
My own heart calls too
Jungle sweetheart for you
Under a blue jungle moon
