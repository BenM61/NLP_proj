What it do, hey. 
Little mama you a dime piece. 
In the club lookin' sharper than a starch crease. 
It's all eyes on you. Baby girl you outta sight. 
Nails done, hair did,dress flier than a kite. 
I see you skatin' on the dance floor showin 'that. 
I'm tryin' to holla at you baby what you talkin' bout. 
I'm on the sidelines plottin' I'm 'on make a move. 
Bout to get my groove on, baby tell me what it do. What it do. 

I got you open baby, I know you like what you see. 
Your lookin' at my body. 
Tryin' to sneak up on me. 
Your just starin' from the time I walked through the door. 
I know you want me but I cant just hit the floor. 

All the boys in the club rock with me. 
All the girls body rock if you hear me. 
Cause tonight is the night for me to shine and do it right. 

[Repeat: x2] 
Cause I'm feelin' like. 
All eyes on me. 
And I know that you want a piece of me. 
I'm feelin' like. 
All eyes on me. 
But when my body moves, its makin' you crazy. 
I got you feelin' for me. 

And I know you want me baby. I got you in the mood. 
Its getting hard to shake it. 
Your tellin' me you never met a girl like this before. 
I got you wantin more, and you cant ignore. 

All the boys in the club rock with me. 
All the girls body rock if you hear me. 
Cause tonight is the night for me to shine and do it right. 

[Repeat: x2] 
Cause I'm feelin' like. 
All eyes on me. 
And I know that you want a piece of me. 
I'm feelin' like. 
All eyes on me. 
But when my body moves, its makin' you crazy. 
I got you feelin' for me. 

I got my eyes on you baby, from your feet up to ya head. 
To the perfect night it'd be if I could see you in my bed. 
I could beat around the bush, I'm 'on be real instead. 
We could go round for round, is you down ? 
Are you scared? Cause I can move your hips left to right. 
Make a playa wanna go ahead and slide inside. 
I wanna be the one you ride tonight. 
And if it feel like it look, you can ride for life. 

Cause I'm feelin' like. All eyes on me. 
And I know that you want a piece of me. 
I'm feelin' like. All eyes on me. 
But when my body moves, its makin' you crazy. 
I got you feelin' for me. 

Hey. 
Nana nana. 
All eyes on me. 
But when my body moves, its makin' you crazy. 
All eyes on me. 
And I know that you want a piece of me.
