Well what have we here, what do I see
I think someone's coming up to challenge me
I love it, I say bring it, I'm well prepared
Confidence rises with the heat out there

This thing is great
My excitement will not abate
I will act and not hesitate
Listen all you can relate
Like a skater with the best of skates
Confidence elevates
Looking for an ecstatic state
You are the master of your own fate
Watch how we radiate
Get up little children, levitate

I look and I look for the euphoric state
We've been putting our time in 
While you were playing games
Searching for a state of ecstasy
The cynical armchair experts 
I'll just let them be

This thing is great
My excitement will not abate
I will act and not hesitate
Listen all you can relate
Like a skater with the best of skates
Confidence elevates
Looking for an ecstatic state
You are the master of your own fate

Gather round the schoolyard gate, 
History will record this date
Feel the shifting tectonic plates, 
You can get it even if you're straight
Allow me to illustrate, how we humbly will create
Time for the shake and bake
Get up, little children, levitate

This thing is great
My excitement will not abate
I will act and not hesitate
Listen all you can relate
Like a skater with the best of skates
Give a man a clean slate
Gonna stay up late

You are the master of your own fate
Gather round the schoolyard gate, 
History will record this date
Feel the shifting tectonic plates, 
You can get it even if you're straight
And the village children levitate
And the village children elevate

Allow me to illustrate, 
How we humbly will create
Time for the master of time and space, 
Time for the shake and bake
This is how we levitate
