Hold on now, I'm choking
Give me a second to collect myself
You must be joking
Otherwise I'm laughing to myself

Why you here again
Hold on a minute, let me check this out
Your invitation's a fake
Must be from a ticket tout

I hear you out, you hear me out
I hear you shout, I'm not stepping out
I hear you out, you hear me out
I hear you shout, I'm not stepping out

Little grey fairy tales
And little white lies
Everything you exhale is attracting flies

And you can go off the rails
And you can cry your eyes out
But everything you exhale is attracting flies

Please stay, it's your moment
I'll give you all the listening that you need
Don't be a showman
Who needs the drama
Who said you had to bleed

I'm excited
Come on, surprise me, sweep me off my feet
Oh, enlighten me
What is this special thing 'bout you I need

I hear you out, you hear me out
I hear you shout, I'm not stepping out
I hear you out, you hear me out
I hear you shout, I'm not stepping out

Little grey fairy tales
And little white lies
Everything you exhale is attracting flies

And you can go off the rails
And you can cry your eyes out
But everything you exhale is attracting flies

How'd you think it felt when you stuck the knife in
You know my heart died and you had me aching
How about a piece of your own medicine
Now you're outside there tryna get in

Baby, why would I care if you want me
Baby, why would I care if you don't
Baby, why would I care if you need me
Baby, why would I care if you don't

Little grey fairy tales
And little white lies
Everything you exhale is attracting flies

And you can go off the rails
And you can cry your eyes out
But everything you exhale is attracting flies
