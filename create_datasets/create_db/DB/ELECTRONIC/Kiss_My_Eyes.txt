Over
Come over
Over
Come over

In the dark the dance begins and night starts to ?
Feel the beat of extasy inside your soul
Something hard 
And make believe that love is real and sense is state control
Let's be dangerous if only for one romance

Come
And kiss my eyes
Come
And kiss my eyes
Over
Oome, we're over, come
Over
Come, we're over, come
Over 
Come over
Over 
Come over

In the dark the magic spins and we forget the day
Feel the rush of ? inside your soul one to one
Now take a chance the love is here and love is all we know (we touch and want to know)
Let's be dangerous live only for the moment

Come
And kiss my eyes
Come
And kiss my eyes
Over
Come, we're over, come
Over
Come, we're over, come
Over 
Come over
Over 
come over

Come uhhh
