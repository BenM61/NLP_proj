I like to bite my nails
And play the air guitar
I like to keep my suitcase packed cause I'm going far
I think you're nice but
I don't wanna waste my time
I may seem crazy but don't worry I'm just fine

All the way up
All the way down
Never look back
It's time to breakout
I want it my way
I do what I do
I know what I like
And maybe it's you
Let's rock
It's a temporary life
It's a ride
That takes you all the way up
All the way down
Never look back it's time to breakout

I like to go out walking
In the pouring rain
I want my rock n roll to
Make the window shake
I wait 'til three am
To call everyone I know
I'm gonna bring the noise
I'm ready here we go

All the way up
All the way down
Never look back
It's time to breakout
I want it my way
I do what I do
I know what I like
And maybe it's you
Let's rock
It's a temporary life
It's a ride
That takes you all the way up
All the way down
Never look back it's time to breakout

It's my life and it's a riot
Come on baby you can't deny it

All the way up
All the way down
Holdin' my breath
Lettin' it out
I want it my way
I do what I do
I know what I like
Baby

All the way up
All the way down
Never look back
It's time to breakout
I want it my way
I do what I do
I know what I like
And maybe it's you
Let's rock
It's a temporary life
It's a ride
That takes you all the way up
All the way down
Never look back it's time to breakout

It's time to breakout
It's time to breakout
Right now
