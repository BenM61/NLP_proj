I see a sense of wonder 
Deep inside your eyes 
As we're sparkling and twirling 
In the twilight 
And after three long years, 
I think that we both need this 
So we seal the deal 
In the parking lot with a kiss 

And in case you 
And in case you were wondering, 
You are like a sunset to me 
You're all kinds of beautiful 
As you end my day 
And you sweetly retire 
As stars chase you away 

I'd collapse to the grass, 
With your notes ringing in my head 
Let the rain fill my mouth, 
And in a couple hours I'll be dead 
But all the while my lips 
Are whistling our tune 
But the beauty lies in how 
You will revive me soon 

And in case you, and in case you 
And in case you were wondering, 
You are like a sunset to me 
You're all kinds of beautiful 
As you end my day 
And you sweetly retire 
As the stars chase you away 

And in case you were wondering, 
You are like a sunset to me 
You're all kinds of beautiful 
As you end my day 
And you sweetly retire 
As the stars chase you away 

And in case you were wondering, 
You are like a hurricane to me 
Your violence is beautiful, 
And your center sweet 
Now tell me this, 
Do you know how we'd meet? 

And in case you were wondering, 
You are everything to me (to me)
