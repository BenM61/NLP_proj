California, California.

Well I know you now, understand you now,
And I love you more each day.
California girl, California girl,
You're the best thing that I've seen in a while.
California girl, California girl,
There must be something magic in your smile.

Now when I came to this California town,
I came here to make the big time.
But I tried so hard, but got no rewards,
And it seemed that I was wasting my tim.

I was kicking around this lonesome town,
Trying to pick myself up instead of going down.
But something sure changed when I met you,
California now is looking bright and blue.

California girl, California girl,
Well it seemed that I was wasting my time,
California girl, California girl,
But now I know you girl and I love you girl,
And it seems that California's all mine.

I been knocking on doors trying to sell my songs,
I been gettin' refused everywhere I've gone.
But something sure changed when I met you,
California now is looking bright and blue.

California girl, California girl,
Well I don't know how to say what's on my mind.
But now I know you girl and I love you girl,
And it feels like California's all mine.

Well it feels like California's all mine
California, California girl.
California, California.
