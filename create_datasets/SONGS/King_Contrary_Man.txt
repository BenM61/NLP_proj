Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I saw the devil
The contrary man
I saw the devil down the long, long road

He said to me, boy
He said to me, boy
He said to me, boy

I said no, no
You can't take my soul

I took a while and thought about it
Down at the crossroads temptin' fate
I took a while and thought about it
Down at the crossroads temptin' fate
Yeah, yeah, yeah

You can take my soul
Take my soul

Play it, baby

Ow, yeah, ow

Zany antics of a beat generation
In their wild search for kicks
Fighting, drinking, scorning convention
Making wild love, making wild love

I saw the devil
The contrary man
I saw the devil down the long, long road
He said to me, boy
He said to me, boy
He said to me, boy
I want your soul
I said yeah
I said yeah
I said yeah
Yeah...

I want it all
I want it all
Yeah
