I'm going back
To the day we parted
And all the ways
You were broken hearted
Take a trip
Everyday in my mind

I see your face
I recall it few word
It's playing back
Like a broken record
I remember
Every tear in your eye

(If I do what I know)
I'd walk back in time
(I will write every wrong)
Oohh
I would change every line
(And you'll be here right now)
Just like yesterday
(But you'd feel no more doubts)
When you hear me say

You're the only one I want
(You're the only one, yeah)
You're the only one
I need in my life
(In my life, baby)
You're the only one I love
(I love, love, love)
You're the only one
I need in my life

I see the world
Through a haze of mem'ries
And other girls
Don't mean
A damn thing to me
It's kinda sad
How they just don't compare
(Time will tell
Let's wait and see)
(If our love
We had was meant to be)
Coz I know
We got a future out there

(Coz you're still my girl)
I don't care what they say
(Let's go back to our world)
Baby don't you throw
This love away
(Coz I still believe)
In the magic of us
(This is the matter of time)
And it's a matter of trial

Now girl it took sometime
To get real with myself
Now love
Ain't easy sometimes
But if you find it
We'll stay together
