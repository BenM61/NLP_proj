Born and raised as a rich man's son
You were always the restless one
Living high only made you low
So you packed up and hit the road

Hey, it's the Ragamuffin Man
Life was so grand, you used to stand
Holdin' your head up high
Look at you now, I wonder how
You can be satisfied

Stowed a ride on a westbound train
Called yourself by another name
Spent your nights in a mission home
Cast away the life that you'd known

Hey, it's the Ragamuffin Man
Life was so grand, you used to stand
Holdin' your head up high
Look at you now, I wonder how
You can be satisfied

As you rise in the mornin' rain
Take a look down that road again
Does the thought ever grab your mind
For the life that you've left behind?

Hey, it's the Ragamuffin Man
Life was so grand, you used to stand
Holdin' your head up high
Look at you now, I wonder how
You can be satisfied

Hey, it's the Ragamuffin Man
Ahhhhh, la la la la la la la
Hey, it's the Ragamuffin Man
