Here comes the rain
Another day, another storm
I've been down, down, down
For oh-so long

I'll walk this mile
And I'll ask no quarter
For in the end
Blood is thicker than water

They try to break me, but I refuse to die
They try to break me, but I refuse to cry

Here comes the rain
Another day, another storm
I'll walk this mile
And I'll ask no quarter
For in the end, blood is thicker than water

I'll walk this mile
And I'll ask no quarter
For in the end
Blood is thicker than water

I'll walk this mile
And I'll ask no quarter
For in the end
Blood is thicker than water
