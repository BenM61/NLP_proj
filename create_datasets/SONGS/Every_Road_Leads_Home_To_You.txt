I got your picture on my phone
Your voice in my head
I'm lying here alone
Restless in a faraway bed
The stars are falling down
And I'm a half a world away
I'm just trying to close the distance
To feel each breath that you take
breath

When the bridge is burning and I'm losing my faith
And I'm trying to find my way towards the truth
Like a wild arrow flying and I'm blindly running
From everything I thought I knew
Every road leads home to you, home to you

So you got me to believe
Made me turn on a dime
The writing on the wall
Right in front of me
Every song, every rhyme
But I don't need thousand words
I need you safe in my arms
I'll be standing strong, I'll keep holding on
When life tries tearing us apart

When the bridge is burning and I'm losing my faith
And I'm trying to find my way to the truth
Like a wild arrow flying and I'm blindly running
From everything I thought I knew

No, I ain't regretting just how lost I'm getting
Or the red lights I've been blowing through
My foot will find the pedal as I'm counting the lines
Every road leads home to you
Every road leads home to you
Home,
the road still leads me home to you
Sometimes I don't see the signs, 
The headlights make me blind
The road still leads me home to you

When the bridge is burning and I'm losing my faith
And I'm trying to find my way to the truth
Like a wild arrow flying and I'm blindly running
From everything I thought I knew

No, I ain't regretting
Just how lost I'm getting
Or the red lights I've been blowing through
My foot will find the pedal as I'm counting the lines
Every road leads home to you
Every road leads home to you
Home to you, home to you
Every road leads home to you
