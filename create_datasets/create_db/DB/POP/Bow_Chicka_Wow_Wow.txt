Once I throw on this, once I throw on this
It's over girl
Once I throw on this, once I throw on this
It's over girl

I hear you knock knock knock baby come on up
I hope you got got got something in yo' cup
'Cause I'm three shots deep and I ain't tryna sleep
Get your Red Bull on cause I'm ready
You've been playin' hard to get with me all night
We both know exactly what you want right
Don't tell me what you won't do
Tell me what you gon' do what you gon' do
Once I throw on this bow-chick-a-wow-wow

What you gonna say
You act like you gon leave
But I know you gon' stay
Break it down break it down down
Girl don't even play
Once I set the mood right

I'ma make sound like I'ma make you sound like
Are you tryna make me late wait wait till the second date
But I can't can't can't even contemplate
Waiting one more minute lemme jump in it
I brought you flowers and a teddy
You've been playin' hard to get with me all night
We both know exactly what you want right

Don't tell me what you gon' do
Tell me what you gon' do what you gon' do
Once I throw on this bow-chicka-wow-wow
What you gonna say, you act like you gon leave
But I know you gon' stay, break it down break it down down
Girl don't even play once I set the mood right

I'ma make you sound like
Yeah I can make you sound like
Now I ain't even gotta say shit
To make you feel alive girl you know you like that
Ow-oh-ow-oh-ow-ow-oh
Say I ain't even gotta say shit
To make you feel alive girl you know you like that
Ow-oh-ow-oh-ow-ow-oh

Once I throw on this bow-chicka-wow-wow
What you gonna say, you act like you gon leave
But I know you gon' stay
Break it down break it down down
Girl don't even play once I set the mood right
I'ma make you sound like, yeah I'ma I'ma make ya

Once I throw on this, once I throw on this
It's over girl
Once I throw on this, once I throw on this
It's over girl
