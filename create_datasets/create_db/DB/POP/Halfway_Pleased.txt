You're bathed and crowned
I'm bruised and torn
You're tied and cleaned
I'm shorn again

How will you raise or fall or will we try?
I'm halfway pleased to meet you

You're still and cool
Below the fray
I'm stemmed and mapped
You're cut away

How will we raise or fall or will we try?
I'm halfway pleased to meet you
I'm halfway pleased to meet you

You're shrunk and left
I'm staid and grown
You're boxed and down
I stand alone

How will we raise or fall or will we try?
I'm halfway pleased to meet you
I'm halfway pleased to meet you
I'm halfway pleased to meet you
