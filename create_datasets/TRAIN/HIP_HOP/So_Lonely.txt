Darkchild, it's ya boy Twista
That girl Mariah, it's that fire

You know I like the way you kick it, gurl
You know I like it when you in my world
Come here, lil' momma, lemme freak yo' body
Then roll wit me in the Bentley, white pearl

Girl, you know you get me so erotic
Especially when I be sippin' Hypnotiq
Got me feelin' like I'm smokin' on chronic
When we fuckin', it be so exotic

Now, I know that everything be on fire with Mariah
And she know, she be dealin' with a baller
Hiccup ashes and meet me through the wire
Fulfullin' desires like a Chi shot caller

Do you love how the Twista went at you?
Do you love when I hit it from the back too?
Let me feel how you hook up that one way
C'mon, baby girl, let me see what that do

I wish that we could, blow up the speakers
Over and over, (Incomprehensible) to see-cups
Forever, your lady, you act right, then maybe
Ain't nothin' to talk about, with the music loud
So then what do you say

Come to be my one and only
Inside I been so lonely, come, hold me
Wanna wrap myself around you
When baby, you don't want to
Come, make me say

Come to be my one and only
Inside I been so lonely, console me
Wanna wrap myself around you
When baby, you don't want to
Come, make me say

Now we pullin' up out the garage
In the platinum blue I-nage
Me and you about to hit that club
To the bar so we can sip that bub
Both of us together we be the livest
If I had to break it down, how would I describe it?

We the type of couple that when we get up with each other
We get it crackin' in the kitchen or the bedroom
It don't matter where we at, we be makin' noise
So play the track so the bass'll make your head boom

Break you off when you hold one leg up
And you know I like the way you put it on me
It's the East coast queen and the Midwest mob boss
Shawty, I'ma never leave you lonely

I wish that we could, blow up the speakers
Over and over, (Incomprehensible) to see-cups
Forever, your lady, you act right, then maybe
Ain't nothin' to talk about, with the music loud
So then what do you say

Come to be my one and only
Inside I been so lonely, come, hold me
Wanna wrap myself around you
When baby, you don't want to
Come, make me say

Come to be my one and only
Inside I been so lonely, console me
Wanna wrap myself around you
When baby, you don't want to
Come, make me say

Let me give it to you all night long
Let me give it to you through this song
Let me give it to you in the hallway
Let me give it to you on the balcony, baby

Give it to you on the East coast
Give it to you on the West coast
Give it to you down South
Let me give it to you in the Midwest, baby

Let me give it to you in the U.K.
Let me give it to you through the DJ
Let me give it to you in the rack or the back
I got you yankin' the sac that's how a freak play

Give it to you however you desire
And I gotta show you that I ain't a liar
I'ma console you even when you lonely
Come and listen to the Twista and Mariah

Soldier, show a girl what it do
After this boy, I promise to you
You got my body lit up like the moon
Way too persuasive I can't take it
I'm so caught up in you

Come to be my one and only
Inside I been so lonely, come, hold me
Wanna wrap myself around you
When baby, you don't want to
Come, make me say
