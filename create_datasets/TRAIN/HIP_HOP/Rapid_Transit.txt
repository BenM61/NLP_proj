Ladies and gentlemen
Dilated Peoples and all that

Everywhere we go now
Pack your bags, we goin' on a long trip man, guess what? We all
We all, all around the world
Worldwide, Dilated Peoples, Strong Arm Steady, let's go

All the people know now
Krondon, Phil the Agony, everybody around the world
International, domestic, Chicago, Ohio, Seattle
(Move through the city like rapid transit)

Everywhere we go now, I'm dead serious
You fuckin? with "The Best Damn Rap Show? period
Go strong 'til I'm delirious on the international stage
Like people here it is

Right here
From the LAX, worldwide direct, all the flights connect
Got the right to vote and we'll elect
And these labels can't stand us but give us these checks, yeah

Everywhere we go now
Move through the city, got a crew and tools to use with me
Cats got weak shit, come at me with a better line
I don't respect rappers, I respect Kevin Federline

Karma's good, judge slams the hammer
Got 16 on deck like Joe Montana
Blue states, red states, welcome us back
Every city got a coat rack to hang my hat

Evidence one person hold the weight that many bring
And I stand for somethin', so I don't fall for anythin'
(F'real dawg)
It's in the air tonight, don't ask who planned it
It's Dilated, move through the city like rapid transit

It's Babu, rapid transit, rapid transit, rapid transit

Everywhere we go now
We the rough, tough and dangerous
The hardest working artist can't hang with us

All around the world
In 80 days from LA
Tell them have nots to have it your way, get it

All the people know now
From NY to PA
ATL, DC to VA, c'mon

Everywhere we go
Competition can't spit
So Dilated run through 'em like rapid transit

Everywhere we go now
Hit the marathon runnin?
Got a hundred done, another hundred's comin?

(More bars)
I got shit to show for it
Wear my heart on my sleeve, just got my jacket over it

Plus I spit that hot shit
A hundred ten percent, less is not an option
I work the angles, no handouts or freebies
So when we in your town, get tickets to see me

This is Nissan truck hop
I bombed the RTD driver's side then hit the bus stop
Create to devastate, scene from New York
Hit the Hollywood sign in LA

And it feels like yesterday that shit amazed me
Cheech Wizard kickin? the lizard, that shit was crazy
In the grass grazin?, now it's kush y'all
Packin? more bowls than college football

But still lively
Poker face, playin? my cards like Phil Ivey
Rock the Dilated, rapid fire how I transmit
Babu!

Move through the city like rapid transit
Move through the city like rapid transit

Everywhere we go now
We the rough, tough and dangerous
The hardest workin' artist can't hang with us

All around the world
In 80 days from LA
Tell them have nots to have it your way, get it

All the people know now
Amsterdam to Iran
Italy, Germany and Japan, c'mon

Everywhere we go
Competition can't spit
So Dilated run through 'em like rapid transit

Everywhere we go now
We the rough, tough and dangerous
The hardest workin' artist can't hang with us

All around the world
In 80 days from LA
Tell them have nots to have it your way, get it

All the people know now
MIA to the Bay, the T Dot, ST and UK , c'mon
Competition can't spit
So Dilated run through 'em like rapid transit

Everywhere we go now
That's right, everywhere we go it's all love, Dilated People
Whenever we in Detroit, Hawaii, Texas
Las Vegas or Phoenix, Minnesota

You know what I'm sayin'? Connecticut, KC
Definitely St. Louis, Rhode Island
Philly, New England, Canada
You know all my Boston cats

Especially overseas when we go to New Zealand
Or Switzerland or someth'
Croatia, rollin' up a backwood
Out in Sweden and Norway, Jamaica, Africa

Ay, what happened to all my Spanish cats?
You know what I'm sayin', Puerto Rico, Mexico
Phil the Agony, be back man
Dilated People
