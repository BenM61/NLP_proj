Move over bacon there's somethin meatier 
A natural born lover with love to give free to ya 
Meatier, so all you bacon lovers move over 
'Cause I'm so smooth they should call me Blackanova 
I'm not tryin to say that I'm number one 
I'm just a smooth operator that gets the job done 
So, let me lick you from head to toe 
Real slow
'Cause ever since I was young I could keep girls sprung 
Just by the movement of my tongue 
I remember it all started way back 
In umm...Kindergarten!! 
Some played with Lego's, some played with Play-Doh 
But I was feelin girls like a ripe tomato 
And now it's 1990 and you can find me as I dunk 
Lockin up girls like I want 
Yes I got a harem, but I don't share em 
I collect em like Playdium and mmm, you gotta see em 
Because the ladies is all I dream of 
And not even Anita Baker can give sweeter love 
You know why? 

'Cause I can do it right (x4)
Yes I can! 

Step up girls and get somethin to treasure 
And welcome to the Smooth Operator's Palace of Pleasure 
And if you're wonderin if I want it
I got a Kraftmatic with your name written on it 
I reminisce sayin I take em eight to eighty 
But I was just kiddin, no you have to be a lady 
Even if you're too young, with the hypest body 
I just don't go to a Similak party 
So all those of age, we can get intimate 
Bumper to bumper, so you can get your fender bent 
I treat girls just like pastry 
Mmmm tasty! 
Very kinky when it comes to hanky panky 
A well known player, but not for the Yankees 
I won't say I'm the baddest or portray that role 
But I'm up to top two and my father's gettin old 
I'm takin love to a brand new height 
And if lovin girls is wrong I don't want to be right 
'Cause my man Babyface said that it's no crime 
And of course I'll work Diana Ross overtime 
You know why? 

'Cause I can do it right (x4)
Yes I can! 

If I was on the movies I'd frame Roger Rabbit 
Play Spike Lee with Jessica, because she's gotta have it 
But I'm not an actor, I'm just a mack 
That charms girls as I whisper sweet nothings to attract her 
And bring about that feelin of passion 
To have her on my body like modern day fashion 
Layin next to me, in pure ecstasy 
You're like a door and you know that sex the key 
So send your man to the lost and found 
I'm bringin somethin that's world renowned 
In other words - good lovin that's major 
I got girls in more areas than a SkyPager 
Runnin around sayin, "Please me, please me, please me" 
That's why I say it ain't easy 
But I've been able to maintain my status 
With ladies mackin without ifs ands or maybes 
And other players just can't understand it 
And couldn't keep they girls even if they were branded 
I always end up with them on my shelf 
I gotta jump back and kiss myself 
You know why? 

'Cause I can do it right (x4)
Yes I can!
