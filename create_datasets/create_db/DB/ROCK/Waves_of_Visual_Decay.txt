To understand the purpose
I'm embarked upon this life
A constant brief of flashes
Maybe this time I will get it right

The future sees the past
If I fail to conceive
The time has arrived
For killing the past
And come back to life
Come back to life

I need to see before I can believe what I have seen
It's dark an I am cold, all these memories still remains

A sense of fear, am I cynical
Have I failed to conceive
Seeing brief moments in life
Time to erase the past
And come back to life
...come back to life

Round and round I'm turning
In a circle containing myself
Round and round I'm turning
In a circle containing myself

All my cases of improvement
Disappeared without a warning
All my cases of improvement
Disappeared without a warning

If my heart could do the thinking
So my head could relax for a moment
And cope with the feelings
So many words
So fragile minded
My life breaking apart
In so many different stages

With the questions comes the dark
And the voices I hear reflects
When I'm lying all alone in the night
In the shadow cast
Trying to hide the fear
In the shadow cast

Making the images blur
When this strange wave
Drags me into decay
Dreams shattered
As I am drifting away
In the shadow cast
Trying to hide the fear
In the shadow cast

Do you feel the presence
Of this unknown force
Do you feel the waves
That drag you into decay

It's my time to feel the pain
Hoping someone will salvage me
From this wreckage of a mind
The stage is set
Back from when I was a young boy

Round and round I'm turning
In a circle containing myself
Round and round I'm turning
In a circle containing myself
All my cases of improvement
Disappeared without a warning
All my cases of improvement
Disappeared without a warning
W A are N I N G !
Maybe this time, I will get it right
Maybe this time, I will get it... right
