Flight 45, last seen alive on the runway
Leaving for some fun in the hot tropic sun (back next Monday)
And our friends are at the airport
Cousin Bill says, "Enjoy the water sports"
As we fly into the mystery
The film comes on and the Earth recedes
Several hours out - 20 minutes south of Bermuda
The communication's gone - something has to be so wrong
And it must be Jesus calling
The silver ship, the blue sea falling
Death was in that poison wave and in its gulf a fitting grave

The coast guard said they might be found
They know just where the plane went down
