Come on - Joey get out of school
We got places to go
A '57 Lincoln you got a radio that hurts
And the girls like to touch it
Just to find out if it works
But don't look at me
It wasn't me

Joey live on the edge of the corner
Of living on the run
I like to ride in the middle
I'm just tryin' to have some fun
Until the Pirates come
And take me

And I won't need a pilot
Got a pirate who might sail
Somewhere I heard far away
You answer me
So I'm holding on
To your rainbow sleeves

Well, goodbye boys,
Oh my buddy boys,
Oh my sad-eyed Sinatras
It's a cold globe around the sea
You keep the shirt that I bought ya
And I know you'll get the chance to make it
And nothin's gonna stop you
You just reach right out and take it
You say - So long, lonely Avenue
So long lonely avenue

I'll see you there
Wait 'n see
Be lookin' for me
Just like you
Just like me
