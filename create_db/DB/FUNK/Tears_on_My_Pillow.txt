You don't remember me,
But I remember you,
Was not so long ago,
You broke my heart in two
Tears on my pillow
Pain in my head
Caused by you, you

If we could start a new,
I wouldn't hesitate,
I'd gladly take you back
And tempt the hand of fate
Tears on my pillow
Pain in my heart
Caused by you, you

love is not a gadget
Love is not a toy
When you find the one you love
She'll fill your heart with joy

If we could start a new
I wouldn't hesistae
I'd gladly take you back
And tempt the hand of fate
Tears on my pillow
Pain in my heart
Caused by you, you

Hey man, who was that
Hey I know who that was
It was Little Richard
Nah, come on Rick you

If we could start a new
I wouldn't hesitate
I'd gladly take her back
And temp the hands of fate
