I called you up to tell you
I'm about to lose my mind
I've tried my best to reach you
Oh so many times

Carrie, I tell you true girl
You've got me collared, I've been cuffed
You've got a hold on me and I can't get loose
You know I need you so much

And now I hear that you've been cryin'
Well you can come cryin' to me
'Cause I don't want to see you dyin'
Or read your diary

Young girl in love
Make up your mind you're freezin' all of my time
Young girl in love
I've become so attached, will it last?
Young girl in love

So you found yourself a lover
No more nights of loneliness
You gave them all you had to give
With a touch and a tender kiss

Then you found yourself in trouble
It was love or so it seemed
Then he turned his head and walked away
Left you hangin' by your dreams

And now I hear that you've been cryin'
Well you can come cryin' to me
And I don't want to see you dyin'
Or read your diary

Young girl in love
Make up your mind you're freezin' all of my time
Young girl in love
I've become so attached, will it last?
Young girl in love

I understand the troubles
That occur inside your mind
(You can come cryin' to me)
I understand, oh, I understand
The pressure in your precious little mind

Young girl in love
Oh, make up your mind you're freezin' all of my time
Young girl in love
I've become so attached, will it last?

Young girl in love
Oh, make up your mind
Stop wastin' my time
Young girl in love
I've become so attached, will it last?

Young girl in love
(Young girl, young girl, young girl, in love)
Young girl in love
(Young girl, young girl, young girl, in love)
Young girl in love
