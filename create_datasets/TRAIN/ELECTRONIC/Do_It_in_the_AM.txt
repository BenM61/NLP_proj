Pick you up, pick you up
Play me like your favorite song
Lick it up, lick it up
Drink tequila til it's gone
You know I like what you do
You paint the time like I'm blue

Like a glove, like a glove
Gonna fit you like a glove
Drop it down, as it bound
Now this room is showing love
This love is stronger than life
We only run things at night

We only do it in the am
We only do it in the am
We only do it in the am

We only do it in the a to the m
Then we do it again, baby

Get it now, get it now
Gonna show some people how
You impress, you impress
Competition lays the best
Last one's in, first one's out
Baby we ain't the crack

For more seats, for more seats
Everybody wants some peace
Watcha thing, buy a drink
Keep on shining 'til we sink
We got our own little crew
Me ain't following you

We only do it in the am
We only do it in the am
We only do it in the am

We only do it in the a to the m
Then we do it again, baby

No time for chit chat, blah, blah
Let's get down to business, yeah
I don't play around
When the club shuts down
I'm a zombie, how to kill this
Midnight mansion, don't mention
Holiday inn or champion's flashing
Free wired with the far east movement
And frankmusik we party trashy

Get love in the am
Get love in the aam
Get love in the am
Get love in the aam,

Fm, frankmusik, fm, party's movement
Fm!

We only do it in the am
We only do it in the am
We only do it in the am

We only do it in the a to the m
Then we do it again, baby
