You're a sexy socialite
All you do is socialize
And you're always so polite
And your outfits tantalize
When you wanna spend the night
All you do is roll your eyes
They crush on you
(Ooh, they crush on you)

You're a sexy socialite
All you do is socialize
And you're always so polite
And your outfits tantalize
When you wanna spend the night
All you do is roll your eyes
They crush on you
(Ooh, they crush on you)

You're out alone
So young and full of promise
(Young and full of promise)
I could be your boyfriend and your counselor
'Cause the night might damage ya'

You're out alone
So young and full of promise
(Young and full of promise)
I could be your boyfriend and your counselor
'Cause the night might damage ya'

You're a sexy socialite
I wish you were a socialist
Instead of worrying about your name on the list
(You insist)
That you should get in there for free
You're too cool to pay a fee
And the owner is like your family
Somebody help me!

You're a sexy socialite
All you do is socialize
As you make your way to the back of the VIP
Watch out for girls that push
Guys that grab your tush
At any moment they'll make you flip

But you're a sexy socialite
And I guess it pays
'Cause you've been out and about for the last four days
And now everybody knows ya'
They all want to approach ya'
And I can't even catch your gaze

What a shame
It's so lame

You're out alone
So young and full of promise
(Young and full of promise)
I could be your boyfriend and your counselor
'Cause the night might damage ya'

You're out alone
So young and full of promise
(Young and full of promise)
I could be your boyfriend and your counselor
'Cause the night might damage ya'

Women are eyeing me
Their men are buying me
Drinks at the bar
You can't go far
In this society
So why you coming at me, homie
With so much acrimony?
Your testimony's phony
And the truth is you don't know me

You're a sexy socialite
(No I'm not, no I'm not)

You're a sexy socialite
(No I'm not, no I'm not)

You're a sexy socialite
(No I'm not, no I'm not)

You're a sexy socialite
(No I'm not, no I'm not)
