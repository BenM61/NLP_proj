Take a glimpse of the world 
As your vision unfurls
In the words of Monty Burns
"Hello Cruel World" 
This is a place
Once said was great
But make no mistake
It's only fear and hate
That makes the wheels go round
The Trapdoor Sound
That you hear as you hang
As it all goes bang

Life loves a winner
Join the losers and the sinners
In... The Underbelly Town

The Underbelly Town.  
The Underbelly Town.

I can see the faces
Souls of non-sinners
Made unclean
By the rolling of the machine
I see the pressure
From the pages of the TV
They're out to get you
Out to get me.

Fear shakes the hand of the man
As he does what he can
It's the 90's for the family plan
And the woman is led
By the crap she's fed
Convinced by the mirror
That her figure's getting bigger

The Underbelly Town 
The Underbelly Town
Down, yeah
The Underbelly Town

This stuff is never enough...
This stuff is never enough...
This stuff is never enough...
Enough, enough, enough
Is never enough

The Underbelly Town
The Underbelly Town  
Down, yeah
The Underbelly Town

This stuff is never enough... 
This stuff is never enough... 
This stuff is never enough... 
Enough, enough, enough
Is never enough
