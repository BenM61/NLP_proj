Rain, sleepless rain is comin' down again
It's the same, same, same just like you know when
Yes I do.

Oh it's floodin' in the holy land
Oh I'm drownin' like a workin' man...
Oh but there is nowhere else that I would rather be, yeah

One more time...
If you were mine, if you were mine, if you were mine

Over me, rain or shine. I'd be satisfied

Blame, burnin' blame is underneath my skin
Such a shame, shame, shame, shame, wish I knew it then
Yes I do, yes I do

Oh sing another lullaby
Oh I think we need an alibi
Oh but there is nowhere else that I would rather be

One more time
If you were mine, if you were mine, if you were mine

Over me, rain or shine. I'd be satisfied yeah

Rain, tired rain slowin' down again...
But the pain doesn't feel the same like I remember then
Yes I do, yes I do

Oh... it's floodin' in the holy land
Oh... I'm Drownin' like a workin' man
Oh... but there is nowhere else that I would rather be, yeah

One more time...
If your were mine, if you were mine, if you were mine...

Over me, rain or shine
I, I'd be satisfied

You'd be over me, over me
You'd be over me, one more time
Congratulations SongStandin' on the ceiling, it's alright
Suspended by the dreams you seem to lose
You've been floatin' for a while, a while, can't hold on
Standin' on the ceiling, it's alright, it's alright

Somebody is tryin' to get the best of me
Congratulations song
So now your'te flying like you wanna be
Right where you belong

Starin' at the wall like it's window,don't know
Blinded by the dreams you seem to lose.
You've been starin' for a while, knock it down
Starin' at the wall, you don't know, don't know...

Somebody is tryin' to get the best of me
