Let's throw a party, let's invite every body
Let's drop some glasses on the floor
Turn up the noise, have some fun with the neighbor
Let's have them bangin' on the door
We're havin a party, everyone is invited
Welcome to our wedding night
Ring up some friends, and I ask them all over
Let's do this whole thing right

Then we'll turn out the lights, when they've all said goodnight
Let the sweet wine of life ever glow
Turn out the lights, when they've all said goodnight
Let the sweet wine of love overflow

Let's sit down in the streets, with a feeling and dealing
Love gonna crowd us, see the light
And a smile at the window, but they know how we're feeling
Welcome to our wedding night

Yes, we'll turn out the lights, when they've all said goodnight
Let the sweet wine of life ever glow
Turn out the lights, when they've all said goodnight
Let the sweet wine of love overflow

And we'll turn out the lights, when they've all said goodnight
Let the sweet wine of life ever glow
Turn out the lights, when they've all said goodnight
Let the sweet wine of love overflow

Let the sweet wine of love overflow
