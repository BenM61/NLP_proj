Get in where you fit in
And get in where you're feelin'
And get in where you fit in
But don't get caught

And more wine and roses
And crystal clear
It's just smoke in mirrors, around here
Na na na na, na na na na, na na na na

Keep on rollin' high (keep on rollin')
When you feel so alive (When you feel so alive)
Just check and fly
Wait for this moment to arrive

And you're crazy if you wanna be mine
Too careful if you wanna be sure
You love everything that money can buy and
When he is here
The gentleman of the year

Get in where you fit in
Get where your feeling
Get in where you fit in
But don't get lost

In foreign places
Where time's forgot
But just go on dancing 'til the music stops
Na na na na, na na na na, na na na na

Keep on rollin' high (keep on rollin')
When you feel so alive (When you feel so alive)
Just check and fly
Wait for this moment to arrive

And you're crazy if you wanna be mine
Too careful if you wanna be sure
You love everything that money can buy and
When he is here
The gentleman of the year (Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen)
The gentleman of the year (Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen)
Let me go from here

(Where did we go from?)
(Where did we go from?)
(Where did we go from?)
(Where did we go from?)
(Where did we go from?)
(Where did we go from?)

And don't get caught
And don't get caught!
And don't get caught

Don't get
