I'm on a train going nowhere
I ran away to make you care
This ain't my house this ain't your home
Not when I'm feeling this alone

So come on over yeah,
I've waited since you start believin'
Yeah so come on over yeah,
There's no God and I don't really care

Lets run away, get out of here
I got no money and I don't care
This ain't my house this ain't your home
Not when I'm feeling this alone

So come on over yeah,
I've waited since you start believin'
Yeah so come on over yeah,
There's no God and I don't really care, I don't really care

I'm on a train going nowhere
I ran away to make you care
This ain't my house this ain't your home not when I'm feeling this alone

So come on over yeah,
I've waited since you start believin'
Yeah so come on over yeah,
There's no God and I don't really care
