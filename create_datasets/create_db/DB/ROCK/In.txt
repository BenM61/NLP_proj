Wasting this time, trying to play it safe
And trying to cover up what our hearts want to say
We've been hiding these words, we don't have to anymore
'Cause we're standing still
Tell me what we're waiting for

If you're in, I'm in
If you're down, I'm down
Do you want this too?
'Cause I need it now
If you say the word, I'll erase your doubts
I can show you
I can show you
That we don't have to be careful
'Cause my cards are on the table
If you're in, I'm in
If you're down, I'm down
Let's do this
Let's do this
Right now

I know that you're scared, but you don't have to be afraid
'Cause I won't let you down
I'll be there every step of the way
We've been keeping it quiet, but I need to say it out loud
'Cause it's about time to let our walls come down

If you're in, I'm in
If you're down, I'm down
Do you want this too?
'Cause I need it now
If you say the word, I'll erase your doubts
I can show you
I can show you,
That we don't have to be careful
'Cause my cards are on the table
If you're in, I'm in
If you're down, I'm down
Let's do this
Let's do this
Right now

Tell me why, Tell me why we wait so long
When we know, When we know where we belong

If you're in, I'm in
If you're down, I'm down
Do you want this too?
'Cause I need it now
If you say the word, I'll erase your doubts
I can show you
I can show you

If you're in, I'm in
If you're down, I'm down
Do you want this too?
'Cause I need it now
If you say the word, I'll erase your doubts
I can show you
I can show you
That we don't have to be careful
'Cause my cards are on the table
If you're in, I'm in
If you're down, I'm down
Let's do this
Let's do this

If you're in, I'm in
If you're down, I'm down
