Deviate to contemplate
This audio visual opiate
One hundred years from now
Title fights and human rights
We're satellites, you're parasites

Down so low that I bit the ground

Go drum, go dance, sound on sound
All this peace and understanding
Go drum, go dance, round and round
In America yeeooo ay da yeeooo ah

A pocket full of posies and cheap scented roses
Every house should have it's hat on
So in and out and round and round,
Up and down and lost and found
Hey ah ha

Magazines and gasoline
And made in Taiwan Western scenes
Will you hear us in the heart of America?
