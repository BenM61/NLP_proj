All I most, I mostly feel I had a good day 
All I most, I mostly feel I had a good day 
It wasn't that great

But if I start to move it, because I'd rather be 
Getting into wonder, why don't you stay here?
But on the contrary, I live in loneliness
So lonely, so lonely

Come and dance with me, bitter sweet fool
I wanna be your toy, I wanna be your toy
Come and dance with me, bitter sweet fool
I wanna be your toy, I wanna be your toy

All I most, I mostly wish I had a bad way 
All I most, I mostly wish I had a bad way 
That would be so great
I'd be so up for it, you wouldn't slow me down
I always want to put it in another minute
I could run for, though it's all the same 
If you want, we could try today

Come and dance with me, bitter sweet fool
I wanna be your toy, I wanna be your toy
Come and dance with me, bitter sweet fool
I wanna be your toy, I wanna be your toy

(I wanna be your toy, I wanna be your toy)
(I wanna be your toy, I wanna be your toy)
(I wanna be your toy, I wanna be your toy)
(I wanna be your toy, I wanna be your toy)

Come and dance with me, bitter sweet fool
I wanna be your toy, I wanna be your toy
Come and dance with me, bitter sweet fool
I wanna be your toy, I wanna be your toy
