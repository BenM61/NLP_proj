You are the crown of creation
You are the crown of creation
And you've got no place to go

Soon you'll attain the stability you strive for 
In the only way that it's granted 
In a place among the fossils of our time

In loyalty to their kind
They cannot tolerate our minds
In loyalty to our kind
We cannot tolerate their obstruction

Life is change
How it differs from the rocks 
I've seen their ways too often for my liking 
New worlds to gain 
My life is too survive 
And be alive for you 
Aah
