I like that

Once she see the sauce
Now ya know she gotta have it
Let her meet the boss
Put her hands on the package
I know what it costs
'Cause I got a bad habit
Of turning good girls
Like you into a savage

Oh
Turning good girls like you into a savage
Oh 
Turning good girls like you into a savage

I'm a real fucking trapper
Once I set the trap I be fuckin something after
Pick 'em hardly sweet just to run up out 'em faster
She was kinda neat and now she almost a disaster
Oh, I'm a real fucking master
I took her to school and now she taking of like NASA
Used to wait and now a nigga ain't'n gotta ask her
I gave her the tools Now the bitch way badder

Oh no, My god
What have you done?
She doin' things
She never done
I gave her game
She having fun
She starting now
She number one

Once she see the sauce
Now ya know she gotta have it
Let her meet the boss
Put her hands on the package
I know what it costs cause I got a bad habit
Of turning good girls like you into a savage

Oh
Turning good girls like you into a savage
Oh
Turning good girls like you into a savage

We ain't doing nothing basic
We gon' overdue it 'til these motherfuckers hate it
I'ma put it in you and then I want you to take it
And flip it so good everybody wanna taste it
You can tell that you my favorite
I give you the gas and
Now you burning up the pavement
If you ever leave
I'ma probably have to chase it
It took too long to make it and now I can't replace it

Oh no, My god
What have you done
She doin' things
She never done
I gave her game
She having fun
She starting now
She number one

Once she see the sauce
Now ya know she gotta have it
Let her meet the boss
Put her hands on the package
I know what it costs 'cause I got a bad habit
Of turning good girls like you into a savage

Oh
Turning good girls like you into a savage
Oh
Turning good girls like you into a savage
