We fall all down
The road
And we follow down
The avenues

And we hock all
To go round
We don't turn back

I will not ever
Take this for granted
I am forever
In your hands
I will not ever 
Take this for granted
I am forever
In your hands

We scroll it down
The road
And you're have places
To go

But we lost temptation
And stall
We don't turn back

I will not ever 
Take this for granted
I am forever
In your hands

I will not ever
Take this for granted
I am forever
In your hands

Uuuh

I will not ever
Take this for granted
I am forever
In your hands
I will not ever 
Take this for granted
I am forever
In your hands
