I'm the one who stole the stars for you
I'm the fool who lost it all and I'd lose it all again
I'd like to think that your the same as me
But something tells me that your not
Quite lost without me

I should have been a little bit stronger
I should have tried a little bit harder
Or maybe just a tiny bit wiser

Cause we are stars
We are lights
We are golden in the night
We are planets in this sky
Waiting to appear

In your atmosphere
In your atmosphere
In your atmosphere

Your the one stole the sun from me
And you're the fool that took the fall
And you blamed on me

I should have been a little bit stronger
I should have tried a little bit harder
Or maybe just a tiny bit wiser

Cause we are stars
We are lights
We are golden in the night
We are planets in this sky
Waiting to appear

And we are stones
We're all but dust
Green to brown
Gold to rust
Just a moon
Breaking up
In your atmosphere
In your atmosphere
In your atmosphere
Your atmosphere

Cause we are stones
We're all but dust
Green to brown
Gold to rust
Just a moon
Breaking up
In your atmosphere

I'm the one who stole the stars for you
