You allude to 
Everything negative there was 
Making out that's all we had 
Couldn't you believe that 
There would be an end to it 
All the good could be that bad 

There is just one thing to say 
There's a lesson here to learn, 
Can you use it in any way? 
You are nothing without my love 

Couldn't care if you 
Decide today and run away 
Always said we'd be apart 
Wouldn't care if you begin, 
Your life with someone else 
You'd be back before you start 

There is just one thing to say 
There's a lesson here to learn, 
Can you use it in any way? 

You are nothing without, 
You are nothing without, 
You are nothing without my love 

Laissez-faire approach is all 
You ever gave to me 
Either way you didn't care 
Maybe if you had the honesty you need to see 
I'll wager everything you wouldn't dare 

You are nothing without, 
You are nothing without, 
You are nothing without my love
