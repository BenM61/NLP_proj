My body's burning like a flame that's blue

It's time for action and I want it from you.
Slice me nice - slice me nice.
My heart is beating to the rhythm of love

I need you
baby
like cold hands need a glove.
Slice me nice - slice me nice.

I'm like a cake that wants to be baked

I'm like a pie made for hungry guys.
My body's burning like a flame that's blue

It's time for action
baby
got me and you.
Slice me nice - slice me nice.

SLICE - slice me nice
SLICE - slice me nice

S L I see E - slice me nice
S L I see E - slice me nice

Slice me nice.
My body's burning like a flame that's blue

S L I see E - slice me nice

SLICE - slice me nice
SLICE - slice me nice
