Good God, you said 
Is that the only thing you care about 
Splitting up the money 
And share it out 
The cake's being eaten 
Straight through the mouth 
Poison Poised to come back in 
Season For all the ones who lack 
Reason 

Measure by measure, drop by drop 
And pound for pound, we're taking stock 
Of all the treasure still unlocked 
The love you found must never stop 

The king is dead 
And long live the people who aim above 
All the simple stuff never understood 
Like right from bad and wrong from good 
Deny That you were ever tempted by the 
Lie That there's an answer in the 
Sky 

Measure by measure, drop by drop 
And pound for pound, we're taking stock 
Of all the treasure still unlocked 
The love you found must never stop 

Oh, oh Oh, oh Oh, oh Oh, oh

Never stop Never stop
Never stop Never stop
Never stop Never stop
Never stop Never stop Never stop

Measure by measure, drop by drop 
And pound for pound, we're taking stock 
Of all the treasure still unlocked 
The love you found must never 

Measure by measure, drop by drop 
And pound for pound, we're taking stock 
Of all the treasure still unlocked 
The love you found must never stop

(Stop) Never stop
(Stop stop) Never stop (Stop) 
Never stop (Stop stop) 
Never stop (Stop stop stop) 
Never stop (Stop stop stop) 
Never stop
