In the life we live as thugs
Everybody fuckin' wit' us so can't you see
It's hard to be a man
Ridin' wit' my guns in hand

Why explain the game? Niggas ain't listenin'
Stuck in positions if victims can't stand the heat
Then stay the f*ck out the kitchen
Have these bust as switchin', lookin' at me mean
Itchin', givin' suckas plenty space
Have these bitch niggas snitchin'

Where are we now? Guns found daily
The feds surely hope that they could finally nail me for sellin' dope
They backwards, make tracks burst whenever I rap
Attack, words bein' known to explode on contact
Extreme at times blinded by my passion and fury
Look at me laugh at my competition's flashin' my jewelry

You'd stay silent if you niggas knew me truly effective
The shit you heard ain't do me justice got a death wish, bitch
Run up, face me and trace wit' an infared beam
It seems niggas ain't recognize my team
Ain't nobody holdin' you back explode the track to confetti
Unload it, 'cause niggas ain't ready the life of an outlaw

In the life we live as thugs
Everybody fuckin' wit' us so can't you see
It's hard to be a man
Ridin' wit' my guns in hand

Code 3, attack formation pull out your pistols
Keep an eye out for the devils 'cause they itchin' to get you
Mercy to this madman screamin' kamikaze in tongue
Automatic gunfire makin' all my enemies run
Who should I call when I'm shot and bleedin'
Indeed the possibility has part a chase in cream

Dope got me hatin' fiends, schema wit' my team, just a chosen few
My foes victim of explosives come closer exhale the fumes
We got memories fadin' fast a slave for cash
Accelerate, mash, blast, then dash
Don't look now how you like it, raw

Niggas ain't ready for the wrath of the outlaws never surrender
Death is for a son to stay free I'm thugged out
F*ck the world 'cause this is how they made me
Scarred but still breathin' believe in me and you could see the victory
A warrior with jewels can you picture me?
Life of and outlaw

In the life we live as thugs
Everybody fuckin' wit' us so can't you see
It's hard to be a man
Ridin' wit' my guns in hand

City under siege it's like I can't even breathe
I'm from the state of car thieves G, deep from the street
Plenty beef I play for keeps, arrange the whole crime scene
Mobb Deep this nigga from behind tryin' to creep

No half's wit' no straps, jack it's on to bounce back
And an ounce so fat, they snatch my style [Incomprehensible]
Get this grip wit hollows to get cha snip wit' clippers
Get the picture? I wrote my life down like a scripture

And I'm still on lost in the land of the lonely
Where ain't nobody holy a matter of a fact, we unholy
Everybody livin' solely for themselves too
[Incomprehensible] on a land hell
Somebody need me you know we lost hope and we needin' it

Wit' the evil it's forever but it might be low down, scandalous
Like a tramp is all for the street fame on how to be managed
To plan shit 6 months in advanced to what we plotted
Approved to go on sole and now I got it

Crack my window knowin' they'd love to catch Kastro sleepin'
Attach a strap under my pillow and a hand like we freakin'
Creepin' deep into morning peepin' out the weak
While they yawnin' and let my cloud speak for it's self

No doubt outlaw, outta my mind, outta time you're all blind
Some kind of life of mine Kato don't mind
Findin' it funny, matter of fact, 'cause it is
Perhaps finally I look at that true over the years as an outlaw

Eh, Noble
What's up nigga
Would you die for me, nigga?
Hell yeah
Would you kill for me?
On my grandmother, nigga
Ah yo
What's up
Let's ride on them stupid bitches right now
Watch out

Well, now they all say they roaches and parasites
Snakes and all they might thug life break night
Drink till we fist fight life or death
But you can't win with a vest
But there won't be no breathing for the reason
Punk bitch on your breath

I see day is dark and I admit it's dark
So chase ?
?
And yo, Makaveli, give me them bullets that was left for Po's belly
And let me bust back to them niggas till they all sweaty
