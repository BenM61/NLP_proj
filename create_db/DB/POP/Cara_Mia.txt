Who's gonna love you?
Who's gonna take my place and stand by your side?
Kiss you and hold you
Console you when you cry?

I'll always love you, I know
Baby, don't go

Come closer, cara cara mia
Cara cara mia, love is all we need
I swear I'm never gonna leave you, cara cara mia
You're the one for me
When someone loves like I do
Dreams can come true
So tell me, tell me now
Oh, cara cara mia, cara cara mia
How can you leave me now?

Make me believe you
So hard for me to understand what went wrong
I've been so certain
Our love was always strong

Baby, we can't move apart
You're breaking my heart

Come closer, cara cara mia
Cara cara mia, love is all we need
I swear I'm never gonna leave you, cara cara mia
You're the one for me
When someone loves like I do
Dreams can come true
So tell me, tell me now
Oh, cara cara mia, cara cara mia
How can you leave me now?

We can be happy again
Don't you feel that it's burning inside, 
Burning inside?
We can't give up on each other
I want us to try
Before we say goodbye

Come clo-ser, cara cara mia
Cara cara mia, love is all we need
I swear I'm never gonna leave you, cara cara mia
You're the one for me! 
When someone loves like I do
Dreams can come true
So tell me, tell me now
Oh, cara cara mia
Can you leave me now?
Oh
Cara cara mia
Can you leave me now?
