Old Watertown
Nothing much happenin'
Down on Main
'Cept a little rain

Old Watertown
Everyone knows
The perfect crime
Killin' time

And no one's goin' anywhere
Livin's much too easy there
It can never be a lonely place
When there's the shelter of familiar faces
Who can say
It's not that way

Old Watertown
So much excitement
To be found
Hangin' round

There's someone standing in the rain
Waiting for the morning train
It's gonna be a lonely place
Without the look of your familiar face
But who can say
It's not that way
