You let her go
She does not want to be with you
She told me so
She does not know what to do

Yes, she knows
She must try to keep you
From under her skin
But it's not been that easy
Because you just won't give in

And I know
I would let go
I know, I know

I know it's wrong
It can't  possibly go on
She can't drop a friend
Just because you say so

I love her more than you do
Yet I can't get near her
It isn't fair that you should
Say who can and can't see her

And I know
I would let go
I know, I know

She has a mind of her own
And she's going to use it
She told you to step down
So you'll have to do it
Maybe you'll try it again
But it won't work out that I know
You can't push anymore
You'll just have to let her go

And I know I would let go
Let her go
And I know I would let go
Let her go
