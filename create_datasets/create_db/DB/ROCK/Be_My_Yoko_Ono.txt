If there's someone you can live without, then do so
And if there's someone you can just shove out, well do so

You can be my Yoko Ono
You can follow me wherever I go
Be my, be my, be my, be my Yoko Ono, whoa oh

Isn't it beautiful to see two people so much in love?
Bare naked as two virgins hand in hand, and hand in hand in love
Now that I'm far away it doesn't seem to me to be such a pain
To have you hanging off my ankle like some kind of ball and chain

You can be my Yoko Ono
You can follow me wherever I go
Be my, be my, be my, be my Yoko Ono, whoa oh (be my Yoko)

Oh no, here we go
Our life is just one big pun
Ono, here we go as Yoko sings woo ho ho ho ho ho

I know that when I say this
I may be stepping on pins and needles (ho ho whoa)
But I don't like all these people slagging her for breaking up the Beatles
(Don't blame it on Yokey)
I mean if I was John and you were Yoko I would gladly give up musical genius
Just to have you as my very own personal Venus

(To doo to to to, hit it)
You can be my Yoko Ono (oh, whoa oh)
You can follow me wherever I go
Be my, be my, be my, be my Yoko Ono, whoa oh

Be my, be my, be my, be my, be my Yoko Ono, whoa
Be my, be my, be my, be my, be my Yoko Ono, whoa
Be my, be my, be my, be my, be my Yoko Ono, whoa whoa oh
