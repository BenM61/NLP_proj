Einstein
You say wine time
I say high time
We say dance

I got my juke box playing in the back, girl
And it's rockin'
Because I feel like I wanna rock the block, girl
No talking

I like to see what you can do
When you drop your guards and get loose
I wanna make you feel faint
And be your main man rockin' 'round the block, girl
Non-stoppin'

I'm kinda hot, hey, come and see
You don't have to be told, I've got a dance degree
I'm always smokin', I don't be jokin'
I'll leave you chokin', I say ooh, all I wanna know is

Ooh, you, all I wanna know is
Can-u-dance
Ooh, you, all I wanna know is
Can-u-dance
Ooh, do it like this, ooh

Good God

Now I'm a stone cold rocker from The Deele y'all
No jivin'
What I need is someone to get the feel y'all
And ride it

I wanna block you in a corner
Make your temperature a little warmer
Now do you think that you can hang
I'll work you hard till you think you're in a tank, girl
With no goggles

I'm kinda hot, hey, come and see
You don't have to be told, I've got a dance degree
I don't be jokin', I'm always smokin'
I'll leave you chokin', I say, ooh, all I wanna know is

Ooh, you, all I wanna know is
Can-u-dance
Ooh, you, all I wanna know is
Can-u-dance
Ooh, do it like this, ooh

Good God

Einstein
You say wine time
I say high time
We say dance now

Deele, sing

Ooh, you, all I wanna know
Ooh, you, all I wanna know
Kayo, play
Ooh, you, all I wanna know
Ooh, you, all I wanna know

I say now, ooh, you, all I wanna know is
Can-u-dance
I say now, ooh, you, all I wanna know is
Can-u-dance

Ooh, you, all I wanna know is
Everybody, ooh, you, all I wanna know is
