Now I don my electric axe
I'm gonna lay you on your back
All psyched and ready to go
Take you to hell and won't say hello

Walk with me through the black house
What a wild trip You're such a louse
Feel my power as it prevails
Our of the walls flows true belief

When in doubt what do you do
Do you know how to see it through
Never in your life will he forgive
The wasting of your soul that he once gave

Oh no!

Do you know my name I doubt if you do
But you'd be surprised if I told it to you
My looks are deceiving I'm not what I seem
For I've got more power than you may belief

Ah take me
And its so relentless oh yeah
So relentless
