 

(Verse 1)
On fo' seven, the helicopter lights nearly blind me
In the south east streets is were you might find me
True bandana, my scanner, and my pager
In the blue 1994 one blazer
And I'm the one all the ho's want to get wit
Jack Daniel punch and the indo spliff
You don't like the way I kick shit
You can get the dick six fo' three wheelin
Mobbin to the picnic
But somethin's missin, wake up and stop dreamin
Tyshe let's take a ride to the coast to get a demon
Bring it back to Gomper's Park before two
And everybody know what the f*ck we gon' do

We gon smoke a dip, all of it
not a little bit (we gon smoke a sherm stick)
We gon smoke a dip, all of it
not a little bit, we gon smoke a dip (sherm stick)

(Verse 2)
In the men's bathroom, fool let me have room
So I light it right, so it won't go boom
I took fo' hard hits, and passed it to the next man
Now it seems like I got powers like the X-men
Sittin on the curb, for four fuckin hours dog
Thinkin bout my homie in the pen, lil boss hog
Damn near dead, bout to head to the tilt
My homegirl woke me up, wit a carton of milk
I'm glad I didn't get caught slippin when I was sleepin
On them fools on the otherside who call themselve's creepin
But see sucka, gangs a nation crew
And everybody knows what the f*ck we gon do

We gon smoke a dip, all of it
not a little bit (we gon smoke a sherm stick)
We gon smoke a dip, all of it
not a little bit, we gon smoke a dip (sherm stick)

Everybody that like to f*ck, throw ya hands up, we gon smoke a dip
Everybody that like to f*ck, throw ya hands up, we gon smoke a dip
(Sherm stick)

(Verse 3)
I flips the ill gangsta shit on the worst day
Bitches sayin go bullet lock it's ya birthday
My homie b.k., threw a party and we got there late
You know I had to make them ho's wait
And when I arrived, the whole shit was in a trance
niggaz gettin bong out, muthafucka a dance
Haha, gettin ready for the next batch
My homie's asshole naked, doin the muthafuckin cabbage patch
niggaz throwin up, it's a part of growin up
My piss test is straight, it ain't shit showin up
So duck, cause the next busta might be you
Now all y'all niggaz know what my crew bout to do

We gon smoke a dip, all of it
not a little bit (we gon smoke a sherm stick)
We gon smoke a dip, all of it
not a little bit, we gon smoke a dip (sherm stick)

Everybody that like to f*ck, throw ya hands up, we gon smoke a dip
Everybody that like to f*ck, throw ya hands up, we gon smoke a dip

Yeah, this for y'all niggaz out there, and y'all bitches out there
Smokin that border, rest in peace big tray dogg, much love loc
