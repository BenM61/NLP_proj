Hip Hip Hooray
I'm a pop star 
Hip Hip Hooray 
No clouds in my sky 
Premieres and stocks and shares 
Paradise on ice 
So much fun 
I'm the chosen one 

Hip Hip Hooray 
I got a gold disc 
Hip Hip Hooray 
I'm honored and I'm thrilled 
No one ever mentioned that I'm pickin' up the bill 
C'est la vie 
The drinks are on me 

Everybody loves me money 
Just like on TV 
Everybody says they really care 
Everybody loves me money 
Just you wait and see 
So much fun 
I'm the chosen one 

Hip Hip Hooray 
I've got diamonds 
Hip Hip Hooray 
I've got houses, boats and cars 
Life is getting tougher for us daring superstars 
That charity, it depends on me 

[Chorus x 2]

Hip Hip Hooray 
I'm on the dole now 
Not hip today 
My rent is overdue 
Scavengers and managers still waiting to be fed 
The girls don't cling 
and the phone don't ring 
no it don't, no it don't 
Everybody, Everybody Every body loves me 

[Chorus x 3]
