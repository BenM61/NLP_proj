Are you lost? 
Do you find life turning out 
Not quite the way you planned? 
Come around stay awhile 
that's OK That's alright 
Couldn't get to sleep so talk about it. 

Let's talk about it right now. 
Here it comes on my head again 
I guess I'm born to be the long lost friend. 

Long Lost Friend 
Are you cold? Is there no place better, safer, friendlier than this? 
Call me up, I'm alone. 
That's OK, That's alright 
Rather it be me than go without it. 

So don't think about it right now. 
Here it comes on my head again 
I guess I'm born to be the long lost friend. 

Long lost friend 
I've given ballast 
Held you up when you were falling down 
What happened when I'm not around? 
Friend? 
Friend? 
Long Lost Friend
