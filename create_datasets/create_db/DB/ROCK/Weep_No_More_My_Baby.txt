Weep no more my baby I'm a comin' back to you
Weep no more my baby your lonely days are through
Oh oh oh wipe away those teardrops cause I've been lonely too
Well weep no more my baby I'm a comin' home to you

Dry those big brown eyes my baby I've been gone too long
This time I don't mean maybe I know I know I done you wrong
Yeah yeah weep no more my baby your lonely days're through
Weep no more my baby I'm a comin' comin' home to you

Come out and smile for me my baby your tears are making me so sad
I can't stay away no longer you're the only love I've ever had
Oh weep no more my baby I'm a comin' home to you
Weep no more my baby your lonely days are through
And I'm a comin' comin' home to you yeah I'm a comin' comin' home to you
I said I was a comin' comin' home to you
