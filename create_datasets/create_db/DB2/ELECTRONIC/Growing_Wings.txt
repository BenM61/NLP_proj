Have you ever faced an ocean
Though you hadn't any notion how to swim 
But you jumped in anyway
Have you ever kissed a lover
Knowing that his heart was broken and damaged
But you held him anyway?

Leap of faith
Growing wings
On the way down
Before you hit the ground
Leap of faith
Growing wings
On the way down
Before you hit the ground

Have you wandered in the desert
While the sands were ever changing but the winds
Guide you anyway
Have you spoken in a language
That you've never heard before but your memory
Understands it anyway

Leap of faith
Growing wings
On the way down
Before you hit the ground
Leap of faith
Growing wings
On the way down
I'm growing wings now
I'm growing wings now
I'm growing wings

Leap of faith
Growing wings
On the way down
Before you hit the ground
Leap of faith
Growing wings
On the way down
Before you hit the ground

Leap of faith
Growing wings
On the way down
Before you hit the ground
Leap of faith
Growing wings
On the way down
Before you hit the ground
