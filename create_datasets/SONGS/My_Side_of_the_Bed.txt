I want to show you the picture I drew
When I was on the phone talking to you
I made a heart and I colored it red
Cause I want you here on my side of the bed

I've been dreamin' since I was born
And in my dreams I see eyes like yours
I'll be the pillow where you lay your head
If you'll come and sleep on my side of the bed

Lay down
The sheets are white like the moon my love
Dream with me in my room
Lay down

I know you hurt, I feel the pain
Take my hand and come out of the rain
We all need to be comforted
You can get yours on my side of the bed
