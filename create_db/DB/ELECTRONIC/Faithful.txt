All Rise

A reading fom the book of Sense Live Song 55 Verse 1, I ran 25 miles blind through the wicked terrain but due to my superior conditioning I maintained and survived my deadly mission. It's crazy the world we live in there's no doubting, But Armageddon it ain't coming in thi year 2000. Me, I know 2000 million armies sprouting, spirits arousing, kids from the burbs and public housing. With 10 worlds to dwell from Buddhahood to hell. Miguel Angel, it seems my poppa named me very well. It's necessary that we spread the love to every. If you touch the life of one, you touch th lives o plenty. So people, let the truth be known, we own the will and the way and so tell me what's the delaying. These are the latter days and benefits will be received. But only for the faithful who truly believe.

chorus
This is for the faithful who truly believe that Babylon is gone, you got everything yu need in your pal. So sing songs of thanks and praise. These are the fatter days, the latter days

When I appear I be the natural 4 divisions of the year; spring, summer, fall, winter, lend me your ear, got this mic her about to start a renaissance, unite all the colors of the world like Benetton. Keep the faith and move on, evolve, don't let it dissolve. Everybody sees the breaks, problems were made to be solved, the power's in your palm, the future's in your hand, open with possibilities, focus, why be afraid? Enter the unknown. Free where life gives you surprises, surprises give you life and your spirit energizes, reaching new horizons, promoting the uprising, rising above cuz el demonio be snuffin. So people, let the truth be known, we own the will and the way and so tell me what's the delaying. These are the latter days and benefits will be received. But only for the faithful who truly believe.

chorus

We are the light of the world. May our light shine before men. That they may see the good that we do. And give glory to God.
