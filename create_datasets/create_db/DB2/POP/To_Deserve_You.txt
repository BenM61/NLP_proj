I see so many golden women;
When they walk their feet don't touch the ground.
How I want, how I want to deserve you.
But me, I'm always out of rhythm.
My needs too demanding, too proud.
How I want, how I want to deserve you.

I didn't want you to see me like this.
The light of the dawn can be cruel.
How I want, how I want to deserve you.
And if I could be granted a wish,
I'd shine in your eye like a jewel.
How I want to deserve you.

I would die for you.
Could you ever love me that much? 
How I want, how I want to deserve you.
Yes, you tell me this,
And I want to believe that it's true.
Aah, how I want, how I want to deserve you.

I didn't want you to see me like this.
I'm weak and I fight like a fool.
How I want, how I want to deserve you.
And if I could be granted a wish,
I'd shine in your eye like a jewel.
How I want to deserve you.

If I could be your angel
I'd trade in my arms for some wings
To keep you close to me.
And if I could trade my voice
For the silence I know that you need.
Ah, how I want, how I want to deserve you.

I didn't want you to see me like this.
So frightened of losing so soon.
How I want, how I want to deserve you.
And if I've caught our love in a grip,
Just tell me and I'll shake it loose.
How I want to deserve you.

Oh, na na na na na.
Oh, oh.
How I want to deserve you.
Na na na na na na na.
Whoa, oh.
How I want to deserve you.
Oh, I want to deserve you.
Na na na na na na
