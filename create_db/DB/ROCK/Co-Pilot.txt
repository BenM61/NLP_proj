Everybody says that you're no good 
I don't pay attention though it doesn't matter 
Though I know it should 
I don't pay attention so what's the use when it never ends and you're singular 
It's true 
So much for them who cares about my friends
Be my co-pilot 
Come be in my dream 
You looked so beautiful there 
Just like the part of you that makes a part of you 
Seem everybody tries so hard to bring me down 
I don't pay attention though it doesn't matter 
I can hardly hear a sound and I don't pay attention 
Because number one I'm good with you and the way you look at me is number two 
So what else could I do 
Be my co-pilot come be in my dream 
You looked so beautiful there just like the part of you that makes a part of me 
Seem seem like a one way track 
I feel like I could float away 
So what's the use when it never ends and you're singular it's true
So much for them who cares about my friends 
Be my co-pilot come be in my dream 
You looked so beautiful there just like the part of you that makes a part of me 
Seem take a ride co-pilot shimmer on in my dream
