Baby girl I was dead wrong for days I would stay gone
Telling you one thing doing another thing
But the lies, finally caught up up to me
Left you with no choice but to leave
Too slick for my own good
Never thought that I would
Get caught out there
But I did and I blew it
Lost sight of what was important to me
It was you, and now I can plainly see
Life was so much better (with you in it)
I know I messed up (and were finished)
I couldn't control myself, and now I'm alone and by myself
Because (I couldn't get into you)
And I will (there was something I could do) to get you back
All I had to do was act right, instead I was acting like
You was just another girl
But the truth is I love you girl
I know the chances are slim to none
And I probably don't deserve another one
Life was so much better (with you in it)
I know I messed up (and were finished)
I couldn't control myself
Now I'm alone and by myself
Because (because I couldn't get into you)
I will (there was something I could do to get you back)
Life was so much better (with you in it)
I know I messed up (and were finished)
Couldn't control myself
Now I'm alone and by myself
Because (because I couldn't get into you)
I will (there was something I could do) to get you back
'Cause I want you to take me back
The way I did you can't expect you
(Girl that me it's in my past)
All the times I use to neglect you
Come back and bite me in the ass
'Cause I was chasing what I already had in you
My life was better (with you in it)
And I know I know I messed up (and were finished)
I couldn't control myself now I'm alone and by myself
Because (I couldn't get into you)
And I wish there was something I could do (to get you back)
Life was so much better (with you in it)
I know I messed up (and were finished)
I couldn't control myself now I'm alone
And by myself
Because (I couldn't get into you)
I wish only there was something I could do (to get you back)
Yeah yeah yea yeah yeah
Would you take me back would take me back
