Little girl your to young to settle down
You fall in love with the first man 
You throw your arms around 
Don't you know there a great big world
For you to see

Baby in your arms at 17 
You spend your life wondering what you might have been
'Cause love has turned to hate 
But that ain't nothing new

What you gonna do when life really gets you down 
When the baby in your arms makes that crying sound
When the loneliness of love makes you cry no more
There a rumor on the streets that you can have it all
(You can have it all)

Little boys grow into wiser men 
Forgetting all the tears you cried for them
Remembering is the only way of getting threw
Tell me that you hurt no one that you love
Cause darling that was never good enough 
But even when the dreams are gone 
Am here for you

What you gonna do when life really gets you down 
When the baby in your arms makes that crying sound
When the loneliness of love makes you cry no more
There a rumor on the streets that you can have it all
(You can have it all)

What you gonna do when life really gets you down 
When the baby in your arms makes that crying sound
When the loneliness of love makes you cry no more
There a rumor on the streets that you can have it all

Have it have it have it all

Have it have it have it all

Have it have it have it all

Have it have it have it all

Have it have it have it all

Have it have it have it all

Have it have it have it all
(All)

Don't you know to fall in love 

Don't you know to fall in love 

Don't you know to fall in love 

Don't you know  to fall in love 

Have it 
Have it
