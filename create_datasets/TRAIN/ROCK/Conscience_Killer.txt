I'm a constant sinner
A conscience killer
I'm a righteous heartache, never gonna let you get close to mine
I'm a punk every time, give me a little room and I'll spit in your eye

Cause it don't mean all that much does it boy
We never really had a choice
No it don't mean all that much to us boy
We never really had a choice
We're conscience killers

I'm a red-blooded sickness
There was no way around it
I'm a fine line teaser, never been nothing but a cheater
I'm a son of the night, give a little room and I'll spit in your eye

Cause it don't mean all that much does it boy
We never really had a choice
No it don't mean all that much to us boy
We never really had a choice
We're conscience killers
Don't want no conscience at all

I'm nails
I'm a knife
I'm a preacher with a gun, I'm a one man lie
I'm a king
I'm a ruse
I'm born again with no life to lose

Cause it don't mean all that much does it boy
We never really had a choice
No it don't mean all that much to us boy
We never really had a choice
We're conscience killers
Don't want no conscience at all
