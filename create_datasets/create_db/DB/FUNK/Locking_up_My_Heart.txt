I'm puttin' up my guard
I'm lockin' up my heart
Tellin' Cupid to pass by me
'Cause all love ever brought me was misery

Hello loneliness, goodbye love
I'm tired of being abused and being misused
I've had my share of romance, no more for me
I'm lockin' up my heart and throwin' away the key

Lockin' up (lockin' up, lockin' up)
Said I'm gonna throw away the key (throw away the key)
I'm lockin' up (lockin' up)
'Cause all love ever brought me was misery

I don't want (don't want) nobody to love me
Leave me alone and let me be lonely
This way I'll know just where I stand
I'll never have to worry about love again

Lockin' up (lockin' up, lockin' up)
Said I'm gonna throw away the key (throw away the key)
I'm gonna save myself from all this misery

Lockin' up (lockin' up, lockin' up)
Said I'm gonna throw away the key
I'm lockin' up (lockin' up my heart)
I'm lockin' up (lockin' up my heart)

Yeah yeah yeah (lockin' up my heart)
Yeah yeah yeah (lockin' up my heart)
Yeah yeah yeah (lockin' up my heart)
Yeah yeah yeah (lockin' up my heart)
Yeah yeah yeah (lockin' up my heart)
