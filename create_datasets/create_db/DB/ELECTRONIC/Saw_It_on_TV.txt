Anorectic female speaking philosophy
Mothers interfering in everyone's privacy
Politicians smiling over controversy
Everybody's involved in a conspiracy

Saw it on TV
Saw it on TV
The way my life could be
The way my life should be

People jump into conclusions so mindlessly
Suffocate the ones they love over jealousy
Every single one night stand leads to pregnancy
Everybody's married, still everybody's free

Saw it on TV
Saw it on TV
The way my life could be
The way my life should be

Could you help me to be real?
I'm not sure if I can feel
Would you help me, take this low
Turn it into a late night show

Saw it on TV
