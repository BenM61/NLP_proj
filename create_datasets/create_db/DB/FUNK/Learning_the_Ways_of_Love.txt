Learning the ways of love
I never thought it could feel so good
Yet hurt so much
Learning the ways of love

Learning the ways of love
The feeling when our bodies touch
The sudden rush
Learning the ways of love

All the emotions that I can't control
The fire burning deep inside my soul

Knowing it's you
And only you I'm dreaming of
Never gonna stop
Never gonna stop learning the ways of love
Learning the ways of love

Learning the ways of love
Wanting you more than anyone
I've met before
Learning the ways of love

Learning the ways of love
And knowing each time we touch
It opens one more door
Learning the ways of love

All the emotions that I can't control
The fire burning deep inside my soul

Knowing it's you
And only you I'm dreaming of
Never gonna stop
Never gonna stop learning the ways of love
Learning the ways of love

Never knew how much I missed
Learning the ways of love
Never knew it could feel like this
Learning the ways of love

Knowing it's you
And only you I'm dreaming of
Never gonna stop
Never gonna stop learning the ways of love
Learning the ways of love

Never knew how much I missed
Learning the ways of love
Never knew it could feel like this
Learning the ways of love
