Yea Yea Com on
Man I just do what the doers do
Com on Yea you heard it man
I just do what the doers do

Now I been makin' hits since under age
Contract intact can't be underpaid
This ain't a game I ain't come to play
Don't front for me I ain't from the A

Don't you want to hear what I come to say
This just the kid you know me from before
Prices go up when I come in the store
I'm in another island in the bungalow

The bee suit down to my underclothes
Ate like a cat that was undersold
I give, get it back in a hundred fo'
I'm feared like man that was from the ro'

And y'all now that I will bring you out
And when I'm talkin you don't know a thing about
Bring Modenas out take a scenic route
Bettin' against me is bound to clean you out

This is for all of my people
Who stood beside me and still believed
Drop top cars and suvs
G5 flights and shoppin' sprees
This is where you want to be
This is la familia

It's hard to get low in the 3-6-0 spider
License plate all the chicks know
Cats walk around buffed up like a beach guys
But they don't put no fear in these eyes

Beside I'm just here to teach lives
Girl walk around and try to give me the slide
The ice on my arm it gave me all away
I rolled up the tent top up and rolled away

I smell like money lit though the state
Go in my closet first to throw away 
I'm never lost I already know the way
If I need it 'fore tonight I get it 'fore today

I'm God made I took 5 years part laid
Home pool arcade and it's all paid
What's save I spent a third on an upgrade
Then bought palm trees 'cause I ain't have enough shade

This is for all of my people
Who stood beside me and still believed
Drop top cars and suvs
G5 flights and shoppin' sprees
This is where you want to be
This is la familia

And when the record plays
What will the haters say
Oh don't you be afraid 'cause I'm your allaby
So when I'm drivin' by

Don't try to analyze
Because a him I'm a still be fly
And this a lullaby

Come on now
You know my flow I'm in and out
Non-guilty I ain't gotta buy the trout
Couple a critics but I ain't gonna stop now

I got a plane to catch to be in Moscow
I'm on jets they doin' sky mouths
So I see why the people so hostile
There's now drama it's more honor

I'm wanted in the world like I was Osama
This is no exaggeration
Why's these people so mad and Mase and uh

This is for all of my people
Who stood beside me and still believed
Drop top cars and suvs
G5 flights and shoppin' sprees
This is where you want to be
This is la familia
