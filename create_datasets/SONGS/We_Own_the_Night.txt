We own the night, night, night, night, night, night
We own the night, night, night, night, night, night

We're burning with the stars
We shine so bright
Like Jupiter and Mars
We own the night
Keep running with the fires
This time is ours
We're dancing through the clouds
We own the night

Something in the air makes me feel so good tonight
Release the energy and take it for a ride
Make it to a run speed, pushing it to the edge
I am supernova and tonight I wanna forget!

If it feels good do it
Wanna fall off and do it
Put your body into it
We own the night,night,night

We're burning with the stars
We shine so bright
Like Jupiter and Mars
We own the night
Keep running with the fires
This time is ours
We're destined through the clouds
We own the night

If it feels good do it
On the floor do it
Put your body into it
We own the night,night,night

Shinning, we shinning with desire
Shinning, we shinning with desire
Shinning, we shinning with desire
Shinning with desire
