Call me Joeboy Police
 
Do what you want
What you want with me
Tie me up
Kick me around
Put me in a cab and send me downtown
Call me a new name
And Think of something good
 
Call me Joeboy Police
 
It's too white
it's all steel
It's Hissing in your neon
It's hissing in your wheels
Joeboy Joeboy the electronic ghost
I'm on live color TV from coast to coast
 
Call me Joeboy Police
 
I'm just an idea on your little screen
Is my hair too blue?
Is my skin too green?
Take me off your screen
Put me in your bed
Tie my picture around your head
 
Call me Joeboy Police
 
Take me rape me
Pour me in your food
Take my picture while you're sitting in the nude
I'm everywhere i'm everything
Pick up the phone and you can hear me sing
 
Call me Joeboy Police
 
It's too white
It's a steel
It's hissing in your neon
It's hissing in your wheels
Joeboy the electronic ghost
I'm on live color TV from coast to coast
 
Call me Joeboy Police
