Seems like you're always a million miles away
As far as I'm concerned that's where you can stay

But all the time I'm reminded

Used to be a time we had a lot in common
But now as far as I can see you got something coming

And all the time you're behind me

And all the time you remind me
Of blitzkrieg and the doodle bug
Salt upon a bubbling slug
You say I can talk to you any time
But I just want to cut some rug
Turn yourself away and shrug
And you say that I can talk any time

It's easy living in a bubble
And no complication or trouble
But it's hard to have responsibility

And judging by you, a personality

And all the time you remind me
Of blitzkrieg and the doodle bug
Salt upon a bubbling slug
You say I can talk to you any time
But I just want to cut some rug
Turn yourself away and shrug
And you say that I can talk any time

And all the time you remind me
Of blitzkrieg and the doodle bug
Salt upon a bubbling slug
You say I can talk to you any time
But I just want to cut some rug
Turn yourself away and shrug
And you say that I can talk any time
I can talk to you any time
But I just want to cut some rug
It's like blitzkrieg and the doodle bug
Salt upon a bubbling slug
You say I can talk to you any time
But I just want to cut some rug
Turn yourself away and shrug
And you say that I can talk any time
