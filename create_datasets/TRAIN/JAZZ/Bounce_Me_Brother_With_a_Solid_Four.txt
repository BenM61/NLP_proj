Say, what kind of beat is that? 
Man, it really spins my hat
Doesn't sound like boogie woogie
'Cause really got the beat
Seems to us that it's in four
Let us hear it just once more
Come on and Latch on to that rhythm
Because a Solid four's my beat 

Some folks like to hear eight beat rhythm
I don't go for that stuff no more
Anytime you really want to send me
Bounce me brother with a solid four

Come on in, the whole place is jumpin'
Every body's out on the floor
If you want to keep the rhythm pumpin'
Bounce me brother with a solid four

The boogie woogie was never like this
We've got a new beat that no one can miss
if Boogie woogie sent like I think it did
Four to the bar will flip your lid

Move the tables and roll the rug up
Shut the windows and lock the door
While I try to dig the Li'l Brown Jug up
Bounce me brother with a solid four

Clang, clang, clang, clang, clang, clang
The joint is jumpin' as it never did before
Clang, clang, clang, they're saying
Bounce me brother with a solid four

The boogie woogie was never like this
We've got a new beat that no one can miss
If boogie woogie sent you like I think it did
Four to the bar will flip your lid

Move the tables and roll the rug up
Shut the windows and lock the door
While I try to dig the Li'l Brown Jug up
Bounce me brother with a solid four
