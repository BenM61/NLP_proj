The stars that shine 
And the stars that shrink
In the face of stagnation the water runs
Before your eyes

Swallowing diamonds
A cutting throat
Your teeth when your grin
Reflecting beams on tombstones

A jamboree of surprises
Playing Russian roulette
Or the lucky dip
A clenched fist to your heart
Coal dust on your lungs

A silver tongue for the chosen one
Heavy magnum in your side
Or a bloody thorn

Skating bullets on angel dust
In the dead sea of fluid mercury
Baby piano crys
Under your heavy index and thumb
Pull some strings-let them sing

The stars that shine 
And the stars that shrink
In the face of stagnation the water runs
Before your eyes

Dazzle it's a glittering prize
Dazzle it's a glittering prize
Before your eyes
It's a glittering prize

The stars that shine 
And the stars that shrink
In the face of stagnation the water runs
Before your eyes
