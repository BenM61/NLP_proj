She lied, she lied to the FBI
When she told them she was innocent
A victimless crime, and I don't give a shit
I'd never drop dime on my baby
Though she gave it to the FBI

I lied, I lied to the FBI
When I told 'em that I did it to save her hide
Told 'em that the plan for the heist was mine
Now I'm stuck and I'm fucked, doing federal time

Locked deep inside I'm doing time for you
Just got the letter saying we are through
And I don't give a damn if I get out again
I'm doing time for you

My mistake
I will take this secret with me to the grave
And I hope and I pray
That I'll see her face again one day
