Recession, repression, regression
Recession, repression, regression
Shifts of scenery
And warning tremors of landslides

The sky comes down
The mountains move aside
Your kingdom slips out of your hands
The sky comes down
The mountains move aside
Your kingdom slips out of your hands

Your tyranny I was part of
Is now cracking on every side
And your own life is in danger
Your empire is on fire

The staggering blows
Are shaking the walls
Nowhere, no place to hide this time
The staggering blows
Are shaking the walls
Nowhere, no place to hide this time

Your tyranny I was part of
Is now cracking on every side
And your own life is in danger
Your empire is on fire is on fire

There is more sand than oil in your engine
Calm down, flare up
