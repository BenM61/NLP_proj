Love lost her way again
I stayed at home
Another sleepless night

Here by a telephone
That never seems to
Ring a ray of hope
Into a man so all alone

And i tried to let you go
Time after time
I lost my mind

Suddenly late last night
You finally called and
All my dreams came true today
You're coming home to stay

Tonight, tonight
You'll be back in my arms
Back in my life
So right, so right
We'll never have to
Say goodbye because
Tonight, tonight
The love we used to have
Is gonna return
Tonight, tonight
The love that went away
Is coming home to stay

You are my happiness
One kiss can change the past
And cast it all away

Nothing will ever
Change the way i feel
And i can hardly wait to see you
You're coming home at last

Tonight, tonight
You'll be back in my arms
Back in my life
So right, so right
We'll never have to
Say goodbye because
Tonight, tonight
The love we used to have
Is gonna return
Tonight, tonight
The love that went away
Is coming home to stay

Tonight, tonight
The love we had is returning
Make it right tonight
The love that went away
Is coming home to stay

You are my love
My everlasting love
Everlasting love
