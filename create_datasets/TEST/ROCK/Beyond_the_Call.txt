I'm searching for the anger
consider it a gift

Open up that window
come betray me with a kiss.
You have won if nothing else rope enough to hang yourself

What is that to us?
Go beyond the call of love and beyond the dreams of man.
I have seen where glory falls at the touch of mercy's hand.

The truth you would deny me
lying like a rock

How you gonna wake up to the one that you forgot?
Cover up was your intent
acting like it's accident

Isn't it enough?
Go beyond the call of love and beyond the dreams of man. ...
Someday when hearts grow stronger
I'll know where darkness wandered
But I won't wait much longer.
Go beyond the call of love and beyond the dreams of man. ...
Go beyond the call of love and beyond the dreams of man. ...
Go beyond the call of love and beyond the dreams of man. ...
