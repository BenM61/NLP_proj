Time to be done with you
Feels good when I wake in the morning, let the sun come through
I'm not thinking 'bout you
Feeling good when I look in the mirror, my skies are blue
Slept all night for the first time
In months, I'm finally where I wanna be
And all my dreams are coming true

So how does it feel to know, you messed up?
You messed up, you messed up
Bet you feel so stupid that you played with my heart
I don't care to see you, I don't care where you are
I know you didn't think it comes back around, oh
Karma, karma, karma, she's a hell of a girl, oh, oh
You messed up, you messed up, you messed up

All of your friends say you
Hang out all hours of the night 'cause you're so alone
But loving me is overdue
Shoulda done it when you had your chance, now look at you, oh

So how does it feel to know, you messed up?
You messed up, you messed up
Bet you feel so stupid that you played with my heart
I don't care to see you, I don't care where you are
I know you didn't think it comes back around, oh
Karma, karma, karma, she's a hell of a girl, oh

One day here then you're gone
I waited so long to find love on my own
Left when I needed you
That's how they always do
Well baby, so long oh oh

So how does it feel to know, you messed up?
You messed up, you messed up
Bet you feel so stupid that you played with my heart
I don't care to see you, I don't care where you are
I know you didn't think it comes back around, oh
Karma, karma, karma, she's a hell of a girl, oh

It comes back around
