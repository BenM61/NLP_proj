Everyday he plays the game per se
He's got them running around
Will they fall to the ground everytime

Life inside, he's got something to hide
Right now he's angry, denied
With a reason so don't wonder why

You're past your prime

Know what they've said is what I've done
Killed my respect for everyone
I've come this far
Not going back this time

Take a gun, they're only there for fun
It must be a movie or song
If it's right or it's wrong, it's a sign

Point the blame, violence in life's the same
And with no reason for that
We just make up the facts everytime

Make fun the crime

Know what they've said is what I've done
Killed my respect for everyone
I've come this far
Not going back this time

Know what they've said is what I've done
You can't be sure, you never know
I've come this far
Not going back this time

Hey! You've got your own opinion
Got your own opinion
You decide

Hey! You've got your own opinion
Got your own opinion
You decide
