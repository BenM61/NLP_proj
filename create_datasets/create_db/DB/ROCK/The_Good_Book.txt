Poor little hairy kids out on their own 
They run to the festival to show that 
They were one 
They've fallen in love with all human kind 
So tell them you love them
So they don't change their mind. 

Write us a book of instructions or signs 
And if it's been written
Then give us more time 
Recite a poem or sing us a song 
And tell us you love us 
So we don't feel alone. 

And it's sad that we weren't born 
Like horses and sheep 
To know where we're goin', to know 
What we need 
But you've written the music 
So we'll sing along 
But tell us you love us 
So we don't feel alone 

Give the poet a poem and the singer a song 
And then tell us you love us 
So we don't feel alone.
