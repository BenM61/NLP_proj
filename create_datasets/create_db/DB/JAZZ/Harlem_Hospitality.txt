It's the one and only Lennox Avenue,
That's the one and only place to travel to;
Music in the air,
Dancing everywhere,
That's Harlem hospitality!

When you hear a welcome to your song,
You'll keep shoutin' hallelujah all night long;
You never rest
When you get the best
Of Harlem hospitality!

It's a waste of life until you hear a song and love it,
You just, "Yeah, man!"
It's a taste of life to shim-sham-shimmy with the "Black and Tan."

You don't need to eat an apple every day,
Hi-de-ho will keep the doctor far away,
You can't get ill
When you get the thrill
Of Harlem hospitality!
