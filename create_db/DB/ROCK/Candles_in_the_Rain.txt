
little sisters of the sun lit
candles in the rain
fed the world on oats and raisins
candles in the rain
lit the fire to the soul
who never knew his friend
meher baba lives again
candles in the rain
to be there is to remember
lay it down again
lay down
lay down
lay it down again
men can live as brothers
candles in the rain
