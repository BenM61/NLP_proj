Secret best kept between the two
Witness a change of heart in you

Two together is what you are
Two together can go so far
And so far
You're the best kept secret

You dream from the start of bridging two worlds apart

They will whisper and corner you cold
Try to break the very heart and soul
Of the best kept secret

You dream from the start of bridging two worlds apart
And love so they say
Wins over the coldest heart
Coldest heart

Precious for all time with you

And love so they say
Wins over the coldest heart
Coldest heart

You dream from the start of bridging two worlds apart
And love so they say
