Oh, father time
You and me and holiday wine
Wait for the snow
I will read the list that they wrote

Said I'm by the open fire
Lovin' you is a gift tonight
Lovin' you for all my life
Lovin' you is a gift tonight

Oh everyday is Christmas when you're here with me
I'm safe in your arms, you're my angel baby
Everyday is Christmas when you're by my side
You're the gift that keeps givin', my angel for life
Everyday is Christmas
Everyday is Christmas
Everyday is Christmas with you by my side
Everyday is Christmas
Everyday is Christmas
Everyday is Christmas with you by my side

Oh, you're my love (my love)
You're the joy (the joy)
In my Holiday song
And when you smile 
I can't breathe
Can't believe that you're mine

Said I'm by the open fire
Lovin' you is a gift tonight
Lovin' you for all my life
Lovin' you is a gift tonight

Oh everyday is Christmas when you're here with me
I'm safe in your arms, you're my angel baby
Everyday is Christmas when you're by my side
You're the gift that keeps givin', my angel for life
Everyday is Christmas
Everyday is Christmas
Everyday is Christmas with you by my side
Everyday is Christmas
Everyday is Christmas
Everyday is Christmas with you by my side
