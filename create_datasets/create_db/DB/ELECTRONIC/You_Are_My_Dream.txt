You are my dream
Oh, can't you see
How much that I need you?
You are my dream
Oh, can't you see?

You are my dream
Oh, can't you see
How much that I need you?
You are my dream
Oh, can't you see?

I can never explain how much I love you
I will do anything you want me to do
And I'm going to really prove that it's true
To prove that it's true

When I look in your eyes, there's nowhere to hide
I feel your love, with no disguise
We've sealed our dreams with one single kiss
A single kiss

You are my dream
Oh, can't you see
How much that I need you?
You are my dream
Oh, can't you see
How much that I need you?
You are my dream
Oh, can't you see
How much that I need you?
You are my dream
Oh, can't you see?

Life has so much to give us right from the start
It's like you and I never have been apart
Your love to me is pure paradise
It's pure paradise

When I look in your eyes, there's nowhere to hide
I feel your love, with no disguise
We've sealed our dreams with one single kiss
A single kiss

You are my dream
Oh, can't you see
How much that I need you?
You are my dream
Oh, can't you see
How much that I need you?
You are my dream
Oh, can't you see
How much that I need you?
You are my dream
Oh, can't you see?

I need you
I need you

You are my dream (you are my dream)
Oh, can't you see
How much that I need you? 
You are my dream (you are my dream)
Oh, can't you see
How much that I need you?
You are my dream (you are my dream)
Oh, can't you see
How much that I need you?
You are my dream (you are my dream)
Oh, can't you see?

I need you
