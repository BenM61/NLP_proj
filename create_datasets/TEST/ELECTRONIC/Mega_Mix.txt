By the rivers of Babylon,where we sat down
Yeaaaaeah we wept, remembered Zion
Yeaaaaeah we wept, remembered Zion
When the wicked carried us away in captivity
Required from us a song
Now, how shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land
Sunny, yesterday my life was filled with rain
Sunny, you smiled at me and really eased the pain
The dark days are gone and the bright days are here
My sunny one shines so sincere
Sunny, one so true, I love you
FREEZE
I'M MA BAKER, BUT YER HAN"S IN THE AIR AN' GIMME ALL YER MONEY

She's crazy, like a fool What about daddy cool
Daddy, daddy cooool, daddy, daddy coooool
Daddy, daddy cooool daddy, daddy coooool
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey

There lived a certain man in Russia long ago
He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow
Most people looked at him with terror and with fear
But the Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear
He could preach the bible like a preacher, full of ecstasy and fire
But, he also was a kind of teacher in them put desire

Ra ra Rasputin
Lover of the Russian queen
They put some poison in his wine
Ra ra Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
He drank it all an' set up in fire

RA ra Rasputin
Lover of the Russian queen
They did'nt quit, they wanted his head
Ra ra Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
An' so they shot him 'til he was dead
O those Russians
