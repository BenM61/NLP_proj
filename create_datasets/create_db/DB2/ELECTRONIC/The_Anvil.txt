Lost amongst the crowd
On the torso's pumping iron
A man with a horn takes to the stage
The drum beat cracks in time

Harder and bolder the bodies move
Shoulder to shoulder skin feels smooth
Palms sticky, still so cool
The crash of the anvil at the nightclub school

Watch the moving bodies
As they react to the sound
Feasting on the visions
See the figures going round

Graceful and flowing the fashion shows
Sensual and glowing the passion grows
Pick your playmate still so cool
The crash of the anvil at the nightclub school

Take it as it comes up
Leave it when it's done
Put a number in your matchbook
And call when you want fun

Living the nightlife to the end
Giving the right life like a friend
One more rover still so cool
The crash of the anvil at the nightclub school

Ahh nightclub school

Dance with me
Ahh nightclub school

Play with me
Ahhhh Nightclub School

Stay with me
Ahh nightclub school

Ride with me
Ahh nightclub school

Have fun with me
Ahh nightclub school

Dance with me
Ahh nightclub school

The drumbeat cracks in time

Ahh nightclub school

Ahh nightclub school
