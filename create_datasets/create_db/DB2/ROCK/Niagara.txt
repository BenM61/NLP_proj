ave niagara
queen of water
fire's daughter
the ultimate author
follow the current
erode it
i rode it
and wrote it
down on looseleaf paper
oh river
oh lay color
on bodies of matter
our bodies matter
the colors scatter
down our legs
into the sand
what a combination we make
(i kind of like you a lock)
with some determination
the heat from our hearts
will freeze out the lake

you have eyes you can unlike but can't hide

with the flow comes rise...

ave niagara
keep on fallin
woo woo the spectators
pre-convert those water haters
look for something greater
let me be your float device
let me do your swear work
cause kisses aren't contracts baby
and these days neither are words

niagara
sugar even odd smiles are in this season
