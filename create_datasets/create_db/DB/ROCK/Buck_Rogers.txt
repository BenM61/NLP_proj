He's got a brand new car
Looks like a Jaguar
It's got leather seats
It's got a CD player (player, player, player...)

But I don't want to talk about it anymore
I think we're gonna make it
I think we're gonna save it yeah
So don't you try and fake it
Anymore, anymore

We'll start over again
Grow ourselves new skin
Get a house in Devon
Drink cider from a lemon (lemon, lemon, lemon...)

But I don't want to talk about it anymore
I think we're gonna make it
I think we're gonna save it yeah
So don't you try and fake it
