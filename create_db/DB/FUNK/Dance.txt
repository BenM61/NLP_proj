Modern people tend to dance
With this music I'll put you in a trance
Now dance

The music of lights spreads within
And from the rhythm came the king
And from this new day dawns the light
And now the light shines bright, dance

Children grow, some women produce
Some men they work and some steal
Everybody's got to make a livin'
The time will come my friends
And we'll all be together 'till the end

Well, feel the connection of the base line
Movin' it flows and glides like light
It shines so very bright
And that way we'll move and be out of sight

Some people have tried and tried before
Well, with this rhythm I'll give you much more
Dance, I'll put you all in a trance

Children grow, women produce
Some men work and some may fool
But through these objections we find in our lives
A glare a day the darkest night

Oh, children grow, some women produce
Some men they work and some steal
Everybody's got to make a livin'
The time has come my friends
And we'll be together 'till the end

Well, feel the music move you and dance
I'll put you all in a trance

Feel the endless flow that hit [Incomprehensible] rhythms control
They're in a life, the soul, the fire enraged in you
And that way we'll come together and multiply
Well, now dance

Children grow, some women produce
Some men they work and some steal
Everybody's got to make a livin'
The time has come my friends
And now we're together 'till the end
