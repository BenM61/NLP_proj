I can't take it
The way you treat me wrong
It's not right girl
There's something going on
All my life girl
People treat me bad
But my next love
Will be the best I ever had
Best I ever had
Best I ever had
Best I ever had
Best I ever had
Best I ever had
Best I ever had
Best I ever had
Best I ever had

I can't take it
The way you treat me wrong
It's not easy
To be here on my own
All my life girl
I just wanna be
With my next love
As much as I can be
Much as I can be
Much as I can be
Much as I can be
Much as I can be
Much as I can be
Much as I can be
Much as I can be
Much as I can be
Much as I can be
Much as I can be
Much as I can be
Much as I can be

I was wrong
All these years
To be with you is
All I ever need
All this time
I've just been
Waiting for you, waiting for you
Can't you tell
Now I'm gone
It's all I ever need
Take me back
Where I belong
To get you back is all I ever need

Best I ever had
Best I ever had
Best I ever had
Best I ever had
Best I ever had
Best I ever had
Best I ever had
Best I ever had
