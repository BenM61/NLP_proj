Sending you an SOS of love you all of thinking of would you be mine,
Be my destiny, my everything.

Everything night for I turn out the light I get down on me knees
And I pray for the day we can we come a little closer to run and
Maybe then you'll be ready, ready to hear my SOS, 
Can't you feel that I am
Sending you an SOS of love you all of thinking of would you be mine,
Be my destiny tonight.
Sending you an SOS of love you all of thinking of would you be mine,
Be my destiny, my everything.

That's what I knew that I was in love you with I thought I could it be,
Me and I would be nice, SOS press that a new happiness and baby
Now I am ready, want you hear my SOS, can't you feel that I am

Sending you an SOS of love you all of thinking of would you be mine,
Be my destiny tonight.
Sending you an SOS of love you all of thinking of would you be mine,
Be my destiny, my everything.

RAP
So hear my SOS.
So hear my SOS.

Sending you an SOS of love you all of thinking of would you be mine,
Be my destiny tonight.
Sending you an SOS of love you all of thinking of would you be mine,
Be my destiny, my everything.
