House in L.A.
You be the sunshine and it's alright now
House in L.A.
You be the sunshine and it's alright now

House in L.A.
You be the sunshine and it's alright now
Ask me to stay
But you won't say it like that
House in L.A.
You be the sunshine and it's alright now
House in L.A.
Truly you care if I'm getting on that plane
So ask me to stay
Oh God, in the hope that you can heal my pain

I feel alive in the sunlight
All my fears are only real life
Yeah, I feel alive in the sunlight now
Two whole years on the rewrite
Tell my friends I'm gonna be right there
House in L.A.

House in L.A.
You be the sunshine and it's alright now
Ask me to stay
But you won't say it like that

Cut through the haze
Lost in a camera and the whole night changed
Lost in L.A.
But you won't care about that
Eyes full of rain
You be the sunshine and it's alright now
I should've stayed
Woke up in the hope that you can heal my pain

I feel alive in the sunlight
All my fears are only real life
Yeah, I feel alive in the sunlight now
Two whole years on the rewrite
Tell my friends I'm gonna be right there

House in L.A.

House in L.A.
You be the sunshine and it's alright now
Ask me to stay
But you won't say it like that
