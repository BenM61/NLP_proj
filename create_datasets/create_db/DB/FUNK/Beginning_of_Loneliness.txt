I keep staring at the door and I keep waiting for the bell
That used to say you've come to call once more
The beginning's begun, the beginning of loneliness

Just look around and you'll see an empty chair
There in the corner of the room
Where you would wait 'til I walked down the stair
The beginning's begun, the beginning of loneliness

You've gone away
And loneliness just fills my life and never goes away
My empty arms reach for you
Oh, won't you think it over, my love'

Can't we start again' Think it over, come back
Just how many tears do I have to cry'
You've got to love me, if you don't love me I'll die

The beginning's begun, the beginning of loneliness

You've gone away
And loneliness just fills my life and never goes away
My empty arms reach for you
Oh, won't you think it over, my love'

Can't we start again' Think it over, come back
Just how many tears do I have to cry'
You've got to love me, if you don't love me I'll die
You know I've said, you've got to love me, if you don't love me I'll die

The beginning's begun, the beginning of loneliness
