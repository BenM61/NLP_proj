I feel like I'm walking'
Walking on a line
I feel like I'm walking'
Walking on a line

Do I believe in love?
No, sorry.
You want to live by my side'

Oh oh oh

But sometimes it's not easy for me,
Come on, let's go back in time.

Endless kisses, endlessly
We were so young, yes so young.
A word of wisdom : forget all about me
And get me out of your mind.

But you're not my kind,
And I ain't so special
Yes, you're not my kind of girl
You say you'll be fine,
Your life is a spiral'

Come on, let's go back in time
I feel like I'm walking on a line
Come on, let's go back in time
I feel like I'm walking'
Come on, let's go back in time
I feel like I'm walking on a line
Come on, let's go back in time
I feel like I'm walking'
Walking on a line
I feel like I'm walking'
Walking on a line

Do I believe in love?
No, sorry.
You want to live by my side'

Oh oh oh

But sometimes it's not easy for me,
Come on, let's go back in time.

Endless crisis, Shame on me
Make a promise and be strong
A word of wisdom : forget all about me
And get me out of your mind.

But you're not my kind,
And I ain't so special
Yes, you're not my kind of girl

You say you'll be fine,
Your life is a spiral'

Come on, let's go back in time
I feel like I'm walking on a line
Come on, let's go back in time
I feel like I'm walking'
Come on, let's go back in time
I feel like I'm walking on a line
Come on, let's go back in time
I feel like I'm walking'
Walking on a line
I feel like I'm walking'
You'd better give up honey
