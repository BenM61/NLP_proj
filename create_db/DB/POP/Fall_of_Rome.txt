Every morning when I wake from my bed
I find I'm yawning just a'scratchin' my head
I face the dawning and I feel like I'm dead
I been sleeping all alone
Well every daybreak as I wake from my sleep
I find I'm aching as I drag from the deep
If I were a Mustang I'd be a junk yard heap
Mirror don't lie mirror don't lie
Talk about a rolling stone.

Everybody said what's that sound
Put it in a skillet and a'slap it all around
And everybody said I can't stay home
Still thinking 'bout the Fall of Rome
Still thinking 'bout the Fall of Rome

Well all these dragons are just a'draggin' me down
I've been picking things up from the underground
Like a trackless tram I'm Bondi bound
Sitting in the depot all alone
No purity no clear white walls
Just a big stampede when the Warragul calls
Times a'menacing just gnashes and mauls
Where'm I gonna buy it where'm I gonna buy it
Gotta give a dog a bone

Everybody said what's that sound
Put it in a skillet and a'slap it all around
And everybody said I can't stay home
Still thinking 'bout the Fall of Rome
Still thinking 'bout the Fall of Rome
I've been thinking 'bout the Fall of Rome

Well I've been living a catagorical lie
Each last thrill the penultimate high
Just one more hit before I can die
Yellow teeth are snappin' all around
Well every daybreak as I wake from my bed
I find I'm aching just a'scratchin' my head
If I were a Mustang I think it's gone to my head
Mirror don't lie mirror don't lie
Talk about a rolling stone

Everybody said what's that sound
Put it in a skillet and a'slap it all around
And everybody said I can't stay home
Still thinking 'bout the Fall of Rome
Everybody said what's that sound
Put it in a skillet and a'slap it all around
And everybody said I can't stay home
Still thinking 'bout the Fall of Rome
Still thinking 'bout the Fall of Rome
Still thinking 'bout the Fall of Rome
Still thinking 'bout the Fall of Rome
I've been thinking 'bout the Fall of Rome
