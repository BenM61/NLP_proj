I woke up this morning 
My girl was not inside 
Not inside my billfold 
She's done me wrong allright 
We've been all night a rockin' 
At the house of blue night 
Ah, ah, ah... 

The band was really groovin' 
With the shades of Jerry Lee 
Somehow jiving, yeah she was taking me 
Now she's gone and left me 
Oh, baby let it be 
Ah, ah, ah... 

I didn't understand her 
You know I mean her scene 
Sleeps around for money 
Or kick's that's twice as mean 
But if I cross with her again 
She'll find that I'm not green 
Ah, ah, ah... 

This woman's a hooker 
I can't stand her 
She's doing me wrong 
This woman's a hooker...
