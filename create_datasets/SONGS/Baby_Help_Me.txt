Now that you're here
But you can't find another love
That's true and fine, oh yeah

But you come runnin' back to me
And you get down on your knees
Hey, you said, "Baby, I am here now
Help me darlin'", oh yeah

Baby had each other everyday
I keep on askin' myself, oh tell me
How could it end this way?

But you come runnin' back to me
And you get down on your knees
Hey, you said, "Baby, I am here now
Help me baby'", alright

I tried to give you everythi'
Everythin' my new love
The day you walked away
That day I had to say, it's gonna be right

Think you've got the world on a string
But baby when you walk out that door
Don't ever you blame now
Baby, oh yeah

Oh, you come runnin' back to me
And you get down on your knees
Hey, you said, "Baby, I am here now
Help me baby'", alright, alright, alright

Baby, help me baby, alright
Baby, help me baby, alright
Baby
