Oh Raquel, you really got the power over me
Oh Raquel, your silhouette's an hourglass, indeed
I saw you as a movie star
And now you're riding in my car

Oh Raquel, your fill me with inertia, yes you do
Oh Raquel, I know this when I touch you, on a balloon
Your daddy came from Bolivia
Your Irish mother gave you star, shine on

Oh Raquel, born in North Chicago, long ago
Oh Raquel, California taught you all you know
To act as though you didn't care
To paint your eyes and brush your hair

Oh Raquel, oh Raquel
Oh Raquel, oh Raquel
Oh Raquel, oh Raquel

Oh Raquel
(You really got the power)

Oh Raquel
(You really got the power)

Oh Raquel
(You really got the power)
...
