Love is a fever
And is burning me alive
It can't be tamed or satisfied
There is no mercy
For the fallen or for the weak
Love is a nasty word to speak

I don't wanna love him anymore
He's nothing like the man I loved before
But the pain gets real comfortable
When it's all ya got

Ashes and smoke they can't compete
Not even hell can take the heat
And I be sliding off of my seat
For his flame

His love is like fire on the floor
It's got me running for the door
But I'll be crawling back for more
Of his fire on the floor
It don't matter what ya say
You can't survive it, there ain't no way
So tonight I'm gonna stay
And play with his fire
On the floor
Wanna play with his fire
On the floor child, child

This kinda love
Don't need no bed or satin sheets
Nothing soft, nothing soft or sweet to drink
Love is a lesson, you were born to never learn
And your soul will beg to burn

I don't wanna love him anymore
He's nothing like the man I loved before
And there's a sign above the door
Saying no way out

Ashes and smoke they can't compete
Not even hell can take the heat
And I be sliding off of my seat
For his flame

His love is like fire on the floor
It's got me running for the door
But I keep crawling back for more
Of his fire on the floor
It don't matter what ya say
You can't survive it, there ain't no way
So tonight I'm gonna stay
And play with his fire
On the floor
I'm gonna stay and play with his fire
On the floor
I'm gonna play with his fire
On the floor
