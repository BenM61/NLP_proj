Hours pass
The weeks turn into months
And I'm still alone
Wondering when I'll see you

Still I watch the hourglass
The symbol of our love
When we were so sure
Our love would be everlasting

What changed your mind
We are the sands of time
Only sands of time
Don't ever run out on me

Time is loneliness
When you're not around
But I continue
Turnin' the hourglass upside till I see you

And whatever life brings my way
I'm always gonna know one thing
With you I'll always share all my love
Nothing can change it because we're bound by the sands of time

I won't change my mind
(No, I won't)
We are the sands of time

Only sands of time
(Ooh, baby)
Don't ever run out on me

Thought time had run out
I almost hope
(No, don't)

It's hard to keep the faith
Oh, but if you believe
You can make almost anything you ever want come true
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

And I'll wait for you, baby
(You know I want you, baby)
And if we believe, it will only come true
(Mmm, mmm)

I won't change my mind
(It's so lonely when you're not around)
We are the sands of time
(Turn the hourglass upside down)

Only sands of time
(We won't ever, never, never)
Don't ever run out on me
(Hoo, hoo, hoo)

I won't change my mind
(Oh, oh, oh)
We are the sands of time
(Bound by the sand of time)

Only sands of time
(The sands of time)
Don't ever run out on me

Believe we always come together in the sands of time
