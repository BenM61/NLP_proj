Well I want you to notice
To notice when I'm not around
To notice your eyes see straight through me
And speak to me without a sound

I wanna hold you
Protect you from all of the things I've already endured
And I wanna show you
Show you all the things that this life has in
Store for you
And I'll always love you
The way that a father should love his daughter

When I woke up this morning
I cried as I walked to the door
I cried about how long I'll be away for
I cried about leaving you all alone

I wanna hold you
Protect you from all of the things I've already endured
And I wanna show you
Show you all the things that this life has in
Store for you
And I'll always love you
The way that a father should love his daughter

Sweet Zoe Jane
Sweet Zoe Jane

So I wanted to say this
'Cause I wouldn't know where to begin
To explain to you what I have been through
To explain where your daddy has been

I wanna hold you
Protect you from all of the things I've already endured
And I wanna show you
Show you all the things that this life has in
Store for you
And I'll always love you
The way that a father should love his daughter

Sweet Zoe Jane
Sweet Zoe Jane
