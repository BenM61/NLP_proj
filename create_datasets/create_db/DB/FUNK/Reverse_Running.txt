I'm in reverse running
Doesn't mean anything
Hurling headlong
Why would you even ask
I forgot who I am
Snakes uncoiling

Pressed up to the glass
All things you shouldn't ask
But you see through me

It doesn't mean anything
A meaningless plaything
Reverse running

Running contrary-ways
Pulling off the anyways
I'm messing up
Messing up the balance
Breaking my trajectory
All the toys in the factory

While you all lie down
While you all lie down
I'm skipping back through the tapes.
Skipping through the ad breaks.
God in heaven

If it makes you feel energized
All hands are sanitized
And with such joy
Running contrary-ways
Pulling off the anyways
I jump back around

I'm reversing
I'm reverse running
Falling in the horses feet
All the feelings that you shouldn't see
Animal are burned
Animal are burned
Moving in slow motion
This shit is gonna mess me up
