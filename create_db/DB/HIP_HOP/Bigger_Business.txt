Jadakiss, Mr. Biggs, it's big business, nigga this is our show
Twenty two master bedrooms in the crib
The garage like the car show not only am I real, I think
But I still jab a nigga with the left and won't spill my drink
The Courvoisier got me clashes
Honey all over me like ashes throwin' that green molases
Your dealin' with D-Block, and Full Surface
And ain't no payment plans it's full purse-full

A'yo I'm dealin' with this mami from Quebec
When she fly in I pull the boat out and blow scomie on the deck
Shootin' at the stars, Tommy and the Tek, come on
Soon as the Dutch finish you can find me on the neck
No foreplay, bustin' the pound raise me
Middle of the ocean, bustin' her down crazy
You know me, I ain't on no star shit
I just came to hurt the market then squirt the Larkin
Put your hands up, matter fact put your mans up
Put your medina's and your lambs up, your grams up
Talkin' 'bout buckin' each other, probly fuckin' each other
D-Block dawg, we stuck with each other

A yo, Full Surface, Swizz Beatz is in front of him
Got a lot of problems but money ain't one of them
V12's and up, that's our ammo
Tell me what you know about a jet ski Limo
Waterproof knock in it, ain't no stoppin' it
Automatic respect whenever D-Block's in it
Or we can take it to the avenue too
And bring the Porsche GT out, lavender blue
Shit change, Kiss came and it's all extortion
Everybody eat except for smaller portions
For real though, behave yourself on some grown shit
It ain't enough room dawg, I'm on my own hit
