You beat us down but we came back, revenge is sweet and we're on the attack.
Who are you, what do you do ?
You promised us the world then took it away.
Slogging 'round the country for a tenner a day, we got got wise, to your idle lies.

The missing rung, we all knew.
We survived Catch 23.
Now we're prepared and that's the key.
So we'll survive Catch 23.

Organization, a word you've never heard.
The cheques you wrote which never cleared.
Your big ideas, our biggest fears.
Your representatives of your name.
And you'll be forgotten as quickly as you came.
Now your gone, we'll carry on.
