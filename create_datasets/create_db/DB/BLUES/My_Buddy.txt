Nights are long since you went away
I think about you all through the day
My buddy, my buddy, no buddy quite so true
Miss your voice, the touch of your hand
Just long to know that you understand
My buddy, my buddy, your buddy misses you

Miss your voice, the touch of your hand
Just long to know that you understand
My buddy, my buddy, your buddy misses you
