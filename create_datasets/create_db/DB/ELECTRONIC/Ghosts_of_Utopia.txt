You are haunted by the turmoil of your lives
Walking circles, crossing lines
And it is tearing up your souls, of this fury
Jumping hurdles, just to abide

You are drowning in the sorrow of a billion opinions
Nobody can hear you
Nobody can hear you
This is psychosis
This is psychosis
This is the jigsaw blown apart

You are the ghost of Utopia
You're the conquered stars, the divided hearts
You are the ghost of Utopia
You're the miracle of America

Every time you learn you don't regret
All your hurting, all your debts
Cause the wife and kids won't help you to forget
The emergency of your secrets and your trash

You are drowning in the sorrow of a billion opinions
Nobody can hear you
Nobody can hear you
This is psychosis
This is psychosis
This is the jigsaw blown apart

You are the ghosts of Utopia
You're the conquered scars, the divided hearts
You are the ghost of Utopia
You're the miracle of America

You are drowning in the sorrow of a billion opinions
Nobody can hear you
Nobody can hear you
This is psychosis
