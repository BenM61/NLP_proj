Sanity, where have you gone?
You leave at night, return at dawn
I fall from grace, here in the dark
Turn the dive into a work of art

I kissed somebody, I don't know her name
My baby saw me, but I felt no shame
I start to fight with anyone who's in
Hurt everybody, but I feel no pain

I just wanna feel something
I just wanna feel something

Hear me now, laugh with the crowd
But inside the silence screaming loud
Touch me now, my body is warm
But inside, I'm frozen to the bone

I held some bodies tried to crush the cold
But I'm not sorry for the hearts I stole
I wish I could give you tears from my eyes
But it seems that I forgotten how to cry

I just wanna feel something
I just wanna feel something

I'm drinking until I'm drunk
I'm sinking until I'm sunk
But nothing I do, nothing I do seems to fill me
I'm bleeding but I'm still numb
I'm wasted but I still run (still run)
Run right into, run right into what might kill me

Just to feel something
I just wanna feel something
Just to feel something
(I just wanna feel something)

Sanity, where have you gone?
You leave at night, return at dawn
