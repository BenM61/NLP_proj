Cruisin' downtown
Shakin' her love
T and A talkin' to me
Felt my heart drop
Wheeled a dead stop
Girl has got me on my knees
Baby baby babe don't make me wonder
Won't you let me in
She said - see you later
Shot down
I'll be back again

Good love is all you need
But you don't want to know
Cold blood is all you bleed
When it cools off - you tease it
When it gets hot - you freeze it
Cold blood is all you bleed

Dresses so tight
Moving to the beat
Set my feet on fire
Dream come true I want to give it to you
Let the flame get higher
Baby baby you're driving me crazy
Like a cat in a cage
You make me sh-sh-sh-shiver - earthquake
Down town to the blaze

Good love is all you need
Give me what I know
Cold blood is all you bleed
When it cools off - you tease it
When it gets hot - you freeze it
Cold blood is all you bleed

You make me so hot
I feel my temperature rise
Don't shoot me down - No

When it cools off - you tease it
When it gets hot - you freeze it
Cold blood is all you bleed

Cold blood is all you bleed
Cold blood is all you bleed
Cold blood is all you bleed
