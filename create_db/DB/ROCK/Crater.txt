Crater!

I was bombed by a sanity defect
And I can't rebound from the impact
All words and actions have a collision effect
My blood strives towards a frenzied cataract

'Cause you ground me with your social mano
Even in my sleep
Until I became a raging volcano
That couldn't be slaked, not even by the neap

I'm like a crater with giant ejecta
Behind a wall my senses speak
The emotions melt into a mental breccia
Their velocity shows in the central park

In my arteries, furious projectiles
Of blood, coloured by extremity
Oxygenates the muscles as they rile
And breed rage out of cavity

Through the atmosphere of my bodily shell
Your words cut like an asteroid
And carry me into an earthly hell
To the bottom of the crater's void

I'm like a crater with giant ejecta
Behind a wall my senses speak
The emotions melt into a mental breccia
Their velocity shows in the central park
