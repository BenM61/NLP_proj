Call from you long distance.
Rang the midnight phone.
Can't forget the words you've said,
"I feel so far away from home.
I only want to hold you, I know you want the same.
I only wish that we could make a million miles fade away".

Something in your sadness wants to make me cry.
There's no easy way to be so far away.
Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why.
Remember those who love you and all the love you've known.
If you can remember you will always be at home.

You're never far away from home.
Can you remember ?  You're never far away from home.
'Cause all the ones who love you, are thinking of you there alone, far from home.
Keeping you besides us, never far away from home.

All the best intentions are sometimes put to shame.
There will always be regrets when you are far away, so far away.
If you can remember every face and name,
somehow all the miles will fade and you'll be home again.

You're never far away from home, no.
Can you remember ? You're never far away from home.
'Cause all the one's who love you are thinking of you there all alone, far from home.
Keeping you besides us, never far away from home.

(Never, you're never too far from home) You're never far away from home.
(Never, you're never too far from home) Can you remember ? You're never far away from home.
'Cause all the ones who love you, are thinking of you there alone, far from home.
Keeping you besides us, never, never, never, never far away from home.

(Never, you're never too far from home) Somehow all the miles will fade away
and you'll be home someday.
(Never, you're never too far from home) You're never, never, never too far from home.
You're never, never too far.
