We live for the music no matter what the world comes to 
We fight back in stereo that push the volume to 

We live for the music
We live for the music
We live for the music
We live for the music
We live for the music
We live for the music
We live for the music
We live for the music
We live for the music
We live for the music
We live for the music
We live for the music
We live for the music
We live for the music
We live for the music
We live for the music

Now if you ever met someone who told you we can do the dance 
Turning up the music making you feel you don't have a chance 
Tell that person that now is the time turn around we think no more 
Cause we living for the music our weapon at the stereo so push that volume up 

We live for the music no matter what the world comes to 
We fight back in stereo that push the volume to 

We live for the music no matter what they want to do 
We fight back in stereo and push the volume to 

We live for the music
We live for the music
We live for the music
We live for the music
We live for the music
We live for the music
We live for the music
We live for the music
We live for the music
We live for the music
We live for the music
We live for the music
We live for the music
We live for the music
We live for the music
We live for the music
