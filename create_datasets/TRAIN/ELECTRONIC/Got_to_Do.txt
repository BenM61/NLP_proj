Late at night
The lights rush by
I'm on the road again
Another town
Another crowd to face
But this feeling I'd never replace

I got to do what I do
But nothing lasts forever
Soon I'll be back by your side
I got to do what I do
We'll be together
Until the end of time

Fear and doubts
Running through my mind
What have I done with my life
Then I think of you
And I know for sure
I can take it all again
I got to do ...

Baby hold on a little while
I promise I'm gonna stay this time
I need to know that you wait for me
Please try to understand why
