You say you want to find someone that's easy to talk to
Someone who will look you in the eyes and understand
Say you've been looking so long, you don't know if he's out there
Look no further, ?cause I am the man

And you don't even know how good a love
I'm gonna give you
You don't even know you're going to be
Changing all your plans

you've been worrying, waiting, wondering
Where he'd come from
Look no further, ?cause I am the man

I want you to forget about the times
That love has failed you
Put it all behind you now, just smile
And take my hand

And every precious dream of everlasting
Love and friendship
I?ll make it real baby ?cause I'm the man

And you don't even know how good a love
I'm gonna give you
You don't even know you're going to be
Changing all your plans

you've been worrying, waiting, wondering
Where he'd come from
Look no further, ?cause I am the man

And I know it?s not easy, easy to believe me
But you're gonna know before I'm through
That every word is true, I'm the loving proof

And you don't even know how good a love
I'm gonna give you
You don't even know you're going to be
Changing all your plans

you've been worrying, waiting, wondering
Where he'd come from
Look no further, ?cause I am the man
