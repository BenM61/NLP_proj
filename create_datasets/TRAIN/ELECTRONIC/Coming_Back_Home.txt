Took some time to come around
Realize how I let you down
Been too late for sorry now
My pride got in the way
Yes it did

I thought I had it all figured out
I needed time away to work it out
And now that I've learned what it's all about
And all I need is you in my life

So I'm coming back home
Home, where love is waiting for me
Been gone much too long
This is where I want to be
So I'm coming home
Coming home
'Cause home is where I belong

Somehow I lost my way
Mistakes I made I have to pay
It hurts to know still today
That I wasted so much time

And after all is said and done
There's more to life than having fun
Ain't no doubt, you're the one
And all I need is you in my life

So I'm coming back home
Home, where love is waiting for me
Been gone much too long
This is where I want to be
So I'm coming home
Coming home
'Cause home is where I belong

Just to be in your arms is like heaven to me
Your love, your love is all that I need
So I'm coming back home
And I hope you forgive all my wrong
So I'm coming home, coming home
'Cause home is where I belong

So I'm coming back home
Home, where love is waiting for me
Been gone much too long
This is where I want to be
So I'm coming home
Coming home
'Cause home is where I belong
