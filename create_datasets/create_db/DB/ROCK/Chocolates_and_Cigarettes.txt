Living on a diet of Chocolates & Cigarettes
I wanna call you again
I'll drink tea sometimes when its cold
This is getting old
I call you again

Still too young to fail, too scared to sail away
But one of these days I'll grow old
And I'll grow brave and I'll go
One of these days

Blowing out the candles from my cake
I choke on the smoke as I look around the room
Everybody's wishing for no more mistakes
And all that I can think about is you

Still too young to fail, to scared to sail away
But one of these days I'll grow old
And I'll grow brave and I'll go
One of these days
La da la da la da

Still too young to fail, to scared to sail away
But one of these days I'll grow old
And I'll grow brave and I'll go
One of these days
La da la da la da
