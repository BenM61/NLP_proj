What are you afraid of
I know that you are
Keep it in your sights now
And don't let it go far
What are you afraid of
Making it better
Keep it by your side now
Whatever the weather
Keep it together
Keep it together
What did you do
Wonder where your heart came from
What have you done
My only friend keep on
Wander or leave
Turn into winter lights
Keeping your strength
When it gets dark at night
What are you made of
Water and glass
Keep it in your sights now
It's keeping you up
Keep it together
Keep it together

What did you do, wonder where
Your heart came from
What have you done
My only friend keep on
Wander or leave,
Turn into winter lights
Keeping your strength
When it gets dark at night

Keep on
Keep the straight line
I'm running, running
The straight line

What did you do, wonder where
Your heart came from
What have you done
My only friend keep on
Wander or leave,
Turn into winter lights
Keeping your strength
When it gets dark at night

What you're feeling
It's what I'm feeling too
What you're made of
It's what I'm made of too
What are you afraid of
I know that you are
What are you afraid of
I know that you are
