Have my words run dry?
Seems the more I try
Time is in my mind
And spreading down for rumours
Try to get you down
Winding myself round and round
Hoping for a bliss down moment

Hanging myself out
Been hanging myself out to you
I've been hanging myself out to dry
Caught on a line
Try to let go
You know we all fall down a little sometimes
Out of control
Still waiting for flow
Waiting for flow

Welcoming the dawn
Left the telly on
Haven't slept at all
Time says I'm hopeless
Finally you come
Just as I swear I'm done
I reach another lightbulb moment

Pulling myself out
Been pulling myself out to you
I've been pulling myself over you
Caught on a line
Try to let go
You know we all fall down a little sometimes
Out of control
Still waiting for flow
Waiting for flow

You leave me waiting
So tired of waiting for flow
You leave me waiting
So tired of waiting for flow

I've been hanging myself out
Been hanging myself out to you
I've been hanging myself out to dry
Caught on a line
Try to let go
You know we all fall down a little sometimes
Out of control
You know we all fall down sometimes
Try to let go
Still waiting for flow
Waiting for flow

You leave me waiting
So tired of waiting for flow
You leave me waiting
So tired of waiting for flow
