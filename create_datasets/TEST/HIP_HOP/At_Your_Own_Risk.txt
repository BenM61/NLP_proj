It's at your own...
It's at your own... It's at your own
It's at your own... It's at your own
It's at your own risk, sucker!

Yo! Whassup? Yo... What's happenin', what's happenin'?
E-Swift, you cuttin' the records nice boy
DJ Pooh whassup man? We all chillin'
Yo, yo, J-Ro's in the house, we all cold coolin' out y'knahmsayin'?
And I'ma bust it off like this for Compton

Well, look who sprung up, comin' the f*ck up
I came in the place to let you know what's up
With a bunch of trunk jewelery
Two or three fat gold chains, ring plates with my name on 'em
Yeah I rhyme fly, real fly Hobbes
I wear Nike's 'cause I run from the cops
Pops taught me lots he said
