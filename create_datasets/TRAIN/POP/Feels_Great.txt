Yeah

Growing up in the golden age
Throwing rocks at your window pane
Kiss me once and I'll float away
But that ain't me anymore
Well I don't mind if I sell my soul
To get a song on the radio
Credit cards and my student loans
That's so millennial

Do you remember how it feels to be young?
Do you remember?
We could be anyone (be anyone)
Now I miss the view from the floor of your room
September came way too soon
Do you remember how it feels to be young?
It feels great, mothafucka, yeah
It feels great, mothafucka, yeah
It feels great, mothafucka, yeah

Remember cutting class we would smoke and chill
It was only gym and lunch
We thought it was real
I was even failing math, I ain't even care
Yeah just to be around you made it worth it
I dropped out, but you still said I'm perfect
I remember at the prom you was perfect
I remember you were walking on graduation day
I never got the chance to say
That I remember all the time that we spent
And I remember you were really my friend
And I remember when they all looked and laughed
Now it's crazy how they all on yo ass

It feels great, mothafucka, yeah, yeah baby
It feels great, mothafucka, yeah, yeah baby
It feels great, mothafucka, yeah, yeah baby
Yeah, it feels great, mothafucka, yeah

Yeah, it feels great, mothafucka, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, eh eh

Do you remember how it feels to be young?
Do you remember?
We could be anyone (be anyone)
Now I miss the view from the floor of your room
September came way too soon
Do you remember how it feels to be young?
It feels great, mothafucka, yeah (yeah)
It feels great, mothafucka, yeah (yeah)
It feels great, mothafucka, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, it feels great, mothafucka, yeah
