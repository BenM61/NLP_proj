I've been all around the world
And got to know a million girls
I can see your face is from another place
Baby you can take me there tonight

Baby with you desert eyes
From another time
When love is still advance, if I get the chance
Baby you can take me for a ride

I can't wait to get you on the floor
Baby where in the world you learn to dance like that
What a beautiful sight to see
If you want to dance, dance with me
Show me how to move it baby

Tell where in the world you learn to dance like that
By the Mediterranean sea
If you want to dance, dance with me
Show me how to shake it baby

Let the love affair begin
I want to touch your olive skin
I want to feel the sea rushing over me
As I love you again and again

It's magic when your body moves
I love the way your music plays
Do you move your lips the way you move your hips?

I can't wait to get you on the floor
Baby where in the world you learn to dance like that
What a beautiful sight to see
If you want to dance, dance with me
Show me how to move it baby

Tell where in the world you learn to dance like that
By the Mediterranean sea
If you want to dance, dance with me
Show me how to shake it baby

Baby where you learn to dance like that
What a beautiful sight to see
If you want to dance, dance with me
Show me how to move it baby

Tell where in the world you learn to dance like that
By the Mediterranean sea
If you want to dance, dance with me
Show me how to shake it baby

Baby where you learn to dance like that
What a beautiful sight to see
Don't you wanna dance?
If you want to dance, dance with me
Show me how to move it baby

Tell where in the world you learn to dance like that
By the Mediterranean sea (When the music plays, your body is amazing)
