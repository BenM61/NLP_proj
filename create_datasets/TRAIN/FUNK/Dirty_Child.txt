Looking for home, looking for a corner
Where I can write alone, words for my mother
And how I came through, kicking and screaming
Smack that little ass doctor, make sure baby feels it

Daddy wonders if she'll ever wake from her dream of
Big bright stars, and she wants to be the biggest one
Look at our baby there, up on the stage
Come back baby come, back home to me

If I could I'd tell you when I'm coming back again
I wish I could tell you, I was coming back again
If I could I'd tell you when I'm coming back again
I wish I could tell you I was coming
If I can ever come back again

Dirty child, cover your black eyes
We'll feed you water and fix you up inside
We'll hide you here and get you out of that dirty business
Those damn fools they nearly took our baby from us

Daddy wonders if she'll ever wake from her dreams of
Big bright stars, and she wants to be the biggest one
Look at our baby there, up on the stage
Come back baby come, back home to me

If I could tell you I was coming back again
I wish I could tell you I'm coming back again
If I could I'd tell you when I'm coming back again
I wish I could tell you I'm coming
If I can ever come back again

You can't make it go, you can't make it stop
And you can't put out a fire, if it's burning hot!

Daddy tell me, if I'll ever wake from this dream of
Big bright stars and I wanna to be the biggest
Take a look at your baby, ain't she pretty on the stage
Come back baby, come back home to me

I wish I could come back again
Mamma, poppa, you'll never know how bad
If I could tell you I'm coming back again
I would tell you I'm coming back
If I am ever coming back again
