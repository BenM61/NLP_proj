Give me your eyes that I might see
Blind man kissing my hands
The sun is humming my head turns to dust
As he plays on his knees
As he plays on his knees

The sand and the sea grows
I close my eyes
Move slowly through drowning waves
Going away on a strange day

And I laugh as I drift in the wind
Blind dancing on a beach of stone
Cherish the faces as they wait for the end
A sudden hush across the water
And we're here again

The sand and the sea grows
I close my eyes
Move slowly through drowning waves
Going away on a strange day

(Incomprehensible)
And the sky and the impossible explode

Held for one moment I remember a song
An impression of sound
Then everything is gone forever

Strange day
Strange day
