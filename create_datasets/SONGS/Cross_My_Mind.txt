I was just thinking about you
Wondering if you wear the same cologne
Smelled good
On you
Had the next boyfriend of mine try the same kind 
But it stunk on him though.
You know what they say everything ain't for everybody
But I tried anyway
You sure did smell good

You just running cross my mind
You just running cross my mind
You just running cross my mind

You had that masculine thing down
Shoulders, back straight never sloping never round
It would turn me on just to see you walk into a room
Across the room, out of the room
You really impressed me
Eh yeah

You just running cross my mind
You just running gross my mind
You just running gross my mind

I know if I pick up this phone, write this letter send this two way
I know I'm gonna say some things, I know you gonna say some things
That we both don't mean to say
Like, how amazing, how amazing
When you would spread my limbs cross continents 
And bababed way over mountains
Kiss this and this and this and this and this 
And this and this and this and this and that
Show each other where the climax is at

You just running cross my mind
You just running cross my mind
You just running cross my mind

I was just thinking about you
Wondering what you doing I mean what you've been up to
I know its wrong feeling this strong let me take a second minute 
I will think this thing through

I was just thinking about you
Wondering what you doing I mean what you've been up to
I know its wrong feeling this strong let me take a second minute 
I will think this thing through

Remember all the moments for two, how we used to
Oh yeah
But the reality honestly
You where never good for me and I was never good for you
I just remember what we used to do
