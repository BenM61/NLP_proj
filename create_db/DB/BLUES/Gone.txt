At the end of the day when all had been done 
And all had been said 
In the kitchen laughing with you 
Before I went to bed 
My face in the light illuminated 
Untroubled and safe 
As your face is shining upon me 
A love that would never cease 
Out where the cold wind blows 
It rocks my childhood sleep 
And up in the starry skies 
And further out to sea 
Late in time when it will come 
I see it in my dreams 
At night with the cold wind blowing 
At night with the cold wind blowing outside 
Gone the dream, it's all faded now 
Gone the dream, it's all faded now 
Take me home 
Hours pass ticking slowly 
Lying wide awake 
All across the land the lights are out 
Under an open sky 
I feel for you and everybody 
Dreaming in your beds 
I'm feeling lost, there is nothing 
Nothing more than this 
Going out where the cold wind blows 
It rocks my childhood sleep 
And up in the starry skies 
And further out to sea 
Late in time when it will come 
I see it in my dreams 
At night with the cold wind blowing 
At night with the cold wind blowing
