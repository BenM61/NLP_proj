My daddy was a bankrobber
He never hurt nobody
He just loved to live that way
And he loved to steal your money

Some is rich and some is poor
And that's the way the world is
But I don't believe in lying back
Sayin' how bad your luck is

The old man spoke up in a bar
Said, ?I've never been in prison
A lifetime serving one machine
Is ten times worse than prison?

?Imagine if all the boys in jail
Could get out now together
What do you think they'd wanna say to us
While we were being clever??
