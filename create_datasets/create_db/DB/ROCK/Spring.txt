Caught in time so far away from where our hearts really wanted to be 
Reaching out to find a way to get back to where we'd been 
And if summer left you dry with nothing left to try 
This Time... Caught at a distance from myself and there was no one there to know 

What could I do? 
I have learned sometimes a need can run too deep and we throw away the things 
We most wanted to keep and inside we lie over and over again 
This Time... 

If you don't know you'd better learn to believe me 
When I say I'm going to build a wall around this town Around these hearts and hands.
