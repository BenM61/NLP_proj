Damn that was so good I wanna buy him a short set

I'mma be like a Jolly Rancher that you get from the corner store
I'mma be like a waffle cone that's dripping down to the floor
The way you do if for me I can't lie
About to be up in the mall all night
Whatever I get you putting it on
Don't give me no lip let mama do it all

Let me be, I wants to be, gots to be
Your sugar, give mama some sugar, mama (sugar mama mama mama I'm your!)
Sugar mama, sugar mama (sugar mama)
Let me be, I wants to be, gots to be
New whip, new heavy on the wrist 'cause I'm a 
Sugar mama mama mama, I'm your!
Sugar mama, sugar mama

Hey, hey 
Sit on mama lap (hey, hey) 
Come sit on mama lap (hey) 
Come sit on mama lap (hey, hey) 
Come sit on mama lap (hey) 

It's so good to the point that I'd
Do anything to keep you home
Baby what you want me to buy
My accountant's waiting on the phone (on the phone)
Just the thought of making love to you
Dropping everything that's what I'll do
Whatever I get you putting it on
Now take it off while I watch you perform

Let me be, I wants to be, gots to be
Your sugar, give mama some sugar mama (sugar mama mama mama I'm your!)
Sugar mama, sugar mama (sugar mama)
Let me be, I wants to be, gots to be
New whip, new heavy on the wrist 'cause I'm a 
Sugar mama mama mama, I'm your!
Sugar mama, sugar mama 'cause I'm a
Sugar mama mama mama, I'm your!
Sugar mama, sugar mama 

Hey, hey 
Sit on mama lap (hey, hey) 
Come sit on mama lap (hey) 
Come sit on mama lap (hey, hey) 
Come sit on mama lap (hey)

And I've always been the type to take care of mine
I know just what I'm doing
Don't you worry it's cool and everything is steady
Claimed you on my taxes already, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I promise I won't let no bills get behind
'Cause every touch, every kiss and hug
You best believe it'll be on time
Sugar mama mama mama yeah yeah yeah (let me be, I wants to be, gots to be)

Your sugar give mama some sugar mama (I give you all my money baby)
(Sugar mama mama mama I'm your!) (sugar mama) (honey I'll call something crazy)
Sugar mama (sugar mama) (take my credit card, the key to my house)
Let me be, I wants to be, gots to be (take my car)
New whip, new heavy on the wrist 'cause I'm a 
Sugar mama mama mama, I'm your!
Sugar mama (sugar mama hey, hey)

Sit on mama lap (hey, hey) (yes!)
