Let's not forget this place 
Let's not neglect our race 
Let unity become 
Life on earth be one 
So let me take your hand 
We are but grains of sand 
Born through the winds of time 
Given a special sign 

So let's take a stand 
And look around us now  people 
Let's take a stand 
And look around us now  people 

[Chorus:]
Hey yeah oh  hey yeah oh hey yeah oh  by yeah 
To a different beat 
Hey yeah oh  hey yeah oh hey yeah oh  by yeah 

Humanity's lost face 
Let's understand its grace 
Each day one at a time 
Each life, including mine 

Let's take a stand 
And look around us now, people 
So let's take a stand 
And look around us now, 
People oh people, oh people 

[Chorus]

I've seen the rain fall in Africa 
I've touched the snow of Alaska 
I've felt the mist of Niagara 
Now I believe in you 

[Chorus]

To a different beat 

How far we've come 
And how far to go 
Rain does not fall 
On one roof alone 
To a different beat
