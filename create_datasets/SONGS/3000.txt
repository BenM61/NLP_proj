Three thousand!!! 
Three thousand!! 
I crank up lyrical flows  spit spats  what's that 
The pattern records  don't touch the DATs  yo 
Check out the pro skills  medic fulfills 
Contact react to style I'm back you lack 
Channels and handles  Automator's on the panels 
Turnin' knobs you slobs suckers like Baskin Robs 
Carvel don't tell your whole crew is ice cream fudge 
Rappers that budge  makin moves step in grooves 
And ride the pace like at thirty-three dark shades 
Now you seein me 
Rap moves on to the year three thousand 

Three thousand! 
Three thousand! 
Three thousand! 

Let me shuffle red red red see the black heart it ain't hard 
Pick and choose you lose oops you lost 
Check out the boss on Broadway down to walkways 
Suckers with mics that end up with tooth decay 
I, the Doctor, stop ya, in your world rock ya 
Heads bop, forever tunes and they won't stop like hip-hop 
Keeps growing, sick of sick of showing 
Scratches in mattress business money reattaches worldwide 
Deep inside stops the diamond rocks 
In a million world, billion world, quadrillion world 
Rap moves on to the year three thousand 

Three thousand! 
Three thousand! 
Three thousand! 
Three thousand! 

As space I've shown participator acts walk up clog up and mess up 
Water down the sound, that comes from the ghetto 
In the middle the core you tour explore experience 
What is real you feel, changing ways 
Commercial rap's in the grave, stuff on disc that's very wack 
That you saved, you think it's good won't go platinum 
Or even turn wood, sell the cassette 
Your homey's tape deck gets wet 
You my pet, my poodle chicken noodle's on the rise 
Open your eyes and see my life 
Rap moves on to the year three thousand! 

Three thousand!! 
Three thousand!! 
Three thousand!! 
Three thousand!!!
