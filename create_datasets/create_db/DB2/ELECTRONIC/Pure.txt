some people look for love
settle when they've looked enough
others will take their time
takes too long they'll soon find
some people need their fear
they think it makes life clear
no one's on earth alone
yet everyone's on their own

someday one day maybe
somehow, not now and you will find
what you lose
when you have peace of mind
most start out with great ambition
years gone by
lose your time lose your mind
drink that wine, drink that wine

look at me i'm pure
everything that i am i adore
it's the reason that life is for
it's my heart that i need to be sure
heep it pure
be pure, anything that you dare and more
every nap of my hair i'm pure
what you love at the root, at the core
keep it pure

some people look for love
settle when they've looked enough
most people think they have time
to begin life
they're so wrong
they're so wrong
they're so wrong
what i dream of, if i dream hard enough
will become mine
if i don't run out of all my time
most people have intuition
to love life
love your life
feel alive, feel alive
look at me i'm
free...la la la la la
