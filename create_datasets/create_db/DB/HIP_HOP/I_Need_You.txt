I need you girl
I couldn't live a day without you
Well I tried to write a special song
A love song just for you
To explain the way you make you feel inside
Thought the meaning may be simple
And the words may not be new
I couldn't make it clearer if I tried
I need you
And I couldn't live a day without you
I need you
More than anyone I ever know
I need you
And I want to build my world around you
I need you
I need you
Well I sang the words and realized
It had all been said before
So I tried a different rhyme that meant the same
But it didn't have the feeling
And the first one said much more
So I guess I'll have to say it once again
I need you
And I couldn't live a day without you
I need you
More than anyone could ever know
(More than anyone could ever know)
Couldn't live a day without you girl
I need you and I want to build my world around you
Baby I need you
Oh I need you
(Baby)
Couldn't live a day without you
More than anyone could ever know
(More than anyone could ever know)
Couldn't live a day without you girl
I need you and I want to build my world around you
I need you
I need you
(I need you)
(I want you)
And I couldn't live a day without you
(Couldn't live a day without you)
I need you
(Yeah yeah)
More than anyone could ever know
(More than anyone could ever know)
I need you
(I need you)
(I want you)
And I couldn't live a day without you
(Couldn't live a day without you)
I need you
(Yeah yeah)
I need you
Well I tried a special song
A love song just for you
I need you
