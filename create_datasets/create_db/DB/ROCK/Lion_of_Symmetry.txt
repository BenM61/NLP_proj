The stars ignite as the sun sets
And disappears in a river of dancing molten gold
In the moon rise the lion steps out tonight

No law, no sin, no rip it up and start again
No tears, no pain, no fear, no more chains

The office walls are closing in
As the telex machines perversely sing ignored
You're hypnotized and the lion roars within

No law, no sin, no rip it up and start again
No tears, no pain, no fear, no more chains
Why are we here? Not just to live and breathe
I cannot sleep, I need the beast
I need some action, I need destruction
I'll return to the wild, I'll return to the child I said
No sense of emotion adrift in the ocean
Here we are knee-deep in stars, knee-deep in stars

City nights caressed in a shroud
All is quiet and the silence is tentatively loud
You kiss the streets as you crawl on your hands and feet

No law, no sin, no rip it up and start again
No tears, no pain, no fear, no more chains

Why are we here? Not just to live and breathe
I cannot sleep, I need the beast
I need some action, I need destruction
I'll return to the wild, I'll return to the child I said
No sense of emotion adrift in the ocean
Here we are knee-deep in stars, knee-deep in stars

Moving in the darkness
Phosphorus eyes, jungle pride
A glisten of madness, a wave of sadness
The lion never sleeps, he's never at peace
He stalks so boldly, so nervous, so coldly
Vicious serenity, perverse intensity
Head bowed stretched proudly, embrace the earth
Same blood, same soul, same breath, same goal

The office walls are closing in, feel the sensation
Telex machines perversely sing raw communication
And you're hypnotized, a transformation
The lion steps out tonight

And you kiss the damp streets with ease
As you crawl on your hands and feet
Naked is the beast and the beast is forever free
You are the lion, you are the lion of symmetry
Golden warrior savage, savage creature
You are the lion, you are the lion of symmetry

No law, no sin, no rip it up and start again
No tears, no pain, no fear, no more chains
