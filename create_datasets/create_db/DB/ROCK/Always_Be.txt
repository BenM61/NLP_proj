ould've been a night like any other
One of us has to drive
One of us gets to think
I'll force a laugh to break the silence
It's gonna get harder still
Before it gets easy
You can't keep safe what whats to break

I'm alone in this
I'm as I've always been
Right behind what's happening
She's lost in this
She's like she'll always be
A little far for me to reach

I was just a boy like every other
I thought I was something fierce
I thought I was ten times smarter
Love would be something that I just know
(Something I just know)
How you gonna know the feeling till you've lost it
I've been losing plenty since

I'm alone in this
I'm as I've always been
Right behind what's happening
She's lost in this
She's like she'll always be
A little far for me to reach

Maybe something else I'm missing
Something good and your the reason
It's a dream but there's a real long wedding

I'm alone in this
I'm as I've always been
Right behind what's happening
She's lost in this
She's like she'll always be
A little far for me to reach

I'm alone in this
I'm as I've always been
Right behind what's happening
She's lost in this
She's like she'll always be
A little far for me to reach
