Devil or angel, I can't make up my mind
Which one you are I'd like to wake up and find
Devil or angel dear, whichever you are
I miss you, I miss you, I-I miss you

Devil or angel please say you'll be mine
Love me or leave me, I'll go out of my mind 
Devil or angel dear, whichever you are
I need you, I need you, I need you

You look like an angel
Your smile is divine
But you keep me guessin'
Will you ever be mine?

Devil or angel please say you'll be mine
Love me or leave, I've made up my mind
Devil or angel dear, whichever you are
I love you, I love you, I-I love you

Devil or angel please say you'll be mine
Love me or leave, I've made up my mind
Devil or angel dear, whichever you are
I love you, I love you, I love you
