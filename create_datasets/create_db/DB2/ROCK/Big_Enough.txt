No time, for weepin' baby
No tears need flow
Let no one tell you
How you should grow, yeah

Stretched to the limit honey
Locked in the hole
Hung out to dry
Still on a roll

Ready, willing, able, and big enough

Run in the front door
Run out the back
Wall in your face and
A gun in your back

No time for weepin' baby
No need for tears
Let no one tell you honey
How you, how you should grow

Big enough
Ready, willing, able, and big enough
