I'm looking down on London
But there's little I can see
'cause I'm living so high up
And it looks so small to me
And I'm feeling so frustrated
'cause the lifts are out once more
And when I get home from work tonight
I gotta climb 14 floors, I tell you mate

14th floor
Oh no, my face don't fit
14th floor Just a number on the council list
14th floor
Oh no, there's nothing to do
14th floor
It's got a roof, it hasn't got a view

I've lived here for seven years now
But I don't know anyone
I think the bloke next door is a Jamaican
But he could be an Irishman
And life's no fun in a tower block
When you're locked behind your door
I think I must have had enough
Of living on the 14th floor, I tell you mate

14th floor
Oh no my face don't fit
14th floor
No no another number on the council list
14th floor

No no no there's nothing to do
14th floor
No no no it hasn't got a view
14th floor
No no no I've really got to go
14th floor
Had enough of yesterday's show
14th floor
Oh no my face don't fit
14th floor
Just a number on the council list
