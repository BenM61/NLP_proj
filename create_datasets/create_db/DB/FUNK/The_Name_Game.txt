I just moved in my new house today
Movin' was hot but I got squared away
Bells started ringin and chains rattled loud
I knew I'd moved in a haunted house

Still I made up in my mind to stay
Nothin' was a gonna drive me away
When I seen somethin' that gave me the creep
Had a one big eye and two big feet

I stood right still and I did the freeze
And he did the stroll right up to me
Made a sound with his feet like a drum
Sayin' you'll be here when the mornin' comes

Say yes I'll be here when the mornin' comes
I'll be right here and I ain't gonna run
I bought this house now you know I'm boss
Ain't no haint gonna run me off

In the kitchen my stove was a blazin' hot
The coffee was a boilin' in the pot
The grease had melted in my pan
I had a hunk of meet in my hand

From out of space there sat a man
On a hot stove was pots and pans
Say that's hot I began to shout
He drank a hot coffee from the spout

He ate the raw meat right from my hand
Drank the hot grease from the fryin' pan
He said to me now you better run
And don't be here when the mornin' comes

Say yes I'll be here when the mornin' comes
I'll be right here and I ain't gonna run
I bought this house now you know I'm boss...
