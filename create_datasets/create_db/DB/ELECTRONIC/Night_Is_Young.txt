Visions of you
Visions of me
Everything we wanted
I wanna be frozen in time
Forever in this moment

How you wanna live?
What you wanna feel?
Don't you know you make me feel
So alive

What you wanna do
What you wanna feel
I know you wanna live your life right

The night is young, and so are we
We can do anything
I wanna baby

The night is young, and so are we
We can be anyone
We wanna be babe

'Cause we are
Free free free free, free free
And life is
Free free free free, free free

Don't worry baby, I'll be here
To make sure you're feeling fine
You can let go of all your fears
'Cause you're not going home tonight

How you wanna live
What you wanna fee
Don't you know u make me feel
So alive

What you wanna do
What you wanna feel
I know you wanna live your life right

The night is young, and so are we
We can do anything
We wanna baby

The night is young, and so are we
We can be anyone
We wanna be babe

'Cause we are
Free free free free, free free
And life is
Free free free free, free free

Baby it's all good
(Baby it's all good)
When I look at you
(When I look at you)
And I see that you
(And I see that you)
Made it through everything
(Made it through everything)
After all of the ups and downs
(All of the ups and down)
We figured it out
(We figured it out)
And I will know
How to ride it out

The night is young, and so are we
We can do anything
We wanna baby

The night is young, and so are we
We can be anyone
We wanna be

'Cause we are
Free free free free, free free
And life is
Free free free free, free free
Free free free free, free free
Free free free free, free free
Free free free free, free free
