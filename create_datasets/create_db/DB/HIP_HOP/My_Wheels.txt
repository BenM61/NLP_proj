Yeah, so brand new
It's a celebration bitches
Him and Chevrolet, him and Chevrolet
Let's go, Joe

24s on the donk go 'round and 'round
'Round and 'round, 'round and 'round
24s on the donk go 'round and 'round
'Round and 'round, 'round and 'round

Brand new 24s on the Chevrolet
I wash 'em up everyday
How do you like my wheels
Check out my wheels, hey

Now everybody smoke but I be higher than the birds go
My donk got big feet, I'm drivin' on the dirt flo'
Now this ain't ya average old school
My paint change faster than the cast of Road Rules

My tires is skinny the rims wide and swole
My sound system like ya life, I got the highs and lows
Ya hear me comin', I'll give you time to hide ya hoes
Be five minutes before ya see me 'cause I'm drivin' slow

Fresher than potpourri be betcha I'm smokin' freely
Leather with oak and TVs matchin' my spokes and peet me
Slow motion like a blimp I glide
And I didn't need Xzibit to Pimp My Ride

Brand new 24s on the Chevrolet
I wash 'em up everyday
How do you like my wheels
Check out my wheels, hey

Brand new 24s on the Chevrolet
I wash 'em up everyday
How do you like my wheels
Check out my wheels, hey

My Chevy Caprice's windows darker than my complexion is
Tinted like you ridin' in the car with the President
And it's sittin' way up in the air, people wave say hey and stare
'Cause my Chevy wheels bigger than the ferris at the fair

They shinin' brighter than the sun I wash 'em from Monday to Sunday
I wax on and wax off like I'm Daniel-san
My roof's missin' on my car, it's topless like a titty bar
I thought I saw my ceiling on the back of a milk carton

Twenty-four inch wires spin Pirellis on my tire's wheel
Enough fuel in my Chevy to start a campfire wit'
The doors open by remote that's why you see no handles
Watch the doors go up like a Lambo

Brand new 24s on the Chevrolet
I wash 'em up everyday
How do you like my wheels
Check out my wheels, hey

Brand new 24s on the Chevrolet

24s on the donk go 'round and 'round
'Round and 'round, 'round and 'round
24s on the donk go 'round and 'round
'Round and 'round, 'round and 'round

I'm addicted to choppin', I tried to stop, I-I-I feel the fiends
'Cause see I love Chevys the way they like a rock
I heard that Kanye West sayin' Jesus Walks
But if He see what I ride, He'll have a reason to drive

Stevie Wonder flow can't see me but you feelin' it
FBI forever Chevy tell 'em who they dealin' wit'

We the young do' slammers wear the crown around town
As the wheels on my donk go 'round and 'round
My speakers hit like Sammy Sosa, got that DJ Magic Mike
Backseat acne bumpin' like Craig Mack's face

Pissin' 'em off me 'cause he sloppy in his jalopy
Until I can sit my Chevrolet on 26s I'll be
Blowin' dro on 24s
That's how all my Field Boys roll

Brand new 24s on the Chevrolet
I wash 'em up everyday
How do you like my wheels
Check out my wheels, hey

Brand new 24s on the Chevrolet
