Hey, what's that thing that you're doing?
Hey, what's that thing that you do?
No, you're not that thing that you're doing
For the things that you do are not who you are

Why don't you come over here?
Why don't you come over here?
Why don't you come over here?
Why don't you come over?

Think of a friend (love)
And wish them love
Think of an enemy (more)
And wish them more

See, see the things that you're doing
See, oh see the things that you do
See the things that you do are not who you are

Why don't you come over here?
Why don't you come over here?
Why don't you come over here?
Why don't you come over?

Think of a friend (love)
And wish them love
Think of an enemy (more)
And wish them more
Think of an enemy (love)
Like them, wish them all your love

Then feel the love return
Feel the love infinity
Feel the love infinity
Then let it go

Let the love go
Oh, let the love go
Oh, let the love go
Oh, let the love go

Feel the love go
Feel the love go
Feel the love then go
Feel the love then go

Feel the love go (love go)
Feel the love go (the love go)
Feel the love go (go-o)
Feel the love go (love go)

Love go, yeah feel the love go
Yeah feel the love go, go
Yeah feel the love go, oh
Yeah feel the love go, go
Yeah feel the love go, go, oh oh oh oh oh
