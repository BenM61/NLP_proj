Wild and free is the way I wanna be
Making a new day
Leading in a new way

Respect for those people
Power to the people
Setting down the old crew
Bringing in the brand new
Wild and free with peace finally

Wild and free is the way I want my life
Natures wait for me
Without pain in its stride

Fighting what is wrong
Across the world as well as home
But respect for everybody's right
Would be really out of sight

Our great obligations
Would not be bad situation
If the young what we listen to
For what they really know is true

Respect for those people
Power to the people
The old people who worry 'bout me
'Cause I am so wild and free

Wild and free is the way I wanna be
Making a new day
Leading in a new way
Respect for those people
Power to the people
