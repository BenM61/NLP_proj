In my hand, you might see
Something special that she gave to me
And in my head you might find
Something special that she left behind

And you will see
Your eyes light up again like mine
And you will see
That after all this time
I almost made you smile

Through my life I have seen
This love come and go
There's no in-between
And in my dreams
I have seen something
Altogether more serene

And you will see
Your eyes light up again like mine
And you will see
The fever run through life
And you will see
The sky turn blue with all your light
And you will see
That after all this time,
I almost made you smile

Could you feel like this again
Show me something?

I almost made you smile
