We're building a home on the side of a mountain
Above the clouds, next to the sky
And after our labors the stars will be neighbors
We'll take our place with them in space

We're not using concrete or plaster or wood 
They'd lower the tone of our new neighborhood
And mortar will crumble with age and neglect
We're building our home upon love and respect
And when we've built it we'll call it Andromeda Heights
When we've built it we'll call it Andromeda Heights
When we've built it we'll call it Andromeda Heights

We're building a home on the side of a mountain
Above the clouds, next to the sky
Our plans are ambitious, a blueprint of wishes
That will come true and when they do

Folks in the valley will look up and say
"You've finally built it can we come and stay ?"
And cynics will marvel and say "we confess,
There were times when we thought it was just an address !
But now that we've seen it we know it's Andromeda Heights
Now we've seen it we know it's Andromeda Heights
Now we've seen it we know it's Andromeda Heights."

We're building a home on the side of a mountain
Above the clouds, next to the sky
And after our labors the stars will be neighbors
We'll take our place with them in space
