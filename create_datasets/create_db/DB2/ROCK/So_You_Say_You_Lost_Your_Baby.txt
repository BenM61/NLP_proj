Well you're smolderin' with fly words,
Catch the moment on the run
And you say there's nothin' easy
About the plywood tract you're from
And you stand inside your wind stilts
Watch the sentence act begun

So you say you lost your baby
Do you know that your the one
With the stand to watch the trials go,
From here to there behind the scene
Throw your troubles to the moon trolls
To swallow up like stormy dreams
Take an entrance to a stand-off,
Looking if there's such a strife

And you say you lost your baby,
Wondering if its in your life
Well you fly your banners Mondays,
That take a rise and fall in one
Ask the questions of the pilgrims,
As they come to pledge what's done
Claim a tabernacle hillside
Where you'll sight the dyin' sun

So you say you lost your baby,
Don't you know that you're the one.
So you say you lost your baby,
Do you know that you're the one.
