Take your shoes off, let your hair down
Time for you to get away
Don't you worry 'bout tomorrow
Are you gonna miss today?

Sometimes the madness gets you crazy, yeah
Sends you looking for a place to hide
Start you thinking that you never
Get yourself some piece of mind

But you can do it, you can do it
You can do it to your hearts delight
If you can do it with your imagination
Then you can do it in real life

Feel the magic of the moment
Let your spirit carry you away
Get in touch with all your feelings
Find out what they have to say

Sometimes the madness gets you crazy
That you're looking for a place to hide
Starts you thinking that you'll never
Gonna get yourself some peace of mind

But you can do it, oh, you can do it
You can do it to your hearts delight
If you can do it with your imagination
Then you can do it in real life

Feel as free as an eagle
Flying the whole world high in the sky
You'll touch the fires of love inside you
You've be looking to find

You can do it, you can do it
You can do it to your hearts delight
If you can do it with your imagination
Then you can do it, can do it, oh

Yeah, do it, c'mon do it
Oh do it, yeah

You gotta believe it, oh, believe it
Do it, do it, you can do it, you can do it
Take it easy, you gotta believe
If you want it you can have it
You can do it in real life

Do it, you can do it
You can do it to your hearts delight
If you can do it with your imagination
Then you can do it in real life
Yeah, do it
