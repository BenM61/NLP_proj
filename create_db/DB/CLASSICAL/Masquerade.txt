So long I've been
Puttin' all my effort into you
My heart is bare
I've been lookin' everywhere for truth
You know exactly what you're doing to me
That's okay 'cause I'm not playin' any more

[Chorus]
I see what you're tryin' to hide
Didn't take me long to realize
You can't fool me with your disguise
I can see right through your lyin' eyes
Take your shot, push me around
You're never gonna take me down
So get outta my face with your masquerade

Since I've moved on
Things are goin' every way but wrong
It's a brighter day (whisper) across the sky
A new life, new friends
It's got me wonderin' where I've been
I was in a haze
I know you're still bearin' down on me
That's okay 'cause I'm not runnin' any more

[Chorus]

When it all comes down
You won't have control over me
You can shape it how you want
But you have been revealed

[Chorus: x2]
