building the db:
1. tried a-z lyrics, then another 10+ apis/ websites. then used Lyrics.com
2. backup our files in text files, then upgraded to pickle
3. the songs we use have reasonable names and are only in English (had to remove some of the early songs we added to ensure that)


todo:
1. no songs with over 3/4 tags
2. preprocess-
  2.1. chorus/ repeat
  2.2. too many dots --> "..."
  2.3. all files and with "\n"
  2.4. all files are divided to verses(?)
3. remove classical songs
