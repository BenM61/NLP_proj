Get it up get it out get it in time
Hang it up hanging out hanging on a big thing
Move it in move it out move up the line
Bang it up bang it out banging on a big thing.

Brothers and sisters let me hear it
(Get it up, get it on, get it in time)
Give me the green light and watch me move it
(Move it up, move it out, move up the line)
This is temptation, power rotation
Give me the friction and watch me make it
(Make it up, making out, making it slide).

So glad you came along
This time you won't be wrong
You love to turn it on
And you're not the only one.

Get it up get it out get it in time
Hang it up hanging out hanging on a big thing
Move it in move it out move up the line
Bang it up bang it out banging on a big thing.

Brothers and sisters we can take it
(Shake it up, shake it out, shake it all the time)
Give me the suction and we can stick it
(Lick it up, suck it up, stick it outside)
This is temptation (station)
Power rotation (to station)
Give me the play list and watch me eat it
(Eat it up, beat it up, beat it in time)

So glad you came along
This time you won't be wrong
You love to turn it on
And you're not the only one.
