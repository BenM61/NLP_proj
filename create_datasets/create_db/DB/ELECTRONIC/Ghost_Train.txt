Here they come to steal my soul 
Ghost train 
Wait it out until I know 
Ghost train 
Trying not to feel like,
Ghost train 
Moving up until I go go 
Ghost train 
She was not,
Ghost train 
Trying to hear in my heart 
Ghost train 
Trying not to feel like,
Ghost train 
Moving up until I'm taught to your side 
Ghost train 

Yeah yeah yeah 
Ghost train 

Got suicide for my baby 
Ghost train 
Living up until I'm,
Ghost train 
Seeing like I'm,
Ghost train 
Moving up and taught I'm a weapon 
Ghost train 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
Ghost train 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
Ghost train 
I see myself pretend how to get there 
Ghost train 
Down a poisoned,
Ghost train 

Come on come on come on! 
Ghost train! 
Come on come on come on! 
Ghost train train train 

Got suicide for my baby 
Ghost train 
Living up until I,
Ghost train 
Seeing like I'm,
Ghost train 
Moving up and taught I'm a weapon 
Ghost train 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
Ghost train 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
Ghost train 
I see myself pretend how to get there 
Ghost train 
Down a poisoned,
Ghost train 

(middle bit)

Come on come on come on! 
Ghost train! 
Come on come on come on! 
Ghost train!
