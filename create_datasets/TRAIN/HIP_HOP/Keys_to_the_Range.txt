You've changed
you're not the girl that used to do things
The way I like it it's a damn shame
You was on your way to the house, money, keys, to the range
You've changed
you're not the girl that used to do things
The way I like it it's a damn shame
You was on your way to the house, money, keys, to the range

Say what the dilly yo?
Said uh, won't you tell me sumthin I didn't know
Do you got plans to be with me
Then why'd you flip the script on me
I need to know if you're the one
I can take around the world
So tell me tell me tell me baby
Why do you change??

You've changed
you're not the girl that used to do things
The way I like it it's a damn shame
You was on your way to the house, money, keys, to the range
You've changed
you're not the girl that used to do things
The way I like it it's a damn shame
You was on your way to the house, money, keys, to the range

I know you're feeling low
Now that you're thinking about the things that you let go
I know you're mad but uh
I'm kinda glad cuz uh
Look what you had and you still let it go away
Baby why shouldn't I be happy
I lost what I thought was close to me
I should have known that you're not right for me

You've changed
you're not the girl that used to do things
The way I like it it's a damn shame
You was on your way to the house, money, keys, to the range
You've changed
you're not the girl that used to do things
The way I like it it's a damn shame
You was on your way to the house, money, keys, to the range

I can't believe
Just when I thought you had me
Then you turned around changed the game on me
My fantasy
You've gotta put the work in, the work in
If you wanna be with me

All I remember was the relationship that was hot and strong
Please I need you to tell me where it all went wrong
Now was it my friends or your friends
Or was it the fact that you received a jag when you wanted a benz
Sound crazy?
I've seen hang-ups like that
I mean shit, something made you change up like that
I used to bang out your back, so ain't no way in hell
I kept you with a stack so I know very well
You never missed a meal and got everything you dreamed
Had me like, 'it's for real' bout to jump through a ring
White 10 carats and nothing but bling bling
And the right to tell me not to hit the scene
You wanna give that up?
What is it? Do I work too much?
Did the playa just lose his touch?
I mean it can't be that, I'm just shootin out things
I thought you was the one but damn you changed

You've changed
you're not the girl that used to do things
The way I like it it's a damn shame
You was on your way to the house, money, keys, to the range
You've changed
you're not the girl that used to do things
The way I like it it's a damn shame
You was on your way to the house, money, keys, to the range
