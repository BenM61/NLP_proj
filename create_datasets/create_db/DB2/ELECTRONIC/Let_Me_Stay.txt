You want changes, I'll make changes...
You've got those feelings deep inside
Rise on up
Then come alive
So baby please try to believe me
I feel you're messing with my heart
Sometimes you want to call or meet me
You will find
An open door
And wonder, and came to see me
I think your messing with my heart.
I want to know each time the feelings you can share
You want changes, I'll make changes...
Now I won't let you down...

Let me stay
Let me stay
Let me stay
One more day

You are the meaning of my life
Wake me up
I see the light
You know that you are on my mind and
As if you whip into my head
Sometimes you just pretend to see me
Every time
You hurt me more
I wonder if you really need me
And now you whip into my head
I want to know each time the feelings you can share
You want changes, I'll make changes...
Now I won't let you down...

Let me stay
Let me stay
Let me stay
One more day
Let me stay
Let me stay
Let me stay
One more day...
