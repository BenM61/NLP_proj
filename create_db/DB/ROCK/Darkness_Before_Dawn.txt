The lore of elders passes judgment on this waste
And finding me or them does lack accepting fate
And as the moments pass another face arrives
We watch them come and go with speed of passing clouds

Forbidden fruits of dreams that rule our thoughts my love
Of lands untouched and ways to come always maybe
But choking on promises meant for the deal
Thinking again the darkest hour before the dawn

Confirming fears that from the dawn of time have been
Retracing footsteps in dark chambers of grey lands
And through the madness through the terror we must pass
As if awaiting sunlight that may never come

In time we face ourselves with all our faults and fears
Now that I know the final conflict is within
I recognize the faces of my friends and hear the call
"Come journey, journey with me through the darkest hour"
