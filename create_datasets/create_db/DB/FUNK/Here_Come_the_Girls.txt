Here come the girls (girls, girls, girls-girls)
Here come the girls (girls, girls, girls-girls)

Looking so good, it's a darn god shame, that they couldn't all be mine
Looking so pretty, it's a darn god pretty, oh, you're looking so fine (fine)

Look out, blood, let me get further, little closer to the one I love
Anything better than the opposite sex, they must-a kept it up above

Here come the girls (girls, girls, girls-girls)
Here come the girls (girls, girls, girls-girls)

I can live without coffee, I can live without tea
And I'm livid about the honeybee
I'm not a fillet steak
I can leave or take
But the girls are part of me

And oh, water
I don't need no lemonade
But to live without girls
I can't live without girls
It's like a man with a hole in his head

Here come the girls
Here come the girls
Here come the girls (girls, girls, girls-girls)
Here come the girls (girls, girls, girls-girls)

Bored out of my head (hey)
While the foxes do their thing (hoo-hoo-hoo)
You make me feel so good inside
I got to jump up and say (aah)

Naa, naa, naa, naa
Naa, naa, naa naa
Naa, naa, naa, naa
Naa-naa-nana-na
Naa, naa, naa, naa
Naa, naa-nana, na
Naa, naa, naa, naa
Naa-naa-nana-na

Ooh-ooh
I'm not saying I could live on love alone
Ooh-ooh
That's the only thing that turn me on
Ooh-ooh
I was born to be free, just once
Freedom of choice rang that bell
Give all the girls to me

Here come the girls
(Girls, girls, girls)
Here come the girls
(Girls, girls, girls)
Here come the girls
(Ooh, water)
Here come the girls
(I don't need no lemonade)
Here come the girls
(Girls)
Here come the girls
Here come the girls
Here come the girls
