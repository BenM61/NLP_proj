All I can give you, is my very best
And when I do that, I ain't gonna worry about the rest

I couldn't give you everything that you wanted
I couldn't give you everything that you need
But when it comes down to giving you, true love
You never mind it always here to please

Hey, give me some credit where it's due, honey
Give me some credit where it's due now, baby
Give me some credit where it's due
'Cause, all I due to say for you, yeah, yeah

I couldn't give you everything that you wanted
I couldn't give you everything that you need
But when it comes down to giving you true love
You never mind it always here to please

Hey, give me some credit where it's due, honey
Give me some credit where it's due, baby
Give me some credit where it's due
Call out to all I do to say for you, yeah, yeah

All I can give is my very best
And after I do that, mmm
I ain't thinking about the rest

Have you ever came to me and I, I turned you to dust?
Have you ever asked a favor and I, I turned you around?
Have you ever asked me for something that I, that I wouldn't do?
Ain't good loving that I been giving you, baby

Now ain't it the truth?
Didn't, yeah, didn't it, hold me, didn't it, oh
Give me some credit where it's due, honey
Give me some credit where it's due
