It happened innocently you gave your love to me
Who could blame us? That night I was so late coming in
Who could blame us? I couldn't explain exactly where I'd been

But your mama shouldn't have told you
Your mama shouldn't have told you
Babies were made in heaven

It was splendor in the grass it happened so fast
Who could blame us? We were so close I could hardly catch my breath
Who could blame us? The moment was real happiness

But your mama shouldn't have told you

Feelings come so strong too young
Feelings come and before long you're a victim

This love story is true it didn't change me and you
Who could blame us? Although it happened way back then
Who could blame us? We'll be together till the end

But your mama shouldn't have told you
Babies were made in heaven
Babies were made in heaven
Your mama shouldn't have told you

Your mama shouldn't have told you
Babies were made in heaven
Babies were made in heaven
Babies were made in heaven
Babies were made in heaven
