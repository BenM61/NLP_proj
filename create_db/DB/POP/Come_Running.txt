By the side of the tracks where the train goes by
The wind and the rain will catch you, you will sigh
Deep in your heart
Then you'll come a-running to me, mmm
You'll come a-running to me, yeah-yeah
Well, you watch the train go 'round the bend
Play in dust and dream that it will never end
Deep in your heart
But you'll come a-running to me, yeah
You'll come a-running to me, all right
Said, hey, come a-running to me
Oh, come a-running to me
Yeah-yeah, come a-running to me
Said, hey, come a-running to me
Oh, come a-running to me
Hey, yeah, come a-running to me
With your hound dog by your side
And your arms stretched out open wide
I want to keep you satisfied in the morning sun
By my side, come on, come on run, all right, hey, hey
In the country
Kicking sand up with your heels
Think to yourself how good it feels
Throw away all your walking shoes
Then you come running to me
Hey, hey, now you come running to me
I said, hey, come a-running to me
Oh, come a-running to me
Hey, yeah, come a-running to me
Hey, come a-running to me
Oh, come a-running to me
Hey, yeah, come a-running to me
Come on, come on, run (hey, come a-running to me)
Wanna run, come on, run (oh, come a-running to me)
Come on run, come on, come on, run to me (hey, come a-running to me)
You gotta rainbow if you run to me
