There's a kid with a golden arm
He admits to the forest fire
That he started up from a lack of something better going on

This kid with the golden arm 
He admits to the forest fire
That he started up from a lack of something better going on
Tell your friends it's a four alarm 
Just a smoke screen we're all liars
Better to stew in discontent then to admit we?re wrong

Our motivations out to sea
And our ideas they die so quickly 

This town has good hearts 
Bad blood emotional scars
Never get to say what you really want to say 

This town has good hearts 
Bad blood emotional scars
Never get to say what you really want to say 

We all lie so well 
We all lie so well

There's a kid with a golden arm
He admits to the forest fire
That he started up from a lack of something better going on
Tell your friends it's a four alarm 
Just a smoke screen we're all liars
Better to stew in discontent then to admit we?re wrong

If misery loves company 
Then it seems to swim so much more forcibly
In the song of other peoples failures 

Doctor do you have a remedy
Doctor this is not alright by me
Do you think that you have the strength for the city
That sells fantasy

We all lie so well 
We all lie so well
