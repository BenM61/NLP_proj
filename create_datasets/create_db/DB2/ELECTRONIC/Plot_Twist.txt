I thought you were someone to trust
Get tough, grow up, be straight up
But no, you've been showing me
You're the best that I've ever had
Or you're the best lie I've never heard

Oh whoa oh, shots fired
You're just a hype, no better work on that hype, bro
Oh whoa oh, shots fired better work on that hype, bro

Do you need me to spell it out loud?
You screwed it up plot twist, moved on and now you want me
To play games like a wannabe
Tough luck, you're kidding yourself
Plot twist, moved on and now you want me
You're playing games like a wannabe

Like a wannabe, like a wannabe
Shots fired
I-I-I-I don't want it, I-I-I-I don't want it

Tick-tock, tick-tock, we're overdue
But if you're gonna crack my heart, do it in two
Give me a show
Still that's a no from me
You're getting pushed out of my priority

Oh whoa oh, shots fired
You're just a hype, no better work on that hype, bro
Oh whoa oh, shots fired better work on that hype, bro

Do you need me to spell it out loud?
You screwed it up plot twist, moved on and now you want me
To play games like a wannabe (shots fired, fired)
Tough luck, you're kidding yourself
Plot twist, moved on and now you want me
You're playing games like a wannabe

Like a wannabe, like a wannabe
Shots fired
I-I-I-I don't want it, I-I-I-I don't want it

Better work, and you wanna be, better work on that
Better work on that hype, bro, and you wanna be, oh
Better work, better work on that
Better work on that hype, bro, yeah, you still wanna be
Better work, better work on that
Better work on that hype, bro
And now you want me

Do you need me to spell it out loud?
You screwed it up plot twist, moved on and now you want me
To playing games like a wannabe (shots fired, fired)
Tough luck, you're kidding yourself
Plot twist, moved on and now you want me
You're playing games like a wannabe

Like a wannabe, like a wannabe
Shots fired
I-I-I-I don't want it, I-I-I-I don't want it
