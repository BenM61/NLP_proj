Watching it's my life
Look in my eyes
Open your mouth
And tell me your lies
Treat me better
You should treat me better

Doing me anything
Doing me good
Asking your questions, that's understood
Treat me better 
Treat me better 

That's all I want from you 
That's all I want from you 
That's all I want from you 
That's all I want from you 
That's all I want from you 
That's all I want from you 
That's all I want from you 
That's all I want from you 
Years gone by
Come back to the place
Thinking by the time, follow my own dreams
Treat me better 
Treat me better 

Late night phone calls, people hanging up
Do you know the devil?
The reason is stuff
Treat me better 
Treat me better 

It's all I want from you 
It's all I want from you 
It's all I want from you 
It's all I want from you 
It's all I want from you 
It's all I want from you 
It's all I want from you 
It's all I want from you
