When you see me on ya block, call the police
Let them motherfuckers no here come the beast
Oh, in the late night hour

Straight out of Compton, a crazy motherfucker named ice cube
And I'm rollin' with the motherfuckin' Neptune's
When I'm caught off, I got a sawed off
A midget bitch that'll suck a niggas balls off
You too girl if ya f*ck with me
I'm gettin' head in the lane doin' sixty
About to crash like teddy pendergrass
Mama said a hard head make a tender ass

To all the dogs that bark a lot
Who don't give a f*ck if it's dark or not
We'll be creepin' in the parking lot
Motherfuckers don't know if I can park or not
'Cause I circle like vultures, la costa nostra
What's yo name, what's yo number and ya culture
You need nuts in yo face like a poster
Bumpin' all the baddest bitches like I'm 'posed to

If you in a club nigga then shit bang
If you on the streets nigga then shit bang
And if it's what ya need boy, do ya thang
If you on the block nigga then shit bang
If you in that 600 then shit bang
If you in a range rov then shit bang
If you on that steel horse then shit bang
But if it's what ya need boy, let it bang

F*ck the police comin' straight from the underground
Fuckin' pig wanna act like he like me now
In 86 same bitch tried to lock me down
And motherfuckers wanna ask why I'm cocky now
To all the bitches that think they bootylicious
I think they nutritious, I think they do dishes
I'm makin' three wishes or takin' they pictures
And spendin' they riches and fuckin' they bitches

Ice cube's an asshole and it ain't a knack
Egomaniac, lil' homies call me brainiac
So take a hit of that and remember that
Where my motherfuckin' niggas and my bitches at
In the late night hour hit the front to back
Check the motherfuckin' rims on the Cadillac
On the ass attack, can you keep it tight
And if the head right, nigga there every night

If you in a club nigga then shit bang
If you on the streets nigga then shit bang
And if it's what ya need boy, do ya thang
If you on the block nigga then shit bang
If you in that 600 then shit bang
If you in a range rov then shit bang
If you on that steel horse then shit bang
But if it's what ya need boy, let it bang

This is for my niggas that's schemin' for cash
And lookin' for ass in the late night hour
This is for my people that's countin' they riches
And pickin' up bitches in the late night hour
This is for my niggas that's countin' they cash
And lookin' for ass in the late night hour
And pickin' up bitches in the late night hour

So check it and everybody get naked
But respect it cause I could do it all night playa
I'm all fight playa, you all spite playa
It's all right playa, a nigga might care
But to catch me you gotta do a light year
Baby go ahead please do the damn thang
Ice cube insane in the membrane

We gonna get chu' high nigga
Our rhymes will get chu' by nigga
Tell me if I qualify nigga
I wanna get that, cop that, buy that, drive that
To bail in like super fly
You want it too but don't know where to start at
Fuckin' with me, nigga better bring his hard hat
Nigga where ya heart at, leave ya on the tarmac

Where my top at and my nigga mack
Ridin' shotgun, with the top gun
Don't catch a hot one soon as he spot one
Westside connection is a doctrine
This ain't another club song
Or love song that y'all can f*ck on
So get the f*ck on
A nigga rich can't believe the bullshit that I'm stuck on

If you in a club nigga then shit bang
If you on the streets nigga then shit bang
And if it's what ya need boy, do ya thang
If you on the block nigga then shit bang
If you in that 600 then shit bang
If you in a range rov then shit bang
If you on that steel horse then shit bang
But if it's what ya need boy, let it bang
