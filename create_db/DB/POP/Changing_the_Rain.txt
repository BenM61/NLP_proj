Over closer through figures collide
Open eyes to awake
Wilder through the better days
Go silent,
See them running around changing the rain
Gold is colder than ice
More is more than you can take
Open your eyes

Oh out here don't you ever know
Oh out here don't you ever know better

Now among the wild hills open they lie
For diamond tears we could ride
If only you'd get back in time
Open your eyes

Oh out here don't you ever know
Oh out here don't you ever know better

I can only happen I and I want it back again
I could only happen I and I'd want you back again
If only you'd get back in time
Open your eyes
Open your eyes
