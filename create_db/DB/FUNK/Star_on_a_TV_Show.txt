You ought to be
The star on a TV show
Then all the world would know
Why I love you so

You ought to be
A queen on a movie screen
Starring in every scene
Then they'd know what I mean

If you were a car you would be a big Jaguar
Racing along with the sun
If you were a song then the country would sing along
Baby, you'd be number one

If were the news
You'd be the latest
What I'm trying to say is
Baby, you're the greatest

You ought to be
The star on a TV show
Then all the world would know
Why I love you so

You ought to be
A queen on a movie screen
Starring in every scene
Then they'd know what I mean

If you were a car you would be a big Jaguar
Racing along with the sun
If you were a song then the country would sing along
Baby, you'd be number one

If were the news
You'd be the latest
What I'm trying to say is
Baby, you're the greatest

You ought to be
The star on a TV show
Then all the world would know
The magic of you

And they would love you too
But not half as much as I do
No, not half as much as I do
