Memphis in June
A shady veranda under a Sunday blue sky
Memphis in June
And cousin Amanda's makin' a rhubarb pie
I can hear the clock inside tickin' and a-tockin'
Everything is peacefully dandy
I can see old granny cross the street, still a-rockin'
Watching the neighbors go by
Memphis in June
With sweet oleander blowing perfume in the air
Up jumps the moon to make it that much grander
It's paradise, brother take my advice
Nothing's half as nice as Memphis in June

Memphis in June

Up jumps the moon to make it that much grander
It's paradise, brother take my advice
Nothing's half as nice as Memphis in June
