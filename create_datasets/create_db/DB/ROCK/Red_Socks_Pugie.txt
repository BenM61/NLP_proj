She said, these wasp's nests in your head
These wasp's nests, these terminals in your head
These heart swells, these contacts in your head

Oh help no, these vessels
Our heart swells on these vessels
Our heart swells up, let's make them explode

Oh help no, these vessels
Our heart swells on these vessels
Our heart swells up let's make them explode

Oh, what the hell, she should've said
Oh, what the hell, we should've said
Our heart swells up, let's make them explode

These wasp's nests, these contacts in your head
Once again...
We could set it on fire for them
We could set it on fire for them
We could set it on fire for them
We could set it on fire for them, for them, for them, for them

Oh help no, these vessels
Our heart swells on these vessels
Our heart swells up let's make them explode

Oh, what the hell, she should've said
Oh, what the hell, we should've said
Our heart swells up, let's make them explode

Oh help no, these vessels
Our heart swells on these vessels
Our heart swells up let's make them explode

Oh what the hell,
We set it on fire
We set it on fire
We set it on fire
