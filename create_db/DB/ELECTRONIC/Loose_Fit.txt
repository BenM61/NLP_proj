Has to be a loose fit, has to be a loose fit
Go on move in it, go on do your bit
Small or big, take your pick
Doesn't have to be legit
It's gotta be a loose fit, it's gotta be a loose fit

Don't need no skin types in my wardrobe today
Fold them all up an' put them all away
Won't be no misfit in my household today
Pick 'em all up an' send them on his way

Do what you're doin', say what you're sayin'
Go where you're goin', think what you're thinkin'
Sounds good to me

Don't know what you saw
But you know it's against the law
And you know that you want some more
I've heard it all before

Gonna buy an air force base
Gonna wipe out your race
Get stoned in a different place
Don't you know, I got better taste

Do what you're doin', say what you're sayin'
Go where you're goin', think what you're thinkin'
Sounds good to me

Do what you're doin', spend what you're ownin'
Pay what you're payin', look where you're goin'
Say what you're thinkin', kill who you're killin'
Sing if you're singin', speak if you're speakin'
Sounds good to me
