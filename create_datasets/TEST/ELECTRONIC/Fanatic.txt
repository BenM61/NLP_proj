When I wake up all I want is for him to take me away 
To that incredible comfort zone inside that beautiful place 
When I need to release tension so that I can feel brand new 
Reach that height that only one in this whole world can take me to 

All the time I want you baby, 
All the time I need you honey, 
All the time I gotta have you sugar, 
Because I'm addicted - oh yeah. 
All the time I want you baby, 
All the time I need you honey, 
All the time I gotta have you sugar, 
It belongs to me 

I'm fanatically, addicted see, the way that he be loving me 
It's like a drug or some bad habbit 
Since its mine, I got to have it 

I'm fanatically, addicted see, the way that he be loving me 
It's like a drug or some bad habbit 
Since its mine, I got to have it 

Oh it feels like, like I've never had it right 
Before this, 
There was so much emotional pain, nothing positive to gain 
But I'm loved, full, and completely now 
Not just a physical thang 
But it's something spiritual 

I just gotta have it, I'm a fanatic
I just gotta have it, I'm a fanatic
I just gotta have it, I'm a fanatic
I just gotta have it, I'm a fanatic
