Hear me spit on you wither I
Remold into gold and bury I from Sun

Reborn left to sigh, recure maybe I'll 
Be born and simplify the way I lie before 

I get bored
I get bored
I get bored
I'm bored 

Repent by you and trust to figure out
I burn that gift to doll and let it shine before

I get bored
I get bored
I get bored
I wish for a real one

Fit and confide, before me or I
I will come clean, it gets worse, it's more

Get bored
I get bored
I get bored
A wish for a real one

Get bored
Get bored
Get bored
I wish for a real one
