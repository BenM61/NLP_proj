Come on go with me, babe
Come on go with me, girl
Baby, let's go
To the cabin down below

I got a radio
Put it on soft and low
Baby, let's go
To the cabin down below

Well, I've had my eye on you
For a long, long time
I'm watching everything you do
Baby, you're gonna be mine

Come on go with me, babe
Come on go with me, girl
Baby, let's go
To the cabin down below

Time's been moving slow
Since we both got here
Come on slide a little closer
Let me whisper in your ear

Well I got a radio
Turn it on soft and low
Baby, let's go
To the cabin down below

Oh, baby, let's go
To the cabin down below
Baby, let's love
In the cabin down below
