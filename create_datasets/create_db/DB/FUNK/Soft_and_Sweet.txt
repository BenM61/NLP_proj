Chilling out on a ridge, by the sea, in a ranchido
Cool breeze through the trees sings a song so sweet
For my baby and my boo boo
Asleep they lay
So I picked up my guitar and then I start to play
The music was pulsing blood up to my eyes
I surmised the horizon, sun rising, surprising the hell out
Of the clouds
Like they were kissed for the first time.
The sun was steady rising and I'm sitting in the sunshine

I hear my baby crying and he's just waking up
So I walk through the screen door and I go pick him up
Rocka, rocka, rocka, rocka, rocka, rocka back and forth
Baby quit crying then I'll go and play some more

[Chorus: ]
Soft and sweet melodies while your momma's sleeping
Let her sleep in late this morning
Let her sleep 'til the sun is burning down
Burning down down down

Baby baby hold my fingers with your little tiny hands
While we lounge in a hammock checking out all the land
I smell the sweet scents of papaya and lime
I smell the ocean breezes, the salt
And my mind is captivated by your big brown eyes
Which remind me of mine
Now I know we're two of a kind
Rocka, rocka, rocka, rocka, rocka, rocka back and forth
Baby quit crying then I'll go and play some more

[Chorus: ]

The day is getting brighter and the wind is breezing down
The whole tree is shaking, fallen fruit is on the ground
I smile when I'm thinking about the love I've found
Momma's still sleeping so we play these mellow sounds

[Chorus: ]

Burning down, burning down, burning down
