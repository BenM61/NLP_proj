If your mind seeds so many questions
Misery is never gone astray
Your trail, my thought, what an awkward
System to be playing on the brain
My make-up, the pillow when I wake up
Stains in a way that seems to drown me
It's rude to point but attention's what I want
And she told me that I look like David Bowie

It's all in my mind now
But I can't help thinking why it's so so quiet
When I woke up it was like this
What a colorful day I have been welcomed with

Still in focus I wanted you to notice
Everything I'm trying to improve
Up early, I'm telling you a story
So look at me when I'm talking to you
A private number, I'm curiously under
The impression that I'm subject to surveillance
So tragic, I'm mixed up in the magic
And everybody's trying to make a difference

It's all in my mind now
But I can't help thinking why you're so so quiet
When I woke up it was like this
What a colorful day I have been welcomed with

You never wanted anything more
Are you, so clever, wanted everything more

It's all in my mind now
But I can't help thinking why you're so so quiet
When I woke up it was like this
What a colourful day I have been welcomed with
