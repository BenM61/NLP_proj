Will you kindly take the floor
And tell us what Kansas is thinking
And what is Kansas for?"

We stand behind the little man
And we need a firehouse in Topeka
So help us if you can"

"I see the delegate from Utah
Our friendly Beehive State
How can we help you, Utah?
How can we make you great?"

So we can get some things to grow
And we got to tell this country about Utah
`Cause nobody seems to know
