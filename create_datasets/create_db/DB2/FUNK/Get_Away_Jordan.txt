Get away, Jordan
Get away, Jordan
Get away, Jordan
There's one more river to cross

And that's the stream that flows
Through Bethlehem called the river Jordan
Don't you want to, God Almighty?
O my Lord

Get away, Jordan
Get away, Jordan
Get away, Jordan
I want to cross over to see my Lord

One of these mornings bright and fair
I want to cross over to see my Lord
Going to take my wings and fly the air
I want to cross over to see my Lord
