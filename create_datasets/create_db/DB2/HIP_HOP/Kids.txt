Hey Jason
How are you my friend?
Hey Jason
I wonder how you've been?

Do you remember that day
When we were hanging out
Early one morning before school
And then I let you down

Hey Michael
How are you my friend?
Hey Michael
How the hell have you been?

Do you remember that time
Way back when we were nine
You tried to be my good friend
And yet I turned you in

Kids will try to run you over
Kids will try to bring you down
Kids will never say they're sorry
Kids back then are older now

Hey Kerri
How are you my friend?
Hey Kerri
I wonder how you've been?

Do you remember that night
When you and I went out
I was wrong and apologize
I won't forget that night
