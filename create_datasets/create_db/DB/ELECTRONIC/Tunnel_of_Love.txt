consequences altered cases
broken noses altered faces
my ego altered altered egos
wherever i go so does me go
walk through the fields where the flowers are growing
carve out your names on the first tree you see
there are 22 catches when you strike your matches
and get down on your knees

in the tunnel of love - the tunnel of love
you fall in feet first - in the tunnel of love
you think of yourselves as really good friends
but you know how it always ends
in the tunnel of love

so you get engaged have a party
only 17 when the wedding bells changer
a room with a view and a kid on the way
hope you make it to the church on time
cause the wedding list is getting longer
the bottom drawer is getting fuller
and you're not getting any younger
can things get any better

in the tunnel of love - the tunnel of love
you fall in feet first - in the tunnel of love
and think of yourselves as really good friends
but you know how it always ends
in the tunnel of love, the tunnel of love

so consequences altered cases
you tried honeymoons in far away places
but the trial separation worked and
ended up in a divorce case
you gave up your friends for a new way of life
and both ended up as ex husband and wife
there were 22 catches when you struck your matches
and threw away your life in the tunnel of love
the tunnel of love you fell i feet first
in the tunnel of love and thought of yourselves as really good friends
but you know how it had to end in the tunnel of love
the tunnel of love, the tunnel of love
the tunnel of love, the tunnel of love
the tunnel of love, in the tunnel of love
