Driving with your handbrake on
But you can't smell the burning
Colliding with oblivion
Just to keep heads turning
Man I want some pretty cash
It's ugly all that saving

'Cause we could get so fabulous
When we're out Rolex raving
No craving

Oh we're way beyond our means
To buy these crazy things
Oh we're wasting our whole lives
In a struggle to survive

Get yourself in debt for me
The Grass don't get no greener
Have it all so far upfront
It doesn't take a dreamer,
a beamer

Oh we're way beyond our means
We love these spending sprees
Oh we're wasting all our time
On some production line

Diving down the rubbish chute
We'll be OK if we uproot
'Cause I don't need no heavy
family
Holding me

Oh we're way beyond our means
To buy these crazy things
Oh we're making them Swiss
Francs
To burst there private banks
Oh we're way beyond our means
We love these spending sprees
Oh we're wasting our whole lives
In a struggle to survive
