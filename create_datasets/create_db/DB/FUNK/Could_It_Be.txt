Since I met you I've begun to feel so strange
Every time I speak your name (that's funny)
You say that you are so helpless too
That you don't know what to do
 
Each night I pray there will never come a day
When you up and take your love away
Say you feel the same way too and I wonder what
It is I feel for you
 
Could it be I'm falling in love (witcha baby)
Could it be I'm falling in love (ooh)
Could it be I'm falling in love
With you, with you  with you, with you
 
I don't need all those things that used to bring me joy
You made me such a happy boy
And honey you'll always be the only one for me
Meeting you was my destiny
You can be sure I will never let you down
When you need me I will be around
And darling you'll always be the only one for me
Heaven made you specially

[Chorus] 
 
Each night I pray there will never come a day
When you up and take your love away
Say you feel the same way too and I wonder what
It is I feel for you
 
[Chorus]
 
Could it be I'm falling in love
