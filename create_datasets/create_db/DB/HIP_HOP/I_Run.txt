I run the streets all night and day
(The hood love Thug)
'Cause I still run the streets all night and day
(If you're tryna find me)

I rep for my city, go hard for the hood
Still posted on their block, what's good?
And I run, the streets all night and day
I can't stay away

They don't make too many niggas like me
Bonafide hustler, certified G
Still got that work if you got the right fee
You thinkin' shit fake? Well, nigga, come see

It's bigger than the jewels, it's bigger than the cars
It's bigger than the fact that we fuckin' rap stars
The street niggas know me, these boys got my contacts
Knowin' any givin' minute I can come back

I put a bitch on I-10 and tell her run that
Give her 10 and tell her don't bring nuthin' back
I'm still in tha hood, I can't leave the streets
It's in my blood, I'm a Thug till I be deceased

I run the streets all night and day
(The hood love Thug)
'Cause I still run the streets all night and day
(If you're tryna find me)

I rep for my city, go hard for the hood
Still posted on their block, what's good?
And I run, the streets all night and day
I can't stay away

It's hot on my block, somebody turn the fan on
I've been paid, I'm just tryin' to turn my man's on
N get my brains strong, streets miss me when I'm gone
I put on for my city like Jeezy's song

Please believe me, Holmes, matter of fact, check my stats
Ain't dropped in 3 years but I'm back
Where the money at? That's the first question
You better pack a strap, that's the first lesson

Hard times got the whole United States stressin'
I'm writin' a book, how to survive in a recession
Mr. Oboma, we so tired of sellin' crack
If you lookin' for me, ask the streets where I'm at

I run the streets all night and day
(The hood love Thug)
'Cause I still run the streets all night and day
(If you're tryna find me)

I rep for my city, go hard for the hood
Still posted on their block, what's good?
And I run, the streets all night and day
I can't stay away

It's home sweet home where the D boys roam
Movin' stone for stone or zone for zone
All night gettin' it on till 6 in tha morn
Tha shit I'm smokin' on, stronger than cologne

You can probably smell the smoke threw your headphones
If you still broke better get your bread long
Call me on that burner 'cause them feds on my phone
And I'mma run the streets till I'm under my headstone

I run the streets all night and day
(The hood love Thug)
'Cause I still run the streets all night and day
(If you're tryna find me)

I rep for my city, go hard for the hood
Still posted on their block, what's good?
And I run, the streets all night and day
I can't stay away
