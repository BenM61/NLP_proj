I won't tell you what I'm thinking
'Cause it's not the same thing you're thinking too

You could say I got a best friend
And she's always tellin' me what to do

She's out of sight but easy to find
She's in the front of our minds

The little voice in my head
Won't let me forget
The little voice in my head
Is never misled
All of this noise is what
Keeps me from making a mess
The little voice in my head
Just won't let me get with you

La la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la

When I see you I admit
I start to lose my grip
And all of my cool
Ya' smell so sweet
Just like my perfume
What have you been doing since I left you

You're always there in my thoughts
But that doesn't mean that it's on

The little voice in my head
Won't let me forget
The little voice in my head
Is never misled
All of this noise is what
Keeps me from making a mess
The little voice in my head
Just won't let me get with you

I know I sound insane like I'm playin' games
'Cause all I really want is you
But there's some things a girl won't do

Oh oh!

The little voice, the little voice!

The little voice in my head
Won't let me forget
The little voice in my head
Is never misled
All of this noise is what
Keeps me from making a mess
The little voice in my head
Just won't let me get with you
