Dead dreams dropping off the heart
Like leaves in a dry season
Dead dreams dropping off the heart
Like leaves in a dry season

How long do I take it
Can I start to change it
You know it's been a long long time
Can I grow a new skin
Can I try to begin again

Dead dreams dropping off the heart
Like leaves in a dry season
Dead dreams dropping off the heart
Like leaves in a dry season

I am always waking
I am always shaking
I think I know this might not end

Can I dry the cold sweat
Get out of this mess again

Dead dreams dropping off the heart
Like leaves in a dry season
Dead dreams dropping off the heart
Like leaves in a dry season

Dead dreams dropping off the heart
Like leaves in a dry season
Dead dreams dropping off the heart
Like leaves in a dry season

Ease into a new box
Shoulder a new lot
It's gonna be a long long time
A whirlwind among breezes
Doing what he pleases again

Dead dreams dropping off the heart
Like leaves in a dry season
Dead dreams dropping off the heart
Like leaves in a dry season
