I heard your reason, why you're leavin', can't we talk it throu-ough
Yeah - I know I hurt ya, you hurt me too
It's crazy what people can do to each other
When emotio-ions, start fillin' up inside your hea-ead
It gets so complicated and he's so frustrated
You forget to say the things that ought to be said

My simple heart - my simple heart, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-eah
My simple heart will always love you-ou
My simple heart - my simple heart, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-eah
My simple heart will always love you

I'm not the school kid you fell in love with somewhere back in ti-ime
You might have grown up, it's time to own up
You've had your lovers and yes I've had mine
But I love ya, I still want ya, there's so much that I can give
If we were less demanding, a little more understanding 
Together we can find a better way to live

My simple heart - my simple heart, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-eah
My simple heart will always love you-ou

Got a simple, simple heart that truly loves you-ou
And though we may have our problems darling
We'll make it through, yes we will
And as well, this simple heart of mine will always love you
Don't ask me how I know, I simply do

My simple heart - my simple heart, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-eah
My simple heart will always love you
