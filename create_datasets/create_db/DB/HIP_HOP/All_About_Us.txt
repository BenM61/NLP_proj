Just swing it, from the front to the back to the side
 Till it makes you feel all right, said it's all about us tonight .....right. (x2)

 I want you all to myself
 Tonight girl, can't think of anyone else
 Our friends will just have to realize
 Tonight is for you and I

 My friends will have to understand that tonight is all about us
 But your friends can make some other plans 'cause' tonight is all about us

 This feeling must be the best in the world
 How can I just get closer to you girl
 I wonder what kind of day it would be
 If there were no you for me

 Now I've been all around the world
 but there's no place like being with you girl
 'cause' you make me smile

 My friends will have to understand that tonight is all about us
 But your friends can make some other plans 'cause' tonight is all about us (x2)

 Now I've been all around the world
 but there's no place like being with you girl
 'cause' you make me smile

 Yeah here I come
 What about your friends I don't want to couse no shit
 But if ya slippin' back messages then come garage equipped
 I'd flip ya twice just to find you're masculinityflex
 'cause' if we're sexen on a platter ain't no need to get wet
 I'd set it up around nine if you got the clock
 No entourage just you on the solo spot
 Who'll make it hot hot bumpin' in the back of your jeep
 It's Bo Peep so you'd just better creep with me
 You've been around the universe girls throwing your skirts
 Pancakes want to spread but the butter ain't worth
 Silky silky you're the only vibe for me
 You don't hevve to worry 'bout me tryin' to ride for free
 'cause' in return I'm a burn assets arise
 Naughty with the gridlock make your nature rise
 compromise with the caramel chocolate bite
 No company ''cause it's all about us tonight

 My friends will have to understand that tonight is all about us
 But your friends can make some other plans 'cause' tonight is all about us (rpt to fade)
