When first I came to Louisville, some pleasure there to find
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips, like arrows pierced my breast
The name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West.
(And the name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West)

I courted lovely Flora, some pleasure for to find
But she turned unto another man, which sore distressed my mind
She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me off my rest
Then go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
(Then go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West)

'Way down in yonder shady grove, a man of high degree
Conversing with my Flora there, which seemed so strange to me
And the answer that she gave to him, it sore did me oppress
I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West.
(I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West)

I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand
I seized him by the collar, and boldly made him stand
Being mad by desperation, I pierced him through the breast
All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
(All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West)

I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea
They placed me in the witness box, and then commenced on me
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.
(Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West)
