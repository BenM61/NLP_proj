Well who's that guy you've been seeing most everyday
He shouldn't be allowed to take my baby away
Baby why don't you wake up all we gotta do is make up
Come on baby don't break up with me

Well I saw you walking with him just the other night
I almost flipped when I saw him squeeze you tight
Baby why don't you wake up all we gotta do is make up
Come on baby don't break up with me

Don't you remember when the time you was so true
Then he came along and looked at you
Don't you remember when you said you love me so
Baby please don't go

Looka hear looka hear I know you wont be true
If you like him then I know he likes you
Baby why don't you wake up all we gotta do is make up
Come on baby don't break up with me

Don't you remember when the time you was so true
Then he came along and looked at you
Don't you remember when you said you love me so
Baby please don't go

Looka hear I know you wont be true
If you like him then I know he likes you
Baby why don't you wake up all we gotta do is make up
Come on baby don't break up with me
Come on baby don't break up with me
Come on baby don't break up with me
