Break down
Break down

Break down
I was scared to death I was losing my mind
Break down
I was scared to death I was losing my mind
Break down

I couldn't close my eyes I was pacing all night, oh, no,
I think I found the light at the end of the tunnel (and my doubts)
I couldn't find the truth I was going under

But I won't hide inside
I gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out
Lonely inside and light the fuse
Light it now, light it now, light it now

And now I will start living today, today, today
I close the door
I got this new beginning and I will fly
I'll fly like a cannonball, like a cannonball, like a cannonball
I'll fly, I'll fly, I'll fly like a cannonball

Freedom
I let go of fear and the peace came quickly
Freedom
I was in the dark and then it hit me
I chose suffering and in pain in the falling rain
I know, I gotta get out into the world again

But I won't hide inside
I gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out
Lonely inside and light the fuse
Light it now, light it now, light it now

And now I will start living today, today, today
I close the door
I got this new beginning and I will fly
I'll fly like a cannonball, like a cannonball, like a cannonball
I'll fly, I'll fly, I'll fly like a cannonball

Break down
I was scared to death I was losing my mind
Break down
I gotta get out into the world again

And now I will start living today, today, today
I close the door
I got this new beginning and I will fly
I'll fly like a cannonball, like a cannonball, like a cannonball
I'll fly, I'll fly, I'll fly like a cannonball, like a cannonball, like a cannonball
I'll fly, I'll fly, I'll fly like a cannonball
