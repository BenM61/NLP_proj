Boogie Woogie Baby

You've got my baby with the pretty pretty skirt
I know she's mine 'cause she's just one flirt
She's my boogie woogie baby
She's my boogie woogie baby

Boogie woogie baby
Boogie all the time
Yes she's kinda tall with a fine face
That pretty skirt with a tight tall waist

She's my boogie woogie baby
She's my boogie woogie baby
She's my boogie woogie baby
Boogie all the time

There's a pretty little doll
Five feet from the ground
But every time she pass'
My love is tumblin' down

She's my boogie woogie baby
She's my boogie woogie baby
She's my boogie woogie baby
Boogie all the time
