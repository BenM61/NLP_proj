City girls they're all right
They just want you for the night
But when the morning comes at dawn
City girls they all gone
You know the daylight can be sad
When you feel that you've been had
Only night time brings the price
City girl she thinks it's right

What's a poor boy going to do
If he wants a girl like you
Can't afford no diamond rings
Or all those other fancy things
Only one thing I can give
A song down where you live
I'll sing to you hear the sound
City girl please stay around
