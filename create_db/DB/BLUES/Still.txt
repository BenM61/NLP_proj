In my last years with him there were bruises on my face
In my dawn a new day
I finally got away
But my head's all messed up and he knows just what to say
No more dawn and new days
I'm goin back to stay
So why say bye bye
When it only makes me cry
I still
Light up like a candle burnin' when he calls me up
I still
Melt down like a candle burnin' every time we touch
Oh say what you will
He does me wrong and I should be gone
But I still
Be lovin' you baby and it's much too much

We are goin down
'Cause you're always getting high
And your crumbs of lovin'
No longer get me by
Wow! It get better every time that we get high
Then your crumbs of lovin'
They somehow get me by
Why, say bye bye
When it only makes me cry
I still
Light up like a candle burnin' when he calls me up
I still
Melt down like a candle burnin' every time we touch
I still
Light up like a candle burnin' when he calls me up
I still
Melt down like a candle burnin' every time we touch
Oh say what you will
He does me wrong and I should be gone
I be lovin' you baby and it's much too much

Can't I go my severed way?
Some rain for my sunny day
Not even one reason to stay
Why?
I should've left you
Why?
I can't forgetcha baby
Why?
Ever since I metcha it's
Why?
I still

I still
Light up like a candle burnin' when he calls me up
I still
Melt down like a candle burnin' every time we touch
I still
Light up like a candle burnin' when he calls me up
I still
Melt down like a candle burnin' every time we touch
I still
He does me wrong and I should be gone
I be lovin' you baby and it's much too much
