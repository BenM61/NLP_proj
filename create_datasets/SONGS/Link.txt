Do you remember? 
When we were kids, there was a door that we couldn't reach even standing on tiptoes
We've wandered about, and forgotten time
We always run into the labyrinth road here

I can't stop unconsciously looking for your smile
Nothing has changed, even now I run

Even if we're far away from each other, our thoughts are connected
Even if a mischevious fate tries to befall us, we won't break

If the tomorrow that I wish for is ahead of me
Everyone should notice this, in their minds
One day I want to show you when
The means for conflict disappear, in the clear days

People won't stop hurting one another in this degenerating world
But since meeting you, I have nothing to fear anymore

It doesn't matter how much my body burns up, as long as it's given to you
I'll soar up to to heaven in pure white, and watch over you

Even if we're far away from each other, our thoughts are connected
Even if a mischevious fate tries to befall us, we won't break

It doesn't matter how much my body burns up, as long as it's given to you
It would be nice if the world that I'm reborn in reaches your eyes, someday
