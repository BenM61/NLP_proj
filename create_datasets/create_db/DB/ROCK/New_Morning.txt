I don't give a dam about the castle on the hill
All the gold that we could eat, or the horse you had for sale
No I'm getting kinda rich on the side of any soul alive

I don't give a dam if I'm running from the law
When my moneys not enough and they come and take it all
No I'm getting kinda rich on the side of any soul alive

Have you heard the Mona Lisa
Have yo heard who you are
Your a new morning
Your a new morning

Wanna be ok when I'm sitting here alone not 
Just thinking of the ways that I could have done it wrong
No I'm getting kinda rich on the side of any soul alive

Have you heard the Mona Lisa
Have you heard who you are
Your a new morning
Your a new morning
Your a new morning

Now, your a new morning now
Have you heard my Mona Lisa
Have you heard who you are
Your a new morning
Your a new morning
Your a new morning

Now, your a new morning now
