If it is as you say and it's coming your way
Who will stop ya?
If it is what you do and it's all up to you
Don't watch your TV when you're broken up

These middle class kids are so strange
Get everything for nothing, nothing comes your way
Emotional, bored and self contained
Full of fronted self delusion but I guess that is the way to be a

Tabloid lover, one bed to another
Tabloid lover, splatters any other
Tabloid lover, rocks to box runner
Gotta get to cover, finally you discover
You are what you are

If this is what you do and it's all up to you
Who's gonna stop ya? Who's gonna block ya?
If you get it every day and it comes every way
All much emotion when I'm trying to dream but

Middle class kids are all the same
Get everything for nothing, nothing comes your way
Drugged up, bored and self contained
And I guess, I could just leave it but I've gotta find a way to kill a

Tabloid lover, splatters any other
Sad sec mother, one bed to another
Tabloid lover, rocks to box runner
Pound it, I've found I've got to get to cover

And who will stop you?
Don't watch the TV when you're dreaming
Who will stop ya?

Tabloid lover, one bed to another
Tabloid lover, splatters any other
Tabloid lover, she can't get another
Can't get another, can't get another

Well, tabloid lover, rocks to box runner
Tabloid lover, hey, street stunner
Tabloid lover, can't find another
Can't find another, you can't find another

Tabloid
Tabloid
