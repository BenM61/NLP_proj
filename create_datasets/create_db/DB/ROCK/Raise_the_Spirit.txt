Nothing gonna break heart your today
Nothing gonna steal your light away, no
Even when the skies are turning gray
Ah, you're gonna welcome in the rain, yeah

Come on, come on
Ah, let me hear it another time
Come on, come on
I?ll raise the spirit

Nothing gonna chain you once your free
Haven't gotta live in misery, no
Even when you tried out every key
But still another door worth opening, yeah

Come on, come on
Ah, let me hear it another time
Come on, come on
I?ll raise the spirit

Music in your heart, coming on in waves, love
But thunder in your head is rolling away

Nothing gonna twist your arm again
Nothing gonna sway you like the wind, no
Nothing gonna get under your skin
Nothing gonna twist your arm again, no

Come on, come on
Ah, let me hear it another time
Come on, come on
I?ll raise the spirit

Come on, come on
Ah, let me hear it another time
Come on, come on
I?ll raise the spirit
