Sometimes I'm complicated and sometimes I'm not
Sometimes all the evil in the world got me searching for an easy way out
Oh I know I can be kind of robotic
But I'm beating with blood, still thinking too much for it
You say I'm irrational but I'm just looking up

So come back to me sweet dreamer
You don't have to pay the rent
Just show me what we're working for
Say it time and time again
Show me the love that we had before
Without tearing the world apart

Sometimes I'm a regular, well sometimes I'm not
Got 6 deep into tarantulas so there's no going back anymore
Oh I don't see you that often anymore
Is there something I said? Something I did?
Oh, I'm so lost here in Avignon
And flat out of luck

So come back to me sweet dreamer
You don't have to pay the rent
Just show me what we're working for
Say it time and time again
Show me the life that we had before
Without tearing the world apart
If you show me what we're working for
Was it me again?
Show me the trust that we had before
Without tearing the world apart

Come back to me, come back to me, come back to me
(Sweet dreamer) Come back to me
Come back to me, come back to me, come back to me
(Sweet dreamer) Come back to me

Just show me what we're working for
Was it something I said? Something I did?
Show me the love that we had before
Without tearing the world apart
Just show me what we're working for
Was it me again?
Show me the trust that we had before
Without tearing the world apart

(Sweet dreamer)
