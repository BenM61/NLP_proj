I should get out of this seat 
Feel the world beneath my feet 
Strive to see more of the sun 
Try to change what I've become 

Move on up through this down 
Take this luck and turn it around 

I get near you but I never seem to reach you 
Somewhere tonight the stars still shine 
Somehow I've got to re-align 
Fueled by the promise of the sun 
Pulled by the charm this night has spun 

Move on up through this down 
Take this luck and turn it around 

I get near you but I never seem to reach you
