How many times did you think you would let him
Slip through your fingers now you can not forget him
(Another day comes and another day goes)
(Another day comes and another day goes)
You go to the corner shop for cigarettes and matches
The streets are cold and wet, the grasses grows in patches
(Another day comes and another day goes)
(Another day comes and another day goes)
There's a deep deep river leading out to the sea
There's never a day goes by when I don't shed a tear for you
I build a bridge but that river's too wide
I don't know if love is waiting on the other side
(Another day comes and another day goes)
(Another day comes and another day goes)
I drive for hours in the pouring rain
No direction but have to want to let you know
Outside the trees are bent and shaking with the cold
The hands that held you then are now refusing to be told
There's a deep deep river leading out to the sea
There's never a day goes by when I don't shed a tear for you
I build a bridge but that river's too wide
I don't know if love is waiting on the other side
(Another day comes and another day goes)
(Another day comes and another day goes)
Another day comes (and another day goes)
(Another day comes and another day goes)
(Another day comes and another day goes)
Another and another and another and another and another and another and another and another day(another day comes and another day goes)
(Another day comes and another day goes)
There's a deep deep river leading out to the sea
