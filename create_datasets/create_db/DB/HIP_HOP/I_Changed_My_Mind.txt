You know who you are
Yea you

Kanye West on the track by the way

Yea,
No, No

There's this girl I know
So deep in love (in love)
Do almost anything
To make him see she's the one
But he doesn't feel a girl like her
He's so, so wrapped up
Cause the average girl
Will give him anything that he wants

He's so caught up
He won't call her
He shows no love
So she decides

I changed my mind
I don't love you
I don't love you no more
Don't waste my time
I don't love you
I don't love you no more

It's the funniest thing cause I
Know how I feel inside
But you never felt the same as I
(never, never, never, oh)
I miss him so much
I bet you he don't even notice
And he don't even realize
Cause he

He's so caught up
He won't call her
He shows no love
So she decides

I changed my mind
I don't love you
I don't love you no more
Don't waste my time
I don't love you
I don't love you no more

I'm so over you
I got no more to give
I gave it all to you
And you couldn't handle it
And I don't care
If you come back to me on your knees
I just don't love you no more

I changed my mind
I don't love you
I don't love you no more
Don't waste my time
I don't love you
I don't love you no more

Stop

What you thinkin'
When you see me on the corner
And you see me hagin' out
Niggas on the block
Don't care what it's all about

And stop

What you thinkin'
When you see me comin through
And you see me with a nigga
On the corner til' 2
