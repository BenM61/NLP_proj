Cold days of winter have come & gone 
Wonder what summer will bring 
Maybe a new love to carry me on 
But first got to get through the spring 
I don't know why but all the rivers 
They've gone & run dry First off, and 
The last to go home There's a rustling 
Behind me turn. I should have known 

There's nothing there to see I find myself 
Searching for the real thing and I don't 
Know how I'll be hurting you this time 
Came here a long time ago 
Been around since I don't know when 
Stuck it out even though 
I knew I didn't fit in but I feel so helplessly alone 
I feel so alone I feel so alone now I feel so alone now
