I want to annoy
And I'm going to enjoy it
And merely 'cause we're bored
Merely because we're bored.

'Cause all you do is hope
You're all fucking hopers
And it's the Lord of the Flies all over again
It's the Lord of the Flies all over again

Now who holds the shell will be Caesar
You can even have it written on your t-shirt
Now who holds the shell will be Caesar
You can even have it written on your t-shirt (Here we go)

King of the hopers will fall
We're gonna knock down the walls
Singin' the Caesar will fall
We gonna knock down his doors

I've heard it all before
And I chose to ignore it
There's someone at your door
There's somebody at your door

Prepare for the test
We'll all get infested
Now it's the Milgram device all over again
It's the Milgram device all over again

Now who holds the shell will be Caesar
You can even have it written on your t-shirt
Now who holds the shell will be Caesar
You can even have it written on your t-shirt (Here we go)

King of the hopers will fall
We're gonna knock down the walls
Singin' the Caesar will fall (We gonna knock down his doors)
We gonna knock down his doors

Hey, Caesar
Yo, Coco
'Ello, geezer
Hey, momma
Can you fly?
Yup
I've heard robins can fly
Whatever
Huh?

We're gonna knock down the walls

King of the hopers will fall
We're gonna knock down the walls
Singin' the Caesar will fall
We're gonna knock down the walls, knock down the walls

King of the hopers will fall (We're gonna knock down the walls)
Singin' the Caesar will fall (Knock down the walls)

I'm going to enjoy it
