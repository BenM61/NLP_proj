Time heals the wounded, but my heart still
Bleeds.
I can't get you out of my life.  Here is my
Confession: you're all I need; I don't want to
Love you, but, oh, oh, oh,
With the touch of your hand, I come undone.
With the flash of your burning eyes I know
That you're the only one.  I come... I come
Undone.  I come undone.
Your footsteps are heartbeats.  There's
Knocking on my door.
I swore that I won't let you in.
Love's got its heroes, but I know that I just
Can't hold out forever, and, oh, oh, oh, 
With the touch of your hand, I come undone.
With the flash of your burning eyes I know
That you're the only one.  I come... I come
Undone.  I come undone.
Don't know what you're doing to me, 'cause
When your arms reach out I'm gone.

Here is my confession: 
You're all I need; I don't want to
Love you, but, oh, oh, oh,
With the touch of your hand, I come undone.
With the flash of your burning eyes I know
That you're the only one.  I come... I come
Undone.  I come undone.
