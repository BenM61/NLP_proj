He said
I am the worldly wise
Just look into my eyes
And wish for anything

And so she held his gaze
And fell into his maze
And saw that world around
Was just a wall of sound

I bet it's all around
See it trough his eyes
I can touch the wall of sound
And feel
I bet it's all around
See it trough his eyes
I can touch the wall of sound
And feel...awake

She felt the warms descent
Her life was start to end
A magic energy

No longer half alive
Emerged and mesmerized
The perfect vision found
Inside the wall of sound

I bet it's all around
See it trough his eyes
I can touch the wall of sound
And feel
I bet it's all around
See it trough his eyes
I can touch the wall of sound
And feel... awake
