C-O-double M-O-N
A wave, an awesome wave,
That rushes skin and widens in blooded veins.
Breathe in, exhale,
I’ve poked a nerve he’ll slap me like a whale
Slaps the C-O-double M-O-N.

Tide out, tide in,
A flood of blood to the heart and the fear slipstreams.
Breathe in, exhale,
I’ve poked a nerve he’ll slap me like a whale
Slaps the C-O-double M-O-N.
Flood of blood to the heart.
Flood flood flood of blood blood blood to the heart heart heart, to the heart, heart, heart.
