E-40 -one night stand

Let's go baby girl let's go
Let's get the mother fucking flow baby girl let's go
Everybody in the club on the floor for sure
Let's get some mother fucking slap on that's for sure 
Let's go baby girl let's go
Let's get the mother fucking flow baby girl let's go
All my nigas in the club on the floor for sure
Let's get some mother fucking slap on that's for sure 

Never running outta lingo
40 water right back at em with another single
Money longer than the neck on a flamingo
20,000 dollar bet in the casino
I got a partner on parole that just got out of chino
Not a rookie but a vet like dan marino
My favorite actor on the set al pacino
This is a heater man, hot like jalepeno
Follow the leader
40 from califoolya you hearing in your speaker
My life ain't no cartoon it's not animated like seta
Hot like a hot air balloonist I'm just an opportunist
The sooner the better you let me know that we can do this

(Chorus)
Excuse me lady I been lookin at you from over here 
And I was wondering if I could buy you a beer
And maybe later we can cud,
I don't want to be your man 
I don't want to be the one let's have a one night stand
I know I don't know you and stuff 
But maybe we could get to know each other 
Over a couple of glasses of whatever's in this cup
I don't wanna go and dance
I don't wanna be the one let's have a one night stand

Let's get it cracking like some broken bones ,money mackin'
Talkin on them burnout phones, cadillacin'
Wood grain dash, and doors and floor mats
Good game cash, I stash the store raps
PS2 clarity, diamond watches and super bam botches
Eclair and cotches and choppers fresh out the boxes
I like to polish my rims and tires
Hundred spokes wide
With armoral baby wipes cause my baby drink wine
Nothing but the best on the flesh, just like sex
Rubbin lotion all on her gluteus maximus
I don't see no ring all I see is miss 60 jeans
Walking through the club like she ready to do some things
Full of that turtle, got 40 smelling like skunk
But everybody knows you can't smell yourself when your drunk
Posted at the bar I'm a star I get a bar
2-way me you're number I'll give a player a card

Chorus

This is for my fuckers who lets in all my guys
There's a new rapper in town E40's on the rise
Known for having sic wit it records and jive ties
Business men always at work like barry white
The guy with all the slang in the game about the yey
Gorillaz , marine world africa USA
You feel us, it's sick out here in the bay where we stay
You kill us, I wish that somebody would come and pray
Live life like there ain't no tomorrow, ain't no tomorrow
Life is something that you can't borrow, that you can't borrow
Everyday's a holiday
Everyday may we celebrate
Everyday we modulate
Everyday may we perculate

Chorus

Let's go baby girl let's go
Let's get the mother fucking flow baby girl let's go
Everybody in the club on the floor for sure
Let's get some mother fucking slap on that's for sure 
Let's go baby girl let's go
Let's get the mother fucking flow baby girl let's go
All my nigas in the club on the floor for sure
Let's get some mother fucking slap on that's for sure
