I'll be seeing you tomorrow
I'll be seeing you again
God knows we've said so little
I'd go so far as to call you a friend

But there's something in your ways
That keeps me vying for a connection
And I know you feel the same
It's become a two-way addiction

Come on and give me your heart
Write it on the back of my hand
And say it's forever

Well we never really said goodbye
Kinda left it in the air
And as the train pulled off I knew you loved her more

Oh no no no no
I'm not afraid to lose
Oh no no no no
Just give me some time and I'll walk to a different groove

Go on and give her your heart
Write it on the back of her hand
And say it's forever

Go on and give her your heart
Write it on the back of her hand
And say it's forever

That's alright, that's ok, the thoughts of you are leaving
That's alright, that's ok, the thoughts of you are leaving
Anyway, are fading anyway

Come on and give her your heart
Write it on the back of her hand
And say it's forever

Come on and give me your heart
Come on and give me your heart
Come on and give me your heart
