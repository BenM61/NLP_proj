Don't want a picture 
To pin upon my wall 
Just want someone to 
Help me forget that's all 

I don't want to be here on my own 
Hungry as a dog without a bone 

Don't want a postcard 
Showing some distant view 
Just want someone to 
Laugh when I blow a fuse 

I don't want to be here on my own 
Hungry as a dog without a bone 

And I don't want to be alone 
I don't want to cry and moan 

Yeah and I don't want to be alone 
I don't want to cry and moan...I 

Nobody can hear a single word I say 

As I walk the floor 
Seems there's nothing more 
Time to go to sleep once more 

But in my dreams there's a place 
Where it's never too late 
I see nothing has changed 
And that's where you still remain 

(Don't want a picture, don't want a postcard)
