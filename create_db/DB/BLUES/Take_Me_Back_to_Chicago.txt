Take me back to Chicago
Lay my soul to rest
Where my life was free and easy
Remember me at my best

Take me back to Chicago
Where music was all I had
I tried to be good as I could
And sometimes that made me sad

Take me back to Chicago, to Chicago
Why don't you take me back
Take me back, take me back
To Chicago

I still dream of the Lake of peacefulness
The warm summer breeze
Cause my life was so much simpler then
Street corners and Tastee Freeze

Take me back to Chicago
Cause hustlin's not my style
L.A. was just a bit too hard
I wish I could be a child 

Livin' back in Chicago, in Chicago
Why don't you take me back
Take me back, take me back
To Chicago

Take me back to Chicago
Lay my soul to rest
Where my life was free and easy
Remember me at my best

Take me back to Chicago
Cause hustlin's not my style
L.A. was just a bit too hard
I wish I could be a child

Livin' back in Chicago, in Chicago
Why don't you take me back
Take me back, take me back
To Chicago

Take me back, take me back
