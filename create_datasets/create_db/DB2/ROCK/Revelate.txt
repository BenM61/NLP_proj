My simple slant
My broken chant
My human fate
My revelate
Are you so far from me this day
That you can't say my revelate

My open arms
My lucky charm
Number eight 
My revelate
I fucked it up
I rest my case
This is all too grey
My revelate

Sometimes I need a revelation
Cause sometimes it's all too hard to take
Sometimes I need a revelation
This time I'm making my own now

Does this mean we're though
Does this mean it's gone
I spent a day just to ponder the words
That I would write to you this day
But all it's too great 
My revelate

Sometimes I need a revelation
Sometimes its all too hard to take
Sometimes I need a revelation
This time it's up in arms

This time I need ya revelation
Sometimes it's all too much to take
This time I need a revelation
Sometimes it's easy just to hate ya
Sometimes I need a revelation
Sometimes I, sometimes I,

Redeem yourself
Redeem yourself
Redeem yourself
