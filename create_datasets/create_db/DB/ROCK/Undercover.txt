Caught up in the undertow
Takes me from what I never had
Back to what I'll know

Down, hold me, drag me down, hold me

Now I'm left undercover
Only half way there
Man you left me undercover
A gypsy out of nowhere
Undiscovered, I was left for dead
Man you left me undercover

Sleep does not rest easy in this place
The urgency of water only knows how to take

Down, hold me, drag me down, hold me

Now I'm left undercover
Only half way there
Man you left me undercover
A gypsy out of nowhere
Undiscovered, I was left for dead
Man you left me undercover
Doo doo, doo doo, ooh ooh

Now I'm left undercover
Only half way there
Man you left me undercover
A gypsy out of nowhere
Undiscovered, I was left for dead
Man you left me undercover
