In the midnight haze
We are sitting in the sun
The light hits your face
And I know that you're the one
We could fill the pages
With good dreams tonight
I wanna be a chapter in your book of love

In your boo ooh book of love
In your boo ooh book of love
In your boo ooh
In your boo ooh
In your boo ooh book of love

Maybe we are flying too close to the sun
And we may get burnt, but It'd be a crime to run
'Cause you're perfect as the deep blue sky above
You can be a chapter in my book of love

In my boo ooh book of love
In my boo ooh book of love
In my boo ooh
In my boo ooh
In my boo ooh book of love

Eternity is our playground
Tell me if you wanna get high
Tell me if you wanna be down

In my boo ooh book of love
In my boo ooh book of love
In my boo ooh
In my boo ooh
In my boo ooh book of love

In my
In my
In my
Book of love
