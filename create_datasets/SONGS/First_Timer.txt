Please operator, please operator, This is the first time I'm with a woman
Well years can change, And we become much older 
Oh but we don't always realize, And it becomes harder and harder 
Soon I'll be too old to be a debutante, I'm hangin' up my telephone

How come you don't ever come, How come you don't ever come
I'm hangin' up my telephone, How come you don't ever come
Tonight will be the first time ever, That I'll fall in love with the things we can do
Tonight will be the first time ever, That I'll get to know the things we can do

We'll take a break, our line's engaged, No one can stop me now
Well comin' in, it thrills me so, Never ever let me go, never let me go
Go go go, Year can change and we get older and older
Soon I'll be too old to be a debutante, And it becomes harder and harder

Don't leave me hangin' on the telephone, Please don't leave me hangin' on my telephone
How come you don't ever come, How come you don't ever come
Oh yeah, Please operator, please operator, Look out
