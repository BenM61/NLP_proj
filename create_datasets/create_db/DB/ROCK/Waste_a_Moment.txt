I'm not asking for much.
I'm not asking for anything.

I'm alone, a self, anemic and sometimes I wake up.
If I get hold of this hope inside my head we'd understand and let us down.

I'm not asking for much.
I'm not asking for anything.
(I) I won't waste a moment.
(I) I won't waste a moment with you.

We're alone and self - anemic and sometimes we wake.

I'm not asking for much.
I'm not asking for anything.
(I) I won't waste a moment.
(I) I won't waste a moment.

I can run, I can run, I can run, I can run.
Let me go, I can run, I can run, I can run.
Let me go, I can run, I can run, I can run.
Let me go, I can run, I can run, I can run.

Just cover up your eyes so I can make sense of it all. 
You're waking me up.
Shut your eyes so I can make sense of it all. 
I can make sense of it all.
So I can make sense of it all.
