Black night baby
Past the midnight hour, yeah
All around me, all around me, all around me
Butterfly women singing

No time for trouble
A time of joy
I'm far from home
Don't care no more

Fallin' down 
The Bangkok rain keeps fallin' down 
Bangkok rain keeps on fallin' down 
Bangkok rain keeps on fallin' down
I love that sound

Sittin' in a bar in Bangkok
Waitin' for the rain to stop
All around me, the butterfly women talkin'
Just talkin' and singing

No time for trouble
A time for joy now
I don't care no more
I don't care no more

Fallin' down 
The Bangkok rain keeps fallin' down 
Bangkok rain keeps on fallin' down 
Bangkok rain keeps on fallin' down
Down on the ground, yeah, ow

No time for trouble
It's a time for joy
I don't care no more
I'm too far from home

Fallin' down 
Bangkok rain keeps on fallin' down 
Bangkok rain keeps on fallin' down 
Bangkok rain keeps on fallin' down
Down on the ground, yeah

I'm a free spirit
A travelling man
Round the world I like to lurk
The rain comes down
In a Bangkok town
My heart is in my mouth
Baby, won't you please take me home?
I ain't got nowhere to go
No trouble 
Freaky city

Freaky city
Freak city
Freak city

Freak city
Freak city
Freaky city
