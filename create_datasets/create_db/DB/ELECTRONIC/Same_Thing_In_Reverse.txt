How does it feel, what do you do,
When he's all alone with you?
Do you kiss him, hold his hand?
Who's the woman?  Who's the man?

Is it twisted, it is sick?
Mother nature's little trick.
I don't have to feel no shame;
In God's image I am made.

Your brother doesn't understand
How you could love another man.
Your poor father thinks we're cursed.
It's the same thing in reverse.

It's the same thing in reverse.
Nothing better, nothing worse.
It's the same thing in reverse.
It's the same thing, it's the same thing.

Love is!  La de dah.
What can you say?  Where do you go?
Do you want the world to know?
Make a prison of your fear.
Be a kamikaze queer.

Bite my lip, hold my tongue.
Hope I'm not the only one.
I don't have to be afraid;
In God's image I am made.

Your brother doesn't understand
How you could love another man.
And your poor father thinks we're cursed.
It's the same thing in reverse.

It's the same thing in reverse.
Nothing better, nothing worse.
It's the same thing in reverse.
It's the same thing, it's the same thing.

Do I love him?  Yes I love him.
So don't question my affection.
This is not some damn affliction.
It's just love, in contradiction.

It's the same thing, it's the same thing.
Black boys in cars. (It's the same thing.)
White boys with poisonous hearts. (It's the same thing.)
Even on the one-eyed guru. (It's the same thing.)
And why the hell you looking at me? (It's the same thing.)

I never wanted to be part of the gang. (It's the same thing.)
I never saw this as part of my plan. (It's the same thing.)
I walk down the street with pride. (It's the same thing.)
Happy that you're by my side.
