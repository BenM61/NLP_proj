I stepped off the plane
It was so fresh
I was at the club
It was so fresh

Sometimes things just have a way of making themselves clear
But most times I don't even care 'cause my week beats your year

I went to the show
It was so fresh
That drum at the bar
It was so fresh

Sometimes your eyes have a way it makes you drumming
Most times I don't even care because my week beats your year

I was at the party
And it was so fresh
I was looking so dope
And it was so fresh

Sometimes things just have a way of making themselves clear
But most times I don't even care because my week beats your year
