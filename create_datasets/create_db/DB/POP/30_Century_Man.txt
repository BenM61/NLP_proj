See the dwarfs an' see the giants
Which one would you choose to be

And if you can't get that together
Here's the answer, here's the key

You can freeze like thirty century man
Like a thirty century man

I'll save my breath and take it with me
Till a hundred years and so 
Shame you won't be there to see me
Shaking hands with Charles de Gaulle

Play it cool an' Saran wrap all you can
Like a thirty century man
You can freeze like a thirty century man
Like a thirty century man
