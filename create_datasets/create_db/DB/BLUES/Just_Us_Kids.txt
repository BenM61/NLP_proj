I've had enough of this small town bullshit
I'm not stayin' in school
I'm makin' good dough workin' with my brother
Cleanin' out pools
I'm going out to California
And man it won't be long
As soon as I get my license
Color me gone

Oh knock it off Johnny
Man, your livin' in your head
You ain't even got a car
And those chicks don't believe a word ya said
But you're doin' all the talkin'
So I just keep quiet
And this'll probably go no where
But I can't blame ya for tryin'

It's just us kids hangin' round the park at night
Hangin' round 'neath the vapor light
We got no drugs and we got no guns
Not even botherin' anyone

I don't have to wear a necktie
I don't have to punch a clock
I started up a dot com company
And man it rocks
Won't you come with me down to Mexico
In the winter with some friends?
My divorce will be final
Along about then
Meanwhile I got a gram and a real good ride
And don't you know I hurt way down inside?

Just us kids in the parking lot
Out here givin' it all we got
We don't want to get old and die
And there ain't nothing we wouldn't try

Ya know we could really have it all
Our kid's gonna graduate next fall
I could take retirement in 10 years
It's a damn short movie
How'd we ever get here?

[Repeat x2]
Just us kids hangin' out today
Watchin' our long hair turnin' gray
Not so skinny maybe not so free
Not so many as we used to be

[Repeat x3]
Not so skinny maybe not so free
Not so many as we used to be
