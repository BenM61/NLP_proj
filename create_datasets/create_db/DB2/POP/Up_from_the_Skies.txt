Tell me everything

I just want to talk to you
I won't do you no harm
I just want to know about your different lives
On this is here people farm
I heard some of you got your families
Living in cages tall and cold
And some just sit there and dust away
Past the age of old.
Is this true?
Please let me talk to you.

I just want to know
The rooms behind your minds
Uh do I see a vacuum there
Or am I going blind?
Or is it just remains of vibrations
And they happen long ago?
Things like "Love the world" and
"Let your fancy flow"
Is this true?
Please let me talk to you
Is this true?
I just want to talk to you.

I have lived here before
The days of ice
So of course this is why
I'm so concerned about the earth
'Cause I come back to find
The stars are misplaced
And the smell of a world
That's burned
A smell of a world
That's burned.

So where do I purchase my ticket?
I'd just like to have a ringside seat
I want to hear about these new Mother Earth
I want to hear and see everything
I want to hear and see everything
I want to hear and see everything

I want you to show me
I want you to say to me
Show me everything
Oh yeah is that true?
Is that true?
Please let me talk to you
Oh my new Mother Earth
I won't do you no harm
Yes I have lived here before,
Many times many times
I know you.
