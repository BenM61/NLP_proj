I'm icey, I got a tick from my head to my feet, that's Nike
And that's pricey
You see them guys over there they ain't like me
I got a Portuguese ting not wifey
She said my temper's tiny
I got two different worlds like Miley
You hit me up that's unlikely
But I walked in the room with a fresh trim
Showing my Colgate teeth
Yeah they're looking at me
Saying "can I get a pic for the 'Gram, just like AJ T"
No wonder they hate on me
'Cause I'm making P's and they see these clothes
Yeah I get 'em for free

Many guys, many many many guys
Hate me and it's, true too bad
I just stunt on you, too bad I don't look like you
Like many many many guys
Hate me and it's, true too bad
I just stunt on you, like too bad
