I dreamed of you on my farm
I dreamed of you in my arms
But dreams are always wrong
I never dreamed I'd hurt you
I never dreamed I'd lose you
In my dreams, I'm always strong
And now the creek is rising
And all my bridges burnt

I always dreamed of big crowds
Plooms of smoke and high clouds
But dreams don't last for long
I have my suspicions
When the stars are in position
All will be revealed

But I know that until then
Unless the stars surrender
All will be concealed
And now the snow is falling
And all my fences torn

I know you need someone
And I can hear someone
Somewhere in this song
I dreamed that I was walking
And the two of us were talking
Of all life's mysteries
But words that flow between friends
Winding streams, without end
I wanted you to see

But it can seem surprising
When you find yourself alone
And now the dark is rising
And a brand new moon is born
I always dreamed I'd love you
I never dreamed I'd lose you
In my dreams, I'm always strong
