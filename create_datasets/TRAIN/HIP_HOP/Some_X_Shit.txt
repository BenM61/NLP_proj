Verse 1: 
If I thought ya'll niggas really wanted drama 
I'd been took out the armor  word to my mama  I'm a 
Hit you niggas with something that you ain't never felt!! 
Hit you niggas for fronting you caught up in that hell!! 
If I thought that half the shit that bitches said was true 
I'd be spitting led at you, and dead your crew 
But if you know a bitch, you don't listen to that bitch!! 
You don't argue with that bitch, all you do is f*ck that bitch!! 
If I listened to all them fake niggas that's running they mouth 
I wouldn't be in the clear, I'd be loading up to run in your house 
You can't f*ck the coward, but the coward will be a coward!! 
And I'm done killing these cowards, and enough milling these cowards!! 
If I let the niggas around my way tell me how to feel about me 
I guess I really wouldn't be D 
But I'm the best that ever did it, the best at it cause I live it!! 
How many niggas eat it and shit it, you cats want it come and get it!!

Verse 2: 
It's not like me to have my back turned to open places 
I want to see it when it's coming so I can open faces 
I'm hoping cases got me paying to stay out of jail!! 
Run these streets got me to preying to stay out of hell!! 
Slipped, and I fell, got back up and slipped again 
But no matter what it's been niggas never gotta win 
It's a thin line I walk everyday when I'm good with it!! 
Projects nigga all my life but wouldn't say the hood did it!! 
Knew what I was doing, everyday that I been doing it 
Seeing niggas having a good time, so I'ma ruin it 
F*ck You, and F*ck your man, both them niggas is puss!! 
Fronting like you out the jungle but ain't never seen a bush!! 
When push comes to shove, whatever love we had take it with you 
Now peep what I just said and see how long it takes to hit you 
Everybody knows you can talk all day!! 
But when it's on what you gonna do walk away!?!?

Dismantle whatever's coming, ya'll niggas sit there when I'm hood!! 
How my niggas feeling? Good!!

What my niggas want? Blood!! 
You stay calling niggas bluff 
But if it's got to be, then it's gonna be, come on let's see!! 
Whatever my niggas want from me, is what my niggas gonna get from me!! 
And if I ever let the words of another nigga bother me
