It takes a whole lotta lovin' 
Just to keep my baby happy
It takes a whole lotta kissin' 
And a whole lotta holdin' her hand
It takes a whole lotta lovin' 
Just to keep my baby happy
'Cause she's a whole lotta woman
And she's gotta have a whole lotta man

Well when she loves me
She loves me so hard
She almost make-a me mad 
And when she kiss me
Well she don't kiss me
I know I've been had

It takes a whole lotta lovin' 
Just to keep my baby happy
It takes a whole lotta kissin' 
And a whole lotta holdin' her hand
It takes a whole lotta lovin' 
Just to keep my baby happy
Cause she's a whole lotta woman
And she's gotta have a whole lotta man
