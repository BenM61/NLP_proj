Come on, come on, come on, come on take that and party 
Come on, come on, come on, take that

Every part of you makes me feel that I've gotta touch you you know 
If only you knew what's in my mind 
I can't believe this girl 

Come on, come on, come on, come on take that and party 
Come on, come on, come on, take that

Don't catch the fall when I play real hard 
You'll never stop all my games 
If you only knew what's in my mind 
I can't believe this world 

Come on, come on, come on, come on take that and party 
Come on, come on, come on, take that
Come on, come on, come on, come on take that and party 
Come on, come on, come on, take that
