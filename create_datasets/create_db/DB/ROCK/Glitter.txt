When we make love 
It's hard to tell 
If your dreamin' of me 
Or someone else 
That drunken kiss 
Seems like a lie 
Don't say it's forever 
And then say goodbye 

Glitter 
Don't ya leave me 
Please believe me 
I only want your love 
Glitter you're my lover 
I'll have no other girl 
I only need your love 

When mornin' comes and the 
Sun shines bright 
You gonna need someone 
Someone to treat ya right 
So don't walk out 
When you wake up 
Let's give it a chance girl 
Let's give it a shot 
Give it a shot now 

Glitter, don't deceive me 
Gotta believe me 
Only need your love 
Glitter, there's no other 
You're beautiful 
I only want you 

This is fine for now, but 
Maybe, let's make a baby 
Inside of you 
It's just the time, 
We gotta find, 
I want your name 
On my tattoo 
You blow my mind, 
So tell me, 
I want to know 

Glitter shines forever 
Forever an' ever, 
I only need your love 
Glitter, lay your head down here 
I'll always be so near 
I only want your love 

Here comes the 
Here it comes 
There goes the 
There it goes 
Here comes our love again 
Through the window out 
I only want your love 

There goes the 
There it goes 
Here comes the 
Here it comes 
There goes our love again 
Out the window
