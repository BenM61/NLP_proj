There's lots of smoke around
The sound of war machines
I feel so scared, I just can't stand it
I feel like crying

You can't confer babe
Sometimes it hard to believe
It's for real, you're just the one I need
I wanna hear you

And when you scream in my ears
I know that you'll come back to me, dear

Turn it up, turn it up, I hear your voice, babe
Turn it up, turn it up, I get it so clear
Your voice is getting through my love
Your voice is turning up my love, my love, my love

Your face is in my dreams
The walls are made of steel
I feel so cold, I'm gonna score tonight
I feel like howling

Vibrations in my room
No matter where you are
Tonight I wanna be with you
I wanna hear you

And when you scream in my ears
I know that you'll come, yeah

Turn it up, turn it up, I hear your voice, babe
Turn it up, turn it up, I get it so clear
Your voice is getting through my love
Your voice is turning up my love, my love, my love

Your voice, your voice, turn it up
Your voice, your voice, turn it up

There's lots of smoke around
The sound of war machines
I feel so scared, I just can't stand it
I feel like crying

And when you scream in my ears
I know that you'll come back to me, dear

Turn it up, turn it up, I hear your voice, babe
Turn it up, turn it up, I get it so clear
Your voice is getting through my love
Your voice is turning up my love

Turn it up, turn it up, I hear your voice, babe
Turn it up, turn it up, I get it so clear
Your voice is getting through my love
Your voice is turning up my love

Turn it up, turn it up, I hear your voice, babe
Turn it up, turn it up, I get it so clear
Your voice is getting through my love
Your voice is turning up my love
