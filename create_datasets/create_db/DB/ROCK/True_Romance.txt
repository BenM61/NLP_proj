Open your eyes and see me,
Tell me that it's not too late.
Whisper to me a sad song,
Weighing us down in shame.

I always said I believed you,
You told me that was so cliche.
And with every kiss I resented you
Because your feelings never got in the way

I know that you never loved me;
I know that you never cared at all,
Maybe just one more dance
Cause that's as close as you're gettin' to a true romance

Open your heart and feel me,
Tell me you don't feel the same.
I dig down deep for forgiveness,
And still you're busy placing the blame.

This isn't about right or wrong now,
It's not about wasted time.
I should have paid closer attention,
But I didn't bother reading the signs.

I know that you never loved me;
I know that you never cared at all,
Maybe just one more dance
Cause that's as close as you're gettin' to a true romance
I know that you never loved me;
I know that you never cared at all,
No my love we can't be friends,
In face I liked you much better
When you'd just pretend.

I know that you never loved me;
I know that you never cared at all,
Maybe just one more dance
Cause that's as close as you're gettin' to a true romance

Open your arms and hold me,
Tell me it'll be alright.
Tell me the thing you've never told a soul
That keeps you up at night.

When could you tell it was over?
When did you turn on me?
I'd cry if I thought it would change your mind
Cry for the girl I hoped you to be.

I know that you never loved me;
I know that you never cared at all,
Maybe just one more dance
Cause that's as close as you're gettin' to a true romance

I know that you never loved me;
I know that you never cared at all,
Maybe just one more dance
Cause that's as close as you're gettin' to a true romance
