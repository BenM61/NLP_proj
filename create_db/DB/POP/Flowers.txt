I want to buy you flowers
It's such a shame you're a boy
But when you are not a girl
Nobody buys you flowers

I want to buy you flowers
And now I'm standing in the shop
I must confess I wonder
If you will like my flowers

You are so sweet and I'm so alone
Oh darling please
Tell me you're the one
I'll buy you flowers
I'll buy you flowers
Like no other girl did before

You were so sweet and I was in love
Oh darling don't tell me
You found another girl
Forget the flowers
Because the flowers
Never last for ever
Never last for ever
Never last for ever
My love
