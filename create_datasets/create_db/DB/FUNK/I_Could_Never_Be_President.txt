If I became President
I know I won't last a day
I would lower all the taxes
Just to suit your taste

I'd bring home all the fellers
From over in Vietnam
Station them around your door
So the world can't do you no harm

I'd name every street in the city
Honey, after you
In the fight against poverty
There's no limit to what I'd do

I could never be President
Just as long as I'm lovin' you
I could never be President
Just as long as I'm lovin' you, you, yeah

Honey I would make you
The first lady of the land
Don't you know, I'd place Presidential
Powers in your hand

Congress would veto the first bill
I would pass
First would be, ?Tear the White House down
Build you a house of glass?

And stake out the Navy
On every downtown street
So your little feet won't get so tired
When you go on a shopping spree

I could never be President
Just as long as I'm lovin' you
I could never be President
Just as long as I'm lovin' you, you, auh, auh

I could never be President
I could never be President

Honey to make sure
You never, never have a care
I'd open up the door to Fort Knox
Tell you to help yourself

And give you a nation
If that didn't seem to do
I'd send up a Gemini player
To stake a claim on the moon for you

I could never be President
Just as long as I'm lovin' you
I could never be President
Just as long as I'm lovin' you

I'd give you a nation
If that didn't seem to do
I could never be your President
Just as long as I'm lovin' you

No baby
Just as long as I'm lovin' you, auh
