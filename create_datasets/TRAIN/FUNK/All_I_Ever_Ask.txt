Love means so many different things
But you're all that matters
And this is all I'll ever ask of you

Tell me your dreams so they can be mine too
Let me be there to help them come true
Tell me your fears when you feel afraid
Come to my arms, let me rock them away

That's all I'll ever ask
That's all I'll ever ask
That's all I'll ever ask
That's all I'll ever ask of you

Come to my shoulder when you need to weep
Wake me up when you can not sleep
Talk to me when you want to be heard
Be silent with me when you can't say a word

That's all I'll ever ask
That's all I'll ever ask
That's all I'll ever ask
That's all I'll ever ask of you

I can't swear
You'll never have to cry another tear
But whenever you want someone to hold you
I'm always right here

So just take my hand when you stumble and fall
Call my name, it's yours to call
Feel my faith in you when you can't find your own
And always remember you're never alone

That's all I'll ever ask
That's all I'll ever ask
That's all I'll ever ask 
That's all I'll ever ask of you
