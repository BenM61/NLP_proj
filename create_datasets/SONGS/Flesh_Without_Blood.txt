You claw, you fight, you lose
Got a doll that looks just like you
Remember when we used to say
"I love you" almost every day
I saw a light in you
Going out as I closed our window
You never liked me anyway

I don't see the light I saw in you before
And now I don't, and now I don't
And now I don't care anymore

Baby, believe me
If you had every chance
You'd destroy everything you love
(Uncontrollable)
If you don't need me
Just let me go

You hate, you bite, you lose
After all, I just don't like you
It's nice that you say you like me
But only conditionally
Your voice, it had the perfect flow
It got lost when you gave it up though
'Cause you want money
You want fame

I don't see the light I saw in you before
And now I don't, and now I don't
And now I don't care anymore

Baby, believe me
If you had every chance
You'd destroy everything you love
(Uncontrollable)
If you don't need me
Just let me go

Baby, believe me
I don't know how many times
You destroyed everything that you love
(Uncontrollable)
If you don't need me
Just let me go
Baby, believe me
I don't know how many times
You destroyed everything that you love
(Uncontrollable)
If you don't need me
Just let me go

(Uncontrollable)
