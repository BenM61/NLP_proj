Lady, I'm calling you to say
How much you mean to me
Been so lonely since the day
You left me for another guy

Baby, I never really meant
To hurt your love for me
And I want you to know that
It wasn't really serious

Tell me, is it just a waste of time?
Boy, I want you to be mine, all mine
Tell me, is it just a grand illusion?
I think it's time we had a conversation

Today is a brand new day
Come on, let's make it last forevermore
Let's forget about yesterday
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh

Lady, angel of the dreams
I had when I was lonely
I was sleeping alone
Thinking of you all the time

Baby, I promise you
That I will never let you down
You're the man of my life
You're the one I really love

Tell me, is it just a waste of time?
Boy, I want you to be mine, all mine
Tell me, is it just a grand illusion?
I think it's time we had a conversation

Today is a brand new day
Come on, let's make it last forevermore
Let's forget about yesterday
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh

Tell me, is it just a waste of time?
Boy, I want you to be mine, all mine
Tell me, is it just a grand illusion?
I think it's time we had a conversation

Today is a brand new day
Come on, let's make it last forevermore
Let's forget about yesterday
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
