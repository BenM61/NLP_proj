It's another one

I got that juice
New AP
She got that juice (ju-juice)
She got that squeeze (squeeze, squeeze, squeeze)
She got that wet (whip)
I'm on them skis
I got that drip (drip)
I'm overseas (seas)

D-r-i-p-p-i-n-g
I got that VVS i-c-e
Ooh, feels like a cooler
Juice, blame it on my jeweler

I got stones on my neck (ooh)
Blood on my set (ooh)
Water on my wrist (drip)
Put glitter on my bitch (ju-juice)
My ex was a waitress
So I gave that hoe a tip (ooh)
My ex fucked a lame
Now she workin' double shifts (no juice)
Our money ain't the same
You a lame, getit clear (ooh)
I did ten mil in eleven months, not a year (juice)
I gave fifty racks in the club to a pimp (ju-juice)
I blew two mil on my dog for a pill

I got that juice

Aye
Bright banana poured fresh off the runway
Monkey-ass niggas, I think y'all all Bapes
If I see you won't speak, I'm on my Cardi B
Shorty got that night-night, put your ass to sleep
And my label say I got the juice (juice)
Hol' up, aye Yo Gotti, who as hot as you?
Lil' boy talkin' money, know there's too much juice
You may see me with security, but know I'm the one shootin'
I been a boss all my life, I made a millionaire or two
And you might see me in a coupe with the disappearing roof
I had packs, I got plaques, you get texts for the juice
If you ex, you get sex, I'm in Saks with your boo
