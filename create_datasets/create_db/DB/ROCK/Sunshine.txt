Sunshine
If you threw it in the air, babe
I couldn't help but stare, babe
I'd let you love me blind
Sunshine
I'm gonna bathe in your light, babe
All day, all night, babe
Make me wanna say
La-la-la-la-la-la-la

Aye, yep, hey let's take a trip
Down to the beach where the pretty girls live
Away from your condo, way up in the cold
Girl, you too fine to be getting snowed in
You know that shit
You spend your days inside
That ain't how you're designed
Was tan but now you're white (ugh)
Think you could use some shine

On the best coast, on the best coast
Sad days
We don't get those, we don't get those
Do you wanna come zone in the sunshine?
Baby, let's go
Baby, let's go

Come on down to Cali, see what summertime's like
You need to be relieved
You live in fifty degrees

Whatever
All dubs, yup, women, weed, weather
If your home girl hate and bake, go ahead and let her
You out on vacation, your location doing better, yeah

On the best coast, on the best coast
Sad days
