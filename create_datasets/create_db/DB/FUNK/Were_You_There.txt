Them was going to Jerusalem
He met two strangers along the way
They were talking all about the Crucifixion
They stopped and here's what he said, he asked them

Were you there when they crucified the Lord?
(Were you there?)
Were you there when they crucified the Lord?
He asked them, were you there when the crucified the Lord?

And one of them told him
No, sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble
He said I was there
I was there when they crucified the Lord

A fellow said, I want you to tell me if you were there?
Tell me, did they really pierce Him in the side that morn
O Lord, he said if you were there
I wonder did they pierce the Savior in the side?

Sometimes it causes me to tremble
Every time I think about how they did the Lord
It makes me tremble 'cause I was there
And they really pierced him in the side that morning

A fellow said, I want you to tell me if you were there?
If you were there kindly tell me
Did he hang there and never say one word?

Sometimes I have to tremble
Every time I think about how they done the Lord
It makes me tremble
Cause I was there when they crucified the Lord
