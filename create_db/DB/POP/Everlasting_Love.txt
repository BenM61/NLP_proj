Hearts go astray, leaving hurt when they go
I went away just when you needed me so
Filled with regret I come back beggin' you
Forgive, forget. Where's the love we once knew?

Open up your eyes, then you'll realize 
Here I stand with my everlasting love
Need you by my side, wanna be your bride
You'll never be denied everlasting love
From the very start, open up your heart
Be a lasting part of everlasting love
(Real love will last forever, real love will last forever)
 
(Ooh, ooh)
Where life's river flows, no one really knows
'Til someone's there to show the way to lasting love
Like the sun that shines, endlessly it shine
You always will be mine, it's eternal love
When other loves are gone, ours will still be strong
We have our very own everlasting love
Real love will last forever.
(Real love will last forever)
(You'll give me, you'll give me
You'll give me everlasting love)
(You'll give me, you'll give me
You'll give me everlasting love)
(You'll give me, you'll give me
You'll give me everlasting love)

Open up your eyes, then you'll realize 
Here I stand with my everlasting love
Need you by my side, wanna be your bride
You'll never be denied everlasting love
From the very start, open up your heart
Be a lasting part of everlasting love
(Real love will last forever, real love will last forever)
 
Open up your eyes, then you'll realize 
Here I stand with my (everlasting love)
Need you by my side, wanna be your bride
You'll never be denied (everlasting love)
(Everlasting love) everlasting love, everlasting love
(Everlasting love) you know you give me, you know you give me
You know you give it to me (everlasting love)
You know you give me, you know you give me
You know you give it to me (everlasting love)
Everlasting love (everlasting love)
