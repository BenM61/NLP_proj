I look out my window to wish upon my star
And dig out those old memories that's hidden in my heart
But the stars ain't coming out tonight, dark clouds win again
'Cause there's another lonely night movin' in

Why goodbye, why goodbye
Am I blue, my oh my
You could've said you loved me, you could have even lied
So why goodbye, why goodbye

On the day I met you there was love light in your eyes
Yesterday you walked away and didn't even cry
And as I sit alone tonight and think of all we had
Your leavin' me is leavin' me so sad

Why goodbye, why goodbye
Am I blue, my oh my
You could've said you loved me, you could have even lied
So why goodbye, why goodbye
Why goodbye

You could've said you loved me, you could have even lied
Why goodbye, why goodbye
It's just another lonely night, why goodbye
Why goodbye, why goodbye
It's just another lonely night, why goodbye
