Aisha
We've only just met
And I think you ought to know
I'm a murderer
Babies need blood

I have a portrait on my wall
He's a serial killer
I thought he wouldn't escape
Aisha
He got out



We live in a cemetery
A cold and damp place
And science runs through us
Making us Gods

The rules are all Wrong
Every perversion is justified
They honestly believe dead bodies
Anything goes around here



I still want to to be human again
What am I?
What am I?
I'm a murderer



Aisha
I'm confused
Aisha
I'm vibrating



I'm a murderer
The Gods all suck
