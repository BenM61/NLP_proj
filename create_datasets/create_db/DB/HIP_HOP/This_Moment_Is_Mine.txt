Don't look back, there's only things 
You cannot change the past 
You're wasting time asking 
What if you linger on too long 
Pick the roses from the thorns 
Wash with waters of the storm 
See the sun in your bad day 
Smell the flowers in your valley 

This moment is mine 
I'm living inside 
I grow with each breath that I take 
I cherish my freedom 
I'm sharing this joy 
I'm glowing like sunshine 
I'm spreading my wings and I fly 
I'm still as the night 
This moment is mine 
This moment is mine 

Possibilities travel endless through infinite 
Our finite minds cannot see the unknown 
To be in your worry what can change 
Not a thing 
In the spirit of your mind be renewed 
It's not too late, redeem the time, seize yourself 

This moment is mine 
I'm living inside 
I grow with each breath that I take 
I cherish my freedom 
I'm sharing this joy 
I'm glowing like sunshine 
I'm spreading my wings and I fly 
I'm still as the night 
This moment is mine 
This moment is mine 

Sweetest moment passing you by 
Live in the now and let's go 
I can't tell you how it feels (it's) so good 

This moment is mine 
I'm living inside 
I grow with each breath that I take 
I cherish my freedom 
I'm sharing this joy 
I'm glowing like sunshine 
I'm spreading my wings and I fly 
I'm still as the night 
This moment is mine 
This moment is mine
