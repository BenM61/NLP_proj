The girl that I intend to wed 
Just bought a gift for me & said 
"I bought this 'specially 
For all your friends to see 
Open it up, go ahead." 
"Ah, that's awful swell," I said 

I kissed her on the cheek & then 
Began to read the note within 
"In these you'll look real smart 
Because they match your heart" 
& so I took them out 

Clown shoes; so what's it all about? 
Oh no, not clown shoes! 
Maybe I'm in for some mighty bad news 

She laughed at me & called my name 
& all my friends, they did the same 
Thought she was sweet & swell 
& look how hard I fell 
& now I know I was wrong 
So I'll go & put my clown shoes on
