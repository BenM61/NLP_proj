Fifteen minutes, that's all you get
One quarter hour, to get it all together
That's nine hundred seconds to make
Your bed
Fifteen minutes to show the world

You think you're something, that's what it's like
The one and only, the centre of attention
You're on you're high horse,
Then you're on your bike
'Cause you've got fifteen minutes to show
The world
Fifteen minutes to show the world

Blow me kisses forever
Show me this is a love forever

Well, there's been some misunderstanding,
But that don't bother you
You never let it get you down, you can show
Them all next time around
Swallow this sound bite, you won't have time
To chew
'Cause you've got fifteen minutes to show
The world
That's fifteen minutes to show the world

Feed me honey I'll live forever
Throw me money I'll live forever

Fifteen minutes, that's all you get
One quarter hour, to get it all together
That's nine hundred seconds to make
Your bed
And don't go hesitating
'Cause someone else is waiting for his
Fifteen minutes
Fifteen minutes
Fifteen minutes to show the world

Singin' la la la la
