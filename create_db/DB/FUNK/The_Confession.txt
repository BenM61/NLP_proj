Super summer sugar coppin'
In the mornin'
Do your shoppin' baby
Love my lovething

You may disappear
But you'll be back I swear

Would you love to love me baby?
I would love to love you baby now
Would you love to love me baby?
I would love to love you baby now

Super summer sugar croppin'
In the mornin'
Do you shoppin' baby
Love my lovething
Super ride inside my lovething

You may leave the fair
But you'll be back I swear

Would you love to love me baby?
I would love to love you baby now
Would you love to love me baby?
I would love to love you baby now

I keep hearin' mother cryin'
I keep hearin' daddy through his grave
"Little girl, of all the daughters
You were born a woman
Not a slave"

Oh I hate my winsome lover
Tell him I've had others
At my breast
But tell him he held my heart
And only now am I a virgin
I confess

Love my love thing
Love is surely gospel
