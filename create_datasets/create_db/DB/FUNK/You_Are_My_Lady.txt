There's something that I want to say
But words sometimes get in the way
I just want to show
My feelings for you
There's nothing that I'd rather do
Than spend ev'ry moment with you
I guess you should know
I love you so

You are my lady
You're ev'rything I need and more
You are my lady
You're all I'm living for

There's no way that I can resist
Your precious kiss
Girl, you've got me
So hypnotized
Just say that you'll stay with me
Cause our love was meant to be
I promise to love you
More each day

You are my lady, my love
You're ev'rything I need and more
You are my lady
You're all I'm living for

You are my lady, my love
You're ev'rything I need and more
You are my lady
You're all I'm living for

I love your shine, shine, shine
Let's make it last until the end of time

You are my lady, my love
You're ev'rything I need and more
You are my lady
You're all I'm living for
