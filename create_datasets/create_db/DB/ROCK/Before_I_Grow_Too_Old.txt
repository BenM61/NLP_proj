I'm goin' to go out dancin' every night
And I'm gonna see all girls city lights
And I'm gonna do everything that I've been told
But I've got to hurry up before I grow too old
And I'm gonna take a trip 'round the world
And I'm gonna to kiss all girls pretty girls
And I'm gonna do everything with silver and gold
But I've got to hurry up before I grow too old

Because I'm gonna do a lot of things
I know that's wrong
And I hope that I'm forgiven before I've gone
And it will take a lot of prayers to save my soul
But I've got to hurry up before I grow too old
I'm gonna do a lot of things
I know that's wrong
So I hope that I'm forgiven before I've gone
And it will take a lot of prayers to save my soul
But I've got to hurry up before I grow too old
