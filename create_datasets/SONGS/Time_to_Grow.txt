Last night I tried but I couldn't sleep
Thoughts of you were in my head
I was lonely and I needed you next to me
Life is harder since you left
I never meant to do you wrong
And now all is said and done
I hope you won't be gone too long, No

Where do I go
What do I do
I can't deny I still feel something
And girl, I wish you could say you feel the same
You've broken the bond
I gotta move on
But how do I end this lonely feeling?
You've gone, I'm here, alone
I guess it's time to grow

I try to speak, but my words never catch the air
Like you never knew I was there
Take me back to the days when you really cared
Can we make love re-appear?
I can't go on the roads too long
And now all is said and done
I can't go forward if my heart's still where I'm coming from

Where do I go
What do I do
I can't deny I still feel something
And girl, I wish you could say you feel the same
You've broken the bond
I gotta move on
But how do I end this lonely feeling?
You've gone, I'm here, alone
I guess it's time to grow

Crying time is over
I know I can't control her feelings
If she won't return, then I guess I'll be a man
and move on

Time to grow, and move on
Make life better than it was before
Time to grow and move on
Make love better than I did before

Time to grow, and move on
Make life better than it was before
Time to grow and move on
Make love better than I did before

Though you've gone, and I'm here, alone
I guess it's time to grow
