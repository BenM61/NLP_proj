I know I'm kinda strange, to you sometimes 
Don't always say, what's on my mind 
You know that I've been hurt, by some guy 
But I don't want to mess up this time 

[Bridge] 
And I really really really care 
And I really really really want you 
And I think I'm kinda scared 
'cause I don't want to lose you 
If you really really really care 
Then maybe you can hang through 
I hope you understand 
It's nothing to you 

[Chorus] 
My heart's at a low 
I'm so much to manage 
I think you should know that 
I've been damaged 
I'm falling in love 
There's one disadvantage 
I think you should know that I've been damaged 

I might look through your stuff, for what I don't want to find 
Or I might just set you up, to see if you're all mine 
I'm a little paranoid, from what I've been through 
Don't know what you got yourself into 

And I really really really care (And I care about you so much) 
And I really really really want you (I really do want you) 
And I think I'm kinda scared (But I'm scared with every touch) 
'cause I don't want to lose you (Cos I don't want to lose you) 
If you really really really care (If you care for me like you say) 
Then maybe you can hang through (Then maybe you can hang through) 
I hope you understand (I hope you understand) 
It's nothing to you (It's nothing to you, you) 

My heart's at a low (low) 
I'm so much to manage 
I think you should know that (I think you should know) 
I've been damaged 
I'm falling in love (I'm falling in love) 
There's one disadvantage 
I think you should know that I've been damaged (I think you should know that) 
I've been damaged

My heart's at a low 
I'm so much to manage (I'm so much to manage) 
I think you should know that (I think you should know that) 
I've been damaged (I've been damaged) 
I'm falling in love (I love you so) 
There's one disadvantage (I love you so) 
I think you should know that I've been damaged 

And I really really really want you 
And I think I'm kinda scared 
'cause I don't want to lose you 
If you really really really care 
Then maybe you can hang through 
I hope you understand 
It's nothing to you (It's nothing to you) 

My heart's at a low 
I'm so much to manage 
I think you should know that (Ooh I think you should know I've been damaged) 
I've been damaged (I've been damaged baby) 
I'm falling in love (Falling in love with you baby, yeah) 
There's one disadvantage 
I think you should know that I've been damaged 

My heart's at a low 
I'm so much to manage 
I think you should know that 
I've been damaged 
I'm falling in love 
There's one disadvantage 
I think you should know that I've been damaged
