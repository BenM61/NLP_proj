In the middle of May
I met a gal named June;
Took her out in July,
And 'neath an August moon,

And all through Sept'
I kept admiring her charms,
And all through Oct'
We were locked in each others arms!

From November to Jan'
The runaround began!
February and March,
I was a worried man!

It wasn't till April
That she said okay,
And we were married
In the middle of May.

In the middle of May
He met a gal named June;
Took her out in July,
And 'neath an August moon,

And all through Sept'
He kept admiring her charms,
And all through Oct'
They were locked in each others arms!

From November to Jan'
The runaround began!
February and March,
He was such a worried man!

It wasn't till April,
That's the day she said okay,
And they were married
In the middle of May.
