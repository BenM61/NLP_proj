Just let them talk,
If they want to?
That don't bother me.

I'm gonna keep on till the whole wide world knows,
That I really love you, I really love you so.

And let them whisper for they know no-
What's between you and I

I'm gonna keep on, I'm gonna on loving you?
Till the day that I die?

They'll try to brake up our romance,
They didn't stand a chance.

We have the kind of love that so strong,
We'd be together from now on?

They'll say that gossip comes from the devil's workshop,
And only true love can make it stop?

I'm gonna keep on, I'm gonna on loving you!
Till the day that I die?

Oh they'll envy us, of everything that we do.

But I wanna say it's wonderful 
When you love someone,
and that someone and that someone really loves you,
and that someone yeah that someone really loves you,
and that someone and that someone really loves you-

Yeah

And that someone yeah that someone really loves you?
