Who am I foolin'
I really miss you so bad
I talked to friends
We argued, they say that I, I lost the best thing I've ever had
But every time I felt that it made sense
So I decided to go (to go, to go, to go)
Now I regret that its too late to fix it
So I guess I'll never know
If it would've worked out
Or what

I've realized tat I've made a mistake
And I never should've left ya
I never should've left ya
I've realized tat I've made a mistake
And I never should've left ya
I never should've left ya

I never
Never
I never
I never

I shouldn't be surprised when you tell me you're speach-less
I understand, I know the reasons why
With us there's nothing left
I really, really know that I hurt you
Let the truth be told
Its my fault that you're probably happy now
I wish I would've given us a chance to go
I realized that

I've realized that I've made a mistake
And I never should've left ya
I never should've left ya
I've realized tat I've made a mistake
And I never should've left ya
I never should've left ya
I've realized that I've made a mistake
And I never should've left ya
I never should've left ya
I've realized tat I've made a mistake
And I never should've left ya
I never should've left ya

I never
I never
Never
I never
I never
I never

I can't believe I let it all slip away
I can't believe I let it all slip away
That's it?
