It is for me 
The eventual truth
Of that look of the lioness to her man across the Nile
It is that look of the lioness to her man across the Nile

Want to feel my heart break if it must break in your jaws
Want you to lick my blood off your paws

You can't get here fast enough
You can't get here fast enough
You can't get here fast enough
You can't get here fast enough
You can't get here fast enough
You can't get here fast enough
I will swim to you
I will swim to you
I will swim to you
I will swim to you

Whether you save me
Whether you savage me
Want my last look to be the moon in your eyes
Want my heart to break if it must break in your jaws
Want you to lick my blood off your paws

It is for me 
The eventual truth
It is that look of the lioness to her man across the Nile
It is that look of the lioness to her man across the Nile
And you can't get here fast enough
You can't get here fast enough
You can't get here fast enough
You can't get here fast enough
You can't get here fast enough
You can't get here fast enough
I will swim to you
I will swim to you
I will swim to you
I will swim to you
I will swim to you, to you
I will swim to you
