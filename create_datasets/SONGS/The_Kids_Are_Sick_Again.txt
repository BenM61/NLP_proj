The comforting ache
Of the summer holidays
Pointless days pining
Afternoons whining
The suburbs scream
At passers by
The scream of escape
A new siren

Wasted lives
Hope takes flight
I don't mind
Losing self respect
I've done it before
And I'll do it again
I'm stifled tonight
Which is fine
I've done it before
And I'll do it again

I'm hotter than this
Under regular beams of light
Toothpaste smiles
Don't seem so bright

I'm marching on
Don't revise
I don't mind
Losing self respect
I've done it before
And I'll do it again
I'm thwarted tonight
Which is fine
See I've done it before
And I'll do it again

The kids are sick again
Nothing to look forward to
They jumped the cliff again
Future sinks beneath the blue

The kids are sick again
Nothing to look forward to
They jumped the cliff again
Future sinks beneath the blue

The kids are sick again
Nothing to look forward to
They jumped the cliff again
Future sinks beneath the blue

The kids are sick again
Nothing to look forward to ...
