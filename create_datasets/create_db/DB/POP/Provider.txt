She's the mother, I'm the provider
I'm the father, she is my child
She is the brother, I'm the divider
Remember the time
That we used to run wild
We were free

Like a fish in the sea is
When there's nobody fishin' around
To be free
To be what I wanted to be
Spread my wings
And you can't bring me down (yeah)

I am the teacher, she's my student
She is the preacher, I'm her convert
I am the seeker, she is the answer
Making it somehow
Forgetting the hunt
To be free

Like a fish in the sea is
When there's nobody fishin' around
To be free
To be what I wanted to be
Spread my wings
And you can't bring me down (yeah)

We'd often sit at separate tables
We'd share the same bed every night
Forget the morals and the fables
Sometimes they make you feel
That it's not right, it's not right

Well, she is the summer, I am the winter
I am the poet, she is my soul
Sharing it all
'Cause we're always together
Remember the times that I wanted to go
And be free

Like a fish in the sea is
When there's nobody fishin' around
To be free
To be what I wanted to be
Free when there's nobody
Fishin' around

She is the mother, I am the provider
