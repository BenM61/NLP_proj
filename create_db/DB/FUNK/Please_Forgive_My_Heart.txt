I could try to say I'm sorry
But, that won't be quite enough
To let you know the pain that I feel
And, it just won't let up
Oh, it feels like the sky is falling
And, the clouds, clouds are closing in
Where did I lose control?
Where did it all begin?

Please, forgive my heart
It's not that the problem
Lies anywhere in there
I'm a liar
I'm in a dream
Going on my way
Nothing to rely on

There's a time
A silent witness
To the blindness of the night
And, we see reflections so clear
In the blush, blush of the morning light
Time can pass so slowly
When you're faced with burning down
The time is not commuted
It lingers, lingers without a sound

Please, forgive my heart
It's not that the problem
Lies anywhere in there
I'm a liar
I'm in a dream
Going on my way
Nothing to rely on

Please, forgive my heart
It's not that the problem
Lies anywhere in there
I'm a liar
I'm in a dream
Going on my way
Nothing to rely on
