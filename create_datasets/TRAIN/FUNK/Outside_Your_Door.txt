Here I am waiting.
Just waiting.
Anticipating a chance to run into you.
I sit here for hours.
One day I even sat through a rain shower.
For just a glance.
A chance to talk to you.
You're probably wondering how I even know you.
For now you're just my dream.
And when I wake up I hope you talk to me.
Here I sit outside your door.
Talk to me.
I'd be content to just sit here and talk to you.
In my dreams you love me and me only.
The way you kiss and hold me.
Love is what I search and search to find.
But until then I'll just dream for the meantime.
