I was feeling kinda lonely
And I wanted you to hold me tight
So you better come quickly
Come on over to my house tonight
I'm gonna look real sexy
Gonna be your fantasy
I'll be your lady cause you're so good to me

But first, we'll let the music play
Dancing nice and slow
I'll kiss you and say
How much I want you baby
Boy you know you're driving me crazy
I love the way you dance
Baby it's time for romance

So turn down the lights
Come close to me
I'll give you all that you need
Turn down the lights
Baby and I'll be your fantasy

Ooh I like it when you hold me
When you hold me in your arms like this
And you rock me gently baby
I feel the passion burning when we kiss
You make me feel so sexy
Oh so good inside
I'll be your lady
I'll be yours tonight

But first, we'll let the music play
Dancing nice and slow
I'll kiss you and say
How much I want you baby
Boy you know you're driving me crazy
I love the way you dance
Baby it's time for romance

So turn down the lights
Come close to me
I'll give you all that you need
Turn down the lights
Baby and I'll be your fantasy

When I'm with you
I'm on top of the world
Knowing your my man
And I'm your girl
Something about the way you love me baby
Wouldn't change if I could
I've got to have your right now
Cause you feel so good
