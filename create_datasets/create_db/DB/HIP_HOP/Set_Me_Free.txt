I love you, but I gotta go

Ooh-ooh-ooh

Hey-ey

Whoa-oh, sing it, whoa-oh, oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh

Flashback hit me right between the eyes
A girl just came and said to me
'i want you by my side'
So exciting, but not without a doubt (a doubt)
She's locked the door and thrown the key
Someone get me out!

I know she means no harm to me
Fulfilling won't confide in me
It only makes me wanna leave
Set me free!

Set me free, whoa-oh (hmm-mm)
Set me free, whoa-oh (oh, no)
Set me free, whoa-oh
Set me free, whoa-oh
Baby, let me go
Set me free, whoa-oh (hmmm, hey)
Set me free, whoa-oh
Set me free, whoa-oh
Set me free, whoa-oh
Got to get away

Falling, crashing in and out of love
Doing things that boys do
Then she came about
Hey, so delightful, all that I would want (could want)
She locked the door and threw the keep
Won't you let me out?

I know she means no harm to me
Fulfiiling won't confide in me
It only makes me wanna leave
Set me free!

Set me free, whoa-oh (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Set me free, whoa-oh
Set me free, whoa-oh (hmmm, hey)
Set me free, whoa-oh
I've got to go, please let me go
Set me free, whoa-oh
Set me free, whoa-oh (oh)
Set me free, whoa-oh
Set me free, whoa-oh
Got to get away

Let me go
You got me cornered in your sealed love
Let me go
Baby, you got to set me free
