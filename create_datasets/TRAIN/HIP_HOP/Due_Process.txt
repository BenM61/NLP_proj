Yo, from Pittsburgh to Pelan this type shit we be on
When we on inside a cassette deck of your Neon
Or in your navigator whippin' with the CD on
Lone Catalysts, rocking to the break dawn
Make a sucker new jack be gone
He kick his shit, I be like
Yo, you puttin' me on?
You wanna battle? Out to Rawls pick me a beat to freak on
Something with a lotta bass and some highs to tweet on
The drums, I give it a run, you know, turn the heat on
Up in the kitchen, then you'll delish on
Who put me in a top position, J. Sands dishing
No look like Ron Strickland
Make the average MC contemplate, just sitting
Down, the wax spin like merry go round
While I format the verbs and nouns through underground
Now what you're looking for you have found
So now bump to the sound properly laid and mixed down
By no other than my brother, although from different mother
J. Rawls with Sands on the mic, so take cover
The sound makes you bounce like flubber, Ludacris, Danny Glover
Lethal Weapon, so while you're checking

Due process, paying these dues, battling crews
At the same time, livin in life, givin enlightenment
Seeing eye for the blind
Through the darkness of the industry we ministry

I go on like etcetera
And blast my way out the plethora of replicas
Cats steady acting extra
And they parts is non speaking
My skills go without and beyond speaking
Address your congregation like a deacon
Seeking converts, my convo is a honor and a pleasure
You seein me is like Geraldo seein Al Capone's treasure
You the don of mediocrity, I'm the indispensable hero of hypocrisy
Stopping your flow like bureaucracy
Due process, you got blessed by the best of the population

Word to Black Shawn, I see your whole operation
And shut it down, cut it down like rain forest
You see Talib Kweli when you look up the idlest in the thesaurus
I'm the definition of special edition with rack and pinion steering
To make my handling more smooth than aloe and lanolin
Manifesto spitting, my stiletto's hitting
On a ghetto mission to keep it fabulous 
Like a Lone Catalysts composition

Due process, paying these dues, battling crews
At the same time, livin in life, givin enlightenment
Seeing eye for the blind
Through the darkness of the industry we ministry

On a level of metaphors with lies life seems to depreciate
Like automobiles submit its original state
I'm into brothers with registered plates 
Pushing the weight of my spirit
Passing the limit of speed, rhymes per minute
Cerebral engine is infinite
Class, the third eye high beams illuminates the distance
The pressure on pedals accelerates, racing the currents of winds
Making the intangible bend with aerodynamics and panoramic visioning
I see the world we livin in, five gallons of knowledge
A tank full filled with lessons
My temperature gauge measures all of the blessings
For the miles I'm stretching
Passing what is hot and what you got for all you cats on the list
Cause us to be the Catalysts
Of a new era, correcting errors
Learn to love it or leave it alone
Reciting these Nubian poems
From NYC to ATL we got continuous flows

Due process, paying these dues, battling crews
At the same time, livin in life, givin enlightenment
Seeing eye for the blind
Through the darkness of the industry we ministry
