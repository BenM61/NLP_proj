Been thinking 'bout the little thing you said
Doesn't sink in, and you fought above my head
'Cause I'm scared, I can't lie
I don't feel the same inside
I can't decide if I have the heart to confess

And I don't think I'm ready to go in this heavy
I thought we would take it slow
And now you got that feelin'
You say that you mean it
But for me, I just don't know

Ooh, ooh, ooh
I can't see it, I don't feel it
I need to dig a little deeper
I can't say that, I won't say it back
I need to dig a little deeper
Dig a little deeper (Oh)
You, you, oh!
You, you, oh, you!
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Dig a little deeper (Oh)
You, you, oh!
You, you, oh, you!

There ain't no contract
And I go when I choose to leave
And I don't want that
That's not something that I need
And you know that it takes two
And I don't feel the same as you
When I think back on
Does he know I always knew?

And I don't think I'm ready to go in this heavy
I thought we would take it slow
And now you got that feelin'
You say that you mean it
But for me, I just don't know

Ooh, ooh, ooh
I can't see it, I don't feel it
I need to dig a little deeper
I can't say that, I won't say it back
I need to dig a little deeper
Dig a little deeper (Oh)
You, you, oh!
You, you, oh, you!
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Dig a little deeper (Oh)
You, you, oh!
You, you, oh, you! (So dig a little deeper)

Don't feel it in my soul
For you, I just don't know (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Dig a little deeper) I just don't know
Don't feel it in my soul
For you, I just don't know (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Nanana) I just don't know

I can't!

I can't see it, I don't feel it
I need to dig a little deeper (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I can't see you, foresee you
I need to dig a little deeper (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Dig a little deeper, oh
You, you, oh!
You, you, oh, you! (Dig a little deeper)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Dig a little deeper
You, you, oh!
You, you, oh, you! (Dig a little deeper)
