You keep me walking in light
And you keep me walking outside
You keep me decieving in me
And you keep me staring on you

You are made of sun
Take me to the light
You are made of sun
Take me to the light

Try to achieve in your smile
You were able to conquer my eyes
You keep me decieving in me
And you keep me staring on you

You are made of sun
Take me to the light
You are made of sun
Take me to the light
