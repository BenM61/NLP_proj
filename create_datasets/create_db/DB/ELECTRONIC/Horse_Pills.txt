So your ex got a mansion where you kick it on the hill,
Your boy comes to see you, he's your Hollywood thrill.
He's a Spanish fly, that bucks like a stallion.
In the suits that you got him, he looks more Italian.

You worry bout your tan when the weather's gettin' clammy,
Summer in the city and winters in Miami.
You get so high on the high life pills,
Cruisin' and boozin' and rockin' on the horse size pills.

You could even take more thrills 
You could even take more spills,
Pills, thrills, chills and ills man, kills.
And rockin' on the horse size.

Butt's gettin' bigger, do you think he'll notice maybe?
That's ok, don't worry bout it baby!
'Cause everybody knows he pumps you for your money, that's alright,
Don't worry bout it honey!

In your itsy bitsy teenie weenie riding up your butt bikini.
Keepin' on the heels cause you're saggin'
Just a teenie bit more than the girls he pretends he doesn't thrill.
Rubbin' on the lotion, and rockin' on the horse size pills.

You could even take more thrills,
You could even take more spills, pills, thrills, chills, and ills man, kills.
And rockin' on the horse size.
Sometimes you feel like Moses, that's when you're toasted.

Yeah, kick it.
Yo bitch.
That's right, yeah.
Rockin' on the horse size
