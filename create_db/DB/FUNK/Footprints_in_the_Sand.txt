You walked with me
Footprints in the sand
And helped me understand
Where I'm going

You walked with me
When I was all alone
With so much unknown
Along the way

I heard you say
I promise you
I'm always there
When your heart is filled with sorrow
And despair

And I'll carry you
When you need a friend
You'll find my footprints in the sand

I see my life
Flash across the sky
So many times have I
Been so afraid
And just when I
Thought I lost my way
You gave me strength to carry on
Thats when I heard you say

I promise you
I'm always there
When your heart is filled with sorrow and despair

And I'll carry you
When you need a friend
You'll find my footprints in the sand

When I'm weary
Well I know you'll be there
And I can feel you
When you say

I promise you
I'm always there
When your heart is filled with sadness and despair

And I'll carry you
When you need a friend
You'll find my footprints in the sand

When your heart is full of sadness and despair

And I'll carry you
When you need a friend
You'll find my footprints in the sand
