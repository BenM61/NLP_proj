See everybody needs someone by their side
And I can't go on without you another night
Since companionship's been gone
My life has been so slow
Without you, you

See it don't take a rocket scientist to know I love you
See it don't take a rocket scientist to know I need you
See if you believe that you and me can change the world someday
Then believe me when I say
I still love you
I still love you
I decided I still love you
I still love you
I decided

So what do you think
Let's get back together (let's get back together)
There's nothing it could hurt
It could only get better
Think of what it last felt like
When you and I done turned our nights into forever, see

See it don't take a rocket scientist to know I love you
And it don't take a rocket scientist to know I need you
See if you believe that you and me can change the world someday
Then believe me when I say
I still love you
I still love you
I decided I still love you
I still love you
I decided

Never dreamed I'd be so happy
And sure of myself
Baby, life without you is so dark
(so dark, so dark)
Now I know it'll never be me loving someone else
It's precious love
You're my shining star
I remember when we first fell in love
I was too young to know what it was
I couldn't address what made me melt
But quick to tell you how it felt
That life is so real
And it still is

I still love you
I still love you
I decided I still love you
I still love you
I still love you
Just think of the things we planned to do - me and you
I still love you
I'm changing the face of the new world we once knew
I still love you
So long as the sun is shine the oceans are blue
I still love you...
