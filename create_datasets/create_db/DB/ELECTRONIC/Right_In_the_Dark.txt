Another day in a different world
Hard to believe that this is real
I dance and sing instead of walk and talk
Knowing that the time will heal
And I changed my view from all angles
Ain't afraid of no one's eyes
Maybe we should, maybe we don't
Maybe we're giving this a try

Won't you come with me, right in the dark
Won't you come with me, right to the start
Won't you come with me, right in the night
Won't you come with me, and shine a light

Can't tell how we came so far
Or where we went wrong
I'm searching for your sight
But your eyes won't hold me on
And you're trying to tell
What I can't understand
We kept on walking I unlearned to talking
And finally face the end

Won't you come with me, right in the dark
Won't you come with me, right to the start
Won't you come with me, right in the night
Won't you come with me, and shine a light

It's been a couple seasons since we've seen each other
Maybe less, maybe more
It's been a long time hitting the long road
Where it rains and where it pours
Back in the spot that we used to be
Laughing sinners all around
Look at me, give me your hand
And burn that city to the ground

Won't you come with me, right in the dark
Won't you come with me, right to the start
Won't you come with me, right in the night
Won't you come with me, and shine a light
