The KLF featuring Miss Tammy Wynette:
Justified And Ancient (Stand By The JAMs)
All bound for Mu Mu Land
All bound for Mu Mu Land
(hey)
(hey hey)
All bound for Mu Mu Land (justified!)
(hey hey)
All bound for Mu Mu Land
They're Justified, and they're Ancient,
And they like to roam the land.
(just roll it from the top)
They're Justified, and they're Ancient,
I hope you understand.
(to the bridge, to the bridge, to the bridge now)
They called me up in Tennessee
They said "Tammy, stand by the JAMs"
But if you don't like what they're going to do,
You better not stop them 'cause they're coming through
(bring the beat back)
(Hey hey)
All bound for Mu Mu Land (justified!)
(Hey hey)
All bound for Mu Mu Land (justified!)
Mu Mu Land
Mu Mu Land
All bound for Mu Mu Land
They're Justified, and they're Ancient,
And they drive an ice cream van.
(just roll it from the top)
They're Justified and they're Ancient,
With still no master plan.
(to the bridge, to the bridge, to the bridge now)
The last train left an hour ago,
They were singing "All aboard"
All bound for Mu Mu Land,
Then someone starting screaming "Turn up the Strobe"
(bring the beat back)
(Hey hey)
All bound for Mu Mu Land (justified!)
(Hey hey)
All bound for Mu Mu Land (ancients of mu mu)
Rap:
Justified and Ancient, Ancient and a-justified,
Rocking to the rhythm in their ice-cream van
with the plan and the key to
enter into Mu Mu
Vibes from the tribes of the JAMs.
I know where the beat is at,
''cause I know what time it is.
Bring home a dime,
Make mine a "99"
New style, meanwhile, always on a mission while
Fishing in the rivers of life
Fishing in the rivers of life (hoi!)
Fishing in the rivers of life (hoi!)
Fishing in the rivers
Fishing in the rivers
Fishing in the rivers of life (hoi!)
Voo-va-voolie
Za-shi-va-zom
Voo-va-voolie
(Hey hey)
All bound for Mu Mu Land (justified!)
(Hey hey)
All bound for Mu Mu Land (justified!)
Mu Mu Land (ancients of mu mu)
Mu Mu Land (ancients of mu mu)
All bound for Mu Mu Land
Mu Mu Land (ancients of mu mu)
Mu Mu Land (ancients of mu mu)
All bound for Mu Mu Land
Mu Mu Land
Mu Mu Land
All bound for Mu Mu Land
From: "If you lived here, you'd be home now."
