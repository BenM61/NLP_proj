Down on the corner in my home town
Me and the fellows used to gather round
The song we sang it sound so sweet
I can still hear that harmony
Singin de de de de deet
Who, whoa oh ah ah

Guide he's the one that sang down low
Crazy Larry sang the baritone
I'm the one that sang the lead 
Little Jackie made our song complete
Singin de de de de deet
Who, whoa oh ah ah

When a pretty girl would come passing by
We tried too hard to catch her eye
And when she stopped to check us out
That's when we really sang out loud
Singin de de de de deet
Who, whoa oh ah ah

I still remember those happy days
We passed our time in carefree ways
Maybe someday we'll get together again
Down on the corner with my old friends
Singin de de de de deet
Who, whoa oh ah ah
