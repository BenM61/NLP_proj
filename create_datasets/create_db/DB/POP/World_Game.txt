I want to play in the World Game
I want to make it better it's ever been before
I want to play in the World Game
I want to make sure everybody knows the score
About using less, doing so much more

Everywhere I'm going I see trouble
Everywhere I'm looking I see all kinds of pain
Maybe we can get back on the double
Maybe we can turn around and make it all change

They say it's you against your neighbor
If it gets right down to it, you against your friend
I swear that this is not the answer
As far as I can see it is the way it all ends

I want to play in the World Game
I want to make it better it's ever been before
I want to play in the World Game
I want to make sure everybody knows the score
About using less, doing so much more

Hey man, you know me I don't worry
Hey man, you know me I am never afraid
Only one thing can make me sorry
Something to say and then it never gets said

What kind of man turns on his brother
What kind of man turns his back on a friend
Who has the right to say it's over
Who has the right to see how far it can bend

I want to play in the World Game
I want to make it better it's ever been before
I want to play in the World Game
I want to make sure everybody knows the score
About using less, doing so much more

Yaweh yaweh yaweh jah
Yaweh yaweh yaweh jah
Yaweh yaweh yaweh jah
Yaweh yaweh yaweh jah

You and me you and me
You and me you and me

I and I - I and I
I and I - I and I

I want to play in the World Game
I want to make it better it's ever been before
I want to play in the World Game
I want to make sure everybody knows the score
About using less, doing so much more
