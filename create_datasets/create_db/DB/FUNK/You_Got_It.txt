Well you're making a big mistake, girl 
Trying to hold back your love from me 
'Cause there's nothin' I can't do for you 
Sure got the love that you need 

Everything, anything, in the world 
If I can be your man 
I would beg, borrow, 
I would steal for you, honey 
As long as you understand 

You don't have to worry 
What more can say 
To make you understand 
Oooh, that I don't give a damn who knows it 
You are the one, the one I truly need 
Baby won't you listen to me 

You got it, any way you want it 
Any way you want it to be 
You can have it, take it from me 
'Cause it's waiting for you 

Now if something is on your mind, girl 
Got to let me know right away 
I will try my best to smooth it over 
Nothing's going to stand in the way 
Anywhere, anytime, day or night 
Don't make no difference to me 

I will come running, way across town 
As long as I know that you need 
What I have to give 
All that I can to make you feel all right 
You got it, anyway you want it 
Any way you want it to be 
You can have it, take it from me 
'Cause it's waiting for you
