I went out to the insane asylum
And I found my baby out there
I said please come back to me darlin'
What in the world are you doin' here?
Then the little girl raised up her head
Tears was streamin' down from her eyes
And these are the things
That the little girl said

When your love has ceased to be (Lord, have mercy)
There's no other place for me 
If you don't hold me in your arms (Oh child oh child)
I'd rather be here from now on
Some people have an halfway fare
Without your love I ain't nowhere
Oh I can't eat and I can't sleep (oh child oh child)
Lord I can't even live in peace 
Please take me baby for your slave (Oh)
And save me from that early grave
Some people have an halfway fare
Without your love I ain't nowhere

And then sorrow struck my heart
Tears began to stream down from my eyes
The only woman that I ever loved in whole my life
Out here in a place in a condition like this
And I began to thinkin' about what my mama told me when I was a little boy
She told me when I couldn't help myself, to get down on my knees and pray
Then I fell down on my knees
And these are the words that I said

Save me save me save me babe,
Save me save me save me dear,
Whoa I don't know just how we made it
But I'm so glad our love is here
But I'm so glad our love is here
But I'm so glad our love is here
