You don't know me
That's okay
You will trust me
Along the way
You won't see me
Disappear
I don't know if I made myself clear but

I will be you're fire
I will be you're courage
I will be the sun in the dark rainy days
I will be you're highway
I will be you're smile
I will be a weekend on every monday
Monday, Monday Monday

I will be you're weekend on every Monday

You should try me
So you know
If you don't like me
I let you go
You may think that
I'm insane
Give me a reason and I'll take out the play but

I will be you're fire
I will be you're courage
I will be the sun in the dark rainy days
I will be you're highway
I will be you're smile
I will be a weekend on every Monday
Day, day, day

I will be you're highway
I will be you're smile
I will be a weekend on every Monday

I will be you're weekend on every Monday

I will be you're weekend on every Monday

I will be you're weekend on every Monday

I will be you're weekend on every Monday

I will be you're weekend on every Monday

I will be you're weekend on every Monday
