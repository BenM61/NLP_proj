Growing up today
There's many mountains you must climb
You're not the only one
'Cause everybody's on that line
Hey mister know it all
What do you recommend
You think you know the answers
But the questions never end

Young hearts better hold on
Beyond the innocence
Your youth is gone
So look in your mirror
You got nothing to lose
Don't waste your time away
Thinkin' 'bout yesterday's blues

Born outta passion
To a world gone cold
Ya wear it on your shoulders
It's a heavy, heavy load I know
Love and its emotions
Come knocking at your door
Young hearts will be broken
And time's the only cure

Young hearts better hold on
Beyond the innocence
Your youth is gone
So look in your mirror
You got nothing to lose
Don't waste your time away
Thinkin' 'bout yesterday's blues

Temptation makes us fall from grace
But the angels were sinners
And the sinners saints
Forgive yourself cause we're all the same
Everybody rides on the karma train

Young hearts
Better hold on
Beyond the innocence
Your youth is gone
Look in your mirror
It'll tell you the truth
Don't waste your time away
Don't waste your life away, no, no
Live today
There's no time to lose
Cause when tomorrow comes
It's all just yesterday's news

All just yesterday news
