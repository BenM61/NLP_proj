I see the world it slips so far away
Looking back on yesterday
Leaves me nothing more to say

Terror reigns my world, Lord please tell me why
I'm on my knees, I start to cry
I live my life, that's another lie-Controlled by hatred

It feels good, I'm not proud to say
But I'll just put off my guilt, it can wait another fuckin' day

I search you out and now you're right within my reach
And now you'll learn a lesson only I can teach
Now I'm checking it, now I'm checking out
Now I start to scream, it's what it's all about, shout it out
Can you swee what it's all about, shout it out
Now you know what I'm all about

So you can chalk up another soul that's lost
Calculate the social cost
You know not what's inside of me
Raging mad insanity

Scrambled brains I got a toasted mind
Look in my heart therein no goodness are you gonna find
I turned my back to all responsibility
I got no place for all your sensitivity
Now I'm checking out, now I'm checking in, now I star to pray
Just another fuckin' sin, why can't I ever win?
Seems like I never win, it's a sin after sin after sin
Why can't I ever win?

Who am I?
I feel no pain

I close my ears and now I see so clear
I slip away just left all fear
Not a sound, but still I hear-Controlled by hatred

And now the world it slips so far away
Looking back on yesterday
Leave me nothing more to say-Controlled by hatred

I didn't think that I could ever try
Now tears of joy I start to cry
I free my soul and now I fly-Controlled by hatred

The hooterman goes
"What's your name?"-he goes
"What's your name?"-he goes
"What's your name?"-he goes
"You know my name, you know my name!"
What's your name?-my name is terror!
What's your name?-my name is pain!
What's your name?-and you're my reason
I'm controlled by hate, controlled, controlled by hate
My hate

It's gonna gotta gonna gotta gonna gotta get better
It's gonna gotta gonna gotta gonna gotta get better
It's gonna gotta gonna gotta gonna gotta get better
Now the world, my whole world's controlled by hatred
The world, my whole world's controlled by hatred

Who am I?
I feel no pain!
Could it be?
I've gone insane. 
Controlled by hatred!
