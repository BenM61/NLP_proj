Ice cubes on a red hot stove will melt, and I'll bet ya
A drowning man bet his first words are help, and I'll bet ya
If you bet on a horse and the horse don't win, you lose, and I'll bet ya
If you try, to sit on air, you're gonna fall, and I'll bet ya

If you want a winning hand
If you want a perfect man
I'll bet you never lose with love
I'm gonna win, and I'll bet ya
Bet you never lose with love
I'm gonna win, and I'll bet ya

Take a car, without fuel, it ain't gonna move, and I'll bet ya
A carpenter can't build his house without any tools, and I'll bet ya
If your shoes are too small, they hurt your feet, and I'll bet ya
And you can't know what's goin' on, if you're asleep, oh I'll bet ya

If you want a winning hand
If you want a perfect man
I'll bet you never lose my love
You will win and I'll bet ya
Bet you never lose my love
You got to win, I bet ya

I'll bet you never lose my love
