The word is the future, is the future, is future, is the future
Brother, sisters
Get ready for the future
Take a look around you, it ain't workin'
Instead of us, hurt can be a jerk 
It ain't gonna happen man, not today
It's the future, it's the future

We can be lovers or the people
Let's join hands, stopping all the dangers
We can be a better world
For the future

I'm saying that 
Now we're here living in confusion
No one knows what is an illusion
There's a chance for us in the future
I'm singing of the

The future, we can be together
The future, better than the world today
The future, oh, we can be so different
The future

The future, the future
The future, the future

Jealousy and being strife
If we keep this up, we all lose our life
Love and peace is what we need
Today

Look around we can make it happen
It's not hard, we have other reasons
Take a chance and make it last forever

The future, we can be together
The future, don't you worry about a thing, no baby
The future, mothers
The future, fathers, raise your children right

The future, don't worry about them in the future
The future, it will be all, it will be alright
The future, I'm talking about
The future, I'm singing about the future

The future, I
The future, I can't wait for the future
The future, everything will be alright
The future, everything will be alright

It's future, it's the future
It's future, it's the future
It's future, it's the future
It's future, it's the future
It's future, it's the future
It's future, it's the future
It's future, it's the future
It's future, it's the future
It's future, the future, get with the feature, the future
