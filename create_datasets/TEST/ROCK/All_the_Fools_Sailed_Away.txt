There's perfect harmony 
In the rising and the falling of the sea 
And as we sail along 
I never fail to be astounded by the things we'll do for promises 
And a song 

We are the innocent 
We are the damned 
We were caught in the middle of the madness 
Hunted by the lion and the lamb oh, oh 

We bring you fantasy 
We bring you pain 
It's your one great chance for a miracle 
Or we will disappear 
Never to be seen again 

And all the fools sailed away 
All the fools sailed away 
Sailed away 

We bring you beautiful 
We teach you sin 
We can give you a piece of the universe 
Or we will disappear 
Never to return again 

And all the fools sailed away 
All the fools sailed away 
All the fools sailed away 
They sailed away 
Sailed away 

And as we drift along 
I never fail to be astounded by the things we'll do for promises 
And a song 

We are the innocent 
We cut we bleed 
We're your one great chance for a miracle 
And a miracle is something you need 

They'll take your diamonds 
And then give you steel 
You'll be caught in the middle of the madness 
Just lost like them 
And part of all the pain that they feel, yeah 

And all the fools sailed away 
All the fools sailed away 
All the fools sailed away 
Leaving nothing, nothing more to say 
All the fools sailed away 

They say you're beautiful 
And they'll always let you in 
But doors are never open 
To the child without a trace of sin 

Sail away
