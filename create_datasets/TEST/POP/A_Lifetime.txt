Allie woke up 8AM, graduation day.
Got into a car, crashed along the way.

When we arrived late to the wake,
Stole the urn while they looked away,
And drove to the beach 'cause I knew you'd want it that way.

And you were standing on the hood of the car
Singing out loud when the sun came up.

And I know I wasn't right, but it felt so good.
And your mother didn't mind, like I thought she would.
And that REM song was playing in my mind.
And three and a half minutes, felt like a lifetime

Felt like a lifetime

And you move like water, yeah
I could drown in you.
And I felt so deep once, till you pulled me through

You would tell me, "No one is allowed to be so proud
They never reach out when they're giving up."

And I know I wasn't right, but it felt so good.
And your mother didn't mind, like I thought she would.
And that REM song was playing in my mind.
And three and a half minutes, felt like a lifetime

Are you sitting in the lights?
Or combing your hair again,
And talking in rhymes?
Are you sitting in the lights?

When I got home, heard the phone, your parents had arrived.
And your dad set his jaw, your ma just smiled and sighed.

But they left soon and I went to my room.
Played that disc that you'd given me,
And I shut my eyes, swear I could hear the sea.

We were standing on the hood of your car
Singing out loud when the sun came up.

And I know I wasn't right, but it felt so good.
And your mother didn't mind, like I thought she would.
And that REM song was playing in my mind.
And three and a half minutes,
Three and a half minutes, felt like a lifetime.
