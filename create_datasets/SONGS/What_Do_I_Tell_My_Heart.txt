I guess this old overcoat
Will do against the chill
I'll get some good drink and done
With all these hours to kill

I'll summon my courage
Of the little that we make
Look into the future
And strive, get used to the pain

I'll get along without you
I will survive each night and day
Like they say, ?Where there's no choice there's a way?

I'll forget all about you
As soon as I saw this one last part, this part
I keep asking myself, what do I tell my heart?

I told a lie at first
And said you overslept
I tried the bitter hard truth
Just too much to accept

Seems no explainin'
Can put my mind at ease
My heart keeps complainin'
And draggin' me down to my knees

I'll get along without you
I will survive each night and day
Just like they say, ?Where there's no choice there's a way?

I'll forget all about you
As soon as I saw this one last part, this one last part
I keep asking myself what do I tell my heart?

Ask yourself a question
Don't it seem a little strange?
To be both so in love, could dazzle everyone
Suddenly going all the way

I'll get along without you
I will survive each night and day
Like they say, ?Where there's no choice there's got to be a way?

I'll forget all about you
As soon as I saw this one last part, this one last part
I keep asking myself what do I tell my heart

I'll get along without you
I will survive each night and day
There's gotta be a way

I'll forget all about you
This one last part
I keep asking myself what do I tell my heart
What do you tell
