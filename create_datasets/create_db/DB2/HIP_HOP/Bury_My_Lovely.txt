Cover the mirror 
Hide in your dreams 
Forget what they told you 
Forget what it means 

A picture worth a thousand lies 
The memory and the mirror 
Nothing but what came before 
Nothing but a closing door 

A picture woth a thousand lies 
A thousand words 
A thousand eyes 
Bury my lovely 
Hide in your room 
Bury my lovely 
Forget me soon 
Forget me 
Forget me now 
Forget me not 

Cover the madness 
Cover the fear 
No one will ever 
Know you were her 

A figure in the hallway light 
Returning like a ghost 
Something that was left behind 
Something in a child's mind 

A picture woth a thousand lies 
A thousand words 
A thousand eyes 
Bury my lovely 
Hide in your room 
Bury my lovely 
Forget me soon 
Forget me 
Forget me now 
Forget me not 

Bury my lovely 
Bury the lies 
Bury me under 
A thousand goodbyes 

A shadow from another time 
Is waiting in the night 
Something happened long ago 
Something that will not let go 

A picture woth a thousand lies 
A thousand words 
A thousand eyes 
Bury my lovely 
Hide in your room 
Bury my lovely 
Forget me soon 
Forget me 
Forget me now 
Forget me not
