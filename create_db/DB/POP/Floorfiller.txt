Hey Mr. DJ in case you forgot
I came to get down
So you better make it hot

'Cause I can't jump around when I hear
Groove killers
When I'm out sitting down, it's a clear
Time stealer

Give me a track
With a phat kinda beat
A groove so unique
That it kicks me off my seat

'Cause I won't find a mood with a new
Spine chiller
When the crowd hits the room, it's a true
Crowd thriller

Freeze
Better make it hot
Music please
Know the spot
Play that funky music
That is how we want it
Floorfiller
That is how we need it
Floorfiller
Something's out of order
People in the corners
Don't you see it
Can't you feel it
Floorfiller

Crank up the bass
I can raise up the roof
???
Come and knock me with the groove
Gotta boom
Shake the room
'Cause we're all
Heat seekers
With a jam that can slam down the walls
Mind freakers

Freeze
Better make it hot
Music please
Know the spot
Play that funky music
That is how we want it
Floorfiller
That is how we need it
Floorfiller
Something's out of order
People in the corners
Don't you see it
Can't you feel it
Floorfiller

You know by the sounds
When the crowd is getting wild
Hands swinging high
Like a chopper in the sky

But a slow bump or flow ain't the way
Floor freezer
See the name of the game is to play
Crowd pleaser

Freeze
Better make it hot
Music please
Know the spot
Play that funky music
That is how we want it
Floorfiller
That is how we need it
Floorfiller
Something's out of order
People in the corners
Don't you see it
Can't you feel it
