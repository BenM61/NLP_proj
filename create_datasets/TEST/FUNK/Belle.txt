Belle,
The Lord and I have been friends for a mighty long time 
Belle,
Leaving him has never ever really crossed my mind 
Let me say this one thing

I'd never go so far 
Cause it's Him no matter who you are 
Belle,
Oh it's you that I want, but it's Him that I need 
(I'd like to take a minute) just to say now,
Belle,
The laughter of the sound has quieted down 
Belle
The best thing we could do is have Him around 
I'm no planning to leave
Let me say this one thing,
I think if love could've found 
My heart was lost and now it's found 
Belle
Let's you and I let the love come down 

I'm so happy, let me say this,
It seems so easy to me, oh, oh, oh
I've tried to act naturally 
Let's not waste each other's time 

Belle
Lord, He's my surprisin', my pride and my joy, 
Belle
I know that you can understand 
This little country boy 
(I'm just a little country boy) 
Belle
He brought me safe thus far
(Let me say this to you lady)
Through many drunken country bars
Belle,
Oh, let me say,
He's my bright morning star
Belle, Belle
He's my bright morning, his my bright morning
My everything, my everything
Belle,
Belle,
I know you're all of these things girl
Ya, but He's such a brighter joy,
He's! He's! He's!
Jesus is my!
My everything!
My everything!
In the morning (time)
In the evening (time)
In the daytime
In the nighttime

He's my everything, yeah!
Belle,
Belle, Belle, Belle, Belle
Belle, Belle, Belle, Belle
