We began at the beginning,
Moving high and moving fast
Machine's clean, so sweet and mean
Should have known it wouldn't last
But when I took her clothes off
I thought she would explode
Dropped another handful
Kept us on the road, oh yeah

The black things came from nowhere
But they couldn't beat the shield
They flew across the highway
But we smashed them in the field
when I made the suggestion
I thought she would explode
Dropped another handful
Keep us on the road, oh yeah

It was round about the third day
I remember it so clear
We came across a bad vibe
Naked, blinded with fear
And that was all we left there
Ain't moving, staring, cold 
Dropped another handful
Keep us on the road
Oh yeah
