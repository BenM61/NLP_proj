It kinda hit me yesterday
That you'll grow up like me someday
But we're not yet there
It comes a time when you don't know
Only you know better
You make decisions on your own
but we're still here

Whatever they do,
Whatever they say,
Leave it tonight and go your own way
And then you'll sing, you'll do your thing.
Believe me when I say so,
I want you to know how things can feel
Keep you away from what is out there,
I wanna prepare you on for what's real
You'll get by and get it your way,
Whatever they do
Whatever they do

I tell you almost everyday
(Just how much I love you)
You just smile and walk away
(You know I hut you)
We'll be fine

Whatever they do,
Whatever they say,
Leave it tonight and go your own way
And then you'll sing, you'll do your thing.
Believe me when I say so,
I want you to know how things can feel
Keep you away from what is out there,
I wanna prepare you on for what's real
You'll get by and get it your way,
Whatever they do
Whatever they do

Whatever they do
Whatever they do
