I need a voice to hear 
A hand to hold 
A mind to be near 
I need skin to touch 
The scent of hair will mean so much 
I need lips to kiss 
The laughter of someone to miss 
I need to wake up to the sound of you breathing

I need to comfort you 
And let you cry when you have to 
I need to kiss your tears 
And let you be alone

But you don't know what it's like 
But you don't know what it's like

I need to comfort 
And to say that it will be OK 
I want to feel the taste of tears in my mouth 
I want to give away what I got 
And get nothing back 
Except for moments of you love me from the heart

I need to share what I got 
Or else its not worth a lot 
I want to pick up the phone 
And apologize

But you don't know what it's like 
But you don't know what it's like

I met a man whose mission was to 
Crawl across the land 
He called me lucky because of what I was made 
Hey man take my shoes take my coat 
And understand 
I am a salesman and sorrow is my trade

I share what I got 
But you don't know what it's like 
I share what I got 
But you don't know what it's like 
I share what I got 
But you don't know what it's like 
I share what I got 
But you don't know what it's like 
I share what I got 
But you don't know what it's like 
I share what I got 
But you don't know what it's like

I need to share what I got 
Or else its not worth a lot 
I want to pick up the phone 
And apologize
