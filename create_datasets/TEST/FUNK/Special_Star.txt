When the stars no longer shine
When the sunb falls from the sky
I will be forever yours
You will be forever mine
There's a special star that shines
Every evening in your eyes
There's a special star that shines
Each time I hear that lullaby
There's a special star that shines
Every evening in your eyes
Special star, special star...
