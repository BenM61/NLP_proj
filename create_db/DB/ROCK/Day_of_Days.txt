We sailed on sun soaked seas
And we sailed
Late on the day of days

And desire and pride and anger
Fade away
Washed on the sea of change

We came. in search of saviours
Round the world
And through the cities and the towns

There was a crowd no man could number
Walking down
Taking the chosen road

We passed through the last aurora
And we rise
Soul kites in a diamond sky

Boarding the morning of the free
Re-born in the dawning, complete

I knew a man who couldn't see
I knew a man who couldn't feel
I knew a man who couldn't talk
I knew a man who couldn't walk
I knew a man, I knew a man
I knew a man
