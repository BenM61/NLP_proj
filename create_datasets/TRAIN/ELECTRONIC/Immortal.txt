I do not know the mind of God
And I can not guess his thoughts
But I have searched for you across the void
When my sense of self was lost
The answers danced to brush my grasp
In the darkness and the pain
And I saw myself for all I am
Through decisions I have made

With hearts immortal
We stand before our lives
A soul against oblivion
Forever asking why
This upside-down symphony
In a paradox called life
Are hearts immortal
What you give to love
Will never die

And when my ashes scatter me
With my memories to the wind
What endures beyond the silent edge
Is the essence found within
Have we forgotten truly who we are
And what our living means
Our purpose lies in others' eyes
And the realities that we bring

With hearts immortal
We stand before our lives
(Stand before our lives)
A soul against oblivion
Forever asking why
This upside-down symphony
In a paradox called life
(Stand before our lives)
Are hearts immortal
What you give to love
Will never die

All that I am and all that I dream
Lives somewhere beyond your image of me
And who I become and what I will be
Is not yours to decide
It comes only from me

With hearts immortal
We stand before our lives
A soul against oblivion
Forever asking why
This upside down symphony
Is a paradox called life
Are hearts immortal
What you give to love
Will never die
Will never die
Will never die
