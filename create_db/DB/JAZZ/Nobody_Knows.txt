Once I lived the life of a millionaire
Spending my money, I didn't care
I carried my friends out for a good time
Buying bootleg liquor, champagne and wine

Then I began to fall so low
I didn't have a friend, and no place to go
So if I ever get my hand on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till them eagle's green

Nobody knows you when you down and out
In my pocket not one penny
And my friends I haven't any
But If I ever get on my feet again
Then I'll meet my long lost friend
It's mighty strange, without a doubt
Nobody knows you when you down and out
I mean when you down and out

Mmmmmmmm, when you're down and out
Mmmmmmmm, not one penny
And my friends I haven't any
Mmmmmmmm, well I felt so low
Nobody wants me round their door
Mmmmmmmm, without a doubt,
No man can use you wen you down and out
I mean when you down and out
