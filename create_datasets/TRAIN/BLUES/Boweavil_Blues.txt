Hey boweavil, don't bring them blues no more
Hey boweavil, don't bring them blues no more
Boweavil's here, boweavil's everywhere you go

I'm a lone boweavil, been out a great long time
I'm a lone boweavil, been out a great long time
For to sing this song
To ease boweavil's troublin' mind

I don't want no sugar put into my tea
I don't want no sugar put into my tea
The mens are so evil
I'm scared they might poison me

I went downtown
I bought myself a hat
I brought it back home
I laid it on the shelf

I looked in my bedroom
Tired sleepin' by myself
I'm tired sleepin' by myself
