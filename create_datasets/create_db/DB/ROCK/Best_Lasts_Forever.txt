I feel like a sun without a sky
Feel like a socket without an eye
Feel like a house , but not a home
Just a dog without a bone

How can you wink without an eye?
Like a grievance, but with no cry
A house, not a home and I don't know why
Just a pig without a sty
The best lasts forever

Feel like a sail but I've been slashed
A vigilante that's been unmasked
Feel like a raft, but not a ship
Sinking on this south facing tip
I know that before when you answered the door
I told you the world to leave me
The best lasts forever, together again

Have you ever felt like a story untold?
A catwalk model that's growing old
Hard to imagine what's more important
The rainbow, the pot or the gold
I know that before when you answered the door
I told you the world to leave me
The best lasts forever, together again

Thinking about what it is that made you change
Was it the quarks, the dosh or the dames
When did I become so deranged?
Think of the time when blood ran through your veins
When she looked as sweet as a candy cane
As she looks through the window pane
Through the window pain and the rain
I said it again and again
The best lasts forever
I know that before when you answered the door
I told you the world to leave me

I've been on my knees on so many streets
Not just the ones in dundee
Feel on my face, been a leglass disgrace
Ten thousand laughing at me, but still
The best last forever
