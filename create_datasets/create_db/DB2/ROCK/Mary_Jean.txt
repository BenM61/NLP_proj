She came into my life like a bombshell 
One look and I fell for little Mary Jean 
She walked cool with her head always held high 
The glow in her eyes made her look like a queen 

A little queen, Mary Jean 
She took a hold of my heart and held me under a spell 
I guess she knew me real well 
Just why we hung together through all those tears 
I couldn't tell you now in a million years 

I didn't think that the cause of my downfall 
Would be pretty and small like little Mary Jean 
And I couldn't know when I held her that first night 
(feeling ever so right) that one day it would end 
In a scene. Mary Jean 

Now she's gone yes she's gone and I think I'll be alright 
But then the phone rings at night 
She's on the line again and it's just no fun 
We've got a bad connection, Mary I've gotta run 
Hey now I just had to tell her to go away 
It's so unexciting around here today 

I'm standing here looking down at my shoes 
With a case of the blues over little Mary Jean 
She was so pretty and small 
She was the cause of my downfall 
We used to fuss and fight 
And I dream about her every single night
