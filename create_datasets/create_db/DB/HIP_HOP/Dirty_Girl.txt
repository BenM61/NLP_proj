She so dirty(yeah I see)
1) I'm a clean girl.
And I ain't try'na glory 'bout myself.
But I ain't try'na loose to someone else.
Loneliness I already felt.
'Cause of some dirty girl,ooh,ooh,ooh

Chorus:Oo dirty,ooh,ooh,ooh
See ya in the club,ooh,ooh,ooh
How you rip it off.
She so dirty,ooh,ooh,ooh.
So flirty,ooh,ooh,ooh
Takin'every thug,ooh,ooh,ooh.
Whyn't cha shake it up.
She so dirty.

Bitch you know da bitch ova there.
(I've seen her look)
I know you know da bitch ova there.
That's alright wit me.
She ain't got nothin' ova me.
And I know she ain't got the keys.
But she don't do nothin'fo free.
Dirty girl please.
Try'na ride.
But I'm already inside.
And she can't come crush my world.
Especially when she's a dirty girl,
dirty girl,dirty girl.

2) I'm a clean girl.
I'm trying to see.
That I don't do these things.
Fo'll these things.
There's a time and place.
What's the challenge.
If there is no change.
Answer...A dirty girl,ooh,ooh,ooh.
