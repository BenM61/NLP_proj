Girls I like them fat, I like them tall 
Some skinny, some small 
I got to get to know them all 

Girls I like them fat, I like them tall 
Some skinny, some small
I got to get to know them all

Girls love the things they know
Love the things they show
Have to be where they go
Pretty girls the sunshine in the air
The perfume that they wear
Girls are everywhere

I like to be on an island
With five or six of them fine ones
With one to be in good looking
And one to do best cooking
Give me one with a lot of money
Give me two with a lots of honey
Give me three to do freaky things
Give me four or five more that like to swing

Superfine mighty fine
Sugar and spice and everything nice

I like to be a magician
Then I could start wishing
I'd take a magic wand and poof I'd have me fun
If the guys could see me they'd swear I was Houdini
Before they'd count from 1, 2, 3
I'd have ten girls sitting next to me
