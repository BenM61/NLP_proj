I know a cat named Way-Out Willie
He got a cool little chick named Rockin' Billie
Do you walk and stroll with Susie Q
And do that crazy hand jive too?

Papa told Willie "you'll ruin my home
You and that hand jive has got to go"
Willie said "papa, don't put me down
Been doin' that hand jive all over town"

Hand jive, hand jive
Hand jive, doin' that crazy hand jive

Mama, mama, look at uncle Joe, look at him
He's doin' that hand jive with sister Flo
Even gave baby sister a dime, hey, hey
Said "do that hand jive one more time"

Well, a doctor and a lawyer and a indian chief
They all dig that crazy beat
Way-Out Willie gave them all a treat, yeah
When he did the hand jive with his feet

Hand jive, hand jive
Hand jive, doin' that crazy hand jive, hey, hey
Come on, sugar, yeah!

Well, Willie and Billie got married last fall
They had a little Willie Junior and that ain't all
You know that baby got greatness and it's plain to see, hey, hey
Doin' that hand jive on T.V., come on

Hand jive, hand jive
(Why don't you) hand jive, doin' that crazy hand jive

Hey, hey, well
Yeah, yeah
