What you want to come back here for?
Thought you're with your uptown friends
Don't need none of your junkie business
You gonna screw us up again

Get your blackjack off my table
Get your coat out of my rack
We don't need you 'round here, jerkoff
Chuck, I want you off my back

'Cause we've almost made it
We've almost made it
We've almost made it to the top

Got a gun from Uncle Freddy
Got a station all picked out
Got a plan and now we're ready
Gonna take that station out

So you go on about your business
You just leave use folks alone
We don't need no two-bit junkie
Screwin' up our happy home

'Cause we've almost made it
We've almost made it
We've almost made it to the top

We've almost made it
We've almost made it
We've almost made it to the top
