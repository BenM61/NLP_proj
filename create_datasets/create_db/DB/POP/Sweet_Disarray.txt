Sweet disarray
the street I'd call home is the street I walk alone
Same every day
I never recall getting lost and getting old
Sweet disarray
Same every day

Sweet disarray
I never found home again that day
Stayed in the rain
I never found home again that day

Sweet disarray
my mind has given way to an age that's color gray
And long do I crave
a day that doesn't stall than a day that I recall
Sweet disarray
Same every day

Sweet disarray
I never found home again that day
Stayed in the rain
I never found home again that day

Won't you buy my sweet disarray?
I never found home again that day
Sweet disarray
I never found home again that day

Sweet disarray
Same everyday
Sweet disarray
Same everyday
