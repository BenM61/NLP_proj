I've been thinkin'
Was it all a different scene in my head?
Ooh
You've got powers
You instructed all the demons instead
Mmm

Ooh, everyone sees a man so tall, so perfect, they said
Yeah, you've got ambition
I thought we would grow in time, I wasn't prepared
And now, am I forgiven?

Oh
You look like you're so damn scared
I don't really think you care
You know, you know that our time is through
"It's over when I leave," you said, "we're never gonna meet again"
You played your game, it was all for you

Ooh, ooh
Ooh
It's all for you

Is it always just a stand in for a man that can't heal?
Ooh
I've got arrows, am I shooting through the sky for us still
Na, na, na
And I have a spent a year, wondering if I had all of the blame
Ah, yeah (ah yeah)
And love's a bitter fruit if you choose to remain in your shame
But you couldn't listen, no

You look like you're so damn scared
I don't really think you care
You know, you know that our time is through
"It's over when I leave," you said, "we're never gonna meet again"
You played your game, it was all for you

Ooh, ooh
Ooh
It's all for you
Ooh, ooh
Ooh
It's all for you

Kneeling at your temple, love was accidental
Singing bruises, I was foolish
Thinking I was careful, losing every battle
Singing bruises, I was foolish
No hands, no rush
No touch, no drug
No blood, no love
I'm doing it all for you
No hands, no rush
No touch, no drug
No blood, no love
I'm doing it all for you

You look like you're so damn scared
I don't really think you care (don't care)
You know, you know that our time is through (you know that our time is)
"It's over when I leave," you said, "we're never gonna meet again"
You played your game, it was all for you

I said, "so long", I said, "so long"
I said, "so long", it's all for you
I said, "so long", I said, "so long"
I said, "so long", it's all for you
