I caught some feelings
Now I sense a change
Something beautiful has slipped away
I let you in and then you disappear
Like the dying of another day
I was never planning on
Any of this chaos
I wasn't being difficult
But you still betrayed us

Now I'm stuck in a rut, kicking stones
Looking at my phone all night
Maybe I've lost my mind
When I couldn't breathe
Couldn't sleep
And you say it served me right
Maybe I've lost my mind

You're on the ceiling
I'm down here on the floor
Keeps me coming back
Keeps me begging for more
I knew there'd be other girls
And I liked the danger
Once or twice I've seen your soul
We weren't always strangers

Stuck in a rut, kicking stones
Looking at my phone all night
Maybe I've lost my mind
When I couldn't breathe
Couldn't sleep
And you say it served me right
Maybe I've lost my mind

You wouldn't give me closure
Let me get off the ride
And now I'm getting closer
To the other side

Now I'm stuck in a rut, kicking stones
Looking at my phone all night
Maybe I've lost my mind
When I couldn't breathe
Couldn't sleep
And you say it served me right
Maybe I've lost my mind

Stuck in a rut, kicking stones
Looking at my phone all night
Maybe I've lost my mind
Stuck in a rut, kicking stones
Looking at my phone all night
Maybe I've lost my mind
