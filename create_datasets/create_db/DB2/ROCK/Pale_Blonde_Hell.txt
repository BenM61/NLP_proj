Her face was white as meerschaum 
Washed up by the sea
Her hair was as yellow 
As a field of blowing wheat
Her name I don't remember too well 
Pale blonde hell

She reminded me of someone 
I knew way back when
She reminded me of the one 
Who taught me how to sin
She was like an angel who just fell 
Pale blonde hell

It is not her fault 
That she was the way she was
It is not my fault 
My heart does the things it does
Now I'm at the bottom of this well 
Pale blonde hell

Yeah my baby left me 
And I have a tale to tell
So I'll crawl down lonely street 
Past Heartbreak Hotel
To the place where my lover dwells
Pale blonde hell
