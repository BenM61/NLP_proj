First thing early morning
I'm gonna pack my tears away
Got no cause to look back
I'm lookin' for me a better way
You see the thing 'bout love
Is that it's not enough
If the only thing it brings you is pain
There comes a time when we could all make a change

Just let go
And let it flow, let it flow, let it flow
Everything's gonna work out right you know
Let go, and let it flow, let it flow, let it flow
Just let it go

Don't nobody want no broke heart
And don't nobody want two time losers
Ain't nobody gonna love you like you are
If you take whatever he brings your way
You see the thing of it
Is we deserve respect
But we can't demand respect without change
There comes a time when we must go our own way

Just let go
And let it flow, let it flow, let it flow
Everything's gonna work out right you know
Let go, and let it flow, let it flow, let it flow
Just let it go

Some times love it can work out right
Sometimes you'll never know
But if it brings only pain in your life
Don't be afraid to let it go
