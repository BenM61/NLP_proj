Monday is shining
You know 'em Tuesday's rain
Well, the days go by me
Like a southbound train
Yes, it's funny thinking
You will never call my name
Here comes long lonely
Here comes the blues
Well, the world's the same old comedy

You know my time is cold
Nothing new, blue lady
I won't get old
Cause the deal is gone now
I'd just better hold
Here comes long lonely
Here comes the blues
Well, sun has run down
She has gone out to hide
Yes, and now I'm out walking
Where the midnight ride
Just me and the good-time Charlies

And the suicide
Here comes long lonely
Here comes the blues
Well, Monday's dry
Yes, and Tuesday's just the same
Maybe come down blue Wednesday
I'm gonna grab the brakes again

Cause no bottle of pills
Could ever kill this pain
Here comes long lonely
Here comes the blues
Here comes long lonely
Here comes the blues
