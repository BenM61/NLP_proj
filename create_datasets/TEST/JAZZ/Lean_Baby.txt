My lean baby - tall and thin
Five feet seven - of bones and skin
But when she tells me maybe she loves me
I feel as mellow as a fellow can be
She's so skinny - she's so drawn
When she stands sideways - you (would) think (that) she's gone
But when she calls me: "baby" - I feel fine
To think she's frantically, romantically mine
She's slender, but she's tender
She makes my heart surrender
And every night, when I hold her tight
The feeling is nice - my arms can go around twice
My lean baby - she's so slim
A broomstick's wider - but not as trim
And when she starts to kiss me - then I know
I love her so, I'll never, ever, let her go
My lean baby - strange to see
And all that nothing - it belongs to me
And though she may be scrawny - she's OK
Because I wouldn't want her any other way
She's so skinny - she's so drawn
When she stands sideways - you (would) think (that) she's gone
But when she calls me: "baby" - I feel fine
To think she's frantically, romantically mine
I chased her - and I caught her
Then a diamond ring - I bought her
(Hey) The diamonds shine - the ring is so fine
But here is the twist - she wears it right on her wrist
My lean baby - she's so slim
A broomstick's wider - but not as trim
And when she starts to kiss me - then I know
I love her so, I'll never, ever, let her go
My lean baby - tall and thin...
(do-do-do-do-do,...)
