We've got the Cadillac, we're gonna drive right into the sun.
You're a tight piece of ass, but you know you're my only one.
We make the rules, and we both know what's got to be done.
So pull up your dress, I'm gonna show you how the west was won.

We've got tonight, we've got forever.
Let's get to work, because nobody does it better.
We're gonna swerve all around, 
A-a-all over the road.

You've got the sandwiches packed, and my beer's sweating on the seat.
You've got your black dress on, with your high heels next to your feet.
I've got a big appetite, and you know a man has got to eat.
Well you love your candy, open up for something twice as sweet.

We've got tonight, we've got forever.
Let's get to work, because nobody does it better.
We're gonna swerve all around, 
A-a-all over the road
