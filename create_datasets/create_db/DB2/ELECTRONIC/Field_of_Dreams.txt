I''m standing here in my field of dreams,
Your love has passed me by it seems,
And the sun has hidden his face for another day.
I''m gonna take you by the hand,
And lead you through these precious lands,
And listen to the words you have to say.

Come on baby take hold of me,
Feel my dreams and set me free,
I know the truth and i know you believe,
You touch supplies my energy.
Come on baby take hold of me,
Feel my dreams and set me free,
I know the truth and i know you believe,
Your touch supplies my energy.

Its a matter of fact and its plain to see,
The love that burns inside of me,
I like to lead you back here by my side.
These memories might never last,
A broken dream held from the past,
And a passion that is lost within my mind

Come on baby take hold of me,
Feel my dreams and set me free,
I know the truth and i know you believe,
Your touch supplies my energy.
Come on baby take hold of me,
Feel my dreams and set me free,
I know the truth and i know you believe,
Your touch supplies my energy.
