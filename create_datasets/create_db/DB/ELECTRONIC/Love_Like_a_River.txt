Time was my life
Was like the dersert sand
Desolate without a drop of precious rain.
You don't know the emptiness I felt inside
Right before you came into my life.
My days were dark as nights
There was no way out in sight
Now from that lonely wilderness I've been lifted.
Your love like a river is flowing
Rush over me
Like the seven seas keep rolling.
Your love like a river is growing
Deep inside of me I can feel it overflowing
Your love like a river.
Now I know I've just been wasting time
A desperate man whose soul was slowly dying.
And the healing power I needed then was in your touch
You've changed my life
You've given me so much.
My days were dark as nights
There was no way out in sight
Now from that cold and shallow life I've been lifted.
Your love like a river is flowing
...
Roll me on and on
I'm drawn to you
Can't help myself
Roll me on and on
Roll me on and on
Before I came to you -
May days were dark as nights
There was no way out in sight
Now from that cold and shallow life I've been lifted.
Your love like a river is flowing
...
Your love like a river is flowing
...
