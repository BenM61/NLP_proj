Marionette, your dress is all wet
Did someone leave you outside in the rain,
Or is it the pain
That makes all the puppet tears
Roll down your cheek
Or does the roof leak?

Marionette, how could you forget?
I told you your bright shining varnish
Would peel
And how does it feel
With the bright rouge all faded and
The smile almost cracked
Now that you've come back?
Back to the toy shop by Brandenburg Gate
I hope not too late
'Cause my hands are much stiffer
Than they were when first I
Painted your eyes.

Marionette, no you're not finished yet;
I'll mend you and make you like new,
Paint your eyes blue,
And make you as young as I was myself,
And there on the shelf...
You'll sit till the Puppet Man
Comes round again.
