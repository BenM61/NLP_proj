Packed up all the pain
Left the tears outside my door
And I'm not gonna be the one
Who's left out in the rain no more

I see it so clearly
The writing is on the wall
Tellin? me I'm gonna be
Alright after all

Now I've opened my eyes
And I'm finally wise, no, no
No fool no more

No fool no more
Not like before
Not the way it used to be
No fool no more

No tears this time
?Cause this time I'm wise
To the game that's been goin? on
And I'm not gonna be no fool no more
No fool

No room for sad regrets
?Cause the past is done and gone
And I've learned that it?s time that makes you wise
And truth that makes you strong

You thought you were so cool
Pull the wool right over my heart
But now you see that you can't keep
This heart in the dark

?Cause I've seen through your eyes
Won't be blind one more time, no, no
No fool no more

No fool no more
Not like before
It's not the way it used to be
No fool no more

No tears this time
?Cause this time I'm wise
To the game that's been goin? on
And I'm not gonna be no fool no more

Gonna pull my heart together
Gonna leave the past behind
Gonna get to somethin? better
Put you out of my mind, yeah

I'm gonna be strong
I'm gonna be fine
I just want you to know
That I'm not gonna be no fool no more

No fool no more
Not like before
Not the way it used to be
No fool no more

No tears this time
?Cause this time I'm wise
To the game that's been goin? on
And I'm not gonna be no fool no more

No fool no more
Not like before
Not the way it used to be
No fool no more

No tears this time
?Cause this time I'm wise
To the game that's been goin? on
And I'm not gonna be no fool no more

No fool no more
Not like before
Not the way it used to be
No fool no more

No tears this time
?Cause this time I'm wise
To the game that's been goin? on
And I'm not gonna be no fool no more

No fool no more
Not like before
Not the way it used to be
