Once upon a lifetime
The spirits of the dark
Came to kill the beauty
Of our world

Every soul was spell bound
And prisoned into ice
Just shining through
Sad as a blue tattoo

[Chorus]
Tears have turned to ice
As a sacrifice
Broken voices rise
From the age of the ice
To the raging skies
And they exorcise
'Cause on judgment day
We must hide - we must fight - we must pray - hey
It's a blue tattoo

But the monks of mercy
They prayed for every soul
'Til the sword of fire
Took control

In a crash of thunder
The ice broke into two
And shining through
There was the blue tattoo

[Chorus]

You know
Down low
There's a light - it's a true - blue tattoo
Just go
Down low
Gotta hide now - gotta fight now - 
Gotta save your soul and pray
Gotta break the ice away
Gotta find the true blue tattoo
