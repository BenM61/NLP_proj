So maybe I lose my heart
Is that so much to shout about
I spent the nights counting the stars
This kind of love is not the love
That was given to us
The distance between us is everything now

Every word getting stranger
Now that I see the paint of you 
Every move getting weaker
You're the gesture I feel from you
No more lies could make me believe
I'm helpless inside of it all

Cause in this crazy world
A pleasure those, and I don't want
I need to know where I belong
I only want to see what this has done to you and me
Afraid if I turn on with nothing at all
