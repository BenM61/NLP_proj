Right, that's all it is right 
Two eight days in the mother fucking house 
You know you get fresh within the stomach without 
Its like D.O.P.E and my name is Jay 
But you can call me super yeah 28 Days 
Your fired up getting busy get your head pumping 
Right in the fucking house and the crowd is like thumping 
Melt a little wax and now that is a fact 
And you know I get fatter I don't ya think 
I would know that 

That's all it is right 

His name is herbert now be don't be so wacked 
He'll try to come on till his mad at his axe 
On his bass as he kicks it till he fucks up the mix 
Triple the help with a funky bass richer 
Or we got the fat part on drums and you know it 
If there's a cover up so that you know he will throw it
If there's a hook up you know that he'll fold 
His a bottle with a fat axe I know he won't blow it 

Right, that's all it is right
