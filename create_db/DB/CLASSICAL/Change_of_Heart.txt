I feel that I'm at a crossroads
I don't know which way to go
You say that I am changing
Into someone that you don't know
Who I am and who I'll be
Is locked inside, inside of me

And if I follow my heart
Will you still be my friend
If we break apart?
How do I make, how will you take
My change of heart?

For years you have been my bestfriend
I thought that would always be
You know that I just can't pretend
It's written all over me
'Cuz where I'll go
And what I'll do, I just can't see
My life without you

If I follow my heart
Will you still be my friend
If we break apart?
How do I make, how will you take
My change of heart?

Moving on is gonna take some time
When I'm gone, you might have
A change of mind
Gotta take the chance,
No matter what I find.

No matter how far I travel
I think of you as home
Its not about finding someone else,
Its all about being alone
Because who I am and who I'll be
Is locked inside, inside of me
'Cuz if I follow my heart
Will you still be my friend,
If we break apart?
How will I make, how will you take
My change of heart?

How will you take
My change of heart?
