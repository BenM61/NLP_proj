Every single time you take me out with you
You always flirt around with someone new
But I never criticize the sinful things you do
'Cause I'm so afraid of losing you

But in my lonely room, tears I don't have to hide
'Cause I just lock my door & let myself go
& lay right down & cry

But in my lonely room, tears I don't have to hide
'Cause I just lock my door & let myself go
& lay right down & cry

Every place we go, people are whispering
About your flirting ways, & it hurts me so to hear
But in the publics eye I just push behind all my hurt inside
& pretend i don't mind

But in my lonely room, tears I don't have to hide
But In my lonely room
Tears I don't have to hide
But in my lonely room, All I do is sit right down and cry
Oh in my lonely room
All I do is lock my door
All I do is lay right down and cry
I push my pride aside & lay right down & cry

...& fade
