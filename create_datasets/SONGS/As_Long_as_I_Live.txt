As long as I live if it be one hour
Or it be one hundred years
I'll keep remembering forever and ever
I'll love you, dear, as long as I live

It was easy said that night we parted
That we'd forget we'd ever met
I haven't forgotten, I wonder if you have
Or if your heart is full of regret

As long as I live if it be one hour
Or it be one hundred years
I'll keep remembering forever and ever
I'll love you, dear, as long as I live

I never thought that night we parted
That life without you would be this bad
It may sound funny but I can't forget you
The only happiness I've ever had

As long as I live if it be one hour
Or it be one hundred years
I'll keep remembering forever and ever
I'll love you, dear, as long as I live
