Ah yeah!
Yeah!
It's all about you, one time!
I'mma say it's all about you baby, yeah!
It's all about you, it's all about you, yeah
This Dru Down in the house
With my boy 'Pizznac you knowhat I'm sayin'? (It's all about you)
Yeah I'm gon' say it's all about you
But you know I'm lyin' though, hah! Yeauh

You probably crooked as the last trick
Wanna laugh about how I got my ass caught up with this bad bitch
Thinkin' I had her but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck I'm stuck with fuckin' with the wrong one, uh
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin'
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin' with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin' for some love
In every club
I see you starin' like you want it
Well baby, if you got it better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin' these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
I try to holla but you tell me you taken
Sayin' you ain't impressed, with the money I'm makin'
Guess it's true what they tellin' me
Fresh out of jail, life's hell for a black celebrity
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you with it
Fantasies of us sweatin', can I hit it?
Addicted to the things you do, but still true
What I'm sayin' boo, is this is all about you

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

I make a promise if you go with me
Just let me know, I'll have you hollerin' my name out before I leave
Nobody loves me I'm a thug nigga
I only hung out with the criminals and drug dealers
I love niggas 'cause we comin' from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa and I don't even care
Creep low, weed smoke's in the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Waitin' for niggas at the end of every show
I just seen you in my friend's video
I never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin' through
It's all about you
Yeah nigga
It's all about you

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Is you sick from the dick or is it the flu?
It ain't about you or your bitch ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty ho
You think it's all about you? Well boo
I gets down like Dru and my nasty new niggas, too

You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Gold digging, cold digging a gold Rolex

I slide in easily, try a grizzly
Sluts know the cuts, I came to f*ck, try skeezin' me
Runnin' up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most, I fucked a bitch from the west coast to West Virginia

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
I see the same hoes in the studio
Or kickin it in the video
It's gotta be the same ass and thighs
But you'se a groupie baby and don't look surprised
I can see it in your eyes that you nuthin' but a trick
Hangin' with us for some superstar dick
Wanna autograph placed on her napkin
After she asks ain't you the Top Dogg and don't you be rappin'
She know what's crackin, free shows like loot
From limos down to the Lexus Coup
We be flossin'
And all females love that
Especially when you're dope platinum and you own wax
When I met you I really didn't have to say much
'Cause me alone just made you wanna taste and touch
Don't be trippin' if I run up to your hoe and whole crew
I'm gonna still let you know girl
That it's all about you, you, you, you
