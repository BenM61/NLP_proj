Summer, it turns me upside down
Summer, summer, summer
It's like a merry go round
I see you under the midnight
All shackles and bows
High shoes with the cleats a clickin'
A tempermental glow

Oh, don't you let me go
Oh, I got a hold on you
I got a hold on you
I got a hold on you tonight
Oh, I got a hold on you
I got a hold on you (I got a hold on you)
I'll check

(Oh oh it's magic) when I'm with you (oh oh it's magic)
(Oh oh it's magic) just a little magic
You know it's true
I gotta hold on you

Oh, twisted under sideways down
I know you're getting twisted
And you can't calm down
I see you under the midnight
Love darts in your eyes
How far can you take it?
'Till you realize
There's magic in your eyes

I got a hold on you
I got a hold on you
I got a hold on you tonight
I got a hold on you
I got a hold on you
(I got a hold on you) yeah, yeah, uh

(Oh oh, it's magic)
Oh oh, when I'm with you
(Oh oh, it's magic) (Oh oh, it's magic)
Just a little bit of the magic
Pulls me through
I got a hold on you

I've got a hold on you
I got a hold on you
(I got a hold on you)
Lets try, it's magic
(Oh oh, it's magic)
Oh oh, it's magic
When I'm with you (oh oh, it's magic)

(Oh oh, it's magic)
Just a little bit of magic inside of you (Oh oh, it's magic)

(Oh oh, it's magic)
Just a little bit of magic
That's true, when I'm with you
(Oh oh, it's magic)
(It gotta be magic)
Your magic pulls me through
Oh oh, it's magic
(Oh oh, it's magic)
