Wet is rain
Rain is clean and new
New is the morning
And morning dew
Wet is a kiss that touches you
Wet is sea
Sea is mysterious blue
Blue is for sadness
And sad is for crying
Tears are wet too
Would you share these things with me

Dance in the rain
Drift with the sea
And let the tears fall as they wade

Sometimes
I'm not afraid of melt in the rain
I'm not afraid to be lost at see
I'm not afraid to cry again

Because it's tears of joy
You bring to me
Would you share these things with me
Dance in the rain
Drift with the sea
And let the tears fall as they wade

Sometimes
Wet is love
Love that's flowing free
Free is the feeling I feel deep inside me
Come and see that wet is me...
