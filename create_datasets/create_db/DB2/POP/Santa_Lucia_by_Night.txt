Catch a falling star and tell me you love me

Say you love me
Tell me you love me.
Hold it in your hand and say that you need me

the words I wanna hear.
Loneliness a road I left far behind me

far behind me
So far behind me
Happiness comes in my life if you want me

so give it all to me.

Do you wanna stay
My love
Do you wanna stay
My love

Underneath the stars above?
Santa Lucia by night -
Romantic feelings under the starry light.
No more worries
No more troubles to care

It's love that we share
It's love that we share.
Santa Lucia by night -
Sail on the wings of love when you hold me tight
There's a place for you and I in this time

If you will be mine
If you will be mine.

Come and sing this happy melody

Sing it with your soul
It makes you free.
Listen to the music of your heart

In the Italian night we can be alright.

Santa Lucia by night -
Romantic feelings under the starry light.
No more worries
No more troubles to care

It's love that we share
It's love that we share.

Catch a falling star and tell me you love me

Do you wanna stay
My love
Do you wanna stay
My love
. . .
Come and sing this happy melody
. . .
Santa Lucia by night -
Romantic feelings under the starry light. . . .
No more worries
No more troubles to care

It's Iove that we share
It's love that we share.
In the morning till the night.
