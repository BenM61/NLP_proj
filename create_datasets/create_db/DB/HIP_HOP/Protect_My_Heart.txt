I gotta protect my heart
I gotta protect my heart

You were the heart of the spot
But you wouldn't tell me your name
You were like
Girl you ready or not
To dance the entire night away
You and I

Let me hold you girl, hold you girl
You were sayin'
Let me touch it girl
You were sayin'
Let me squeeze you girl, squeeze you girl
You taught me up
Let me you girl

So when I first got here I knew already
I gotta protect my heart
Make all changes, new destinations and flip it
I gotta protect my heart

The room is Oh so hot
If you want more than that than walk away
I'm givin' it all I got
And at the same time tryin' to make ten

You were sayin'
Let me hold you girl, hold you girl
You were sayin'
Let me touch it girl
You were sayin'
Let me squeeze you girl, squeeze you girl
You taught me up
Let me you girl

So when I first got here I knew already
I gotta protect my heart
And the you come change things I knew that some would flip it
I gotta protect my heart
Never been touched by the way someone woo's and that scares me
I gotta protect my heart
You even knew that you were comin, you should of prepared me
I gotta protect my heart

I just need ta
I walked away from the door
I could feel myself reversing
I never gave it before
See i guess that how I've been
when you were like

Let me hold you girl, hold you girl
You were sayin'
Let me touch it girl
You were sayin'
Let me squeeze you girl, squeeze you girl
You taught me up
Let me you girl

So when I first got here I knew already
I gotta protect my heart
And the you come change things I knew that some would flip it
I gotta protect my heart
Never been touched by the way someone woo's and that scares me
I gotta protect my heart
You even knew that you were comin', you should of prepared me
I gotta protect my heart

Break It Down

So when I first got here I knew already
I gotta protect my heart
And the you come change things I knew that some would flip it
I gotta protect my heart
I gotta protect my heart
I gotta protect my heart
