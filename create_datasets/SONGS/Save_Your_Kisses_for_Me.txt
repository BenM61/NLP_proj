Though it hurts to go away
It's impossible to stay
But there's one thing
I must say before I go

I love you (I love you)
You know I'll be thinking of you
In most everything I do

Now the time is moving on
And I really should be gone
But you keep me hanging on
For one more smile

I love you (I love you) all the while
With your cute little wave
Will you promise that you'll save

Your kisses for me
Save all your kisses for me
Bye bye, baby, bye bye
Don't cry, honey, don't cry
Gonna walk out the door
But I'll soon be back for more

Kisses for me
Save all your kisses for me
So long, honey, so long
Hang on, baby, hang on
Don't you dare me to stay
'Cause you know I'll have to say

That I've got to work each day
And that's why I go away
But I count the seconds
Till I'm home with you

I love you (I love you) it's true
You're so cute, honey, gee
Won't you save them up for me

Your kisses for me
Save all your kisses for me
Bye bye, baby, bye bye
Don't cry, honey, don't cry
Gonna walk out the door
But I'll soon be back for more

Kisses for me
Save all your kisses for me
So long, honey, so long
Hang on, baby, hang on
Won't you save them for me
Even though you're only three

Kisses for me
Save all your kisses for me
Bye bye, baby, bye, bye
Don't cry, honey, don't cry
Won't you save them for me
Even though you're only three

Kisses for me
Save all your kisses for me
Bye bye, honey, so long
