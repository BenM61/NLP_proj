I gotta make a phone call to my best friends 
I gotta let them know that I'm leaving 
Everything behind me and politely 
I don't want to hurt their feelings 
Oh no, no no 

I'll need to come back and I want to explain 
Why I had to leave them sleeping 
The answer's in the air, but I really don't care 
Cause I couldn't really keep on breathing the smoke 

And every time when I painted my room 
Like a fool I hid my feelings 
And every time when I painted my room 
I thought about leaving 

You roll like a stone girl you should not stop 
And I don't want to step on your feet 
And you do what you do to stay on top 
And I don't want to make you feel incomplete 

And every time when I painted my room 
Like a fool I hid my feelings 
And every time when I painted my room 
I thought about leaving 

At the end of the day 
Don't know what to say 
At the end of the day 
I'll be flying 
Away [flying away] 

And every time when I painted my room 
Like a fool I hid my feelings 
And every time when I painted my room 
I thought about leaving 
Thought about leaving 

And every time when I painted my room 
Like a fool I hid my feelings 
And every time when I painted my room 
Know I thought about leaving 
[thought about leaving] 
Now that I'm leaving
