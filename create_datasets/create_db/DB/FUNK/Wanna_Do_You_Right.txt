My lady my lady listen
I'm been doin' you wrong for so damn long
But now I want to do the right thing for you lady
I can't live like this no more
I've gotta get you back some how some way
Please come home

I've been doin' you wrong girl
For so damn long girl 
Now I'm singin' this song girl
'Cause baby I want to do right

I've been doin' you wrong girl
For so damn long girl 
Now I'm singin' this song girl
'Cause baby I want to do right

Listen
Time goes by we grow apart
But now I've had a change of heart
Please believe me
There's no smile upon my face... no no no no no
'Cause I know the truth is standing right in front of my face

I've been doin' you wrong girl
For so damn long girl 
Now I'm singin' this song girl
'Cause baby I want to do right

No more
No I cannot play
No more
Baby I just can't
No more
Baby I want to be the man that you need
Girl can't you take me back
Baby baby please

If you don't take me back
I'll understand
Yes I will 
Yes I will
It's only my fault 'cause I was not a real man
I'll do the very best I can
Oh yes I will
Raise my hand to god 
I won't
Never love another
I would never cheat again baby

I've been doin' you wrong girl
For so damn long girl 
Now I'm singin' this song girl
'Cause baby I want to do right

I've been doin' you wrong girl
For so damn long girl 
Now I'm singin' this song girl
'Cause baby I want to do right
