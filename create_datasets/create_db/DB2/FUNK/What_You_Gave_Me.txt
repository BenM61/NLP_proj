Like a breath of spring you came
And as you leave, I can only sigh your name
Cries of anguish echo from way down
But will never reach my lips to make a sound

Though it seems my world is crumblin'
Honey, you don't owe me anything

'Cause what you gave me, girl
Is more than enough to last, oh yes it is
And what you gave me, girl
Is more than enough to last, oh yes it is

You've given me so much warmth
I don't see how I could ever grow cold
In my mind, there's a picture of you and I
That nobody has the price to buy

I don't know what made you change your mind
But you'll be back, it's just a matter of time

What you gave me
Is more than enough to last, oh yeah
And what you gave me
Is more than enough to last

Into my life you came like a breath of spring
Givin' me a song to sing, oh yeah, oh yeah
And though I know you're leavin'
I won't be grievin' 'cause I know

Time has a way of showin' us
The things we really need
And no matter where you go
I know you'll find your way back home, oh baby

Though I know it's not reality
You'll always be a part of me

'Cause what you gave me
Is more than enough to last, oh, yeah, yeah
And what you gave me, hey
Is more than enough to last
What you gave me
Is more than enough to last
And what you gave me
Is more than enough to last
