Yeah, yeah

The world is so small, 'til it ain't (yeah)
I'm building up a wall, 'til it break
She hate it when I call, and it's late
I don't wanna keep you waiting
I hope I never keep you waiting (yeah)
I think I know it all, but I don't
Why you always at the mall when you broke, yeah
And I just wanna ball
Maybe dunk but I've never been tall (yeah)
I might trip, I never fall
God know's Icame close (don't try this at home)

I know I probably need to do better
F*ck whoever
Keep my shit together
You never told me being rich was so lonely
Nobody know me, oh well
Hard to complain from this five star hotel
I'm always in a rush, I've been thinking too much but
Keep it on the hush, no one need to know, just us
That's really all it takes
We don't need nothing but today (today, today, today, today)

The world is so small, 'til it ain't
('Til it ain't, 'til it ain't, 'til it ain't)
I'm building up a wall, till it break
('Til it break, 'til it break, 'til it break)
She hate it when I call, and it's it late
(And it's late, and it's late)
I don't wanna keep you waiting (I don't wanna keep you waiting)
I hope I never keep you waiting (I hope I never keep you waiting)

Whoa (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Whoa (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Whoa (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Whoa (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Whoa (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Whoa (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Whoa (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Whoa (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Yeah, got a bad attitude
Playing 'til I'm out of moves
No need for shame, I get more peace at slow speeds
Go beat the game, young control freak
It's cold in my veins, I'm below freezing, snow season (made me)
They know that I so need my space
Don't wanna grow old so I smoke just in case
She say that I glow below the waist
And a stroke is just so PGA

All I got is a little bit of space and time
Drawing shapes and lines of the world we made
Tomorrow may be right around the corner but I swear
It's gon' be worth it if I make it, babe
There's somewhere above, you keep reaching up
That's really all it takes (that's really all it takes)
we don't need nothing but today (today, today, today, today)

The world is so small, 'til it ain't
('Til it ain't, 'til it ain't, 'til it ain't)
I'm building up a wall, till it break
('Til it break, 'til it break, 'til it break)
She hate it when I call, and it's it late
(And it's late, and it's late)
I don't wanna keep you waiting (I don't wanna keep you waiting)
I hope I never keep you waiting (I hope I never keep you waiting)

Yeah, nine times out of ten I get it wrong
That's why I wrote this song, told myself to hold on
I can feel my fingers slippin', in a motherfuckin' instant I'll be gone
Do you want it all if it's all mediocre
Staring at the wall and the wall's full of posters
Lookin' at my dreams, and who I wanna be
I guess you gotta see it to believe
Oh, I been a fool, but that's cool, that's what human beings do
Keep your eyes to the sky, never glued to your shoes
Guess there was a time when my mind was consumed
But the sun's coming out now, clouds start to move
Don't tell me nothing but the truth
I'm tired, I don't gotta spare a second
Win or lose, win or lose
I don't keep count, nobody checkin'
