Circles and cycles and seasons
For everything there's always reason
But it's never good
Never turns out as it should
No one ever held you
No single moment of truth
But if you were mine
I would've looked into those eyes
And you said

Tell me the words
You long to hear
And I'll sing them loud and clear
Let me heal the wounds you've held on to for all these years
Break the cycle
Break the chains
Cause love is louder than all your pain
Than all your pain

Is it all truly broken
You let a few mistakes
Let's take our time
Don't we have to try
Too many missing pieces
That's always been your reason to justify
How you feel alive
I wish you'd take

Tell me the words
You long to hear
And I'll sing them loud and clear
Let me heal the wounds you've held on to for all these years
Break the cycle
Break the chains
Love is louder than all your pain
Break the cycle
Break the chains
Love is louder than all your pain
Than all your pain
