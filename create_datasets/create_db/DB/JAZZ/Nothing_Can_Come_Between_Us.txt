Always hope that you remember
We'll never really learn the meanin' of it all
What we have is strong and tender
So hold on

In the middle of the madness
When the time is runnin' out and you're left alone
All I want is you to know that
It's strong still, can't pull us apart

Nothing can come between us
Nothing can pull us apart
Can come between us

I always hope that you remember
What we have is strong and tender
In the middle of the madness
Hold on

So it truly is a good thing
And I always wanted you to know
There is always this and this is everlastin'
Hold on

It's about faith
It's about trust, yeah yeah
It's about faith
It's about trust

Nothing can come, nothing can come
Nothing can come between us
Nothing can come, nothing can come
Nothing can come between us

Nothing can come, nothing can come
Nothing can come between us
Nothing can come, nothing can come
Nothing can come between us

Nothing can come, nothing can come
Nothing can come between us
Nothing can come, nothing can come
Nothing can come between us

Nothing can come, nothing can come
Nothing can come between us
