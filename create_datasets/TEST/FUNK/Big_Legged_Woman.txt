Big leg woman, what you tryin' to do to me?
Big leg woman, what you tryin' to do to me?
Takin' all my money, honey, leave me nothin' but misery

Breakin' hearts you should be rulin', makin' a play thing out of love
Breakin' hearts you should be rulin', makin' a play thing out of love
I wonder who'll be your next ticket, baby? Thought you the one I'm thinkin' of

I'll swim a river for ya baby, if you take me back again
I'll swim a river for ya baby, if you take me back again
I pay the price or suffer twice, baby, 'cause your heart is just like ice

Really sounds good, man
Playin' that sounds good together!
You know, it's got to sound good, when I pay the price and suffer twice!
If this woman just takes me back again, you know!)
