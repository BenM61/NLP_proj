A steady beat goes 1, 2, 3, 4
A steady heart goes "I love you more"
I know sometimes it's confusing
A steady beat goes 1, 2, 3, 4
A steady heart goes "I love you more"
I know sometimes it's confusing

I'm waiting for you
Tell me that you're here
I'm waiting for you
I won't disappear
I'm falling in and out of love
I'm waiting for you

I won't go, I won't stay
I won't take all the memories
I won't leave any behind
I won't push, I won't pull
Broken love but it's beautiful
Out of rhythm, out of time

A steady beat goes 1, 2, 3, 4
A steady heart goes "I love you more"
I know sometimes it's confusing
A steady beat goes 1, 2, 3, 4
A steady heart goes "I love you more"
I know sometimes it's confusing
My treble heart

My treble heart
A steady beat goes 1, 2, 3, 4
A steady beat goes 1, 2, 3, 4
My treble heart

Yeah, I guess I'm an asshole, get ass in these cities
See rap that's the benefit
I came to your city, you fell in love with me
I smashed for the hell of it
My new chick is everything, your envy is evident
I do not have time to talk 'bout my past and all your stories embellishments
I'll give you an hour or two, the best of your life you can relish in
Running around talking 'bout these accomplishments
Things that you never did, penthouse, the president
Met Mike, it's been history ever since
My writer is whiskey and M&M's
I just popped a pill, I feel limitless

A steady beat goes 1, 2, 3, 4
A steady heart goes "I love you more"
I know sometimes it's confusing
A steady beat goes 1, 2, 3, 4
A steady heart goes "I love you more"
I know sometimes it's confusing
My treble heart

My treble heart
A steady beat goes 1, 2, 3, 4
A steady beat goes 1, 2, 3, 4
My treble heart
A steady beat goes 1, 2, 3, 4
A steady beat goes 1, 2, 3, 4
My treble heart
