All around town
Making me stress
I need to get this off my chest
And if her friend want some then she'll be next
It really ain't that complicated
Ya'll walking 'round looking all frustrated
Want some plates come on let's make it
Actin real hard but I know ya'll fakin'

I wasn't really the one who startin' this
Really don't know why you're talkin' shit
You're about to catch one right in your lip
It's about to be a what, girl fight!

The reason why we comin' is understood

Steppin' your hair's pulled up and your girls outside
Don't be tryna call your cousin on me

Bout to el elbows all in your grain

Oh snap these bitches they act like cats
In the middle of the dance floor now they're preparing to scrap
They're takin' out their scrunchies and they're pullin' off their press-ons
The one on the right is the girlfriend (What)
And the one on the left is the other woman
Someone please call the security these girls too purty
To get down to the nitty titty
I mean the nitty gritty
I mean her titties pretty
I'm trippin' bein' silly willy man
