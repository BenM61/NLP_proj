People pushin' like I don't know 
I'm gonna live my life like I wanted to
My hopes shot down, my backs to the wall
But I've got my pride
They can't take it all

I've got my pride
They can't take that away
You've got your pride
They can't take that away

People pushin' like I don't know 
I'm gonna live my life like I wanted to
My hopes shot down, my backs to the wall
But I've got my pride
They can't take it all

I've got my pride
They can't take that away
I've got my pride
They can't take that away
I'm gonna be free
Gonna be free

Can't take my life away 
They can't take my life away
Take my life away

Can't take my life away
They can't take my life away
Take my life away

Take my life away
Take my life away

Back's to the wall
I'm starting to fall
Make your stand, no man's land
Will nobody give me a helping hand
Put me down, wipe me out
Do what you like but I'll put up a fight
I'm goin' to the wall 
Goin' to the wall
