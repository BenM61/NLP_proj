Did you hear the one about the friend of a a friend who tried to end it all
At the last moment he picked up the phone and gave you a call
You thought about letting it ring, but you answered after all

And there you were, put on the spot at the end of the other line

For questions that you never thought you'd ever have to answer to
Who do you turn to when the ones you always turn to go and turn on you
It leaves you in the dark, feeling for a switch to turn it on again

There are no easy answers, the questions remain tough
There's no shortcuts to easy street, no corners you can cut
Can you cut this diamond in the rough

And it's good to see you alive
Sign your will to survive
A look into your heart before it sees its final hour
Lived each day like there is no tomorrow

Beyond this mess ahead there is a street so very hard to find
Though I have got to lay my head down at this dead end so many times
And if we ever get to easy street, you can say with a smile

I came just for the ride
