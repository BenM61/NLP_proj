Ladies,
1, 2, 3 uh! 

So I put on a little bit o' makeup 
Then put on my sexy clothes, 
Get in my high heels to paint my nails, and there you go 
I know that I seemed to, but I didn't mean to lead you on 
But that ain't no reason for you to believe that you turn me on 

Had me going there, so so good 
But you had to mess it up, 'cause you couldn't get enough 
Just stop pushing me, it's no use 
Just because we get along, Doesn't mean we'll get it on 

So I go Whoopsie Daisy 
I've been driving him crazy 
'cause I look so tasty, but it's no no no 
I go Whoopsie Daisy 
I've been driving him crazy 
Boy you can't be my papa 
So boy go home to your mama 

Yeah, yeah 

I never loved you, now I gotta love you just because 
You buy me a drink and I see what you think 
When you call me up (whatever) 
Now girls be careful when you go out there and strut your stuff 
If it's not like him to take a hint, when it ain't physical, oh 

(Hook 2) 
Had me going there, so so fine 
Are you gonna give it up, Just because you get it up 
Just stop pushing me, its no use 
Just because we get along 
Doesn't mean it's sexual 

So I go Whoopsie Daisy 
I've been driving him crazy 
'cause I look so tasty, but it's no no no 
I go Whoopsie Daisy 
I've been driving him crazy 
Boy you can't be my papa 
So boy go home to your mama 

Gimme your love, gimme your love, gimme your love 
Boy, get down, get down 
Pushing your luck, pushing your luck, pushing your luck 
Go baby, strut your stuff, yeah 
Gimme your love, gimme your love, gimme your love 
Boy, get down, get down, 
Pushing your luck, pushing your luck, pushing your luck 

So I go Whoopsie Daisy

'cause I look so tasty, but it's no no no 
I go Whoopsie Daisy 
I've been driving him crazy 
Boy you can't be my papa
