I've traveled far
The land and the sea
Beautiful places
I happened to be

One little town
I'll never forget
Is Lourdes
The village of St. Bernadette

Ave, ave, ave, Maria
Ave, ave, ave, Maria

There, like a dream
This wonderful night
I gazed at the grotto
Aglow in the light

A feeling divine
Swept over me there
I fell to my knees
As I whispered the prayer

Ave, ave, ave, Maria
Ave, ave, ave, Maria

Now I am home
I'm happy to be
Telling of places
I've traveled to see

One little town
I'll never forget
Is Lourdes
The village of St. Bernadette

Ave, ave, ave, Maria
Ave, ave, ave, Maria

Ave, ave, ave, Maria
Ave, ave, ave, Maria
