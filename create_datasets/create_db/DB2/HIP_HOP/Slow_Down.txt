Holding you in the moonlight, the feeling's so right
I know you've been waiting
Ooh, your eyes say you want me but my heart says
Hold on, we gotta be patient

If it's special enough, baby, why must we rush?
We're gonna be stronger
And I promise to give you my all
No, we won't take too long
But you gotta save your love for me

Slow down so I can love you better
Cherish this moment for life, oh yeah
Slow down, let's just share this dream together
And make this magic last for always

Slow down

The way you touch me so sweet
How can I deny you what I've been missing?
Oh, you know you are
I wanna say that I love you but you want so much more
Than what I've been giving, oh baby

When the feeling is right gonna lean down inside
Boy, if you're willing and I promise
To give you my all, no, we won't take too long
But you gotta save your love for me, yes

Slow it down, down, down so I can love you better
Cherish this moment for life, oh yeah
Slow down, let's just share this dream together
And make the magic last for always

Slow down, slow it down

It will be so easy giving myself to you, yeah
True love is worth waiting for
That's what makes it special
Hold out for a love made in heaven

Slow down, oh yeah

Slow down 'cause I don't wanna rush tonight
Let's take our time and do it right
I wanna give it, all my love to you
Baby, let's just take our time

(Slow down, slow down)
Hold me, love me through the night
(Slow down, slow down)
Oh, ooh baby
