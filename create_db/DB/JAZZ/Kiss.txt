(Kiss, kiss me)
(Hold, hold me)
(Kiss me, hold me, kiss me, hold me...)

Kiss, kiss me
Say you miss, miss me
Kiss me love, with heavenly affection
Hold, hold me close to you
Hold me, see me through
With all your heart's protection

Thrill, thrill me
With your charms
Take me, in your arms
And make my life perfection
Kiss, kiss me darling
Then, kiss me once again
Make my dreams come true

(This is the moment, oh thrill me)
Thrill me, thrill me (with your charms)
Take me, take me (in your arms)
And make my life perfection
Take me, darling don't foresake me
Kiss me
Hold me tight
Love me, love me tonight

(Kiss me, hold me, take me, love me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me)
