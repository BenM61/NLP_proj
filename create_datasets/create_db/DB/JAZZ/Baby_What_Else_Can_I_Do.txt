Life has a crazy pattern
And fortune comes to few
I'd like to take the pattern
And fashion it for you

Though there may be lean while
Darling, in the meanwhile

I'll give you my love
I'm sure that love will see us through
Baby, baby, what else can I do?
If you want the moon
I'll bring the moon right down to you
Baby, baby, what else can I do?

Someday we'll live in a mansion
Out where the pastures are green
But even in a small room
Just a little hall room
You'll be the king
I'll be the queen

So, please, take my heart
Just for a start till dreams come true
Baby, baby, what else can I do?
