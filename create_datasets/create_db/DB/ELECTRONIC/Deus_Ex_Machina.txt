Deus ex machina...
After ten rainy summers
And nine destructive winters
There was hardly nothing left
But a bare and sore ground
Lite a stripped and dried out soul
Without body and skin
And the cold wind blew the hazel trees
And the cold wind blew the hazel trees
Reminding them of how old they are
Suddenly a force from above
Silenced the elegy
It was at the end of the day
It was at the end of the day
Although the beginning of a new and bright tomorrow
Deus ex machina...
After ten rainy summers
And nine destructive winters
There was a last sudden gust of wind
Before the life and freshness again
Touched every heart, mind and soul
And the comfortable summer breeze
Played with the green leaves of the hazel trees
Reminding them of how young
And beautiful they are
Echoing a sorrowless future to come
They thought about their lives
How satisfying they were
And they spoke with happy childlike voices
After ten rainy summers
And nine destructive winters
Deus ex machina...
