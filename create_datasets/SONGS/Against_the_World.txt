They taught him right and what to believe
How to live by the rules
They all restrained his hungry heart,
With time he would conceive

Walked the path of a righteous man
Taught him how to belong
A winding road, and now it seems

No, the world is on my shoulders
I'm the one against the world
The one they led astray
But I'll know till my dying day
I'm the only one against the world

Never stray from our way of life
Vent your anger within
Betrayal, it makes a bitter man
The truth cuts like knives

Now look at him and what he's become
He still kneels for them all
A broken pawn, about to fall

No, the world is on my shoulders
I'm the one against the world
The one they led astray
But I'll know till my dying day
I'm the only one against the world

There he stands alone again
Watch his world become unreal
Forever astray

No, the world is on my shoulders
I'm the one against the world
The one they led astray
But I'll know till my dying day
I'm the only one against the world

Against the world
The world
