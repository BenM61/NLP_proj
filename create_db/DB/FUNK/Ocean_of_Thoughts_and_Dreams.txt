When I'm by myself sometimes,
A million thoughts run cross my mind,
When I try to do without you,
All I do is dream about you,

And my mind,
Just drifts away (hey, hey)
Right into the ocean of thoughts, 
And dreams

(Mmm)

I go by the sea at night,
To watch the moon reflect the night,
(To watch the moon reflect the night)
I see your face in every tide,
This emptiness I cannot hide,

And my mind,
Just drifts away (hey, hey)
Right into the ocean of thoughts, 
And dreams,

Oh, I want to dream on,
Dream on,
Drifting right on away,

Like dust upon a pretty rose,
It hides the beauty of my love,
My love is here but then you're there,
Why did our love had to pass,

Oh, my mind (mind)
Just drifts (drift)
Away (away)
Drifting all away girl
Right into the Ocean of Thoughts and Dreams,

Oh my mind keeps on drifting,
Oh it keeps on drifting away,
And know I do is keep dreaming of you,

And know,
I'm down by the ocean,
And I see your face in every tide,
I keep hoping and hoping,
Oh I wish you,
I wish we can do it again
