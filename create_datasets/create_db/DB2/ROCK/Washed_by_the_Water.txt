Daddy was a preacher
She was his wife
Just trying to make the world a little better
You know, shine a light

People started talking
Just to hear their own voice
Those people tried to accuse my father
Said he made the wrong choice

Though it might be painful
You know that time will always tell
Those people have long since gone
My father never failed

Even when the rain falls
Even when the flood starts rising
'Cause even when the storm comes
I am washed by the water

Even when the rain falls
Even when the flood starts rising
'Cause even when the storm comes
I am washed by the water

Even if the Earth crumbles under my feet
Even if the ones I love turn around and crucify me
I won't never ever let you down
I won't fall
I won't fall
I won't fall as long as you're around me

Even when the rain falls
Even when the flood starts rising
'Cause even when the storm comes
I am washed by the water

Even when the rain falls
Even when the flood starts rising
'Cause even when the storm comes
I am washed by the water

Even when the rain falls
Even when the flood starts rising
'Cause even when the storm comes
I am washed by the water

Even when the rain falls
Even when the flood starts rising
'Cause even when the storm comes
I am washed by the water
