Too many broken promises
Too many Trail of Tears
Too many times you were left cold
For oh so many years

Too many times you walked away
And was made to feel ashamed
And though you only tried to give
You were often blamed

How can this world be so dark
So unfair and so untrue
How did the cards of life
Fold right on top of you

God in Heaven, hear my prayer
If you are still above
Send the children hopes and dreams
And lots and lots of love
For this I only ask of you
To conquer all their fears
And let them soar like eagles
Across the Trail of Tears
