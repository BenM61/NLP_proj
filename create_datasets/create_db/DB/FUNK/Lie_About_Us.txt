Ooh oy,
Yeah yeah

Baby I know
When we started out there were things you didn't know
But babygirl
We got a lotta things we need to discuss
I know I'm asking for a lot but just trust
You say that things getting old
Sneakin', round creepin' and love on the low
Now babygirl
I can't wait till' it's officially us
I can't wait let them know about us

First I thought that I could take you boy but I don't know (I don't know)
You told me you were gonna leave her for me long ago (long ago)

Eventually I will but I just gotta take it slow
Don't wanna break her heart, although I gotta let her go so baby

So please don't say you wanna give up.
How do I tell her that I'm fallen in love,
And I know your waiting patiently for that day,
When we no longer have to lie about us.
When I'm with her all I want is your touch,
And when you call me I don't wanna hang up,
And I know I say it often but I can't wait
Till' we no longer have to lie about us.

Baby I know the situation don't seem fair to us both
But babygirl, she's an issue that I'm bout to adjust
Don't mistake the love we make for just lust,
You are my soul, mind, body, spirit all that I know.
But babygirl I can't wait till' it's officially us
I can't wait to tell the world about us.
