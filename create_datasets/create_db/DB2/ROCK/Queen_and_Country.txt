The wind is on the river and the tide has turned too late,
So we're sailing for another shore where some other ladies wait.
To throw us silken whispers: catch us by the anchor chains,
But we all laugh so politely and we sail on just the same

For Queen and Country in the long dying day,
And it's been this way for five long years, since we signed our souls away.
We bring back gold and ivory; rings of diamonds; strings of pearls 
Make presents to the government so they can have their social whirl

With Queen and Country in the long dying day.
And it's been this way for five long years since we signed our souls away.
They build schools and they build factories, with the spoils of battles won.
And we remain their pretty sailor boys, hold our heads up to the gun.

Of Queen and Country in the long dying day.
And it's been this way for five long years since we signed our souls away.
To Queen and Country in the long dying day.
And it's been this way for five long years since we signed our souls away.
