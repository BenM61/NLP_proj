Do you, do you, do you?
Yes, I do
Do you, do you, do you?
Yes, I do

Do you feel it?
Do you feel sexy body eruptions?
Do you want it?
Do you feel it deep inside?

So you say you wanna lose control
Well, demolition's coming back in vogue
You can grab it, you can bring it to the city
And be the architect of negativity

So come on
Mayhem's knocking on your front door
So come on
Brass knuckles and a two-by-four
I wanna know

Oh, do you, do you dig destruction?
Latino lovers often do
And are you crazy about corruption?
Look in your soul and say it's cool

Are you sick, are you sick of deconstruction?
Summer's here and the time is right to vandalize
You can take it to the United Nations
Start a riot on the local rock station
Hey, you're not alone
Pick up a stone, live a life of crime

So come on
War is knocking on your front door
So come on
Brass knuckles and a two-by-four
I wanna know

Oh, do you, do you dig destruction?
Latino lovers often do
And are you crazy about corruption?
Look in your soul and say it's cool

You know that it's cool
Know that it's cool
Know that it's true

Crazy, I'm crazy like a fool
Crazy, so what are you gonna do about destruction?
Crazy, I'm crazy like a fool
Crazy, so what are you gonna do?
