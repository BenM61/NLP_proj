For you, I'd give a life time of stability
Anything you want of me
Nothing is impossible 
For you, tThere are no words or ways to show my love
Or all the thoughts I'm thinking of
'Cause this life is no good alone 
Since we've become one, I made a change
Everything I do now makes sense
All roads end
All I do is for you

For you, I share the cup of love that overflows
And anyone who knows us knows
I would change all thoughts I have 
For you, there is no low or high or in between
Of my heart that you haven't seen
'Cause I share all I have and am
Nothing I've said is hard to understand
All I feel I feel deeper still
And always will
All this love is for you

Every note that I play
Every word I might say
Every melody I feel are only for you and your appeal
Every page that I write
Every day of my life
Would not be filled without the things
That my love for you now brings

For you, I make a promise of fidelity
Now and for eternity
No one could replace this love
For you, I take your hand and heart and everything
And add to them a wedding ring
'Cause this life is no good alone
Since we've become one you're all I know
If this feeling should leave I'd die
And here's why all I am is for you

Everything I do now makes sense
All roads end
All I do is for you
Only for you
