Look out your window any day
From June to September the love parade's
Out on the street where you live and you know
It's just a matter of time before it takes over

They've been married for so many years
Now a young love seranade blows sweet nothing in her ear
They're lonely together, when they're not apart
It feels like she's holding on to someone else in the dark.

Oh the love parade is on
Even against all odds
It'll go on forever
The love parade
Only matinee shows
The love parade.

But if he could put himself into a different skin
He'd be worrying about what he's let himself in for
Hanging in the air apparent
A point of view almost transparent

So you sold your soul for a pocket full of sweet talk
Forget-me-not kisses at the end of a slow walk
And when it's done you put your world back on
'Cause she's otherwise engaged married to someone

Oh the love parade goes on
Even when you're gone
It'll go on forever
The love parade
Only matinee shows
The love parade.
