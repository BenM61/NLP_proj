Deep deep within you
In a secret place
Deep deep within you
Everything you want to know lies
You're just killing time
Don't matter what you found
Doesn't break out your mind
Running around in space
Running through the wind
In a special place
Standing in the middle

Deep deep within you
Deep deep within you
Deep deep within you

There's a strange wind blowing through us all
There's a strange wind blowing through us now
