Roll on thunder shine on lightnin' the days are long and the nights are frightnin'
Nothing matters anyway and that's the hell of it
Winter comes and the winds blow colder well some grew wiser you just grew older
And you never listened anyway and that's the hell of it

Good for nothin' bad in bed nobody likes you and you're better off dead goodbye
We've all come to say goodbye goodbye
Born defeated died in vain
Super destruction you were hooked on pain and tho' your music lingers on
All of us are glad you're gone
If I could live my life half as worthlessly as you
I'm convinced that I'd wind up burning too

Love yourself as you love no other be no man's fool be no man's brother
We're all born to die alone y'know that's the hell of it
Life's a game where they're bound to beat you and time's a trick they can turn to cheat you
And we only waste it anyway and that's the hell of it

Good for nothin' bad in bed nobody likes you and you're better off dead goodbye
We've all come to say goodbye
Born defeated died in vain
Super destruction you were hooked on pain and tho' your music lingers on
All of us are glad you're gone
