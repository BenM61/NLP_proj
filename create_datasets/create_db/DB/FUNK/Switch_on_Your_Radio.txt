Every time I think about the good times, wanna sing and shout
I am the melody, I walk the city wild and free
Just Keep on getting down, groovin' to the beat around
My name is "Sam the Jam", let me take you by the hand
With every step, let's touch the beat
With the streets alive, the rhythm takes your feet

Breakout
We're coming out
Switch on your radio
Let's break out
We're stepping out
Switch on your radio

There ain't no limit girl, you hear my voice around the world
You'll learn to know my name, dancing on the hot airwaves
Come on and listen to, listen to the groove in you
I'll make your body talk, jamming all your fears away
It's time to let the thunder roll
When lighting strikes, it'll surely light your soul

Breakout
We're coming out
Switch on your radio
Let's break out
We're steppin' out
Switch on your radio

Turn on to life, celebrate and and come alive
For your heart can't wait, let the music lead the way
Her's a groove, good to you
Let you body talk, let's jam!
