Magpie, stealing the lashes you no longer need
Away, away, goodbye, goodbye
Raven, fleeing the tower that will never fall
Away, away, so far to fly
Eagle, watching them scurry from a mile afar
Away, away, goodbye, goodbye
Robin, blushing in spite of all the modesty
We cannot find a way to fly

So the dowager plays by herself
So the dowager plans her escape
So the dowager takes to the sky
So the dowager plays by herself
So the dowager plans her escape
So the dowager takes to the sky
So the dowager

Magpie, stealing the lashes you no longer need
Away, away, goodbye, goodbye
Raven, fleeing the tower that will never fall
Away, away, so far to fly
Eagle, watching them scurry from a mile high
Away, away, goodbye, goodbye
Robin, blushing in spite of all the modesty
We cannot find a way to fly

So the dowager plays by herself
So the dowager plans her escape
So the dowager takes to the sky
So the dowager plays by herself
So the dowager plans her escape
So the dowager takes to the sky

Away, away, too far
