I've follow complications like a bloodhound
So pick me up, twist me round
And throw me all the way back down

'Cause I found my feet connected to the ceiling
And hanging upside down, a smile's a frown
It's all too easy on the ground

So, jump in my car, we'll go a hundred round the bends
We'll take this road until we're back and start it again
Jump in my car, we'll go a hundred round the bends
And we'll pretend, feeling rage is feeling real
Feeling rage is feeling real

So, I've got a brand new rubber band for you, boy
Go on give it a stretch
I can see your itching too, frustrations on the boil

But then I see my damn reflection in your eyeball
And I want nothing more to do
With all the things you made me think I am

So, jump in my car, we'll go a hundred round the bends
We'll take this road until we're back and start it again
Jump in my car, we'll go a hundred round the bends
And we'll pretend, feeling rage is feeling real
Feeling rage is feeling real

You were everything for a little while
But I broke it, I broke it, I broke it, I broke it, didn't I
Oh, you were everything for a little while
But I broke it, I broke it, I broke it, I broke it, didn't I
Oh, didn't I, ohh

So, jump in my car, we'll go a hundred round the bends
We'll take this road until we're back and start it again, oh
Jump in my car, we'll go a hundred round the bends
And we'll pretend, feeling rage is feeling real
Feeling rage is feeling real, feeling rage ain't feeling real
