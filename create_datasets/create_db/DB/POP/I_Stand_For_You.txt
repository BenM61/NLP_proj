No greater power, no greater gift to lose
Then the message unspoken, the silence of the truth
Alone we hide in the shadows
But together we bring on the light

One voice is not strong enough
One heart just won't do
In this world, I don't count for much
Unless I stand for you

Oh, we are the beginning of a sound that might be heard
To the many who lie waiting
Our words break through the cold grip of silence
And they guide us through the night

One voice is not strong enough
One heart just won't do
In this world, I don't count for much
Unless I stand for you

One choice is all we got
One fact remains true
In this world, I don't count for much
Unless I stand for you

Not another minute, not another hour
We're gonna rise on up every man, woman and child
(I believe that the time has come)
Oh, I stand for you, alone we hide in the shadows
But together we bring on the light
