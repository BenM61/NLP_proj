Let me tell you where I'm gonna be (Let me tell you)
Cause I don't know if you are gonna see
Let me tell you what I'm gonna show (Let me tell you)
Cause I don't know if you are gonna know
Let me tell you how it's gonna end (Let me tell you)
Cause I don't know if we will still be friends
Let me tell you what I'm gonna do (Let me tell you)
Cause I don't know if you will still be you

We take a chance
A lifelong tribulation
Break away from human nature
I forget myself, forget my limitations
Be with me, be my conversation

And when it started
It started in time
It started right
Still on my mind

I'm feeling so good, but just can't explain
You make my heart feel like, like it's my brain

S-T-A-R-T-E-D
R-I-G-H-T

Let me tell you what I'm gonna be
Cause I don't know if you are gonna see
Let me tell you what I am gonna do
Cause I don't know if you will still be you

We take a chance
A lifelong tribulation
Break away from human nature
I forget myself, forget my limitations
Be with me, be my conversation

And when it started
It started in time
It started right
Still on my mind

I'm feeling so good, but just can't explain
You make my heart feel like, like it's my brain
