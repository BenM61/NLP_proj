A butterfly flies through the forest rain
And turns the wind to the hurricane
I know that it will happen
'Cause I believe in the certainty of chance

A schoolboy yawns, sits back and hits return
While round the world computers crash and burn
I know that it will happen
'Cause I believe in the certainty of chance

And I believe
I can see it all so clearly now

You must go and I must set you free
'Cause only that will bring you back to me
I know that it will happen
I'm sure that it must happen
Oh I know that it's gonna happen
Because I believe in the certainty of chance
