You say what you want to say
Your diamonds are drops of rain
Your smile is your credit card
And your currency is your love.

And the morning is for you
And the air is free
And the birds sing for you
And your positivity.

You play where you want to play
On the main streets where the creeps all prey
And you can feel like you're in dynasty
You could be what you want to be.

And the morning is for you
And the air is free
And the birds sing for you 
And your positivity.

And the cars crash for you
And the sunshine is free
And the sirens call you.

Yes, the morning is for you
Yes, the air is free
Yes, the world spins for you
And your positivity.
Positivity.
