Compound fracture gonna ring the gong
And sound a warning of what's to come
If we ain't careful as to where we step
Paradise calling or untimely death

Compound fracture gotta set the bone
Wrap it up let it heal on it's own
Don't walk on it, give it time to rest

There's no evil, there's no good
Only people doing as they should
There is life in love and sound
Get as much as you can keep around
Before they put you into the ground

For who knows how long (Paradise calling)
How long (Paradise calling)

I know you're young, that's the time to learn
If we're too soft on you, you will get burned
Fill your skull with what you want

There's no evil, there's no good
Only people doing as they should
Or as they shouldn't in the light of day
"God" and "The Devil" were made up anyway
But their meanings so real and so plain
There is life in love and sound
Get as much as you can keep around
Before they put you into the ground

For who knows how long (Paradise calling)
How long (Paradise calling)

For who knows how long (Paradise calling)
How long (Paradise calling)

Till the next go round and around
Till the next go round

Compound fracture gonna ring the gong
And sound a warning of what's to come
If we ain't careful as to where we step
Paradise calling or untimely death
