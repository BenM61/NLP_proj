Throw your heart to me
Let it fall and hit the ground
Let it go
Your timing was so wrong
And I just want to be found

And oh
And I

Yeah, I've got the lines, I've got the lines

Oh it's brighter this time
This type of mine this disguise
Oh you talk, oh, to me

Well, nothing's gonna hurt me with my eyes shut
I can see through them
I can see through them
I am drawing pictures I'm evading
I will not use them
I will not use them
Again

And it starts again
You come over with your friends
I don't wanna talk to them
And all I really want
Is to start again

And oh
And I

Yeah, I've got the lines I've got the lines

Oh it's brighter this time
This type of mine
This disguise
Oh you talk, ooh, to me

Well, nothing's gonna hurt me with my eyes shut
I can see through them
I can see through them
I am drawing pictures I'm evading
I will not use them
I will not use them

'Cause I wanna be bigger than life
For you
For you

'Cause I wanna be bigger than life
For you
For you

And nothing's gonna hurt me with my eyes shut
I can see through them
I can see through them
And I am drawing pictures I'm evading
I will not use them
I will not use them

No, nothing's gonna hurt me with my eyes shut
I can see through them
I can see through them
