Well, every day I work
Bringing home my pay
Come to find out baby
You've been giving my money away

Tell me baby
What you trying to do?
You ain't seen me humming
Like you used to do

Tell me mama
What's wrong with you?
You know pretty baby
I'm so crazy 'bout you

All you pretty women
Bring it to my home
You don't have to worry
I won't do you no wrong

Bring it on home
Bring it to Jerome
Bring it on home
Bring it to Jerome

Look here pretty baby
This mess I won't stand
All the other women
Say you got another man

Bring it on home
Bring it to Jerome
Bring it on home
Bring it to Jerome
