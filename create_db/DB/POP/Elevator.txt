Laughing at their situation, backs against the wall
Waiting for their celebration, waiting for the call
Ride up to the tenth floor where the mannequins are high
Taking their erection with your eye.

Ride, my elevator
Don't say no, my escalator, ride
Ride, my elevator
Come with me, my oscillator
Ride, my elevator, ride.

Making out your every movement, taking in your mind
Taking in their animation, eyes that were so blind
Time has passed so slow, now the mannequins are free
Take a look around, what do you see ?

Ride, my elevator
Don't say no, my escalator, ride
Ride, my elevator
Come with me, my oscillator
Ride, my elevator, ride.

Ride, my elevator
Don't say no, my escalator, ride
Ride, my elevator
Come with me, my oscillator
Ride, my elevator, ride.

Ride, my elevator
Don't say no, my escalator, ride
Ride, my elevator
Come with me, my oscillator
Ride, my elevator, ride.

Ride, ride, elevator, ride
Ride, ride, elevator, ride
Ride, ride, elevator, ride
Ride, ride, elevator, ride
