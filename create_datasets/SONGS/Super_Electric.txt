Super electric sound
(Super electric)
From the underground
(Super electric)
Super electric songs
(Super electric)
Blasting through your ears

As we break it down
To the nitty gritty groove
The bits and the beats
An electric boogaloo
Yes it is rocking
The loop is always cool
It never went away
Just check out my moves

Access from the very best
On the decks yet
The wonder boys gonna
Get you more erect
Access from the very best

The wonder boys gonna
Get you more erect

The wonder boys gonna
Get you more erect

We grew up from the sounds
Our ghetto blaster was huge
We're from the underground
Of the city and the loose
We're the baddest mistakes
You meeting out there and cool
Banging and scheming
Trying to trash school

Access from the very best
On the decks yet
The wonder boys gonna
Get you more erect
Access from the very best
On the decks yet
The wonder boys gonna
Get you more erect
Access from the very best
On the decks yet
The wonder boys gonna
Get you more erect
Access from the very best
On the decks yet
The wonder boys gonna
Get you more erect

Be brave get down

All those classic breaks
Are still used today
DJs spin the wheel
Go rock a party
Hype it up, wipe it out
Stop hold and play
Calling all who share breaks
Come right this way
