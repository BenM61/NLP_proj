The second album full of same old songs 
Fighting back against a system which is cruel and wrong 
Yet another battering ram against a wall of power 
A blasphemous attack to blow the leader?s cover 
It's a message from those who won't take no more 

Of seeing the privileged profit from the poor 
Of the scientist?s piss they call research 
Of being told we?re scum and should be birched 
Well bollocks to them all, keep smashing at the wall 

Pile the pressure on and Government will fall 
But it takes more than music and more than words 
To recreate a nation that's controlled by hoards 
Of police, army and f*ck knows what else 

That they've got waiting for the backlash from the people who care 
To question their control, their dividing lines 
Power must be tested, it's testing time 
Power must be tested, we've heard that time and time again 

But no matter how much pain and protest, nothing seems to change 
The Government show forces and our movement cowers in fear 
Some still strive for freedom, while others simply sneer 
It's the same old racket with the same old songs 

Well it's the same fucking system and it still stands strong 
The battle continues so bollocks to them 
Who mock our anarchy then bow their heads again 
You try working for something that a system can't make 

Creating something that a law can't take 
Back as a loss of privilege for stepping out of line 
Power ain't been tested, so now's the time to f*ck them up again
