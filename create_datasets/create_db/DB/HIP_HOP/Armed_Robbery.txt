Now I was clicking out my barrel just to see if it was loaded 
checking out it's bullets just to make sure it won't explode this 
hand around of the handle of my snub  no skill 
I must be for real in the procedure for a kill 
stood around the corner while I cased out the bank 
busted in the door and stuck the guard wit' a shank 
ran up to the counter pull the gun out wit' the quickness 
shot the bank teller so it wouldn't be a witness 
fled out the door with the money in my left hand 
still in my right hand running like a wild man 
ran to the hide-a-way knowing they was after me 
burned out my id stole a jeep Cherokee 
couldn't be late for my trip to Jamaica 
heading to the river skeeming up on how to take a 
boat from a victim, rush right up and stick him 
with a sharp object making sure that I get him 
put it to the river, see, nervous as a lunatic 
jumped out of the veichle as borrowed me a boat quick 
jumped on with the gun, soughter on the break and run 
shot with the gat, in the back, like in Vietnam 
quickly making waves in the river as I ran fast 
got a mile in the boat ran out of gas 
oh no Joe! the cops can't get me... 
I'll never be wanted for armed robbery

On the other side of town 
moving quickly rolling swiftly in da hoopty ride 
loading up the nine cause there just my be a homicide 
MJG know the plan so the shit is on 
by the time 5-0 come we'll be through and gone 
got to the area, stop then took a glance 
puttin' on the ski mask, stuffing the gat in my pants 
where I saw the right on time, now it's time for the crime 
do the crime waste no time then I'm going to get mine 
waited for the door to open shot the first trick I saw 
then shot the other fool I ain't thinking 'bout no law 
jumped in the truck put the pedal to the medal 
then fired up a square man doing about 1-10 
looking in my rear-view 5-0 everywhere 
messing up my plans with them helicopters in the air 
headed for the airport, wait I see a road block 
hit the gas even harder fool I ain't gonna stop 
crash through the road block they ain't gonna get me yet 
J-Smooth waiting at the airport with a private jet 
jumped out of the truck with fast P's right behind my ass 
running trying to shoot my nine holding bags full of cash 
jumped on the jet now we set to hit the runway 
took to the air yea I got away scott-free 
fired up a Mac j P's didn't catch me 
countin all my money from a strong armed robbery... 

(MJG) 
You thank it's over but it ain't 
cause I can't get caught by authority 
the camera at the bank got me ganked so they know it's me 
reached for artillery, put the shank in my mouth 
dove off the boat to the river and I bailed out 
swam like a fish greeted land with a kiss 
did I hit or did I miss well it goes like this 
I put the money in the spot 
took the clothes that I got 
tied them up in the bag same place I put the mask 
changed clothes in between spots 
hands, spot-see 
the designated area we call spot-be	 
see I can't be broke so I come up with a plan 
the man, money soon in they hand 
get over get up and jet 
bounce the set 
the longer you stay the quicker you get arrested 
MJG testing his strategy.. 
wit' a slick armed robbery 

(Eightball) 
Flying through the air on my way to Jamaica 
thinking about why I took the money for the faka 
me living poor and wishing to be richer 
and me like Picasso I had to paint a picture 
of people dying rapidly, trying to imprison me 
just because I took a little money in a robbery 
landed in Jamaica chilling with the dreads 
smoking on the gunja messing with my head 
the feds came behind me hit me with a billy club 
I fell to the ground, turned around pumping slugs 
jumped up quick, ditched the gun as I ran away 
ran to the hills where I hid for a few days 
no, I'm not the one that they will catch soon 
bought me a palace in the hills wit' a hundred rooms 
I got the money, got the women, got the be	-you-D 
I plead guilty to armed robbery!
