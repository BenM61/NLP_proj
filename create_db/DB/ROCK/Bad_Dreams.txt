Worried I'm getting older, that my fangs have grown too long
Worried I lost my car keys or that I said something wrong
Worried about the mess that's in my house, that's in my heart
Worried that I'll go crazy every time that we're apart

Pessimistic as it seems, sleep will never come that easy
We will always have bad dreams
we will always have bad dreams
We will always have bad dreams

Falling in love and getting over it too soon and oh too fast
I envy the futures of all my friends, I get jealous about your past
If it gets too close, if it gets too much I'm scared I'll disappear
Well babe, I might step back or go too far but I'll wait for you right here

Pessimistic as it seems, sleep will never come that easy
We will always have bad dreams
we will always have bad dreams
We will always have bad dreams

We will always have bad dreams
we will always have bad dreams
We will always have bad dreams
we will always have bad

Pessimistic as it seems, sleep will never come that easy
We will always have bad dreams
we will always have bad dreams
Pessimistic as it seems, sleep will never come that easy
We will always have bad dreams
we will always have bad dreams
