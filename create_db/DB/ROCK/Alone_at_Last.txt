Alone at last, you and I
Together locked in a sigh
The musics soft, lights are low
The mood is one all lovers know
Oh, my darling at last we are one
The trip to heaven's begun
I kiss your fingertips, your eyes, your lips
Oh what exciting moments we share when we're
All alone at last

Oh, my darling, at last we are one
The trip to heaven's begun
I kiss your fingertips, your eyes, your lips
Oh what exciting moments we share when we're
All alone
At last
