Lorelei
Maybe you like a little melody
It's not the words that move me
Lorelei Lorelei Lorelei
Maybe you like a lullaby
Now I can't remember why

Lorelei Lorelei Lorelei
Intuition's leading us where
I don't know yet
Lorelei Lorelei
Something's happening
Hard to place it, hard to hide it

Lorelei Lorelei
What is happening
I'm not sure, I guess you know it
Lorelei Lorelei

Deep in the jungle of thought
There comes a clearing
And in the clearing
There is a pool

The pool is deep
The water cool
This is the thought
The thought is you

Lorelei Lorelei Lorelei Lorelei
Lorelei Lorelei Lorelei Lorelei

Lorelei Lorelei Lorelei Lorelei
Lorelei Lorelei Lorelei Lorelei
Intuition's leading us where
I don't know yet
Lorelei Lorelei
Something's happening
Hard to place it, hard to hide it

Lorelei Lorelei
What is happening
I'm not sure, I guess you know it
Lorelei Lorelei

Lorelei
Lorelei
Lorelei
Lorelei

Across the wasted plain
Across the twisted dunes
Beyond the colored lights
The mountain looms

The air is thin
The door within
The sea of light
The light is you

Lorelei Lorelei Lorelei Lorelei
