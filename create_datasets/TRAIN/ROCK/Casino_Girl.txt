I can see through all your see through clothes
I've got to see you cause I like you loads
I need you, roll you dice and look at me
Casino Girl and me is my fantasy
I need to see you cause you look so good
I've got to touch you cause you said I could
You've got to listen to me
Casino Girl and me
I know you know that you don't know where I've been
If I can't see you I know I won't win
I like you, roll your dice and look at me
Casino Girl and me is my fantasy
The world revolves round me
The world revolves round me
The world revolves round me
The world will stop for me
