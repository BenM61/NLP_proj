Tonight we fight
Until the bloody end
Until the enemy submits
This life we live
To feed our war machine
The souls of a nation burning down

Failure is never an option
As long as we stand
As long as we've got something left to fight for
And we won't stop until there's no more opposition
Something left to fight for
And we won't stop until there's no more, no more

This cause is just
We no hold the key
To a new beginning
Make your mark
The oppression that we face
Is what we fight to be erased

Failure is never an option
As long as we stand
As long as we've got something left to fight for
And we won't stop until there's no more opposition
Something left to fight for
And we won't stop until there's no more, no more

Something left to fight for
And we won't stop until there's no more opposition
Something left to fight for
And we won't stop until there's no more opposition
Something left to fight for
Something left to fight for
Something left to fight for
And we won't stop until there's no more opposition
