I feel like a want to be inside of you 
When the sun goes down 
As long as I'm gonna be around you 
When the sun goes down, yeah 

Oh, my heart 
Takin' me back to blue 
I've fallen into my own senses 
Another night, another day 
It's better this way 
Let the music play 

Oh, my heart 
Only you can know how I feel 
Every day is an ordeal to get by 
Melancholy, ever so 
Broken skin 
Mercury rising 

I feel like a want to be inside of you 
When the sun goes down 
I feel like a want to be inside of you 
When the sun goes down, yeah 

Oh, my heart 
There's movement across the tracks 
Hoping to played it back, all right 
Lucky me, lucky you 
They're givin' us a two minute warning 

Oh, my heart 
Changing the way I kill 
By changing the way I feel 
Step forward 
Everybody, around the world understands 
What makes a child of man (yes, come) 

I feel like a want to be inside of you 
When the sun goes down 
I feel like a want to be inside of you 
When the sun goes down, yeah 

I feel like a want to be inside of you 
When the sun goes down 
As long as I'm gonna be around you 
When the sun goes down, yeah 

Feel like I want to be you more than I 
Get around, come around 
See you every night, hear the crowd the sound of violence 
Shake it out 

I feel like a want to be inside of you 
Ready now 
Going to let it all out 
Ready now 
When the sun goes down 
We'll be coming out ready or not 
Going to let it all out 
When the sun goes down 

Ready now 
Going to let it all out 
Ready now 
When the sun goes down 
We'll be coming out ready or not 
Going to let it all out 
When the sun goes down

Ready now 
Going to let it all out 
Ready now 
When the sun goes down 
We'll be coming out ready or not 
Going to let it all out 
When the sun goes down
