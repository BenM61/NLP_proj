Trust me, really believe
That I can care for all your needs

It's all about you and me

Let's do it, it's all right
The feeling is everything
It's precious, so delicate
Don't be shy

Move your thing, I just want to see you
Dance and touch your body, it's interesting
The way you make it come alive
When you be doing it

And show you all the lovely things
