You've been on my mind
And I know it's bad timing
To say anything I feel
And it's probably surprising, oh yeah

It's been too long and I heard that you moved on
But I just need to let you know
I pushed you away when your heart was right here
And now it's haunting me

I've been meaning to tell you
Oh na na na na
I've been meaning to tell you, oh
but now you're gone

I know that she loves you
But I know that you know that
And now you're gone
Now you're gone
I know that she loves you
But I had these feelings for you all along
Now you're gone

Been wanting to tell you
But it was too easy to live in a lie
I thought that I brought it out
'Til the train finally tipped on its side
That's when I knew I couldn't hide
That's when the trouble arrived
Thanking the bitter reminder
That you're no longer mine

It's been too long and I heard that you moved on
But I just need to let you know
I pushed you away when your heart was right here
And now it's haunting me

I've been meaning to tell you
Oh na na na na
I've been meaning to tell you, oh
but now you're gone

I know that she loves you
But I know that you know that
And now you're gone
Now you're gone
I know that she loves you
But I had these feelings for you all along
Now you're gone

It's been too long and I heard that you moved on
But I just need to let you know
I pushed you away when your heart was right here
And now it's haunting me

I've been meaning to tell you
Oh na na na na
I've been meaning to tell you, oh
but now you're gone

I know that she loves you
But I know that you know that
And now you're gone
Now you're gone
I know that she loves you
But I had these feelings for you all along
Now you're gone
