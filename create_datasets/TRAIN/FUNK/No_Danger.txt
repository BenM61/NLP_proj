When it's all love, there's no danger
There's nothing to be cautious or afraid of
Bring back the love and save us
So we can be one with no danger

Above of my feet and out of my head
I'm groovin in time with lovin' to spread
My heart is calling for no war
Just say you believe then let it unfold

So let the rhythm get into ya
And feel the passion as it moves ya (oh no no)

When it's all love, there's no danger
Nothing to be cautious or afraid of

Bring back the love and save us
So we can be one with no danger

Our worries still lead along with regrets
Feel no more, get the stress off your chest, yea
The pain and suffering are all gone
Cause sure 'nuff indeed
There's heaven in store

So let the rhythm get into ya
And feel the passion as it moves ya (oh no no)

When it's all love, there's no danger
Nothing to be cautious or afraid of

Mmmm mmm mmm, yeah
Mmmm mmm mmm, yeah (Mmmhmm Mmmhmm)
Yeah, yeah ee yeah ee yeah

So let the rhythm get into ya
And feel the passion as it moves ya (oh no no)

When it's all love, there's no danger
Nothing to be cautious or afraid of
