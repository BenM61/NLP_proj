One day when I came home at lunch time
I heard a funny noise
Went out to the backyard to find out
If it was one of those rowdy boys
Stood there with my neighbor called Peter
And a flux capacitor
He told me he built a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen yeah
He said

I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine
Doing fine

He took me to the future in the flux thing
And I saw everything
Boy bands, and another one, and another one
And another one
And girls there with round hair like Star Wars
Float above the floor

We drove around in the time machine
Like one in a film I've seen yeah
He said

I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine
Doing fine

I took a trip to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album
It had outsold Kelly Clarkson
I took a trip to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album

He told me he built a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen yeah

I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine
Doing fine

I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine
Doing fine

I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine
Doing fine

I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine
Doing fine
