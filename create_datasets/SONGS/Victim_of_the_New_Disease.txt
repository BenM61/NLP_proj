Showdown losing ground
They'll drag you when you're not around
Lip service to human rights
Faceless, arrogant
This lie is not an argument
So don't go down without a fight

They've been wrong all along
So please start thinking for yourself
Don't let them cross that line
They're not your fucking friends

Breakthrough don't construe
'Cause liberals get the bullet too
They add one more to the pile
Instigate, dominate
The end will simply immolate
The whole world thrown to the fire

They've been wrong all along
So please start thinking for yourself
Don't let them cross that line
They're not your fucking friends

On your knees it guarantees
A victim of the new disease
The same old one as before
Spread fear commandeer
You see their tactics crystal clear
They shove your back to the wall

They've been wrong all along
So please start thinking for yourself
Don't let them cross that line

They've been wrong all along
So please start thinking for yourself
Don't let them cross that line
They're not your fucking friends
