Your arms don't go around me, when I reach out for you
And your eyes don't hold the fire, that they once used to do
Little signs of distance, (little signs of distance)
Little signs of distance, (little signs of distance)
Tell me, we are through, 
Little signs of distance, (little signs of distance)
Little signs of distance, (little signs of distance)
Tell me, I'm losing you

And it feels I can't go on, am I just no longer strong
Oh it feels, I can't go on, am I losing you (am I losing you)
Am I losing you, ooo

My kisses and cries of love, no longer warm your heart
And I can't seem to find a way baby,
To make your laughter start, oh, 
Little signs of distance, (little signs of distance)
Little signs of distance, (little signs of distance)
Tell me, we are through, 
Little signs of distance, (little signs of distance)
Little signs of distance, (little signs of distance)
Tell me, I'm losing you

And it feels I can't go on, am I just no longer strong
Oh it feels I can't go on, am I losing you (am I losing you)
Am I losing you (am I losing you) ooo, wee
(am I losing you) Am I losing you (am I losing you)
Am I, am I losing you girl (am I losing you)

Little signs, little signs, heh (am I losing you, hey) whoo
Seems like I'm losing you (am I losing you) (am I losing you)
You don't, you don't, you don't, you don't,
You don't, want me no more, naw, naw (am I losing you)
Sometimes, sometimes (am I losing you)
I, I can say things to you girl, you girl
