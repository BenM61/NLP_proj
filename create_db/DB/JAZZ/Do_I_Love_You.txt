Beyond the shadow of a dove 
As the mighty river flows 
As the meadow gaily plays 
With the wind of summer days 
'Bout as deep as we can go 
From the canyon to the skies 
Like a mother as she cares 
For the baby that she bears 

Do I love you 
Don't you know by now 
Do I love you 
Must I show you how 
Do I love 
Must I always say 
Do I love 
Yes in every way 

About as sacred as a hymn 
And a bible full of prayers 
From a whisper to a roar 
Very much and even more 
And I shall show it with my eyes 
And share it with the night 
If in death the good Lord is kind 
You'll be the last thing on my mind 

Do I love you 
Don't you know by now 
Do I love you 
Must I show you how 
Do I love 
Do I have to say 
Do I love 
Yes in every way 

Do I love you 
You should know by now 
Do I love you 
Must I show you how 
Do I love 
Do I have to say 
Do I love 
Yes in every way
