I'm sorry I never meant to hurt you
I really didn't
I'm so sorry
I just want you to sit down for just a minute
Let me talk to you

Last night we had an argument
You told me you love me
All the things I said I never meant
No baby
I didn't mean to make you cry
I didn't mean to make you say bye bye bye
Baby won't you let me look inside your soul
Let me make you lose control
Let me be the one you need
Baby just come to me

Now tell me girl what you want from me
Whatever it is you desire
I want to give my baby
I want to feel your body yearn
All your softest spots I plan to learn
Baby won't you let me just kiss you down
Make you spin around and 'round
Flip you girl from left to right
If you don't mind
Baby can I just spend the night

You know what I'm talking about baby
I never meant to hurt you
I never wanted to see you cry
So I'm right here now baby
I'm asking you, I'm begging you
Just give me one more chance baby

Baby won't you let me just kiss you down
Make you spin around and 'round
Flip you girl from left to right
If you don't mind
Baby can I just spend the night
Let me turn you on

Can I turn you on
Can I turn you on
Till the break of dawn baby

Can I turn you on
Can I turn you on
Till the break of dawn baby
