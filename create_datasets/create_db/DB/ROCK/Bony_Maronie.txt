 G 
 I got a girl named Bony Maronie  
 G 
 She's as skinny as a stick of macaroni  
 C7 
Ought to  see her rock and roll with her blue jeans on  
 G 
She's  not very fat, just skin and bones, but  
 
CHORUS  
 D C7 D C 
 I love her and  she loves me.  Oh how happy now  we can be,  
 G 
making  love underneath the apple tree.  
 
Well, I told her mama and her papa too  
 
Just exactly what I wanna do  
 
I wanna get married on a night in June  
 
And rock and roll by the light of the silvery moon  
 
CHORUS  
 
She's my one and only, she's my heart's desire  
 
She's a real upsetter, she's a real live wire  
 
Ev'ryone turns when my baby walks by,  
 
She's something to see, really catches the eye.  
 
CHORUS  
 
Whistle melody and CHORUS then out
