Half-way to paradise or so it seems that way
Same as anyone the same as any other day.
We seek eternity in all the things we buy
Not top priority but it sure figures very high.
Who steals the real world 
fooling us all as it goes

And who gets to heaven - heaven knows.
When a heart beats you can see forever
When our time sleeps you can be forever
be forever.

Meanwhile in Cuckoo Land
a most delightful place

We look no further 
than the nose in front of our face.
No wood anywhere
we can see only trees
Last train for material refugees.
When a heart beats you can see forever

When our time sleeps you can be forever.
When a heart beats you can see forever
When our time sleeps you can be forever 
be forever.
Don't concern yourself with matters 
past and future
Just put your mind to where they meet.
But when a heart beats fooling us all as it goes

And who gets to heaven - heaven knows.
When a heart beats you can see forever
When our time sleeps you can be forever 
be forever - be forever - be forever - 
be forever - be forever -
Heart beats heart beats - be forever -
Heart beats heart beats - be forever - 
be forever.
