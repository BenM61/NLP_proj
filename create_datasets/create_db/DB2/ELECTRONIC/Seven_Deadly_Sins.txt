You've seen it all before you
You know the truth can be unkind
You fear the worst is hiding
It's when you lose your mind
All I hear is chimes at midnight
Only seven deadly sins

You hear the words denying
You can't believe but you try
When you long for what you don't have
It's why you live and die
You say your love is endless

But jealousy is blind
As we speak I rage and tremble
I must be sure you're mine
