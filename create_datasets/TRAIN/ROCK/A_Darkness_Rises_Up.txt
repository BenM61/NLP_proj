Tell me any lie that you want
It's more than I know
You said the words yourself

Tell me any lie that you want
And I will follow
The clock to stop the blood
In shoot our hearts

Woe upon the ones we love
And to those our hearts are wound
There a darkness rises up
And we scream up blood

Think about the burning strands
Woah, I'm on fire
Wrapped up in this flare
For what it's worth

It's tired and old
To mark the ground
We rape to own
In shoot our hearts

Woe upon the ones we love
And to those our hearts are wound
There a darkness rises up
And we scream up blood

And we're all trying to
Not shoot up the strains
And we're all trying to
Not shoot up the strains

So lie upon the ones you love
And to those you do your worst
Pull the flags up off your door
And rinse the blood
