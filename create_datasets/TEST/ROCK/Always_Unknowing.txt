Following the morning star
But there&acute;s no sense
In always running
Take what you want to know
Just give me time
Always unknowing
World passing by
That's how it looks
Always unknowing
Don't you leave my side
There is no sense
In always running
Just one more time
Is all I need
Always unknowing
Hold back tonight
With your sight
Always unknowing
