I want the house (what, yeah)
I want the ice (what, yeah)
I want the dough (yeah, yeah)
Just let it flow (c'mon, c'mon, c'mon)
I want the Benz (what, yeah, mm)
I want the Jeep (yeah, haha)
I want the minks (mm, yeah)
So what you think? (what, yeah)

You say you lookin' for a real man (what, what)
A brotha tryin', doin' all he can (and, so what?)
And so I work all night and day (what, yeah)
But then I gotta listen to you say

Boo, we don't ever go nowhere
Don't pay to fix my hair
I need a baller in my world
(Say you need a baller in your world)
If I want someone to pay my bills
I got to keep it real
I'm a high class kind of girl
(See you wouldn't know a real man baby)

You won't know a real man
If he stared you in the face
Say you wanna try to keep it real
Girl I know the deal
You won't know a real man

You say you're lookin' for a money man (I want the dough)
A bank account full of benjamins (I want the Benz)
You ain't got a penny to your name (I want the minks)
But still I gotta listen to you say

I want a man with lots of cash
High class and bubble baths
I need a baller in my world
(Say you need a baller in your world)
If I wanna spend some of your ends
And drive your brand new Benz
(You wanna drive my Benz)
I'm a high class kind of girl
(See you wouldn't know a real man baby)

You won't know a real man
If he stared you in the face
Say you wanna try to keep it real
Girl I know the deal
You won't know a real man

I want the house (what, yeah)
I want the ice (what, yeah)
I want the dough (yeah, yeah)
Just let it flow (c'mon, c'mon, c'mon)
I want the Benz (what, yeah, mm)
I want the Jeep (yeah, haha)
I want the minks (mm, yeah)
So what you think? (what, yeah)

Boo, we don't ever go nowhere
Don't pay to fix my hair
I need a baller in my world
(Do you need a baller in your world?)
If I want someone to pay my bills
I got to keep it real
I'm a high class kind of girl
(See you wouldn't know a real man baby)

You won't know a real man
If he stared you in the face
Say you wanna try to keep it real
Girl I know the deal
You won't know a real man
