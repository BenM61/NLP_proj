They met in a karaoke bar
Jack was singing "Lola" in a long black wig
The TV screen with the lines from the song
Caught the reflection of a girl
He caught her eye and he went wrong
She laughed while he apologized

So they started talking to each other
Mary's friends listening from beyond
And shaking their heads
She had on half a smile as she looked away from him
He was falling victim to her every whim
The barman sighed, a tear in his eye

So they kissed that night and she took him home
Though they were strangers he held her so tenderly
But she thought it might be fun to string him along
She knew it wasn't right; she didn't think it was wrong
She'd stop before he was in love with her
She didn't stop to think she might fall in love with him

Well it went on for a week, a month, a year
Mary somehow forgot to break it off
Now she felt so trapped and she didn't know why
She was so sure that she loved him though it started as a lie
When she realised she broke down and told him
He already knew - he'd read it in her diary the day before

It turned out that he was the same as her
Living a lie on automatic pilot
Now they didn't know what to do
They didn't know who they were
Mary tried to smile, Jack slipped his hand into hers
The barman would have been surprised
