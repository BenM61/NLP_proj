It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Run di track
Ah dem wan fi try and hold mi back
Mi say wolf and culture gwan to di top
Ride di track
The riddim is sweet and di dancehall hot
Crowd of people never wan we fi stop
Run di track
Ah we run di show
Mi say we run di shop
We ah di don numba one and mi say we run dat
We ah the king inna di place
Mi say ride pon di shock
Put your hand inna di air we ah gon burn down di spot

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

And as I'm walking through the subway
All I feel is everybody's piercing eyes (piercing eyes)
I'm following the footsteps all I can imagine is that I'm a guy
You never know maybe she's afraid
And everything around her is so damn fake
I feel like that we've met before
Hurry boy she's waiting

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The sun is rising on east side and every former life is waking up
The feeling of seclusion makes you wanna dream away and fall in love
She drags you in, not afraid
Everything feels like fate
What wrong with you, don't let her go
Hurry boy it's waiting

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
We're gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Hurry boy it's waiting there for you

(Down in A) It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you (Oh)
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do (No oh.)
I bless the rains down in Africa (Rains down in Africa)
I bless the rains down in Africa (Oh bless the rains)
I bless the rains down in Africa (Down in Africa)
I bless the rains down in Africa (Down in Africa)
We're take some time to do the things we never had
