I don't feel a way by what a nigga say
It's alright love, I let a hater hate
Pull up on them see them paper plate

It's a fact right niggas act trife
How they smile in your face then they back bite
I just laugh right, make em' mad like
Watch them turn around and say he ain't that nice

Getting bread dough, mad head hoe
Seems like they don't love you till you dead, yo
Let em' talk dog it, don't phase me

Wanna snitch, man, get us a hundred years

More money brings, more Henessy
More hate, more snakes, more enemies
