If there's something you need
That you just don't have
Well just don't sit there
Feeling badCome on now get up
Try and understand
Just raise you hand
Baby here I am
You know I'm standing in line
I wanna give you my love
Please let me try
Come on now get up
Try and understand
Just raise your hand
