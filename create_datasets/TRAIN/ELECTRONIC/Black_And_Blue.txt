Bring me light, bring me light, bring me light
Black and blue, I will always love you
Black and blue, black and blue,
I will always love you
I will always love you

Calm and still, cold and pale,
I will always
Corpse around
Calm and still
I will always need you

This is how to love you is
Rigid and stiff
This is how to love you is
Rigid and stiff

White and grey, in a daze I will always need
Bleeding on, bleeding on I will always need
Dust and bones, cold as stone I will always love
Black and blue, black and blue
I will always love you
