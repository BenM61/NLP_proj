Sat in the corner you could pass for dead 
Get up on the floor shake your head 
Everybody move it 
Everybody move it 
If you'd rather be home you can leave right now 
This is a party no frowns allowed 
Everybody move it 
Everybody move it 
Bump and grind, have a good time 
Free yourself and lose your mind 

Now the party's pumpin' and the groove is on 
Grab the nearest body and move along 
Go to the next if it don't feel right 
But have no fear, get down tonight 
Everybody move it 
Everybody move it 
Bump and grind, have a good time 
Free yourself and lose your mind 
Everybody move it
