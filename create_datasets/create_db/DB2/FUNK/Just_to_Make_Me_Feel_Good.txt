Ask me things with no warning
Has someone been questioning for you?

She used to lie and abide (In my time)
Just to make me feel good

Don't assume I'm just boring
But mourning a love that's not forming

She used to stray like a bowl in my maze
Just to make me feel good

Someone who really knows you
Offers no mystery to slave through
I can't do that
And it ain't so bad

Ask me why I'm not waiting
For you in your new safe haven
I don't have to do everything twice
Just to make you feel nice

What's to prove with your prying?
You think I'm too dumb to be lying

She laid to rest all the worst of her best
Just to make me feel good

Someone who really knows you
Offers no mystery to slave through
I can't do that
And it ain't so bad

Ask me things with no warning
Ask me things with no warning
Ask me things with no warning
Ask me things with no warning
