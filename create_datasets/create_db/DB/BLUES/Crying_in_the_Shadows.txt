Sometimes he sees her walking by.
He never looks her in the eye.
She doesn't know, she doesn't care,
what he is feeling.
And as she turns to walk away,
there is nothing he can say.
She doesn't know.
Why should she care?
When he's alone, she's never there to see him
crying in the shadows
of a love he used to know,
but now it's all over.
Crying in the shadows
of someone he called his own,
but now he's all alone again.
Sometimes she sees him walking by.

He doesn't know, he doesn't care,
what she is feeling.
And as he turns to walk away,

He doesn't know.
Why should he care?
When she's alone, he's never there.
He leaves her
crying in the shadows
of a love she used to know,
but now it's all over.
Crying in the shadows
of someone she called her own,
but now she's all alone again.
But he can see it in her eyes.
And she can feel it in her heart.
Yes, they can feel it in their hearts.
It's tearing them apart,
over and over again.
Crying in the shadows
of a love he used to know,
but now it's all over.
Crying in the shadows
of someone she called her own,
but now she's all alone.
Crying in the shadows
of a love they used to know,
but now it's all over.
Crying in the shadows
of a love they used to know,
but now they're all alone again.
Crying in the shadows.
Crying in the shadows of love.
Crying in the shadows.
Crying in the shadows of love.
Crying in the shadows.
Crying in the shadows of love.
Crying in the shadows.
Crying in the shadows of love.
Crying in the shadows.
Crying in the shadows of love.
Crying in the shadows.
Crying in the shadows of love.
Crying in the shadows.
Crying in the shadows of love.
