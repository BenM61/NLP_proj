Who's that walkin' 'round here? 
Mercy! 
Sounds like baby patter 
Baby elephant patter, that's what I calls it) 

Say, up in Harlem, at a table for two, 
There were four of us, me, your big feet and you 
From your ankles up, I say you sure are sweet, 
From there down, there's just too much feet! 

Yes, your feet's too big! 
Don't want ya 'cause your feet's too big! 
Can't use ya 'cause your feet's too big! 
I really hate ya 'cause your feet's too big! 
Yeah! 

Lah-dee-doo-dah, 
Nah-dah-nah-dah 
Where d'ya get 'em? 
Nah-dee-ah-dah

Your girl, she likes ya, she thinks you're nice, 
Got what it takes to be in paradise 
She said she likes your face, she likes your rig, 
But, man, oh, man, them things are too big 

Oh, your feet's too big 
Don't want ya 'cause your feet's too big! 
Mad at ya 'cause your feet's too big 
I hate ya 'cause your feet's too big 

My goodness, gun the gunboats! 
Shift! Shift! Shift!) 

Oh, your pedal extremities are colossal 
To me you look just like a fossil 
You got me walkin', talkin' and squawkin', 
'Cause your feet's too big, yeah 

Come on and walk that thing 
Oh, I never heard o' such walkin', Mercy! 
You know your pedal extremities really are obnoxious. 
One never knows, do one?)
