We embrace
Judgement day
We embrace new inventions
Find your grace in defeat
We Embrace 
New intentions
Forced on us
By decree

We are the ones to change the world now
Still in control of all machinery
We claim the right to pull the trigger and damage your image of honor

Inventing
Improving
Creating
Existence embrace the technological remedy

Robotic legions, stand in line to carry out
The retribution and effects of this advanced technology
All new inventions have to pay
They have to fight their way to judgement day
(Technological tragedy is near)

We are the ones that rule the world now
You are entrapped by blind inanity
There is no way that you'll revoke your decision 
Now look for distraction

Inventing
Improving
Creating
Existence embrace the technological elegy

Robotic legions, stand in line to carry out
The retribution and effects of this advanced technology
All new inventions have to pay
They have to fight their way to judgement day
(Technological force)

We are the enhanced
Natural leaders
Turning righteous
Into deceivers

Schemes of the mind
Absence of soul
Symbol of the triumph over human race
Cold-blooded kind
Minds are controlled
Doomsday has arrived
There is no escape

I am forever the snake devouring its tail 
In search of eternity

We embrace new inventions
Find your grace in defeat 
We embrace new intentions
No one stands in our way

Inventing
Improving
Creating
Existence embrace the technological misery

Robotic legions, stand in line to carry out
The retribution and effects of this advanced technology
All new inventions have to pay
They have to fight their way to judgement day
(Technological times shall flourish)

Fight your
(We are your leaders)
Way out
(Never displease us)
Show no remorse
