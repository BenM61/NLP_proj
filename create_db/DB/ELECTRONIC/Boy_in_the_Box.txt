When I go out
I can see the world from inside
Without a doubt
I can shake my head and scream and shout
(Because) I can't take it no more
I can't stand it no more

Who's laughin' at me?

Through the night
Was the giant sleeping?
The endless flight
O the mystery's for keeping
(Because) I can't take it no more
I can't stand it no more

Who's staring at me
I gotta say 

Pull up your socks
You're the boy in the box
What did the rebel say?
When the wolf cried fox
To the boy in the box
Will you come out to play

One, two 
You can't get enough
Three, four
Open up the door
Six, five
Alive is the boy in the box

(I gotta say)

Pull up your socks
You're the boy in the box
What did the rebel say?
When the wolf cried fox
To the boy in the box
Will you come out to play

And no one talks 
To the boy in the box
When the world cried fox
To the boy in the box

One, two
I can't get enough
Three, four
Open up the door
Six, five
Alive is the boy in the box

Like a boy in the box
The boy in the box
Like a boy in the box
