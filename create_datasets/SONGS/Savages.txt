Break out again
You start to feel
It's all pretend
This time it's real

Body starts to give in
Try to keep your eyes open

We act so primitive (what!), we're savages!
Do the rain dance, like you're on fire
Like you're on fire!
We're savages (what!)

What!

Shape shift begin
You've lost the fear
You've found a friend
You're safe in here
