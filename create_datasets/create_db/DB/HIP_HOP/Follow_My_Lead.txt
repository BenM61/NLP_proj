Yeah, ladies and gentlemen
I'll like to thank you all for coming out tonight
It's my third album, third tour, third time's a charm

Girl when I go, I wanna take you 'round the globe with me
I got doe, the kinda paper you can blow with me
And baby I know that money ain't everything
But it's for sure and ain't for nothing when you f*** with me
When I go

Follow my lead, baby, I could be all you need
If you follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'll hold you down, put your trust in me
Baby follow my lead

Follow my lead, I think God made you for me
Follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'm the one girl in time you'll see
If you follow my lead

don't listen to the rumors, they say 50 f***in' crazy
50 don't know how to treat a lady, they wrong
I like you a lot, I don't wanna hurt you
But I call a square a square and a circle a circle
So if you act like a b****, I call you a b****
Then hang up, probably call you right back and s***

And I have to say, baby, I apologize
Cross my fingers, God forgive me for tellin' lies
Like Janet Jackson said, "I miss you much?
I really wanna feel your touch and smell your scent
Baby, I could pa** the day watchin' you model lingerie

I wanna spend the night tonight, shorty, if it?s okay
You could be my Beyonce, I'll be your Jay
Ha ha, I gotta great sense of humor
First I'll make ya smile then I woo ya
You know I wanna do ya, or do ya?

Follow my lead, baby, I could be all you need
If you follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'll hold you down, put your trust in me
Baby follow my lead

Follow my lead, I think God made you for me
Follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'm the one girl in time you'll see
If you follow my lead

After seven hours, New York to London
You're wonderin' what's gonna be the next stop
I told you, I'm a don, you gonna know I'm a don
After you shop 'til your feet hurtin' in Milan

Now take a picture, these are moments you can cherish
They say the scenery was made for lovers out in Paris
Ask a fan about me they say, 50, we love him
Without them there's no me so I love them

Man, they're the reason I exist, the reason I insist
I'm never less than the best, I'm perfection I guess
That's why n****s are stressed, I pa** the test
Every time I drop I'm burnin' hot

So I don't care if she loves me or loves me not
Long as I enjoy the time that we spend
I ain't lookin' for commitment, we could f*** and be friends
Matter of fact we can do it right in back in my Benz
I get it done with speed

Follow my lead, baby, I could be all you need
If you follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'll hold you down, put your trust in me
Baby follow my lead

Follow my lead, I think God made you for me
Follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'm the one girl in time you'll see
If you follow my lead

Follow, follow my lead
Follow my lead, follow my lead
Follow my lead
Baby, follow my lead
Follow my lead
