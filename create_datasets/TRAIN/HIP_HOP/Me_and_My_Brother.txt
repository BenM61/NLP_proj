See me and my brother, stay crunk like no other
Stay high as a motherfucka, stay drunk as a mother' fucka'
See me and my brother, stay crunk like no other
Stay high as a motherfucka, stay drunk as a motherfucka
(Verse One: Kaine)
I'm gonna stand there and protest, my nerves is bad
And say I gave a wedding ring threw a plastic bag
Feel it bug the size of many Christmas trees
This must be a jolly green tree for me
Give me that, No sticks or seeds preferred
I need herb the shit that have your sight in a blur
Make you swerve to the curve, cause your eyes are blurry
Easy 12 on the right you bust a left in a hurry
(Verse Two: D Roc)
We ridin' and drankin' rollin' blunts and smokin'
The car fogged up cause there ain't to windows open
The bass beatin' the block down
They know when we rollin around
Leanin' to the side cool and ridin' threw the "A" town
Holla at the kid fo' gotta score some high dro
We bound hurt cats roll blunts like ball bats
And drankin' is a most do (drankin' is a most do)
If you drankin' I got you (If you drankin' I got you)
I got some orange juice and grey goose so pour you a cup
Till your head to the back and get fucked up
Pass the weesha baby sittin now smoke too let me hit it
Puff puff puff pass with your hoggin ass
Roll another blunt with your selfish ass
And give me ten dollars cause I'm low on gas
We gotta hit the motherfuckin gas station
'cause I ain't with pushin' this big ass motherfuckin car man
See me and my brother, stay crunk like no other
Stay high as a motherfucka, stay drunk as a mother' fucka'
See me and my brother, stay crunk like no other
Stay high as a motherfucka, stay drunk as a motherfucka
