And oh, you're gonna love me
You're gonna wanna hug me and squeeze me

Sometimes we say things that we really don't mean
We do things in between the lines
We should do more than stand out
I'm sorry if I made you feel less than who you are
A little insecure, oh, you's a shining star

I wanna spend my nights with you
My life with you, oh baby, babe
Please wait up for me 'til whenever I get home
I know that you're all alone
Thinking 'bout what you're gon' do
I hope that you see it through, ooh, ooh

And oh, you're gonna love me
You're gonna wanna hug me and squeeze me

Sometimes I don't think we really say enough
Why is it so hard to keep in touch
When we're laying right next to each other, baby
We shouldn't read into things so much
Overthinking understanding
Don't let our feeling, change it up

I wanna spend my nights with you
My life with you, oh baby, babe
Please wait up for me till whenever I get home
I know that I'm all alone
Thinking 'bout what I'm gon' do
I hope that I see it through, ooh, ooh, yeah

And oh, you're gonna love me
You're gonna wanna hug me and squeeze me
And oh, you're gonna love me
You're gonna wanna hug me and squeeze me

And are you gonna love me
And are you gonna hold me? And squeeze me
Are you gonna love? And squeeze me
And oh, you're gonna love me
You're gonna wanna hug me
Are you gonna hold me
And squeeze me, squeeze me
And oh, you're gonna love me
You're gonna wanna hug me
You're gonna wanna hold me
And squeeze me, and squeeze me
