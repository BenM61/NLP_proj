Words escape me, now I'm in prison
Sentenced to a life of tears
Now she hates me, that's her decision
Waiting for the smoke to clear

So I can see the damage of the fire
That raged through our love
So I can see the damage, I can try and
Salvage our love

Oh, I'm picking up the pieces
Maybe they'll fit some day
Oh, I'm picking up the pieces
Maybe they'll fit some day

Love recalls me back from darkness
It whispers to an eager ear
She ignores me, oh, why so heartless
Waiting for the smoke to clear

So she can see the damage of the fire
That raged through our love
So she can see the damage, she can try and
Salvage our love

Oh, she is picking up the pieces
Putting them down again
Oh, she is picking up the pieces
Putting them down again

Oh, there's never a match
For a burning desire to fall in love
And put out the fire that's been burning
Burning, burning

Oh, she is picking up the pieces
Putting them down again
Oh, she is picking up the pieces
Putting them down again

Oh, I'm picking up the pieces
Maybe they'll fit some day
Oh, I'm picking up the pieces
Maybe they'll fit some day
