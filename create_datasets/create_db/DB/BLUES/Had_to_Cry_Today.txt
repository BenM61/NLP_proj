It's already written that
Today will be one to remember
The feeling's the same as
Being outside of your door

[Chorus]
Had to cry today
Well I saw your sign
And I missed you there

I'm taking the chance to see
The wind in your eyes while I listen
You say you can't reach me
But you want everyone to be free

[Chorus]
