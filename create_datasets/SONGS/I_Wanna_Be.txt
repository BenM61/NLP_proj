Sometimes you know the words don't come too easy
Sometimes you feel alone and blind
You're walking in the dark
Somebody comes and gives you words of comfort from the heart
And you know that we've all had complications
Wrong roads where you feel you're lost and won't get very far
Somebody comes and gives you some direction and a start

And I want to be the sound that rings in your ears
And I want to be your candle in the dark
And I want to be the hands that bring you back here

I want to be the one you see
I want to be the one you need

Your eyes have seen some things you don't believe in
Sometimes you feel disgust
No faith, should you just fade away
Somebody tells you hold your ground
Don't be afraid

And I want to be the sound that rings in your ears
And I want to be your candle in the dark
And I want to be the hands that bring you back here

I want to see you, I want to touch you
I want to feel you, I want to be there if you

And I want to be the sound that rings in your ears
And I want to be your candle in the dark
And I want to be the hands that bring you back here

I want to, I need you, I want you to know

And I want to be the sound that rings in your ears
And I want to be your candle in the dark
And I want to be the hands that bring you back here

I want to be the one you see
I want to be the one you need
