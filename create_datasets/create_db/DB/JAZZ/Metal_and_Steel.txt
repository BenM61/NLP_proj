I am metal I am steel
But I don't mind cause I can't feel a thing
I'm a diamond ring

I'm not flesh & I'm not bone
And I'm not sad & I'm not all alone
I'm a stone

The king is dead and the queen has flown
Left me here in the twilight zone
Lost & looking for a way to get back home
But there's no right & there's no wrong
So I'll be good & I'll be strong

I'll be silver & I'll be gold
Without a heart and without even a soul
I'll be coal
I won't be blood and teeth and skin
& I won't feel this pain I'm in
I'll be tin with no heart within
