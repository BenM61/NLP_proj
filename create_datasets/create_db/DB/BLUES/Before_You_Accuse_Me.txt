Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
You say I've been spendin' my money on other women
But you've been runnin' with somebody else
 
I called your mama 'bout three or four nights ago
I called your mama 'bout three or four nights ago
Well your mother said 'son,
Don't call my daughter no more'
 
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
Well now you say I've been runnin' around
But you got somebody else
 
Come on back home baby, try my love one more time
Come on back home baby, try my love one more time
Well now you've been gone away so long
I'm gonna lose my mind
 
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
Well now you say I've been buyin' other women clothes
You've been taking money from somebody else
