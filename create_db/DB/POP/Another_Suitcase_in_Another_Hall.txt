(Eva:)
I donÂ´t expect my love affairs to last for long
Never fool myself that my dreams will come true
Being used to trouble I anticipate it
But all the same I hate it, wouldnÂ´t you?

(Eva:) So what happens now?
(Che:) Another suitcase in another hall
(Eva:) So what happens now?
(Che:) Take your picture off another wall
(Eva:) Where am I going to?
(Che:) YouÂ´ll get by, you always have before
(Eva:) Where am I going to?

Time and time again IÂ´ve said that I donÂ´t care
That IÂ´m immune to gloom, that IÂ´m hard through and through
But every time it matters all my words desert me
So anyone can hurt me, and they do

(Eva:) So what happens now?
(Che:) Another suitcase in another hall
(Eva:) So what happens now?
(Che:) Take your picture off another wall
(Eva:) Where am I going to?
(Che:) YouÂ´ll get by, you always have before
(Eva:) Where am I going to?

Call in three months time and IÂ´ll be fine, I know
Well maybe not that fine, but IÂ´ll survive anyhow
I wonÂ´t recall the names and places of each sad occasion
But thatÂ´s no consolation here and now.

(Eva:) So what happens now?
(Che:) Another suitcase in another hall
(Eva:) So what happens now?
(Che:) Take your picture off another wall
(Eva:) Where am I going to?
(Che:) YouÂ´ll get by, you always have before
(Eva:) Where am I going to?

(Huevo:)
DonÂ´t ask anymore.
