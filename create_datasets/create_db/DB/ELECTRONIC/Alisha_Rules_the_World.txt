She's an angel, but she sins sometimes 
Dressed in white, gets drunk on red wine 
Everyone loves her 
But a child plays for pleasure and she'll play with your heart until she 
Breaks down your defences one by one 
So line up your soldiers and she'll shoot them all down 
'Cause Alisha rules the world 
You think you found a dream, then it shatters and it seems, 
That Alisha rules the world 
For her love of power, and she's as fragile as a flower 
But you better 
Line up your soldiers and she'll shoot them all down, 
'Cause Alisha rules the world 

Alisha always walks where angels fear to fly 
Perfection baby - you know you're qualified 
Everyone loves her 
But a child plays for pleasure and she'll play with your heart until she 
Breaks down your defences one by one 

So line up your soldiers, and she'll shoot them all down 
'Cause Alisha rules the world 
You think you found a dream, then it shatters and it seems, 
That Alisha rules the world 
For her love of power, and she's as fragile as a flower 
But you better 
Line up your soldiers and she'll shoot them all down 
'Cause Alisha rules the world 

And when it all comes down you realize 
It's just her playful heart inside your mind 

So line up your soldiers and she'll shoot them all down, 
'Cause Alisha rules the world 
So line up your soldiers and she'll shoot them all down, 
'Cause Alisha rules the world 

Alisha rules the world 

You think you've found a dream 

Alisha rules the world 

Line up your soldiers and she'll shoot them all down, 
'Cause Alisha rules the world 
You think you found a dream, then it shatters and it seems, 
That Alisha rules the world 

So line up your soldiers and she'll shoot them all down, 
'Cause Alisha rules the world 
You think you found a dream, then it shatters and it seems, 
That Alisha rules the world 

So line up your soldiers and she'll shoot them all down,
