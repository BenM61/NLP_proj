There's a young boy in the queue
Not much else for him to do 
He's had a drink, he's had a few 
Down the pub on Hope Street 

Dear old lady, you're looking thin 
Got a shopping bag with your life in 
Your old man's going through the bins
It's down and outs on Hope Street

Rain on me come pouring down 
Clean the dirt off this old town 
Tell the sun to come around
And show his face on Hope Street

There's a fight right down the street 
The betting shop has got him beat 
Blew his money for the week
On a horse called Hope Street 

No old faces out today 
Someone took them all away
Cleaning up or so they say 
The dirty face of Hope Street 

Rain on me come pouring down... 
Everyday I look at you 
Dressed up in your ties of blue
Saying there's not much you can do 
To help the kids on Hope Street

They don't seem to even care
That it was you that put them there 
You seem to think they like it there
Hanging out on Hope Street

Rain on me come pouring down...
