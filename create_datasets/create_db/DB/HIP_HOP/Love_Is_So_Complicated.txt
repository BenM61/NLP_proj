Went threw all the small talk to be with you, took my time tryin' to get it back

If I could understand, (understand)
what called you here, it's for my good that I have you near

Oh love, love is so complicated the way that I feel about you, (about you baby)
Make me wanna change my attitude
What I feel this here cant be real (can't be real)
I think I'm gonna chill right here cause I wanna be with you.

I long to kiss you girl, along your spine, give you mine
Keep it souls replied
Unplug the phone girl
It's just me and you
Submerge into the deepest part of you

If I could understand (understand)
What brought you here (what brought you here)
