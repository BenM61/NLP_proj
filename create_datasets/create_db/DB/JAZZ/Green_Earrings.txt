Cold, daring 
No flies on me 
Sorry, angel 
I must take what I see 
Green earrings 
I remember 
The rings of rare design 
I remember 
The look in your eyes 
I don't mind 

Greek medallion 
Sparkles when you smile 
Sorry, angel 
I get hungry like a child 

Green earrings 
I remember 
The rings of rare design 
I remember 
The look in your eyes 
I don't mind
