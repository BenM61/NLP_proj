Every face 
Even the one you saw yesterday 
It looks different today 
Cos everything's changed since yesterday 
In every possible way 
Things seem different today 
Not like yesterday 
Is consideration 
More like an exception - of consideration? 

Cos you have the world in your arms tonight 
And what if you held the world in your arms? 

When you're secure, do you feel much safer? 
As days never change, and it's three years later 
It's like your life hasn't changed, 
And it's three years late 
So how does it feel, to be three years late? 
And watching your youth drift away 
What seems different, seems different today 
And what seems different, seems different today 
Is consideration 
More like an exception - of consideration? 

Cos you have the world in your arms tonight 
And what if you held the world in your arms? 
You have the world in your arms tonight 
And what if you held the world in your arms? 
(tonight...) (tonight...) 

Cos you have the world in your arms tonight 
And what if you held the world in your arms? 
Cos you have the world in your arms tonight 
And what if you held the world in your arms?
