They tried to assassinate me, can't get past my shield
Got a hundred fresh disciples learnin' how to kneel

What I ain't got, they beg borrow steal
They're my hundred fresh disciples learnin' how to kneel

Hundred fresh disciples, babe, I got a hundred fresh disciples

Don Fredo on the phone line, he's tryin' to make a deal
Just another fresh disciple learnin' how to kneel

When I give him what he wants, then baby don't he squeal
Got a thousand fresh disciples I've never yet revealed

Kick!
Bass!

Hundred fresh disciples, babe, I got a hundred fresh disciples

Hundred fresh disciples, babe, I got a hundred fresh disciples, baby
