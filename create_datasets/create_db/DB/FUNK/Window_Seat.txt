O, presently I'm standing
Here right now
You're so demanding
Tell me what you want from me

Concluding
Concentrating on my music, lover, and my babies
Makes me wanna ask the lady for a ticket outta town
So can I get a window seat

Don't want nobody next to me
I just want a ticket outta town
A look around
And a safe touch down

Window seat
Don't want nobody next to me
I just want a chance to fly
A chance to cry

And a long bye bye
But I need you to want me
Need you to miss me
I need your attention

I need you next me
I need someone to clap for me
I need your direction
Somebody say come back

Come back baby come back
I want you to need me
Come back come back baby come back
Come back come back baby come back

Come back come back baby come back
So, in my mind I'm tusslin'
Back and forth 'tween here and hustlin'
I don't wanna time travel no mo

I wanna be here
I'm thinking
On this porch I'm rockin'
Back and forth light Lightning Hopkins

If anybody speak to Scotty
Tell him beam me up
So can I get a window seat
Don't want nobody next to me

I just want a ticket outta town
A look around
And a safe touch down
Window seat

Don't want nobody next to me
I just want a chance to fly
A chance to cry
And a long bye bye

But I need you to miss me
Need somebody come get me
Need your attention
Need your energy yes I do

Need someone to clap for me
Need your affection
Somebody say come back
Come back baby come back

I want u to need me
Come back come back baby come back
Come back come back baby come back
Come back come back baby come back

But can I get a window seat
Don't want nobody next to me
I just want a ticket outta town
A look around

And a safe touch down
I just need a chance to fly
A chance to cry
And a long

Bye bye
