Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon

There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
It's where you are
Somewhere there's heaven
How near, how far

The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

'How high the moon'
Is the name of the song
How high the moon

Though the words may be wrong
We're singing it because you ask for it
So we're singing it just for you

How high the moon
Does it touch the stars
How high the moon
Does it reach out to Mars

Though the words may be wrong to the song
We're asking a high, high, high, high
High is the moon

Though the words may be wrong to the song
We're ought to make high, high, high, high
High is the moon
