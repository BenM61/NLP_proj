You can call me a sinner
Or you can call me a saint
Celebrate me for who I am
Dislike me for what I ain't
Put me up on a pedestal
Or drag me down in the dirt
Sticks and stones will break my bones
But your names will never hurt

I'll be the garden
You'll be the snake
All of my fruits
Is yours to take
Better the devil that you know
Your love for me will grow
Because
This is who I am
You can like it or not
You can love me
Or leave me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop
No no

Cleopatra had her way
Mata Hari too
Whether they were good or bad
Is strictly up to you
Life is a paradox
And it doesn't make much sense
Can't have the femme without the fatale
Please don't take offense

Don't let the fruit rot
Under the vine
Fill up your cup
And let's drink the wine
Better the devil that you know
Your love for me will grow
Because
This is who I am
You can like it or not
You can love me
Or leave me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop
No no, you know

This is who I am
You can like it or not
You can love me
Or leave me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop
No no, you know
No no, you know
No no, you know
No no, you know
No no, you know

I'll be the garden
You'll be the snake
All of my fruit
Is yours to take
Better the devil that you know
Your love for me will grow
Because
This is who I am
You can like it or not
You can love me
Or leave me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop
No no, you know

This is who I am
You can like it or not
You can love me
Or leave me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop
No no, you know
No no, you know
No no, you know
No no, you know
No no, you know
