Long misty days
Told me they would change their ways
Once in a while will come my way

The thrill is gone
Misty days linger on and on
Once in a while is here to stay

We feed this fire
Lovers in a nursery rhyme
The words belong to you
And the melody was mine

Long misty days
Told me in a million ways
Once in a while will come my way

Oh how the moon
Shining at a lonely room
Weeping willow cry for me

Sing me a song
Simple as the day is long
I love someone crying to be free

And take the sky
And tell me if the moon is blue
And if it's meant to be
That my melody was used

Long misty days
Told me in a million ways
Once in a while will come my way

Long misty days
Told me they would change the ways
Once in a while is here to stay
