Well, if your hands start to clappin'
And your fingers start to poppin'
And your feet start to movin' around
And if you start to swing and sway
When a band starts a-play
A real cool 'n way out sound
And if you get the can't help it's
And you can't sit down
You feel like you gotta move around

(You need a shot of rhythm and blues)
With just a little rock an roll on the side
Just for good measure
(You need a pair of dancin' shoes)
With your lover by your side
Then you know
You're gonna have a lot of pleasure

So, don't you worry 'bout a thing
When you start to dance and sing
And chill bumps come up on you
And when that rhythm finally hits you
When the beat gets you through
Well, here's the thing for you to do

(sax & instrumental)

(Get a shot a-rhythm and blues)
With just a little rock n roll on the side

Then you know
You're gonna have a lot of pleasure
