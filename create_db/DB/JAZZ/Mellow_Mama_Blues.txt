Well, I know my days are numbered
And I know I'm livin' fast
I've got a mellow man who loves me
And mellow whiskey in my glass
So I'll just stick around
And wait for the time to pass

Yes, I know I'm not good lookin'
But I'll put you in your place
No, I know I'm not good lookin'
But I'll put you in your place
You can't tell me what I'm likin'
By just lookin' at my face

I've got a secret way of lovin'
And I own the copyright
I'm gonna put it on the market
And do all my business right
I know my man is crooked
And I know my whiskey's straight
And I know that man can send me
For he feels just like a snake

Yes, I'll thrill you, baby
I can really satisfy your soul
Yes, I'll really thrill you, baby
I can satisfy your soul
I've got a secret way of lovin'
And it never has been told
