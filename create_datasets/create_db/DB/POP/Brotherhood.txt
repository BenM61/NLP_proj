United we stand
Divided we fall
That's how it is in the brotherhood
In the brotherhood, brotherhood
Forever we'll stay
Together and strong
Growin' up in the brotherhood
In the brotherhood, brotherhood

Brothers are your best friends
By your side until the end
Always there to lend a hand
All do all they can
See, brothers stand tall
All for one and one for all
I'll do all that a brother could
To make it good in my brotherhood

I'll be there for them
Whenever they're in need
We share a common band
See I learned it from a brother and I
Taught it to my younger
I realise that life is hard
And it has it's ups and downs
There's no need to worry 'bout a thing
'Cause I know all is good in my brotherhood

That special bond
That holds us three as one
Makes me feel so good inside
It makes me feel so strong
I'll never turn my back on them
As long as I live
Whenever I have a problem
I know to rely on my brotherhood
