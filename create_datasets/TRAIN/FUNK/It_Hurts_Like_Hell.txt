Oh, baby 
Oh oh, babe 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh, baby 

Love was always supposed to be 
Something wonderful to me 
To watch it grow inside yourself 
To feel your heart beside itself 

Sometimes it hurts to love so bad 
(When you know you've given all you can) 
Sometimes it hurts to even laugh 
(You do your best but it's still much too sad) 
Sometimes the pain is just too much, oh oh 
And it hurts like hell, that's the way it feels 

True love, it has no hiding place 
It's not something you just put away 
It's always there inside of you 
Oh, and it shows in everything you do 

Sometimes it hurts to love so bad 
(When you know you've given it your best) 
Sometimes it hurts to even laugh 
(You feel a thousand miles from happiness) 
Sometimes the pain is just too much, oh oh oh 
And it hurts like hell, that's the way it feels 

Oh oh, oh oh 
Here we are, the two of us 
So full of love, so little trust 
But dying for some tenderness 
Oh, but too afraid to take the step 

Sometimes it hurts to love so bad 
(When you know what it can put you through) 
Sometimes it hurts to even laugh 
(There's nothing funny if it's killing you) 
Sometimes the pain is just too much 
And it hurts like hell, that's the way it feels 

I know if there is any chance 
For us to find our happiness 
We've got to learn to let it go 
Oh, forget all the pain we know 

Sometimes it hurts to love so bad (sometimes it hurts so bad, baby) 
Sometimes it hurts to even laugh (sometimes it hurts to even laugh, oh) 
And it hurts like hell, that's the way 
Oh baby, that's the way it feels 
Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah
