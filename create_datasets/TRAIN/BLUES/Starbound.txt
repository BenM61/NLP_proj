When you and I are ready, 
No longer earthly-bound
We'll travel through 
The crystal night, starbound
Heaven holds a mystery, 
Wrapped inside a sound
Through the eyes of time, 
Starbound, you and I
A floating star is what we are
Suspended in space
Outward-bound it's 
The only home we've found
To save the human race
Speed is now their captain, 
Kings that lost their crown
Motion is our master, starbound
Starbound
Starbound
