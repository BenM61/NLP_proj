Hold tight
Hold tight
If you wanna make this feeling stay
Hold tight
Hold tight
Don't let this moment fade away
Hold tight
Now tears gonna stay
Everybody gets the chance someday
Call it once it last you think you've got it made
Not a word that anyone can say
That can change the way you feel
Cause you know that love is real
You can choose within you fall in love
Anybody any moment any way
'Cause no matter who you chose
There's a chance that you might loose
Gonna the best that I can do
Hold tight
If you wanna make this feeling stay
Hold tight
Hold tight
Don't let this moment fade away
Now tears gonna stay
Hold tight
If you wanna make this feeling stay
Hold tight
Hold tight
Don't let this moment
Hold tight
Now tears.
You can do just anything you want
You can help yourself to anything that's mine
Take it easy when there's no one else
Got to get it right this time
Gonna try to make love shine
Everybody get the chance someday
You just take it when the moment comes along
There's nothing you can say
There's nothing you can do
When you find the eyes of love set on you

Hold tight
If you wanna make this feeling stay
Hold tight

Now's the moment of the lifetime
And its here for you
Come on baby its time to
Make a place now everybody
Got to let us true
Gotta dream to catch the night it might come true
Hold tight
