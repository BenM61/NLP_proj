Oh oh, oh oh, oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh

There's something that I want to say
But I feel like I don't know how
Still I just can't hold it one more day
So I think I let it out

You're on my mind more than I may sure
You're in my heart more than you may know
And the last thing that I want
Is for you to fall apart
The future will be clearer
I want you to remember

In each tear
There's a lesson, (there's a lesson)
Make you wiser than before (wiser)
Makes you stronger than you know (stronger)
In each tear (each tear)
Brings you closer to your dreams
No mistake, no heartbreak
Can take away what your meant to be

We can't change the things,
That we done that's in the past
But fighting won't get us anyway
So if you want, here's my hand
Every night there is one thing I do
I bow my head and I pray for you (pray for you)
And the last thing that I want
Is for you to fall apart
The future will get clearer
I want you to remember

In each tear
There's a lesson, (there's a lesson)
Makes you wiser than before (wiser)
Makes you stronger than you know (stronger)
In each tear (each tear)
Bring you closer to your dreams
No mistake, no heartbreak
Can take away what your meant to be

Your much more than a struggle that you go through
You're not defined by your pain, so let it go
You're not a victim, your more like a winner
And you're not in defeat, you're more like a queen

In each tear
There's a lesson,
Makes you wiser than before
Makes you stronger than you know (stronger than you know)
In each tear (in each tear)
Bring you closer to your dreams
No mistake, no heartbreak
Can take away what your meant to be

In each tear (each tear)
There's a lesson, (there's a lesson)
Makes you wiser than before (wiser)
Makes you stronger than you know
In each tear (make you so much broke)
Brings you closer to your dreams
No mistake, no heartbreak
Can take away what your meant to be

No no we can't be held out
No no oh no I I I can't be held out
You you you can't be held out
We we we can't be held out

Love
It makes you so much stronger (stronger)
It makes you so much wiser (wiser)
In each tear (in each tear)
And you so close to your dreams and
No mistake, no heartbreak can take away what you're meant to be
