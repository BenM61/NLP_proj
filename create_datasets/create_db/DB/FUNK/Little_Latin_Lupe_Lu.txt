Talkin' bout my baby
Ahhh, Little Latin Lupe Lu
She's a high flyin' baby
Ain't no dance she could'nt do
She's my groovy little baby
Whoa Little Latin Lupe Lu

Ah if you wanna do the duck
Lupe Lu can put it down
And the wah wah watusi
She's the best for miles around
She's my pretty little baby
Whoa Little Latin Lupe Lu

Bama bama Lupe Lu
Oh shake shake it Lupe
Watusi pretty baby
Come on do what you do
She's my pretty little baby
Whoa Little Latin Lupe Lu

Well if you wanna do the twist
Lupe Lu can put it down
And the wah wahtusi
She's the best for miles around
She's my groovy little baby
Woah Little Latin Lupe Lu
