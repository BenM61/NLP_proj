I got fire under my feet
And I feel it in my heartbeat
Oh you can't put out these flames
You can't keep me down in my seat

I got fire under my feet
And I feel it in my heartbeat
Oh go get out of the blaze
If you can't take the heat, fire

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

I tripped and I stumbled
Watched my world crumble
Sometimes you eat dirt
You live or you learn
Thrown in with the lions, the tigers and titans
Afraid to get hurt, but now I'm making them purr

I got fire under my feet
And I feel it in my heartbeat
Oh you can't put out these flames
You can't keep me down in my seat

I got fire under my feet
And I feel it in my heartbeat
Oh go get out of the blaze
If you can't take the heat, fire

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh fire
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Was drowning in quicksand
Nobody grabbed my hand
Thought it buried me
Instead I'm set free
Moving on to bigger things
I begin to spread my wings
No longer in chains
I'm dancing over these flames

I got fire under my feet
And I feel it in my heartbeat
Oh you can't put out these flames
You can't keep me down in my seat

I got fire under my feet
And I feel it in my heartbeat
Oh go get out of the blaze
If you can't take the heat, fire

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh fire
I got fire
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh fire

This may not be
Not be perfect
But I'm happy
And I've earned it
Every tear shed
Will be worth it
Step by step
Ain't looking back
I've no regrets 'cause
I've got

I got fire under my feet
And I feel it in my heartbeat
Oh you can't put out these flames
You can't keep me down in my seat

I got fire under my feet
And I feel it in my heartbeat
Oh go get out of the blaze
If you can't take the heat, fire

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh fire
Yeah yeah yeah
I got fire, I got fire
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yea
Fire, fire, fire
Can you feel it?
Fire, fire, fire

Fire
Can't put out these flames
