Yeah this is for my brothers in the hood
And the high risers
On the mansions with the maids
We gotta come together y'all come on
Case, Ginuwine, Tyrese and me R.L.
Help me sing it fellas, yeah

I'm standing here alone
Trying to face another day
Gotta stay strong, hmm
To endure this pain

I'm dealing with right now
It flipped my whole life upside down
I don't want your help
I don't need your sympathy, no

What can a brother do for me?
(See he can you help you up when you are down)
What can a brother do for me?
(He can be your eyes when you can't see)
What can a brother do for me?
(He can help me be the best man I can be)
(Oh I can be, I can be oh I can be, I can be)
He can help me be the best man I can be
(Oh yeah, yeah, yeah) (Be the best man)

I made a big mistake
And I'm feeling so ashamed
And I don't want to lose
My friendship over it
I've gotta keep the faith, yes I do

'Cause I'm still your boy
I've got your back
That'll never, never, never never gonna change
So I can just cite the truth
And keep smiling in your face

What can a brother do for me?
(He can you help you up when you are down)
What can a brother do for me?
(He can be your eyes when you can't see)
What can a brother do for me?
(He can help me be the best man I can be)
(I can be, I can be oh I can be, I can be)
He can help me be, the best man I can be

I keep struggling but I'm trying my best
I got some issues with my own confidence
Lord help me to forgive and forget
Can you please help me to be a better man?

For the rest of the darkest nights
Shines the brightest sun
I hate the man I used to be
I'm better than before

What can a brother do for me?
(He can you help you up when you are down)
What can a brother do for me?
(He can know the wrong to make it right)
What can a brother do for me?
(He can be your eyes when you can't see)
What can a brother do for me?
He can help me be the best man I can be
(I can be, I can be I can be, I can be)
He can help me be the best man I can be
(I can be, I can be I can be, I can be)
Help me be he best man I can be
(I can be, whoa I can be oh I can be, oh I can be)
Help me be the best man I can

'Cause he's my brother brother, brother, brother
Yes he is my brother brother, brother, brother

See when I'm down on my luck and I'm
Crying 'cause a woman done left me I ain't got nothing
And it's cold outside
He'll give me a ride when it's late at night
'Cause he's my brother, brother brother, brother
See sometimes I may go astray
But he'll lead me back the right way
And tell me everything's okay
'Cause he's my brother, brother brother, brother
Brother, brother, brother, brother, brother
Oh I know sometimes you'll need me and I got your back
Oh 'cause I know you got mine 'cause you're my brother
And I love you, love you, love you
You can count on me, sing it
Case, Tyrese and G, you are my
Brother, brother, brother, brother

R.L oh my brother, brother, brother
Late up at night
If you need a helping hand
Just call on me
Talking 'bout my brothers, brothers, brothers
All across the world
My brothers yeah, I love you
