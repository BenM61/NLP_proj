Yeah

They're dancing on the ceiling, they're dancing on the floor
People everywhere coming through the door
They know there's a party going on
Through the dance and romance all night long

I know it's cold outside
Come on baby, I'll keep you satisfied
All you got to do is move
Every time you steal that groove

It ain't nothing but a party
It ain't nothing but a party
It ain't nothing but a party, baby
It ain't nothing but a house party

Come on baby dig that crazy soul
I know you're gonna lose control
You can do the boogaloo
Anything that you want to

I know it's cold outside
Come on baby, I'll keep you satisfied
All you got to do is move
Every time you steal that groove

It ain't nothing but a party
It ain't nothing but a party
It ain't nothing but a party, baby
It ain't nothing but a house party
Yeah c'mon, yeah
I know baby

I know it's cold outside
Come on baby, I'll keep you satisfied
All you got to do is move
Every time you steal that groove

It ain't nothing but a party
It ain't nothing but a party
It ain't nothing but a party, baby
It ain't nothing but a house party

I said move it, groove it
Baby, don't you lose it
I said, roll is, stroll it
Baby, don't control it

It ain't nothing but a party baby
It ain't nothing but a party baby
It ain't nothing but a party baby
It ain't nothing but a house party

It ain't nothing but a party
It ain't nothing but a party
It ain't nothing but a party
It ain't nothing but a party

It ain't nothing but a party
It ain't nothing but a party
It ain't nothing but a party
Comes in the body

It ain't nothing but a party
It ain't nothing but a party
Comes in the body
