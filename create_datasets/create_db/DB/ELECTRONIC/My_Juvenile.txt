Down the corridor
I send warmth
I send warmth

Down the staircase
I send warmth
I send warmth

Thank you for, again
To get to be able
To send warmth
To send warmth

Perhaps I set you too free
Too fast
Too young

But the intentions were pure
But the intentions were pure

My juvenile
My juvenile
My juvenile
I truly say
You are my biggest love

I clumsily try to free you from me
One last embrace
To tie a sacred ribbon

This is an offer to better the last let go
This is an offer to better the last let go
This is an offer to better the last let go

The intentions were pure

My juvenile
My juvenile
My juvenile
My juvenile
My juvenile
My juvenile
