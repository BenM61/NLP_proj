Oh in my wonder
A gaze at my lover
I hear the thunder
As they walk away
They walk away
They walk away
They walk away
They walk away

Nothing now sacred
Go and forsake this
Pray that I perish
Reclaim your relic
Fills you with hatred
Left me sedated
Look what I'm faced with
Moment you'll cherish
I see your menace
I cannot take this
State of neurosis
Effecting my closest
Making no progress
Still look on hopeless
Double the dosage
Self medicate
Fills you with hate
Burden again, vermin astray
Righteous prophet led the vermin away

Drowning in wonder
Taking me under
Pray for the thunder
As they walk away
Forever in hunger
I pray that the others
Wait for the thunders
As they walk away
They walk away
They walk away
They walk away
Walk
Away

Bet with the Devil indebted I lost
Paid with my soul and now fret at the cost
Watching him revel and laugh at my loss
Sick with the sins that I failed to wash
Met with the Devil indebted I lost
Paid with my soul and now fret at the cost
Watching him revel and laugh of my loss

Nothing now sacred
Your praying I perish
I see your hatred
This here forsaken
Go and I'll make it
Go and forsake this
A moment to cherish
Reclaim your relic
This only makeshift
The omen now faceless
I am nobody
I'm just a vessel
Not holy or special
I'm just a vessel
You're holding your medal
I see your hatred
I see your hatred
Watching you perish

Walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away
They walk away
Walk away
They walk away
Walk away
They walk away
Walk away
They walk away
Walk away
They walk away
Walk away
