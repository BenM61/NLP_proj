Absolutely Everybody

Absolutely everybody, 

Everybody needs a little loving, 
Everybody needs somebody thinking of them. 
Everybody needs a little respect, 
And whatever it takes, 
I'm gonna get it. 

Everybody needs a hand to hold, 
Someone to cling to 
When the nights are getting cold. 
I'm no different, 
I am just the same, 
A player in the game. 

Absolutely everybody,
Everybody, everybody. 
Absolutely everybody 
In the whole wide world. 

Absolutely everybody, 
Every boy and every girl, 
Absolutely everybody. 

Everybody needs a human touch.
I can't live without it, 
It means too much to me. 
Everybody needs one true friend, 
Someone who'll be there â€˜til the very end. 

And absolutely everybody breathes, 
And everybody, everybody bleeds. 
We're no different, 
We're all the same, 
Players in the game.

Absolutely, everybody, 
Everybody, everybody. 
Absolutely everybody 
In the whole wide world. 
Everybody breathes, 
And everybody needs. 
Absolutely everybody. 

Absolutely everybody.

Every boy and girl,
Every woman and child. 
Every father and son.
I said now everyone, 
Yes now everyone. 

Everybody needs a human touch.
Everybody, everybody needs love. 
I'm no different, 
I am just the same, 
A player in the game.

Absolutely everybody.
