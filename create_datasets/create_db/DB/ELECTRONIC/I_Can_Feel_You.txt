Hold your breath, don't cry, they're coming
Tainted secrets, don't die, they're coming

And if you wait for dawn to fade
You should see the dark
And as the gold defines your pain

I can feel your heart
Open from the start
I can feel your soul
Yearning to my call
I can feel you

Hold my hand, don't hide, cause they're comin'
Fallen angels, fly by, and they're comin'

So if you wait for dawn to fade
You should see the dark
And as the gold defines your pain

I can feel your heart
Open from the start
And I can feel your soul
Yearning to my call
I can feel you
