Oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ah
Oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ah
Shimmy Shimmy Ko-Ko-Bop
Shimmy Shimmy Bop
Shimmy Shimmy Ko-Ko-Bop
Shimmy Shimmy Bop
Sittin' in a native hut
All alone and blue
Sittin' in a native hut
Wonderin' what to do
Along came a native girl
Did a native dance
It was like in paradise
Put me in a trance
Going
Shimmy Shimmy Ko-Ko-Bop
Shimmy Shimmy Bop
Shimmy Shimmy Ko-Ko-Bop
Shimmy Shimmy Bop
Joined her in her dancin' spree
Felt my spine a-tingle
Held her tight and close to me
Man I'm glad I'm single
Then she showed me what to do
First I was amazed
Soon I learned a step or two
Put me in a daze
Going
Shimmy Shimmy Ko-Ko-Bop
Shimmy Shimmy Bop
Shimmy Shimmy Ko-Ko-Bop
Shimmy Shimmy Bop
Shimmy Shimmy Ko-Ko-Bop
Shimmy Shimmy Bop
You can do the ko-ko-bop
Now's no time to stop
Left foot forward right one back
Bring them side by side
Uh syncopate your last two steps
Now you're going to glide
Keep along the rhythm track
Girls please show 'em how
Now you start to arch your back
Man you got it now
Going
Shimmy Shimmy Ko-Ko-Bop
Shimmy Shimmy Bop
Shimmy Shimmy Ko-Ko-Bop
Shimmy Shimmy Bop
