Poor poor me
I need someone to love me
Poor poor me
I need someone to love me
I'm all alone lonesome as I can't be
So all alone have no one to call my own
So all alone have no one to call my own
Oh what I need someone to hold in my arms

I feel so bad
I feel so sad and blue
I feel so bad
I feel so sad and blue
Won't somebody please help me
Tell the world am I to do
