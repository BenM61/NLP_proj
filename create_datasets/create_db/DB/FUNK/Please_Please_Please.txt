Oh, oh, oh,oh

I don't mind your love
I don't mind the one
You're thinking of

But I know, I know
You're going to miss me

I don't mind
Your lovesick soul
I don't mind your
Care growin' cold

But I know, I know
You're going to miss me

I don't mind
This is all my song
I don't mind
Goodbye, so long

But I know, I know
You're going to miss me
Goodbye, so long
I don't mind
