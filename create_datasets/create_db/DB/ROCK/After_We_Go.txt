Do you know how we got right here 
Is it something we probably asked for 
All the answers are not quite clear 
But the question is one that you can't ignore 

We walk around like we don't live with consequence 
And still believing what we do is right 
So how's it feel to run and hide for your defense 
You're not the only one to face the fight 

It's been a long time 
Believe it or not 
We've got a strong mind 
But we never remember to use it 
Something tells me that we've got to be suffering 
After seein' everything 
I can't believe we still don't know 
What it is that we think we're searching for 

After we go 
It seems the same mistakes will carry on 
That's what we get for giving up 

I don't know how long this will last 
But I will keep on pushing 
I've gotta make all the time that has passed 
Turn into reasons to get me through it

We have to realize there's more to it 
Than we could ever see there was
