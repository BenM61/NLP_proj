Sing baby sing the world is getting better
It's somethin' else since we're together
Let's have a ball, let's do it all and sing
Ain't we got it made
(Sing baby sing)
Ain't we got it made
(Sing baby sing)

Dance baby dance and let the sun shine on us
There ain't a blessed thing to stop us
Let's live it up fill up the cup and dance.
Ain't we got it made

Ain't we got it made, our love song has no end
We're not only lovers we are friends

So cry baby cry, our wedding bells are ringing
And while the happy choir is singin'
This girl and boy through tears of joy will sing
Ain't we got it made
