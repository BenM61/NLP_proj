Crazy little child never got to see
All the pretty things in life
Had him put away, nothing they could say
Could ever make the pieces fit

Aw well, daddy-o was rich, mama was a bitch
Living wasn't easy in between
Behind his silent scream, Jackson in his teens
Was planning his escape

He was a crazy little child, New Orleans Alley playground
Grimy faced, he watched the hookers cry
Winos were his friends and when he talked to them
They said, Jackson, boy, they'll get you by and by

Depression settin' in, desperate, cool and quick

And boy, you just slip in there and bring out all that loot
But Ritz was taken by surprise, couple of unsuspectin' guys
And they left poor Jackson inside

Questions there were few, in fact there were none
When those sheriff's bullet start to fly
Lay dying on the floor with a smokin' forty-four
He said, I must admit the winos were right

Crazy little child, never got to see
All the pretty things in life
We buried him today, nothing we could say
Could ever make the pieces fit

Yeah, I must admit the winos were right
Oh, I must admit the winos were right
His last words were
I must admit the winos were
