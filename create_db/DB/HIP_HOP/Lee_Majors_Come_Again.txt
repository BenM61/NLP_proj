Doin' it big 
I'm the lyrical mathematical, genius 
Splashin' like lime juice
You never seen this 
Internationally known 
The longest the leanest
Shout out the one Jose Nenis
Hit 'em with the rhyme
And the rhyme don't stop 
Yeah we got the beat
And the beat go drop
The ping pong paddle 
Make the batter go pop
Now take a look around this spot
I'm seeing every detail
Like an over-cranked camera
Sleestacks in the back say "Damn ya!"
You say "I can't", and "I say "Why can't you""
Chopping the track in the - in the land of...

Yo wanna buy this you wanna take that
Wanna wanna try this wanna wanna make that
You can't abide this you wanna fake that
Take a look around you
Yo wanna buy this you wanna take that
Wanna wanna try this wanna wanna make that
You can't abide this you wanna fake that
Take a look around you

There's a bird in here
That's my D.J. not Dr. Brassiere
Dropping bombs like a bombardier
Cocao he's a chocolatiere
We're giving y'all a little slice of heaven
B boys bringing it back to A7
Deal with the schism, ride on the rhythm
Sweet like pie and the pie's what I give 'em
I'll stage a coup and usurp your position
'Cause like a Mormon, we on a mission
We're audible-visible, cadence is lyrical
Got the mental and physical when the moment is critical

You wanna buy this you wanna take that
Wanna wanna try this wanna wanna make that
You can't abide this you wanna fake that
Take a look around you
Yo wanna buy this you wanna take that
Wanna wanna try this wanna wanna make that
You can't abide this you wanna fake that
Take a look around you

Lee Majors come again
Like the sixteen billion dollar man
Ooh watch out, in the back of the bus, gonna bust
Lee Majors style

I said stop watch how I flip
Bill Piedmont with the kung fu grip
Haymaker round house show can't continue
At the roller rink down in Virginia
Oh did I spill the beans
I see your grandpa in Apple Bottom jeans
A Von Dutch cap Ugg boots to match
Once the word gets out you can't take it back
I'm a pause tape competition expert winner
Just a doggone long armed tall yarn spinner
You want to battle? Easy now star
My DJ's so nasty he needs a sneeze guard

You wanna buy this you wanna take that
Wanna wanna try this wanna wanna make that
You can't abide this you wanna fake that
Take a look around you
Yo wanna buy this you wanna take that
Wanna wanna try this wanna wanna make that
You can't abide this you wanna fake that
Take a look around you
