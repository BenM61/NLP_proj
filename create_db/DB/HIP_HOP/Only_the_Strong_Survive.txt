(Yah  DJ Krush in the house  the carmel kingpin CL Smooth and only the strong survive)
 
Actual facts
The ghetto reacts to warfare 
Real bullets miss you by your hair 
Survival of the fittest 
Hell for the three time losers 
The prisoners of enemy maneuvers 
Hold down the fort 
Coz life is short enough to get it taken 
Forsaken when your mental planes' breakin' 
Concealin' a four pound with every area 
We surround coz clown 
I get down for my crown 
Take it to the streets for the 
Honor and respect 
Connect the lethal 
Plus my young guns are unbeatable 
Aiding and abetting the foul 
Is a violation 
That's why my retaliation 
Is premeditation 
The invitation 
Is to run with a crew you can't do 
And too great to infiltrate from a 
Nickel plate 
I state 
This be the illest ever known on a rush 
Swervin' with the Krush 

Slip into the world of shiesty individuals 
A troubled man stalked by criminals 
Creeping through the city 
I step on the block to chat with 
Thugs from all the drugs for fat cat 
Stepping off the set now hand on my tool 
Thinking how bad I want to flip on that fool 
Times are wasting 
Chasing these punks for petty loot 
When there is a real mission to execute 
I put the plan in effect 
Forget what you heard 
When you get the word from first and third 
For real I got the fam and all my soldiers to feed 
With the gunslingers on the block puffin' weed 
Envision the prison that I walk through 
Leaving any witness 
When I'm about to handle my business 
No escape from the duct tape and artillery 
Now tell me big man 
Where's the money ain't a damn thing funny 
 
Cops play for medals 
Killers play for corners 
In the middle are your sons and are 
Your daughters 
Who gives the orders 
To chaos and mayhem 
Who has the proper guidance and mind to save them 
From this cold world of heartless ghetto dwellers, 
Pimps, prostitutes, and dope sellers 
Strive to be the lead and not follow 
Ladies 
You can be the queens of tomorrow 
Dig it, I want all that and more 
For my peeps in the struggle 
Food, clothing, and shelter 
Is essential 
To maintain the hardcore from the soft 
That pushed me to the edge but I can't fall off 
My battlegrounds keep the sound of babies crying, 
Gunshots, and cursing 
Can you feel my reel 
Here's the deal 
By any means necessary 
Go all out 
And keep this alive 
Coz only the strong survive
