Oh angel, 

When I first saw you I already knew,
There was something inside of you.
Something I thought I'd never find,
Angel of mine.

I look at you (looking at you) looking at me,
Now I know why they say the best things are free.
Gonna love you 'til the end of time,
Angel of mine.

What you mean to me you'll never know
Deep inside I need to show

You came into my life sent from above,
Better than a dream, such a perfect love.
And I'll adore you 'til the end of time,
Angel of mine.

Woah waoh, angel, yeah, oh 

Nothing means more to me than what we share,
No one in this whole world can ever compare.
Last night the way you moved is still on my mind,
Angel, angel, of mine.

What you mean to me you'll never know.
Deep inside I need to show,

You came into my life (my life) sent from above.
Better than a dream, such a perfect love, perfect love.
And I'll adore you 'til the end of time
Angel, angel, of mine, of mine
Angel, oh angel, angel.

I never knew I could feel each moment
As if it were new.
Every breath I take or vow that I make
I want to share it with you, share it with you.

When I first saw you I already knew,
There was something inside of you,
Something I thought I'd never find,
Angel of mine.

You came into my life, sent from above, up above baby
Better than a dream, such a perfect love
You're such a perfect love
And I'll adore you 'til the end of time
Angel of mine .

What you mean to me you'll never know.
Deep inside I need to show,

I look at you, looking at me,
Now I know why they say the best things are free.
Gonna love you 'til the end of time
Angel of mine.
