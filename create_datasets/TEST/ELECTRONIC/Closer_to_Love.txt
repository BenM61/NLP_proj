I know it's true, it's on the moves
When done my faith
I try to make sense of you
To fill that empty space
 
Only see you when my eyes closed
When I'm alone, when I'm alone
So call me down from my high hopes
Let me go, and let me go
 
I thinking about, thinking about you
Stop me thinking about, thinking about us
Can't stop thinking about, thinking about you
Wanna get closer to love
 
Thinking about, thinking about you
Stop me thinking about, thinking about us
Can't stop thinking about, thinking about you
Wanna get closer to your love
 
(Closer to your love)
(Closer to your love) I wanna get closer
(Closer to your love)
(Closer to your love) I wanna get closer
(Closer to your love) 
(Closer to your love) I wanna get closer
(Closer to your love) 

I can't change what's broken
Or how the wind blows
(Change how the wind blows)
I let you in but you only one needed
It's impossible
 
Only see you when my eyes closed
When I'm alone, when I'm alone
So call me down from my high hopes
Let me go, and let me go
 
I thinking about, thinking about you
Stop me thinking about, thinking about us
Can't stop thinking about, thinking about you
Wanna get closer to love
 
Thinking about, thinking about you
Stop me thinking about, thinking about us
Can't stop thinking about, thinking about you
Wanna get closer to your love
 
(Closer to your love)
(Closer to your love) I wanna get closer
(Closer to your love)
(Closer to your love) I wanna get closer
(Closer to your love) 
(Closer to your love) I wanna get closer
(Closer, closer, closer)
(Closer to your love)

Boy you broke my heart so don't you try to damped me
Begged for me to stop loving you ain't easy
All you think about is you, think I need somebody new
Who can satisfy my mind stop me thinkin' all the time

Thinking about, thinking about you
Stop me thinking about, thinking about us
Can't stop thinking about, thinking about you
Wanna get closer to love
 
Thinking about, thinking about you
Stop me thinking about, thinking about us
Can't stop thinking about, thinking about you
Wanna get closer to your love
