A million men forlorn 
A secret place to stay 
And the sun forces the light 
To keep them warm and save 

A dreamland full of secrets 
Fighting all alone 
The forces of the darkness 
A hundred miles away from home 

A fellowship was born 
To fight the evil force 
When the light defeats the night 
The days turned warm and bright 

Those men fulfilled their mission 
Fought against the storm 
The treasure is the secret 
Keeping daylight bright and warm 

When we're all alone 
Darling close your eyes 
Enter the land of fate 

Wherever a sign is 
Whenever a secret falls apart 
She's my colored secret light 
A mystic flavored guide
