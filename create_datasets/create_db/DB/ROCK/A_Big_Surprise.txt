No use in our pretending we don't know what we know
We know a lot of things
I know each muscle on your back and every toe
But you've held out on me, I can tell from your eyes
Disguising the ace that you hold

I want a big surprise tonite
A really big surprise tonite
It's boy meets girl and here we go once again 

Where is that Yankee ingenuity
Somebody told me how the motion picture would end
I turned and glared at them
And then I read the way the world was going to end
With a whimpering sound, not a banging away
I'm sorry I gave it away 

I want a big surprise tonite
A really big surprise tonite 

It's boy meets girl and here we go once again
I want a big surprise tonite
A really big surprise tonite 

It's boy meets girl and here we go once again
Where is that Yankee ingenuity
I want a big surprise tonite
A really big surprise tonite
It's boy meets girl and here we go once again

Where is that Yankee ingenuity
Break the rules and make a fool out of me
Where is that Yankee ingenuity right now 

I want a big surprise tonite
A really big surprise tonite
