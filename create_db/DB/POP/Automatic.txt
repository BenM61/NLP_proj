Oh, some people take it far
You need friction, but they try too hard and
Oh, they just don't understand
Too much pressure, it's supply demand

I don't think you know
You open up my eyes, I'm alive
I'm moving to your rhythm and your vibe
I love it when the night gets started

Oh darling you are the only one, it's automatic
No one can love the way you do, it's automatic
When you walk in the room you change my mood, it's automatic
It's automatic, it's automatic
Oh darling you are the only one, it's automatic
No one can love the way you do, it's automatic
When you walk in the room you change my mood, it's automatic
It's automatic, it's automatic

Oh, the place that needs my touch
I know you want it, but I can't give too much
So, intoxicated baby
You're in trouble, but you don't need no saving

I don't think you know
You open up my eyes, I'm alive
I'm moving to your rhythm and your vibe
I love it when the night gets started

Oh darling you are the only one, it's automatic
No one can love the way you do, it's automatic
When you walk in the room you change my mood, it's automatic
It's automatic, it's automatic
Oh darling you are the only one, it's automatic
No one can love the way you do, it's automatic
When you walk in the room you change my mood, it's automatic
It's automatic, it's automatic

Huh, higher
Huh, higher
Huh, higher
Huh, higher

Huh, higher
Huh, higher
Huh, higher
Huh, higher

Baby boy, won't you come closer
Baby boy, won't you get closer, to me

It's automatic, it's automatic
It's automatic, it's automatic
It's automatic, it's automatic
