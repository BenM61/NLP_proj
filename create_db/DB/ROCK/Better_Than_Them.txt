This is our town, this is Friday night
Dressed in our rags and our rage and our best
Piercing eyes looking for something - anything, anyone.
Stare across the floor as they begin to dance

Missing all the rhythms and the chosen right steps
And we laugh and we drink in our corner again
We're better than them 
Divided we were born, divided we live

Divided we fall, divided we die
Still we tell ourselves over and over again
We're better than them 
With our hunger and our hatred, we all walk this town

With our fear and our weakness - just holding on
With our doubt and our emptiness and this cold, cold frown
We've got to be so important, we'll put the whole damn world down 
And we build the walls that we can hide behind

And our finest weapon is our poisoned pride
Here in this town where the jealousies burn
We're watching you 
'Cause truth is only what we need it to be

To bring us survival through each and every day
When nowhere is safe and nowhere is home - just be cool 
And what was she wearing and what did he say?
Who goes with who and what did they do?

We tell ourselves over and over again
We're better than them , we're not like them
