All you folks back home
I'll never tell you this
You're not supposed to know
Where your daughter is
There are ways of life
You never understood
It's right here

Downtown Hollywood
It's afternoon on Sunset Boulevard
I've got a stolen moment trying hard
To write a kind of Christmas card
But I am burning out again
Tonight there is fever in my veins

Mama, dear all the love you gave
I guess there's really nothing
Nothing much to save
This place is as steady as I feel myself
There are still some riches at the Roosevelt
That evening prayer, those memories

In my little bedroom, mama, on my 
Knees that's where I am at
Down in Los Angeles
And I am burning out again
And I must rise above the shame
Tonight there is fever in my veins

Just think of the girl I used to be
You were my age once, mama twenty-three
I can still hear some of the songs you used 
To play from that summer of love in sixty-eight
Seems it's turned into a winter of hate
And I am burning out again
