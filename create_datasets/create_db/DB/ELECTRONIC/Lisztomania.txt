So sentimental
Not sentimental no
Romantic not discussing it
Darling I'm down and lonely
When were the fortunate only?
I've been looking for something else
Too late, too late, too late, she'll be late, too late, too late
So go slowly discourage
Distant from other interests
On your favorite weekend
Ending this love for gentlemen only
That's where the fortunate only
No I gotta be someone else
These days it comes, it comes, it comes, it comes, it comes and goes

A Lisztomania
Think less but see it grow
Like a riot like a riot oh
Not easily offended
Know how to let it go
From the mess to the masses

A Lisztomania
Think less but see it grow
Like a riot like a riot oh
Not easily offended
Know how to let it go
From the mess to the masses

Follow, misguide, stand still
Discuss, discourage
On this precious weekend
Ending this love for gentlemen only
Wealthier gentlemen only
Now that you're lonely
Too late, too late, too late, she'll be late, too late, too late
So go slowly discourage
We'll burn the pictures instead
When it's all over we can barely discuss
For one minute only
Not where the fortunate only
But I better be something else
These days it comes, it comes, it comes, it comes, it comes and goes

A Lisztomania
Think less but see it grow
Like a riot like a riot, oh
Not easily offended
Know how to let it go
From the mess to the masses

A Lisztomania
Think less but see it grow
Like a riot like a riot oh
Not easily offended
Know how to let it go
From the mess to the masses
Oh
This is show time, this is show time, this is show time
Oh
This is show time, this is show time, this is show time
Time, time is your love, time is your love, yes time is your love

Time, time is your love, time is your love, yes time is your
From the mess to the masses
A Lisztomania
Think less but see it grow
Like a riot like a riot oh
Discuss, discuss, discuss, discuss, discuss discourage
