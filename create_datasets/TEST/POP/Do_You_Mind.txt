If I say I love you do you mind 
Make an idol of you do you mind 
If I shower you with kisses 
If I tell you honey this is 
How I think of heaven do you mind 

I want to whisper, whisper sweet nothings in your ear 
Nothings that are meant for my love alone to hear 

So then 
If I say I love you do you mind 
Make an idol of you do you mind 
If I shower you with kisses 
If I tell you honey this is 
How I think of heaven do you mind 

I want to whisper, whisper sweet nothings in your ear 
Nothings that are meant for my love alone to hear 

So then 
If I say I love you do ya mind baby 
Make an idol of you do you mind 
If I shower you with kisses 
If I tell you honey this is 
How I think of heaven do you mind 

Do you mind 
Do you mind 
Honey do you mind
