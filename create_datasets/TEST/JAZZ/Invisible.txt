Now we tried to fix it up
But its too late
Lets give up had enough
No more mistakes
Here we go, here we go
Cus you cant see where I'm coming from
I feel so invisible

My lady got me going crazy cus
We be having problems and
I think that she ready to go away
Well she could be happy cus
We be steady arguing and I cant really take it no more, no no
Too much of fussin' and fightin'
This used to be so exciting
And now its just not inviting no more
Now baby why even bother if we cant help one another over

Now we tried to fix it up
But its too late
Lets give up had enough
No more mistakes
Here we go, here we go
Cus you cant see where I'm coming from
I feel so invisible

She cant see me, hey she cant see me
The girl cant see me, NO she cant, she cant ( I'm invisible) x2

My lady don't even be listening
I be tryna tell her but she said she cant take it no more.
Because she cant really handle it
Love is something scandalous
I just let her walk out the door, whatever
Whatever happened to whats meant to be?
So why don't we simply
Stop playing games mentally (games, games, games)
Whatever we do, we did lets hurry up and just get it over

Now we tried to fix it up
But its too late
Lets give up had enough
No more mistakes
Here we go, here we go
Cus you cant see where I'm coming from
I feel so invisible

She cant see me, HEY she cant see me
The girl cant see me, NO she cant, she cant ( I'm invisible) 'x2

Im invisible, I'm invisible, I'm invisible
I got no visual
I be talking she be walkin, walkin with her eyes closed
Trying to get her attention, does she see me' No she don't
I'm invisible, I'm invisible
I'd be yelling in her face but she don't even notice
I be speakin she be creepin, creepin with her eyes close
Check her out, there she go creepin with her eyes closed

But its too late
Lets give up had enough
No more mistakes
Here we go, here we go
Cus you cant see where I'm coming from
I feel so invisible

Now we tried to fix it up
But its too late
Lets give up had enough
No more mistakes
Here we go, here we go
Cus you cant see where I'm coming from
I feel so invisible (I'm invisible)

I'm invisible ( fades until song ends)
