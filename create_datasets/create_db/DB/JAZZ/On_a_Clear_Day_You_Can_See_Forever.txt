On a clear day
Rise and look around you
And you will see who you are 

On a clear day
How it will astound you
That the glow of your being
Outshines every star

You'll feel part of every mountain
Sea and shore
And you can hear 
From far and near
A world you've never heard before

But on that clear day
On that clear day
You can see forever
And ever
ever more

You'll feel part of every mountain
Sea or shore
And you can hear 
From far and near
A world you've never heard before

On that clear day
Oh, on that clear day
You can see forever
And ever
Ever more
