In the back of the club of the range rove
Take your hand and turn up the radio, tryin' to holla at you

I like 'em brown, yellow, Porto Rican or Haitian
Slim, thin waist with a beautiful face and
Yeah, you know though you got the mono log
Timbs on, yes headstrong rollin' for dollo

I see you in the summer time wearing capris
Looking so good it feel like a 100 degrees
Mami please, I need me a chick to stay down
Hittin' so many cities, they call me greyhound

I'm searchin' for the finest, the type of girl that's rough
But still a diamond, tastes like Phyllis Haimand
I'm looking for a mami, a girl that'll chill and discuss
And play the cut, don't be sayin' too much

But I'm not consuming them, some say that I'm booin' them
But 20 cent do, I'm known for baggin' two of them
That's how we doin' them, it ain't hard to tell
You need to holla at the boys called ATL
