I've got too much in front of me
And not enough left behind
I've got too much in front of me
I didn't leave enough behind

I can hear the devil whisper
Paying no heed to what you said
I can hear the devil whisper
Staking no way to his grave

And I'm all torn down
With these northern blues
Got my soul in a world of
Some post-mortem dream
I keep rolling on
Howling at the moon
But I'm all torn down
With these northern blues

I have no understanding
For standing outside of time
Three hundred thousand hours
Still I remain hungry for the lie

The world is disappearing
Little by little, day by day
Three hundred thousand hours
Still the weather it has not changed

And I'm all torn down
With these northern blues
Got my soul in a world of
Some post-mortem dream
I keep rolling on
Howling at the moon
But I'm all torn down
With these northern blues

I'm all torn down
With these northern blues
I'm all torn down

I keep rolling on
Howling at the moon(
But I'm all torn down
With these northern blues

Northern blues
