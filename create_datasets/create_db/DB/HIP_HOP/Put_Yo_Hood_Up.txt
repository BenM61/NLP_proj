Put yo hood up! (4X)

Represent yo' shit muthafuuuucka (2X)
Represent yo click muthafuuuucka (2X)

Well shake yo' drink up and spray the muthafuckin' crowd (2X)
Throw yo' click up and say it muthafuckin' loud (2X)
Now drop yo' bows on em' and get buck ass wild (2X)
You supposed to act up with a black and fuckin' mild (2X)

And them southside niggas will put you in a trunk

Stomp stomp stomp nigga
Jump jump jump nigga
