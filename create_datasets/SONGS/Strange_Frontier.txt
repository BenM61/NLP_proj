Into the shadows
From out of the light,
Into the darkness
And into the night,
We're off the tracks
We're off the lines
You and me seen better times
Now we're on the borderline
And I wish I wasn't here
People say, it could never happen here
But this is a strange frontier

Had some good times
Had some fun
Soon our problems
Could be none
We're on the skids
We're off the lines
We're out of luck
We're out of time
Now we're on the borderline
We've nearly gone and done it this time
People say it could never happen here
But this is a strange frontier

Freedom fighters come and go
Bloody, righteous
And mentally slow
We're out of work
We're out of time
We're out of luck
We're out of line
Now we're on the borderline
We've really gone and done it this time
People say it could never happen here
But this is a strange frontier

Take your children while you can
But there's nowhere you can run
No more tears and no more fun
Someday soon they'll drop the big one
No more dad and no more mum

This is a strange frontier
