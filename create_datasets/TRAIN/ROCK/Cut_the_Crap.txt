I love the sound of silence
The beautiful sound of silence
'Cause it gives me something else to break
I'm loud God damn it
You shut the door, I slam it
A load of dynamite powder
It's loud God damn it, I'm louder
Cut it on, so I can hear it
Cut it up, 'cause I can't feel it
Cut it out, before I snap
Cut the crap
Cut the crap
Cut the crap
Cut the crap
Cut it on, so I can hear it
Cut it up, 'cause I can't feel it
Cut in out, before I snap
Cut it on, so I can hear it
Cut it up, 'cause I can't feel it
Cut it out, before I snap
Cut the crap
Cut it on, let's get it on
Cut it up, let's get it up
Cut it out, I'll kick it out
Cut the crap
Cut the crap
Cut the crap
