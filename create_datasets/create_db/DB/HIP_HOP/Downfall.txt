I'm broken and beaten down
I feel so defeated now
It's me against the world
I feel like I'm the one who's bleeding out

My minds so depleted now
Should I just be leaving now?
Can I restart it all?
Control Alt Delete it now

I'm tired of yesterday
Let's see what tomorrow brings
I'm trying my best to say
These words I keep swallowing

Demons keep following me
Screaming they're calling for me
No more free falling for me
I'll steal the time I'm borrowing

Dreams are dreamt broken
Worlds shattered and choking
And I'm stuck here hoping
There's something for me

We all fall down sometimes
And it makes it hard to believe
We can learn to somehow survive
No matter how much we bleed

We can make it (and now we know)
We can make it (so don't let go)
(Don't let go)

Every time I wake up
It's hard to believe I opened up my eyes
I try to stay up
But I keep on falling and I don't know why
Everything's fucked
And I can't keep living wearing this disguise
Can I change my luck or am I stuck in time until I die?

Dreams are dreamt broken
Worlds shattered and choking
And I'm stuck here hoping
There's something for me

We all fall down sometimes
And it makes it hard to believe
We can learn to somehow survive
No matter how much we bleed

We can make it (and now we know)
We can make it (so don't let go)

After it all
We are the ones who suffer the downfall
After it all (after it all)
We are the ones who suffer the downfall
After it all (After it all)
We are the ones who suffer

We all fall down sometimes
And it makes it hard to believe
We can learn to somehow survive
No matter how much we bleed

We can make it (and now we know)
We can make it (so don't let go)
(Don't let go)
