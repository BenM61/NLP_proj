Can I sit next to you?
Can you sit next to me?
Get the stars out your eyes
Come and bring them to me

I been down so long
I've been working on a plan, yeah
It's just that I been down so long
I gotta give me my mind what I can

Can I sit next to you?
Can you sit next to me?
I walked to Memphis alone
'Cause you'd do it for me
Ooh, I know you would

All of the kicks from the sticks
All the kicks that we knew
I put all that aside
Concentrate on you

All the kicks from the sticks
All the hits that we took
All them stitches we got
All our brains so cooked

Ah ah ah, some day I'm gonna get where you are
I've been down so long
Been down but now I gotta get lifted up

I'm gonna walk a tightrope
Gonna get kicks every night
No one's holding me back
No one's changing my mind no more

Gonna walk a tightrope
Gonna get kicks every night
No one's holding me back
No one's changing my mind

Get the stars out your eyes
Come and sit next to me
Under Tennessee skies
Down on South Front Street

Ah ah ah, I've been working on a plan, yeah
I been down so long
Been down but now I gotta get lifted up
