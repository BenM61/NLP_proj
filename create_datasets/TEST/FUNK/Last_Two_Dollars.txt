A lady at the casino
She lost all of her money
She said don't feel sorry for me no
Don't feel sorry honey

But if you want to do a lady a favor
Here's what I want you to do
Just loan me two dollars
Until the next time I see you

But these last two dollars
I'm not gonna lose
These last two dollars
I'm not gonna lose
One's going for my bus fare
Other one for the jukebox
To hear me some blues
To hear me some blues

She said I wouldn't be over here
If my man had been treating me right
I came here to try to catch him, yeah
'Cause he's been sneaking around every night

But I got caught up over here
Got caught up in this scene
And put all of my money
In that doggone gambling machine

But these last two dollars
I'm not gonna lose
These last two dollars
I'm not gonna lose
One's going for my bus fare
Other one for the jukebox
I got to hear me damn some blues oh lord

Last two dollars
I'm not gonna lose

Last two dollars

Bus fare, jukebox hear some blues
