Well they called the flat plains Kansas a long, long time ago
When they'd seen the gates of glory and the fire down below
The many great decisions of the people in this place 
You could tell the strength within them, you could see it their face

Well it's been 9 or 10 years since I started my ramblin' round
And from hand to mouth I was livin' playing every bar in town
Though a dollar a day didn't go too far I could never deny my pride
I couldn't lay back and be taken care of while the world went by outside 

So I went to school to learn but I didn't like what they'd teach
And I went to church to pray but I didn't like what they'd preach 
I was hard-headed, young and angry, and I felt I could take the heat 
And I had to find out my own way how to live out on the street 

So I packed my bags and I left here to peruse the streets alone 
And I saw that side of midnight where the beggars howl and groan 
Places filled with desperation where the future ain't so bright 
But I remember back in Kansas when we sang a song at night 

We sang every step of the way 
Though your dreams can be real don't let them slip slide away 
Doesn't matter at all, let them do as they will 
Someday you'll hear them call for you

Goin'  around and round from town to town I tried to make my way 
I believed that all my searching and struggling would payoff bug some day 
As a teenager I was rowdy and I played for good and bad
Though I knew my songs had meaning at times it made me mad

And I'd fight the wars of nations if it brought somebody peace
Yes I'd fight the wars of madmen if I knew the fight would cease
But this ol' world never stopped turning when my mind was full of doubt
So I went on and played for a dollar a day and I sang  this song straight out 

Hey hey, every step of the way 
Though your dreams can be real, don't let them slip slide away 
Doesn't matter at all, let them do as they will 
Someday you'll hear them call for you
Oh yeah , for you
When they call out your name say it loud and clear 
Come on, come on 

You must have seen me traveling' around you must have seen me there
Tryin' to find out where I was heading you could have tossed to care 
Well, I had all the questions, I wanted the answers 
I knew in my heart it was all part of the game 
But every step was so much harder,  every step of the way 
I knew that time would beat me someday 

Hey hey, every step of the way 
Though your dreams can be real, don't let them slip slide away 
Doesn't matter at all, let them do as they will 
Someday you'll hear them call for you
Oh yeah, for you
