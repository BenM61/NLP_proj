Ann wants to dance
She scares them all
She’s far too pretty for that 
Dancing hall

It shook the stage
A cannonball
Dave almost fell but she
Took the fall

For him
For him
For him
For him

Ann wants to dance
I do recall
Her freckled face glowing
Down the hall

Between her legs
A waterfall
Ann wants to yell she can
Only moan

For him
For him
For him
For him

Ann wants to dance
She scares them all
She’s far too pretty for that
Dancing hall

It shook the stage
A cannonball
Dave almost fell but she
Took the fall

For him
For him

For him
For him
For him
For him
For him
For him
For him
