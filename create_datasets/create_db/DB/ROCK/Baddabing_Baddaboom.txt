I lie for you
I lie and cheat and still I cry for you
And when I'm in your arms I die for you
And so comes a little death, hmm hmm

I'm blind for you
The only man to cross my line is you
My house of cards has been designed for you
My daddy's got a mafgic trick

Baddabing baddaboom
Baddabing baddaboom
Everytime my baby's in my room
Baddabing baddaboom
Baddabing baddaboom
I'm crazy, crazy for you
Bing baddabing baddabing baddabing
Bing baddabing baddaboom boom boom

I lie for you
I lie and wait for the night for you
This Cleopatra's got her eyes for you
Tucked away inside my bed

I dream of you
I am the cat who got the cream for you
You know I crawl and scratch and scream to you
You do that dirty trick again, hmm hmm

Baddabing baddaboom
Baddabing baddaboom
Everytime my baby's in my room
Baddabing baddaboom
Baddabing baddaboom
I'm crazy, crazy for you
