So my friend
Voices from the past reunite at last
Back when we grew up on the streets
The world was at our feet

Do you recall the two of us
How we used th sing when everything
Was new to us

From the time that we were old
Enough to stand
It was you and I together to the end

Oh, what our souls believe we will
Always be
Blood brothers time can't divide
What our hearts have said with a 
Drop of red
Blood brothers till the end

Through these years
Time has not been kind to others left behind
These streets where you and I once played
Nothing's left today

What happened to the dreams we shared
Do we just go on like it was
Never there

Do I tell you that there's hope beyond
These walls
That to help you I'd do anything at all

What our souls believe we will
Always be
Blood brothers time can't divide
What our hearts have said with a
Drop of red
Blood brothers, the bond we made never
Will break
Blood brothers to the end
