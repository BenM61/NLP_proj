I like staying with my Uncle Dave 
And I like playing with his great dane
But I don't fit
I feel alien and strange Kinda out of range

I like riding in my Uncle's car
Down to the beach where the pretty girls all 
parade
And movie stars and paparazzi play
The Charles Atlas kicking sand in the face game

And I sit in the canyon with my back to the sea
There's a blood red dragon on a field of green
Calling me back

Back to the Black Hills again
Ooh, ooh, Billy come home

Billy is searching for his native land
Flicking through the stations with the dial in his 
head
Picking up, and

Billy taps out Jim's number on the 'phone
Sits shaking as he waits for Jim's answering tone
Come on my friend, speak to me please
The land of my fathers is calling to me
And I sit in the canyon with my back to the sea
There's a blood red dragon on a field of green
Calling me back, back to the Black Hills again
Ooh, ooh, Billy come home

Come on home
He sits in the canyon with his back to the sea
Sees a blood red dragon on a field of green
He hears a male voice choir singing Billy come 
home
Billy, Billy, come home
Come on home

I don't like fish.
You are listening to KAOS here in Los Angeles. 
I don't like fish. 
Yes, we've established that. Ah! Do you have a request? 
Shell fish, guppy, salmon, shrimp and crab and lobster, flounder.I hate fish, but I think most of all I hate fresh fish, like trout. I hate fresh trout. My least-hated, favourite fish would be sole. That way you don't have to see the eyes. Sole has no eyes. 
Oh no! 
I'd like to be home with my monkey and my dog 
Thank you. 
I'd like to be home with my monkey and my dog I'd like to be home with my monkey and my dog I'd like to be home with my monkey ... 
They don't care. Shut up. Play the record.
