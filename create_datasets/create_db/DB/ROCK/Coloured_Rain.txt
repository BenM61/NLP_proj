Yesterday I was a young boy
Searching for my way
Not knowing what I wanted
Living life from day to day
'Till you came along
There was nothing but an empty space and a pain

Feels like coloured Rain
Tastes like coloured Rain
Bring on coloured Rain
Yeah!

I can see a sail of changing
Filling with surprise
United with a feeling
Bringing love into my eyes
Till you came along
There was nothing but an empty space and a pain
