In those days, we were lions
In those days, we were kings
It's not one thing or the other
It's all things all at once

Ooh, I will love you better than him (x5)

OOooh (x6)

And these wings aren't for flying
These wings are just for show
It's years since I've been flying
I'm down to the earth

Ooh, I will love you better than him (x5)

OOooh (x6)

In those days we were lions
In those days we were kings
