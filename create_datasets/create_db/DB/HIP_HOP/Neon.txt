I keep running, running, running, running back to it
Anytime that I think I'm there 
It disappears just a little bit (yeah) 

And I want it want it want it want it more than anything 
More than I should 
And I don't know how to quit

And I've been thinking 
Maybe you're a mirage 
I just don't know yet 
Is it all in my head 
Is it all a lie 

And I know that may be one day in time 
It'll all make sense 
Am I chasing the wind
I'll know at the finish line

And I can see the light
Burning up the sky
I can hear the heavens cry
And everything's neon (neon, neon, neon, neon) 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And everything's neon (neon, neon, neon, neon)

I keep falling, falling, falling, falling over again
But I don't feel the ground
I know I'll get up again (oh yeah)

And nothing, nothing, nothing can ever take my eyes off you
You're all that I ever knew
I'll see you in the end

And I can see the light
Burning up the sky
I can hear the heavens cry
And everything's neon

And I can see the light
Burning through the night
I can hear the heavens cry
And everything's neon (neon, neon, neon, neon)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And everything's neon (neon, neon, neon, neon)

And I know I know its calling me
And I can see the light
Burning up the sky (burning up the sky)
I can hear the heavens cry (I can hear the heavens cry)
And everything's neon (everything is neon)

And I can see the light
Burning through the night 
I can hear the heavens cry
And everything's neon (neon, neon, neon, neon)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And everything's neon (neon, neon, neon, neon)

And I know I know its calling me
