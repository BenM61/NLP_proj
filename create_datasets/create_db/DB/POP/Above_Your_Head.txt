Your voice
Is taking me to some higher level
Your arms
They protect me against the nasty world
Your eyes 
Is an ocean i like to swim

You're my seat belt
You'll hold me tight if ever i crash

	I'm eleven hundred feet above your head
	But i'm still thinking about you when i'm there

Your hands
Always guide me to some better place
Your hair
Draw the lines of your tenderness

You're my seat belt
You'll hold me tight if ever i crash

	I'm eleven hundred feet above your head
	But i'm still thinking about you when i'm there
