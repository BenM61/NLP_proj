Before my eyes, lies
Nothing but lies
I cannot believe the scenes
Taking place beneath our skies

It makes me want to do my time
In a song or on the silver-screen
Humanity is the biggest cancer
Ever to be seen

Before my eyes, lies
Civiliesation
Ancient and wicked
Destruction in creation

No matter how low you are
There's always someone to look down upon
And it goes "FUCKIN'"
On and on

Emotionless, obscene
But a human life don't mean
Anything to me
It's merely a seed of insanity

Emotionless, obscene
But a human life don't mean
Anything to me
It's merely a seed of insanity
