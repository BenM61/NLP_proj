I taste you infinite colors
Collide in a fountain
I missed all the lovers

Kaleidoscope dream,
Kaleidoscope dream (kaleidoscope dream) kaleidoscope dream
Kaleidoscope dream (kaleidoscope dream) can you imagine

a field of red lights
It flickers and flashes
Our joy is electric

Kaleidoscope dream,
Kaleidoscope dream (kaleidoscope dream) kaleidoscope dream
Kaleidoscope dream (kaleidoscope dream)

Oh oh, breathe oh oh,
Close your eyes oh oh, you're with me oh oh yeah
Reach high, taste the sky
Just hold, my, hand
Across, the Moon, of hope to fly
You're safe, with me, you're safe, with me

Oh yeah, body language like piano keys
Allow me to provoke babe
You can sing the melody
Every single stroke babe
And as I kiss your third eye
Bet your love come sweet
Only you can be my Kaleidoscope dream (dream)

Kaleidoscope dream (dream)
Kaleidoscope dream (dream)
Kaleidoscope dream (dream)

All these helium hues in array of amusement
Flicking the stars from the sky

Kaleidoscope dream,
Kaleidoscope dream (kaleidoscope dream) kaleidoscope dream
Kaleidoscope dream (kaleidoscope dream) yeah

Body language like piano keys
Allow me to provoke babe
You can sing the  melody
Every single stroke babe
As I kiss your third eye
Bet your love come sweet
Only you can be my Kaleidoscope dream

Kaleidoscope dream,
Kaleidoscope dream (kaleidoscope dream) kaleidoscope dream
Kaleidoscope dream (kaleidoscope dream) yeah, yeah

Reach high, taste the sky, just, hold, my, hand (kaleidoscope dream)
Across the Moon, we'll hope to fly
You're safe with me, you're safe with me, kaleidoscope dream (dream)
