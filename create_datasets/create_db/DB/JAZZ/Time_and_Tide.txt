It's hard for me to stop my heart
Love never knows
When the time is right
I don't want to hurt
Anybody but
Can't help loving you

I never felt like this before
I know this is passion
Worth waiting for
Let love take take its course
That's the only thing
For us to do

We got time, oh baby,
There's no rush
Gonna be a better
Day for us
Hang on
And I will
Wait for you
Our love will always stay as good as new

Time and tide
Nothing and no one
Can stop us now
For better for worse
This time I'm sure
It's gonna last

How can I stop my heart?
Love never knows
When the time is right
Don't want to hurt
Anybody
Don't want to make them cry
Don't want to make them cry

We've got time, oh baby
There's no rush
Gonna be a better
Day for us
Hang on
And I will wait for you
Our love will always stay as good as
New

It's a matter of time

Only a matter of
Time and tide
Nothing and no one
Can stop us now
For better for worse
This time I'm sure
It's gonna last
Gonna last forever

We got time, oh baby
There's no rush
Gonna be a better 
Day for us
Hang on
And I will wait for you
