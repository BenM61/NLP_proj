My friend Dario
Has a super racer car
Drives too fast
Drives to flash
Screeching on the tarmac

Echoes in his head
Then, in his face
Drives too fast
Doesn't care about the crash

Dario knows it's prohibited
You either driver or a trainer
But he dresses for pleasure
Downs a bottle before each trip

My friend Dario has a super racer car
Drives too fast
Drives to flash
Doesn't care about the crash

My friend Dario has a super racer car
Drives too fast
Doesn't care about the crash
