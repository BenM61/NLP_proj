What it was or what it is
You took me off where I left it
Guessing and wandering what I did
All through the night and we drift a little

I knew you before 
I think you're with me, I'm not sure
Didn't know what it was
Don't you know who I am 
'Cause I don't know myself anymore
'Cause I didn't know what it was before 
I didn't what it was

What it is or what it was
You took me in when I got off
Forever keeping me just a bit
Back in a way that still tilts a little

I know you before, a feeling, a motion a wave
I look at you now and question the future

Don't you know who I am 
'Cause I don't know myself anymore
'Cause I didn't know what it was before 
I didn't what it was
