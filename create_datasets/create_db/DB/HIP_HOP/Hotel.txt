I said why you over there lookin' at me?
While I'm with my girlfriend
Why you over there lookin' at me and my girlfriend?
Let's take it to the hotel, let's take it to the hotel

Yeah, I said why you over there lookin'?
Got a starin' problem and you f***in'
I know you see my girl, stop frontin'
I could tell you up to a lil' somethin', hol' up
I'ma play it cool, baby roll one
While you make your way and get over here
My girl ain't down then it's over
Just tell her that she look good when I'm over there
In the first place, pour one up
Baby don't be too thirsty
Groupie love ain't ever gon' work see
Hoes ain't loyal and never keep it low key
That ain't alright
I'ma take a shot, couple shots thru the night
Tell a joke, keep it fun, make her feel it's alright
Give you the game wholesale
And bet a hundred that I take 'em to the hotel

I said why you over there lookin' at me?
While I'm with my girlfriend
Why you over there lookin' at me (and my girlfriend?)
Let's take it to the hotel (we can take it there), let's take it to the hotel
Take it to the hotel, baby leave with me
Know I got a penthouse suite

While I'm with my girlfriend

It's kinda hard when I see you lookin' over here
With them eyes
I got a girl but I'm feelin' your body
So I'ma have to just play both sides
I hope she don't come over here
'Cause I'm with my girl, you know I love 'er
I got two of my b****es in the club
And they know about each other, oh no

But a n**** never Paranoid
You f***in' with a man not a little boy
What? I could barely hear your lil voice
In the club but your body makin' all the noise
Clap it up, stack it up
Where your purse? Just pack it up
Grab her hand, tell her we should go now
If you really wanna take this party to the hotel

I said why you over there lookin' at me?
While I'm with my girlfriend
Why you over there lookin' at me (and my girlfriend?)
Let's take it to the hotel (we can take it there), let's take it to the hotel (baby we can take it there)

Over there lookin' all suspicious
Get a clue girl, don't be a mystery
I see you likin' on all my pictures
Of me and my bi***
Up in all of our business
So, you gotta know it ain't a limit to
What a pill and the liquor do
Make a straight girl go down
Just spit down
I might f*** around and lick her too
It ain't a problem, my metabolism high
Eat you both up for dinner
Just keep it real with a real mothaf***a
Ain't got time for no pretenders
Now just bring it to me
That fleek, that freak, no classy stuff
Been pushin' up, don't p**** now
B****, what you really on?
