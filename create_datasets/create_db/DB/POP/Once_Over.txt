How can you tell me
It wasn't for real
Step into my shoes
And see how it really feels

I know (I know) why you do it
But still I can't stand 
You puttin' me through it
Don't gimme that once over

Don't gimme that once over
That's just one step over the line
Once upon a time I let you be free
There was no reason that I had to feel

I know (I know) it's easy for you to believe
But this time its better for me to give than receive
Don't gimme that once over
Don't gimme that once over

That's just one step over the line
You made the place and time
Now did you think I'd cry
Once in awhile I think of you

Maybe something old
For something brand new
I know ( I know) I know you'll be
Somewhere in the night 

Lookin' for me 
You can seek but you'll never find
Because you can't go back in time
Don't gimme that once over

Don't gimme that once over
That's just one step over the line
Don't gimme that once over
Don't gimme that once over

That's just one step over the line
Don't gimme that once over 
Don't gimme that once over
That's just one step over the line
