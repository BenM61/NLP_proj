In the twenty-first century, you can dance
Get your feet off the ground, get the dummy
And if you believe then you can fly
If a man can read, then he can reply
Hit it, gravity
Yeah, wait a minute, look here

Gravity, the big G
G R A V I T Y, gravity
Say it, gotten a hold on me

For the third verse, the sun
I've been trying to get the funky job done
Pull myself up and work that funk
Don't listen to the wrong honky tonk

You got no sense, you dance too fast
You burn all night, you'll never last
If every man can dream he can defy

G R A V I T Y, gravity, wow, big G
G R A V I T Y, gravity
G R A V I T Y, wait a minute

Slow it down, big city
There's a fat cat there sitting pretty
Watch me break out in a cold sweat
Jump back in, you ain't seen nothing yet

You shake it up, you dance too fast
Make it real, make it last
If every man can dream then he can defy

G R A V I T Y, gravity, the big G
Gravity, G R A V I T Y, say it
Gravity, gotten a hold on me

Let me say that if you can dream
Then you can fly
G R A V I T Y

If you can love, then you can defy
G R A V I T Y, G R A V I T Y
Good god

Gravity, the big G
G R A V I T Y, gravity, the big G
Gravity, the big G, G R A V I T Y, say it

Gravity, good god
Got a hold on me
Gravity
G are A V I T Y, gravity

Big G, G are A V I T Y
Gravity, gravity, G are A V I T Y, say it
Gravity, big G, gravity
