Even though you don't know
Even though you don't know
Even though you don't know my name
Me and you bleed exactly the same
I smile and come across all tame
A hundred volts take your life ain't no game
I switch them lights off
Hey DJ turn them lights off

She got my lights switched on
My lights switched on
She lookin' my eyes like I like this tone
I wanna know what side she's from
I seen many girls but I like this one
Told me she was a west side lady
Had a few friends but they were all shady
Now she on the solo team
So nobody can send her crazy
Too many friends and not enough true friends
Made her wanna go and move to new ends
I care though, 'cause even if my life gets lonely
It's all good, to keep few friends

We connected I asked her out and then she accept it
I think she gets it
When the end of the nights comes
Me and her leave for the exit

Even though you don't know my name
Me and you bleed exactly the same
I smile and come across all tame
A hundred volts take your life ain't no game
I switch them lights off
Oh DJ turn them lights off

Everywhere we go we about to have fun
You take care of me we get the job done
She keeps my mind calm, getting alot done
I know it's on me but I feel so alone
On first site, I wanted to be acquainted
People gonna see us out think that we are dating
And we don't know where we even wanna take it
But we got it good on I don't wanna break it

We connected I asked her out and then she accept it
I think she gets it
When the end of the nights comes
Me and her leave for the exit

Even though you don't know my name
Me and you bleed exactly the same
I smile and come across all tame
A hundred volts take your life ain't no game
I switch them lights off
Oh DJ turn them lights off

Turn the lights on, Beyonce
When you not cried ever I must say
I like the dimples on her face
Young black and a tat on her rip cage
That sexy dress the only part that's revealing yes
That's why I'm respecting her
Rejecting them and selecting her strength

Anywhere we go we bond to have fun
You take care of me we get the job done

I switch them lights off
Oh DJ turn them lights off

When the end of the nights comes
Me and her leave for the exit
