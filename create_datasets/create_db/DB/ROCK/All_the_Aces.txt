The only thing I know, is playing rock 'n' roll
I'm not a businessman, I'm just in a good time band
You don't let no-one know, just where the money goes
Because of parasites, I ain't got no rights
All the aces, all the aces, all the aces
I don't like people who ain't got no faces

You know I don't know why you have to be so sly
I found it hard to learn, I don't get what I earn
But you get your share, though you ain't nowhere
You get no wiser, but then I despise you
All the aces, all the aces, all the aces
I don't like people who ain't got no faces

You know you're the boss, but I'm the one it costs
Gotta see the books, you give me dirty looks
Yeah, you make me vomit, and I ain't far from it
You know you can rob me, but you can't stop me
All the aces, all the aces, all the aces
I don't like people who ain't got faces
