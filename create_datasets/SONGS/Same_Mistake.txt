Saw the world turning in my sheets
And once again, I cannot sleep
Walk out the door and up the street
Look at the stars beneath my feet
Remember rights that I did wrong
So here I go

Hello, hello
There is no place I cannot go
My mind is muddy but 
My heart is heavy, does it show?
I lose the track that loses me, so here I go

Oh ooh
Oh ooh
Oh ooh

And so I sent some men to fight
And one came back at dead of night
Said he'd seen my enemy
Said he looked just like me
So I set out to cut myself 
And here I go

Oh ooh
Oh ooh
Oh ooh

I'm not calling for a second chance
I'm screaming at the top of my voice
Give me reason, but don't give me choice
'Cause I'll just make the same mistake again

Oh ooh

And maybe someday we will meet
And maybe talk, and not just speak
Don't buy the promises, 'cause
There are no promises I keep
And my reflection troubles me
So here I go

Oh ooh
Oh ooh
Oh ooh

I'm not calling for a second chance
I'm screaming at the top of my voice
Give me reason, but don't give me choice
'Cause I'll just make 
The same mistake

I'm not calling for a second chance
I'm screaming at the top of my voice
Give me reason, but don't give me choice
'Cause I'll just make the same mistake again

Oh ooh
Oh ooh
Oh ooh
Oh ooh

Saw the world turning in my sheets (oh ooh)
And once again, I cannot sleep (oh ooh)
Walk out the door and up the street (oh ooh)
Look at the stars (ah ooh)
Look at the stars fall down (ah ooh)
And wonder where (ah ooh)
Did I go wrong?
