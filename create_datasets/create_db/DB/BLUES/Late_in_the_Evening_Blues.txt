it was late in the evening and the sun was going down
i would pray to the good lord 
to please bring my baby round
 yes i miss her more than even
to me she's the only one
i miss her more than ever
to me she's the only one
she'd be the on that..
when i need a faovr done
i hate to hear the raindrops beat against my window pane
i hate to hear the randrops beat against my window pane
i'm so blue without my baby
it's enought to drive old me insane
will i ever find my aby
she's the one i can't afford to lose
will i every find my baby
she's the on i can't afford to lose
i wake up early in the morning with the late in the evening blues
