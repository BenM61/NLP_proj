Manipulated
As a machine,
I keep on doing on and on the same thing
To put together these fucking devices
For ass holes at war ending up in slices

Death factory,
Killing machine,
Death factory,
Here comes my fury!

Conditioned,
No other choice, nothing else to do,
It's not easy to find work in my country
Forced to produce these fucking devices,
For brothers at war ending up in slices.

Death factory,
Killing machine,
Death factory,
Here comes my fury!

Machinery
