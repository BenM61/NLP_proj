"No making friends, no human contact with the Germans who by the war crimes
They have committed place themselves outside of the society of civilized nations"

"No making friends, no human contact with the Germans"
Micro-precision and heart full of steel
Strategic kindness, mechanic feel
Logical passion, pre-planned joy
Controlled madness, the world is just a toy

Concrete emotions, artificial tears
Dog-faced devotion, one thousand years
Perfuse perfection, dishonest smile
Malicious action, vicious and vile

Germaniac!
Mad in Germany
Germaniac!
To rule the world
Ha!

Micro-precision and heart made of steel
Strategic kindness, mechanic feel
Logical passion, pre-planned joy
Controlled madness, the world is just a toy

Compute emotions, artificial tears
Dog-faced devotion, one thousand years
Perfuse perfection, dishonest smile
Malicious action, vicious and vile

Germaniac!
"We are Lutheran, from Essen Germany, the Ruhr valley,
My father was long time a Krupp steelworker"

Invasions, visions for an insane mind
Carry power to threaten mankind
Faultless deduction, always correct
Preparing in secret, a beastly attack
