I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour
That's when my love comes tumbling down
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour
When there's no one else around

I'm gonna take you girl and hold you
And do all the things I told you
In the midnight hour, in the midnight hour
Yes, I am, oh, yes, I am

I'm gonna wait till the stars come out
And see that twinkle in your eyes
I'm gonna wait 'til the midnight hour
That's when my love begins to shine

You're the only girl I know
That really loves me so in the midnight hour
Oh, yeah, in the midnight hour
Yeah, alright, play it for me one time now

Just you and I, oh, baby, hah
Just you and I, nobody around, baby
Just you and alright, you know what?

I'm gonna hold you in my arms
Just you and I, oh yeah, in the midnight hour
Oh, baby, in the midnight hour
