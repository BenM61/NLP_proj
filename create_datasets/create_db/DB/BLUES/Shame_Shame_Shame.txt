Shame, shame, shame on you Miss Roxy
Shame, shame, shame on you Miss Roxy
Shame, shame, shame 'bout what you've done

You made me sweat and talk till I was skin and bones
You cause your lovers grief oh look at me now

Shame, shame, shame on you Miss Roxy
Shame, shame, shame on you Miss Roxy
Shame, shame, shame 'bout what you've done

Well, I was offered the dice, I didn't touch the gin
And then the dam broke loose, oh, you was the reason

Shame, shame, shame on you Miss Roxy
Shame, shame, shame on you Miss Roxy
Shame, shame, shame 'bout what you've done

And now you want me back, well I can tell you plain
You gonna heed my words, down on your knees, girl

Shame, shame, shame on you Miss Roxy
Shame, shame, shame on you Miss Roxy
Shame, shame, shame 'bout what you've done
