You're a mean mistreatin' mama, you mistreat me all the time
You're a mean mistreatin' mama, you mistreat me all the time
I tried to tell you how much I loved you
But you don't pay that no mind

You're a mean mistreatin' mama, and you don't mean me no good
You're a mean mistreatin' mama, and you don't mean me no good
I don't blame you baby
I'd be here the same way if I could

Can you remember baby, when I knocked upon your door
Can you had the nerve to tell me that you didn't want me no more
Remember baby, when I knocked upon your door
You had the nerve to tell me that you didn't want me no more
Oh, yeah

Ain't it lonesome sleeping all by yourself
When the woman you've been lovin' is in love with someone else
Ain't it lonesome, baby, sleepin' by yourself
When the woman you've been lovin' is in love with someone else

You're a mean mistreatin' mama, you mistreat me all the time
You're a mean mistreatin' mama, you mistreat me all the time, oh yeah
I tried to tell you how much I loved you
But you don't pay that no mind
Ah, let's go
