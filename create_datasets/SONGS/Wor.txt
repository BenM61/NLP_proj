Raise the phone
And drop it on the zone
To call you had to stip me to the bone

Don't slam the door
Wait out deep in hell
Took a chance on you and it's time to ring the bell

Side effects
Have you walking in a daze
Another fall out from this thing just radiates

You'll be the first
I'll always be the last
I'll duck and cover 'till the threat is past

Make your move now and try to win the game
But in the end it always stays the same
Don't shy away behind those lost in lines
I read between them almost every time

Hold the fight
It's all I'm asking for
But the aftershock just shook me to the girl

Flick the switch
And watch it all around
Best get out before 

Press the button now
And drop it on the zone
To call you and to strip me to the bone

Don't slam the door
Wait out deep in hell
Took a chance on you and it's time to ring the bell
