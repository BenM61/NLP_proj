I'm coming out of my wishing well
Where only echoes lonely hear m prayers
I'm coming around to bend cause my resistance been to persistent
I've come to far to force it so I'll watch it slide and land
I could come on strong and willful but
I'd rather watch it fall to the palm of my hand

And when I set it free like a feather it will be
And when I rise to see it done like whatever it will be it will be

I'm taking a breather baby
From sitting on pins waiting for my sky to fall
I'm taking up giving in
So here's the wheel, I'm putting my feet up
Take another look at me baby
Today I'm taking on catastrophe
I'd rather take it easy
Then try to force what's on its way to me

And when I set it free like a feather it will be
And when I rise to see it done like whatever it will be it will be

We're only afraid if we pull back the blinds too far
The lights behind that we free will blind other stars
But the truth doesn't blind it helps to see far
So get ready to be
Who you are
