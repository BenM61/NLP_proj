Love is darkness blinded by the light
Let it lead you, listen for the cry
I will find you, every time I turn you're there
(You're there)

I have seen into the future
I want you to take me there
I have seen into the future
Every night I say a prayer
Every night I say a prayer

Hoping for forgiveness
We all make mistakes
I wanna walk beside you
I've gotta keep the faith

Now that I found you
Never gonna let you go

I have seen into the future
I want you to take me there
I have seen into the future
Every night I say a prayer
Every night I say a prayer

Oh, oh
Every night I say a prayer
Every night I say a prayer

Oh, oh
Every night I say a prayer
Every night I say a prayer

I know where we're going
I know where we're going

I have seen into the future
I want you to take me there
I have seen into the future
Every night I say a prayer
Every night I say a prayer

Oh, oh oh
Every night I say a prayer
Every night I say a prayer

Oh, oh oh
Every night I say a prayer
Every night I say a prayer

Oh, oh oh
I have seen into the future
I know where we're going
I know where we're going

Oh, oh oh
I want you to take me there
I know where we're going

Oh, oh oh
I have seen into the future
Every night I say a prayer
Every night I say a prayer

Oh, oh oh
I want you to take me there
Every night I say a prayer
Every night I say a prayer

Oh, oh oh
I have seen into the future
I know where we're going
I know where we're going
