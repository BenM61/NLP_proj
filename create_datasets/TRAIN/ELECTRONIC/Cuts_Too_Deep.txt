Daylight, slowly creeping through the crack in the curtains
And it suddenly reminded me I didn't sleep allnight.
It's just the thought of you I'll swear,
Lyin' in the fatal position,

How can I sleep?
How can I sleep when it cuts too deep?
It cuts too deep.

Take a handfull of magic,
Weigh it up on the scales
Of the wrong place, the wrong time
Take one body of a memory
Of a bright bright eyes
I can't erase from my mind

Oh, take one girl who said yeah
I can handle it, in the voice of a child.
Does that child weep?
Does that weep,
No it cuts too deep,
It cuts too deep

Yeah well, I've cried in the morning
And I've cried at night,
I've stamped on the pain of too much longing
I've cried in the morning
And I've cried at night
Now it' all done
Now it's all done.

All the dreams I've dreamed
I shall dream again eternally speaking
Just now the face of eternity
Looks blank into the face of time

It's just the thought of you
Lying in that naked position
Oh, how could I speak?
How could I speak when it cuts too deep
It cuts too deep
Oh, it cuts too deep

It cuts too deep...
