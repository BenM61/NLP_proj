Standing on the corner of rhythm and blues
A Valentino smile gave me my first clue
Tell me girl, I wonder can you spare me some time
He said, I mean more than just your nine to five

Love at first sight I thought so
Or maybe it was the clock
That led me to his passion
It was not "pillow talk"

When he taught me to spell disaster
I hollered someone save me

There's been a robbery, somebody please
I'm gonna put out an A.P.B, a love thievery
There's been a robbery, somebody please
I'm gonna put out an A.P.B, a love thievery

Save me, save me, save me, save me, save me, save me, save me

He was Poitier and Gable all rolled into one man
A Marlon Brando voice, played me to his hand
Sweet words not just saccharin
But the pure sugarcane
Confection surely drips
When he speaks my name

Love at first sight I thought so
Or maybe it was the clock
That led me to his passion
It was not "pillow talk"

When he taught me to spell disaster
I hollered someone save me

There's been a robbery, somebody please
I'm gonna put out an A.P.B, a love thievery
There's been a robbery, somebody please
I'm gonna put out an A.P.B, a love thievery

Save me, save me, save me, save me, save me, save me, save me, save me, save me

Someone save me
He's gonna get me

Robbery
A.P.B
Robbery
A.P.B
Save me
A.P.B
Robbery
A.P.B

Please, somebody please, there's been a robbery
He's got my heart and love baby, baby
Somebody please, there's been a robbery
I'm gonna put out an A.P.B
Somebody please, there's been a robbery
He's got my heart and love baby, baby
Somebody please, there's been a robbery
I'm gonna put out an A.P.B
Somebody please
