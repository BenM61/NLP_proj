I'm tired of broken street glass. 
Not gettin' no ass unless the babies sleep. 
But even then it seems like we're tryin' to keep. 
Tired of payin' taxes, sendin' me mails and faxes.
Tired of crook cops. 
Tired of black folk complain that crime don't stop. 
I want to go to  a place where lovers go. 
Do the things that lovers do.
No stress. 
A sweet caress from me to you. 
I want to do the things we used to do. 
Say the things we used to say.
Just like everyday, all day.
Far away from here
Far away from here
Far away from here
Just jump in a taxi cab, pack our bag and get away fast.
Far away from here
Far away from here
Far away from here
Just jump in a taxi cab, pack our bag and get away fast.
Tired of late sub waitress. 
Tired of undeserved fame.
Tired of watchin' somethin' on the T.V. doin' nothin'
Doin' nothin'
I'd rather be lookin' at ya.
I'd rather be layin' with ya
I don't want to forget all the love we captured the day we met.
I want to go to a place where lovers go.
Do the things that lovers do.
No Stress.
No
A sweet caress from me to you. 
I want to do the things we used to do.
Say the things we used to say.
Just lay everyday , all day
Far away from here
Far away from here
Far away from here
Just jump in a taxi cab, pack our bag and get away fast.
Far away from here
Far away from here
Far away from here
Just jump in a taxi cab, pack our bag and get away fast.
Far away from here
Far away from here
Far away from here
Just jump in a taxi cab, pack our bag and get away fast.
Far away from here
Far away from here
Far away from here
Just jump in a taxi cab, pack our bag and get away fast.
Far away from here 
Far away from here
Far away from here
Just jump in a taxi cab, pack our bag and get away fast.
Far away from here
Far away from here
Far away from here
Just jump in a taxi cab, pack our bag and get away fast.
