When I saw you at the grocery store
You were sharing a shopping cart with her
And I couldn't turn and run away
I didn't know what to say
You introduced us for the first time
And I had to look her in the eye
But you could not imagine my surprise
Can't you see you're leaving me for an ugly girl

Does she talk politics and all the stuff that used to make me sick
Does she smoke cigars and stay up late oh, she's so great
Does she tell you what you want to hear
And I bet that she can grow a beard
I'd feel better thinking you were queer
It's not fair I can't compare to an ugly girl

Ha ha ha, the joke's on me
I feel jealous and I feel mean
Is she so nice that it makes up for her face there's no way
Do you have to keep your eyes closed
Do you have to keep the lights down low
Oh I bet you wish you had a blindfold can't you see
You're leaving me for an ugly girl
