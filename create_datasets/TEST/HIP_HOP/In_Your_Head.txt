She's waiting for her man to go to work
Then calls me on the phone saying he's such a jerk
I feel like a thief in the day and a thief in the night
But it's just a fight
Why why why don't he treat you right
He should be the one to apologize
We're going upstairs, then the phone rings I hear your husband ask
"Is someone in the back, who's that who's that who's that who's that"

In your head
In your head
Mohombi
Mohombi
Mohombi
Who's in your head
In your head
Mohombi
Mohombi
Mohombi

He ain't falling for your lies
He got a private eye
But I pass him in the sky
He's tryna look through your blinds
What is your report to your man
Is he really should have listened while he had that chance

You told him what you like and what you hate
And now I stole your heart and it's way too late
You really really didn't have the business
Now I'm all up all up all up in your business
Now you know who this is
Fulfilling all your wishes

In your head
In your head
Mohombi
Mohombi
Mohombi
Who's in your head
In your head
Mohombi
Mohombi
Mohombi

Just say my name
Just say my name
I feel your pain right
I feel your pain right

Told the girl to be quiet quiet
If they hear your voice they'll be a riot riot
Your man's outside with them dudes waiting
