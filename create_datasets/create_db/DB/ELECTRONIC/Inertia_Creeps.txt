Recollect me darling, raise me to your lips
Two undernourished egos, four rotating hips
Hold on to me tightly, I'm a sliding scale
Can't endure, then you can inhale clearly 
Out of body experience interferes
And dreams of flying, I fit nearly
Surrounds me, though I get lonely slowly

Moving up slowly, inertia keeps
She's moving up slowly, slowly
Moving up slowly, inertia creeps
Moving up slowly, she comes
Moving up slowly, she comes
Moving up slowly, inertia creeps
Moving up slowly, she comes
Moving up slowly, she comes, moving up slowly

In my home no chrome as clear as
See me now with my nearest dearest
Been there when I'm over careering
Room shifting is endearing
Between us is our kitchen
Would you found my irritant's itching
Been here before
Been here forever

Moving up slowly, inertia keeps
Moving up slowly, inertia creeps
Moving up slowly, inertia keeps
Moving up slowly, she comes
Moving up slowly, moving up slowly
She comes, moving up slowly
Inertia creeps, moving up slowly

She comes
There be no sound in my eidertown
Awake I lie in a morning's blue
Room is still my antenna in you
Nylon burns the bedspread with two
Gravity's zero see me stall
I bounce off walls lose my footing and fall
It can be sweet though incomplete though
And the frames will freeze
See me on all four's
It's been a long time

She comes, she comes

I want to x you, she comes
I want to x you, she comes

I caught your radio waves
I caught your radio waves
Will you take a string
Say you string me along
Say you string me along
Say inertia creeps
Inertia creeps and she comes
Say she comes, say she comes
Say she comes, say she comes
