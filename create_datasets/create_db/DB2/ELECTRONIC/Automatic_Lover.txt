Love in space and time
There's no more feeling
Automatic lover
Cold and unappealing

Longing to be touched
Loging for a kiss
Whisper words of love
Tell me that you miss

See me, feel me, hear me
Love me, touch me
See me, feel me, hear me
Love me, touch me

I can see you
See me, feel me, hear me
Love me, touch me
See me, feel me, hear me

Love me, touch me
I can see you
Nothing to caress not a hand to hold
I don't need the touch

'Cause his body's cold
He's programmed to receive
Automatic satisfaction
After love is done

Where's the true reaction
See me, feel me, hear me
Love me, touch me
I can hold you

See me, feel me, hear me
Love me, touch me
I can feel you
See me, feel me, hear me

Love me, touch me
I just want to make love
See me, feel me, hear me
Love me, touch me

Oh I need you
See me, feel me, hear me,
Love me, touch me
Your body's cold

There's not a hand to hold
