I got a ticket to ride 
I got a ticket to ride 
And I got you by my side 
And I got you by my side 

Wherever you wanna go
Whatever you wanna do
I got my arms open wide
Keepin' something from you

I got a ticket to ride
I got a ticket to ride 
And I got you by my side
And I got you by my side oh

We gotta move we got nothing to lose
We got it better, we got it better
We got it better, we got it better
And it's true

Easy come and it's easy go
I fell in love with the girl you know
I fell in love with the girl you know

I got a ticket to ride 
I keep the demon inside
And with a blink of an eye 
We ? and goodbye

We were to fallin' behind 
And now lettin' 'em leave
When I got what she wants
And she's got what I need oh

We got it better, we got it better
We got it better, we got it better
And it's true

Got it better, we got it better
We got it better, we got it better
We got it better, we got it better
And it's true

Easy come and it's easy go
I fell in love with the girl you know
I fell in love with the girl you know
I fell in love with the girl you know
