There's this emptiness I carry around with me
Just like a hole that you will never see
I wander in the sun, but it's cold inside of me
I'm a monkey in the zoo, but someone cut my tree
Hey God, if you're really up there and I'm not alone
Just do me a favor, bring me home! Just do me a favor, bring me home!
My oversize bedroom appears so small without you

I've tried it all from pills to gin, but haven't found the clue
It's like someone has locked the door so I can't get through
To where the emptiness is wiped away by you
Hey God, if you're really up there and I'm not alone,
Just do me a favor, bring me home! Just do me a favor, bring me home!
Just do me a favor?! Bring me home! Just do me a favor, bring me home!
Just do me a favor, bring me home! Just do me a favor, bring me home!
Just do me a favor, bring me home! Bring me home!
