You can pretend you don't miss me (me)
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (me) 
Oh what a shame I'm not there
You can pretend you don't miss me (me)
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (me)
Oh what a shame I'm not there

What is it you want?
You can lie but I know that you're not fine (oh yeah)
Every time you talk
You talk 'bout me but you swear I'm not on your mind

You can pretend you don't miss me (me)
You can pretend you don't care 
All you wanna do is kiss me (me)
Oh what a shame I'm not there

Everybody knows
You and I are suicidal stolen art (oh yeah)
Pretty moments sews
Stitches into all your bitches broken hearts

You can pretend you don't miss me (me)
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (me)
Oh what a shame I'm not there

Somebody new
Is gonna comfort you
Like you want me to
Somebody new
Is gonna comfort me
Like you never do

Every now and then it hits me
That I'm the one that got away
But I guess being lonely fits me
And you were made for begging, stay
