Music makes me sing
Goodbye sadness
Hello happiness
Music makes me sing
Goodbye sadness
Hello happiness

Music makes me sing
Goodbye silence
Hello happiness (hello!)
Music makes me sing
Goodbye silence (I'm so happy, yeah)
Hello happiness

It moves my body
Yet frees my mind
There ain't no question
Ooh, it makes me high
If you're feelin' unsure
I've got your cure
This music is yours
And this beat is mine (hello)

It moves my body
Yet frees my mind
There ain't no question (I'm so happy)
Ooh, it makes me high
If you're feelin' unsure
I've got your cure
This music is yours
And this beat is mine

Music makes me sing
Goodbye silence (Hello happiness)
Hello happiness
Music makes me sing
Goodbye silence (Make you dance, baby)
Hello happiness (I wanna dance tonight)

Music makes me sing
Goodbye silence
Hello happiness

Take me back to the dance floor
So I can dance away my blues
Love is what I'm here for
So don't give me no bad news
Take me back to the dance floor
So I can dance away my blues
Love is what I'm here for
So don't give me no bad news

It moves my body
Yet frees my mind (Goodbye!)
There ain't no question (Goodbye, sadness)
Ooh, it makes me high
If you're feelin' unsure
I've got your cure (I wanna dance, wanna dance)
This music is yours (Wanna dance, wanna dance)
And this beat is mine

It moves my body
Yet frees my mind
There ain't no question
Ooh, it makes me high (To the dance, to the dance floor)
If you're feelin' unsure (To the dance floor, baby)
I've got your cure
This music is yours
And this beat is mine

(I can dance away my blues)
Dance away my blues
I wanna dance away my blues

Music makes me sing
Goodbye sadness
Hello happiness
