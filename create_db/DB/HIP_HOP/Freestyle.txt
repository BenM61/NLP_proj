Tony touch Iraq Iraq  50 M-C's,
A little bit a thugs is all it takes 
To make this industry just brake 
A little bit a thugs is all it takes 
To make this industry just brake 
What  what  what poison arrows 
Swords and lords  yo  but really 
My Mac Milly spray niggas lay niggas
Yo the cognac make you feel unbeatable 
Yo  especially  when that ass drunk too much 
I call up tony touch tony touch bring the next dutch 
Yo I'm all fucked up bent and can't think 
While you both stink, don't even care that you sink 
Yo impulsive, exclusive, high explosive 
Can't even get with, shit I dealt wit 
I'm on some other shit, my main script describe the foulness 
Panama canalness, what, yo, I, don't even talk so I'm far from the loudest 
Kid, nigga, can't touch this, rush this, yo what 
Yo, switch the beat, now, bless it

What, I'm bout to f*ck shit up, what 
F*ck it up
F*ck it up
F*ck it up
F*ck it up f*ck it up f*ck it up, what what!? 
We on the lines like the internet 
Many will come but few was chosen 
Against my set, there ain't a nigga yet 
Smoke so much niggas say I need nicorette 
You say boogie, but you used to say cigarette 
Now I know, a new religion, a new beginning 
I own women, three-fourths rock and linen 
This middle east shit, father beat shit 
Release this, the only place in the world, that pull out cracks pieces 
We rock camels, split that ass in text 
Yo we bag bitches after we f*ck em and say thanks 
Yo thanks for havin' me, next week your straight grabbin' me 
Swearin' they homeless, sayin' that the havin' me 
I don't, want to crawl at all 
You want to be a thug, you used to play ball 
Runs the play for Seton Hall 
Now, outta the blue, you got thug in you too 
Yo I knew you, your size shoe was due in voodoo
Always, smell like shit, used to call you doo-doo 
Never came outside, in the crib you hide 
Scared to death 
While we played manhunt, to our last breath 
I never chose this life, it chose me 
What, l-f-c, heavy amount with jewelry 
Crime syndicate, nigga livin' this 
Never mention miss ? 
Smoke rain bodies, you had to saw before, before 
Yo, you on my dick, I had the lime green on 
With the string on, with fatigue on 
Fresh avirex's, cockpit, now from the outlet 
Jose Luis emperor, two shots I blow ta Dillinger 
No real kings like john Dillinger, the politic 
What, I'm on some ides in the militant 
You either with me or against me 
That in between shit make the money stop too intensely 
So what the deal is, the generals what the deal is 
What the deal is, the devilish thought you can't kill this 

What niggas, Iraq, realize that
