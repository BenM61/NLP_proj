Who can you trust when you need to?
Why do we rust when we heed you?
Crashing back down to earth I've found
We can love

Oh, let me see
All of the places that I can be
Oh, let me know
All of the places where we can go

Do you ever think in bubbles?
Do you ever shake up troubles?
Falling apart right from the start
Crawling 'round

Oh, let me see
All of the places that I can be
Oh, let me know
All of the places where we can go

Show us how to stand up, strong
Waiting, for you takes so long
Shadows leave us standing naked
We can't fake it

Oh, let me see
All of the places that I can be
Oh, let me know
All of the places where we can go

Oh, let me see
All of the places that I can be
Oh, let me know
All of the places where we can go
