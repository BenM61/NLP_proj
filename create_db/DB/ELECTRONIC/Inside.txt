Break your stride when I'm walking
Steal your breath when I'm talking
Break your stride when I'm walking
Steal your breath when I'm talking
I have two eyes to see
I have two arms that help me feed
It doesn't stop me from loathing all I do
'Cause I'm taking taking taking taking
Break your stride when I'm walking
Steal your breath when I'm talking
Time she told me to try
You know I can't live with you inside
Haunt each day of my life
You know I can't live with you inside
And at night I'm just the same
Counting stars won't help me
Coping with my name
'Cause I'm taking taking taking taking
Break your stride when I'm walking
Steal your breath when I'm talking
Time she told me to try
You know I can't live with you inside
Haunt each day of my life
You know I can't live with you inside
I don't laugh at the television even
Break your stride when I'm walking
Steal your breath when I'm talking
Take your thirst when I'm drinking
Numb your brain when I'm thinking
Time she told me to try
You know I can't live with you inside
Haunt each day of my life
You know I can't live with you inside
Haunt each day of my life
You know I can't live with you inside
