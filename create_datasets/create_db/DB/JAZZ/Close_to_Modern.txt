You make a pretty fine memory oh
Once you find out next to me oh
Just in time now wait and see oh
If they're cryin' out for you or me
You want to live right over the time 
Gimme everything I know oh everything I know
You want to live right over the time
Gimme everything I know oh everything I know 
Close to modern close to modern
Oh you watch you're so pretty
And you never stop givin' 
Till we get lost every time
My baby don't ever stop hangin' on me
What I think of you we get lost every time
Woohoohoo ahhh [Repeat x8] 
Woohoohoo
