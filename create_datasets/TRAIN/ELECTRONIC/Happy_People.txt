I want to see more happy people
I want to see more happy people
Where are all those happy people?
I want to see more happy people
Happy peoples want to see more happy peoples
I want to see more happy people
Happy peoples want to see more happy peoples
Where are all those happy people?
Stand up, stand tall
It ain't right but it's still going on

Downstairs it needs to smash
The good vibrations vibrates the past
A new style, kid, a new format
A new technique and you're, "what's all of that?"
Ragga raps to beats commercial
Which it ain't personal, still write the verbal
I'll let you know straight from the get-go
How much the ghetto woman made Joe

Tired of living your life so sat down mitts up rapper
Pretty John, John come make you pretty fire burn
Live with John, John come make me chase the devil
Them belly full but we pay for hungry
Pretty knees shakin' make we live our way 
Talkin' to the commander-in-chief of the army
Mr. Bill Clinton and the bird Hillary
Wrap up the war on the brutality

I want to see more happy people
Happy peoples want to see more happy peoples
I want to see more happy people
Happy peoples want to see more happy peoples
Where are all those happy people?
Gotta stand up, gotta be strong
It ain't right but it's still going on

Still righteous, still positive
I've seen enough so you I gotta give
A share of taste of you believe me you kid 
I'm living proof that the street life may hide its propaganda
You wanna get what the men will come and hand you
And they'll send you a phoney drink
Find happiness and then you're the chief

Come and fly on your year
Come take a bite of this apple
Love and unity get a lil' comfortable
God take this state of emergency
The baby want fi live so happy and free
When I was a youth I used to see happiness
Now that I'm a man I see my people in a stress
What is it that dark must come to the light
Talkin' to the nation yes we're up to your night (get it)

I want to see more happy people
Happy peoples want to see more happy peoples
I want to see more happy people
Happy peoples want to see more happy peoples
Where are all those happy people?
Stand up, stand tall
It ain't right but it's still going on

I want to see more happy people
Happy peoples want to see more happy peoples
I want to see more happy people
Happy peoples want to see more happy peoples
Where are all those happy people?
Stand up, stand tall
It ain't right but it's still going on

I want to see more happy people
Happy peoples want to see more happy peoples
I want to see more happy people
Happy peoples want to see more happy peoples
Where are all those happy people?
Stand up, stand tall
It ain't right but it's still going on

I want to see more happy people
Happy peoples want to see more happy peoples
I want to see more happy people
Happy peoples want to see more happy peoples
Where
