I was thinking today if you would remember you choose to remember
What you left me out there in the cold days fading away
I see you so near I hear your voice calling
It calls me from these pages to you beyond the blue,
So sudden too soon the secrets we knew
I was thinking today if you would surrender to feelings
That you tried deserting and if given the choice
I'd still wait for the moment still wait for the moment
When I could have a hero like you days fading away
But I see you so clear I hear your voice calling
It calls me from these pages to you
