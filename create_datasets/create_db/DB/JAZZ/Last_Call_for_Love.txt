The moment has come, I hear a drum
Or is it my heart dear, beating this way
There's work to be done, done with a gun
There goes the bugle, I hear it say

It's the last call for love, time to say Fare thee well
Let the taps tell you all that my heart dare not tell

[Chorus:]
With your eyes in the stars of Old Glory
Can I help but be faithful to you
Till we meet on the day we're dreaming of
It's the last call for love

[Chorus]

It's the last call for love, sweetheart
