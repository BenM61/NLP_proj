Hu, oh, oh, oh
Woo, ah

Listen, how do I live without you
When every day that I open my eyes
And turn to my side gotta smile deep inside
'Cause the one who was there was you

And how do I focus at work
Every time my cell phone rings
Or a pager beeps, I'm so nervous so anxious
But hoping the caller is you

And how am I supposed to get sleep
When every night that I lay down my head in my bed
You ain't there with your arms wrapped around me
Holding me all night through

And how could this be fair
When I gave you all of my love
All my time every dime after spending still
You could walk out the door to explore

Another relationship
Is that what this is about
Another relationship
That you would leave your own house
For another relationship

Was that the straw that broke the camels back
Another relationship, another relationship
Baby, tell me what's up with that

What does she have on me
What does she do that is so damn good
That would make you give up all the love
All the trust and the stuff that you built with me

Does she know my name
Did you ever tell her that she was taking
And breaking the bond that we strengthened
Through blood sweat and tears over the years
Boy you don't hear me

And has she met your son
Or maybe your mother and father
Your sister, 2 brothers and all of your cousins
Your uncle who loves me and still call me

And how could this be
Tell me what's better than storming the weather
And staying together with the one you love
And have a history

Another relationship
How could you go to her Is that what this is about
Another relationship
How could you leave your own house

Another relationship
Was that the straw that broke the camels back
Another relationship, another relationship
(Baby tell me what's up with that, tell me)

I thought that we were so happy
(I thought we were so happy, baby)
How could you leave so easily
Is she worth all that baby, oh

Another relationship
Oh, how could you baby
Another relationship
Sacrifice our happy life
For Another relationship

And this wasn't what you promised me
Another relationship, another relationship
You said you would love me
Love me, love me, love me forever baby

Another relationship
So how come I wasn't good enough, oh
Another relationship
I know all relationships get tough, oh

For another relationship
How could you do this to me
Another relationship, another relationship
Oh, we're suppose to be building a family

Another relationship
Oh, why, why, why did you leave
Another relationship
So, so, so, so easily

Another relationship
And what the hell will I do now
Another relationship, another relationship
When I'm carrying your child
