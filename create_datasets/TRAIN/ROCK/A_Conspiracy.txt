Did you ever hear
The one about last year
It was all a lie
Ain't it funny how the time flies
What we gonna do baby
What is left for us to prove
I've never stolen nothing, not a thing
Tried to stay away from this year's
Big thing
Ain't as easy as it seems
To find a mutual dream

Can you tell me wrong from right
Do you know when to freeze or take flight
Can you tell me more or less
I got to know-confess

Don't neglect me
Come be my conspiracy
Don't neglect me
Come be my conspiracy

Now you got a question about your answer
Say try your Adam's apple
You talk it try it bite it right
So now you want to fight? OK
Let's step outside
I got tradition in addition
My definition it don't hold me back
Well what you think about that
What you don't understand
This is a very old land

Can you tell me wrong from right
Do you know when to freeze or take flight
Can you tell me more or less
I got to know-confess

Don't neglect me
Come be my conspiracy
Don't neglect me
Come be my conspiracy
