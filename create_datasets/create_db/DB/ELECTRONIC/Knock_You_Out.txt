My fight is won
Who needs a gun
Boom boom knock you out
You knocked me down
But who's laughing now
Boom boom knock you out
My fight is won
Who needs a gun
Boom boom knock you out
You knocked me down
But who's laughing now
Boom boom knock you out

You pick on the weak
Your twisted tongue speaks
All the fears you hide
The fear inside
You think I don't see
You're not talking to me
I'm the mirror, the knife
The fear inside

But I get stronger everyday
One wrong will be all it takes
My power's fed by your hate
One wrong will be all it takes

My fight is won
Who needs a gun
Boom boom knock you out
You knocked me down
But who's laughing now
Boom boom knock you out
My fight is won
Who needs a gun
Boom boom knock you out
You knocked me down
But who's laughing now
Boom boom knock you out

And the bully's best friend
Is the poison pen
But you can't touch me
While you sit at home
Plan attacks all alone
You try to phase me

But I get stronger everyday
One wrong will be all it takes
My power's fed by your hate
One wrong will be all it takes

My fight is won
Who needs a gun
Boom boom knock you out
You knocked me down
But who's laughing now
Boom boom knock you out

My fight is won
Who needs a gun
Boom boom knock you out
You knocked me down
But who's laughing now
Boom boom knock you out
