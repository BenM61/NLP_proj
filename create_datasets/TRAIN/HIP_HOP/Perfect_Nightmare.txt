Sometimes we fight
Sometimes I cry
Why don't I just tell him goodbye
Sometimes I should but
Sometimes I don't
Build up the strength to say that its wrong
Sometimes I hate, sometimes I love
Sometimes I hurt, sometimes I don't
Sometimes I wait for him to change
But its okay I just got to pay (yeah)

And I don,t ever wanna leave 'em alone
They say I'm brain washed but I'm in love with this man (yeahhh)

Keep tellin' myself that its not worth it
I already know I don't deserve it
But if its from you I don't mind hurting
This is my perfect nightmare
So when will I wake up and scream

No way, no way, no way, no way, no way, no way, no way
But if its from you I don mind hurting
This is my perfect nightmare (perfect nightmare)

Sometimes I keep it cool
Sometimes I let 'em know, sometimes I even pack my bags to walk out the door
Sometimes I feel safe
Sometimes I really don't
Sometimes I promise that I'm ready to let 'em go
But I don't ever wanna leave 'em alone
They say I'm brainwashed but I'm in love with this man (ooooh)

Keep tellin' myself that its not worth it
I already know I don't deserve it
But if its from you I don't mind hurting
This is my perfect nightmare
So when will I wake up and scream

No way, no way, no way, no way, no way, no way, no way
But if its from you I don mind hurting
This is my perfect nightmare (perfect nightmare)

Hopin' hes changing but I'm scared hes not cant see a way to leave him
He open'd my eyes and I

Keep tellin' myself that its not worth it
I already know I don't deserve it
But if its from you I don't mind hurting
This is my perfect nightmare
So when will I wake up and scream

No way, no way, no way, no way, no way, no way, no way
But if its from you I don't mind hurting
This is my perfect nightmare (perfect nightmare)

Keep tellin' myself that its not worth it
I already know I don't deserve it
But if its from you I don't mind hurting
This is my perfect nightmare
So when will I wake up and scream 

No way, no way, no way, no way, no way, no way, no way
But if its from you I don mind hurting
This is my perfect nightmare (perfect nightmare)

No way, no way, no way, no way, no way, no way, no way
But if its from you I don mind hurting
This is my perfect nightmare (perfect nightmare)
