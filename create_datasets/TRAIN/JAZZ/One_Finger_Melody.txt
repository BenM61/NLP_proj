Yum dida dida, I love to play this melody,
Yum dida dida, the melody you sang to me.
Here beside my piano, I linger,
Picking out a memory with just one finger.

Yum dida dida, the music brings me close to you,
Maybe if I play it long enough it will come true,
Now you're far away and I'm alone and so I play
Yum dida dida, da yum dida dida, all day.

Yum dida dida, the music brings me close to you,
Maybe if I play it long enough it might come true,
Now you're far away and I'm alone and so I play

Yum dida dida, da yum dida dida, all day.
(Yum dida dida da ooo, yum dida dida da ooo)
Yum dida dida, da ooo.
