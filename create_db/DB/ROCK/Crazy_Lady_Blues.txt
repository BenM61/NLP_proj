Missed the morning too, didn't rise before noon.
She's a lazy lady today.
Always yawning, you with your eyes on the moon.
You're a crazy lady I'd say, da da da.

Now should I say more, for I know so well
And you're no hazy maiden in grey.
How can I be sure, it's not easy to tell.
But you're a crazy lady, I'd say.
Crazy lady.
