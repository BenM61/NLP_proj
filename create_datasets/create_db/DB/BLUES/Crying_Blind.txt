Don't know why ya look so good ta me
I don't know why ya look so good ta me
You, I want an' you won't even look at me

I see ya ev'ryday and you just pass me by
I see ya ev'ryday and you just pass me by
It's you I want, I want to hang my head an' cry

Cryin' so bad, has got me goin' blind
Cryin' so bad, has got me goin' blind
You know I love you, baby, so come on an' change your mind

(I hear ya' boy)
