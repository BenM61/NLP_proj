Baby girl, I want to tell you real quick
I'm not your average kind of brother tryin' to be slick
I want something real
Something my heart can feel
But you told me that your heart again you'll never reveal

Let me change your mind, change your mind 
Change your mind, 'cause I'm qualified
Let me change your mind, change your mind 
Change your mind, 'cause I'm qualified

Baby girl, are ready for this?
Let me lay this lovin' on you like a whip
Don't you know, I want to be in your midst
Want to be the jam you pick all night--your favorite hit

Let me change your mind, change your mind 
Change your mind, 'cause I'm qualified
Let me change your mind, change your mind 
Change your mind, 'cause I'm qualified
