The midnight oyster bellies bug you
From inside you want to scream
The comic cut is your arrival
Your reflections are obscene

Well you're looking for another end
Doing time
But you still can't turn away
Well you're looking for a real friend
Any kind
That wants to play the games you play

On this side of paradise
You're never going to go through twice
Stay tuned at any price
To this side of paradise

Cylinder dreams passing in stages
Lethargic grins left to bare
Broadway windows cubical cages
Where escape is fairly rare

Well you're looking for another end

Any Time
But you still can't turn away
Well you're looking for a real friend
Any kind
That wants to play the games you play

On this side of paradise
You're never going to go through twice
Stay tuned at any price
To this side of paradise

You've got to keep yourself well amused
Pay no attention to the faulty news
Set yourself on automatic cruise
Sometimes you just got to lose

On this side of paradise
You're never going to go through twice
Stay tuned at any price
To this side of paradise

On this side of paradise
On this side of paradise
