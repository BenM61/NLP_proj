In the city of lost and found
Mean it from my broken down
You light the flame, light this flame of love, baby

Dreams are made for you and me
No one wants you if you'll be the losing guy
Come on and take my hand
Come on, come on and take my hand

Like a hurricane is coming tonight
Tonight my love is just on your side
You break my heart boy
My heart boy, tonight

Like a hurricane is coming tonight
Tonight my young heart's beating, that's right
You break my heart boy
My heart boy, tonight

You're living in a world of broken dreams
It's your time to pull the strings
You light the flame, light the flame of love, baby

Dreams are made for you and me
No one wants you if you'll be the losing guy
Come on and take my hand
Come on, come on and take my hand

Like a hurricane is coming tonight
Tonight my love is just on your side
You break my heart boy
My heart boy, tonight

Like a hurricane is coming tonight
Tonight my young heart's beating, that's right
You break my heart boy
My heart boy, tonight

Like a hurricane is coming tonight
Tonight my love is just on your side
You break my heart boy
My heart boy, tonight
