Now, if you're think that I'm lookin' somewhat tanner
Don't go blamin' it on the sun
It's the moonlight and the sweetness in your manner
That's makin' me the healthy one

When the moon hangs low, I begin to glow
And my day has just begun
I'm gonna get a moonburn when I'm with you tonight
So very soon, I'll moonburn when you hold me tight

I'll ask the glowing stars up above me
What your lips will impart
And when they flash the word that you love me
You know it's gonna warm my heart

I'll get a brand new moonburn
With every kiss from you
And if I have my way, get my say
You'll get a moonburn too

Oh, I'm catchin' me some moonburn
When I get you alone with me tonight
So very soon, I'll moonburn when you hold me tight

I'll ask the glowing stars up above me
Tell me what your lips will impart
And when they flash the word that you love me
Ooh, it'll warm my heart

I'm gonna get me a brand new kind of a moonburn
With every kiss I get from you
And if I get my way, get my say, you'll get a moonburn too
Keep under cover, you'll get a moonburn too
