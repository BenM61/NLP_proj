There's so much wrong in your life 
And you wish you could turn back time
No time for sorrow, no time to regret
You're drowning in the sands of time

But life goes on day by day
And all the faults will remain

You walk away
You walk away
From the place you left before without me
There is nothing, that will make you stay

You walk away
You walk away
From the place you left before
You won't go back, 'cause there's nothing more for you to say

Oh, oh, oh, oh

You keep all the memories in your heart
You know they will keep you from be a tree
You walk with the devil deep inside
As long as you're not able to forget

But life goes on day by day
And all the faults will remain

You walk away
You walk away
From the place you left before without me
There is nothing, that will make you stay

You walk away
You walk away
From the place you left before
You won't go back, 'cause there's nothing more for you to say

Oh
Oh
You walk away
You walk away

You walk away
You walk away
From the place you left before without me
There is nothing, that will make you stay

You walk away
You walk away
From the place you left before
You won't go back, 'cause there's nothing more for you to say

You walk away
