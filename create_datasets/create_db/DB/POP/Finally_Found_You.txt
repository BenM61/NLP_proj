You know I'm gon get ya, yeah
Whatever it takes to get there
No I won't drop you
Like everybody else does

Forget about your friends, they don't care where we go
If they do, we'll get lost in a crowd of people
I've been looking for you forever baby we go
Together baby we go, we go

In this crazy world of choices I've only got a few
Either you're coming with me, or I'm coming with you
Cause I finally found, I finally found you
You never have to worry if what I say is true
Girl I've been looking for you and when I saw you I knew
That I finally found, I finally found you

I'm coming, I'll get ya, yeah
We have a connection, that's right
Cause girl I'm not letting go
I'm gonna make you feel right, oh yeah

Forget about your friends, they don't care where we go

Girl I've been looking for you and when I saw you I knew
That I finally found, I finally found you

I finally found, I finally found you

Yeah, so can I get love
Too much to ask for really so tough
Find yourself moving with the sex of the drums
Got my hands full, grabbin' all these girls, girls
Hands up, hands up
Dance floor chillin' while I hold two cups
Can't stop spilling, cause I'm drunk as f*ck
And my song comes on, and the club goes nuts
Yeah, every province I go, city I sleep, it's best that ya'll know
Running around, and doing all these shows
Round the whole globe, I come, and you go girl
And you need to think of it
Just arrive for the night, baby live a bit
With a place to hit, and your pants to zip
We can make this thing a party, are you into it

In this crazy world of choices I've only got a few
Either you're coming with me, or I'm coming with you
Cause I finally found, I finally found you

Finally, finally, finally found you
Finally, finally, finally found
Finally found, I finally found you

You know I'm go get ya, yeah
