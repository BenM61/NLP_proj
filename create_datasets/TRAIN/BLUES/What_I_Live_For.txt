So you say that this is it
You're just gonna leave
And take away all the little things that I need
Now wait just one minute
It's my life, babe and I want you in it
You are, baby, you are what I live for

Now sometimes I get bitter
But ain't that just like a man?
And sometimes I don't give all that I can
But your sweetness, baby, is what I crave
And this thing we've got, I'd like to save
You are, baby, you are what I live for

I know that everything
Can't always go as planned
But baby, baby, baby, I'm holdin' out my hand
So take a hold and come on in
The cold outside got me shiverin'
You are, baby, you, you are what I live for now
