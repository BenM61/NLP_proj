(You don't understand, I ain't scared of you mutha fuckas) (kick it!)

(Stir it like coffee)
The Pope
(Stir it like muthafuckin' coffee)
The Pope
(The hell)
This is the Pope

Oh, your car got mags that be dippy dippy dope
But the whole damn nation got the same
Honey only flock to the bee that's the Pope 
Not the President with government lame

Put me on a slow movin' parlimentary hackin' bandwagon 
You could put me little ass in the grave 
Every time you want it I'll be live, bring a date 
I mean computer when its over press save

So, you can be the President (you can be the President) (kick it)
I'd rather be the Pope (rather be the Pope) 
(I'd rather be, so happy)
Yeah you can be the side effect (you can be the side effect)
I'd rather be the dope (rather be the dope)
(I ain't scared of you mutha fuckers) (kick it)

Call your girl named Sally and you figure you were chill (chill) 
Then you find out I'm the reason Sally's on the pill (pill)
What am I supposed to do when the President can't get nothing passed
Find an alley, find an alley
Undress Sally right in front of your ass
(Well she helped me once again)

I say, you can be the President (you can be the President) (kick it)
I'd rather be the Pope (rather be the Pope)
(I'd rather be, so help me)
Yeah you can be the side effect (you can be the side effect)
I'd rather be the dope (rather be the dope) 
(F*ck that)
The Pope
(Oh no motherfucker, not today)

Pope
You can be the President (rather be the Pope)
So help me

Who's the funky drummer with the crooked little sticks (sticks)
He might have better luck if he was drummin' with his dick (dick?)
If you don't play the piccolo, why you want to lick?
(Ch-check) Now check the drum solo and tell me not to kick it

(Seek and destroy. It'll f*ck you up)

I love the taste of unpredictable licks

A loop is a loop is a loop
A loop is a loop is a loop (f*ck that)
A loop is a loop is a loop is a loop is a loop is a loop is a loop

Your car got mags that be dippy dippy dope
But the whole damn nation got the same
Honey only flock to the bee that's the Pope 
Not the President with government lame

Put me on a slow movin' parliamentary hackin' bandwagon 
You could put me little ass in the grave
Every time you want it I'll be live, bring a date 
I mean computer, when its over press save

(So) So you can be the president (you can be the President) (kick it)
I'd rather be the Pope (rather be the Pope) 
(I want to be, so happy)
You can be the side effect (you can be the side effect)
I'd rather be the dope (you, you, you) (you can be the dope)
The Pope

You can be the President (f*ck that)
Rather be the Pope
Baby, so help me please

Press save
I love you
Peace
(You don't understand), ho
