Well today I'm so weary today I'm so blue
Sad and broken hearted and it's all because of you
Life was so sweet dear life was a song
Now you've gone and left me oh where do I belong
And it's all for the love of a dear little girl
All for the love that sets your heart in a whirl
I'm a man who'd give his life and the joys of this world all for the love of a girl

And it's all for the love
