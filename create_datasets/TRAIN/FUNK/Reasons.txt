Now, I'm craving your body, is this real
Temperatures rising, I don't want to feel
I'm in the wrong place to be real
Woah and I'm longing to love you, just for a night
Kissing and hugging and holding you tight
Please let me love you, with all my might

Reasons, the reasons that we hear
The reasons that we fear
Our feelings a won't disappear, ooh
And after the love game has been played
All our illusions were just a parade
And all the reasons start to fade

La, la, la, la

After all our reasons why
All the reasons were a why
After all the reasons love was left aside

I'm longing to love you for one night
Please let me love you with all of my might, baby
Ooh baby

Reasons, the reasons that we hear
The reasons that we fear
Our feelings a won't disappear
And after the love games have been played
All our illusions were just a parade
And all the reasons start to fade

And, in the morning when I rise
No longer feeling hypnotized
For no reasons, our reasons, our reasons
Have no pride

After all the reasons why
All of the reasons were a lie
After all the reasons why love was left aside

Heeh, ah, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh baby

I can't find the reasons
That my love won't disappear
Can't find the reasons
Why I love you, my baby, my dear
Can't find the reasons
Wanna love you all night
Can't find the reasons
Gotta squeeze ya, real tight
Can't find the reasons
Baby yeah
For my tears
Can't find the reasons
