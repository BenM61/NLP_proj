Tell me is it really true 
This feelin' that I feel for you 
Your own kind of lovin' that makes me think 
Nothing could ever take the place of you 

And it's so funny funny 
What you do, honey, honey 
What you do, what you mean to me 
And you know, honey, honey 
Though it's so funny funny 
That you mean all the world to me 

Ever since you came my way 
I knew it was my lucky day 
The sun started shinin' when you started smiling 
And I know it's gonna stay that way 

And it's so funny funny 
What you do, honey, honey 
What you do, what you mean to me 
And you know, honey, honey 
Though it's so funny funny 
That you mean all the world to me 

Can't imagine lovin' anyone but you 
(Honey honey, so funny funny) 
Every minute lovin' everything you do 
(Honey honey, so funny funny) 
Couldn't see my way without you 
Now I gotta tell the world about you 

Tell me is it really true 
This feelin' that I feel for you 
Your own kind of lovin' that makes me think 
Nothing could ever take the place of you 

And it's so funny funny 
What you do, honey, honey 
What you do, what you mean to me 
And you know, honey, honey 
Though it's so funny funny 
That you mean all the world to me

And it's so funny funny 
What you do, honey, honey 
What you do, what you mean to me 
And you know, honey, honey 
Though it's so funny funny 
That you mean all the world to me

And it's so funny funny 
What you do, honey, honey 
What you do, what you mean to me
