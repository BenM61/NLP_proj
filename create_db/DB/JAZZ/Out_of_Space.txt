From out of space there came a rainbow above 
From out of space you came to me one day, my love 
Across the moon there came a dark cloud in view 
And all too soon, now here am I but where are you? 
I tried to reach you when dusk is falling 
I seem to see you, hear you, calling... 
Your lovely face was like a vision above 
From out of space, oh please, 
Come back to me, my love!
