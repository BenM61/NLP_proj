So we meet again
after several years
several years of separation
moving on
moving around

Did we spend this time chasing the other's tail?
Singing
Ohohohoh, I could never belong to you
Ohohohoh, I could never belong to you

Winter and spring
Summer and fall
You're the wind surfer crossing the ocean and the boat behind
Skiffle and rag, shuffle and waltz
You're the up tip toe ballerina in the chorus line:
Singing
Ohohohoh, I could never belong to you
Ohohohoh, I could never belong to you

River and sea, picking up salt
Through the air there's a fluffly cloud falling down as rain
Ohohohoh, I could never belong to you
Ohohohoh, I could never belong to you - oohooh
I could never belong to you -ooh ooh
I could never belong to you -ooh ooh
