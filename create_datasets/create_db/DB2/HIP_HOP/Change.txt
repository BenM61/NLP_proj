Always cold
While you'd self-incriminate
By avoiding all my questions
And calling me an instigator
Cut me down
Always calling me unstable
You so easily can make me cry
Just cause you are in a mood
And you'd say

Call me out
You would say I need attention
Just because I put on makeup
To ironically look good for you
Cut me to pieces
While you watched me disintegrate
Because you like to tell me how you hate
All the ways I'm not enough for you
Then you'd say

Baby don't go
I didn't know
I'll change I swear
I'll change I swear
Baby don't go
I'll make you wait
I promise I'll be better
All of these things they will change

Baby don't go
I didn't know
I'll change I swear
I'll change I swear
Baby don't go
I'll make you wait
I promise I'll be better
All of these things they will change

Never guilty
Say it ain't your fault
Because you had an emotionally abusive daddy
And cause of this you don't know how to act

Poor poor baby
Say you can't help the fact that you're so crazy
And you're so good at making me feel guilty
For trying to walk away
Because I'm tired of being mad
Then you'd say

Baby don't go
I didn't know
I'll change I swear
I'll change I swear
Baby don't go
I'll make you wait
I promise I'll be better
All of these things they will change

Baby don't go
I didn't know
I'll change I swear
I'll change I swear
Baby don't go
I'll make you wait
I promise I'll be better
All of these things they will change
