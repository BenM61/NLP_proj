Turn it up
Watch the skies for signs or planes
Same old bad news again today
Just a thousand ways to make torture sound polite

From H. Block to Springbok, bok, bok
Tell me when does the beating stop
I`m not prepared to just sit
And watch again tonight
Here it comes
Here it comes
Here it comes

We have a dream
There`s no use fighting it
It's burning burning bright
Dreams can come true
If you put your mind to it
And you`ve been tucked up alright
Burning burning bright
Oh, oh, burning burning bright
Oh, don`t put out the lights

From Moscow to Monterey
Maine to Mexico
It's hard to hear what the people say
It`s like they`ve one foot in their mouoths
And the other in their graves

From H. Block to Springbok, bok, bok
Tell me when does the beating stop?
Are you prepared to just stand
And watch again tonight?
Here it comes
We have a dream
And there`s no use fighting it
It's burning burning bright
Dreams can come true
If you put your mind to it
And you`ve been tucked up alright
Burning burning bright

Burning burning bright
Sha sha sha sha sha
Ha ha
Ha ha
Ha ha ha
Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes
Yes, we have a dream
There`s no use fighting it
Burning burning bright
Dreams can come true
If you put your mind to it
And you`ve been tucked up alright
Burning burning bright
Ha ha, burning, burning, burning, burning, burning bright
So don`t put out the lights
