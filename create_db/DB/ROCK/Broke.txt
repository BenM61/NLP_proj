Broke account so I broke a sweat
I've bought some things that I sort of regret about now
Broke your glasses, but it broke the ice
You said that I was an asshole and I paid the price
Broken hearts want broken necks

I've done some things that I want to forget but I can't
Broke my pace and ran out of time
Sometimes I'm so full of shit that it should be a crime
Broke a promise cause my car broke down

Such a classic excuse it should be bronze by now
Broke up, and I'm relieved somehow
It's the end of the discussions that just go round and round
And round, and round, and round, and round,
And round, and round it shouldn't have been anyway
No way, no way, no way, that's right

Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh no
It was like everything was evidence of broken (time?)
You're living on fancy wine
You'll drink that turpentine
You're starting conversations
You don't even know the topic
