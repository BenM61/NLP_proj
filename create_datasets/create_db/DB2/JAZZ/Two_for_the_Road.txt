If you're feeling fancy free,
Come wander through the world with me,
And any place we chance to be, 
Will be a rendezvous.

Two for the road,
We'll travel through the years, 
Collecting precious memories,
Selecting souvenirs 
And living life the way we please.

In the summertime the sun will shine,
In winter we'll drink summer wine,
And any day that you are mine, 
Will be a lovely day.

As long as love still wears a smile,
I know that we'll be two for the road,
And that's a long long while.
