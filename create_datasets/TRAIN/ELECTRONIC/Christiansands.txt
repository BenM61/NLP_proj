My defenses

Become fences

I'm stumbling

I change my face
And you think I'm fake-up
Wait around till I take off my makeup
Here we go again
I need another one
Her name is
She looks through me
Says I'm the only one

I've met a christian in christian sands, a devil in Helsinki
I've met a christian in christian sands, a devil in Helsinki

Is it getting better?
Wrote her a letter, asking questions
Maybe some deceptions
I mean we'll take it slow
I really don't know
When you talk, you make me cringe 
Silver me to the messenger
Let her go don't question her

I've met a christian in christian sands, a devil in Helsinki
I've met a christian in christian sands, a devil in Helsinki

You and me, what does that mean?
Always, what does that mean?
Forever, what does that mean?
It means we'll manage
I'll master your language and in the meantime I'll create my own
By my own
