[Chorus]
There's no mercy on me 
No crying myself to sleep 
No mercy on me 
Nightmares have become my dreams 
No mercy for me 
Good morning reality 
Will I wake we'll never know 
I'm late for my date with destiny 
Let me go 
Let me go 
You've got to let me go 
Right or wrong 
Let me go 
I'm on my path 
Let me go 

My mama loved me more than I do 
She said you Pop was jus' like you 
Trapped in a vicious circle 
Jesus youngest disciple 
Tell the judge if he throwed the book at me 
Make it the bible 
Start calling myself the king 
For lack of a better title 
Loyal beyond belief to my detriment 
It's so vital I change or blow opportunities 
Like a choir recital 
Now while I do not care who telling 
Meanwhile selling powder puts food in the bellies 
Well it's, unfortunate 
The orphanage couldn't keep up the mortgages 
Kid go to school stupid they teachers ignoring it 
Sorta just doomed, forced into being a goon, selling kush in a jar 
Mixing at ton, a balloon 
Consumed with the same way of life I left 
Everything I know now learned by myself 
All you see are the whips 
The Maserati's Ferrari's 
So they don't sympathize 
Don't nobody feel sorry 
No mercy 

There's no mercy on me 
No crying myself to sleep 
No mercy on me 
Nightmares have become my dreams 
No mercy for me 
Good morning reality 
Will I wake we'll never know 
I'm late for my date with destiny 
Let me go

Everybody's standing and waiting an they're hating 
Gospels say they should forgive me 
They'd rather hand me to Satan 
Blatant displays the day of hypocrisy 
Boy you got to be kidding 
Could it be possibly the second coming of Pac is me? 
Remember that 
When he was here 
And when he died you realized you need him here 
God with me partner 
Ain't no one for me to fear 
Hindsight twenty twenty
Future not as clear 
But I'm a rider till I die 
Put bullets 'tween my eye 
I just ask that I can make my peace with god and say goodbye 
F*ck up the world like Lady Di 
One the day he died 
His wife and sons and daughters know that every day he tried 
To be a person all they wanted better verses 
They could market to the merchants 
But when they closed curtains 
You could be for certain ain't nobody perfect 
But when you're rich nobody gives a shit 
No mercy 

There's no mercy on me 
No crying myself to sleep 
No mercy on me 
Nightmares have become my dreams 
No mercy for me 
Good morning reality 
Will I wake we'll never know 
I'm late for my date with destiny 
Let me go 
You've got to let me go 
Let me go 
Let me go 
Let me go
