I really need her
She
She
She
She

She loves
She
She
She

I have found a lady
That's so real to reality
She's the kind of lady
That's so fresh
And dressed to
The trip

Flowers, fancy
Car, diamonds and
Gold
She wears it well
She's the kind
That's close to me
And flower can't you tell

She's mine
She's mine
And she's fine
And I know so deep
In my heart

I really need her
And I know that
She, is the one I love
She, one I'm thinking of
She, that girl
Blows my mind
She, I know my
Girl is fine

Leather and lace
And designer
Pantyhose
She looks so good to me
Bad from head to toe
Body so hot
Looks so good
She makes me sweat

I know I love that girl
I know I can't forget her
She's mine
She's mine
And she's fine
And I know so deep
In my heart

I really need her
And I now that
She, is the one I love
She's, one I'm
Thinking of
She's, the lady
Of my dreams
She's, not the
Way it seems

She
She
She
She
And I know that
She
