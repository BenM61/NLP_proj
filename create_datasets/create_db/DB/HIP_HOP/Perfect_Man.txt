Oh  oh  oh  oh 
Caramel complexion 
With the sexiest expression 
Curly hair and corn rolls 

Very nice physique ?? clothes 
He looked at me 
I looked at him 
He asked me what I was thinking 

Because he walked so beautiful 
I didn't know what to say to him 

He was what I wanted 
Exactly what I needed 
He was what I fantasized 
He was what I dreamed 
And it would be so perfect 
If him and me would leave 
Why couldn't I just tell him my feelings? 
We were meant to be 

[Chorus]
I spotted him walking in the doorway 
Of the restaurant of the other day 
When I met that perfect man 
I didn't speak when I had the chance 
I didn't know exactly what to say 
At the restaurant the other day 
When I met that perfect man 
I didn't speak when I had the chance 

Sexy lips, platinum wrists 
Ten tips like he gets manicures 
I can't resist those eyes of his 
Staring at his lips and then his ears 

And his voice is hypnotizing 
And his hand was tantalizing 
I dismissed what I wished 
Without me realizing 

He was what I wanted 
Exactly what I needed 
He was what I fantasized 
He was what I dreamed 

And it would be so perfect 
If him and me would leave 
Why couldn't I just tell him my feelings? 
We were meant to be 

[Chorus: x2]

All you ladies listening if you ever have the chance 
To run into your definition of that perfect man 
Don't be blinded by how fine the man is 
And miss the chance that might be your last 
Make him understand that he's your perfect man 

Na, na, na, na 
Na, na, na, na, na 
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na 
Na, na, na, na 
Na, na, na, na, na 
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na 

[Chorus]
