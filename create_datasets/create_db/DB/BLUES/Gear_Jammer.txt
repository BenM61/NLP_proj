Yeah
Running my rig around ninety-five
Rockin' and rollin' in overdrive
Yeah, my heart's beating like a jackhammer
It's the midnight ride for the gear jammer

Nine long days through twenty-three states
I gotta see my baby soon you know I just can't wait
Yeah, the police catch me I'll end up in the slammer
'Cause the law don't want no gear jammer

Running my rig in a mighty high gear
I don't care where I go just long as it ain't here
Something gets in my way you know I'm gonna ram it
Nobody fools around with this gear jammer

Yeah, running my rig along ninety-five
I'm a-rockin' and a-rollin' in overdrive
Yeah my heart's beating like a jackhammer
Don't you get in the way of this gear jammer
