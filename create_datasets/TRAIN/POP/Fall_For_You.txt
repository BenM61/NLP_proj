Broad horizon as I walk from your embrace
What I feel is nothing but the taste of you
I get buried in your mouth
I fall in, I don't care if I can't climb out

Look at the moon but I see only you
I'm days away, I'm a man in a caravan
By the sea
Waving at the old folks waving at me

I'll fall for you
When I get old and shake my pride
I'll call on you
We can do better than I am tonight

Be strong and you'll get strength back
Feed the fire and you'll get warmth back

I'm walking the plank, edging out, see the drop
If I take a new step will you follow or stop?
I look back from the ocean beneath to your eyes
your eyes

Broad horizon as I walk from your embrace
What I feel is nothing
But the taste of you
I get buried in your mouth
Are we in it together now?

I'll fall for you
When I get old and shake my pride
I'll call on you
We can do better than I am tonight

Be strong and you'll get strength back
Feed the fire and you'll get warmth back

If you've got any doubt I'll cast them out
I feel you close around me, I'm living for two

I'll fall for you
When I get old and shake my pride
I'll call on you
We can do better than I am tonight

For you
When I get old and shake my pride
I'll call on you
We can do better than I am tonight
