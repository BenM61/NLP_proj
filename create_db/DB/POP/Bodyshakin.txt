Chorus: 
You got my body shaking 
Sends a shiver to my soul 
I didn't get no warning 
You got me shaking to the bone 
I got my secret weapon 
I'm gonna get you all alone, yeah, yeah 
So let your body lose control 
I was the boy walking tough, king of the street 
Believed in making my own destiny, yeah 
Victim of love, I made a promise that I'd never be 
Another one of love's fatalities 
Rule number one was running wild and always running free 
Didn't need no luck, my guardian angel looking over me 
You passed me by, I got the vibe, left me in disbelief 
Arrow to my heart at hurricane's velocity 
You pierced my emotional armor 
Bolt of lightning couldn't hit me harder 
Repeat Chorus 
Everybody say I aim too high, out of my league 
I gotta step into reality, yeah 
Different sides, different styles, certain tragedy 
I got you in my sights, so please believe it's harmony 
You pierced my emotional armor 
Bolt of lightning couldn't hit me harder 
Repeat Chorus 
Rap: 
This is simple as one, two, three 
We've been drawn together by a love-power energy 
I want to be your lover 
I want to be your friend 
I want to be your lifetime, not just your weekend 
Check, check it out, check it out, check it, check it out 
I want to be home boy, ain't no doubt 
I want to be your first choice, never let you down 
Love, peace, I'm out of here, brothers 
You pierced my emotional armor 
Bolt of lightning couldn't hit me harder 
Repeat Chorus to fade
