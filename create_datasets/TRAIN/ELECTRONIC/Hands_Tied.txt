Listen
You're askin' me if I
Know what real love feels like
If I ever loved anyone inside
It can't be serious (serious)
'Cause I was the one givin' all I had
I kept my promises all intact
For better or worse I honored that
I could show you all about love

Baby, I can love you, love you, love you with my hands tied
I can please you, please you, please you with my hands tied
Everything you need is right here
It's just staring you in your face
Stop askin' me if I'm ready
'Cause this is just what I'll say
'Cause I could love you, love you, love you
With my hands tied, with my hands tied, with my hands tied (hands tied)

Don't ever question my love
I love hard despite the
Heartbreaks I made light of
You see, I've been all wrong, been all wrong
I was the one tryin' to patch it up
(?) say I've had enough
All I just keep thinking of
I could show you all about love

Baby, I can love you, love you, love you with my hands tied
I can please you, please you, please you with my hands tied
Everything you need is right here
It's just staring you in your face
Stop askin' me if I'm ready
'Cause this is just what I'll say
'Cause I could love you, love you, love you
With my hands tied, with my hands tied, with my hands tied (hands tied)

Now I don't need my hands to feel the things I feel inside
'Cause I know what's inside my heart is right
(They don't have to hold you like that) no, baby
(They don't have to touch you like that) no, no
'Cause you know the truth is that
I could love you with one hand tied behind my back
(Hands tied, hands tied, hands tied)
I can love you, baby

Baby, I can love you, love you, love you with my hands tied (hands tied)
I can please you, please you, please you with my hands tied (hands tied)
Everything you need is right here
It's just staring you in your face
Stop asking me if I'm ready
'Cause this is just what I'll say (this is what I'll say)
'Cause I can love you, love you, love you (with my hands tied)
'Cause I can love you, love you, love you
With my hands tied, hands tied, with my hands tied (hands tied)
