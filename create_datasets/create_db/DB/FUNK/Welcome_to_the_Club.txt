Welcome to the club welcome lonely heart

Left me for a dream 'cause you thought that the grass was greener
Now you're back crying to me, case you want sympathy from me
Did you think that I would take you back just because your crying
Well now the jokes on you 'cause your heart has been broke in two

So welcome to the club, welcome to the lonely niceties, you did to me
Welcome to the club welcome lonely heart
Welcome to the club, now you how sad it feels to be 

Left here all alone, with only a picture to hold on to
You don't know where to turn 'cause the one that you love is gone
When you said good bye, you didn't care if I lived or died
So now you'll see how your self how it feels to be left behind

So welcome to the club, welcome to the lonely niceties, you did to me
Welcome to the club welcome lonely heart
Welcome to the club, now you how sad it feels to be like me

Welcome to the club welcome lonely heart
Welcome to the club, welcome to the lonely niceties, you did to me
Welcome to the club welcome lonely heart
Welcome to the club, now you how sad it feels to be like me

Welcome to the club welcome lonely heart
