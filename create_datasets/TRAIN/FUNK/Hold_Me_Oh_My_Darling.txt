Whoa, whoa
I want you to hold me
Oh, my darling
And never, never let me go
Oh, kiss me
And tell me you love me, yeah, yeah
Because I-I-I-I-I-I-I, I love you so
I, I love you, I love you so

Oh, when
When I'm alone and troubled, baby
And my life, life, my life seems dark as night, ooh
Then I ask baby, I'll ask, I'll ask, please
Oh, oh please, please be my guiding light
Won't you be, be my guiding light?

You know I get such a strange sensation
Every time I hear your name
Now all of my friends and my relations
They say I'm loving you, loving you in vain, yeah, yeah

Snuggle, snuggle, snu-snuggle on my shoulder, baby
Come on and tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me you care, darling
Oh, as our love, our love, our love, our love grows older, baby
Ooh, tell me that the flame, the flame, oh, baby will still be there
That the flame, flame will still be

Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna hold you, baby
Never let you go, now what you gotta say?
Hold me, baby, yes I will, darling
I'll love to remember it darling, yeah, yeah
Hold me, I'm gonna hold you in my arms
I know, I know, I know, baby
