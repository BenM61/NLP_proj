Raise up your hands
And put a smile on your face
I'm talking to everyone
In the human race
We're proud and strong
So stand up tall
Let's all get together
Bring peace to the world
There's a train of love
Beginning right here
So jump on to it
And have no fear
It's yours, it's mine
We got the call
Let's all get together
And bring peace to the world
Let's all get together
Bring peace to the world
Let's all get together
Bring peace to the world
Every man and woman
Boy and girl
Let's all get together
Bring peace to the world
Shelter the homeless
Open your door
Feed the hungry
Give to the poor
Offer your heart
Don't think small
Let's all get together
Bring peace to the world
Let's all get together
Bring peace to the world
Let's all get together
Bring peace to the world
Every man and woman
Boy and girl
Let's all get together
Bring peace to the world
