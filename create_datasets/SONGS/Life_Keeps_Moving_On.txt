A heart of gold, a new beginning
The greatest gifts you gave to me
You changed the way I live, said I had so much to give
Opened my eyes to things I couldn't see

And all the dreams that you created
Were just like wishing on the star
I could look into your eyes 'cause I've got them memorized
And I'll remember them, no matter where you are

I know that life keeps moving on and on
I know I'll never love this way again
But in my heart I know I must be strong
And as long I'm alive, I can make it if I
Just remember life keeps moving on

A stranger came while I was sleeping
And took the dreams I had away
Now I need to lean on you, please, tell me what to do
Help me remember the words you taught me to say

I know that life keeps moving on and on
I know I'll never love this way again
But in my heart I know I must be strong
And as long I'm alive, I can make it if I
Just remember life keeps moving on

And sometimes when the nights are lonely
I need your lovin' arms to hold me close to you
I never had the chance to say goodbye
Only wish I had someone to tell my troubles to
Tell me what am I gonna do? What am I gonna do, baby?

I know that life keeps moving on and on
I know I'll never love this way again
But in my heart I know I must be strong
And as long I'm alive, I can make if I
Just remember life keeps moving on

I know that life keeps moving on and on
I know I'll never love this way again
But in my heart I know I must be strong
And as long I'm alive, I can make if I
Just remember life keeps moving on

I know that life keeps moving on and on
