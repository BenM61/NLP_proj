We live and we learn and crash and we burn and were gone
We take what we know and we learn as we go and we run

Run until that day
We can see who we are
Have the final say
We keep being who we are
As love lights the way to the last day
And no one can take it away

Run and hide (run and hide)
Don't hide at all (don't hide at all)
Change is coming, know its nothing personal
Live our lives (live our lives)
Now hide it all (now hide it all)
Change is coming, know its nothing personal

We live and we learn and crash and we burn and were gone
(We live and we learn and crash and we burn and were gone)
We take what we know and we learn as we go and we run

Run until that day
We can see who we are
Have the final say
We keep being who we are
As love lights the way to the last day
And no one can take it away

Run and hide (run and hide)
Don't hide at all (don't hide at all)
Change is coming, know its nothing personal
Live our lives (live our lives)
Now hide it all (now hide it all)
Change is coming, know its nothing personal

We live and we learn and crash and we burn and were gone
(We live and we learn and crash and we burn and were gone)
We take what we know and we learn as we go and we run
(We take what we know and we learn as we go and we run)

We live and we learn and crash and we burn and were gone
(We live and we learn and crash and we burn and were gone)
We reap what we sow and we come and we go when were young
