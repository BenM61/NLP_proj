I gave up on lovin' a long long time ago
Ooh yeah I had myself believing I'd rather be on my own

If you're pickin' and choosin'
Yeah playin' it cool
Well ya wind up losin'
I'm no fool
I won't give up on loving
No I won't give up on love
Get that love-I won't let that love
Escape me once again
I'm gonna get that love and make it mine

You know that hearts and flowers never
Meant that much to me
But telling lies, lies, lies to myself will never set me free

If you're pickin' and choosin'
Yeah playin' it cool
Well ya wind up losin'
I'm no fool
I won't give up on loving
No I won't give up on love
Get that love-I won't let that love
Escape me once again
I'm gonna get that love and make it mine

You know you can build any fortress, any that you choose
Then later discover the prisoner, the prisoner is you

If you're pickin' and choosin'
Yeah playin' it cool
Well ya wind up losin'
I'm no fool
I won't give up on loving
No I won't give up on love
Get that love-I won't let that love
Escape me once again
I'm gonna get that love and make it mine
