When I'm on the phone
There's no reception here

Miss, would you be interested in switching your internet service providings 
To a provider that provides a better service of internet service
Providing than your current provider, uh

I was walking down the street
And the bill boards seemed to stare
And the poster seemed to date
And dated what they did wear

And the buildings on the banquet
You dress doesn't sell here
When I'm on the phone
There's no reception here

You don't understand me
You don't know my game
I say what's the malfunction?
You say internet connection!

I'm down like my internet connection
I'm down
I'm down like my internet connection
I'm down
I'm down like my internet connection
I'm down
I'm down like my internet connection
I'm down 

I crashed again last night
I was on there surfin' out of my mind

I crashed again last night
I was on there surfin' out of my mind

The system shutted down
They tried to take what found
I'm holdin' shit around town
Tryin' to hold me down

I'm standing at the station
In need of education
Its the medicated nation
We can't be more patient

You don't understand me
You don't know my game
I say what's the malfunction?
You say internet connection!

I'm down like my internet connection
I'm down
I'm down like my internet connection
I'm down
I'm down like my internet connection
I'm down
I'm down like my internet connection
I'm down

I crashed again last night
I was on there surfin' out of my mind

I crashed again last night
I was on there surfin' out of my mind

Dude
Something dude
Something dude
Dude something

I'll date you
I'll take you a while
I'll peck him on the lips
I'll take him on my hips
These geeks are just freaks
And I got em on my flip

I'm gettin' off the computer
I'm going to do something
Yeah something

I'm down like my internet connection
I'm down
I'm down like my internet connection
I'm down
I'm down like my internet connection
I'm down
I'm down like my internet connection
I'm down
(I crashed again last night
I was on there surfin' out of my mind)

You got the beat
Turn it up
You got to give it to me

You got the beat
Turn it up
You got to give it to me
