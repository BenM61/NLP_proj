Only in days, they get together
They're talking volumes, and drink some coffee
Clipped out, clear and bright
They pour out all, their own true mankind

There's no truth, it's extinct
There's no lies, that's gone too
There's no truth, it's extinct
There's no lies, that's gone too

All he says causes scandal
I've heard it said that he's the original of the vandal
He steals your words
Clears our mind

There's no way, you can fool me
There's no way, that's for sure
There's no way, like accepting
There's no way, that's damned sure
There's no way, you can fool me
There's no way, that's for sure

Yeah, yeah

There's no truth
There's no lies
There's no way, you can fool me
There's no way, that's for sure
There's no way, you can move me
There's no way, for sure
There's no truth
There's no lies
