Things get stuck in my head
And they're taking me no where
And sometimes it's hard
Just to find what you need

But lately I'm feeling
Something good's come around
Cause she just takes me way up
And she won't let me down

And beautiful feelings are starting again
And all of my heartaches are starting to mend
And beautiful feelings are there till the end
So I open them up and I let them in

Well I needed to feel
That I'm destined for something
And I need to get down on my knees
More and pray
And I need to feel a warm body near mine
When I wake in the morning
Suddenly to find

That beautiful feelings are starting again
And all of my heartaches are starting to mend
And beautiful feelings are there till the end
So I open them up and I let them in

I get feeling guilty
From climbing too high
I'm looking for problems
That just don't apply

And beautiful feelings are starting again
And all of my heartaches are starting to mend
And beautiful feelings are there till the end
Til beautiful feelings die
