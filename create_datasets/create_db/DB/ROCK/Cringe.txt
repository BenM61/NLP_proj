Lover come over
Look what I Done
I been alone so long
I feel like I'm on the run

Lover Come over
kick up the dust
I got a secret
Starting to rust

She said I'm looking like a bad man
Smooth criminal
She said my spirit doesn't move like it did before
She said that I don't look like me no more no more
I said I'm just tired
She said you're just tired

I said I saw you in the water
I said I saw you in the water

Lover come hold me
Heads on the fritz
Body intoxicated 
feelings comfortably mixed
Lover come hold me
Could you forget?
I got a secret
Digging a ditch

She said I'm looking like a bad man
Smooth criminal
She said my spirit doesn't move like it did before
She said that I don't look like me no more no more
I said I'm just tired
She said you're just tired

I said I saw you in the water
I said I saw you in the water

Sweating all your sins out
Putting all your thoughts back together
Oh we just don't blend out
All of my attempts seem to weather

Oh I make you cringe now
Don't I make you cringe?
Oh I make you cringe now
Don't I make you cringe?

I said I saw you in the water (do I make you cringe?)
I said I saw you in the water (do I make you cringe?)
