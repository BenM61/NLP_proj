A kiss goodnight is alright
But remember this
That a kiss goodnight leads to another kiss
A kiss goodnight with a hug real tight
Is nothing short of bliss
And a kiss goodnight leads to another kiss
It's an old custom for a boy and girl to embrace
In some secluded place
LIttle mister cupid never could be quite so stupid
As to do a turn about face
So it just ain't right to kiss goodnight
And stop at 3 or 4
'Cause a kiss goodnight leads to a dozen or more

It's an old custom for a boy and girl to embrace
In some secluded place
Little mister cupid never could be quite so stupid
As to do a turn about face
So a kiss goodnight is alright
But remember this
That a kiss goodnight leads to another kiss

If you like me like I like you
Don't stand there at the door knock knock
A kiss goodnight and hug real tight
And we'll run into a dozen more
