I've seen days where it seems like my nights won't end.
Every dream that I had has been lost in the wind.

But Your words brought me back to the truth.
Life begins and will end with You.

So I trust that my life will be safe in Your hands.

As I stand in the eye of the storm, It's Your love that keeps guiding me home.
I am fearless.
I am fearless.

I felt the fear as I stood before the giant.
3 stones trembling in my hand.
And in the end not a whisper from the army.
No one believing this was in Your plan.

But Your words brought me back to the truth.
Life begins and will end with You.

As I stand in the eye of the storm, It's Your love that keeps guiding me home.
I am fearless.
I am fearless.

Through the dark, You're my light and salvation oh within me.
We'll trust in You, Lord.
I am fearless.
I am fearless.

If You're with me, who can be against me?
I have no reason to fear...oh oh oh oh.
If You're with me, who can be against me?
I know You're keeping me near.

As I stand in the eye of the storm, It's Your love that keeps guiding me home.
I am fearless.
I am fearless.

Through the dark, You're my light and salvation oh within me.
We'll trust in You, Lord.
I am fearless.
I am fearless.
