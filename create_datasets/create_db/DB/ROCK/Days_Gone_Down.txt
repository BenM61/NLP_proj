[Chorus]
Shine a light, shine it bright on the days gone down
Shine a light, shine it bright on the days gone down
Shine a light, shine it bright on the days gone down
Shine a light, shine it bright on the days gone down

You still got that light in your eyes
And our day is comin' by and by
I'm jailed on this long road here with you
We still gotta long way 
We still gotta long way to go

The first time I set eyes on you
I listened to you sing, yeah yeah
We didn't have to speak 
'Cause the words said everything
Yes, you walked right into my life
And we were on our way, yeah
So long ago
But it feels like yesterday

And I just want to tell ya...

Shine a light, shine it bright on the days gone down
Shine a light, shine it bright on the days gone down
Shine a light, shine it bright on the days gone down

We won't forget the days gone down 
They're written in our hearts, yeah yeah
And we're as much in tune as we were right at the start
It all seems so much harder now 
It seemed so easy then, yeah yeah
Well, someday just for fun we might do it all again

I just want to tell ya...

You still got that light in your eyes, yes you do
And our day is comin' by and by
I'm jailed on this long road here with you
We still gotta long way
We still gotta long way to go

Shine a light, shine it bright on the days gone down
Shine a light, shine it bright on the days gone down
Shine a light, shine it bright on the days gone down
Shine a light, shine it bright on the days gone down
