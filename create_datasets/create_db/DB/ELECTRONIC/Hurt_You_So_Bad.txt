Now let me state it for the record 
I'm jaded but when you looked at me 
I couldn't escape it 
I really hate it when I'm out of control 
But baby after the show 
My mind just wouldn't let go 
Tell me was it a hallucination 
That made me feel so alone 
And even though I have never met you before 
I can't get you out of my head 
Now I'm pouring out my heart for you 

[Chorus]
I never meant to hurt you so bad 
I'm just trying to get over you 
I hope you never meant to hurt me so bad 
Don't you feel the same way too 

So now I sit and think of what I can say 
When you look at me to re-ignite the connection 
I'm gonna take you to a place beyond time 
Somewhere that we've never been 
Someplace that I couldn't find 
Tell me if you're feeling my addiction 
Without you I just can't disguise 
How much I need to see your face one more time 
I can't get you out of my head 
Now I'm pouring out my heart for you 

[Chorus]
