I'm not gonna say everything is OK
Cause OK is not the way that I feel.
I'm not gonna be any fool's Christmas tree
Let 'em hang gifts on me that aren't real

I'm not gonna take second best
I've got no use for the rest.
World you better hear what I say
Cause for me true love could be
100 years away.

I'm not givin' in to a smile or a grin

On a face -huh- I might never see again.
I'm not gonna fly in some big phoney sky
On a ride that I know just can't win.

And I'm not gonna take second best
No I've got no use for the rest.
So world you better hear what I say
Cause for me true love could be
100 years away.

And if it is, I'll wait.
