(Pitched voice:) Always lived my life alone, 
Been searching for the place called home. 
I know that I've been cold as ice, 
Ignored the dreams, too many lies. 
Somewhere deep inside, Somewhere deep inside me, 
I found ... the child I used to be
And I know that it's not too late 
Never too late... 

3 AM!
