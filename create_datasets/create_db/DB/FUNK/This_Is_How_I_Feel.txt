Why can't I get you off my mind
Clips of your body on rewind
If I come over would it be right
No I ain't sober
Dropping so high if love if love if love
Is that alright

'Cause you don't know how hard I go
I'm a feign for
I just want more
This is how I feel
This is how I feel
This is how I feel
This is how I feel

I'm going to take time, can't we get lost
Look how you shine, how much you cost
And I can't afford all of you

'Cause you don't know how hard I go
I'm a feign for
I just want more
This is how I feel
This is how I feel
This is how I feel
This is how I feel

Yours right next to mine, beauty so divine
I'll stay in for life, life, talk to me
Tell me where, starting to feel it, the feeling again
I feel you now oh

This is how I feel
This is how I feel
This is how I feel
This is how I feel
