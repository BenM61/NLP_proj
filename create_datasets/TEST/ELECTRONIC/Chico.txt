When I'm out, when I'm out, when I'm out,
When I'm out of love.
Chicofriend, chicofriend, chicofriend
Will be around.

He will ease, he will ease, he will ease
He will ease my mind.
Fill my heart, fill my heart, fill my heart,
Fill my heart with blood.

He will carry me, carry me, carry me, carry me.
He was a fortune teller, he was a fortune teller.
So when I'm out, when I'm out, when I'm out,
When I'm out of love.

Chicofriend, chicofriend, chicofriend
Will be around.
He will carry me, carry me, carry me, carry me.
Cause he was a fortune teller, he was a fortune teller.
Teller, teller, teller
