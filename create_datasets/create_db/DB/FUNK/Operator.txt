Operator, operator, I'm so glad that you rang my phone 
Operator, operator, I'm so glad that you found me home 

I can hear my long gone lover 
I've waited such a long long time 
So please, operator 
Put him on the line, I want him on the line 
I want him on the line 
I wanna talk to that long gone lover of mine 

Operator, operator, there is static in my line 
Did he say that his love was true? 
Did he say that his love was mine? 
Did he say he was coming home? 
Did he say where he has been? 
I can't hear a word he's saying 
If you keep buttin' in, you keep buttin' in 
You keep buttin' in 
I wanna know if he's comin' home again 

It shouldn't take this much time 
To clear my line, to ease my mind 
Oh operator, please get straight 
It's unfair to make me wait any longer 
My curiosity is stronger 
Don't you know that it's wrong, oh so wrong 

Operator, operator, this is very strange 
What is the holdup here? Doesn't he have the change? 
Oh please operator, if he don't have another dime 
Reverse the charge to me 
Put him on the line, I want him on the line 
I want him on the line 
I wanna talk to that long gone lover of mine 

I didn't expect him, please connect him right way 
I beg of you to put him through without delay
