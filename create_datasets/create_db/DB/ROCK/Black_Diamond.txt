Again I see you standing there watching me
Your gaze, those eyes are tantalizing openly
Inviting me to get close to you
Can't help myself
There's fascination in the air
I try to fight this strong sensation
But there's no chance to escape from this temptation

Feels like I've known you before
Repeating phrases
But I yearn for something more
I know I can't stay by your side forever
But I know I won't forget your beauty
My black diamond
