It's been some time since 97
When you chose to sail away
Now take a seat and stay forever
And make me stop counting the days

Lately I heard you're doing well
Though I don't know how that feels

Believe in me - after all
Believe in me - and hear me call
There's a world behind these walls that I just need to see
Believe in me

Every dream that had been shattered
Disappears without a trace
Now that I've found what really matters, yeah
After you had gone away

Even though you had been doing well
Don't you hide behind a smile 

And just believe in me
Believe in me
Believe in me
Believe in me

Believe in me - after all
Believe in me - and hear me call
There's a world behind these walls that I just need to see
Believe in me
