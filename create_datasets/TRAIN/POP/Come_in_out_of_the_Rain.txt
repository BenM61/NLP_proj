You said you believed that we'd
Find love together happily
And after all the wrong I've done
You feel that I'm still the one
To give you love into
So bring it home to you...

You told me that you'd love me 
If I'd ever change
Welcome me into your arms again
Come on in out of the rain. Hey hey hey

There's a place in your heart to love me again
Happiness and joy you bring
When you call my name
Come on in out of the rain
I loved no one but you
But I strayed. I know I made you blue
You spoke unto my very soul
You warmed my heart that once was cold
Now I'm so glad to know. No no no

You told me that you'd love me 
If I'd ever change
Welcome me into your arms again
Come on in out of the rain. Hey hey hey

Some people spen a lifetime looking for love
And I have love right here all of the time
Why did I try to deny it?
Deep inside I just couldn't find it
You turn my life around
The love I've lost is found
So let the rain come down

You told me that you'd love me 
If I'd ever change
Welcome me into your arms again
Come on in out of the rain. Hey hey hey
Baby come out of the rain...
