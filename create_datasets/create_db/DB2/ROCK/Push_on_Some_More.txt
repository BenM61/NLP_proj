If he hadn't come running
Sometimes I'm very hard, too strong
So he could be here in a minute
So quick, I couldn't catch up
Don't count on me, don't you count on me
Yes, you better believe
He would like to travel in hard speed 
And doesn't know the road that well
All the sorting out wouldn't that please 
And would you leave me in your trail
Don't count on me, don't you count on me
Yes, you better believe

He's such a fool, ruining it all
He's such a fool, ruining it all
Such a fool working too hard
Begging for more
He's such a fool, ruining it all
He's such a fool, push on some more
Just a fool working too hard
Begging for more

Maybe everything is perfectly clear
I'm so tired of walking
We've got a thing it's supposed to be shared
If I sit and he just stands talking
Don't count on me, don't you count on me
Yes, you better believe

He's such a fool, ruining it all
He's such a fool, ruining it all
Such a fool working too hard
Begging for more
He's such a fool, ruining it all
He's such a fool, push on some more
Just a fool working too hard
Begging for more

I live in his smile
And his favourite shirt 
I bring his good name hey
Down to the dirt
Don't count on me, don't you count on me
Yes, you better believe

He's such a fool, ruining it all
He's such a fool, ruining it all
Such a fool working too hard
Begging for more
He's such a fool, ruining it all
He's such a fool, push on some more
Just a fool working too hard
Begging for more
