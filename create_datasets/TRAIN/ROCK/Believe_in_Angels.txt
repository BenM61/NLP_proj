You say we're all the same
And girls just like to tease
We like to play the game
And keep you down on your knees

You got a broken heart
So now we're all to blame
Boy she's giving girls a bad name

You're searching the skies, for some kind of sign
But you say
A love like that could never come true

What you're longing to find, you had it all the time
What's it gonna take to make you see it too ooh

How can you say
You don't believe in angels
'cause I'm real and I'm
Right here in front of you
How can you tell me
That your hearts still waiting?
When I'll give you a love
Like you never knew
How can you feel it and still not believe it
Everything you say you need (whoa)
How can you say you don't believe in angels
Do you believe in me

You used to dance with me
But it's not like before
We feel the chemistry
Now could it be something more

Maybe I'm what you want
What you've been praying for
Heaven sent me to your dance floor

You're searching the skies, for some kind of sign
But you say
A love like that could never come true

What you're longing to find, you had it all the time
What's it gonna take to make you see it too ooh 

How can you say
You don't believe in angels?
'cause I'm real and I'm
Right here in front of you
How can you tell me
That your hearts still waiting?
When I'll give you a love
Like you never knew
How can you feel it and still not believe it?
Everything you say you need (whoa)
How can you say you don't believe in angels?
Do you believe in me?

I can't appear in your sky
I don't have wings, I don't know how to fly
But my love can take you higher
I could set your heart on fire 

(Let's Dance)

How can you say
You don't believe in angels?
How can you tell me
That your hearts still waiting? 
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

How can you say
You don't believe in angels?
How can you tell me
That your hearts still waiting? 
How can you feel it and still not believe it?
Everything you say you need (whoa)
How can you say you don't believe in angels?
Do you believe in me?

How can you say
You don't believe in angels?
How can you tell me
That your hearts still waiting? 
How can you feel it and still not believe it?
Everything you say you need (whoa) 
How can you say you don't believe in angels?
Do you believe in me
