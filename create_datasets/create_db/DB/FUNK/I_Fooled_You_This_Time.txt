Higher than the highest mountain
And deeper than the deepest sea
That's how I will love you, oh, darling, endlessly

Softer than the gentle breezes
And stronger than the wild oak tree
That's how I will hold you, oh, darling, endlessly

Oh, my love, you are my heaven
You are my kingdom, you are my crown
Oh, my love, you're all that I prayed for
You were made for these arms to surround

Faithful as a morning sunrise
And sacred as a love can be
That's how I will love you, oh darling, endlessly

Darling, endlessly
Darling, endlessly
