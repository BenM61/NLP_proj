I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Calim hmm, I don't think so
I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Calim, I don't think so

Going back to Cali, styling, profiling
Growling, and smiling, while in the sun
The top is down, on the black Corvette
And it's fly, cause it's sitting on Dayton's
Laurents steering wheel, plushed out, gold-leaf phantom top
And three girls waiting
Vroom engine's blowing, the chrome, is shining
Passing all the cars on the way
Movement of the wind, back wheels spin
Pop in a cassette and push play

I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali, yea y'all, I don't think so
I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali

I'm going back to Cali, shaking 'em, baking 'em
Takin 'em to spots they never before hung
The place, on Sunset it's a trip
Where the A.C.'s cold, and the girls still strip
The record skip, but this girl kept dancing
Prancing, grinding, grinning, romancing
I asked her to the barn, so we could hit the hay
I want to do this, Brutus, but I don't want to pay

I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali, no man I don't think so
I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali

I'm going back to Cali, rising, surprising
Advising, realizing, she's sizing me up
Her bikini, small; heels, tall
She said, she liked, the ocean
She showed me a beach, gave me a peach
And pulled out the suntan lotion
Now I thought that was fast, but this girl was faster
She's looking for a real good time
I said, "Close your eyes, I got a surprise,"
And I ran away with the bottle of wine

I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali, I don't think so
I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali, I don't think so
