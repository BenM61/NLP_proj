Ok, let's go to work
Who the f*ck are you 
The workaholic 
The workaholic

The workaholic he works every day, 24 hours, no time to play
He won't quit; he's addicted to work
I think he's going out like a jerk
Working, Working, what can you do? 
See the light from a different point of view
Ready in the morning for the bell to chime
I think he's glad it's working time 

The workaholic

Work your body, baby work your soul 
Keep on workin' workin' to the bone 
Work your body, baby, work your soul
I'm a workaholic when I'm on the floor

The workaholic

First like a jerk, why you always work? 
Messing up your mind with that paperwork? 
The only think you need is to break ball 
Is work, and yo and shat's all 
They do it for money, but he for fun
He won't get away until the job is done
Drinkin' drinkin' like an alchoholic
The guy is just a workaholic

The workaholic 

The workaholic 

The workaholic
