Your beautiful name
Is always the same
I'll bring you chalk
So you can write it on a wall

You play beautiful games
That I always lose
One bright hopeful day
Someone will speak of our fortune
I'm sure

Your beautiful name
Is always the same
Soon I'll write it large
Across a wall on the boulevard

It's engraved in my mind
Each letter shines
It'll stay there until evermore
Soothes me to the core

We sit in cars
We sit in planes
You're dead right
For me

You're dead right
You're always right
You're on the right
Side of me
