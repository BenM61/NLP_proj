Pedaling through
The dark currents
I find
An accurate copy
A blueprint
Of the pleasure
In me

A secret code carved, a secret code carved

He offers
A handshake
Crooked
Five fingers
They form a pattern
Yet to be matched

On the surface simplicity
But the darkest pit in me
It's pagan poetry
Pagan poetry

Morsecoding signals
They pulsate and wake me up
From my hibernating

On the surface simplicity
But the darkest pit in me
It's pagan poetry
Pagan poetry

I love him, I love him
I love him, I love him
I love him, I love him
I love him, I love him

This time
I'm gonna keep it to myself

This time
I'm gonna keep me all to myself
And he makes me want to hurt myself again

And he makes me want to hurt myself again
