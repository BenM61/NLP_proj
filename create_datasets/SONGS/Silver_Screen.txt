Coming home from the drive-in, it was Saturday night
Disagreed on opinions and we started started to fight
When we got in the driveway it had gone much too far
Couldn't see past our egos to the blade in our hearts

I wanted to say
Put me in the movies
Put me on a king size silver screen
Only in your wildest Hollywood dream
Put me in the movies

Everyday conversation disappears in a flash
With the bright sunny winter mixed with volcanic ash
Oh then you're whining and crying the blues to me
It was just an illusion and we both let it be

I guess it will be
Put me in the movies
Put me on a king size silver screen
Only in your wildest Hollywood dream
Put me in the movies

Somewhere in Arizona near the Mexico line
Saw your face in the windshield, heard your voice in my mind
So I pulled out your picture, stopped the car for a while
Gotta go and see you
With a tear and a smile put the picture away

Put me in the movies
Put me on a king size silver screen
Only in your wildest Hollywood dream
Only in the movies

M-m-m-movies
M-m-m-movies
M-m-m-movies
M-m-m-movies
Only in the movies
Put me in the movies
Put me in the movies
Put me in the movies
Put me in the movies
Put me in the movies
Put me in the movies
