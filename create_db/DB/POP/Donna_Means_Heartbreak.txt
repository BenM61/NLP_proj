Don't mention Donna, when I'm around
When I hear her name,the world just turns upside down

[Chorus:]

To others Donna means beauty
Donna means heaven,Donna means ecstasy,
But Donna means heartbreak to me

I still remember,her soft caress,the touch of her lips
And the warmth of her tenderness

She ran around,like a there was no tomorrow
And every boy in town, new the thrill of Donna's feel
And all the time, I thought she was mine
She belonged to everyone,everyone,every,every,every one

Donna means heartbreak to me
