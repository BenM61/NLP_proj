Life is sometimes very strange
Never know where you are headed for
What to do nothing new
Nothing seems to be worth living for

'Cause sometimes you fall off the track
But that don't mean it's wasted
Come on get your timing right
And check out what's a coming

Don't kiss the D-Train
Kiss the D-Train
Don't kiss the D-Train
Kiss the D-Train

You think you got no place to run
But just ahead there is an open floor, yeah
'Cause once you give it up for good
But all you know is you have locked the door

Why don't you just take a break
That's all it's sometimes takin'
Try to get your timin' right
And make you stop from running wild

Don't kiss the D-Train
Kiss the D-Train
Don't kiss the D-Train
Kiss the D-Train

Now you've jumped off from the ride
There's so much left that's worth it living for
'Cause you can't run, no, you can't hide
And you won't see while walkin' with closed eyes, no

Come on it ain't paradise
But that don't mean it's wasted
You've gotta get your timin' right
And check out what's a comin'

Don't kiss the D-Train
Kiss the D-Train
Don't kiss the D-Train
Kiss the D-Train

Don't be messin' with the D-Train
Kiss the D-Train
Stay away from the D-Train
Kiss the D-Train

Knock that shit off
