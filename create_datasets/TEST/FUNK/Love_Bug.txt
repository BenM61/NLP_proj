When you're near me I feel so romantic
When you're far away I'm always blue
If you want me to remain romantic
Here are all the things you'll have to do
 
Hold me honey won't you hold he
Hold me never let me go
Take me honey won't you take me
Never to forsake me
'Cause I love you so
Thrill me, let your kisses thrill me
Just like you alone can do
Hold me tenderly enfold me
Never try to hold me from you
 
I love every little thing about you
Every thing you say and all you do
I would be a total loss without you
What becomes of me is up to you
 
Hold me honey won't you hold me
Hold me never let me go
Take me honey won't you take me
Never to forsake me
'Cause I love you so
Thrill me Let your kisses thrill me
Just like you alone can do
Hold me tenderly, enfold me
