This house does not feel like a home, Is it occupied?
This life is not one that I own, Do I dramatise?
These days I think I'll stay at home, By the fireside
Just leave the outdoors to get on, While I theorise

There is nothing here to celebrate
I should be kickin' out my heels parade, Ah
If it fits then I'll wear it
If you can hear me I'll declare it, Share it

I've called your name out, Sunny and blue
I've picture sitting, Just me and you
No one else is, Ever around
This is the acid test that I've, Found

At least three times in a single week, I am run aground
There is no warning I can seek, I am always found
There is no rhyme or reason to this, A fault appears
With the gaping hollow under my feet, I disappear

There is nothing here to stop me
I just fall until it's got me, Ah
If it fits then I'll wear it
If you can hear me I'll declare it, Share it

I've called your name out, Sunny and blue
I picture sitting, Just me and you
No one else is, Ever around
This is the acid test that I've, Found

I think I need to shake up, wake up fast
Forgive a little low, I won't let it last
With every little day that passes
Something is fixin' if something is broken
This conversation is no longer talkin'

I've called your name out, Sunny and blue
I picture sitting, Just me and you
No one else is, Ever around
This is the acid test that I've, Found
