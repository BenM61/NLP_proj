What I don't know 
You could tell me
What I should know
If you'd let me know
How you feel
How I love you
What I don't know 
Couldn't hurt me
But what I could show
If you'd let me know
Just how you feel
How I love you

Come on & say it
Sooner or later 
You're gonna need it
You've got to make up your mind
You gotta choose
You're gonna lose everything
Tell me just one good reason
Why you won't say 
What you feel inside
Dismiss your pride
Why don't you tell me

Come on & say it
Sooner or later 
You're gonna need it
You've got to make up your mind
You gotta choose
You're gonna lose everything

Come on & say it
You're gonna need it
Come on & say it
The sooner the better
Baby, baby, baby
Come on & say it
Come on & say it...
I know you want it...
