This is the Rocket Powered Space Capsule
All systems are go

And the story goes, a young man will come and
Save the universe from the forces of evil

Take a second to adjust to the ride
They say if this was a crime, it'd be federal
Lately I've been feelin' invincible
As I'm tryna find my way can't nothing hold me though
I say, get a clue, the vibes all around you
Try but you can't deny when its in your soul
Lets take it where there aren't any roads
Where these sucka hatin' niggas can't follow

Take it to the satellite, tonight
Take flight to the moon
Come get in my space whip!
To the satellite, tonight
Take flight to the moon
Take a ride!

No worries

Come on don't be shy
Let your guard down and work it
Do just what you want
Anything you choose
I tell ya, there's no way we could lose
Have you ever seen the Earth from this view?
I bet not

Take it to the satellite, tonight
Take flight to the moon
Come get in my space whip!
To the satellite, tonight
Take flight to the moon
Take a ride!

Take a ride!

And now, the vibes
Heavy little thoughts get jumbled in a bundle
And they're tucked deep down in the back of my brain
Heavy little thoughts get jumbled in a bundle
And they're tucked deep down in the back of my brain
Heavy little thoughts get jumbled in a bundle
And they're tucked deep down in the back of my brain
All is life and all is pain
Down the hallway of my endless fate

Take it to the satellite, tonight
Take flight to the moon
Come get in my space whip!
To the satellite, tonight
Take flight to the moon
Take a ride!

Take it to the satellite, tonight
Take flight to the moon
Come get in my space whip!
To the satellite, tonight
Take flight to the moon
Take a ride!

Come on
Come on
Dream on
No worries

Wicked
