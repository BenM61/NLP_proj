We could dim the light of day
Watching colors drift away
Beating like the sound of love
Reflecting light back to the sun

Listen as the silence plays
Washing darkness from the shade
Standing on the center stage
Building castles in the rain

Be my strength
Show me the way
Come to life
Come and feel the sun
Lift your hands, embrace
Breaking waves of change

Counting down to brighter days
Consciously we elevate
Blowing all the dust away
Speaking truth to those who wait

Be my strength
Show me the way
Come to life
Come and feel the sun
Lift your hands, embrace
Breaking waves of change

I can hear your calling
From the distant plain
'Cause in this moment I feel love
I can feel you falling
Miles from yesterday
'Cause in this moment we are loved

Nobody here is lonely

Come to life
Come and feel the sun
Lift your hands, embrace
Breaking waves of change

Come to life
Come and feel the sun
Lift your hands, embrace
Breaking waves of change
