And with the dawn she changes
Her voice in different ranges
The torn and tattered pages
For all I've done, poor wages
Satisfied, I never lied
Say goodbye I couldn't try

Destroy her cards and letters
Act like I never met her
Hardest of all, forget her
Until my heart is better
Satisfied, I never lied
Say goodbye I couldn't try

And with the dawn she changes
Her voice in different ranges
The torn and tattered pages
For all I've done, poor wages
Satisfied, I never lied
Say goodbye I couldn't try
