I read your letter
I got it just the other day
You seem so happy
So funny how time melts away
It's such a pleasure to see you growing
And how you're sending your love
Through the air today

I think of heaven
Each time I see you walking there
And as you're walking
I think of children everywhere

It's in your star sign
You're growing stronger
I can't believe you
It's so good to care

Through enchantment, into sunlight
Angels touched your eyes
Your highness, electric, so surprised

Is this your first life?
It seems as though you have lived before
You help me hold on
You have a heart like an open door
You sing so sweetly
My love adores you
She does, she's thinking of you right now 
I know

The summer's coming
I'll keep in touch so you're not alone
Then like a Swallow, you'll fly away
Like birds have flown
So let me tell you
How much I love you
I'd make the songbirds sing
For you again

Well now it's good night
Sweet angel, read this letter well
