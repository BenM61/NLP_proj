Dig bury me
underneath everything that I am rearranging
Dig bury me
underneath everything that I was slowly changing

I would love to beat the face,
of any motherfucker that's thinkin' they can change me
White knuckles grip pushing through for the gold
If you want a piece of me I broke the motherfuckin' mold
I'm drowning in your wake
Shit rubbed in my face
Teething on concrete
Gums bleeding

Dig bury me
underneath everything that I am rearranging
Dig bury me
underneath everything that I was slowly changing

I struggle in violated space
Sell out motherfuckers in the biz that try to f*ck me
Hang by their Ts rated PG in sight
I ain't sellin' my soul when there's nothin' to buy
I'm livid in my space
Pissing in my face
F*ck you while you try
To f*ck me

Dig bury me
underneath everything that I am rearranging
Dig bury me
underneath everything that I was you ain't fuckin' changin' me

Dig c'mon motherfucker
Dig c'mon motherfucker
Dig c'mon motherfucker
Dig

Let me help you tie the rope around your neck
Let me help to talk you the wrong way off a ledge
Let me help you hold the glock against your head

Let me help you tie the rope around your neck
Let me help to talk you the wrong way off a ledge
Let me help you hold the glock against your head
Let me help you chain the weights onto your legs
Get on the plank f*ck

Dig bury me
underneath everything that I am rearranging
Dig bury me
underneath everything that I was slowly changing

Wish you were committing suicide
suckin' on a motherfuckin' tailpipe
Dead man hangin' from a tightrope
Limbless in the middle of a channel
Bombs away
