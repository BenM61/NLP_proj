Save me a mountain to climb
Save me a river to cross
At midnight the sound of the stockyard trains
Wail in the distance and rattle my chains
Save me a valley like the one in the distance
Save me a canyon to swallow this jail

I wanna stand outside and feel the rain when it falls
Breathe the air on the other side of these walls
Save a mountain for me
Save a mountain for me
It sounds like a choir when the chaingangs shout
Save me a mountain for when I get out

Save me a desert, just me and the sand
Save me a sea to sail
In my heart I know I'm too weak to be strong
I've been wasting away in this jail for too long
Save a mountain for me
Save a mountain for me
It's like a choir of fallen angels when the chaingangs shout
Save me a mountain for when I get out

"Has the jury reached a verdict?"
"We have your honour."
"How does the jury find?"
"We find the defendant guilty."
"Do the defendants have anything to say on their behalf
Before the court pronounces sentence?"

Save me a mountain to climb
Save me a river to cross
At midnight the sound of the stockyard trains
Wail in the distance and rattle my chains
Save me a valley like the one in the distance
Save me a canyon to swallow this jail

If only I could tie all these dreams together
I could break out of the big house and run forever
Save a mountain for me
Oh save a mountain for me
It's like a choir of fallen angels when the chaingangs shout
Save me a mountain for when I get out
Save a mountain for me
Save it, save it
Save a mountain for me
It sounds like a choir when the chaingangs shout
Save a mountain for me
Save a mountain for when I get out
I need a mountain
Save a mountain.
