Times is hard, baby and the hustle is really on
Times is hard, baby, the hustle is really on
Prices are high now darlin', and all the good jobs are gone

Sorry to say, baby, things ain't what they used to be
Sorry to say, baby, things ain't what they used to be
Better get yourself a job now, baby, I'm tired of you worrying me

Well, you made a lot of money, baby, but you never saved a dime
Yes, you made a lot of money, baby, but you never saved a dime
If you save yours now, mama, that ain't no fault of mine

Times is hard baby and the hustle is really on
Times is hard baby, the hustle is really on
Prices are high now darlin', and all the good jobs are gone
