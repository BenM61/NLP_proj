I remember your silhouette on Dyes Inlet
Against the silver sheen of a moon like painted glass
Under stars out on a pier; a celestial sphere
We were weightless as the waves that disappeared

Northern lights filled our skies
Empty nights synchronized

We shared a clove cigarette on the parapet
As the TVs glowed from the windows of the model homes
And I'd never be that close again to your lips and perfect skin
As the tide receded into the unknown

Northern lights filled our skies
Empty nights synchronized
Northern lights filled our skies
Empty nights synchronized

I remember your silhouette on Dyes Inlet

Northern lights filled our skies
Empty nights synchronized
Northern lights filled our skies
Empty nights synchronized
