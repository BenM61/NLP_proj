The kiss, sweetest
And touch, so warm
The smile, kindest
In this world, so cold and strong

We're so close to the flame
Burning brightly
It won't fade away and leave us lonely

The arms, safest
And words, so good
The faith, deepest
In this world, so cold and cruel

We're so close to the flame
Burning brightly
It won't fade away and leave us lonely
