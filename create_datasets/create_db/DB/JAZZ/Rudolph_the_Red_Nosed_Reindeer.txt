Rudolph

Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudy
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight

Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudy the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history

You'll go down in history
