Why do birds suddenly appear
Every time you are near?
Just like me, they long to be close to you (so close to you)

Why do stars fall down from the sky
Every time you walk by?
Just like me, they long to be close to you (so close to you)

On the day that you were born, the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair
And gold and starlight in your eyes of blue
Your eyes of blue

And that is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around
Just like me (just like me) they long to be close to you (so close to you)

Hey, just like me
They want to be (so close to you)

Close, so very close
So very close to you (so close to you)

Close, so close
So close to you (so close to you)

So close, so very close
So very close to you

So close (So close to you)
