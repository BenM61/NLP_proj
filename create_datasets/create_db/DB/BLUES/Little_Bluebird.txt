I know a little bluebird
I sure wish she would sing for me
I'll tell you all, I know, I know a little bluebird
I sure, I sure wish she would sing for me
I'll tell you why

She's been flying around so long, oh Lord
I wish she would land in my tree
Every time she goes by, I want to cut her wings, yeah
I say every, every, every, every, every, every, every
Every time she goes by, oh, I want to clip her wings
You know why

So we can lock up in her nest together
Oh, I'll buy her pretty things, yes I will
Oh, little bluebird, please come and nest with me
Oh, Lord, have mercy, little bluebird
Please, oh, please come and nest with me
I'll tell you why

Oh, I'll make life so wonderful, baby
You and me in my tree, oh

Oh, little bluebird, please come nest with me
I think I better call her again a little louder
Oh, Lord, have mercy, you pretty little bluebird
Please, please, please come and nest with me

Oh, I'll make life so wonderful, baby, yes I will
You and me in my tree, oh

Oh, little bluebird, it's true that I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
Oh, I love you when you fly, baby
Oh, little bluebird, Lord yeah, just keep on, keep on
Whatever you're doing, keep on flying with me
Oh, oh, oh, little bluebird
