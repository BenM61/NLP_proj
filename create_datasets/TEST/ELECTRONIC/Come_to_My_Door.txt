So long we've been distant now
Since you set out on your own
You told me you had to find
Something to believe in
Never thought you'd ever leave
But as you walked out the door
I prayed that you would soon find
All that you needed
While you're out there on your own
If the rain starts falling
Or you get too cold
If you need a place to go

Oh, I just want you to know
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Oh, you can come to my door
I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind at all

So long you've been searching now
But still I can see your face
The memories numb this pain
Just for a moment
At night I lie sometimes
Awake in my bed
Repeating over and over
Repeating over and over
Our conversation
Right now as the moon is shining
I know you're out somewhere
And you're doing fine
If you ever feel alone baby

Oh, I just want you to know
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Oh, you can come to my door
I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind at all

And on that fateful day
You know I will be waiting, oh
You'll smile at me, then say
You loved me all along
And you'll come home

Oh, I just want you to know
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Oh, you can come to my door
I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind at all

Oh, I just want you to know
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Oh, you can come to my door
I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind at all

Ooh, I just want you to know
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Oh, you can come to my door
I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind at all

Ooh, I just want you to know
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Oh, I just want you to know
It's alright, you can come to my door, it's alright, I don't mind
