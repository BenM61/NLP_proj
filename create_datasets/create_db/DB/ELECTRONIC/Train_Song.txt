Last night when I saw him
Last night last week
When I saw my lover with a flush in his cheek
I went up to the window and I held out my hand
He's a demon lover and a spiritual man

But I think somebody will tell him
'Cause they think that he ought to know
I've been looking from my bedroom window and falling in love

I've been found out, what's my mother gonna say
I've been found out, what's my mother gonna say

I'm in trouble 'cause I've been watching
Watching in your bedroom window
It's the skin I'm catching
Maybe I'll see you around tomorrow

Well I seek him in candlelight
Why do I seek
I can love his body and I don't have to speak
Well I stood by his shoulder and I blew on his fave
In his eyes were the pastures of a much greener place

But I think that stitches will mend him
And his feet choose a path that they know
Looking from his bedroom window and falling in love

I've been found out, what's my mother gonna say
But I was dragged down to a level of dismay

I'm in trouble 'cause I've been watching
Watching from your bedroom window
That's the train I'm catching
And I don't want to see you alone no more
