When I think about you 
My feelings cant explain 
Why after all this time 
My heart still feels pain 
When I look at you 
Memories of love 
Like no one before 
You'll stay on my mind 
 
Always so special 
I was yours and you were mine 
Made for each other 

You'll stay on my mind 
For always and for ever 
You will be my Saturday love
