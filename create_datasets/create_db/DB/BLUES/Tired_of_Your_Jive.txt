You're sittin' there lookin' proud
Thinkin' you're so fine
Tryin' to run around
With every friend of mine
Think you're so smart baby
Think that I'm a fool
Yeah, I'm gonna tell you baby
You'd better play it cool

I'm tired of your jive
Yeah baby I'm tired of your jive
I refuse to be your fool mama
Hey I'm tired of your jive

You think that I don't see
What you do behind my back
You think I outta love you baby
No matter how you act
You'll never miss your water baby
Till the world goes dry
I'm gonna tell you
Gonna miss me, bye and bye

I'm tired of your jive
Yeah baby I'm tired of your jive
I refuse to be your fool mama
Hey I'm tired of your jive

Sittin' there smilin'
Like nothing's wrong
I don't intend to pull your coat baby
You'll know it when I'm gone
You'll never miss your water baby
Till the world runs goes dry
Now I'm gonna tell you
Gonna miss me, bye and bye
