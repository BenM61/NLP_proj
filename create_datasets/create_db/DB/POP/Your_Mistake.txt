I'm not right
And I'm not fine
I want to be rain that tastes like wine
I want to be good
I want to be great
I want to be everything except for your mistake

Send me inside your mind
I want to know what you're thinking
This time I'll try to be the one you always thought you knew

It's true
I'm blue
And without you 

I'm not right 
I'm not fine
I want to be rain that tastes like wine
I want to be good
I want to be great
I want to be everything except for your mistake

Let me into your view
I want to know how you see this thing that's us
I must keep managing my madness over you

It's true
I'm blue
And without you 

I'm not right 
I'm not fine
I want to be rain that tastes like wine
I want to be good
I want to be great
I want to be everything except for your mistake

And I don't want your sympathy just understanding
We'd be better off if I just took some time to try to understand you

I'm not right 
I'm not fine
I want to be rain that tastes like wine
I want to be good
I want to be great
I want to be everything except for your mistake

I'm not right
I'm not fine
I want to be rain that tastes like wine
I want to be seen
I want to get clean
I want to just fall out of in-between
I'm not right
I'm not right
I don't want to be your mistake
