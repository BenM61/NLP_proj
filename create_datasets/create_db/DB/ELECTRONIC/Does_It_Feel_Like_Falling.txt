I got stars in my eyes
And a sea in the dark
Just a word to the wise
Don't go tripping over your heart
'Cause it feels so fast
When you're going down
All you see is a flash
Like a boxer in the first round
Tell me that you're shook up like I am
Tell me how you feel I need an answer

When I'm with you
Does it feel like falling
'Cause here we are
Backs against the floor

They say you never see it coming
Does it feel like falling

Does it feel like
Falling, falling for you
Falling, falling for you
Falling, falling for you
Does it feel like
Falling, falling for you
Falling, falling for you
Falling, falling for you

Does it feel like falling

I see stars in the sky
And they'll be there tomorrow
Will you be in my life
In the many nights to follow
'Cause it goes so fast
When it's going down
All you feel is a crash
It's like lightning striking the ground
Tell me that you're shook up like I am
Tell me how you feel, I need an answer

When I'm with you
Does it feel like falling
'Cause here we are
Backs against the floor

They say you never see it coming
Does it feel like falling

Does it feel like
Falling, falling for you
Falling, falling for you
Falling, falling for you
Does it feel like
Falling, falling for you
Falling, falling for you
Falling, falling for you

Does it feel like falling

It's so hard from just one touch
Baby, I surrender

Trinidad
No thief in the night
No fear for tomorrow
No keeping the light
I wanna be honest with you
Real love in your eye
Got passion to follow
No hiding tonight
Honestly I'm yearning for you
Now pause
My marathon has ran off
My oxygen to my heart
Must have been a little off because it just paused
Now tell me why we fell off
When we elected on my prospective
You felt neglected, it's contraceptive
Rebirth the message, I felt connection

Does it feel like
Falling, falling for you
Falling, falling for you
Falling, falling for you
Does it feel like
Falling, falling for you
Falling, falling for you
Falling, falling for you

Does it feel like falling
(Falling for you, yeah)
Does it feel like
Falling, falling for you
Does it feel like
Falling, falling for you
(Falling for you, yeah)
