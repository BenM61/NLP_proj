And every broken bone
Every stone they throw
We may fall to our knees
But it's gonna be alright
Seeing you so cold
Right insight your soul
Like you never know
We're living on the outside
We're living on the outside
We're living on the outside

And every broken bone
Every stone they throw
We may fall to our knees
But it's gonna be alright
Seeing you so cold
Right insight your soul
Like you never know
We're living on the outside
We're living on the outside
We're living on the outside

And every broken bone
Every stone they throw
We may fall to our knees
But it's gonna be alright
Seeing you so cold
Right insight your soul
Like you never know
We're living on the outside
