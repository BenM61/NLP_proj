I'm a poor boy, I'm a long way from home
I'm a poor boy, I'm a long way from home
What the others do, the world can't do me no harm
I'm a poor boy, a long way from home
Babe I can't stay here long, babe I can't stay here long
What the others do, the world can't do me no harm
I'm a poor boy, I'm a long way from home
Well my, baby's dead and gone
Well my, baby's dead and gone
Well, well, well, well I'm a long way from home
I'm a poor boy, I'm a long way from home
And the world, can't do me no harm
And the world, can't do me no harm
Oh , no no no no, I'm a long way from home
World can't do me no harm
World can't do me no harm
World can't do me no harm
