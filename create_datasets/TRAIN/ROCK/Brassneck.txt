No, I sent you that letter  To ask you if the end was worth the means  Was there
really no in between?  And I still don't feel better  I just wondered if it
could be like before  And I think you just made me sure!  But then that's
typically you  And I might have been a bit rude  But I wrote it in a bad mood 
I'm not being funny with you  But it's hard to be engaging  When the things you
love keep changing   Brassneck, Brassneck  I just decided I don't trust you
anymore  I just decided I don't trust you anymore   First time you came over 
Do you remember saying then you'd stay for good?  No I didn't think you would 
Well we couldn't've been closer  But it was different then and that's all in
the past  There I've said it now at last!  You grew up quicker than me  I kept
so many old things  I never stopped quite hoping  I think I know what it means 
It means I've got to grow up  It means y  Brassneck, Brassneck  I just decided
I don't trust you anymore  I just decided I don't trust you anymore   I just
know, you weren't listening were you?  Oh please go, whenever you prefer to  I
said it means a lot, when you use an old phrase  But then so what?  We can't
have it both ways  I know, you're not bothered are you  Even so, I'm not going
to argue  He won't object!  Keep writing to me  Just don't forget you ever knew
me
