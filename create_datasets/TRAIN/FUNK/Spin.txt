Governments elected, nobody votes.
Politically correct, isn't that a joke?
We censor music then give children guns.
On CNN, still fighting to death over Jerusalem.
A four letter disease still makes us run,
Can't comprehend that you can die from Love.

Can I start things over, and change your mind?
Can a single melody press rewind?
Can I move your feet, make your heart skip a beat?
Can a simple tune flow through you?
When the music feels like this,
When you lose control you gotta go with it.
Ten feet high, flying above the sky.
Your problems don't exist, when music feels like this.

No money left in Africa
Starvin' to death In Bosnia
we close our eyes and hide a nation's cries
And In the West TV Possessed and weight obsessed
The media dissects, infects
We think real life is reality TV

Can I have your attention and press rewind?
When the DJ spins, will it change your mind?
Can I move your feet, make your heart skip a beat?
Can a piece of me flow through you?
When the music feels like this,
When you lose control, you gotta go with it.
Ten feet high flying above the sky.
Your problems don't exist, when music feels like this.

When the music feels like this,
DJ take control and grab a hold of me.
Spin that wheel, tell me how to feel. 
I like the shape I'm in, when music feels like this.

Bringin' the beat back, stompin' the floor.
Dancin' like a booty never bounced before.
Poppin' to the back beat, up on the one.
Smack Jack Freakin' now you're overcome.

When the music feels like this,
When you lose control, you gotta go with it.
Ten feet high, flying above the sky.
Your problems don't exist, when music feels like this.

When the music feels like this,
DJ take control and grab a hold of me.
Spin that wheel, tell me how to feel. 
I like the shape I'm in, when music feels like this.

Let the music in
Let the DJ spin
Let the music in
Cuz the music should feel 
Like this
Let the music in
Let the DJ spin
Let the music in
The Music Feels like this

When the music feels like(repeat to fade)
When the music feels like(repeat to fade)
