In conversation in conversation in conversation

in conversation, your mind is acting now
To take what's coming could make you change your mind
Piece of the action, look who's in pieces now
It turns me 'round and around

I'm struggling, I'm waiting, watching for the sidelines
It's obvious I'm chasing, there's got to be an answer
Distraction takes over when I'm deep in conversation
I'm looking & learning
That my heart is running faster all the while

when I say I'm sorry, it's not that I'm afraid
Guess I'll have to guess again
One day it happens, next day it's all at rest
Who made this happen to me?

I'm struggling, I'm waiting, watching for the sidelines
It's obvious I'm chasing, there's got to be an answer
Distraction takes over when I'm deep in conversation
I'm looking & learning
That my heart is running faster all the while

in conversation, our minds are acting now
Let's ask those questions again
Whay am I angry? why am I doing this?
I made this happen to me

I'm struggling, I'm waiting, watching for the sidelines
It's obvious I'm chasing, there's got to be an answer
Distraction takes over when I'm deep in conversation
I'm looking & learning
That my heart is running faster all the while

aahh aahh aahh aahh
