Costanza: 
Round round 
Round round 

Costanza & Tricky: 
I'm antimatter 
I don't matter 
Cancer phones 
Break my bones 

I'm illusion 
Sonic solution 
Magic mind 
Sonic pollution 

I just detox 
I just see lots 
I see nothing 
Show me something 

We go round and round 
We make it safe and sound 
I try to break it down 
Alright 
(2x) 

(We go round) 
I have visions 
Homosapiens 
Fast I've grown 
I think alone 
I'm confusion 

Evolution 
I'm in man cub 
Institution 
I move forward 
I make awkward 

I just jump jump 
I just thump thump 

We go round and round 
We make it safe and sound 
I try to break it down 
Alright 
(2x) 

I evolve 
Then dissolve 
Maintain my laws 
?til April falls 

My sea runs red 
My trees are dead 
My breath runs short 
Please report 

Is there someone out there 
Is there someone out there 
Do you receive me 
Do you receive me 

We go round and round 
We make it safe and sound 
I try to break it down 
Alright
