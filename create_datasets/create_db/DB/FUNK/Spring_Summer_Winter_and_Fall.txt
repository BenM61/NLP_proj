Spring, summer, winter and fall
Keep the world in time,
Spinning around like a ball,
Never to unwind.

Spring, summer, winter and fall
Are in everything.
I know in love we had them all,
Now our love is gone.

This last thing
Is passing now
Like summer to spring,
It takes me
And wakes me now
Like seasons I'll change
And then rearrange somehow.

Spring, summer, winter and fall
Keep the world in time,
Spinning around like a ball
Never to unwind.

Spinning around like a ball
Never, never to unwind.

Now our love is gone.
