Now I'm not the type that easily cries, uh huh
I must admit there was a tear in my eye
Now I know that I love you
And I know I'll be true too

Calling all boys, I'm calling all boys
I love you, I do
Calling all boys, I'm calling all boys
I need you, I do

Now I'm not the type that's easily swayed, uh huh
I must admit that I wanted to stay
Yes I know that I want you
And I'll always be true too

Calling all boys, I'm calling all boys
I love you, I do
Calling all boys, I'm calling all boys
I need you, I do

Hey boys I think you're cute 
In tight blue jeans and french cut suits
Outta sight, outta mind
You're quite a catch, you're quit a find

Oh you're slick, oh you're shick
You're so hot, you're so slick

You got class, you got style
Wanted you all the while

I'm not the type that easily cries

But I must admit there was a tear in my eye

Now I know that I love you
And I know I'll be true too

Calling all boys, I'm calling all boys
I love you, I do
Calling all boys, I'm calling all boys
I need you, I do

Calling all boys, I'm calling all boys
I love you, I do
Calling all boys, I'm calling all boys
I need you, I do

Calling all boys, I'm calling all boys
I love you, I do
Calling all boys, I'm calling all boys
I need you, I do

(Fade)
Calling all boys, I'm calling all boys
I love you, I do
Calling all boys, I'm calling all boys
I need you, I do

Calling all boys, I'm calling all boys
I love you, I do
Calling all boys, I'm calling...
