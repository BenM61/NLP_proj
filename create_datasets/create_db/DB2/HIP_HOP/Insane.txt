Somebody told me it was over
Nobody told me where it began
No one believes in you
I understand

Like a blind man
Who's lost his way
No one hears a word
Of what you say
I forgive you
Would you do the same

I would believe you
If only you'd be true
I would believe if it were true

Cause everybody wants to be a winner
Nobody wants to lose their game
It's the same for me
It's the same for you
It's insane insane insane insane insane
Insane insane insane insane insane insane

I don't know where you've been looking
I think it's only in your mind
It's tied so tight inside of you
All the thoughts unkind

I would believe you
If only you'd be true
I would believe if it were true

Cause everybody wants to be a winner
Nobody wants to lose their game
It's the same for me
It's the same for you
It's insane insane insane insane insane
Insane insane insane insane insane
Insane

I would believe you
If only you'd be true
I'm getting older
And I can't escape time

Cause everybody wants to be a winner
Nobody wants to lose their game
It's the same for me
It's the same for you
It's insane insane insane insane insane
Insane insane insane

Cause everybody wants to be a winner
Nobody wants to lose their game
It's the same or me
It's the same for you
It's insane insane insane insane insane
Insane insane insane insane insane insane
Insane
