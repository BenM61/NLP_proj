It's the simple things that makes me wanna love ya
The way you talk to me like nothing else matters
The way you flip your hair when you come to say hi
I'm already yours, you caught me by surprise
There is something more than physique and desire, oh yeah
It's not the clothes you wear (oh no no)
It's not the car you drive
It's not your nails, not your hair, not your hips I'm talking 'bout
It's right here in your chest (right here in your chest)
Beneath your beautiful dress (beneath your beautiful dress)
It's the love for yourself (it's the love for yourself)
You're the one I can tell (you're the one I can tell)

There is something more
Something more
Than what I used to see
Than what I used to see
There is something more
There's something more to you
Than what I usually see
On the side, on the side
I'm intrigued by you
I'm intrigued by you
There's something more to you (something more to you)
I'm intrigued by you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I stopped believing in love
So I've been forcing it out
Said I been living a lie
I knew it when I looked in your eyes
I'm the king of the world when you stand by my side
Can we fill the tank up and drive through the night?
I've been saving up, I don't wanna waste time
Leave it all behind, put it all on the line, oh
Can you give me one more night?
'Cause I'm 'bout to make this right
Tell me what you got to lose
You're intrigued, you know it's true
And we can see another day
With no more lies and no mistakes
Don't let the devil talk you through

There is something more
Something more
Than what I usually see
Than what I usually see
There is something more
There's something more to you
Than what I usually see
On the side, on the side
I'm intrigued by you
I'm intrigued by you (intrigued by you)
There's something more to you (something more to you)
I'm intrigued by you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
