Spirits move me, every time I'm near you
Whirling like a cyclone in my mind
You're my life line, angel of my lifetime
Answer to all answers I can find

Baby I want you come, come, come into my arms
Let me feel the wonder of all of you
Could it be magic now, now, now and hold on fast
Could this be the magic at last?

Let me feel the wonder of all of you
Could it be magic now, now, now and hold on fast
Could this be the magic at last?
