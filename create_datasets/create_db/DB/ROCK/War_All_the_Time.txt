Standing on the edge of the palisades cliffs 
In the shadow of the skyline very far away 
A lightning rod that couldn't pull the storm from me
I was 5 years old my best friends older brother died
He fell from these cliffs
The river washed him away the current pulled him downstream
In our eyes, floating in the headlights, so we parked these cars 
Parent's garage 
Listen to the lullaby
Of Carbon Monoxide

War all of the time
In the shadow of the New York skyline
We grew up too fast falling apart
Like the ashes of American flags
The sun doesn't rise 
We replaced it with an h-bomb explosion
A painted jail cell of blood in the sky like Three Mile Island
Nightmares on TV they used to sing us to sleep
They burn on and on like an oil field
Or a memory of what it felt like 
To burn on and on and not just fade away
All those nights in the basement the kids are still screaming
On and on and on and on 

War all of the time
In the shadow of the New York skyline
We grew up too fast falling apart
Like the ashes of American flags
And we're blowing in the wind
We don't know where to land
So we kiss like little kids
We used to be very tall buildings
We've been falling for so long 
Now your eyes follow the sign on the edge of town
They offer a welcome when you are leaving 

War all of the time
In the shadow of the New York skyline
We grew up too fast falling apart
Like the ashes of American flags
The pieces fall it's like a last day parade
And the fires in our streets start to rage, 
so wave, to the people that long to wave back, 
from the fabric of a flag that sang "love all of the time"

War all the time War all the time
All of the time
War all the time
War all the time
All of the time 
All of the time 
War all of the time
War all of the time
War all of the time
War all of the time
