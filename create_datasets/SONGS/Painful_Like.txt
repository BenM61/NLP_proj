Fighting in the borderline
You could come here any time
Run past their prying eye
You can come here any time
In the life, fire within
Their limbs, here art lies
My head keeps calling your
Housekeeper calling
Who will carry?
Who will carry?

It was in the morning light
Blue skin on top of mine
Give me the creeps, I'll pay for that
Hold you in my underwear
Give me the creeps, I'll pay for that
Someone might see, but I don't care

We done lost too many
In the land that barely goes
Doesn't your star look buried?
Holding my hands against your thigh
Who will carry?
Who will carry?
