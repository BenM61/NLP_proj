We come to make it hot for you

When we get down with the black suits, baby
Just let it loose up in here, go crazy
The way you're bouncin' and shakin'
I know you're feelin' me, so get up out ya seat
Come on and nod ya head with me
(Nod ya head)

When we get down with the black suits, baby
Just let it loose up in here, go crazy
(Let me see you nod ya head)
The way you're bouncin' and shakin'
I know you're feelin' me, so get up out ya seat
Come on and nod ya head with me

I am the man in black, I'm back
Breakin' the back
Of the random attackers
So can the flack

Yo, I'm dangerous
I've been trained to bust
When the strange of us
Try to endanger us

Praise me me y'all
Don't nothin' phase me, y'all
When they see me
They gaze be all crazy, y'all

They say I'm a myth
Trust me when if somebody rip
Out of the depths of your imagination
So here's Will Smith

Black suit, the black shades
The black shoes, black tie with the black attitude
New style black ray-bans, I'm stunnin' man
New hot in this pitch black 600 man

Don't you understand?
What you thought I wouldn't come again
Leave you hangin' without bringin' you the fun again
Tanglin' with the alien scum again
Mind your manners or the black suits runnin' in

(Nod ya head)
When we get down with the black suits, baby
Just let it loose up in here, go crazy

The way you're bouncin' and shakin'

Come on and nod ya head with me
(Nod ya head)

When we get down with the black suits, baby

Come on and nod ya head with me
(Yo, check it, yo)

It's just chick right, (Incomprehensible) makin' me sick right
Earth is worthless to her she be trippin' like
Frettin' that me n my mens tryin' to get the light
Thinkin' shes superwomen, but black Kryptonite

Finishin' whatever you start, son
Best lookin' crime fighter since myself in part one.
Better act right, play nice and sing along
'Cause case is back and he's hype, what? Bring it on

We come to blow down the block for ya, woo
Come to crack the street for ya, woo
Blast the windows out ya jeep for ya, woo

Yo, case closed, erase my foes
Chased away by the black suits, shades and clothes
We above the law, Feds can't touch me, y'all
Highly ranked, black blank ID cards

So disregard what you think you saw
Put that phone down, now
Who you think you callin', huh?
One little flash then, goodnight dear
Just open your eyes, honey; look right here, thank you

Mission completed
I mean it we wont be defeated
You seen it we did it
Even with weapons depleted

Galaxy defenders don't act like you don't remember
Taking contenders and provin' they only pretenders
Ladies and gentleman, boys and girls
The men is black is back to protect the world
When the enemy is near the elite is here
So have no fear, just let me see you
