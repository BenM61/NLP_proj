Come on

Yeah, NYC, the place to be
Look at all the rock heads, like you and me
Push against the pavement, take it to the street
Sick of all the hype now riding on the beat, yeah

Come on

Don't let us down, don't let us down
They're chasing us around all over town

Me watching power, illuminate the night
Pixilated fury, I'm blinded watch as I
Blank generation, they gots us
Knowing what the game is, never steal from us

Come on

Don't let us down, don't let us down
They're chasing us around all over town
Don't let us down, don't let us down
They're chasing us around all over town, yeah

Lead the way, man, drop your wall
Lead the way, man, drop your wall

Savage scene, you gotta chase the dream
Stand tall but you gotta root it all
Scarred for life, you gotta let it bleed
Burn the scene

Lead the way, man, drop your wall
Lead the way, man, drop your wall
Come together, come on

Don't let us down, don't let us down
Oh, come on
They're chasing us around all over town, oh

Don't let us down, don't let us down
Oh no
They're chasing us around all over town
Oh no, oh no, oh no
