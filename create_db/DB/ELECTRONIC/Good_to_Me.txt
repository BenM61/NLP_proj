Uh yo check it out
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Yo we gonna do something a little different here
Yo this is Mary Mary why'all
And Destiny's Child
Uh let me see you clap your hands
(Oh, oh)
Let me see you clap your hands
Let me see you clap your hands
(Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
No, no
It ain't the way they used to be
And yeah, yes
It may be hard to believe
When, when
I think about all my blessings
I oh I'm telling you God's been good to me

[Mary Mary]
Growing up in a real big family
I had to take what I could get
There was always a sister or brother
I had to share every thing with
I had to share my room
Wear hand-me-downs
Cause we didn't have much money
But now there's not much I long for
Telling you God's been good to me, oh no, no

[Chorus]
 
[Beyonce']
You may think I've got it easy
And that's the way it's always been
But that's not really my story
I'll tell you how it all happened
I had to work real hard to get here
But I didn't do it all alone
Someone was watching over me
And that is why I sing this song, oh no

[Chorus]

[Destiny's Child & Mary Mary]
If I began to count my blessings
I wouldn't know where to begin
God has done so much for me
He's been much more than a friend
He's been protector and provider
Though I didn't always know
Always been right beside me
And without him where would I be
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Been good to me
(So good to me)
So good to me
(So good to me)
Ooh, ooh, ooh...
So good to me
(So good to me)
And it ain't the way it used to be, oh no

[Chorus: x 2]
