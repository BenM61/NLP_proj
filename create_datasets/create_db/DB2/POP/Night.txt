It's in the night
That I get that lonesome feeling
Oh, the troubles of the day
Come rushing into my mind

It's in the night
That I start to think about you
And this ache that's in my heart
Gets stronger as time goes by

Morning brings relief from misery
I even manage a smile for friends I see
Darkness falls and then the shades of night
Reach out for me and try to hold me tight

And drag me down, down, down
And then once more
The night and you enfold me
And I'm caught in the web
That you spun when we first fell in love

I can't forget
The way you used to hold me
Will this memory of our love
Keep haunting me
Until the day I die

Morning brings relief from misery
I even manage a smile for friends I see
Darkness falls and then the shades of night
Reach out for me and try to hold me tight
And drag me down, down, down,
And drag me down, down, down, down, down
