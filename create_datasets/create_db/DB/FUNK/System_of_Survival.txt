The Human Race is runnin' over me 
I punch a clock at 9 and 5 
Just tryin' to make a livin' 
A plastic face on satellite TV 
Says, "Life is filled with give and take" 
He's takin' and I'm givin 
So I dance 

It's my system of survival (SOS) 
I'm dancin' 
System of survival (SOS) 
It's a system of survival 
Future revival 
Greet the new arrival 

At times it's the only way 
I'm gonna make it through this day 

Everybody get up 
Do your dance 
Keep survivin' 
Everybody get up 
Do your dance 
Stay alive 

A city night 
I walk a street in fear 
While politicians brag about 
A paperwork solution 

Another life 
I shed another tear 
I'm waiting for somebody new 
To lead the revolution 
So I dance 

It's my system of survival (SOS) 
I'm dancin' 
System of survival (SOS) 
It's a system of survival 
Future revival 
Greet the new arrival

It's my system of survival... 
(SOS) Send it out 
Send it out, send it out, send it out...
