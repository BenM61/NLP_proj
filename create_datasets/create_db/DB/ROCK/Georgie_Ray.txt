Before this day is cemented
In memory of Ray
Can we all do something instead of pray

And it was good how Georgie warned us
It was good what Georgie said
"It's kind of unbelievable how we're not all dead"

'Cause it's not over, all said and done

Why don't you say something?
Won't you say something?
Won't you say, say, say something?

Won't you say something?
Won't you say something?
Won't you say, say, say something now?
Before it gets dark

Before the language gets perfected
To a solitary grunt
Can we still sing electric on the sun?

Before it's over, all said and done
Before it's over, all said and done

I think it's probably best to say something
Won't you say something?
Won't you say, say, say something?

Won't you say something?
Won't you say something?
Won't you say, say, say something, now?
Before it gets dark, oh, it gets dark
Before it gets dark

Say something now
Before it gets dark, oh, it gets dark
Before it gets dark
