I want to break you into my world
I want to break you into my world
It doesn't have to be forever
Just till the feeling is over
Just till the feeling is over

You speak
It will help me
What I'm going through
Comfort make believe
Need to set you

I want to break you into my world
I want to break you into my world
It doesn't have to be forever
Just till the feeling is over

You call
The horizon lifting 
She'll be gazing and watching me 

Try to see
Try telling me
It back to control
Girl I crave for your soul

?
Break you into my
Break you into my world
It doesn't have to be forever
Just till the feeling is over
It doesn't have to be forever
Just till the feeling is over
