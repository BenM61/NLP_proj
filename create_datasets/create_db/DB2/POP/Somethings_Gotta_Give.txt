When an irresistible force such as you
Meets an old immovable object like me
You can bet just as sure as you live

Something's gotta give
Something's gotta give
Something's gotta give

When an irrepressible smile such as yours
Warms an old implacable heart such as mine
Don't say no because I insist

Somewhere, somehow
Someone's gotta be kissed

So, en garde, who knows what the fates might have in store
From their vast mysterious sky
I'll try hard ignorin' those lips that I adore
But how long can anyone try?

Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight it with all of our might
Chances are some heavenly star-spangled night
We'll find out just as sure as we live

Something's gotta give
Something's gotta give
Something's gotta give

Fight, fight, fight it with all of your might
Chances are that some heavenly star-spangled night
We'll find out just as sure as we live

Something's gotta give
Something's gotta give
Something's gotta give

Something's gotta give
Something's gotta give

Aw, let's tear it up
