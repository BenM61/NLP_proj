Can I see you (can I see you)
In the morning (in the morning)

Can I see you (can I see you)
In the morning (in the morning)

Can I see you in the morning
Like I see you late tonight
Come and hold me 
Come and hold me

Come and make me feel alright
In the morning
Can I see you in the morning 

Can I see you in the morning
Once I get down on my knees
Come and take me 
Come and take me 
Do with me just what you please 
Just a short walk in the sunshine
In the open side by side 

Chance to hold you 
Chance to hold you 
Chance to hold my head up high
In the morning

They say you're too for me
But I know ya said that ya'll wait for me, wait for me

Can I see you in the morning sun 
Shining down 

I want to see you
I want to see you

Can I see you in the morning sun 
Shining down

Can I see you
Can I see you

In the morning 
Can I see you 
In the morning
In the morning 
Can I see you 
In the morning 
Can I see you 
In the morning
