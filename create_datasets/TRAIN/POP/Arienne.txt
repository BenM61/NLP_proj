Arienne
I realise something's not in your favour
Arienne
I'll catch you when you fall

You turn in the world
The world turns grey
All alone
On your own
You're set in your ways

You breathe in a smile
Then wipe it away
Broken heart
Torn apart
And let down again

Arienne
I realise something's not in your favour
Arienne
I'll catch you when you fall

The view from the hill
Is not what it seems
From below
Don't you know
It's all in your dreams

Arienne
I realise something's not in your favour
Arienne
I'll catch you when you fall

Oh it's true
Oh it's true
I'll catch you when you fall

Arienne
I realise something's not in your favour
Arienne
I'll catch you when you fall
Arienne
I realise something's not in your favour
Arienne
I'll catch you when you fall
You fall...
