You wanna know me
What's to know
Do I amuse you
When the night is slow
Do your eyelids ever close
Caught spirits in your waking woes?

I know where to find you
I know where you go
And I just want to let you know
Oh, you can have me
You can have me all

Oh, you can have me
You can have me all

And you're twisted
What can I say
Your days are empty
And my tongue's decayed
And we're still just intently
One more night of your company

I know where to find you
I know where you go
And I just want to let you know
Oh, you can have me
You can have me all

Oh, you can have me
You can have me all

Oh, you can have me
You can have me all
Oh, you can have me
You can have me all
Oh, you can have me
You can have me all
Oh, you can have me
You can have me all
Oh, you can have me
You can have me all
Oh, you can have me
You can have me all
Oh, you can have me
You can have me all
Oh, you can have me
You can have me all
