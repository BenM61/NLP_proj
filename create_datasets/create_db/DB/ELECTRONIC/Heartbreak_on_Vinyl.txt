Heartbreak on vinyl
I've been missing you and how
The easy street is empty
The silence of the sound
I guess the turn tables have turned
Round round too many times (Times)
I wish we could just go back there tonight

I waited for you at the record shop
Walked through the doors and the records stopped
Heartbreak on vinyl was the name of the store
Now the store is gone and we can't meet there anymore
We were digging in the crates of love
Well darling, sometimes love just ain't enough
Heartbreak on vinyl was for people, I guess,
Who fall in love in analog and never let go

Heartbreak on vinyl
You couldn't hit the ground
Hello sweet sorrow (Sweet sorrow)
You're sweeping through my town
I guess the turn tables have turned
Round round too many times (Times)
I wish we could just go back there tonight

I waited for you at the record shop
Walked through the doors and the records stopped
Heartbreak on vinyl was the name of the store
Now the store is gone and we can't meet there anymore
We were digging in the crates of love
Well darling, sometimes love just ain't enough
Heartbreak on vinyl was for people, I guess,

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
And never let go
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Who fall in love in analog and never let go
Never let go, never let go
