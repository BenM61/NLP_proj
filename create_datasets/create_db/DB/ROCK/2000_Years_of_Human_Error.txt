I thought you'd tell me the truth 
But when you opened your mouth 
Out came a family of flies 

the book was already read 
Could never help us from 
Your conglomeration of lies 

You probably beleive what you told me 
A never ending cycle of greed 
Pass it down to each generation 
Another flock of sheep to mislead 

Scratch me harder 
Till I bleed 
God the father 
Spreads his seed 

Liars,Liars 
You sell it all to me 
Liars,Liars 
I'm what you'll never be 

And it feels so good when you've 
Sold another plot in the sky 
Like your teacher before you 
Really know how to sell your life 

Scratch me harder 
Till I bleed 
God the father 
Spreads his seed 

Liars,Liars 
You sell it all to me 
Liars,Liars 
I'm what you'll never be 

Give me something 
Something real 
Everything I see is nothing I can feel 
Give me something 
Something real 
Everything I see is nothing I can feel 

Liars,Liars 
You sell it all to me 
Liars,Liars 
I'm what you'll never be
