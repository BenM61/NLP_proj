I got a question for you
I got a question for you
Where did you get
Your name from?
Where did you get
Your name from?
I got a question for you
Where do you see yourself
In five minutes time?

With a laugh like that
Or a look like that
You make us all feel gauche
Like it's a sweaty joke but
With a laugh like that
And a look like that
You make us all just go
Whoa

Look out
You're what she came for
You're what she came for
No question, no doubt
You're what she came for
Knows what she came for
No question, no doubt

I got a question for you
Another question for you
Oh do you feel the
Do you feel the pressure
Why you're wearing
What you're wearing
Where will your life be gone
In five minutes time?

So say something stupid
You know that you love to

Look out
You're what she came for
You're what she came for
No question, no doubt
You're what she came for
You're what she came for
No question, no doubt

Whoa!

You're what she came for
You're what she came for

You're what she came for
You're what she came for
You're what she came for
