Hey good lookin' what cha got cookin'
How's about cookin' something up with me
I'm free and ready so we can go steady
How's about keepin' steady company

I got a hot rod Ford and a two dollar bill
And I know a spot right over the hill
There's soda pop and the dancin' free
But if you want to have fun
Come along with me

Hey good lookin' what cha got cookin'
How's about cookin' something up with me

I'm gonna throw my date book over the fence
And find me one for five or ten cents
I'll keep 'til it's covered with age
Because I'm writing your name
Down on ever page

Hey good lookin' what cha got cookin'
How's about cookin' something up with me
How's about cookin' something up with me
How's about cookin' something up with me
