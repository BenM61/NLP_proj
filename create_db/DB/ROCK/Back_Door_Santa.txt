I make my runs about the break of day
They call me the back door santa
I make my runs about the break of day

I make all the little girls happy
While the boys are out to play

I ain't like old Saint Nick
He don't come but once a year
I ain't like old Saint Nick
He don't come but once a year

I come a runnin' with my presents
Every time you call me, dear

I keep some change in my pocket
I chase the children home
I give them a few pennies
So that we can be alone

I leave the back door open
So if anybody smells the mouse
And wouldn't old Santa be in trouble
If there ain't no chimney in the house
