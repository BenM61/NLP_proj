The hidden - undiscovered,
It was the last stone to be turned,
A needle scratched the surface,
I don't know where it's gonna go.
I don't care,
Gotta lose myself to get somewhere,
But if I'm gone too long then
I might be a victim of that superstar
1000 yard stare.
(Cover my eyes and move, and we're still coming clear)
Well I have no direction,
No talking it out,
So what if I'm dead and shooting when I hear the sound?
Looming far from home... light years...
I'm deep in the stare and it comes back,
I never had the strength to let it go...
And it's taken some time... taken some time.
I figure I may never come back,
Until I have a faith so long and sure...
And's it's taking some time... taking some time.
There ain't nobody gonna wait too long,
There ain't nobody gonna wait ...
So long, so long, so long.
I don't care,
Gotta loose myself to get somewhere,
But if I'm gone too long then
I might be a victim of that superstar
1000 yard stare...
(Cover my eyes)
I wish they'd know...
(I don't care what's going on...)
I wish they'd know...
(Yeah the same thing's going on...)
