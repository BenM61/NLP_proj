You got the look
I like
You make the people stare
And it's getting me
In a state
You're going out
With someone
I don't approve of
And it's getting me
In a state
I see you in a restaurant
I want to hold you
I see you with your mother
I want to hold you
I see you when you don't see me
I want to hold you
I want to hold you
In my arms
And I want to
Love you
I want you
And I'm gonna try
I'm searching but
I don't
Know why I bother
''cause I've seen you
And you look 
Just right
