It's very ordinary for the secretary
To take a man away from his wife
Girls, we make it necessary for the secretary
To put a little joy in his life

She takes the time to listen
To what he has to say
While all you do is nag him
A thousand times a day

Her hair is always pretty
And her clothes are always stylish
But you greet him with your hair in rollers
And that's outdated and so childish

Oh, it's very ordinary for the secretary
To take a man away from his wife
We make it necessary for the secretary
To put a little joy in his life

Are you there when he needs you
Are your favors less than cute
And when he tries to love you
Do you find something else to do

Now the ordinary girl may not wear pearls
Or diamonds on each hand
Oh, but like the secretary, wooh
She knows how to please her man

Oh, it's not extraordinary for the secretary
To take a man away from his wife
You see, we make it necessary for the secretary
To put a little joy in his life, hey, hey

You see, life's a bowl of cherries
For all the secretaries, hey, hey

Oh, it's very ordinary, it's not extraordinary
Girls, don't be contrary or you'll make it necessary
Your life can be so merry just like the secretary
Life's a bowl of cherries
