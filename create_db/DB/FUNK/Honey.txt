Mmm...
Oh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...

I gave you my heart
And I gave you my time
I gave you all of my money
Anything to keep you satisfy, yeah, yeah

But the one thing I didn't count on
Is that you would do me so bad
If there's one thing I know I love you for sure
I don't understand why did you treat me so bad

Honey (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Honey baby (Honey baby)
Honey
Why do I love you so much
Honey
Why do I love you so much (Tell me, tell me, baby)

Honey
Honey baby
Honey
Why do I love you so much
Honey
Why do I love you so much (Oh...)

I gave you the world, baby
Anything that your heart desires
And I didn't ask for one thing in return
I was there for you right down to the wire

So why'd you have to draw me, baby
You did everything again
And where it's comin' from, and I still can't let go
I'm losin' my hair and I don't understand

Honey (Honey)
Honey baby (Honey baby)
Honey
Why do I love you so much
Honey
Why do I love you so much (Whoa, baby)

Honey
Honey baby
Honey
Why do I love you so much
Honey (Oh...oh...)
Why do I love you so much

I can understand if it wasn't good enough
I was too good to the end, much too good for you
Other folks say you just ain't no good
I try to let go, but I still need to know

Honey
Honey baby (Oh...oh...oh...oh...)
Honey
Why do I love you so much (Somebody tell me)
Honey (Oh...)
Why do I love you so much (Oh...oh...oh...oh...)

Honey (Honey)
Honey baby
Honey (Honey)
Why do I love you so much (So much)
Honey (So much, oh...yes)
Why do I love you so much (Love me, love me, love me, love me)

Honey (Oh)
Honey baby (And I get weak when I see you)
Honey (Mmm, hmm)
Why do I love you so much (Why do)
Honey
Why do I love you so much

Honey (Yeah)
Honey baby (Honey baby)
Honey (Honey)
