I can barely see you when I close my eyes
There's nothing left of you here
We had the time, we had the time
The things that we remember and do not regret
They don't mean a thing here
We had the time, we had the time

I'll be your guide
So you can see the other side
And I will never let you get away
Never let you get away
I'll hold your head
So you can see
Crossing your heart and hoping
To never let you get away
Never let you get away

Everything you prayed for is not overhead
No one else will save you
Make up your mind, make up your mind
Trust me when I tell you we are on our own
Overlap our fingers
And run through the pines, we'll run through the pines

I'll be your guide
So you can see the other side
And I will never let you get away
Never let you get away
I'll hold your head
So you can see
Crossing your heart and hoping
To never let you get away
Never let you get away

I'll be your guide
So you can see the other side
And I will never let you get away
Never let you get away
I'll hold your head
So you can see
Crossing your heart and hoping
To never let you get away
Never let you get away

Never let you get away
Never let you get away
Never let you get away
Never let you get away
