Free me
Can't you hear that's what I say
Free me
Anyhow or anyway

I hear a voice
Call in the night
Push on the brain
Fades with the light

And I've seen a face
With so many eyes
Out in the words
Know there lies

Can't you hear me say
Can't you hear me say
Can't you hear me say

Free me, free me
Inside I'm bleeding, can't you see
Free me
From all this pain and misery

I am a flame
But he held the fire
Call me a fool
Don't call me a liar

Take me to hell
And let me stay
Get back some prize
Well, I have to pay

Can't you hear me say
Can't you hear me say
Can't you hear me say

Free me

I lie awake
Burning inside
No where to run
And no where to hide

Old lady time
She's no friend to me
I feel her change
And she holds the key

Can't you hear me say
Can't you hear me say
Can't you hear me say

Free me, free me
Can't you hear that's what I say
Free me
Anyhow or anyway
