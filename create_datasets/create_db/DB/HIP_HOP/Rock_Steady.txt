Rock

I looked at you, you stole my heart
You were all that I anticipated
I wanted you, every part
But I knew love would be complicated

I begin to touch, but you wouldn't let it
It never seemed to be the right time
I started to give up down to the limit
And then you changed your mind, whoa

And we begin to rock steady
Steady rockin' all night long
And we begin to rock steady
Rockin' till the break of dawn

Rock (Ooh) steady
Steady rockin' all night long
Rock steady
Rockin' till the break of dawn

You looked at me, to my surprise
You were too anticipatin'
I should have known, it was in your eyes
That you were gettin' tired of waitin'

You wanted me so much, but I didn't get it
How could a fellow be so blind
I started to give up, but love wouldn't let it
Then you walked into my life

And we begin to rock steady
Steady rockin' all night long
And we begin to rock steady
Rockin' till the break of dawn

Rock (Ooh) steady
Steady rockin' all night long 
(All night long)
Rock steady
Rockin' till the break of dawn 
(Rockin' till the break of dawn)

Ooh dooba dooba da

Rock
(Steady, baby, rock steady, baby)
Ooh, rock
(Steady, baby, rock steady, baby)

Rock
Ooh, rock

You wanted me so much, but I didn't get it
How could a fellow be so blind
I started to give up, but love wouldn't let it
Then you walked into my life

And we begin to rock steady
Steady rockin' all night long
And we begin to rock steady
Rockin' 'till the break of dawn 
(Rockin' 'till the break of dawn)

Rock (Ooh) steady
Steady rockin' all night long 
(All night long)
Rock steady
Rockin' 'till the break of dawn 
(Everybody)

Rock (Steady rock) steady 
(St-st-st-steady rock)
Steady rockin' all night long 
(Everybody steady rockin')
Rock steady
Rockin' 'till the break of dawn 
(Rockin' 'till the break of dawn)

(Everybody steady rockin')
