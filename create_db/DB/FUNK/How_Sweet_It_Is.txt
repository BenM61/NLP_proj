How sweet it is to be loved by you
Yes, baby
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Ooh, baby

I needed the shelter of someone's arms
And there you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs
And there you were

With sweet love and devotion
Deeply touching my emotions
I want to stop and thank you baby
I want to stop and thank you baby

Hey now how sweet it is to be loved by you
Oh, baby, baby
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Yes, it is

Close my eyes at night
And wonder what would I be without you in my life
Everything was just a bore
All the things I did seems I've done them before

But you brightened up all my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways
I want to stop and thank you baby
I want to stop and thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you
Oh, yes it is baby
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Yes, it is baby

You were better to me than I've been to myself
For me there's you and nobody else
I want to stop and thank you baby
I want to stop and thank you baby

Oh, how sweet it is to be loved by you
Tell the truth, baby
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Well, it's like sugar for my soul
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Oh, yes, it is baby
