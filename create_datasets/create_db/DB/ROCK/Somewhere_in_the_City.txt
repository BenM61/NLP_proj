She's somewhere in the city and the clock has just struck nine
This great big city and I can't get her off my mind
I called her today but alas she never got back to me
Maybe I said something wrong or something is wrong with her message machine

She's somehere in the city with a glass of wine in her hands
This great big city with a lowdown sorry man
It's tearing me up bit by bit, the way she runs hot and cold
I so love her face but I sure worry about her soul

She's somewhere in the city, somewhere in the city
She's somehwere in the city but she might as well be somewhere on Mars
This great big city with it's nightlife, restaurants and bars
So many places in the city for someone to have a good time
On a night like this I feel like committing a crime

She's somewhere in the city, somewhere in the city
Somewhere in the city, somewhere in the city
