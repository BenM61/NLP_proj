I do admit, I've come to like the attention
The heavy look in your eyes
So break a piece off of my latest obsession
A taste of pure paradise

I like the buzz deep 'cause of what it does to me
I get a fuzzy feeling washing over me
I get a rush now honey when you're touching me
Is it love? Is it love? Is it love? Is it love?

I can't sleep, I can't think now
I can't breathe without you
Touching me, is it love or the drugs?
It's a buzz, buzz, buzz
I like it
I like it

Everybody's keeping their little secrets
Hidden in the bottom drawer
But when it's over there's a terrible fever
That keeps you begging for more

I like the buzz deep 'cause of what it does to me
I get a fuzzy feeling washing over me
I get a rush now honey when you're touching me
Is it love? Is it love? Is it love? Is it love?

I can't sleep, I can't think now
I can't breathe without you
Touching me, is it love or the drugs?
It's a buzz, buzz, buzz

Oh yeah (I like it)
What you're doing to me, baby (I like it)
Oh yeah (I like it)
Say, what you're doing to me

'Cause there's a new drug, baby, that I can't resist
It's like a thousand buzzing when we kiss
And can you show me now, how can I get my fix?
Is it love? Is it love? Is it love? Is it love?

Is it love? Is it love?
Or just the drugs pulsating my veins?
Is it love? Is it love?
Or just a buzz running to my brain?
I can't sleep, I can't think now
I can't breathe without you
Touching me, is it love or the drugs?
It's a buzz, buzz, buzz (I can't sleep)
(I can't breathe)
It's a buzz, buzz, buzz (I can't sleep)

(I like it)
