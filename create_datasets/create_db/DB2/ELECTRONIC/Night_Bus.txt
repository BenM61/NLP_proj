And you see trouble in her eyes
And you've noticed but only realized
It's not fading however hard you try
'Cause it's built in her for her life

I'm not alone
She said I'm not alone

And she takes the night bus home
She's not fazed by the darkness in her soul
And you barely catch a glimpse of her
'Cause she's wrapped tightly, hiding in her clothes

I'm not alone
She said I'm not alone
No, I'm not alone

Strangers and they're walking my way
And I'm talking to myself
Strangers and they're walking my way
And I'm talking to myself
Strangers and they're walking my way
And I'm talking to myself
Strangers and they're walking my way

She said I'm not alone
She said I'm not alone
She said I'm not alone
No, I'm not alone
