Got you on my mind
Feeling kinda sad and low
Got you on my mind
Feeling kinda sad and low
Wondering where you are
Wondering why you had to go

Tears begin to fall
Every time I hear your name
Tears begin to fall
Every time I hear your name
Since you went away, darlin'
Nothing ever seems the same
 
No matter how I try
My heart keeps telling me
I can't forget you
If it should ever be
That you'd want to come back to old Jerry Lee
Lord! I'm gonna let you

I got you on my mind
Feeling kinda sad and low
Got you on my mind
Feeling kinda sad and low
Wondering where you are
Wondering why you had to go
