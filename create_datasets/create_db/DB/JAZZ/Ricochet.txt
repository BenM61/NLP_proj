They warned me when you kissed me your love would ricochet
Your lips would find another and your heart would go astray
I thought that I could hold you with all my many charms
But then one day you ricocheted to someone else's arms

[Chorus:]
And baby
I don't want a ricochet romance, I don't want a ricochet love
If you're careless with your kisses, find another turtle dove
I can't live on ricochet romance, no, no not me
If you're gonna ricochet, baby, I'm gonna set you free

I knew the day I met you, you had a roving eye
I thought that I could hold you, what a fool I was to try
You promised you'd be faithful and you would never stray
Then like a rifle bullet, you began to ricochet

[Chorus]

When you announced our wedding, you made me mighty proud
I whispered two was company, but you preferred a crowd
You buzzed around the other girls just like a busy bee
And when you finished buzzing, cousin, you buzzed right back to me

[Chorus]

If you're gonna ricochet, baby, I'm gonna set you free
