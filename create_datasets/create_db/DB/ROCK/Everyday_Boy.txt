Well I've never met anyone
With your courage
And the way your enjoy life
Puts me to shame
Just an hour with you
And I understand
Why we had to meet

I saw you look in the mirror
And adjust your hair
Smile and leave the room

Just an everyday boy
Doing everyday things
But you're somebody special
Somebody who feels
You're not the first
And you won't be the last
But you are the one
I'll remember

It's god's revenge
You're surrounded by fear
A compassionate man
You hold people dear
No blame for the mother
Who curses your name
She fears for her son
It's death by association

But you respect yourself
And you let it show
Some fade with guilt
And the shame
They way you
Tell your story
With no tears
For yourself

Just an everyday boy
Doing everyday things
You're not the first
And you won't be the last
But you are the one
I'll remember

Hey hey
Just an everyday boy
Just an everyday boy

Doing everyday things
Just an everyday boy
Just an everyday boy
Just an everyday boy
Doing everyday things
Just an everyday boy
