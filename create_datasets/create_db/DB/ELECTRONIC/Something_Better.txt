I never met you, but I know you're out there
If I cross the oceans, would you be there?

A stranger's eyes that somehow look familiar
I know that when it's you, I'll remember
Remember

So wait for me, I swear I'll find you
Climbing every wall that hides you
I know we were meant for something better
So wait for me, the world is changing
Underneath, the ground is shaking
You and I were meant for something better
Better, oh

I swear I'll find you

I feel the wind move, we breathe the same air
You're like the best news that I can't share

A stranger's eyes that somehow look familiar (Somehow look familiar)
I know that when it's you, I'll remember
Remember

So wait for me, I swear I'll find you
Climbing every wall that hides you
I know we were meant for something better
So wait for me, the world is changing
Underneath, the ground is shaking
You and I were meant for something better
Better, oh

So wait for me, the world is changing
Underneath, the ground is shaking
You and I were meant for something better
Better, oh

I swear I'll find you
Meant for something better
Better, oh
