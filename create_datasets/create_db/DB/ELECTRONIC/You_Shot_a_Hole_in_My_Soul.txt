He's a midnight true romancer
He's the only, lonely dancer
Oh, only love breaks my heart
He is the nearest thing to heaven
Stole my heart
Try to save him
Oh, only love breaks my heart

You shot a hole in my soul
It's the countdown of love, I know
You shot a hole in my soul
Hold on tight, don't let go
You get always what you want from me (what you want)
You can make it easy, can't you see
You shot a hole, hole, hole
Hole in my soul

Dreams go on forever and ever
Good things do not last forever
Heaven can wait but I can't
Do that to me once again, babe
I think tomorrow it's too late, babe
Oh, only love breaks my heart

You shot a hole in my soul
It's the countdown of love, I know
You shot a hole in my soul
Hold on tight, don't let go
You get always what you want from me (what you want)
You can make it easy, can't you see
You shot a hole, hole, hole
Hole in my soul
