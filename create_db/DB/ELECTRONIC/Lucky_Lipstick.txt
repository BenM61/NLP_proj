Girls, ten-top red lip, girls
Showing off with a smile on their face
Looking at me
Looking at you
Looking at everyone

Girls, ten-top red lips, girls
Seeing straight with their bright eyes
Blinking day and night
Using it night and day

Girls, ten-top red lip

[Chorus]
A pretty face with colours clear and bright
Showing us how it's done
You look so good
So good, so good, come on, come on
Come on, come on!

Girls, ten-top red lip, girls
Fashion machines
With a new-wave thing
Working at day
Working at night
Working their whole life

Girls, ten-top red lip, girls
A fortune of looks with a lipstick in red
Looking at me
Looking at you
Looking at everyone

Girls, ten-top red lip

[Chorus]
