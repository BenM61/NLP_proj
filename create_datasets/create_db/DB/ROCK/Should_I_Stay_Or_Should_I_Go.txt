Should I stay or should I go?
If you say that you are mine
I'll be here till the end of time
So you got to let me know

You're happy when I'm on my knees
One day is fine, and next is black
So if you want me off your back
Well come on and let me know
Should I Stay or should I go?

Should I stay or should I go now?

If I go there will be trouble
And if I stay it will be double

And if I stay it will be double
Si me quedo va a ser doble
