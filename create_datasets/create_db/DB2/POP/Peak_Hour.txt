I see it all through my window it seems
Never failing like millions of bees
All that is wrong
No time will be won
All they need to do-o-o-o
What can be done? 

Peak hour, peak hour, peak hour

Minds are subject to what should be done
Problem solved, time cannot be won
One hour a day
One hour at night
Sees crowds of people
All meant for flight

Peak hour, peak hour, peak hour

It makes me want to run out and tell them
They've got time
Take a step back out
And look in at their debt
And their time

Minds are subject to what should be done
Problem solved, time cannot be won
One hour a day
One hour at night
Sees crowds of people
All meant for flight

Peak hour, peak hour, peak hour
