"When I'm worried,
And I can't sleep,
I count my blessings instead of sheep,
And I fall asleep,
Counting my blessings.

When my bankroll,
Is gettin' small,
I think of when
I had none at all.
And I fall asleep,
Counting my blessings.

I think about a nursery,
And I picture curly heads,
And one by one I count them,
As they slumber,
In their beds.

If you're worried,
And you can't sleep,
Just count your blessings instead of sheep,
And you'll fall asleep,
Counting your blessings.
