Darkness Darkness, be my pillow
Take my head and let me sleep
In the coolness of your shadow
In the silence of your deed

Darkness Darkness, hide my yearnin'
For the things I can not see
Eat my mind for constant turnin'
For the things I can not be

Darkness Darkness, be my blanket
Cover me with this endless night
Take away this state of lonely
Fill this emptyness with lightnin'

Emptyness with lightnin'

Darkness darkness, long and lonesome
Is the day that brings me here
I have found the heirs of sadness
I have known the grips of fear

Darkness darkness, be my blanket
Cover me with the endless night
Take away this pain I've known
Fill this emptyness with lightnin'

Emptyness with lightnin'

Darkness darkness, be my blanket
Cover me with the endless night
Take away this state of lonely
Fill this emptyness with lightnin'

Oh with lightnin

Darkness Darkness, be my pillow
Take my head and let me sleep
In the coolness of your shadow
In the silence of your deed

In the silence of your deed
