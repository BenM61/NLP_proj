I'm the oil upon the water,
I'm the lava in the flow
Resting like a rock beside the seaside
I'm the son and you're the daughter
Of the stranger that we know,
Who gets a little stoned beside the wayside

[Chorus]
Well, there's one thing to try
Everybody knows
Music gets you high
Everybody grows
And so it goes

You're the lips that make the laughter
You're the sunshine in the snow
Shining out on everything you feel
You're the bird that dropped the berry
On the island far below
Finding out that everything is real

[Chorus]

We are loved and we are lonely
We are many, we are few
Make it out of love and build a dream
We are hobos, we are holy
We are me and we are you,
Can't it be as easy as it seems?

[Chorus]
