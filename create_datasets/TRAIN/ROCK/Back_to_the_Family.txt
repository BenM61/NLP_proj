My telephone wakes me in the morning 
Have to get up to answer the call.
So I think I'll go back to the family
Where no one can ring me at all.

Living this life has its problems
So I think that I'll give it a break.
Oh, I'm going back to the family
'Cause I've had about all I can take.

Master's in the counting house
Counting all his money.
Sister's sitting by the mirror 
She thinks her hair looks funny.

And here am I thinking to myself
Just wondering what things to do.

I think I enjoyed all my problems
Where didn't I get nothing for free.
Oh, I'm going back to the family 
Doing nothing is bothering me.

I'll get a train back to the city
That soft life is getting me down.
There's more fun away from the family
Get some action when I pull into town.

Everything I do is wrong,
What the hell was I thinking?
Phone keeps ringing all day long
I got no time for thinking.

And every day has the same old way
Of giving me too much to do.
