No play or work all day
At the night time everyone deceive me
No time left for starlight
Ducking on the street light, dancing in the rain
They say don't you worry child,
But let it go, live it, not bury it under
Not us 'cause we've seen the light
So here we go living high, I hear the thunder

Hey
They say our youth will fade away
We're young and wild if only for today
Hey
Don't say our youth will fade away
Wanna run, wanna fly 'cause I've got the time to waste

Hey
They say our youth will fade away
We're young and wild if only for today
Hey
Don't say our youth will fade away
Wanna run, wanna fly 'cause I've got the time to waste
Oh oh oh
Wanna run, wanna fly, wanna run, wanna fly, 'cause I've got the time to waste
Oh oh oh
Wanna run, wanna fly, wanna run, wanna fly, 'cause I've got the time to waste

I'm lost in your red eyes, lost in all the good times
Written on your face
We good, got a lifetime riding on the sunrise
Something we can place
They say don't you worry child
But let it go, live it, not bury it under
Not us we've seen the light
So here we go living high, I hear the thunder

Hey
They say our youth will fade away
We're young and wild if only for today
Hey
Don't say our youth will fade away
Wanna run, wanna fly 'cause I've got the time to waste
Oh oh oh
We got the time, yeah
We got the time, oh, oh, oh
We got the time, yeah
We got the time

They say our youth will fade away
We're young and wild if only for today
But don't say our youth will fade away
Wanna run, wanna fly
Hey
They say our youth will fade away
We're young and wild if only for today
Hey
Don't say our youth will fade away
Wanna run, wanna fly 'cause I've got the time to waste
Oh oh oh
Wanna run, wanna fly, wanna run, wanna fly, 'cause I've got the time to waste
Oh oh oh
Wanna run, wanna fly, wanna run, wanna fly, 'cause I've got the time to waste
