They tried to kill us off 
But this show's not over 
Cos we were born to shine 
And thrill like supernova

So dry your tears don't cry now 
It's nowhere near the final curtain

[Chorus] 
Anything could happen
This world's uncertain
Anything could happen

Down every darkened street 
We'll search until we find them 
With knives between our teeth 
We'll creep up behind them 
Oh 'cos creatures of our kind will not give in 
Until the final curtain.

[Chorus]

I know you're hurting
Anything could happen
Anything could happen oh

I know you're hurting 
But anything could happen
This world's uncertain
Anything could happen

La la la la, la la, la la la la, la la [Repeat x2]
