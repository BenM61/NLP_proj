Stormy weather ahead and I don't know what to do
(Think about it baby)
World gone crazy we're beaten 'til we're black and we're blue
(Think about it baby)
Fear's in fashion, the writing on the wall is obscene
(Think about it baby)
Everybody's shouting but I don't really know what they mean

And the voices I hear are the voices inside of my head
It's a sign of the times maybe time to try something instead

Just a little love and the world keeps turning
Just a little love keeps our hearts from burning
Just a little love I believe we're yearning
Just a little love keeps the storm at bay
Just a little love not the hate that's calling
Just a little love and the walls start falling down
And I believe there are angels calling
Just a little love
Just a little love

I'm not sure that you love me like you loved me before
(Think about it baby)
Say that I'm crazy and maybe I would walk out the door
(Think about it baby)
Every time I consider it you always pull at my heart
(Think about it baby)
Tell me it's not the end that this is only the start

And the voices I hear are the voices inside my head
It's a sign of the times maybe time to try something instead

Just a little love and the world keeps turning
Just a little love keeps our hearts from burning
Just a little love I believe we're yearning
Just a little love keeps the storm at bay
Just a little love not the hate that's calling
Just a little love and the walls start falling down
And I believe there are angels calling
Just a little love
Just a little love

Just a little love
Just a little love
Just a little love
Just a little love
