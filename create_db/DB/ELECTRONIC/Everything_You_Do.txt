From the moment you looked at me 
And ever since you called my name 
You've been everything that I've seen 
And know I'm caught up in this game 

My mind is spinning round and around 
There's something special I have found 
Every time I close my eyes 
All I can think of is you and me 
Oh baby can't you see 

That everything you do 
Everything that you do 
Makes me want to go
Everything you say 
Everything that you say 
Makes me want to go

They're trying to build a fence 
By saying that this won't last 
They tell me I don't have a chance 
That everything moves too fast 

But every time I close my eyes 
All I can think of is you and me 
Oh baby can't you see 

That everything you do 
Everything that you do 
Makes me want to go
Everything you say 
Everything that you say 
Makes me want to go

That everything you do 
Everything that you do 
Makes me want to go
Everything you say 
Everything that you say 
Makes me want to go

My mind is spinning round and around 
There's something special I have found 
Every time I close my eyes 
All I can think of is you and me 
Oh baby can't you see 

That everything you do 
Everything you do 
Everything you do 
Everything you say 
Everything that you say 

That everything you do 
Everything that you do 
Makes me want to go
Everything you say 
Everything that you say 
Makes me want to go

That everything you do 
Everything that you do 
Makes me want to go
Everything you say 
Everything that you say 
Makes me want to go
