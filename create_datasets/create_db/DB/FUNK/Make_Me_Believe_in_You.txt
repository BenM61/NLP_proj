Ain't a girl to be found
Without a mouth [Incomprehensible]
You just remember from hip to the lip
Before you ask any questions

I ain't for no heart wrappin'
So you can stop with your eyelids slappin'
It's gonna be a real cryin' shame
If I find that you're playin' in a game

Make me believe in you
Show me your love can be true
Do anything you want me to do
Make me believe in you

Keepin' filled with all your temptation
You know it leaves me with no inspiration
Another chart playin' on me
May have a hard time succeedin', you see

You don't seem quite like the others
Respectin' me and your sisters and brothers
It would be awful, awful sad
To give love and you treat me so bad

Make me believe in you
Show me your love can be true
Do anythin' you want me to do
Make me believe, make me believe in you

Ain't no girl to be found
Without a mouth [Incomprehensible]
You just remember from hip to the lip
Before you ask any questions

I ain't for no heart wrappin'
So you can cut off that eyelids slappin'
Gonna be awful, awful sad
To give love and you treat it so bad

Make me believe in you
Show me your love can be true
Do anythin' you want me to do
Just make me believe
Make me believe, make me believe
