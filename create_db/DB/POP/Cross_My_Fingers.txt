Baby when I put my mind to it
I slip into another gear
And I travel in another syncopation
When all I want to be is here with you
And 

I'll be true to you cross my fingers
I'll be good to you cross my fingers
I'll be true to you cross my fingers 

Sure as a snake along the river
Sure as a ghost is in the trees
There is a promise love delivers
Even though you never promised me 

I'll be true to you cross my fingers
I'll be good to you cross my fingers
I'll be true to you cross my fingers 

I want to stay, 'til my thoughts are okay
'Til my motive is clear, 'cause I'm driftin away
From the weight of your arms, from your soft feather bed
To a cold white line down the highway in my head 

All our little tears are icicles
Hangin' on the telephone lines
And I call you up through all the cracklin' static
I swear I only hear you half the time
No matter how I try to hold you baby
You only seem to slip away from me
And then we're walkin out along the ocean
Or swimmin like the dolphins out to sea 

I'll be true to you cross my fingers
I'll be good to you cross my fingers
I'll be true to you cross my fingers
I'll be good to you cross my fingers 

Cross my fingers
