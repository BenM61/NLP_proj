When I heard you playing
Now you stole my heart away
Now you don't even notice me
So I just have to say now

[Chorus]
Blue Finger Lou
My woogie wants to boogie
With you

I know you carry on
Some here and then
You're gone
Some ladies all around you
But I bet your feeling
Lonesome

[Chorus]

You know I watch you
Every evening playing
Kitten on the keys
Wish you'd tickle me
Instead of your ivories

In my dreams of love
I seem to concentrate
On the peddle-pumping rhythm
Of the eighty-eight

You and I could
Harmonize
Cuddle up and
Improvise
Cut a rug
Or kiss and hug
Until we see the
Sun rise

[Chorus]

I gotta know
I gotta know
I gotta know

If I am ever gonna get
The chance to show you
How I'm feelin'
All the floozy thoughts
And thinkin'
Don't you know that it was
Me that bought the
Pink that you were
Drinkin'?

Really need a girl
Just like me to syncopate
To the peddle-pumping rhythm
Of the eighty-eight
You and I could
Harmonize
Cuddle up and
Improvise
Cut a rug
Or kiss and hug
Until we see the
Sun rise

[Chorus]

I gotta know
I gotta know
I gotta know

If I am ever gonna get
The chance to show you
How I'm feelin'
All the floozy thoughts
And thinkin'
Don't you know that it was
Me that bought the
Pink that you were
Drinkin'?

Really need a girl
Just like me to syncopate
To the peddle-pumping rhythm
Of the eighty-eight

You and I could
Harmonize
Cuddle up and
Improvise
Cut a rug
Or kiss and hug
Until we see the
Sun rise

[Chorus]

Yes, I do

Blue Finger Lou
My woogie wants to boogie
With you

[Chorus]
