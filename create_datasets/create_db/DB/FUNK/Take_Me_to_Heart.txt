Oh, the girls watched from their balconies
They filled the air with whispers
Of spite and petty jealousy
Like Cinderella's sisters

They say that if you stay with me
Your heart will soon be broken
Their bitter words must go unheard
As if they've never spoken

I love you for better and for worse
Girl, you are my whole universe
Ever since we've been together
Since we've been together

You're my one lover
My best friend
I'll never say this is the end
I married you forever

Take me to heart
When I say I'll never leave you
Take me to heart
When I say I'll always love and need you

I'll love you 'til my final breath
'Til death do us part
Don't forsake me
Baby, take me to heart

Take me to heart
Take me to heart
Take me to heart
Take me

In the past you'd always find me
In some sticky situation
I thought that playing fast and free
Enhanced my reputation

Oh, but I was wrong, the past has gone
It's ancient history now
We pledged our love to build upon
And never disavow

I love you for better and for worse
Girl, you are my whole universe
Ever since we've been together
Since we've been together

You're my one lover
My best friend
I'll never say this is the end
I married you forever

Take me to heart
When I say I'll always love you
Take me to heart
When I say there is no one above you

I'll love you 'til my final breath
'Til death do us part
Don't forsake me
Baby, take me to heart

Take me to heart
Take me to heart
Take me to heart
Take me to heart

Take me to heart
Take me to heart
Take me to heart
Take me to heart

Take me to heart
Take me to heart
Take me to heart
Take me to heart

Take me to heart
Take me to heart
Take me to heart
Take me to heart
