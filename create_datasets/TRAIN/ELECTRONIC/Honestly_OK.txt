I just want to feel safe in my own skin
I just want to be happy again
I just want to feel deep in my own world
But I'm so lonely I don't even want to be with myself anymore

On a different day if I was safe in my own skin
Then I wouldn't feel lost and so frightened
But this is today and I'm lost in my own skin

And I'm so lonely I don't even want to be with myself anymore

(Now your safe, oh oh)
(How I feel, oh oh)

And I'm so lonely I don't even want to be with myself anymore

(Now your safe, oh oh)
And I'm so lonely I don't even want to be with myself anymore
(How I feel, oh oh)

I just want to feel safe in my own skin
I just want to be happy again
