Baby, baby, baby
You got me crying in my sleep
Baby, baby, baby
You got me crying in my sleep

Oh, you let the other fellows
Steal your love away from me

One more time now

Baby, baby, baby
I wake up calling out your name
Baby, baby, baby
I wake up calling out your name

Oh, you got me so unhappy
And, honey
You're the one to blame

Let me tell you about it

I gave you time, I gave you love
I thought we went together
Like a hand and glove

You took my love
You took my time
And now you make me think
You're trying to take my mind

Baby, baby, baby
Why don't you stop your evil way
And, oh, you're making me unhappy
You got me crying night and day

Let me tell a story

I try to go to sleep at night
But all I do is toss and turn
Til broad daylight

My pillow's wet
From crying tears
I feel a little better
When your picture's near

Baby, baby, baby
I got your picture in my arms
I've giving it my kisses and
My love until you come
But meanwhile

Baby, baby, baby
You got me crying in my
My, my, my, my, my, my sleep
Baby, baby, baby
You got me crying in my sleep
Oh, yes you have

Cause you let the other fellows
Steal your love away from me

One more time now

Baby, baby, baby
You got me crying in my sleep
Baby, baby, baby
