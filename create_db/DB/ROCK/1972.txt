She was feelin' 1972
Groovin' to a Carole King tune
Is it too late baby?
It it too late?

That boy was always up to no good
Smokin' pot and playin' pool
In the afternoon
Unemployed and high

We're goin' through the changes
Hopin' for replacement
Until we find a way out of this hole

Spanish girl with the tatoo
Workin' nights at the drive-through
And she asks herself
Could this be all?

Screwin' in a motel room
Watchin' news on channel two
Victoria tell me
Where is your dream?

We're going through the changes
Hopin' for replacement
Until we find a way out of this

We're going through the changes
Hopin' for replacement
Until we find a way out of this

A way out of this hole
Out of this hole
Out of this hole
Oh
Oh
