What do you think I feel when I, when I, take it with you?
What do you think I see when I, when I, take it with you?
Somewhere else, somewhere, somewhere else
Somewhere else, somewhere else

What do you think I feel when I, when I'm kissing you?
Somewhere else, somewhere, somewhere else
Somewhere else, somewhere,  somewhere else

"We're walking in the streets, or what's left of them,
I take your hand, and the city is slowly vanishing.
There's no crowd anymore, no cars, no signals.
But in the middle of the road, a purple and mellow shape is floating.
The shape of our mutual dream.
Stay calm, hold me tight, give it a chance to take us away."

We will live, we will dream on the shadow of our world.
We will live, we will dream on the shadow of our world.

We will live, we will dream on the shadow of our world.
