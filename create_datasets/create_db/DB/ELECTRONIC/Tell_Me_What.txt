Tell me what, tell me what
Tell me what I've got to do 

To make you notice, to make you look this way
What do I have to say 
Tell me what, tell me what I have to say 

To keep you with me, to make you want to stay
To have you every day 
Tell me what, tell me what I gotta do 

Are you happy, I can never tell
You keep it to yourself 

Tell me what, tell me what it is you feel 

Do you get frightened
Am I comin' on, just a little too strong
And you're so quiet, I never know or not
If I'm right or wrong 

Tell me what, tell me what
Tell me what I gotta do 

Is there something I ought to be told
Do you want to go 
Tell me what, tell me what it is you know 

So it's over, then we're really through?
What I heard is true 
Tell me what, tell me what your gonna do 

To keep you with me, to make you want to stay
Too have you every day 
Tell me what, tell me what I've gotta do
