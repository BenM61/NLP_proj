What about the one who said he loved you
What about the one who said he cared
Don't bother trying to find him
Way up in the icy air 

O you played with his heartstrings
And you played without a care
But not up in the high sierra
You won't play his heart out there 

The angels lay their clouds across his sky
They line up for him every night
Some have wings and others sing
The rest do lazy ballets in the air

There he's got a bird to give him warning
And he's got a lookout too
The beauty of the high sierra
And she's looking out for you

What about the one who said he loved you
What about the one who said he cared
He's off in the high sierra
But don't bother looking there
