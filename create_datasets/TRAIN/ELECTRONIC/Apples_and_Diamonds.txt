Although
I know
The way to your door I won't go
Cause once you get me spinning
There's nothing I want to know
Cause I've got apples and diamonds
To last me a year
So frankly I'm quite comfortable here
But if you whisper my name and promise you won't cling
Maybe it wouldn't be so bad
With a fling
You say you've changed your name
You say that nothing will ever be the same
And you hold my head so tight
It would be useless to fight
Cause I've got apples and diamonds to last me a year
So frankly I'm quite comfortable here
But if you whisper my name and promise you won't cling
Maybe it wouldn't be so bad
With a fling
Although
I know the way to your door
I won't go
Cause once I get under your covers
There's nothing I want to know
Cause I've got apples and diamonds to last me a year
So frankly, I'm quite comfortable here
But if you whisper my name and promise you won't cling
Maybe it wouldn't be so bad
With a fling

But if you whisper my name and promise you won't cling
