I've been in nines and tens
Some come around again
I've seen a dime or two
They don't compare to you
So many things I like
Too many to even name
I wanna be your man
I hope you feel the same

[Bridge]
Baby, all I wanna do is hold you
And show you how much I adore you
Want you, need you, baby

[Chorus]
You're, you're my favorite girl
Baby, you're the only one
I wanna give you the world, yeah
You're, you're my favorite girl
You really, really got it goin' on
Everything that a man could want
You're my favorite girl

(You're my favorite girl, uh-huh)

Girl, I'm not playin' games
I've been with other dames
I figure 'what's the use?'
There's really no excuse
Many good qualities
I can't think of one complaint
That's why you're number one
And all the others ain't love

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

You're everything a man like me could ever want
Give me what I need and nothing that I don't
Girl, I promise that I will always have your back
You're all I need
You're my favorite girl

[Chorus x 2]

You're my favorite girl
You're my favorite girl
You're my favorite
