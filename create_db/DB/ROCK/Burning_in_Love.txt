What did I say to you, what did you see me do
That made ya turn to stone overnight
I thought I played it right
Lovin' you deep in the night
The chain of love is broken now
Why can't we start again
'Cause my heart won't mend
But you say no, then you go, and I break down

I'm still a lonely man burning in love
I'm still a lonely man burning in love

What did he say to you
What did he promise you
That made you change from white to black
I don't understand it
It seems so underhanded
I want to hate you but I'm still in love
Why can't we start again,
'Cause my heart won't mend
But you say no, then you go
And I break down

I'm still a lonely man burning in love
I'm still a lonely man burning in love

Why can't we start again
'Cause my heart won't mend
But you say no, then you go
And I break down

I'm still a lonely man burning in love
I'm still a lonely man burning in love

I'm still a lonely man burning in love
I'm still a lonely man burning in love

Burning in love
Burning, burning in love
Burning in love
Burning in love
