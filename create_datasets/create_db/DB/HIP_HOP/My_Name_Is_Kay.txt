I like tricky's and go trains
I put rum in my lemonade

Eating crumpets and marmalade
Yeah I trip to my own beach
Panda slippers on two foot
I can walk on my hands too
Yeah boy I know wanna buy me a drink

You, you don't know shit about me
I'm a pimp, 24-7 on gin

I was awoken in the morning
By a fantastic aroma
If rhymes could kill I will put you in a coma
Da da ding ding what what ring a mobile phone-a
It's this guy named Drew
Hey he wants to come right over
Let 'em in, let 'em in, let 'em in, no way
Did he just called me Sarah when he knows my name is Kay
Yup, yup, giddy up, hit the road
That's what's up, that's what's up, that's what's s-s-s su' sunup

Asking stupid questions like

That is Nova Scotian that you mad don't trip
I can spell it out just in case you forget
