I've got a gal here in this town
Don't want nobody to bother but me
I've got a gal here in this town
Don't want nobody to bother but me

'Cause she's strickly, tailor made
Boy, she ain't no hand me down
Catch you messin' with her, boy

Now, keep yo' hands off her
Don't ya dare to touch her
You know she don't belong to you
You know she don't belong to you

Oh, keep yo' hands off her
Now, don't ya dare to touch her
Know she don't belong to you

Keep yo' hands off her
Told ya don't ya dare to touch her
Know she don't belong to you

She got some little bitty hands
An them great big legs
She sho' look good
'Cause everybody says it

But keep yo' hands off her
Don't ya dare to touch her
You know she don't belong to you
Told you last night
You know she don't belong to you

Oh, keep yo' hands off her
Now, don't ya dare to touch her
Know she don't belong to you

Keep yo' hand off her
Now, don't ya dare to touch her
Know she don't belong to you

She got some real dark eyes
An that real curly hair
Big Bill, is gonna follow
That woman everywhere

Keep yo' hands off her
Told ya, don't ya dare to touch her
You know she don't belong to you
Told you last night
You know she don't belong to you

Keep yo' hands off her
Don't ya dare to touch her
Know she don't belong to you

Keep yo' hands off her
Don't ya dare to touch her
Know she don't belong to you

Now you can look her up
An' you can look her down
She got a heaven, boy
Ain't never been found

But keep your hands off her
Don't ya dare to touch her
You know she don't belong to you
You know she don't belong to you

Oh, keep your hands off her
Don't ya dare to touch her
Know she don't belong to you

Keep yo' hands off her
Told ya dare to touch her
Know she don't belong to you

Oh, watch her, boy
Right as she pass by
Because the day I'll catch you wit' her
Boy, that's the day you gon' die

Keep yo' hands off her
Told ya dare to touch her
You know she don't belong to you
Know she don't belong to you
