I am not senorita 
I am not from your tribe 
In the garden I did no crime 
I am not your senorita 

I am not from your tribe 
If you want inside her well  
Boy you better make her raspberry swirl 
Things are getting desperate 

When all the boys can't be men 
Everybody knows I'm her friend 
Everybody knows I'm her man 
I'm not your senorita 

I don't aim so high 
In my heart I did no crime 
If you want inside her well, 
Boy you better make her raspberry swirl
