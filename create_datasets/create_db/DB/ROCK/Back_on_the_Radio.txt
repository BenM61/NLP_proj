Someone found a letter you wrote me
On the radio
And they told the world just how you felt
It must have fallen out of a hole
In your old brown overcoat
They never said your name
But I knew just who they meant

I was so surprised and shocked
And I wondered, too
If by chance you heard it for yourself
I never told a soul
Just how I've been feeling about you
But they said it really loud
They said it on the air
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Now, now

Don't it kinda strike you sad
When you hear our song
Things are not the same
Since we broke up last June
The only thing that I wanna hear
Is that you love me still
And that you think
You'll be comin' home real soon
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, you kinda made me feel proud
When I heard him say
You couldn't find the words to say it yourself
And now in my heart I know
I can say what I really feel
'Cause they said it really loud
They said it on the air
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
On the radio
Whoa, oh
Oh, oh, on the radio

If you think that love isn't found on the radio
Then tune right in you made find the love you lost
'Cause now I'm sitting here
With the man I sent away long ago
Hefound it really loud
They said it really loud
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
On the radio
