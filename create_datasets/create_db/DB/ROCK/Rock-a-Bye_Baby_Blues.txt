I got the rock a bye baby blues
Baby's out a rocking with somebody new
Leaving me, with the rock a bye baby blues

I tried to rock a bye someone else
Baby I was only just fooling myself
Sit alone with the rock a bye baby blues

Oh, the rocking chair has got me
I just sit and cry
Rocking and a moaning got no baby to the rock a bye

I got the rock a bye baby blues
Baby I rock that's why I can't lose
Please don't leave rock a bye baby blues

Oh, the rocking chair has got me
I just sit and cry
Rocking and a moaning got no baby to the rock a bye

I got the rock a bye baby blues
Baby I rock that's why I can't lose
Please don't leave rock a bye baby blues
