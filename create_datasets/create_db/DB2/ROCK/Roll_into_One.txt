If I could make you mine
We could spend some time 
Maybe you could come around in the weekend 
Summer's rolling by and we don't have much time 
Tell me all about what keeps you ticking

We could sit in the sun 
Let the days all roll into one 
How could you take so long to decide? 
How would you know until you tried?

Say what's on you mind
Don't be so unkind 
If you believe in stupid things like love

We could sit in the sun
Let the days all roll into one 
How could you take so long to decide? 
How would you know until you tried?
We could sit in the sun 
Let the days all roll into one 
How could you take so long to decide? 
How would you know until you tried?

Tried, tried if you tried If you tried, if you tried
Lalala...
