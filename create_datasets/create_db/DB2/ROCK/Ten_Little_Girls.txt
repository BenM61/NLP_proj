You think of no one but yourself
You see the rest of us as fools
He said
Don't feel guilty
Don't go crazy
Don't get paranoid with me
You play the prophet like a man
Makes no sense in the overall master plan
She said
Don't feel guilty
Don't go crazy
Don't get paranoid with me
The arrogance
Microphone
Know
As the fear starts to grow inside
See what it's like to feel alive
Nothing is right
You thought it was
You know the cause what he had
My friend is lost, drifting away
And I feel I could play another day
Like I (go) my friends like I (go)
It doesn't matter what I say
You can push your (luck)
Don't go crazy
Don't feel
Don't get

Take you down with the sound
Know that the time has passed
You climb into another rhyme designed too fast

It doesn't matter how
Now you find out you were younger then
Looking back
Don't have to pretend
That it was you who was not
That's what you got
Nostalgic
That's right, Jack
The arrogance
Flapjack

Come along too strong
Ah hah, but you know
And now you realize all the lies
Wise up
'Cause my eyes can see the truth, reality
Ten little girls come out to play
They didn't stand a chance 
They got blown away (say it isn't so)
Ten little boys come out to play
They didn't stand a chance 
They got blown away (say it isn't so)
Nine little girls got blown away (no, no, no, no)
They didn't even have their own place to stay (say it isn't so)
Nine little boys got blown away (no, no, no, no)
They didn't even have their own place to stay (say it isn't so)
Arrogance
The arrogance
