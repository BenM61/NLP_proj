All my friends are revealed
As no one in the sun
And all light was concealed
Otherwise undone

All my hopes are laid bare
Like smoke dreams in a chair
All the plans for escape
All the faith

And all my time has run out
Just seconds in a jar
All the nights that I owned
In Saxony and Cuba

All my faith has been lost
Like people in a flood
All the flesh that I knew
All the blood

All my friends are revealed
As no one in the sun
And all light was concealed
Otherwise undone

Can you ever forgive me and trust me?
