How can I touch you
So far away
I miss you more than
These words can say
I know you're lonely but
So am I
But when temptation calls you
Remember you're my guy

Save your love
My love
Save it just for me
Save it up
Every drop
Till you're here with me
Save it all
Don't you fall
To my heart be true
Cause I'm savin' my love for you

You know I trust you
With all my heart
Still I get jealous
When we're apart
It's only human
We're gonna flirt
But if you get too friendly
Baby, I'll get hurt

Save your love
My love
Save it just for me
Save it up
Every drop
Till you're here with me
Save it all
Don't you fall
To my heart be true
Cause I'm savin' my love for you
(Bridge:)
Kenny called me late last night baby
Hopin' he could steal my heart away
I'll keep hangin' up on him
All that I'm askin' is you do the same

Save your love
My love
Save it just for me
Save it up
Every drop
Till you're here with me
Save it all
Don't you fall
To my heart be true
Cause I'm savin' my love for you
