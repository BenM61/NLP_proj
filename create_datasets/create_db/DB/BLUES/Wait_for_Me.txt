Wait for me
You know I love you so
Tell tell me baby
That you don't have to go
But if I if I don't see you no more
Just remember who was who walked out the door

It's so true
That parting is such a sweet sorrow
No way oh you may not be back tomorrow'
But if you ever change your mind
Call me up call me up anytime

I wait for the day
Oh when you don't feel this way
I'm gonna hold you
Oh I'm gonna hold you so close
Don't try to analyze
I'm gonna get to you

It's so true
That parting is such a sweet sorrow
No way oh you may not be back tomorrow'
But if you ever change your mind

Call me up call me up anytime
Away from me
Away from me
Leave me
Leave me
Somebody anybody 
Somebody anybody 
Somebody please wait for me
