I don't know why
I even try to be simple
When all I find
Is everything complicated

When I left home
I found the holes in my pockets
My parents smiled
They didn't know I was frightened

Try to start a life
Try to make a point
Try to start a life
It's harder than you think

As I shoved off
I took a good look behind me
My tether gone
A greater binding awaiting

Try to start a life
Try to make a point
Try to start a life
It's harder than you think

Try to start a life
Try to make a point
Try to start a life
Thought I heard the shot

But I cannot tell
Think that I can run
But I cannot tell
Wish I had it made
But I cannot tell what I do not know

Still I press on
Into the ground I am keeping
With any luck
I hope to make an arrangement

Try to start a life
Try to make a point
Try to start a life
It's harder than you think

Try to start a life
Try to make a point
Try to start a life
It's harder than you think

Try to start a life
Try to start a life
Try to start a life
Try to start a life
