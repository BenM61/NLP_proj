Now my heart begins to bleed
Dee dee dee dee dee ooh oh
Who will find me
Take care and side with me

Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee
Where has all our loving gone
Who will find me
Come and stand beside me
Guide me back
Safely to my home
Where I belong
Once more

Who will find me
Take care and side with me
Guide me back
Safely to my home
Where I belong
Once more (oooooooh)
