I heard this music while driving down the street
driving kind of slow when this rhythm hit my feet
my feet began to pat to this rock and roll jive
before i knew what happend I was doing 95

Tell it to the judge boys
Tell it to the judge

give me a break, I'm just learning to drive
I put the foot on the gas and it jumped to 95
believe me when I say it won't happen again
give me a break and I'll drive around the bend

Tell it to the judge boys
Tell it to the judge

after school you hit the strip
along the big highway
50 cents of gas is all you need
and soon you're on your way

officer won't you give me another chance
i'm driving with my trying to make her dance
believe when i say it won't happen again
give me a break and i'll drive around the bend

Tell it to the judge, boys
Tell it to the judge

Tell it to the judge, boys
Tell it to the judge
