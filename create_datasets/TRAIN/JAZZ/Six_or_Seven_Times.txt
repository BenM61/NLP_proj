St. Louis woman, she's never pleased,
She says there's one good man who'll soon be deceived,
If she can't hear from him each night at least
Six or seven times.

She says the other songs don't mean a thing,
There's only one that makes her heart go bing,
That's why she craves that little tune I sing
Six or seven times.
