Oh!

Whoa
Far beyond the reach of prediction
Lies a promise of a break in the code
And the truth untold
Just before the black swan rises
The horizon will be invisible
As the events unfold
Unfold, oh no

The explosion fathers away
Consequence we'll take to the grave
To the grave!
Take to the grave!
Take to the grave

Far beyond the realm of perception
Our assumptions dissipate in the flood, and in turn destroyed
Everything seems to be constant
Shifts direction and divides what we know
Everything that we hold so close

The explosion fathers away (the explosion fathers away)
Consequence we'll take to the grave (take to our graves)
What we'll never anticipate (what we'll never anticipate)
Consequence we'll take to the grave
To the grave!
Take to the grave!
Take to the grave
To the grave!
To the grave!

Aahh!
Yeah!
Unexpected the impact of once it come
Everlasting the fall that will carry on
Waiting quietly, be on the hexagon
To unravel the cannon bearing the one

The explosion fathers away (the explosion fathers away)
Consequence we'll take to the grave (take to your graves)
What we'll never anticipate (what we'll never anticipate)
Consequence we'll take to the grave
To the grave!
Take to the grave!
Take to the grave
To the grave!
To the grave!
