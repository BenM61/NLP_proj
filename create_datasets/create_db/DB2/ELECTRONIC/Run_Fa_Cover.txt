Every single day the rain it falls 
Drops on your head it breaks the balls 
Better run fa cover just to stay dry 
Better run fa cover I'll tell you why 

Lyric a danger an lyric a conquer man 
Lip dem a labba like politician man 
Heavy heavy and chatty chatty 
You better run fa cover an protect you body 
Can shower shower every hour hour 
A man dem a chat when dem mouth it sour 
Bring a umbrella an don:t labba labba 
'Cause I man a di super who you better follow 

Nuff of the rain keep falling nah mi head 
Oat a the reason why me build the red dread 
Lyrically wicked lard you must understand 
Born and raised in Nottingham 
Drip drop drip drop by you no me cy stop 
Listen reggae music an mi listen to me hip hop 
Flip flop still rock lyrical sure shot 
Run fa cover before you catch cold 

Every single day the rain it falls 
Drops on your head it breaks the balls 
Better run fa cover just to stay dry 
Better run fa cover I'll tell you why 
When you take a look at the way the rain falls 
Words are the very same thing 
Singing n the rain cannot be the song for we 
So listen to this thing that we bring 

I man a trickle but me soon hail stone 
Damager damager of a bad man soul 
Ca rain a fall an breeze a blow an 
Chicken batty deh outta door 
Don't bother worry don't bother fret 
Don't bother get uptight don't bother get upset 
Ca lyric ago shower so you better watch out 
Lyric ago shower so you better watch out
