As I sit... In my four cornered room
As I sit... In my four cornered room

I knew we met each other this morning for a reason
Thinking, talking, we've worked out our problems
Looked like we should have better days in front
Just because we took our time to think and talk
For a much better understanding

As I sit... In my four cornered room
As I sit... In my four cornered room
As I sit... In my four cornered room
As I sit... In my four cornered room

As we sit here in my four cornered room
I can feel all y'allz deepest emotions
I know I can't talk right
But I'm feeling something in the depths of my soul
I can understand where you're coming from
Y'all coming from my four cornered room
That four cornered room y'all
