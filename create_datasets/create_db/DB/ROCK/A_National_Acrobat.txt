I am the world that hides the universal secret of all time
Destruction of the empty spaces is my one and only crime

I've lived a thousand times
I found out what it means to be believed
The thoughts and images
The unborn child who never was conceived

When little worlds collide 
I'm trapped inside my embryonic cell
And flashing memories
Are cast into the never ending well

The name that scorns the face 
The child that never sees the cause of man
The deathly darkness that
Belies the face of those who never ran
You got belive it, I'm talking to you
Well I know its hard for you to know the reason why
And I know you'll understand when it's time to die
Don't believe the life you have will be the only one
You have to let your body sleep to let your soul live on

I want you to listen, I'm trying to get throught 
Love has given life to you and now its your concern
Unseen eye of inner life will make your soul return
Still I look but not to touch 
The seeds of life are sown
Curtain of the future falls
The secret stays unknown

Just remember love is life
And hate is living death
Treat your life for what its worth 
And live for every breath
Looking back I've lived and learned
But now I'm wondering 
Here I wait and only guess
What this next life will bring

Ha ha
