Listen everybody, especially you girls
Is it right to be left alone while the one you love is never home?
I love too hard, my friends sometimes say
But I believe, I believe that a woman should be loved that way

But it hurts me so inside
To see her treat me so unkind
Somebody, somewhere tell her it's unfair

Can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness?
Somebody

Is it right to be treated so bad
When you've given everything you had?
Even tossin' in my sleep
'Cause I haven't seen my baby all week

Now, you chicks do agree
That this ain't the way love's supposed to be
Let me hear, let me hear you say yeah, yeah

Up early in the morning with her on my mind
Just to find out all night that I've been cryin'
But I believe a woman's a man's best friend
So I'm gonna stick by her till the very end

But she causes so much misery
That I forget how love is supposed to be
Somebody, somewhere, tell her it ain't fair, can I get witness?

Can I get a witness?
I want a witness
Witness, witness
Witness, witness

Everybody knows, especially you girls
Love can be sad but I have a love that's twice as bad

Now all you chicks agree
That this ain't the way it's supposed to be
Let me hear you, let me hear you say yeah, yeah

I want a witness
I want a witness
I want a witness
I want a witness
Just a little bit louder
Louder yeah, oh yeah
