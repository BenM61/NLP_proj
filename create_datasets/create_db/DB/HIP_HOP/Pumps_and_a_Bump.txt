Just when I thought did I hit another soft spot
Up jumped the stiggities with the pumps and a bump
Boy! Stiggitty stiggity girls, getting on my good nerves 
Looking like ice cream ready to be served
Stretch it, bend it, could I get in it
If you wanna kick it with a 'g' baby bend it
'Cause I come equipped, read my lips, baby 
You can slippity slip out ya clothes and take a trip

Pumps and a bump, now many say a big butt
But if you're hip you know that it's a phone crud
It's making the brothers go crazy in the 9-3 
Shake like an hour glass, fine as wine 'g'
So when I say "i got a step" (it's a fine thing)
Never been a coward (cause it's a eastside thing)
Just step right up to the girl with the big back
Tell her what up, yo, the pumps and a bump

All that we want for the rest of our life is a girl big and tight! Ladies! 
All that we want is a man who is right who can hit it all night! 
We go the pumps and the bumps!

I don't like 'em stiggity fat! (No!) I like 'em stiggity stacked (yeah!)
You wiggity wiggity wack if you ain't got biggity back (aw!)
The way you see the rump shaking on the dance floor
Your bottle would hit your eyes and get hypnotized
But a brotha like me will dance up to some chopping and chewing
Keep em bottling you know I keep 'em bobbing 
I put my fingerprints all over that rump
I'm guilty as hell but I love the pumps and the bump! (Ow!)
