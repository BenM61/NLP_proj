We've entered the shadow zone

I see your bleeding dark side 
I feel your angry heart 
Reveals forbidden places 
More monster yet alive 

No faith 
Changing into something less than human 
No longer part of this 
The influence 
Changing into something less than human 
No longer part of this machine 
No mind 
Changing into something less than human 
No longer part of this machine 
It's chemical 
Changing into something less than human 
No longer part of this machine 

Get into my hidden demon 
Get out of my swollen head 
Shines down on blackened faces 
Changing at your expense

No faith 
Changing into something less than human 
No longer part of this 
The influence 
Changing into something less than human 
No longer part of this machine 
No mind 
Changing into something less than human 
No longer part of this machine 
It's chemical 
Changing into something less than human 
No longer part of this machine
