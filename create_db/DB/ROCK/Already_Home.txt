I can see the sunshine
Coming through my room
Breaking down the winter of my discontent
Looking out my window

At the people passing by
I keep wondering where my old companion went

On the steps of the museum
I wrote a line or two
But it took a while to find my way
Back to something true like

[Chorus]
This is where I lay my hat
This is where they know my name
This is where they show me that
A man's not so alone
Maybe I'm already home
(Sometimes you've got to go back)
Maybe I'm already home
(Sometimes you don't know why)

Rolling down the window
Burning up the daze
Cutting through the veil that keeps on blinding me
I was only sleeping
Waiting here for you
Waiting for your touch that keeps reminding me

Well I've seen the world of wonders
Been underneath it too
But it took a while just to find my way
Back to something true like

[Chorus]

Why it had to take me so long
Just to find a place that really feels
This must be where I belong
Thinking about it
All I had to do was click my heels

[Chorus]
