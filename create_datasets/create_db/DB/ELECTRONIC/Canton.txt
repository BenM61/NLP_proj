We're pushing through these farming towns
We worked hard ploughing over ground
Red army calls you the call of the crowd
Red army needs you they call you now

Cantonese boy
Bang your tin drum
Cantonese boy
Civilian soldier

Cantonese boy
Bang your tin drum
Cantonese boy
Red army calls you home

We're singing marching through the hills
We're changing the lives we've led for years
Red army calls you the call of the crowd
Red army needs you they call you now

Cantonese boy
Bang your tin drum
Cantonese boy
Civilian soldier

Cantonese boy
Bang your tin drum
Cantonese boy
Red army calls you home

Red army calls you
Red army needs you

Gentlemen you heard us call
Raised your glass and called for more
Only young men broke the wall
