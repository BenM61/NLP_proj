I settled down
A twisted up frown
Disguised as a smile, well
You would have never known

I had it all
But not what I wanted
Cause hope for me
Was a place uncharted
And overgrown

You'd make your way in
I'd resist you just like this

You can't tell me to feel
The truth never set me free
So, I did it myself

You can't be too careful anymore
When all that is waiting for you
Won't come any closer
You've got to reach out a little more
More
More
More, more

Open your eyes like I opened mine
It's only the real world,
A life you will never know

Shifting your weight
To throw off the pain
Well You can ignore it
But, only for so long

You look like I did
You resist me just like this

You can't tell me to heal
And, it hurts remembering
How it felt to shut down

You can't be too careful anymore
When all that is waiting for you
Won't come any closer
You've got to reach out a little more
More
More
More, more

The truth never set me free
The truth never set me free
The truth never set me free
So, I'll do it myself

You can't be too careful anymore
When all that is waiting for you
Won't come any closer
You've got to reach out

Can't be too careful anymore
When all that is waiting for you
Won't come any closer
You've got to reach out
More
More
More
More, more
