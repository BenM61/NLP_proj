Just when things are getting complicated in the eye of the storm
She flicks a red-hot revelation off the tip of her tongue
It does a dozen somersaults and it leaves you supercharged
Makes me wanna blow her candles out just to see if you glow in the dark

Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala

Home sweet home, home sweet home, home sweet booby-trap
I took the batteries out my mysticism and put 'em in my thinking cap
She's got a telescopic hallelujah hanging up on the wall
For when it gets too complicated in the eye of the storm

Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala

Oh, and in a hellcat spangled cavern
When your judgment's on the run
And you're acting like a stranger
'Cause you thought it looked like fun

Well did you ever get the feeling
Did you think she set the fall
Her steady hands may well have done the devil's pedicure
What you waiting for to sing another fuckin'

Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala
