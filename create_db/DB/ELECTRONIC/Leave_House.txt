I can see she's in for this
She can't see her
It can make her happy
And I can see

She's says she's gone forward
And she's crying
And see she's calling

Leave house
Leave house
Leave house
(And it's the first thing that I would do)
(And I'd make sure he'll follow you)
Leave house

They say that I'm lonely
That I hide away
That I hide away from all of you
And I can't see

She's says she doesn't follow
She need an answer
And see she's falling

Leave house
Leave house
Leave house
(And it's the first thing that I would do)
(And I'd make sure he'll follow you)
Leave house

Leave house
Leave house
Leave house
(And don't tell me what I should do)
(And I'd make sure he'll follow you)
Leave house

And she can call my number
The way she feels like home
And I'll come and catch her
When she feels she's gone

And yeah we're both alone now
And yet we're not forever
The thing that makes us lonely
Will bring us back together

Leave house
Leave house
Leave house
(And that's the last thing that I would do)
(And I'd make sure he'll follow you)
Leave house
