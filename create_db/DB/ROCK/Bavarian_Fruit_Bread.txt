Saw you
On the high street
A little bit out of love for me

Oh well, you'll always be
I've got a brand new machine
I'm gonna make myself treat you mean
I'm gonna spend all of my money
Making you cry

I forgot
I thought freely
You're the one that is untrusty

I've got a brand new set of wings
I'm gonna drive you straight to tears
I'm gonna spend all of my money
Making you cry
