I have to leave my heart
And go away
To a land across the farest sea
But my thoughts
Will always be by you
If I should never come
Don't cry in vain

Aloha-oe - Aloha-oe
Be back again some day
And then I'll stay
Your warm embrace
Will leave a trace
Until we meet again

Through seven seas and hills
I'm outward bound
But one thing I know
My heart is found
When the wind blows
Tahiti girl,beware
It could be that I'm homeward bound

Aloha-oe - Aloha-oe,...
