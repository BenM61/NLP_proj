Major Lazer

As I walk through the water, so many things I see (uh huh)
And then I say to myself, "it's never as it seems
'Cause I am the one, I rule my world
Nobody rule my destiny
'Cause you are the one, you rule your world
No bad man own your destiny

Leave me alone, let me live my life
Leave me alone, let me live it up, live it up
Leave me alone, I could live my life
Leave me alone, I could live it up, live it up
Leave me alone, let me

Are we losin' control, or is it meant to be? (uh huh)
Now I've opened my mind now
Come on, set me free
'Cause I am the one, I rule my world
Nobody rule my destiny
'Cause you are the one, you rule your world
No bad man own your destiny

Leave me alone, let me live my life
Leave me alone, let me live it up, live it up
Leave me alone, I could live my life
Leave me alone, I could live it up, live it up
Leave me alone, let me live my life
Leave me alone, let me live it up, live it up
Leave me alone, I could live my life
Leave me alone, I could live it up, live it up
Leave me alone, let me

Why won't you leave me alone?
