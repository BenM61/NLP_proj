Old machinery's broken down 
There's no new past there's no new sound 
What would you do if they crumbled to the ground 
Wake up you must be dreaming 

Changes in our lives 
We'll make it in the end 
Machinery's broken in two 
What are we to do? 

Where were you when the day caved in 
It seems the streets were the place to be 
Something quite disturbing filled the air 
Wake up you must be dreaming (what an uneasy feeling) 

Machine fell down and smashed the ground 
People cried for miles around 
Well that's what someone said 
Wake up you must be dreaming (a quite uneasy feeling) 

What are we to do?
