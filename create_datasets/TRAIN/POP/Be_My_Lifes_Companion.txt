Want no silver threads among the go-o-old
Want no silver threads among the go-o-old
Want no silver threads, want some action instead
Want no silver threads among the go-o-old

Be my life's companion and you'll never grow old
I'll love you so much that you'll never grow old
When there's joy in living you just never grow old
You've got to stay young 'cause you'll never grow old

People who are lonely can be old at thirty-three
Don't let it happen to you, and don't let it happen to me

Be my life's companion and you'll never grow old
You'll never grow old, no, you'll never grow old
Love and youth and ha-appiness are yours to have and hold
Be my life's companion and you'll never grow old

I-I-I know a man who's lonely and he's old at thirty-
three
No one wants to be - old at thirty-three
Your-our-our disposition sours like a lemon on a tree
Don't let it happen to you and don't let it happen to me

Be my life's companion and you'll never grow old
Yes I'll love you so much that you'll never grow old
Love and youth and ha-appiness are yours to have and hold
Be my life's companion, be my life's companion
And you'll never grow old
