When you told your secret name
I burst in flame and burned
I'm floating
Love has set our hearts aflame
Burn like the sun
We're floating as one...

Floating
Floating
Floating with you.

Ever since you kissed my eyes
I find myself alive
I'm floating
Ever since I held your face
I soar through space,
I'm floating with you...

Floating
Floating
Floating with you.

(spoken)
Why don't you come over to my house? 
Please...

Love has set our hearts aflame
Burn like the sun
We're floating as one...

Floating
Floating
Floating with you.
