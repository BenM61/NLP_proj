[Busta Rhymes]
You don't know what we doing right here!

[Chorus 1: x2]
One two three we gon' turn it out
And make you rock to the beat and then scream and shout
We gonna hit you with the shit we got here
We gonna blow your mind (blow your mind)
Keep it moving like this, keep it moving like that
If I die, I'ma only come back
Yo, I'm saying if you think that you can step to me wrong
Don't even waste your time(waste your time)

[Chorus 2]
You niggas talk shit then abandon ship
Niggas talk shit then they abandon ship
Niggas talk shit, then they abandon ship
Niggas talk shit then they abandon ship

[Rampage the Last Boy Scout & Busta Rhymes]
I 8Off like the Assassin, now I'm blastin I'm takin over
Stick you for your blue Range Rover
I told ya, Rampage a real live soldier
Been in the game, sinc the age of thirteen
A microphone fiend, so I'm goin to see my P.O.
It's August the 1st, so I guess I'm a Leo
My P.O., look like Vanessa Del Rio
She pulled my rap sheet, just like, Neo Geo

Hahahaaa!  I always roam through the forest
Just like a brontosaurus, born in the month of May
So my sign is Taurus, kick you in your face
Like my fuckin name was Chuck Norris, make you sing my chorus
Rock to the beat and then, turn into a walrus
You remain nameless, my victory remains flawless
Acting like you wild, but I know you really harmless
While your time is coming, I make the fat shit regardless

Many niggas want to know when the Ramp return
Yo I'm getting phone calls from that nigga Howard Stern
He wants to know about my Flip Mode click
The way we get down and BUST niggas shit!
LP after LP, we make G's
I run up in your ganks den take you for your keys
I'm not lying or joking, you get broken
Dead in Flatbush, back to Roanoake and

People always asking me, how your shit be selling
For making shit guaranteed to bust your fucking melon
Police throwed me up on charges like I was a felon
There was no telling, when I was striking had you swelling
Cruising in my Lands, watch the police how they be gelling
Lock you up for days and got a nigga ass smelling
Yo f*ck that!  You best believe there ain't no time for dwelling
If you ain't makin noise you need to kill the fucking yelling

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Rampage & Busta]
Yo, yo, yo I run up in your set like a New York city
I can't slip, I beat you down with my vice grip
Your lost, that means you way off course
No remorse, I'm gettin five in The Source

I be saddle back biting motherfuckers like a horse
Turn and toss, niggas all up in my applesauce
Watch me reinforce, my shit feel good like intercourse
Ever since I was a shorty rockin Hugo Boss

Hey yo bust it Bust (why) you just made my day
If you didn't put me on I'd be locked like O.J.
Now I'm writing rhymes hitting shorties everyday
In the full running drinking ice Tanqueray
I don't eat pork I take a fish fillet
Now I'm knocking out niggas from, to, touche!
Now I'm going back around the way
I'm ripping shit, like my name was Marvin Gaye

Yo, now I'm back with more Bionic like my name was Colt Seavers
Got you niggas open like a bunch of wide receivers
Time is on the meter, go clean your act up in the cleaners
Chicken head, give me some of your chicken fajitas
Yo I beg your pardon, I write my rhymes way past the margins
Squeeze the Charmin, peace to one million men marchin
When you talk shit you really don't know what you startin
Now your shit is done like a fuckin empty milk carton

It's on for the nine-six, mad shows at the Ritz
Now we got you open like Fixx
Sticking to your stomach like Quaker Oat Grits
Fisherman hat with my brand new kicks
On the low, I still rock my Girbauds
See the show, I got my nickel plated fo'-fo'
All my rough niggas open the do'
Cause Boy Scout brings the ruckus and I'm still hardco'

Yo, when I walk streets you know my blade's a little sharper
F*ck Peter Parker, I cross you like a magic marker
Every time I hit I always hit a little harder
Blazing to the point where niggas look a little darker
Catching suntans from my music, fans understand
Making fat shit, I always love to lend a helping hand
Organized rhyme unit like the Poison Clan
While your ride is busted, I be your luxury Sedan
Number one nigga in the chain of command
Breaking fool in school like my nigga Geechie Dan
Hey yo, I see intruders on my scan
Singing at your funeral like Bobby Bluebland

[Chorus 1]
