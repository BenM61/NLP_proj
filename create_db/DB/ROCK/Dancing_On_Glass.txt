Science and reason will tell us so
The blood in our veins are just chemicals
Better believe I keep my demons to myself
Better believe it's getting harder
But I'm never gonna stop until it's broken
Never gonna stop until it's broken

How long 'til we learn
Dancing is dangerous
How long 'til we find
The devil inside of us
How high is too low
We're not that young
So we're never gonna stop never gonna stop never gonna stop
Until we break it

Dancing on glass
Dancing on glass

We all have our secrets our secrets know
Our violence mistaken for silence, oh
Better believe I keep my reasons to myself
Better believe it's never been easier
And never gonna stop until it's broken
Never gonna stop until it's broken

How long 'til we learn
Dancing is dangerous
How long 'til we find
The devil inside of us
How high is too low
We're not that young
So we're never gonna stop never gonna stop never gonna stop
Until we break it
