I pray that my love is home for Christmas 
And reigns her presence near that Christmas tree
She's been away since last Christmas, Christmas day
I am so lonely and stay this way

I pray that my love is home for Christmas 
Oh my, what a Christmas that would be 

I pray that my love is home for Christmas 
And brings her presence near that Christmas tree
She's been away since last Christmas, Christmas day
I am so lonely and stay this way

I pray that my love is home for Christmas 
Oh my, what a Christmas that would be
