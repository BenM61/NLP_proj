Hello, hello, hello
is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me.
Is there anybody home?

Come on now, I hear you're feelin' down
Well, I can ease your pain
and get you on your feet again.

Relax. I need some information first.
Relax. Just to face the facts.
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain you are receeding.
A distant ship floats on the horizon.
You're only comin' through in waves.
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying.
When I was a child I caught a fever.
My hands felt like two balloons.
Now I've got that feeling once again,
I can't explain; you would not understand.
This is now who I am.
I, I, I've become comfortably numb.

OK. It's just a little pinprick.
There'll be no more high, but you may feel a little sick.
Can you stand up now?
I do believe it's working. Uh huh, Uh huh.

Gotta keep it goin' through the show;
come on, it's time to go.
Gotta keep it goin' through the show;
come on, it's time to go.
Gotta keep it goin' through the show;
come on, it's time to go.
Gotta keep it goin' through the show;
come on, it's time to go.
There is no pain you are receeding.
A distant ship floats on the horizon.
You're only comin' through in waves.
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying.
When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse
out of the corner of my eye.
I turned to look but it was gone.
I could not put my finger on it.
The child is grown; the dream is gone.
I, I, I've become comfortably numb.
I, I, I've become comfortably numb.

Uh huh
I, I, I've become comfortably numb.
