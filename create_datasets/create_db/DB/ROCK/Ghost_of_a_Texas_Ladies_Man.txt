I saw a face in the shower door
Cowboy smile
Came and faded

I reached for my towel on the floor
I didn't think it was exactly where I'd laid it
You don't scare me, you don't scare me, I said
To whatever it was floating in the air about my bed
He knew I understand
He was the ghost of a Texas ladies' man.

I reached to turn out the light
He wouldn't let me get near it
He seemed so glad to see a woman in the flesh

And I really liked his spirit
You don't scare me you don't scare me I cried
To my ectoplasmic lover from the other side
He knew I understand
He was the ghost of a Texas ladies' man
