I want to be a lilikoi, Boy Lilikoi
You grind your claws, you howl, you growl unafraid of Hoi Polloi
You run, you're free, you climb endless trees, you reignite
You growl, you howl, you show your teeth
You bite, it's alright

Just say no more, use your eyes, the world goes and flutters by
Use your eyes, you'll know you are
Use your eyes, the world goes and flutters by
Use your eyes, you'll know you are

Wild be my boy, you burn so bright, till you illuminate
One day you're out, you give up the fight, you slow down heart-rate

We all grow old, use your life, the world goes and flutters by
Use your life, you'll know you are
Use your life, the world goes and flutters by
Use your life, you'll know you are

Electricity wires are down, rainbow colours fade into brown
I dreamt your smile was shifting for good
Courageous boy, now you are gone
And run faster, yet have no place to go
Your spirit still burns, it's now a ghost sun
You are (Alive)
You are (Alive)

I want to be a lilikoi, boy, you 
You grind your claws, you howl, you growl, unafraid of Hoi Polloi

Electricity wires are down, rainbow colors fade into brown
I dreamt your smile was shifting for good
Courageous boy, now you are gone
You run faster, yet have no place to go
Your spirit still burns, it's now a ghost sun
You are (Alive)
You are (Alive)
