Wait a minute 
Before you walk away 
Let me finish 
I've got a lot to say, yeah
Baby I'm not gonna tolerate 
This game that you play, no 
You'll regret it 
If you desert me this way, yeah
When there's nobody 
To dry your eyes 
Suddenly you're gonna realize 

Don't you know 
You need me 
Don't you see 
Believe me 
Before you act so hastily 
Baby remember you need me 

Honey listen don't make a big mistake 
I'm in your system 
You really can't escape 
No, no
When there's nobody 
To hold your hand 
Suddenly you're gonna understand 

Don't you know, yeah
You need me 
Don't you see, uh huh
Believe me 
Before you act so hastily 
Baby remember you need me 

Don't you know, hey 
You need me 
Don't you see 
Believe me 
Before you act so hastily 
Baby remember you need me 

No one understands you like I do 
After everything 
That we've been through 
Baby, you can turn around and leave 
But I know that you'll keep 
Coming right back to me (back to me)

Yeah
Woah
Don't you know 
You need me 
Don't you see 
Believe me 
Before you act so hastily 
Baby remember you need me 

Don't you know 
You need me, you need me, you need me
Don't you see 
Believe me, baby now
Before you act so hastily 
Baby remember you need me 
Don't you know
You need me
Don't you see
Believe me (yeah, yeah yeah)
