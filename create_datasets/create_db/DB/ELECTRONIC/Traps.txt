Was a ghost, I was adored by you
I trapped an owl, I shot a hare for you
Can I ignite? Can I burn like never before?
What you desire it's inside of me I am sure

My intentions were good, my intentions were good
I am the garden, I am the sea, will you lay a trap for me?
I am the garden, I am the sea, will you lay a trap for me?
I gave you words, I planted trees by your bed
You said you loved me, you said you'd have me instead.
Can I ignite? Can I burn like never before?

What you desire it's inside of me that I'm sure
My intentions were good. My intentions were good
You hold me down and nightly we tear ourselves apart
You hold me down, I know things, do you from the start?
I am the garden, I am the sea, will you lay a trap for me?
I am the garden, I am the sea, will you lay a trap for me?
Oh whoa oh
The sound of fear
Oh whoa oh
The sound of fear
Don't let the story down oh
Don't let the story down oh
Don't let the story down oh
