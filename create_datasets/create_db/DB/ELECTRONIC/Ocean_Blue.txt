Well you took me home 
And you took me back 
But deep down inside 
The feeling just died and I 
Couldn't see why 

From indigo to royal blue 
I travel far but no one will do 
Anytime, anyplace 
Every shape every face 
Brings memories of you 

Blue to be blue 
To be blue 
Ocean blue 
Blue to be blue 
To be blue 
Ocean blue - ocean blue 

Fair weather friends might drift away 
When summer ends and skies burn grey 
So I walk to the ocean 
Pilot these shores 
Just thinking of you 

It's time we kissed the clouds goodbye 
From now on it's strictly blue sky 
Come rain and shine 
The outlook is still fine 
I'm thinking of you 

Blue to be blue 
To be blue 
Ocean blue 
Blue to be blue 
To be blue 

Ocean blue - ocean blue 
Blue to be blue 
To be blue 
Ocean blue, ocean blue 
Ocean blue, ocean blue 

Ocean blue, ocean blue 
Ocean blue, ocean ocean 
Ocean, ocean 

Blue to be blue 
To be blue 
Ocean blue 
Blue to be blue 
To be blue 
Ocean blue - ocean blue 

I stand at the head of the queue 
There's mutiny's every crew 
Wishin' and wonderin' 'bout you 
Ocean blue
