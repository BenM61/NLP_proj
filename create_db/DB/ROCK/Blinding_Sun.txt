We fell asleep on the riverbank one sunny afternoon
We fell asleep on the riverbank one sunny afternoon
Woke with a rope around my neck, swear I did no wrong
Blinding sun, beats down in my eyes
Blinding sun, beats down in my eyes
Had my fill on the river bank, with you by my side

What have I done?
What have I done?

Can't be long to the setting of the sun
No, it can't be long now to the setting of the sun
Maybe then I'll see, maybe then I'll fight or run
Who are you, and what do you want?
Who are you, and what do you want?
Your countenance shines brighter than the midday sun

What have I done?
What have I done?
What have I done?

Just my luck if nightfall never comes
Be just my luck if nightfall never comes
Waiting with a rope around my neck for the setting of the sun
Sun, sun, why don't you set?
Said, sun, sun, why don't you set?
Try to put this all behind me, but I can't forget

What have I done?
What have I done?
What have I done?
What have I done?
Where have you gone?
What have I done?
What have I done?
