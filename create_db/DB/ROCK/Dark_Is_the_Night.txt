It's time we said goodbye, time now to decide
Oh, don't you feel so small? Dark is the night for all

It's time we moved out west, this time will be the best
And when the evenings fall, dark is the night for all

It's time, yeah to break free, it's time to pull away
For you and for me, it's time, yeah to break free
We need to celebrate the mystery

It's time we said goodbye, time for you and I
Oh, don't you feel so small? Dark is the night for all
