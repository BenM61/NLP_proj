Representin fo' those holdin 25 screws in they deck

I jumps up early and I yawns and stretch 
Anotha day another dolla, 'nother case to get
I take my time and realize that this game is real
I got my mind on firearms, but I'm swanging barbe grill
Gots to act real bad when I close red doors
I'm shootin spidas off my rims 'cause I'm ridin on fours
And niggaz don't understand that we be drinkin the norm
Never trust broads they're frauds
On the 'vard is where I sling when I claim my name
Back in the game Hershallwood, Texas regained
It's the nine-eight and I'm jumpin in the mix 
Rocks up on my wrists and got haters on my list 
How ya like me now cause I'm real
Comin down piece and chain four shiny grills
Gots to bring havack where them boys at
Fixin to break the mic now is that Fat Pat?

25 lighters on my dressa yessir, I gots to get paid
We got 25 lighters on the dresser yessir gots to get paid
25 lighters on my dressa yessir, I gots to get paid
We got 25 lighters on the dresser yessir gots to get paid

I'm so throwed in the game
Southside Playas, Skrewed Up click mayne
Wit the finest set you can bet them smoove ass event
Comin through this motherfucker man, hold up and set
Some niggaz catch me high like dat 
And some niggaz act like they want to pull a gat
But they betta watch out for the boy PAT
That's them motherfuckin haters can they handle me
Cause I be so throwed in this game
Comin down on the swing
Grip wood grain on the shirt I leave a stain 
Cause you try to jack a real true G
Comin down the boulevard 
Can they see me swangin swangin swang till we live
Pop my trunk and give give give
Niggaz betta see a nigga roll
Starched down and I'm rollin on eighty fours
If the nigga FAT represent the click 
Right up in the bowl and a whole lotta shit
Betta look around cause they don't understand it
I'ma say, "Hold up!" and scream, "God dammit!"
Cause I'ma let the cat gone grip and gone take a trip
And it's the empty clip just throw it off the ship 
Cause it's a throwaway gat
It's that Fat Pat, where them haters at where them haterss at 
Man love it man
