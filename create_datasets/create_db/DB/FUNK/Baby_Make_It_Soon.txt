If you're coming home, like your letters say

And the place you're staying now, ain't too far away

Can you write tonight, just to let me know

'cause since you've been away girl, I've missed you so

You won't let me down, 'cause I'm sure you're homeward bound

And you'll be back safe and sound, 'cause I just know

Baby make it soon, make it soon (I can't wait another day)

Baby make it soon, make it soon (Lord I know I need you, come on)

Baby make it soon, make it soon (I need you right away)

Baby make it soon, make it soon (Lord I've gotta see you)

Right back here, here in my arms

If you're coming home like you promised to 
Will you write tonight and tell me what you're gonna do 
For I'm lonely now and I'm gonna stay that way 
Till I hold you so tightly in my arms again

You won't let me down, 'cause I'm sure you're homeward bound 
And you'll be back safe and sound, 'cause I just know

Baby make it soon, make it soon (I can't wait another day) 
Baby make it soon, make it soon (Lord I know I need you, come on) 
Baby make it soon, make it soon (I need you right away) 
Baby make it soon, make it soon (Lord I've gotta see you) 
Right back here, here in my arms

You won't let me down, 'cause I'm sure you're homeward bound 
And you'll be back safe and sound, 'cause I just know - Whoa -oh

Baby make it soon, make it soon (I can't wait another day) 
Baby make it soon, make it soon (Lord I know I need you, come on) 
Baby make it soon, make it soon (I need you right away) 
Baby make it soon, make it soon (Lord I've gotta see you) 
Come back baby 
Baby make it soon, make it soon (Lord I've gotta see you) 
Come on baby 
Baby make it soon, make it soon (I've gotta see you) 
Baby make it soon, make it soon (Lord I know I need you) 
Come on baby 
Baby make it soon' make it soon (Lord I've gotta see you)
