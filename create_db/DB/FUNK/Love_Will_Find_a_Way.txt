If love wants to travel to your heart
Love will find a way

I tell you, no, no mountain is too high
And no peak too high to climb
And no, no place is too remote
For true love to find

I know no, no river is too wide
No matter what people say
Lord, if love wants to travel to your heart
Love will find a way

Oh, the mountains, oh the valleys
Oh, the streams, love would climb
Seeking a place in your heart
If there are two people love wants to combine
Nothing can keep them apart

I know that no, no river is too wide
No matter what people say
No matter what they say
If love wants to travel to your heart
Love will find a way

I know that if love wants to travel to your heart
Love will find a way
