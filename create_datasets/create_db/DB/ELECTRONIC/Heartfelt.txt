You told me you loved me
But it never really felt that way
Just another game you played
It always seemed to make me stay

You said you adored me
But you never looked me in the eyes
But you called me all alone one night
Tossed me roses and turned out the lights

Do you have a heart?
You seemed so artificial
It tears me apart
The way you say that word to me

You know you're no work of art
Still you managed to get to me
But don't even start
To tell me things that you don't mean

Love
Love is just a word
A used up term
Unless it's heartfelt

Love
Love is just a noun
An empty sound
Unless it's heartfelt

Why don't you just hold me
Or would you prefer a smaller thing?
But at least your kisses do not sting
As much as all the words that you don't mean

Maybe you should just leave me
I've shed so many tears for you
I've wasted all these years on you
I was always so sincere with you

Do you have a heart?
You seemed so artificial
It tears me apart
The way you say that word to me

You know you're no work of art
Still you managed to get to me
But don't even start
To tell me things that you don't mean

Love
Love is just a word
A used up term
Unless it's heartfelt

Love
Love is just a noun
An empty sound
Unless it's heartfelt

Love
Love is still around
It can be found
It can be heartfelt

Love
Love is more than a word
When its meant to be heard
Love can make you heartfelt
