As I wake 
In the darkness 
And I look around 
There is no sound
It's so tranquil
It's so calm like you
But now I hear a noise
Is there any way to out of this nightmare?
Baby, I'm alone now
And you're laughing at me
But I take life
In a way that you could never see
So if you're leaving
You better let me know
'Cause I've already started my plan
And I'm never gonna let you go
I've lived on the dark side of the moon
And I've been to the heart of the sun
I've had my time with many ladies
And I've killed many men
Before my sixteenth year was done
So you be forewarned
I'm coming after you
About the time I catch up to you
I'll never
No I'll never
I'll never let you go, no
Some people think I'm an advocate of Lucifer
And some say I'm a child of god, yes they do
Some people think I've got the nine lives of a cat
And others say I'm filthy as a dog
So you be forewarned
I'm coming after you
About the time I catch up to you
I'll never
No I'll never
I'll never let you go, alright
So you be forewarned
I'm coming after you
About the time I catch up to you
I'll never
No I'll never
I'll never let you go, alright
