If you were handed seven wishes
Would you turn your back for more?
Would you hold on tight to what you have?
Would you try to change the score?

If you were given back a lifetime?
Would you find some room for me?
Oh, won't you take my hand and walk away
Know it all was meant to be?

Heart achin'
Heart breakin'
Hearts changing
Never want the same thing

Rise to the sun with seven wishes
Will you turn into stone with seven wishes?
And your eyes on the run with seven wishes
Seven wishes

If we could travel back in time now
When I handed you the key?
Oh I know you learned your magic well
Would you use the magic on me?

Are the changes for the better?
Do the lonely ones agree?
I see you handing out the promises
That were meant for only me

Heart achin'
Heart breakin'
Hearts changing
Never want the same thing

Rise to the sun with seven wishes
Will you turn into stone with seven wishes?
And your eyes on the run with seven wishes
Seven wishes

Heart achin'
Heart breakin'
Hearts changing
Never want the same thing

Heart achin'
Heart breakin'
Hearts changing
Never want the same thing

Rise to the sun with seven wishes
Will you turn into stone with seven wishes?
And your eyes on the run with seven wishes
Seven wishes
