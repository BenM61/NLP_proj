My baby's gone and I don't know why 
She let out this morning 
Like a rusty shot in a hollow sky 
She left me without warning 
Sooner than the dogs could bark 
And faster than the sun rose 
Down to the banks in an old mule car 
She took a flatboat across the shallow 

Left me in my tears to drown 
She left a baby daughter 
Now the river's wide and deep and brown 
She's crossing muddy waters 

Tobacco standing in the fields 
Be rotten come November 
And a bitter heart will not reveal 
A spring that love remembers 
When that sweet brown girl of mine 
Her black eyes are ravens 
We broke the bread and drank the wine 
From a jug that she'd been saving 

Left me in my tears to drown 
She left a baby daughter 
Now the river's wide and deep and brown 
She's crossing muddy waters 

Baby's crying and the daylight's gone 
That big oak tree is groaning 
In a rush of wind and river of song 
I can hear my true love moaning 
Crying for her baby child 
Or crying for her husband 
Crying for that river's wild 
To take her from her loved ones

Left me in my tears to drown 
She left a baby daughter 
Now the river's wide and deep and brown 
And she's crossing muddy waters 

Now the river's wide and deep and brown 
And she's crossing muddy waters
