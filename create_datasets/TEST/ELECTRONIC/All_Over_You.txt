The sap is rising
And there's no disguising
What I feel for you
So mesmerizing
Got me fantasizing
Nothing I won't do
Parascending, whoa oh
But it's all depending
On your sky so blue
My wings keep stalling
From the sky I'm falling
And it's over - all over you
All over you
Let me build a nation
That bears no relation to the one we knew
Take inspiration
From my own salvation
'Cause it's over - all over you
Get on board the gravy train
Off the rails if you don't keep me sane
Justify the things I do
Just believe that it's all over you
All over you
The sap is rising
And there's no disguising
What I feel for you
So mesmerizing
Got me fantasizing
And it's over - all over you
(Spoken)
Through the heat-haze and the blue
I will shimmer and distort
And become what you always knew
But were never taught in this sad time
Take on board the things I say
Just be sure that you'll be mine someday
Justify the things I do
Just believe that it's all over you
All over you
The sap is rising
Got me fantasizing
So mesmerizing
And there's no disguising
That it's over - all over you
