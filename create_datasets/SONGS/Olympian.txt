Give me something I can hold 
With that something I will grow

Make me crazy with your arms 
It's all gone hazy, 
It's all gone wrong Olympian, framed by God 
So bring me water to cool off 
Formidable and not afraid Of the next world, just delayed

How can you decline such grand designs? 
I'm flattered that you thought 
I make a good reward, but 
How can you survive my blatant lies? 
I'm flattered that you thought 
So come taste my good reward

I wanted to be there with you 
For I can only be normal with you 
I'm taking your life for you
