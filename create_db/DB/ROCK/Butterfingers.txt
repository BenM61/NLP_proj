Butterfingers-butterfingers-butterfingers-butterfingers
Doo-wop, doo-wop, doo-wop
Well butterfingers-butterfingers

That's what everybody calls me, since I lost you
Well a-butterfingers-butterfingers
Had you but I couldn't hold you, you just slipped through
Now I don't know what to do

Well a-butterfingers-butterfingers
That's the only name for me for lettin' you go
Well a-butterfingers-butterfingers
Never did I realize that I loved you so

It's all my fault dear, I know
Well I took your love for granted, I gave a little in return
And now that I'm without you, I'm gonna learn how tears can burn
Well butterfingers-butterfingers

That's what everybody calls me, since I lost you
Well a-butterfingers-butterfingers
Had you but I couldn't hold you, you just slipped through
Come back because I love you
