They call me crazy
I'll be the one if you believe it
Give all of my heart if you will keep it
But you better keep it right

You got me under your skin
And I feel ya deep from within
You better follow tonight, alright?

Tonight we're gonna light, light, light it up
Tonight we're gonna light, light, light it up
I wanna see the light
We're burning in the sky
Tonight we're gonna light, light, light it up
L-L-ight it up

Bun up inna dis, get burn up inna dis
Hot like a scorching sun up inna dis

Good energy is what we living for
We ah turn up, turn up, turn ah turn turn ah turn up to turn it up
When we see the lighters, dem ah flash up, flash up
And the sparks dem a burn it up

Tonight we're gonna light, light, light it up

Fire blazing through the roof
