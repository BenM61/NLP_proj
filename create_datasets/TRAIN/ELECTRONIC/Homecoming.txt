Walking into light
From the blank evening sky
Knuckles rub away the darkness
Circling my eyes
Walking into warmth
From the cold evening air
Numb white fingers push
Greasy rain through my hair
You walk into view
From shadow thrown against the door
Hands reach out and grasp the moment
They've been waiting for
You pull me close
Dampness seeps
through to your skin
You peel the layers away
I feel the fire ignite within
 You create the feeling
 I contain the need
 It's moments that we're stealing
 No pleasure's ever free
 You sustain the rhythm
 I'll maintain the beat
 It's the only ,chance we're given
 Let's turn this cold to heat
 You possess the notion
 I take full heed
 We're bound by this emotion
 Two bodies - one heartbeat
 You create the feeling
 I contain the need
 You sustain the rhythm
 I'll maintain the beat
Desire comes alive
Nothing interrupts the flow
Water nurtures every crevice
Where this love needs to grow
Sliding to the floor
We swell , falling to the ground
The world becomes a place
With no clear shapes, with no clear sounds
We're lost for a short while
In the knot where love's entwined
You pour the freedom from deep inside
I drink it back like wine
The murmur of your voice
Soft words soothe away the doubt
your strength - so essential
Something i can't do without
 You ...
Inside we slow each movement
'Til we're static once again
Outside the city runs
Cars through roads like blood through veins
Here sweet sticky air
Locke a cover keeps us warm
Drops of love fall from us
The last moments of the storm
Opening my eyes
You're even closer now to me
As the crowd goes pushing onwards
Crashing forwards like a sea
We turn and feel the world
Right now a million miles away
It's always there to interfere
But I'm always here to say
 You ...
