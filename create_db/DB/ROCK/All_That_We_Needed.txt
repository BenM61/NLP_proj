Two wrongs don't make a right, but I don't care tonight.
Maybe we're all that we needed.

Oh no, don't let me go for this, don't let me go for this.

I might be a fool, you might be one too.
Maybe we're all that we needed.
Two wrongs don't make a right, but I don't care tonight.
Maybe we're all that we needed.

Maybe were more than the light ever seen.
Maybe were not meant to not disagree.
Maybe were crazy baby.

Two wrongs don't make a right but I don't care tonight. (Maybe were all that we needed.)
