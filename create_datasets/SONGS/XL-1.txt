You talked about the weather
What could I say
We're never seen together
We hide away

Didn't know what dreams were for
Didn't know what friends were for
Didn't know what love was for
You still don't know now

You had a secret passion
I had one too
You tend to follow fashion
Do what I do

Didn't know what dreams were for
Didn't know what friends were for
Didn't know what love was for
You still don't know now

You talked about the weather

Didn't know what dreams were for
Didn't know what friends were for
Didn't know what love was for

Didn't know what dreams were for
