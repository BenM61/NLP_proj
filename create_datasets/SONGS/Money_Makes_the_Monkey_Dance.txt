Eh marara I lle llea
You are about to embark on a journey
You are going to visit monkeys, dolphins
And people

I look around and all I see are politicians on the take
I look at me, I am the same but I don't notice
And I have learned that everybody
Has a price tag on his head

Though it's money that will make the monkey dance
Yes, it's money that will make the monkey dance
And it's money that will make the monkey dance
Yes, it's money that will make the monkey, monkey
Monkey dance

On Sunday mornings when I went went to church
A buck was always made
A true parade to pave the way into the glory
And 30 coins was all they paid for
All the ways I should behave

Though it's money that will make the monkey dance
Yes, it's money that will make the monkey dance
And it's money that will make the monkey dance
Yes, it's money that will make the monkey dance

Aye, awa ko ako

And I have paid my way through life
I've kept myself so far removed
From everyone and everything that could be purchased
I will collect what I've put in my piggy bank is locked within

Though it's money that will make the monkey dance
Yes, it's money that will make the monkey dance
And it's money that will make the monkey dance
Oh, I want money give me money, so much money
Tender money

'Cause it's money that will make the monkey dance
I'm the monkey, I'm the monkey
Eh marara I

And though my pockets have a hole
I feel content within my soul
I've been sincere with all the customers encountered
I can't complain, I'm rich in love
And I must thank my God above

Though it's money that will make the monkey dance
Yes, it's money that will make the monkey dance
And it's money that will make the monkey dance
Yes, it's money that will make the monkey dance
