Your words are high and running through a tired mind
A howling wind surrounds you
I'm trying to illuminate a clouded heart
I'm gonna find the strength to stay

Feel we gonna break out
At the last step now
Feel we gonna break out
I really wanna see your face, and I see

Bright, bright lights, bright lights to guide me
Bright, bright lights, bright lights to guide me home
Bright, bright lights, bright lights to guide me
Bright, bright lights, bright lights to guide me home

Your hands are high and floating through a darkened sky
So many eyes around you
The distant sounds as neon sparks light up my heart
I wanna find a brighter day

Feel we gonna break out
I really wanna see your face, and I see

Bright, bright lights, bright lights to guide me
Bright, bright lights, bright lights to guide me home
Bright, bright lights, bright lights to guide me
Bright, bright lights, bright lights to guide me home

You shut your heart and shut my door
You shut your heart
When I said, "hold me," when I said, "hold me," when I see

Bright, bright lights, bright lights to guide me
Bright, bright lights, bright lights to guide me home
Bright, bright lights, bright lights to guide me
Bright, bright lights, bright lights to guide me home

Bright lights to guide me
Bright lights to guide me
Bright lights to guide me
Bright lights to guide me home
