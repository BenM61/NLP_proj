There are no guarantees in life
Not for the present, nor for the future
All I know is that I'm here
Don't know for how long

I love the way you live so intensely
Enjoy every minute of life
With space to swing
Your arms around laughing loudly

Unlike me, unlike me
Do you think I'm strange?
Unlike you, unlike you
I am not pretending

There is no time
There is no time
There is no time
Time doesn't really exist

The past, the present and the future
Are all side by side, hand in hand
You move and change, yet you go nowhere
Everything stays the same

You stare at me and ask me questions
Makes me nervous
This room, it keeps a constant tone
While I'm on a roller coaster

Unlike me, unlike me
Do you think I'm strange?
Unlike you, unlike you
I am not pretending

There is no time
There is no time
There is no time
Time doesn't really exist

There is no time
There is no time
There is no time
Time doesn't really exist
