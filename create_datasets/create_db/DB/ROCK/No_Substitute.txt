I want you but you never reply
I can't get through on your line
While your intuition
Keeps holding you down
You're hangin' me up every time

I want you to want me
And whisper my name
In every breath that you take
I want to touch you
And fill up your dreams
And vow your heart will never break

I want your passion
Though it's not your fashion
I know you can make it your style

Don't you know there's no...
Substitute, I live for your touch
Substitute, I want you so much
Substitute, no substitute for your love

Open your window and see the real world
To know what you've been missing
Come out of the shadows
Insecurity lies in a heart
Afraid to listen
Don't gamble your life away
On things that will fade away
Love is waiting for you

Don't you know there's no...
Substitute, I live for your touch
Substitute, I want you so much
Substitute, no substitute for your love

I want your passion
Though it's not your fashion
I know you can make it your style

Don't you know there's no...
Substitute, I live for your touch
Substitute, I want you so much
Substitute, no substitute for your love
