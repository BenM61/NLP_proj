It's beautiful, and even though
I told you so, you know
We'd face survival, we're leaving lights on
We'll move or go on somehow

Looking like soldiers waiting to drown
And I'm not around no more
And looking at people that don't make a sound
When music's around, stay warm

And we've got no rhyme or no reason now
We've got the time of our lives now

It's seasonal, nobody knows
We'll make it known somehow
Just you and me, and we can see
Small machines and sunrise

Looking like soldiers waiting to drown
And I'm not around no more
Pictures of people that don't make a sound
When music's around, stay warm

And we've got no rhyme and no reason now
We've got the time of our lives now

Pictures of people that don't make a sound
When music's around, stay warm
And we've got no rhyme and no reason now

Looking like soldiers waiting to drown
And I'm not around no more
Lookin at people that don't make a sound
When music's around, stay warm

And we've got no rhyme and no reason now
We've got the time of our lives now
