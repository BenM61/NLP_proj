Break it on down
Bless you

Where are you going
My beautiful friend
Is this the road that
You take till the end
And if we left behind
Is this the highway
Of our mankind

Axes spins so round and round we go
Where we're goin' no one really knows
Here we here we here we here we go
Feel the fire
Way down below

Come on dim the lights
It's party time
Switch on the strobe
Do what you like
Gonna have a ball tonight
Let's have a ball
Down at the Globe

Come on dim the lights
Switch on the strobe
We're gonna have a ball tonight
Down at the Globe

Get up and clean your teeth and have a shave
It's 1 a. m. let's go out to a rave
One more and before we hit that grave
It's harder than a microwave wave

Come on dim the lights
It's party time
Switch on the strobe
Do what you like
Gonna have a ball tonight
Let's have a ball
Down at the Globe

Come on dim the lights
It's party time
Switch on the strobe
Do what you like
We're gonna have a ball tonight
Let's have a ball
Down at the Globe

Where's the party officer?

Come on dim the lights
It's party time
Switch on the strobe
Do what you like
We're gonna have a ball tonight
Let's have a ball
Down at the Globe

Here we go party time break it all down

Where is the failure
Not in this land
But still you try to
Get what you can
You know that it's bad but
If you insist
Here's one more chance now
That you just missed

Come on dim the lights
It's party time
Switch on the strobe
Do what you like
We're gonna have a ball tonight
Let's have a ball
Down at the Globe

I believe you

Come on dim the lights
It's party time
Switch on the strobe
Do what you like
We're gonna have a ball tonight
Let's have a ball
Down at the Globe

Waking up the global warning way
Nepal cornflakes for my special kay
What's the halth departement got to say
Don't smoke more than 50 fags a day

Come on dim the lights
It's party time
Switch on the strobe
Do what you like
We're gonna have a ball tonight
Let's have a ball
Down at the Globe

Come on party on down

Come on dim the lights

Switch on the strobe
