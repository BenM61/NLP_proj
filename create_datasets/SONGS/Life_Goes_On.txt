So you left me, I'll never know
I hate to tell our friends wherever I go
I played a losing game
But life goes on just the same

I was happy right from the start
But now I'm so lonely
Since you broke my heart
I played a losing game
Life goes on just the same
I know into each life
There's always, a little rain
But I never, no I'll never understand
Why my life has so much pain

Maybe someday you'll tell me why
Why you had to hurt me
And leave me here to cry
I played a losing game
But life goes on and on just the same
