I can laugh
When things ain't funny
A haha-happy-go-lucky me

Yeah, I can smile
When I ain't got no money
A ha ha-happy-go-lucky me

It may sound silly but
Mmm, I don't care
I got the moonlight
I got the sun
I've got the stars above

Me and my philly, well, we both share
This slappy go happy, happy go lucky love

Well! Life is sweet...whoa, sweet as honey
A haha-happy-go-lucky me
