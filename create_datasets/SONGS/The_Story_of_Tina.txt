The story of tina began in the spring time 
When tina was sweet seventeen.
The boy said he loved her and she gave a promise
The truest that ever has been.

And then came the wedding one morning in may
And still they are sweethearts 
Though years roll away
The story of tina is loves grand adventure
As sweet as a love song can be
The story of tina and me

musical interlude

And then came the wedding one morning in may
And still they are sweethearts
Though years roll away
The story of tina is loves grand adventure
As sweet as a love song can beeeee
The story of tina and meeeeeeeeeeee
