I am a lonely and a lonesome traveler
I am a lonely and a lonesome traveler
Well I am a lonely and a lonesome traveler
I've been a traveling on

I travel here and then I travel yonder well
I travel here and then I travel yonder well

I traveled cold and then I traveled hungry well
I traveled cold and then I traveled hungry well
I traveled cold and then I traveled hungry well

I traveled in the mountains and traveled in the valleys
I traveled in the mountains and traveled in the valleys
I traveled in the mountains and traveled in the valleys
Well I've been a traveling on

Traveled with the rich men and traveled with the poor
Traveled with the rich men and traveled with the poor
Traveled with the rich men and traveled with the poor
I've been a traveling on

Hey one of these days I'm gonna stop all my traveling
Hey one of these days I'm gonna stop all my traveling
Hey one of these days I'm gonna stop all my traveling
Stop all this traveling on

I'm gonna keep right on traveling on that road to Glory
I'm gonna keep right on traveling on that road to Glory
I'm gonna keep right on traveling on that road to Glory
Gonna keep right on a traveling on
