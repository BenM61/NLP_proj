I wonder how you look when you sleep
Do you still dream about girls from your street?
Do you still dream about girls from high school?
Do you still dream about girls, girls, girls?

I wonder how you feel when you kiss
I wonder how soft are your lips
Do you still think about girls from last week?
Do you still think about girls, girls girls?

I am a marble, the color of candy
I'll make you money whenever you're gambling
I am the dice you roll in the alley
I am the pennies that come in handy

I wonder how you feel when you're sad
Do you still cry about girls that you've had?
Do you still cry about girls you wanted?
Do you still cry about girls, girls, girls?

I am a marble, the color of candy
I'll make you money whenever you're gambling
I am the dice you roll in the alley
I am the pennies that come in handy

I wonder how you look when you're happy
Do you still sing about girls from last week?
Do you still sing about girls from last year?
Do you still sing about girls, girls, girls?

Girls, girls, girls
Girls, girls, girls
Girls, girls, girls
