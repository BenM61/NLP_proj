For caring is a breeze that blows by
And returns only when, only when it wants to
So cry, cry little angel forever because

You can't wrap your arms around the wind
Within lie the reasons for
This tangled web we weave

For love at once my shield and terror
Destination and cause for living today
And wanting to die tomorrow
Why is my whole life spent chasing my demise

You can't wrap your arms around the wind
Within lie the reasons for
This tangled web we weave

In my face you see the torture lines from days gone by
But I was never touched these scars have risen from within me.

For memory take a knife it's quicker
Plunge it deep into my soul
Go ahead make me a weaker man
And cry, cry little angel because

You can't wrap your arms around the wind
Within lie the reasons for
This tangled web we weave
