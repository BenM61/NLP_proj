If it had not been for the Lord who was on my side 
I don't know where I would be
Fellowship, let's go

My testimony is real
I came this far by faith
My road ain't always been smooth
But I don't look like what I been through
Truth is I'm kept, bless by the best, and one word describes the rest

Everybody say grace
Grace
Everybody say grace

My faith, my future looks bright
He's brought me from a mighty long way
I walk by faith and not sight 
Oh yeah that's how I made it where I am today
Truth is I'm kept, bless by the best, and one word describes the rest
Everybody say grace
(Grace)
Everybody say grace

I don't deserve it (undeserved) 
I'm talking bout me (unearned)
You know me, you know me better than I do (unmerited)
(Favor) I make some mistakes(undeserved) and I'm not right all the time (unearned)

Hey, sometimes I feel like I can't make it, but I'm making it, it's because of your grace

God is good all the time and all the time God is good
I want you to know wherever you need God's grace
It's always sufficient, on time and exactly what you need
Amazing grace how sweet 
How sweet, how sweet
Amazing grace how sweet 
Your grace is Sweet
Sweet and it gets sweeter, sweeter (amazing grace how sweet)
Whoa sweeter, sweeter, sweeter
Amazing grace how sweet
Lord thank you for being sweet to me
