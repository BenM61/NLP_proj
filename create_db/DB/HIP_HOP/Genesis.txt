Genesis, Genesis
Genesis, Genesis
Genesis, Genesis
Genesis, Genesis

[Chorus]
As we welcome you all to the future
Oh! We come to give you that
Operating like we be official
Yeah! We come to multiply
And we're planning the scheme for the long run
Yeah! Our shit be always right
Every move you'll see how it's related

Genesis, Genesis, Genesis

[Chorus]

Genesis, Genesis, Genesis

While we continuously stay sculpturing bombs
Love unconditional greetings with opening arms
And for my worthy niggaz I'ma die trying for y'all
With the blessing of an angel's tear crying for y'all
Back to the foundation, taking you under back where it all started
With a whole new beginning and a brand new hunger
Starving to where my skin was suffocating my ribs
Now we got bitches interior decorating my crib
Touch the love I got like you holding my heart in my hand
And watch my manifesto, shit was all a part of the plan
The fashion that I choose to deal with this shit
Sometimes it's so hard to describe the passion that I feel for this shit
How many struggles I survived just to eat this meal
Never thought y'all meet a nigga that could be this real
Flipmode up in this bitch now let me make you aware
Too late for turning back my nigga cause we taking it there

[Chorus]

[Busta Rhymes]
Genesis, Genesis, Genesis
And leave!

And leave a mark until it's deep in the floor
Y'all niggas fucked up never should've let let me get my feet in the door
And then I step through, f*ck wiping my feet at the door 
I be the deacon I'm beating niggas and speaking the raw
Strictly raw shit is what niggas be seeking me for
Testing my strength, that's what the devil's try to weaken me for
C'mon, yes and y'all off to the next step, for sure
Rep and make you want to accept more
Niggas analyze the jewel that I reveal in a rhyme
I'm like something that has evolved about a million times
Peep the display with all the new features
The way we really doing it, these motherfuckers probably wouldn't believe us
Flipmode Squad by all means, a pledge of allegiance
With the great feeling of people like the coming of Jesus
While a lot of other niggas don't be telling you nothing
That be the same bullshit that's always pushing my buttons
Godly is how we rep this undeniable force
You like a weak preacher, swearing smacked dead on a cross
Kick niggaz like the two back legs of a horse
Chop ya fingers for tryin' to put your hands in the sauce
Sometimes I think that it would be best if you run
And do yourself a favor, cause you got your whole life
Ahead of you son!
A whole new thing starting for me
Smell so much ass in a spot, the beat got the world farting for me
When I spit you know I always love to garnish it hard
While you love-it hate-it niggas trying to tarnish the God
I know some dudes that would love to bring the hatred to y'all
While I continue to bless you with shit that's is sacred to y'all
Even if I had to bend you in place
I always put it down and rep my niggas from the most genuine place
From my street corner niggas to my live niggas everywhere
Too late for turning back, we taking it there

[Chorus]
