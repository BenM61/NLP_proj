Saw a silhouette across a fluorescent 
Floating overhead, undoing his helmet 
Through the murky beams and blue-green sea life 
I saw him spinnin' towards the moonlight 
I pull him in, he wasn't breathin' 
His eyes were wide and I saw two of me there 
There's an ugly buzz that hovers just above the quiet 
Found a way to make it silent 
I'm comin' up for air [Repeat: x2]

Air [Repeat: x2]

They hold my hand and ask me to pull through 
A voice I know says "Dear, he probably can't hear you"
Comin' up for air [Repeat: x3]
