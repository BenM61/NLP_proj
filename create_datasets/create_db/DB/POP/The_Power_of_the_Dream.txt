Deep within each heart
There lies a magic spark
That lights the fire of our imagination
And since the dawn of man
The strength of just "I can"
Has brought together people of all nations

There's nothing ordinary
In the living of each day
There's a special part
Every one of us will play

Feel the flame forever burn
Teaching lessons we must learn
To bring us closer to the power of the dream
As the world gives us its best
To stand apart from all the rest
It is the power of the dream that brings us here

Your mind will take you far
The rest is just pure heart
You'll find your fate is all your own creation
And every boy and girl
As they come into this world
They bring the gift of hope and inspiration

Feel the flame forever burn
Teaching lessons we must learn
To bring us closer to the power of the dream
The world in lights and hope and peace
We'll pray that you will always be
It is the power of the dream that brings us here

There's so much strength in all of us
Every woman child and man
It's the moment that you think you can't
You'll discover that you can

Feel the flame forever burn
Teaching lessons we must learn
(To bring us closer to) the power of the dream
The world in lights and hope and peace
(We'll pray that) it will always be
It is the power of the dream that brings us here

Feel the flame (forever burn)
Teaching (lessons we must learn)
(To bring us closer to) the power of the dream
(The world in lights and hope and peace)
We'll pray that it will always be
(It is) the power of the dream that brings us,

(The power of the dream)
(The faith in things unseen)
(The courage to embrace your fear)
(No matter where you are)
(To reach for your own star)
To realize the power of the dream
To realize the power of the dream
