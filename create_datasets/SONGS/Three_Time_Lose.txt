How many teardrops gonna fall tonight?
How many heartaches must a woman have in one life?
I lost a lover, lost a friend
Through with love I just can't win.

Three time loser
Three time loser.
One, two three in misery. 
Three time loser.
 
How many hours your love I'm gonna wait?
How many heartaches you really think I'm gonna take?
I lost a lover, lost my friend, 
You were that kind, woh you will never win.
