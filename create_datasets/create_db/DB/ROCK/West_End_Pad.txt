No one can do all the things you do
And stimulate the G-rays
No one can do all the things you do
And leave me in the same way
No one can do all the things you do
And elevate my pulse rate

I've tried a west end pad and a classic car
My favorite drink in my favorite bar
A few close friends and a movie star
But they still leave me wanting you again

No one can do all the things you do
And hit me in the right place
No one can do all the things you do
And leave me in the same way

I've tried a west end pad and a classic car
My favorite drink in my favorite bar
A few close friends and a movie star
But they still leave me wanting you again

And every single time
I ask myself why it never feels the same
And every single time
I have quizzed my mind till I nearly racked my brain
But I think still
It's amazing

I've tried a west end pad and a classic car
My favorite drink in my favorite bar
A few close friends and a movie star
But they still leave me wanting you again
