Sometimes I sit yeah, feeling alone
No one to talk to I got no telephone
And at night I wake up, I just lie and stare
Come on and save me from this nightmare

Hi ho silver, here come the lone ranger
He's riding on down to rescue me

I know the road I must take, with a wink of my eye
I leave old friends behind like old alibi
I take all they throw against me I make a stand
For truth and justice and for the common man

Hi ho silver, here come the lone ranger
He's riding on down to rescue me

And I guess it took some time for me to decide
If you were just my hero, or my friend
Watching with my innocent eyes
Your silver stallion ride
across my room I'd listen as they cried

Hi ho silver, here come the lone ranger
He's riding on down to rescue me
