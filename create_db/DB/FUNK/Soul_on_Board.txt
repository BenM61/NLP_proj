I was born at the wrong time
A child lost on the skyline
When I felt a need to change
So I looked deep within me
Somehow touched by the real me
Had to find another way

[Chorus]
So take the heart of this man
Heal the pain with your hands
Shelter me from the rain
Help my eyes see again
Free me
Hold me close
And take my soul on board

Shallow waters we drown in
From the deep you are calling
And with your touch I drift away

[Chorus]

With fear and pride I live and die
A silver light in the blue night
You come to me

Take my heart be my guide
Lay your strength by my side
And cover me from the rain
Now my eyes can see again
Free me
Hold me close
Through dark skies you led my spirit home
You took my soul on board
