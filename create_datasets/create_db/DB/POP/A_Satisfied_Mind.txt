How many times have you heard someone say 
"If I had his money, I could do things my way?" 
Little they know that it's so hard to find 
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind. 

Once I was winning in fortune and fame 
Everything that I dreamed for to get a start in life's game 
Suddenly it happened, I lost every dime 
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind 

Money can't buy back your youth when you're old 
Or a friend when you're lonely, or a love that's grown cold 
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times 
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind 

When my life is ended, my time has run out 
My trials and my loved ones, I'll leave them no doubt 
But one thing's for certain, when it comes my time 
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind 
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind
