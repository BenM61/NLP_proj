Talk to me, oh yeah
So talk to me, oh yeah
So talk to me, yeah
So talk to me, oh yeah

Fire but I still start
When I saw you on my way out
I rolled all my sleeves up
Let me be your situation

See you want my heart, it's a silly thing to start, yeah
I can tell you know what it takes to make me fall apart

So here we are, it's going down
Such a sweet talker, turning me around
You ain't gotta look like a movie star
'Cause boy you sound so sweet, you can have it all
Talking about, a teachers pet,
Baby you look cute when you make my bed
You just keep singing those lullabies
Sweet talk me all night honey pie

So talk to me, oh yeah (sweet talker, sweet talker)
So talk to me, oh yeah (sweet talker, sweet talker)
So talk to me, yeah
So talk to me, oh yeah (sweet talker, sweet talker)

Now you're a Casanova,
Now put your money where your mouth is
I think I'll keep my heels off
You don't know what just started

See you want my heart, it's a silly thing to start
I can tell you know what it takes to make me fall apart

So here we are, it's going down
Such a sweet talker, turning me around
You ain't gotta look like a movie star
'Cause boy you sound so sweet, you can have it all
Talk about, a teachers pet,
Baby you look cute when you make my bed
You just keep singing those lullabies
Sweet talk me all night honey pie

Talk to me, oh yeah (sweet talker, sweet talker)
So talk to me, oh yeah (sweet talker, sweet talker)
So talk to me, yeah
So talk to me, oh yeah (sweet talker, sweet talker)

Hope you know I'm rolling solo after tonight, oh yeah (talk to me oh yeah)
'Cause I can play this game with my eyes closed, baby, shake it off, okay (talk to me oh yeah)
So you can make me feel so good
I'm a make you feel, talk to me oh yeah

Talk to me, yeah
So talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, baby

So here we are, it's going down
Such a sweet talker, turning me around
You ain't gotta look like a movie star
'Cause boy you sound so sweet, you can have it all
Talk about, a teachers pet,
Baby you look cute when you make my bed
You just keep singing those lullabies
Sweet talk me all night honey pie, yeah

So talk to me (Sweet talker, sweet talker)
So Talk to me (sweet talker, sweet talker)
