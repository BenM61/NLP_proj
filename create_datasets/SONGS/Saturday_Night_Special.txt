Every man should have the right to own a gun
Every man should have the right to shoot someone

Film stars and farmers still forcing opinions
Like TV politicians playing cowboys and Indians
Uncle Sam sleeps with his horse, keeps his brain in his hat
With his trigger-happy patter, he'll rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat

Ride into the sun the damage is done

Every man should have the right to take a wife
Every man should have someone to share his life

Keep her at home with the kids and the cooking
So wholesome and clean when the neighbors are looking
She's mother and angel and courtesan too
Always hot in the bedroom, she's dressed just for you

Ride into the sun the damage is done

Every man should have the right to raise a son
Every man should have the right to choose his young

A son is a credit to the family name
But a daughter can only bring worry and shame
You can solve all your problems with a small operation
Protecting your manhood by swift termination

Ride into the sun the damage is done
