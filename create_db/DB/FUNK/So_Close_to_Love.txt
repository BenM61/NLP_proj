We were a flower 
That never reach full bloom 
We never gave our love much chance to grow 
Even though the feeling was wonderful 
We went on our separate ways 
And all we know 
It's what we share is more than most 

[Chorus] 
'Cause we came all so very close to love 
But we let it slip away 
I always wondered why 
You never chose to stay 
So close to love 
Sometimes it seems like it was only yesterday 
I find myself dreaming of 
How we came all so very close to love 

I always remember 
The way you care for me 
Time after time my life was in despair 
Yet somehow I always knew you'll be right there 
At times I did not have a prayer 
I'm sure that you and I both know 

[Chorus] 

That we came all so very close to love 
But we let it slip away 
I always wondered why 
You never chose to stay 
So close to love 
Sometimes it seems like it was only yesterday 
And I think I had a lover 
And we came all so very close to love 
 
How can I face the fact it's over 
We're through 
I can't believe it's true 
When I'm alone 
Sometimes I wonder if you knew 
How much I care for you 
So I'm hanging on to the memories 
How hard you make sweet love to me 
And it's so hard to let it go 

[Chorus]
 
When we came all so very close to love 
But we let it slip away 
I always wondered why 
You never chose to stay 
So close to love 
Sometimes it seems like it was only yesterday 
I find myself dreaming of 
How we came all so very close to love 
We let it slip away 
I always wonder why 
You never chose to
