On a boat, on a beach
In the water, in the sand, in the back of a bar
Cold beer in your hand
Breaking hearts, breaking necks
When we rolling down the street, heads turning all day when they see you with me
I'm thinking everybody better stand in line
'Cause they need to know that your body's coming with me tonight

They're like, "hey, who that there with the shades?"
Like oh, the way you move to the bass
Hold up
Whole room gets to spinnin' from the second that you walk in
And baby you look good all day, all night
You look good, so fresh, so fine
You look good, got everybody watching you like cameras in Hollywood
Baby you look good
Aw baby you look good

Black dress, 2 the 9s, New Year's in a pent
From the floor, to the roof, make the skyline spin
Yeah, you're killing me boy in your black-faded jeans
Ain't gotta work hard when you're smilin' at me

Like, "hey, who that there with the shades?"
Like oh, the way you move to the bass
Hold up
Whole room gets to spinnin' from the second that you walk in
And baby you look good all day, all night
You look good, so fresh, so fine
You look good, got everybody watching you like cameras in Hollywood
Baby you look good
Aw baby you look good

I'm thinking everybody better stand in line
'Cause they need to know that your body's coming with me tonight

They're like, "hey, who that there with the shades?"
Like oh, the way you move to the bass
Hold up
Whole room gets to spinnin' from the second that you walk in
And baby you look good all day, all night
You look good, so fresh, so fine
You look good, got everybody watching you like cameras in Hollywood
Baby you look good
Come on baby you look good
You look good
Baby you look good
