Yo Cass what up son
What's goin' on playboy, how's it lookin' over there?
You know I got me a good one ands all that
Oh ok,ok
Wats up with you
You know I got me something lovely too you know how we do it
You know how like em man, super official right
All day if it ain't official I ain't fucin wit her
That's right son
Ha ha yea,let's do it

[Chorus]
So many nights I felt like crying (can't get you out my mind)
All this time I felt like dyin
(love's so hard to find)
So I (gotta move on)
Yes I (gotta stay strong)
And I (gotta keep it going)
So long (so long)

It's usually the beauty that attract me
But perhaps she was the right person,
Her personality made me happy and that's why I pursued her
I'm a dude that make manoeuvres
If I choose her then she whipped cause my dick as long as a ruler,
She maybe kind of crazy its cool long as I school her
I'm smooth as Grand Poobah and I can charm a computer,
For us to conversate all it take to make an impression
Like a teacher lecturing when I'm speaking she taking lessons,
But every time we argue and fight I feel like I'm dying,
I feel like trying tell you the truth,
You feel like I'm lyin but I'm a move on cause I'm strong as ever
Without you, I can do better but I can never forget about you girl.

[Chorus]

Ay yo I laced you with the girl braces when you was young,
Doing ya thang I went to amfye and buy you dem benaces,
Queen of the temple with the sent of a Lemon
All of that lenin shit at time I'm just observing your menin with all that long hair,
Sexy, mean walk and your von gear we at the pond you all up
Under my arm when we shopping embracing your re-lock and gloks and tims
Flyin from Africa yo back to the, you just a sadosure that's why your ones is owsed
Up cause when I needed you, you never got flossed up a laced out lady with taste
I gotta just kiss ya face keep ya nigga growned these are the brakes. One!

[Chorus]

Without her being close is depressing,
They say ain't nobody perfect but a honey rosted complexion
Close to perfection plus she got a body that could
Probably turn a gay man straight, to stay in shape mommy started taking karate,
So while she get it done in the gym runnin the treadmill I'm runnin for feds
Still, keep one in the bed still I be reminiscing boo,
Missin you that's dead real cause you nice in the bed
And you nice with the hand skills you awfully fine,
I can't get you off my mind, I ain't frontin yea I lost a dime
But you crossed the line and ain't follow directions you gone, gettin back together is out
Of the question, I moved on.

[Chorus]
