We don't need no drama
Don't need problems in my head
We don't need no drama

Dancin' to a different tempo
Could just be an echo
I've been reflectin' our perspective
And now I know
That love is never simple
No matter high or low
And if it brings you pain then it's okay
For you to let go

We don't need no drama
Don't need problems in my head
We don't need no drama
Dance with my body instead
When the night falls on us
One by one we will forget
Every bit of that drama

'Cause we don't need no drama-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma
Need that drama-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma
'Cause we don't need no drama-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma
Need that drama-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma

Talkin' in a different lingo
You told me your heart broke
You've been reflectin', countin' blessings
And now you know
That love is never simple
No matter where it goes
And if it brings you pain then it's okay
For you to let go

Things are never simple
I guess if you don't wanna change your mind
You just gotta let me know
I told you before, told you before though
I just wanna dance with you, get involved
Forget all the drama, it's getting old
And if it brings you pain then it's okay
For you to let go

We don't need no drama
Don't need problems in my head
We don't need no drama
Dance with my body instead
When the night falls on us
One by one we will forget
Every bit of that drama

'Cause we don't need no drama-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma
Need that drama-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma
'Cause we don't need no drama-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma
Need that drama-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma, yeah

We don't need
The problems in my head
We don't need
The things we don't forget
We don't need
Oh, dance with me instead
We don't need
We don't need, need no drama

('Cause we don't need no drama)
We don't no drama
Don't need problems in my head (need no drama)
We don't no drama
Dance with my body instead
When the night falls on us
One by one we will forget
Every bit of that drama
'Cause we don't need no drama
