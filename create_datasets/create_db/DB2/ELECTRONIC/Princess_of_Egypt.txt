I'm coming home
And I don't want to hear another word about this
It's hard to fight well
And come alone back from the abyss
No more of them lunatic thoughts time's up
For the Don Quixote
All I ever wanted was to give this my best shot

The sad part is that you come
From a different kind of life
I'm up and leaving now I'm living by the knife
I've lost my faith in human kind and it's time for a rest
Even though I did my best I didn't pass your test

You are the princess of Egypt and I'm just a man
I want to be with you, I feel astray
I need a miracle how to make you understand
I'd make you happy but you're far away

You don't know what you're missing
What it is you leave behind
My good intentions for you makes me one of a kind
You'll get by in your fortress
You will hide behind that wall
But one day you will find out you almost had it all

The sad part is that you come
From a different kind of life
I'm up and leaving now I'm living by the knife
I've lost my faith in human kind and it's time for a rest
Even though I did my best I didn't pass your test

You are the princess of Egypt and I'm just a man
I want to be with you, I feel astray
I need a miracle how to make you understand
I'd make you happy but you're far away
