Ya ma said you cried in your sleep last night
Ya ma said you cried in your sleep last night
You should've seen that look in her eyes
I had to tell her some little white lies
I know I haven't been so true to you
I know I haven't been so true to you
Don't ya cry
Don't ya cry
Don't ya cry no more
Please
Ain't gonna be the way it was before

Oh
My love
Oh
My love - let me kiss you
Let me hold you tight
Oh
My love
Oh
My love
And your ma said you cried
Your ma said you cried
Your ma said you cried in your sleep last night
I know I haven't been so true to you

Oh
My love
Oh
My love - let me kiss you
Let me hold you tight
Oh
I love you
Oh
I love you, don't you cry
Don't you cry
And your ma said you cried
And your ma said you cried
Your ma said you cried
Your ma said you cried
Your ma said you cried
Oh
Your ma said you cried in your sleep last night
