You are the chosen one
to battlefield you're ready to go
Sail away to the land of the damned
Survive from the dragon's claws

You're the one to save our lord
(You've got to fight! Kill 'em all!!)
There's no one else but you
who can conquer the beast
(You've got to fight! Kill 'em all!!)

You have that special gift
that's given from above
You are stronger than the gods
A warrior of flesh of blood

Save us & bring back the heart
our future lies upon your arms
Save us you know that you must
tomorrow might never show up
You got to fight

We put our faith in you
we pray for you to win this fight
You are our only hope
complete your task and come back alive

Sailing away, to unknown land
Now is the time, to face the demons
Tracking it down, I'm ready to fight
Sharpen my sword, to slay the dragon
