It's harder than it looks to move through water
First you've got to paddle like a pup
You see yourself, you're sure you're lamb to slaughter
So you take what was pure and muck it up

But I'll throw my hands up and drag myself through
And I'll kick my feet cause I've learned to crawl
It's really impressive, when I was just drowning
I'll crawl, might as well be a butterfly

I could hold my breath and just stay under
But now there's rings of fire on the lake
Lookin' back from here I have to wonder
Just how much did I think that I could take

So I'll throw my hands up and drag myself through
And I'll kick my feet cause I've learned to crawl
It's really impressive, when I was just drowning
I'll crawl, might as well be a butterfly
I'll crawl, it's really impressive, when I was just drowning
I'll crawl, might as well be a butterfly

Hand over hand over hand
Hand over hand 'til I believe that I can stand
I'll crawl

I'll crawl, it's really impressive, when I was just drowning
I'll crawl, might as well be a butterfly
I'll crawl, it's really impressive, when I was just drowning
I'll crawl, might as well be a butterfly

I'll crawl
