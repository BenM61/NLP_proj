Lady luck ain't playing on my side
Lady luck ain't smiling down
Lady luck don't care about my pride
Lady luck lays it down

I get this feeling I can dream tonight
Yeah I've been seeing all the signs
A dream no one can dream to undermine
This time I am gonna get it right
Lady luck ain't playing on my side
Lady luck ain't smiling down
Lady luck don't care about my pride
Lady luck lays it down

Sometimes I wish I could anesthetize
Bring up the lows bring down the highs
She is the one I need to sympathise
She is the one who sees me cry
And I've been waiting for her day and night
I know my lady is around
I would put everything I have on the line
And I will get better odds than now
Lady luck I need a little light
Lady luck I need you now
Lady luck you have to make it right
Lady luck don't let me down
And it ain't something you can synthesise
It ain't something you can buy
Ain't got nothing to do with wrong and right
Got everything to do with time
Lady luck you save my life tonight
Lady luck I owe you now
Lady luck I'll be a better guy
Lady I'll share your luck around
Lady luck is standing by my side
Lady luck won't let me drown
Lady luck shows me a better sign
Lady luck lays it down.
