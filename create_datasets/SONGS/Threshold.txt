There are clouds on the horizon
Shifting colours, heavy rain
High above the roaring thunder
Shooting bullets through your brain

There's something wicked left behind
A baleful sight, a coming
A sinister state of your minds

Behold the skies, the port of heaven
See the stairway down to hell
The gate is open, lift the curse
We set aside our dreams and visions
We are one we will unite
At the Threshold of the universe we will rise

Late at night they heard the sirens
From a place so far away
Allied forces, mighty brethren
In a vesture of decay

They are the legions of the night
Turning darkness into?
Turning the dark into light

Behold the skies, the port of heaven
See the stairway down to hell
The gate is open, lift the curse
We set aside our dreams and visions
We are one we will unite
At the Threshold of the universe

Solo: Stefan

Behold the skies, the port of heaven
See the stairway down to hell
The gate is open, lift the curse
We set aside our dreams and visions
We are one we will unite
At the Threshold of the universe
