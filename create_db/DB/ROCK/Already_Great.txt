I'm Canadian by the way
And I love the USA (my American friend)
I love this way of life
The freedom to act and the freedom to say

Already great
You're already great
You're the promised land
You're the helping hand

Woke up this morning
Thinking about you and your new deal (my American friend)
Trying to put myself in your shoes
Trying to feel how you feel

Already great
You're already great
You're the promised land
You're the helping hand

No wall
No ban
No fascist USA

No wall
No ban
No fascist USA

(No wall) not my words (no ban)
That's just you the other day out on that street (my American friend)
You're looking at one of the lucky ones
Came here from there to be free

Got to chase the life with Freedom land
Got to play my part in God's plan (my American friend)

Already great
You're already great
You're the promised land
You're the helping hand

No wall
No ban
No fascist USA

No wall
No ban
No fascist USA

No wall
No ban
No fascist USA

No wall
No ban
No fascist USA
