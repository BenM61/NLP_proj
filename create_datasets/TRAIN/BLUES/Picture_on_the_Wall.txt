Yes, you know your picture done faded now, baby, darling, you left hanging up on the wall 
Yes, you know your picture done faded now, baby, darling, you lea hanging up on the wall 
Yes you know it done faded so now, baby, I can't see your face at all 
Still, that old clock is ticking, baby, you left hanging on the side 
Yes, you know that clock's still ticking, baby, you left hanging on the side 
Yes, you know it put my mind on to wondering, make me want to catch some freight train and ride 
Yes I would have done caught me a freight train, but there is nary 
a one going my way 
Yes I would have done caught me a freight train, nary a one is going my way 
Yes, but if I don't see you pretty soon, I hope I'll meet you some old rainy day
