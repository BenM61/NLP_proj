I hope you never lose your sense of wonder 
You get your fill to eat but always keep that hunger 
May you never take one single breath for granted 
God forbid love ever leave you empty handed 
I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean 
Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens 
Promise me that you'll give fate the fighting chance 
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance 

I hope you dance 
I hope you dance 

I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance 
Never settle for the path of least resistance 
Living might mean taking chances but they're worth taking 
Lovin' might be a mistake but it's worth making 
Don't let some hell bent heart leave you bitter 
When you come close to selling out reconsider 
Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance 
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance 

I hope you dance 
(Time is a wheel in constant motion always) 
I hope you dance 
(Rolling us along) 
I hope you dance 
(Tell me who wants to look back on their years and wonder) 
I hope you dance 
(Where those years have gone) 

I hope you still feel small when you stand by the ocean 
Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens 
Promise me that you'll give faith the fighting chance 
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance 

Dance 
I hope you dance 
I hope you dance 
(Time is a wheel in constant motion always) 
I hope you dance 
(Rolling us along) 
I hope you dance 
(Tell me who wants to look back on their years and wonder) 
I hope you dance 
(Where those years have gone) 
(Tell me who wants to look back on their years and wonder) 
I hope you dance 
(Where those years have gone)
