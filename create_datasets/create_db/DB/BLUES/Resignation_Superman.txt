He'll come flying out of this town
A resignation superman
And today the bad guys win
'Cause he turned his cape in
Now, he says
And I'll turn my back on this world
Yes, I'll turn my eyes from this world
Oh well 

Yes, he's tired of fighting in this town
All the suffering and vice
He wants to fall in love 
Maybe settle in and live a life
And I'll turn my back on this world
Yes, I'll turn my eyes form this world 

Oh I want to believe in you now that I'm suffering
Oh lord, I need to receive your hand in my heart 

And he keeps an eye upon this town
The resignation superman
He'll keep himself amused
With the evening news
Oh my 
And I'll turn my back on this world
Yes, I'll turn my eyes from this world
Now I broke my back on this world
Now I'll wash my hands of this world 

Oh I want to believe in you now that I'm suffering
Oh lord, I need to receive your hand in my heart
