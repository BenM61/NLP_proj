Some say it's just the nature of the beast
When you love somebody so passionately
Time has a way of stealing
That raging fire feeling
Leaving the ashes laying at your feet

Those fools of little faith will never know
That higher place two hearts can go
Where time is standing still
And love will burn until
The heavens and the earth have come and gone

This fire inside for you is constant as the northern star
And you will be forever in my heart
As long as there's a river searching for an endless sea
I will always love you
Faithfully

Tonight we'll raise a glass to lovers
Across the ages
We'll hold each other
And toast to the day
When history's said and done
And we still stand as one
Some things were never meant to fade away

This fire inside for you is constant as the northern star
