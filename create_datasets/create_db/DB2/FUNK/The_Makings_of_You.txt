Add a little sugar, honeysuckle and a great big expression of happiness
Boy, you couldn't miss with a dozen roses
Such would astound you the joy of children laughing around you
These are the makings of you, it is true the makings of you

It's been a miracle for what you've done
Please stay right by my side two can be one
The righteous way to go
Little one would know or believe if I told them so

You're second to none the love all mankind
Should reflect some sign of the words I've tried to recite
They're close but not quite almost impossible to do
Describing the makings of you
