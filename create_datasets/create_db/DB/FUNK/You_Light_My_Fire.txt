You light my fire
You light my fire
Come on and teach me all of your philosophy
Desires running wild for learning inside me
Ou ou ou ou ou ou discover all we can
Ou ou ou ou ou ou of nature art and man

You light my fire
You light my fire
You opened up my door in every single way
Because of you it's true I'm leaving every day
Ou ou ou ou ou ou well it's a crying shame
Ou ou ou ou ou ou when no one lights your flame
I'm shaking my roots
New boots
Honey I'm learning everything
All a new
Hey hey hey

You light my fire
You light my fire
A passing shooting star has lost a silver spark
And it's the fuse
You used when you lit up my heart

You light my fire
You light my fire
It's such a lonely town when you are out of sight
And my heart's wearing tears when you are late at night
Ou ou ou ou ou ou you knock me of my feet
Ou ou ou ou ou ou you're loving really neat
I'm travelling your way
To stay
You've made my world so beautiful and so true
Hey hey hey

You light my fire
Higher
AII my desires concentrating on you
Hey hey hey

Oh it's getting higher ou ou a blazing fire
I need you
You need me too
In my soul I feel it burning
Can't you see it burnin'
Hot hot I can't control it
Losin' my control
You've got my heart on fire
Danger explode 
Beating with desire
Stop stop don't overload.

Fire
Fire you light my fire
Fire you light my fire
Fire oh light my fire
Fire ou light my fire
You light my fire
I'm on fire
You light my fire
Come on and light my fire
You light my fire
I'm on fire
You light my fire
Come on and light my fire
You light my fire
You light my fire
You light my fire
You light my fire
You light my fire
