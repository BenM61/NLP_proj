It's time to cut the slack now
You're gonna hear me ballin' truth
Back out from the underworld I'm here now
I've got something to prove
So hush keep up now serious
I'm telling you that she's one of a kind
Keep all your fingers to yourself
I'm here to take back what's mine
Hear me say
Oooooooooooooh, this time you're all mine
Oooooooooooooh, let it shine

[chorus]
I can't get you off my mind, I just want to be with you
You're the best I'll ever find, I want to be with you
I can't get you off my mind, I just want to be with you
You're the best I'll ever find, I want to be with you

I'm on a mission from God I'm crazy
This war I'll win for sure
My middle name is Overkill keep watching
You'll see that I will score
Boom boom when we come across the sea
Whatever we search for we will find
Keep all your fingers to yourself
I'm here to take back what's mine
Hear me say
Oooooooooooooh, this time you're all mine
Oooooooooooooh, let it shine

[chorus]

Hear me I'm here to take back what's mine, I just want to be with you
Whatever I search for I will find, I want to be with you
Hear me I'm here to take back what's mine, I just want to be with you
Whatever I search for I will find, I want to be with you
I can't get you off my mind
You're the best I'll ever find
I want to be with you

[chorus]

Hear me I'm here to take back what's mine, I just want to be with you
Whatever I search for I will find, I want to be with you
Hear me I'm here to take back what's mine, I just want to be with you
Whatever I search for I will find, I want to be with you
