Everybody speeds in the fast lane truly now
Revving through the cares tryna keep ourselves from stressing out, out
Take a look at your heart and your soul
This is it, is it all that you are
We're so caught up in the rhythm and we suffer for so little, oh Lord

Holding on the tears on the last train home bound
It's been twenty- seven years and you've only now just figured out, out
You can it more than your soul
You can give it everything even the house that you own
But when you're caught up in the riddle
Man you're fighting with the nickel, no no
