Hey! Listen now it's coming so close
I'll let the rhythm surround me
I'm getting itchy and I'm ready to move
I'm mighty glad that you found me
There's a drummer going at it way down in the core of my soul
There's no escaping the music and I'm psyching up my feet
And they're telling me we're ready to roll

There are times when I can fight it but now's the time I want to give in
Sooner or later we'll get around to love
But now's the time to shake it
Oh Baby let the party begin
Baby let the party begin

When I woke up this morning and I looked out my window
I could see the sky was cloudy and gray
There was a chill in the air and a pain in my heart
And the thunder it was coming my way

Oh, it was looking pretty bad and I was so alone
And there was any place to go
But now I'm out of the blue, I know what I got to do
And something in me's starting to grow
I can feel it in me starting to grow...grow...grow...grow...

I got dance in my pants
Every time I feel the power in a radio wave
I turn it up all the way
I got dance in my pants
Every time I see the glory of a good-looking face
Well I just got to say:"Hey now, don't you worry baby, everything'll be fine
We got nothing but the best and we got nothing but time
And there'll always be a time when they'll be waiting in line
To be dancing, dancing..."

You don't say nothing all week, you're getting ready for
Dancing, dancing
And now your body really knows how to speak, you're getting ready for
Dancing, dancing
You don't say nothing all week, you're getting ready for
Dancing, dancing
Now your body really knows how to speak, you're getting ready
Come on, take a chance
You got a whole lotta style and a load of romance
And me, me, me... I got dance in my pants...

I got dance in my pants...
I got dance in my pants...

Boy:

I'm a lover not a dancer
I'm a lover not a dancer
Don't want to be on my feet when I can be on my back
Don't want to be on the floor when I can be in the sack

I'm a lover not a dancer
I'm a lover not a dancer
I'm just a little bit tired if you know what I mean
Don't want to be in a crowd when I can be in a dream

I'm a lover not a dancer, Baby
Baby let me prove it to you
Baby let me prove it to you

Girl:

We can rock it really hard or we can roll it really slow
We can lift it really high or we can dip it really low
We can hold it in tight or we can let it all out
Or we can work up a sweat and really stomp it and shout
Let me pull you so close and then we'll break away fast
We'll be the best on the floor we got the cool and the flash
We'll make a dangerous turn but we'll come out of it fine
I know the best of the moves we'll get them right every time

Boy:

I'm a lover not a dancer
I'm a lover not a dancer
Don't want to be on my feet when I can be on my back
Don't want to be on the floor when I can be in the sack
I'm a lover not a dancer
I'm a lover not a dancer
I'm just a little bit tired if you know what I mean
Don't want to be in a crowd when I can be in a dream
I'm a lover not a dancer, Baby
Baby let me prove it to you

I don't care what you say
Ain't nothing going to get me out on that floor...

Girl:

Oh baby, you know there may be some moves, that you haven't even seen yet

Boy:

No way, Jose!

Girl:

Well, I got a new step for you-
Made it up all by myself.
I bet you never tried this before.

Boy:

Oh, jeez.

Girl:

Come on.

Boy:

Oh, jeez.

Girl:

Come on!

Boy:

Oh, jeez!

Girl:

Now that you know how it's done, it's only a matter of practice

Boy:

Well, I could sure use some of that practice

Girl:

Now that you know how it's done, it's only a matter of practice

Boy:

Well, I could sure use some of that practice...
Grow, grow, grow, grow... grow, grow, grow, grow...
I got dance in my pants
Every time I feel the power in a radio wave I turn it up all the way
I got dance in my pants
Every time I see the glory of a good-looking face
Well I just got to say:
"Hey now, don't you worry, baby, everything'll be fine
We got nothing but the best and we got nothing but time
And there'll always be a time when they'll be waiting in line
To be dancing, dancing..."

You don't say nothing all week, you're getting ready for
Dancing, dancing
And now your body really knows how to speak, you're getting ready for
Dancing, dancing
You don't say nothing all week, you're getting ready for
Dancing, dancing
Now your body really knows how to speak, you're getting ready
Come on, take a chance
You got a whole lotta style and a load of romance
And me, me, me... I got dance in my pants...
I got dance in my pants...
I got dance in my pants...

Girl:

I'll crank it up all the way
They'll never get me to stop
I gotta stay in motion 'til the moment that I finally drop
When they decide that I'm gone
I know they're gonna try to put me to rest but I won't be afraid
Because I know, I know there's dance after death

Boy:

Oooh, I know there's dance after death
And I don't ever want to be rescued
I don't ever want to be saved
I got a feeling that I'm gonna be alive forever
Dancing on the edge of a grave
Dancing on the edge of a grave

Both:

And I don't ever want to be rescued
I don't ever want to be saved
I got a feeling that I'm gonna be alive forever
Dancing on the edge of a grave
Dancing on the edge of a...
Dancing on the edge of a...
Dancing on the edge of a grave
