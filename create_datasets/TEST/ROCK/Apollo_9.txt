Hey hey what do you say?
Had me a woman she ran away
Warned me one time, warned me twice
Found me out and it weren't too nice
Hey hey what do you say?
Had me a woman she ran away
Can the chatter, bye-bye dear
Carved me a crimson career
Well whoopsin-a whoopsin (dress it up)
Jan jan jammering (dress it up, dress it up)
Yabba-yabba-ding-ding (dress it up)

Delta hey max nine
We will be fine Apollo 9
Even though NASA say
"Way out of line"
"Out of line"
10 - dress it up
9 - dress it up etc
Hey hey what do you say?
Had me a woman she flew away
Climbed onto the nearest star
Miss her lots, but there you are
Hey hey what do you say?
Had me a woman she flew away

I don't worry, things are fine
Way up there in Apollo 9
Well whoopsin-a whoopsin (dress it up)
We will be fine Apollo 9 etc
Well whoopsin-a whoopsin (dress it up)
We will be fine Apollo 9 etc

You can run, you won't get far
A-leyber in your capella

Hey hey what do you say?
Had me a woman she flew away
Climbed onto the nearest star
Miss her lots, but there you are.
Hey hey what do you say?
Blast off time, I'm please to say
Write a letter, be home soon
Busy lassooing the moon.
10 - 9 - etc
