I am but a small voice
I have but a small dream
The fragrance of a flower
In the unpolluted air

I am but a small voice
I have but a small dream
To smile upon the sun
Be free to dance and sing
Be free to sing my song everywhere

Come young citizens of the world
We are one, we are one
Come young citizens of the world
We are one, we are one

We have one hope, we have one dream
And with one voice we sing

Peace, prosperity
(Give us peace, prosperity)
And love for all mankind
Peace, prosperity
(Give us peace, prosperity)
And love for all mankind

I am but a small voice
I have but a small dream
To smile upon the sun
Be free to dance and sing
Be free to sing my song to everyone

Come young citizens of the world
We are one, we are one
Come young citizens of the world
We are one, we are one

We have one hope, we have one dream
And with one voice we sing, we sing

Peace, prosperity
(Give us peace, prosperity)
And love for all mankind
Peace, prosperity
(Give us peace, prosperity)
And love for all mankind
