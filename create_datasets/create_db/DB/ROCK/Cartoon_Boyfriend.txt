"There's a worm in my head and a fish in the bed," she said
Confused you will be
He's got the car on the lawn and he's using the horn again
Annoyed she will be

[Chorus]
Cartoon boyfriend when you gonna rub yourself out

"There's a girl at my door and she's begging for more," he said
"Abused you will be"
"If you touch a hair on my head then you'd be better off dead"
She said "Oh joking you must be"

[Chorus]

There were pieces of gold in his mouth when they met
And now there's just pieces of coal
There was a thought in his head the first time she said
And now there's just a gaping hole

(They call him the Crayola Kid, yeah look what he did with his crayons
And stuff but, that's not enough, Crayola Kid.)
