Floating through the sky again
Will I ever find my way?
Maybe that's the point of it
Learning that the road don't end
To look around
Enjoy the sound
And take the beauty in

On this flight
On this high
I don't care what the world will say
'Cause I'm not coming down
'Cause I'm sure that the world
That I see in my mind is changed
And I'm not coming down today

Maybe there are no mistakes
Only what we have to face
So you don't have to feel regret
Join in for the ride instead

We're floating now
Above the ground
Hope this will never end
