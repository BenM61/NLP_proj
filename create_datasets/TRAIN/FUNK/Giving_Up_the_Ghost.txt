Red flows have broken free
They've opened up on me
And fuckin' shakes me down
Puts the dispute to sleep, ooh yeah

Come close to see me friend
My spirit's broken, bent
Come closer help me to

Give up the ghost
Don't talk about it
So I'm not hanging in the moment of surrender
So I'm not hanging in this moment for forever
Until I leave it too late

Give up the ghost
Don't talk about it
I won't be hanging in the moment of surrender
I won't be hanging in this moment for forever
Until I leave it too late

Where is that place of rest
Clearly not in my head
I come back with harder blows
'Til I clean up this mess

Come close to see me friend
My spirit's broken, bent
Come closer help me to

Give up the ghost
Don't talk about it
So I'm not hanging in the moment of surrender
So I'm not hanging in this moment for forever
Until I leave it too late

Give up the ghost
Don't talk about it
I won't be hanging in the moment of surrender
I won't be hanging in this moment for forever
Until I leave it too late

Give up the ghost
Don't talk about it
So I'm not hanging in the moment of surrender
So I'm not hanging in this moment for forever
Until I leave it too late

Give up the ghost
Don't talk about it
I won't be hanging in the moment of surrender
I won't be hanging in this moment for forever
Until I leave it too late

Give up the ghost

Give up the ghost
