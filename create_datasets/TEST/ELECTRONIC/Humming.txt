Closer
No hesitation
Give me
All that you have
And it's been so long, that I can't explain
And it's been so wrong
Right now, so wrong
Naked
My thoughts are creeping
Too late
The show has begun
And it's been so long, that I can't confess
And it's been so wrong
Right now, so wrong
Is it all as it seems
So unresolved, so unredeemed
If I remain, how will I know
And it's been so long, that I can't be sure
And it's been so wrong
Right now, so wrong
