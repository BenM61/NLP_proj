It's in my head now
It's in my mind now
It's in my face now
It's in my brain now

City of mutants
Darken then night
Evil illusion
Guided by light

The friends you thought
They never were
Egos and icons
They just don't care

You hope to die quiet
Laying in bed
It's better than pointing
A gun to your head

All cold and forgotten
You only feel pain
This quest for hope
Is a losing gain

Another dream crumbles
In front of your eyes
You're paranoid vision
Only sees spies
