Yo! I used to check out lyrics and pump the format 
Build with skill with technique, computer A-DAT 
My lyrical form is clouds on your brainstorm 
I get hyped think thought flow, acrobat, sink the track, pump the track 
Transmissions, close like spores react, past strong visions 
And hurrying more reflects on the dance floor 
Blowing up and having mad people showing up 
Packing crowds jam packed venues 
Needles collapse, while atmosphere continues 
To sprinkle that, 
Winnin' like that, movin' like that, hittin' like that 
The melody is phat 
Yo, I'm on the energy source 
The cosmic boss 
With Prodigy 
Given astrology 
My intellect's devour
With Diesel Power 
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically 
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically 
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically 
Blows your mind drastically, fanta.. 
We spin back rewind. Diesel Power 
Blows your mind drastically, fantasically 
It has to be, automatically 
Check it out. You better work it out 
Change to another bout
My techniques, strategies, abilities. 
Will leave cordless mics hanging like spring leads
Do a track so fast. Beyond from you and I
Lyrical tactics, vocal gymnastics 
Ease and pepped up 
You get swept up 
Smacked up, backed up, your crew's all cracked up 
Check it slow 
Pick choose quick 
You can't stick 
My medical range is strange as angles
You get tangled. Twist inside a fraction
Channels repeat, complete. Can't compete 
Check the hour texture 
Mind adventure 
Exploit the point 
Into tracks to devour 
My intellectual proceed
With diesel power 
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically 
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically 
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically 
Blows your mind drastically, fanta... 
Back attack the wack
Pack the fax to me
You don't want none 
High quality action, b, still standing 
Damaging your other manner
Quick reverse 
Potent as the first verse 
My amplifier blows on your world's higher 
World's sire 
Cuts like a barbed wire 
Record play
I pull up on you every day 
Fast forward 
I move and I swing torward 
Exit load 
Put your brain in right mode 
Selective mix 
The man will perfect the fix, heads lightly, bite me 
Copy Xereos. Cops' sandblocks 
You can't knocks them out there 
I'll keep lifting, shifting, persistant
Intelligent kingpin 
Given astrology 
As I roll with Prodigy 
With Diesel Power 
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically 
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically 
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically 
Blows your mind drastically, fanta...
