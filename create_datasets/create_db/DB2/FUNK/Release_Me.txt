Please release me, let me go
I don't love you anymore
To live together is a sin
So release me and let me love again

I have found a new love dear
And I'll always want him near
His lips are warm while yours are cold
So release me my darling let me go

Oh, please release me, let me go
I don't love you anymore
To live together is a sin
So release me and let me love again
