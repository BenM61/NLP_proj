Lord, I don't care where they
Bury my body

Bury my body
'Cause my soul is gonna live
With God, Oh
Bury my body
Lord, I don't care where they
Bury my body
Lord, I don't care where they
Bury my body
'Cause my soul is gonna live
With God, Oh
Lead me Jesus, lead me
Why don't you lead me in the middle of the air
And if my wings should fail me
Won't you provide me with another pair
Please God I don't care where they
Bury my body
Lord, I don't care where they
Bury my body

With God, Oh I said alright
You know it's alright
Alright

Bury my body
Lord, I don't care where they
Bury my body
'Cause my soul is gonna live
With God, Oh
Lead me Jesus, lead me
Why don't you lead me in the middle of the air
And if my wings should fail me
Won't you provide me with another pair
Please God I don't care where they
Bury my body
Lord, I don't care where they
Bury my body
'Cause my soul is gonna live
With God, Oh I said alright
My soul, my soul, my soul
Is gonna live, with God
