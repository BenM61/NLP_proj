Love was the thing that you wanted
That's why we answered loves call
Now that you've got what you wanted
You don't seem to want it at all

Careless
Now that you've got me loving you
You're careless
Careless in everything you do

You break up appointments and think you are smart
If you're not careful you'll break my heart

Careless
Now that my bridges all are burned
You're careless
Careless in things where I'm concerned
Are you just careless, as you seem to be
Or do you just care less for me?
