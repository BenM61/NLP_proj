In a village in the hills
House buried to the window sills in snow
In a prison yard at night
An Alsatian barking for the stars to go 

In the attic of a house
In the slats of light which creep across the room
In a forest grove at dawn
Where the animals sleep hidden in the gloom 

On the 97th floor overlooking Tokyo
In Camden road in a second floor flat with Dilworth down below
There is only one thing
There is only one thing 

In a cancer ward where the patients sit
Waiting patiently to die
In an aeroplane high above the place
You finally left behind 

In a cage where only one thing could be free
And it's not you and I
In a cage where only one thing could be free
And it's not you and I 

In every single place that has ever ever been
Hiroshima, Los Angeles and each town in between
There is only one thing
There is only one thing
One thing 

In the darkest part of you that you have ever seen
In the smile of the child staring at the TV screen
In the diary of a priest, in the sheets that lie upon his bed
Out there amongst the waves and inside your lover's head 

There is only one thing
There is only one thing
There is only one thing
There is only one thing 

20 years asleep before we sleep... forever
20 years asleep before we sleep... forever
