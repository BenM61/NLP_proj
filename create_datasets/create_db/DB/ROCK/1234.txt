One, two, three, four
Tell me that you love me more
Sleepless long nights
That is what my youth was for

Old teenage hopes are alive at your door
Left you with nothing but they want some more

Oh, uh oh, you're changing your heart
Oh, uh oh, you know who you are

Sweetheart, bitter heart now I can tell you apart
Cozy and cold, put the horse before the cart

Those teenage hopes who have tears in their eyes
Too scared to own up to one little lie

Oh, uh oh, you're changing your heart
Oh, uh oh, you know who you are

One, two, three, four, five, six, nine, or ten
Money can't buy you back the love that you had then
One, two, three, four, five, six, nine, or ten
Money can't buy you back the love that you had then

Oh, uh oh, you're changing your heart
Oh, uh oh, you know who you are
Oh, uh oh, you're changing your heart
Oh, uh oh, you know who you are
Who you are, who you are

For the teenage boys
They're breaking your heart
For the teenage boys
They're breaking your heart
