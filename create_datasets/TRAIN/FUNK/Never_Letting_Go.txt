Hi, I thought I'd drop by, so nice to see you
It's been too long since I was holding you
I've been holding on to a prayer
'Cause my dreams never seem to come true

I'm never letting go, never letting go, never letting go
It's not that easy
I'm never letting go, never letting go, never letting go
I'm crazy about you
But I can't live without you

I left the kitchen light on these past three nights
It don't know why, just keep shining bright
And now your eyes, the dance away from mine
Is it someone else again this time?

I'm never letting go, never letting go, never letting go
It's not that easy
I'm never letting go, never letting go, never letting go
I'm crazy about you, yeah

I could be a lady and walk away with style
But I fight to keep you, throw my arms around you
This is crazy I know but I just got the show

Never letting go, never letting go, never letting go
Never letting go
Never letting go, never letting go, never letting go
Never letting go
Never letting go, never letting go, never letting go
I'm crazy about you
Never letting go, never letting go, never letting go
I'm crazy about you, yeah
