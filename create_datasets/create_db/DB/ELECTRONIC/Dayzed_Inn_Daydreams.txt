I died unknown
Stillborn, one morning
Letters on paper
They remain
At least my work is done
The picture's gone
But the memory lingers on
Farewell
This one's for you

I used to dream
Dream away
Hide in the dark
Fade into gray
I used to pray
But now I scream
Lord help me
No more daydreams

I used to dream
Dream Away
Hide in the dark
Fade into gray

Too young to fall
I heard the call
Letters on paper
Thrown away
The story ends untold
My will survives
In a thousand future lives
And with that
I bid adieu

I used to dream
Dream away
Hide in the dark
Fade into gray
I used to pray
But now I scream
Lord help me
No more daydreams

I used to dream
Dream away
Hide in the dark
Fade into gray
