The mongrel cat came home
Holding half a head
Proceeded to show it off
To all his new found friends
He said "I've been where I like"
"I've slept with who I liked"
"She ate me up for breakfast"
"She screwed me in a vice"

"But now
I don't know why I
Feel so tongue-tied"

I sat in the cupboard
And wrote it down in neat
They were cheering and waving
Cheering and waving
Twitching and a-salivating like with myxomatosis
But it got edited fucked up
Strangled beaten up
Used in a photo in Time magazine
Buried in a burning black hole in Devon

I don't know why I
Feel so tongue-tied
Don't know why
I feel
So skinned alive.

Like my thoughts are misguided and a little naive
I twitch and I salivate like with myxomatosis
You should put me in a home or you should put me down
I got myxomatosis
I got myxomatosis

Yeah no one likes a smartarse but we all like stars
That wasn't my intention (tension), I did it for a reason (treason)
It must have got mixed up
Strangled beaten up
I got myxomatosis
I got myxomatosis

I don't know why I
Feel so tongue-tied
