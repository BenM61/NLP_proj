Oh
Open her eyes
Cause her to fall in love with me
Help me to speak
Bless me with words she will feel
Oh let it rain
Droplets of sunshine in her life
Give her the world
But let it be me she longs to hold

I can't wait, I won't wait 'cause tomorrow's too late
And I need her right now in my life

All that I'm praying for
Is my voice finds her like a lullaby
Sings her to sleep
She'll wake with me
Oh yeah

Rewind the days
To when she first laid eyes on me
Ignite the fire
Let in burn uncontrollably
Oh I'm in love
I've never felt this way before
Make her feel the same
And I will ask of you no more

I can't wait, I won't wait 'cause tomorrow's too late
And I need her right now in my life

All that I'm praying for
Is my love finds her like a lullaby
Finds her in the night
Sings her to sleep
All that I'm hoping for
Is my voice finds her like a lullaby
Sings her to sleep
She'll wake with me

This is my prayer
I've no shame to declare
That I waited for her (please wait with me)
Made out a love song
Made up this melody
Oh let this lullaby cry out and catch her oh

All that I'm praying for
Is my love finds her like a lullaby
Finds her in the night
Sings her to sleep
All that I'm hoping for
Is my voice finds her like a lullaby
Sings her to sleep
She'll wake with me [Repeat x3]

She's all I want
She'll wake with me
