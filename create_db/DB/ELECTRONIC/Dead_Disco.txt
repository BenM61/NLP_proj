Skip town. slow down 
Push it to the east coast
Step down turn around 
Push it to the west
Need less, use less 
We're asking for too much I guess
Cause all we get is

Dead disco 
Dead funk 
Dead rock and roll
Remodel 
Everything has been done

Tits out, pants down
Overnight to London
Touch down, look around
Everyone's the same
World wide, air tight
No one's got a face left to blame
And all we get is

Dead disco 
Dead funk 
Dead rock and roll
Remodel 
Everything has been done

Dead disco 
Dead funk 
Dead rock and roll
Remodel 
Everything has been done

I know, I know you tried to change things
I know you tried to change
