Guilty heart, you've had your fling at love,
Now it's time to feel the sting of love.
You were wrong right the very start, 
You were wrong, my guilty heart.

Love's a game i only meant to play
How could I have known you'd give yourself away
Heart to a heart and so I lost the game,
Guilty heart, you are to blame.

Guilty heart you always give so much
All the time you want to share so much
There's one thing I must confess to you,
Guilty heart, I'm guilty too
It's true my heart,
I'm guilty too.
