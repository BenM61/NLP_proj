I just want you to know
That I really, really think you're something special
Wanna try hard to show
Make it sweet, sweet, sweet wherever we go

Just to know love is true
Heaven blessed truth in you
I just want to be with you

Just to have you baby, by my side
Love would be the only rule
You're gonna see, baby, how hard I can try
None will ever do so well
Like a load of farming, fairy tale

Oh no, baby, baby

I just want you to know
When I first saw you, baby, I fell to the floor
Dreaming you in my head
Understanding love with nothing you can say

I need you baby, you know I do
Taking every part of you
Want to be with you
Love the way you tell my friends you're true
Want to be with you

I just want to be with you
I just want to be with you
I just want to be with you
I just want to be with you

I just want to be with you
I just want to be with you
I just want to be with you
