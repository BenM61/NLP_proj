Gilbert O'sullivan - Happiness Is Me And You

When the evening is over
Put your head upon my shoulder
And I'll tell you something
I believe is true
Happiness is me and you

In a world so distorted
Where the worst is best reported
Love maybe something
That will see us through
Happiness is me and you

There maybe girls that I'll remember
That made me happy for a while
But none of them compare with you my love
However hard they they all may try

If the bus that we're taking
Has for ages kept us waiting
What does it matter
Even in a queue
Happiness is me and you

There may be days when you discover
I'm not the man you think I am
But through it all we will recover
Without the aid of any plan

When the weeks turn to hours
And in June it's April showers
I'll tell you something I believe is true
Happiness is me and you
Happiness is me and you
Happiness is me and you
