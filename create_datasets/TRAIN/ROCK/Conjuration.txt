An almost dark vault
There meet the maniacs
Burning flickering candles
Smell of blood and death
Please the favour of the black
Earthery joys at midnight
In the horror creep and crawl
No one knows what's wrong or right

Terror comes as an invasion
And the pain pulls you down
Conjuration

The ceremony can begin
Last super to the evil
Crowned with thorns black rose
Crucified to the rites of fall
Tarred and feathered
Black holy relics offered
The ram in priestly form
Says the mass in black and blood

Terror comes as an invasion
And the pain pulls you down
Conjuration

Blasphemy of the sacrament
To the glory of the dark
Virgin dance and chanting
Wear the burning mark
The rising of the corpse begins
Through prayer oath and howl
They rip to pieces what doesn't fly
They strike with naked fist

Terror comes as an invasion
And the pain pulls you down
Conjuration

Terror comes as an invasion
And the pain pulls you down
Conjuration
