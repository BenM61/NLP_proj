The-the-the music played from the street cafes
All the people were passing in a distant haze
When you walked by
And I'm-a lonely and need someone to talk to

I sa-said ";Hello girl
Would you walk with me
I got-a nowhere to go
And I'd-a much rather be
Taking a chance that you had more than a fancy way about you";

So tell me girl
Where will it end, rescue me
The music you send
I'll play in the end, rescue me

The-the-the way you smiled was like a rising sun
You set a burning inside from which I should have run
But you walked by
And I was lonely and need someone to talk to

You-you-you blew my mind just like a neutron bomb
You left a shell outside where I could never come from
Now you walk by
You say you're lonely and need someone to talk to

So tell me girl
Where will it end, rescue me
'Cause the music you send
I'll play in the end, rescue me

I sh-sh-should respect your point of view
But what can I say when I'm in love with you
When nothing makes sense
I'm gonna take one more chance that you can love too

So tell me girl
When will it end, rescue me
'Cause the music you send
I'll play in the end, rescue me

The-the-the-the-the-the-the music played from the street cafes
Mmmmm...rescue me

Rescue me
Rescue me
