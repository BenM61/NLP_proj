Sometimes, what may be the best thing for you to do
Sometimes it the hardest thing for you to do
And that's real
'Cause I know that I love you
I know how I feel about you
But I also know that I don't make everything alright
And for that reason
I gotta say goodbye

Tell me have you ever been in a
Situation where the best thing you could do
was the hardest thing you've ever done
But you try to do whats right
And I know that deep down inside
That I really wanna be there by your side
But I can't stand to see you cry
Not when it's because of me

And it's over, I'll never love another
I'm always thinking of her, I'm doing this because of her

Don't wanna say goodbye
I don't wanna let her see me cry
Looking out the window and wondering why
Did we have to say all those things that we said last night
Baby I don't wanna say goodbye
So I'm just standing here wondering why
Just don't like to see when you cry
So I'ma say goodbye

If you think I 'cause I packed your stuff
That inside I ain't really really cracking up
'Cause you're wrong, I just hide it good
'Cause I know that's what you need
And there's more to life than loving yourself
You gotta learn to love somebody else
And that's why I do the things that I do

And its over, I'll never love another
I'm always thinking of her, I'm doing this because of her

Don't wanna say goodbye
I don't wanna let her see me cry
Looking out the window and wondering why
Did we have to say all those things that we said last night
Baby I don't wanna say goodbye
So I'm standing here wondering why
Just don't wanna see when you cry
So I'ma say goodbye

There's no one in this world that can ever take your place
All the love that we share, it can never be erased
And I know that, that it hurts so bad
And it's so that, that you're the best I've had

There's no one in this world that can ever take your place
All the love that we share, it can never be erased
And I know that, that it hurts so bad
And it's so that, that you're the best I've had

There's no one in this world that can ever take your place
All the love that we share, it can never be erased
And I know that, that it hurts so bad
And it's so that, that you're the best I've had

There's no one in this world that can ever take your place
All the love that we share, it can never be erased
And I know that, that it hurts so bad
And it's so that, that you're the best I've had
