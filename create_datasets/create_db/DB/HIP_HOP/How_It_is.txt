Look into the yes of a madman
You can see it in his face, he's a weak and sad man
Staring straight ahead, his eyes set like stone
With a nine millimeter cocked at your dome
No way out, it's too late 'cause you're already in it
So what'cha gonna do you'll be dead in a minute
Thinking slow will get you nowhere fast
A young life terminated with one short blast
You live like that, you die like this
That's how it is
Livin' with regret is no way to live
That's how it is
You're dead too soon if the bullet don't miss
That's how it is kid
How it is
That's what you get for
Living like this
With a bullet in your head, you're dead, you can't miss
Ain't no time for regret when you're body is in a bag
Ain't no time to change your mind when your head begins to sag
Should've known better, ain't working for you now
Maybe if you'd know better you'd be here somehow
So change your ways before you ways change you
With a hole in your head that you can see through
You're looking up and you're looking down
Shot's are rippin' out from all around
You're crying out for help but it can't be found
The voice of regret is the only sound
You play the game and you pay the price
For hustlin' in the gutter with the motherfuckin' street lice
You're runnin' and gunnin' and whatever else goes
And you're goin' with your crew whichever way the wind blows
"Cause you got their back and they got yours
And you live for yourself and you make your own laws
But sooner or later what goes around comes around
You wind up dead and buried in hard, cold ground
