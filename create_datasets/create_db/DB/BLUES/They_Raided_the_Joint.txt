They raided the joint, took everybody down but me
Yes they raided the joint, took everybody down but me
I was over in the corner just as high as I could be

Now some were playing blackjack, some were playing skin
I had plenty money but they wouldn't let me in
Yes they raided the joint, took everybody down but me
I was over in the corner just as high as I could be

They treated me like a stranger, like a dirty dog
Ate up all the chops, gave me the tail of the hog
Then they raided the joint, took everybody down but me
I was over in the corner just as high as I could be

Now they were drinking gin, drinking mighty fast
They offered me some King Kong [?], but I couldn't find a glass
They raided the joint, took everybody down but me
I was over in the corner just as high as I could be

Now some were drinking whiskey, some were drinking rhum
They had some sneaky peep but they wouldn't give me none
Yes they raided the joint, took everybody down but me
I was over in the corner, knocked out as I could be

Now gee it sure was funny, the best I ever saw
They heard somebody knocking and in walked the law
They raided the joint, took everybody down but me
I was over in the corner just as high as I could be

Now they were dancing in the kitchen, boogin' in the hall
Boy down the cordon tell the judge about it all
They raided the joint, took everybody down but me
I was over in the corner, high as I could be
