You've got a secret lover, you can't take home
You've got an ache deep down in your love bone
Come on check in, in a hurry
Under cover there's no need to worry

Stay all night if you got the time
Or just one hour is fine, ooh, so fine
Look in the mirror above your bed, yeah
Start to wonder if you're bein' mislead

Boogie Motel, Boogie Motel
May be sleazy, but it's cheap and it's easy

Between heaven and hell, check in to the Boogie Motel

Desk clerk's heart beats like a hammer
Got a smile like a beat-up piano
Gives a nudge and a wink as you sign in
I got a room you can have a good time in

What you want you can get for a price
Room service, send me something nice, so nice
Low down and nasty, ain't no Savoy
Bound to find something you can enjoy

Boogie Motel, Boogie Motel
May be sleazy, but it's cheap and it's easy

Between heaven and hell, check in to the Boogie Motel

Red lights, blue movies, sweet music, close to business and home
Get on the highway, if you want to use it, can't make it alone

Boogie Motel, Boogie Motel
May be sleazy, but it's cheap and it's easy

Between heaven and hell, yeah, you never can tell, no
May be glad you checked in to the Boogie Motel
