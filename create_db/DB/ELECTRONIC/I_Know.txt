I know
I know

I know
I have something for your minds, oh
Flyin' home
White eyes, my little time zone

You can take a stand
When you wanna make it right
Constantly mistaken that I can't say why enough
Chasing after something that I can leave behind
Never stop my dreaming' but she looks like a go-getter

I see what's on her mind (I know)
I see it all the time (I know)

Belong, heartstrung
And I understand I'm wrong
Finding tones, eyes closed
What if everybody won?

I'll take your hands and you can take my mind
Separately created but I know we can do better
Oh, oh
Slipping onto something that I can redefine
Feeling more creative but I can't stay high enough
Oh, oh
Yeah

I know what's on your mind (I know)
I think I got her high (I know)
