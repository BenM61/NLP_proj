I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pourin' rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I want to feel you in my arms again
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm with your love then you softly leave
And its me you need to show
How deep is your love

How deep is your love
How deep is your love
I really need to learn 
'Cus we're livin' in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

I believe in you
You know the dawn to a better sun
You're the light in my deepest, darkest doubt
You're my savior when I fall
And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And its me you need to show
How deep is your love

How deep is your love
How deep is your love
I really need to learn 
'Cus we're livin' in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

Girl you came to me on a summer breeze
Kept me warm in love then you softly leave
And its me you need to show
How deep is your love

How deep is your love
How deep is your love
I really need to learn 
'Cus we're livin' in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

I believe in you
How deep is your love
