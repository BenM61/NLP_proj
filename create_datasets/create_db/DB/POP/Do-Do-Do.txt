I remember the bliss
Of that wonderful kiss.
I knew that a boy
Could never have more joy
From any little miss.

I remember it quite,
'Twas a wonderful night.

Oh, how I'd adore it
If you would encore it.
0h

Do, do, do
What you've done, done, done
Before, Baby.
Do, do, do
What I do, do, do
Adore, Baby.
Let's try again,
Sigh again,
Fly again to heaven.
Baby, see
It's A, B, C,
I love you and you love me.
I know, know, know
What a beau, beau, beau
Should do, Baby;

So don't, don't, don't
Say it won't, won't, won't

Come true, baby,
My heart begins to hum,

So do, do, do
What you've done, done, done
Before.

Sweets we've tasted before
Cannot stand an encore.
You know that a miss
Who always gives a kiss
Would soon become a bore.

I can't see that at all,
True love never should pall.

I was only teasing;
What you did was pleasing.
Oh,

Do, do, do
What you've done, done, done
Before, Baby.
Do, do, do
What I do, do, do
Adore, baby.
Let's try again,
Sigh again,
Fly again to heaven.
Baby, see
It's ABC
I love you and you love me.

You dear, dear, dear
Little dear, dear, dear
Come here, snappy!
And see, see, see
Little me, me, me
Make you happy.

My heart begins to sigh

So do, do, do
What you've done, done, done
Before.
