There was a time I was down, down
I didn't know what to do
I was just stumbling around, around
Thinking things could not improve
I couldn't look on the bright side
Of anything at all
That's when you gave me a call

Now I feel better, better, better than before
I feel better, better, better, now I'm not down any more

And there were times I was sure, so sure
I couldn't turn it around
I couldn't care any more
About the good things I found
That's when you gave me a reason
To make me smile again
I only have to see you and then

I feel better, better, better than before
I feel better, better, better, now I'm not down any more
I feel better, better, better than before
I feel better, better, better, now I'm not down any more

Life sometimes seems to get the best of you
Like everything just brings you down
Just when you think there's nothing you can do
A friendly face will bring you around
And you'll feel better

You'll feel better, you'll feel better,
Better than before
You'll feel better, much better
No you won't get down any more
