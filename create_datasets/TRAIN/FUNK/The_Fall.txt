Make love to me
One more time
Before you go away
Why can't you stay?

Uh, my love
Come home to me
Just for a while
I'll leave this
Why can't you stay?

Don't run away
Don't slip away my dear
Don't run away, don't slip away my dear
Don't run away
The song is gone
The fell into the fall
But I don't want it this way
Why can't you stay
Don't run away, don't slip away my dear
Don't run away, don't slip away my dear
Don't run away
Ohh ohh

That should be worse
That should be worse that exlain away
But I'll talk time and twisted

Don't run away, don't slip away my dear
