You, you're living your life when you're dreaming
Late at night you're hearing my voice in your head, yeah
But you can't silence your own heavy breathing, ha
When you try, you wake up alone in your bed

It's time you see what it's all about
There's one cure and there's no way out

I don't wanna hear you might
There's a fire gettin' near and sparks ignite
If you're ready for a wild ride
Let me hear you say yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Say yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)

I, I feel all the heat when you see me
And I know, I know that you're feeling it too, ooh yeah
Letting go is something that should be so easy
Hold me close, I know what you want me to do

Your friends are telling you you're better alone
But you'll regret it when you get back home

I don't wanna hear you might
There's a fire gettin' near and sparks ignite
If you're ready for a wild ride
Let me hear you say yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Say yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Who knows where we'll be in the morning
I know we're here tonight
Get uptight and it all gets so boring
It takes two to make you come alive
Take my hand, kiss your fears goodbye
There's something here that we can't deny

It's time you see what it's all about
There's one cure and there's no way out

Well, let me hear you say it
Well, I wanna hear you say it
Well, let me hear you say yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Say yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)

I don't wanna hear you might
There's a fire gettin' near and sparks ignite
If you're ready for a wild ride
Let me hear you say yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Say yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Say yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Let me hear you say yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
