Van and willie went out one night
Once they get out on the road
Well then everything is alright
Had to get away from the kids and the wives
Well they ran into some city boys that didn't walk just right
And the line was drawn for another showdown
Like they'd always seen it done
And when the lights came up on the little woods town
Ther was an old man bailing out a son

Going out for a night on the town
Going out to the smoke and trees
Going out for a night on the town
Going out for a look and see
Said do what your daddy told you
Well i just went out and did that
Van and willie went out one night

There's a green table down at the midway
Where they rack up the balls for the games
And reputations are made
There's a green forest full of oaks and pines
Where they cleared a cleared a space in the middle
Where secret scores are settled
And the claim was made round the table that night
And they rode off through the trees
And the young boys tell how the city boys tried
And how one man fell to his knees

Going out for a night on the town
Going out to the smoke and trees
Going out for a night on the town
Going out for a look and see
Said what made you go and do that
Well we were just having a little fun
Van and willie went out one night

And the line was drawn for another showdown
Like they'd always seen and done
And one mans night for a drunken old time
Left a scar on on another one

Going out for a night on the town
Going out to the smoke and trees
Going out for a night on the town
Going out for a look and see
Said do what your daddy told you
Well i just went out and did that
Van and willie went out one night
