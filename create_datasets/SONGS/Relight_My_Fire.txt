Help me escape this feelin' of insecurity, ha ha
I need you so much but I don't really think you need me, ah ah
But if we all stand up in the name of love
And state the case of what we're dreamin' of
I got to say I only dream of you
But like a thief in the night
You took away the love that I knew

Oh ho ho ho
Relight my fire, your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love

Turn back the time to the days when our love was new
Do you remember?
No matter what was happenin', I was there with you
Ah ha
But if we all stand up for what we believe
And maybe live within our possibilities
The world would be wild for the dream
So baby don't turn away, listen to what I got to say

Oh ho ho ho ho
Relight my fire, your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love (I need your love)

Relight my fire (come on, yeah), your love is my only desire (I need your love)
Relight my fire, 'cause I need, I need your love

Yeah, you got to be strong enough to walk on through the night (yeah)
There's a new day on the other side (yeah)
Got to have hope in your soul
Just to keep on walkin' woah yeah
Strong enough to walk on through the night
There's a new day on the other side (on the other side)
And I got hope (hope) in my soul, I'll keep walkin' baby
Keep on walkin' baby

Relight my fire (relight my fire), your love is my only desire (only desire)
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love (I need your love)

Relight my fire (relight my fire), your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love (I need your love)

Relight me fire (relight my fire) relight my fire baby
Relight my fire (I need your love, yeah yeah)

Relight my fire (yeah yeah), your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love
