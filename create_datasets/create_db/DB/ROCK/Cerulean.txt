lue skies come down on me
White clouds are now in view,
it rained forty days you know
it rained fory nights you know
Blue skies came down on me.
Be careful what you say
You said that yesterday,
Tell me something new
It's always, always you
Blue skies come down on me
Gray clouds are far away,
I sought it for days on days
I sought it six weeks or so
But blue skies came down on me.
Be careful what you say
You said that yesterday,
Tell me something new
It's always ocean blue
Blue skies come down on me
White clouds are now in view
and you should see the view
and you should see the view
Blue skies
