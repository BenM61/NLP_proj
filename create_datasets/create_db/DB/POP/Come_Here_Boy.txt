It's dark in here
Visions are flashing into my head
As I reminisce
My reoccurring dreams and you said 

I'm falling, falling for you, babe,
And my feelings are gettin' stronger, 
So why don't you stay with me for a
For a, for a little longer 

[Chorus]
Come here, boy
Oh, come here, boy yeah
Come here, boy
Oh, come here, boy 

I know that my face 
Is only too familiar to your sleep
I can see it in your eyes
And I can tell by your body heat 

Why are you taking so long? 
You need to come and find me, honey
To set your mind at rest
And let your dreams run free

[Chorus: x2]

You know, I'm no stranger in your dreams 
You know, I'm not stranger in your dreams
Oh and I'm craving, I'm howling, 
I'm begging and pleading
Be mine tonight 

Oh and I'm waiting, I'm dying, 
I'm wanting and I'm needing
To show you this night 

Where I'll be touching and holding 
Caressing and giving you
Your every fantasy, yeah
I'll get you dreaming and lusting 
I'm Burning and praying
For more of this ecstasy

[Chorus: x2]

You know,
You know,
I'm no stranger in your dreams.
