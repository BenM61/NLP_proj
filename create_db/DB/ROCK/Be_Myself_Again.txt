I feel so way by down and out
And I know that soon my time is running out
I've been so high and I've been so low
And all the time I've was movin' too slow
But I guess that time takes a friend
To be yourself again
To be myself again 
To be myself again
To be myself again

I don't need your books to know how to read
While this mind of mine is just filled up with speed
You told me this now you're telling me that
Well, did I ever tell you how to act
'Cause you know it's time, time to pretend to
To be yourself again
And I'll be myself again 
Be myself again
Be myself again
Again
