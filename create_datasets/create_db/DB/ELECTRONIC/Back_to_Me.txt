I've been looking at you with a little something
That you've been ignoring
You've been looking at me with
I don't know what exactly, but it's boring
Play it cool, but I see through it
You should listen to the music
Boy, I know you want it so you better get up on it
Or you'll lose it, lose it, lose it

Mind if I slow you down?
No reply, you'll come round

Love to watch you try and turn your back to me
When I know that any minute you'll be back to me
Back, back, back to me
Back, back, back, back, back, back, back to me
Love to watch you try and turn your back to me
When I know that any minute you'll be back to me
Back, back, back to me
Back, back, back, back, back, back, back to me

Baby, could you shut up?
'Cause I don't need you to come up with excuses
I just need your eyes on me
So I can see you watching me move it, move it, move it
So soft and cryptic
Oh, while you listen to the music
Boy I know you want it so you better get up on it
Or you'll lose it, I'll prove it

Mind if I take you down?
Get you high, am I allowed?

Love to watch you try to turn your back to me
When I know that any minute you'll be back to me
Back, back, back to me
Back, back, back, back, back, back, back to me
Love and watch you try to turn your back to me
When I know that any minute you'll be back to me
Back, back, back to me
Back, back, back, back, back, back, back to me

Know that any, know that any, know that any, know that any
Know that any minute you'll be back to me
Love to watch you talk, love to watch you talk
Feel me, feel me, feel me
Back, back, back, back, back, ba-ba-ba-ba
While you listen, while you listen
While you, while you listen to the music
While you listen, while you listen
While you, while you listen to the music

Love to watch you try and turn your back to me
When I know that any minute you'll be back to me
Back, back, back to me
Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back
Love to watch you try to turn your back to me
When I know that any minute you'll be back to me
Back, back, back to me
Back, back, back, back, back, back, back to me
