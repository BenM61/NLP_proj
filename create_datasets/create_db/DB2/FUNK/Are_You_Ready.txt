Hey hey hey

Julie says that I must wake up
I am losing touch 'cause I think too much
I'm afraid to feel, my life feels unreal
You will not find love if you think you're not good enough

Are you ready to rebel
Change your mind, I know you live in hell
Are you ready, oh

All of my beliefs, they come back to me
I think life is tough, so my life is tough
She says find a way to develop love
To receive my love, believe you are good enough

Are you ready to rebel
Change your mind, I know you live in hell,
Are you ready

When we forget why we're here
Out goes love, in comes fear
And if not then, I'm all alone
I need nothing 'til my mind takes hold
Hold, hold

Are you ready to rebel
Are you ready
