Swimming in the deep blue
Living out of reach
Staring at the mirror
She's looking back at me
My words ringing around me
Playing on repeat
Playing on repeat
The one I see inside me
I wasn't meant to be

Lost
All because of me
I'm lost
I'm drowning

This new skin
Weighs half my heart
Tearing me apart
Wanna feel my heart
This new skin
Weighs half my heart
Mybe to the start
Can I feel my heart

Lonely as the blue sky
Higher than the clouds
Thinking I was better
'Til I fell down to the ground
Couldn't taste the phantom
From the words I speak
I wouldn't be so toxic
I never been so weak

Lost
All because of me
I'm lost
I'm drowning

This new skin
Weighs half my heart
Tearing me apart
Can I feel my heart
This new skin
Weighs half my heart
Maybe to the start
Can I feel my heart
This new skin
Weighs half my heart
Tearing me apart
Can I feel my heart
This new skin
Weighs half my heart
Maybe to the start
Can I feel my heart

Looking in the mirror
Whose the face I see?
