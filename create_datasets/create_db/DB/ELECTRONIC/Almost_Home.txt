I'll decide
In a moment's time
To turn away
Leave it all behind

So we climb
So we're all are told the line
The crowd is home
The treasure found

So let it go
Wake up, wake up, wake up
We're almost home
So let it go
Wake up, wake up, wake up
We're almost home

Time to scout
When I was a child there
I know at heart
To be at your side

So we climb
Somewhere I will draw the line
I dream it, too
The stars were mine

So let it go
Wake up, wake up, wake up
We're almost home
So let it go
Wake up, wake up, wake up
We're almost home

I'll decide
In a moment's time
To turn away
Leave it all behind

So we climb
Somewhere I will draw the line
The crowd is home
The treasure found

So let it go
Wake up, wake up, wake up
We're almost home
So let it go
Wake up, wake up, wake up
We're almost home
So let it go
Wake up, wake up, wake up
We're almost home
So let it go
Wake up, wake up, wake up
We're almost home
