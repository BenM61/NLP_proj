I'm not a boy,
I'm a big, fat balloon
Flapping in the wind
Floating over the treetops
On a broken string
I've never been tied down
To anything

Because I'm free
I suppose
I can go
Where I want to go

I drift carelessly
On a summer breeze
I bounce above the trees
I try to be cheerful
But I can feel myself
Deflating all the time
Up in the sky.

Because I'm a balloon
On a broken string
I'm not attached to
Anyone or anything
Anymore
Oh-oh-oh
Schooby-doo
Tra-la-la

I'm sad and alone
But you'd never know
It to look at me
I look ever so happy
Up here by myself
But I wish sometimes I looked
The way I felt

Because I'm a balloon
On a broken string
I'm don't belong to
Anyone or anything
Anymore
Anymore

I'm a balloon
On a broken string
I'm not attached
To anyone or anything

I'm a balloon
On a broken string
I don't belong to
Anyone or anything

And I know I look shiny and bouncy
But I'm all empty inside
And I worry that if I was to just burst suddenly
That nobody would even notice me

I know I look shiny and bouncy
But I'm all empty inside
And I worry that if I was to just burst suddenly
That nobody would even notice me
