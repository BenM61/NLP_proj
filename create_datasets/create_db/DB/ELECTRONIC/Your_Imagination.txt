I remember when I used to be the jealous kind
I got over it, now you're taking over my old line

You're caring too much about what I say
You're wondering too much about what I do
And baby, your imagination now
Imagination's got the best of you

I ain't doin' nothing that you could really say was wrong, wrong
Just one oversight and know that didn't last too long

You're caring too much about what I say
You're wondering too much about what I do
Baby, your imagination now
Imagination's got the best of you

I know what you're looking for
What's this thing about "true blue", oh yeah 
You know I ain't no danger boy
'Cause you're the one I like to touch, touch you, you, you, you

Yeah, when the mood is right, change the light and the moment's gone
You better turn around, 'cause the light doesn't last too long

You see, you're caring too much about what I say
And wondering too much about what I do
And baby, your imagination now
Imagination's got the best of you

Your imagination (your imagination)
Your imagination (your imagination)
Oh baby your imagination (your imagination)
Baby your imagination (your imagination)
Baby baby your imagination (your imagination)
Baby your imagination (your imagination)
Baby baby your imagination (your imagination)
Baby baby your imagination (your imagination)
Oh your imagination, use your imagination
