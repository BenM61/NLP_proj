Anastasia, tell me who you are
Are you someone from another star?
Anastasia, are you what you seem?
Do your sad eyes remember a dream?
Why do you tremble? And why do you sigh?
Could you be lonely, as lonely as I?
Do you remember when summer has flown
Another world, a world that is yours alone?
Anastasia, smile away the past
Anastasia, spring is here at last
Beautiful stranger step down from your star
I only know I love you so
Whoever you are
