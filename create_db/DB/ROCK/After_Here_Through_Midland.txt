Thought my days here were given up for forgotten 
Can't burn cedar, it must come out by the roots 
I'm not driving, but I'm taking bets 
Six full hours and we ain't crossed it yet 
One more stop after here through Midland I know 
One more stop after here through Midland I know 
Till I come to rest

Turn back now and I might as well read my fortune 
And lose this vengeance long since been overdue 
Half-awake there is not much left 
Walk my dollar across to Juarez 
One more stop after here through Midland I know 
One more stop after here through Midland I know 
Till I come to rest 

I left some worn-out dreams hanging on a wire 
The city that's my passage to the west 
Is just over the rise
