I don't like feelin'
Mixed up in the city
Showdown
Slow down
You're not foolin' me
You live your life, I'll live mine
Underground

Body talk
I see your body talk
You make my body talk
When you're next to me

Body talk
I know your body talk
You make my body talk
When you're next to me

I can't stop seein'
Streetlights on me
Hot nights, hold tight
You're not foolin' me
Let me get right to the point
Spend a little time with me

Body talk
I see your body talk
You make my body talk
When you're next to me

Body talk
I know your body talk
You make my body talk
When you're next to me

Let it out
You don't know what you're missing
Have no doubt
I'm takin' what you're givin'

Make no mistake
Let's make it clear
You're speaking a language that's easy to hear

I don't like feelin'
Mixed up in the city
Showdown
Slow down
You're not foolin' me
You live your life, I'll live mine
Underground

Body talk
I see your body talk
You make my body talk
When you're next to me

Body talk
I know your body talk
You make my body talk
When you're next to me

Body talk
Body talk
Body talk
(Body talk)
(Body talk)
(Body talk)
