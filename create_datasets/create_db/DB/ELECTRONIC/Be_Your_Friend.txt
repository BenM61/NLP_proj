I recall when
We were young and
Never cared 'bout a thing, whoa
We were fire, perfect liars
We were gone with the wind

Everybody wants to know what
Different really means
And everybody tries to be like us
But somethings they could never be

'Cause we will never turn our hearts away
You and I will be your friend
All my life
If I lose my way I'll be fine
'Cause you won't let me go
You won't let me go
You won't let me

Turn our hearts away
You and I will be your friend
All my life
If I lose my way
I'll be fine
'Cause you won't let me go
You won't let me go
You won't let me

'Cause you won't let me go
You won't let me go
You won't let me

Just like Coldplay, you will fix me
When I'm down at a low
No more guessing, where we fit in
'Cause we know where to go

Everybody wants to know what different really means
And everybody tries to be like us
But somethings they could never be

'Cause we will never turn our hearts away
You and I will be your friend
All my life
If I lose my way I'll be fine
'Cause you won't let me go
You won't let me go
You won't let me

Turn our hearts away
You and I will be your friend
All my life
If I lose my way
I'll be fine
'Cause you won't let me go
You won't let me go
You won't let me

You won't let me
You won't let me
'Cause you won't let me go
You won't let me go
You won't let me
