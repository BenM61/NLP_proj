White ladder
Water and wine
Forever
Crying oh time
Don't wanna
Feel tonight

There's no rhyme or reason to love
This sweet love

White river
Thunder and war
How many
Time, oh no
Don't wanna
Feel no more

There's no rhyme or reason to love
This sweet, sweet love

To the night another body
To the night another name
To the night another Valentine
Burning flame

To the night another body
To the night another name
To the night another Valentine
A burning flame

Total order
Tell 'em boy inside
Forever
Crying oh man, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't wanna
Feel tonight

There's no rhyme or reason to love
This sweet, sweet love

To the night another body
To the night another name
To the night another Valentine
Burning flame

To the night another body
To the night another name
To the night another Valentine
A burning flame

To the night another body
To the night another name
To the night another Valentine
Burning flame

White ladder
Water and wine
Don't wanna feel tonight
