The beauty's gone

My time wasn't enough (I'm spendin it all with you)
My heart wasn't enough (I'm givin' it to you)
My money wasn't enough (I'm givin' you all that)
My house wasn't enough (but you live in that)
And now you wanna leave

Wish I never told you "you should leave"
Wish me and you never had my seed
No I better stop it that's a lie
Cuz girl you were the apple of my eye
Took a little time for me to see
That girl I need you right here next to me
I done let you walk away
But I'm not goin out that way, no

Not that way
Not goin out that way
I can't live without you
Can't be without you
I'm beggin' you to stay, to stay

I love you
And even though I'm said that you could leave me
I wanted other chances to adore you
I still believe in you and me, I love you
Won't you take the time (Love you)
Take the time to see (Leave me)
I don't wanna have to live my life in misery
I wasn't ready for you to set me free (Adore you), (I'm in love)
Don't give our love away

Words can't describe how I feel about you
Only Heaven knows how much I do
Girl I'll put my own life on the line
I'd cherish and protect you with my life
All that shit I said girl I didn't mean
I'd die without your love baby if you leave
I could let you walk away
But baby I'm not goin out that way

Not that way
Not goin out that way
Cuz I can't live without you
Can't be without you
I'm beggin you to stay, oohhh

I love you
And even though I'm sayin you can leave me (I was just bullshittin baby)
I wanted other chances to adore you (I was just fuckin around)
Cuz I still believe in you and me, yeah
Won't you take the time (Love you) 
Take the time to see (Leave me) (take the time)
I don't wanna have to live my life in misery
I wasn't ready for you to set me free (Adore you) (I don't wanna live my life 
without you here

Might as well just kill me

All my life (all my, my life, I'd sacrifice for you)
Sacrifice (baby, I'd sacrifice for you, baby I'd sacrifice)
After that rising sun
Is another day begun
I won't live without you
Won't be without you
I'm beggin you to stay (Can't you just understand I just don't wanna be with 
you?)
Please stay

I love you
And even though I'm sayin you can leave me
I wanted other chances to adore you
(Gonna take my time, take my time, to give you the love that you want)
Won't you take the time (Love you) 
Take the time to see (Leave me) 
I don't wanna have to live my life in misery
I wasn't ready for you to set me free (Adore you)

Cuz I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you 
I love you, baby
And I still believe in you and me

(I love you)
oh, I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I do
Waitin for you
For you, baby
I love you

We need each other
I taught you how to love 
You taught me how to love
And from that we created love (I love you)
You stayed with me when I was doin' wrong
So why'd you leave me when I started doin right
The beauty's gone
I love you
I love you
