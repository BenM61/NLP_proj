I don't care if I never ever see you again
Well this times for real
You tell everybody what you think about me now
Well that's fine cause I don't have kind words for you now
I don't feel the love no more

Liar, your everything
I never wanted for me this is true
I don't really care if I never see you again
Stay out of my life

This pain I feel inside of me
It slowly fades away
Because now I'm fine
I live my life the way I want to live
Its great
There's no regrets or depression it's gone
You see you've made me be

Stronger!
Your everything I never wanted for me this is true
I don't really care if I never see you again
Stay out of my life

What do you think of me now?
Does it feel right?
Now the scars lie forever, but I know that the pain will soon leave me
This is my therapy
This song goes out to anyone who's ever had do go through this bullshit
This is your therapy

Liar
Your everything I never wanted for me this is true
I don't give a damn if I never see you again
Stay out of my life

This is my therapy
