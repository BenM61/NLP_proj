You seem sad, but you're telling lies
Getting lost in the shuffle of alibis
Seasons change, so do you, so do I
Where do I go?

Looking back on indiscretion
Love reaction, I want action

No, no, no
Trying hard not to let you go, oh so cold
'Cause you just never let it show
There you go wandering along, wandering along

People come and people go
Where do you go when you're not at home?
There is always more than meets the eye
Flew so fast, fell from the sky below

No, no, no
Trying hard not to let you go, oh so cold
'Cause you just never let it show
There you go wandering along, wandering along

I can read your face, you might have noticed
No, no, no
I can tangle with your mind
You never let it show

I can read your face, you might have noticed
No, no, no
I can tangle with your mind, with your mind

You seem sad but you're telling me lies
Getting lost in the shuffle of alibis

No, no, no
Trying hard not to let you go, oh so cold
'Cause you just never let it show
There you go wandering along, wandering along

I can read your face, you might have noticed
No, no, no
I can tangle with your mind
You never let it show

I can read your face, you might have noticed
No, no, no
I can tangle with your mind, with your mind
Oh, with your mind
