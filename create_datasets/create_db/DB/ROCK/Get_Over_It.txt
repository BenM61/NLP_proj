Lot of knots, lot of snags,
Lot of holes, lot of cracks, lot of crags.
Lot of naggin' old hags,
Lot of fools, lot of fool scum bags.
Oh, it's such a drag, what a chore,
Oh, your wounds are full of salt.
Everything's a stress and what's more,
Well, it's all somebody's fault.

Hey!
Get, get, get, get, get over it!
Hey!
Get, get, get, get, get over it!
Hey!
Get, get, get, get, get over it!
Get over it. Get over, it. Heyaa.
Ohhh

Make you sick, make you ill,
Makes you cheat, slipping change from the till.
Had it up to the gills,
Makes you cry,
While the milk still spills.
Ain't it just a bitch?
What a pain(pain)
Well, it's all a crying shame.
What left to do(to do)...but complain?
Better find someone to blame.

Hey!
Get, get, get, get, get over it!
Hey!
Get, get, get, get, get over it!
Hey!
Get, get, get, get, get over it!
Get over it. Get over, it. Heyaa.
Ohhh

Got a job, got a life,
Got a four-door and a faithless wife.
Got those nice copper pipes,
Got an ex, got a room for the night.
Aren't you such a catch?
What a prize(prize)...
Got a body like a battle axe.
Love that perfect frown, honest eyes
We ought to buy you a Cadillac.

Hey!
Get, get, get, get, get over it!
Hey!
Get, get, get, get, get over it!
Hey!
Get, get, get, get, get over it!
Hey!
Get, get, get, get, get over it!
Hey! (Get over it)
Get, get, get, get, get over it!
Hey! (Get over it)
Get, get, get, get, get over it!
Hey! (Get over it)
Get, get, get, get, get over it!
Get over it. Get over, it. Heyaa.
Ohhh
