Night time am a-fallin', everything is still
And the moon am a shinin' from above
Cupid am a callin' every Jack and Jill
It's just about the time for making love
Someone is a-waiting all along for me
No more hesitating, I must go and see
"How dee do, Dear, it's with you dear
That I love to be"

Put your arms around me, Honey, hold me tight
Huddle up and cuddle up with all your might
Oh! Oh! Won't you roll those eyes?
Eyes that I just idolize
When they look at me, my heart begins to float
Then it starts a rockin' like a motor boat
Oh! Oh! I never knew any girl like you

Music am a-playin' such a "Loving Glide"
That my feet keep a moving to and fro
And with you a-swayin', I'll be satisfied
To dance until we hear the roosters crow
I love seven 'leven, I love chicken too
Nearest thing to heaven is to be with you
For I'm spoony, moony, loony, but my love is true

Put Your Arms Around Me Honey, hold me tight
Huddle up and cuddle up with all your might
Oh! Oh! Won't you roll those eyes
Eyes that I just idolize
When they look at me, my heart begins to float
Then it starts a rockin' like a motorboat
Oh! Oh! I never knew any girl like you
