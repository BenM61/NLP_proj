Them crazy
Them crazy 
We gonna chase those crazy baldheads out of town
Chase those crazy baldheads out of our town

I'n'I build a cabin
I'n'I plant the corn
Didn't my people before me
Slave for this country?
Now you look me with that scorn
Then you eat up all my corn

We gonna chase those crazy 
Chase them crazy 
Chase those crazy baldheads out of town
 
Build your penitentiary, we build your schools
Brainwash education to make us the fools
Hate is your reward for our love
Telling us of your God above

We gonna chase those crazy 
Chase those crazy bunkheads 
Chase those crazy baldheads out of the town

Chase those crazy baldheads out of the town

We gonna chase those crazy 
Chase those crazy bunkheads 
Chase those crazy baldheads out of the town

Here comes the conman
Coming with his con plan
We won't take no bribe
We've got to stay alive

We gonna chase those crazy 
Chase those crazy baldheads 
Chase those crazy baldheads out of the town
