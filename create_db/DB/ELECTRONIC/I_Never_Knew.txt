It was a cold day in December 
I remember it so well 
You captured my whole being 
And you left me in a spell 

You warmed my heart with passion 
Desiring all of you 
You left me cold in the summer 
I wish that I only knew but- 
 
I never knew that you would be the one 
To come along and snatch my heart and run 
Away from me with no explanation why 
I never knew what we had would die 
All I wanna do is hide away 
From all the hurt and pain of yesterday 
Don't you see the tears, the hurt inside? 
I never knew, please tell me why 

All the nights you left me crying 
Keeping company with my fears 
That some day you'd leave me lonely 
And that's exactly what you did 
I swore that I was your baby 
The darkest night for you I'd bear 
Now that I need you here with me 
I call your name and you're not there 

You left me standing 
So empty-handed 
Out in the cold 
How was I to know 
That my love didn't matter 
And my world was shattered 
'Cause you left me here 
Drowning in tears, oh why? 

I never knew that you would be the one 
To come along and snatch my heart and run 
Away from me with no explanation why 
I never knew what we had would die 
All I wanna do is hide away 
From all the hurt and pain of yesterday 
Don't you see the tears, the hurt inside? 
I never knew, please tell me why 

After we made plans to spend our lives together 
I thought what we had was meant to be forever 
Oh why did our love have to go away? 
I don't know how, I don't know when 
But I know, I'll never love this way again 

I never knew that you would be the one 
To come along and snatch my heart and run 
Away from me with no explanation why 
I never knew what we had would die 
All I wanna do is hide away 
From all the hurt and pain of yesterday 
Don't you see the tears, the hurt inside? 
I never knew, please tell me why 

I never knew that you would be the one 
To come along and snatch my heart and run 
Away from me with no explanation why 
I never knew what we had would die 
All I wanna do is hide away 
From all the hurt and pain of yesterday 
Don't you see the tears, the hurt inside? 
I never knew, please tell me why 

I never knew, I never knew 
I never knew it could be like this 

I never knew, I never knew 
I never knew it could be like this
