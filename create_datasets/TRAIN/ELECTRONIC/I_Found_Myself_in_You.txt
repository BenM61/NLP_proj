(Ha-ahhh... ha-ahhh-ah... ha-ahhh-ah-ah-ahhh... ha-ahhh... ah-ahhh...)
In my heart of hearts
Lived a lonely soul
Searching for someone who could make me whole.
Then I found you
I found you

Like an endless thirst makes a desert dry
Tears of joy when I looked in your eyes. 
Had to find you
Had to find you.

You heal me
You feel me
Like a stranger, yet someone I once knew
I found myself in you.
You shield me
Reveal me
You're the other half of me
It's true, I found myself in you.

The breath of life that you breathe into me
Is a hunger craved for eternity
I am bound to you
I am bound to you.

You heal me
You feel me
Like a stranger, yet someone I once knew
I found myself in you.
You shield me (shield me)
Reveal me (reveal me)
You're the other half of me
It's true, I found myself in you

You show me laughter, you show me life... 
It's heaven on earth here with you tonight. 
No longer lost... 
Now I believe we've found...
A sacred, sacred ground. 

(Ooo-hoo-ooo...)
You heal me... (heal me)
You feel me... (you feel me)
Like a stranger, yet someone I once knew... 
I found myself in you.
You shield me... (shield me) 
Reveal me... (reveal me)
You're the other half of me... (you're the other half in me...)
It's true... 
I found myself in you... (I found myself in you)

You shield me... 
Reveal me... 
Like a stranger, yet someone I once knew... 
(You're the other half of me...)
I found myself in you...
(I found myself, I found myself in you)
You shield me... 
Reveal me...
Like the other half of me...
It's true... 
I found myself in you.
