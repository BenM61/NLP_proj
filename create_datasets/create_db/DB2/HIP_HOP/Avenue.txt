I hit the avenue
Go get the check
I'm about my revenue
Came to collect
I hit the avenue
To get the check
Running through avenues
To get this revenue
I hit the avenue
Go get the check
I'm about my revenue
Came to collect
I hit the avenue
To get the check
Running through avenues
To get this revenue

I hit the avenue to get the check
I hit the avenue so I can flex
I'm on that avenue
Each city I'm running through
Just know I'm coming through
The livest avenue
We coming like a 100 crews
Dirt bikes and foreign coupes
It's blue dot let go of the goose
I'm too hot to be labeled number 2
Ohhh
You
Must got your boy confused
Thinking I'll settle to be deuce
Hit the ave while y'all watch from the stoop

I hit the avenue
Go get the check
I'm about my revenue
Came to collect
I hit the avenue
To get the check
Running through avenues
To get this revenue
I hit the avenue
Go get the check
I'm about my revenue
Came to collect
I hit the avenue
To get the check
Running through avenues
To get this revenue

I hit the avenue to get the check
On every avenue I get respect
One of the very few, you won't forget
And there's no avenue I owe a debt
I'm on a different altitude
Damn near touching the moon
You out here running on fumes
I'm like a v12 and my tank full
Hit the road stack on my bank roll
Math wrong I turn to Rambo
Humble n***a but I am stunt doe
Got it all yea but I want more
More Life
I'm leaving you suckers behind
I want no ties
With n****s who ain't bout the grind
On my avenue we get the chips
Get to the bag and make it flip

I hit the avenue
Go get the check
I'm about my revenue
Came to collect
I hit the avenue
To get the check
Running through avenues
To get this revenue
I hit the avenue
Go get the check
I'm about my revenue
Came to collect
I hit the avenue
To get the check
Running through avenues
To get this revenue
