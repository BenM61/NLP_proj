Melancholy me
Melancholy over you
All alone and feelin' blue
Are you melancholy too?

Miss you every day
Ever since you went away
Melancholy over you
Are you melancholy too?

While each minute seems
Like hours to me
Each hour seems like years
Each day is an eternity
Of sadness and tears

All I do is yearn
Though I know you'll soon return
But until you do, I'll be
Just a melancholy me

While each minute seems
Like hours to me
Each hour seems like years
Each day is an eternity
Of sadness and tears

All I do is yearn
Though I know you'll soon return
But until you do, I'll be
Just a melancholy me
