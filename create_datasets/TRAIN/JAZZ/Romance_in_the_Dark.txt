Romance in the dark with you
All at once I knew
Darlin' love was near
I thrill to my finger tips
I could feel your lips
Darlin' oh so near
The music was so entrancing
The lights all began to fade
I said to myself keep dancing
But only my heart obeyed
A flame grew from just a spark
When I found romance in the dark with you
