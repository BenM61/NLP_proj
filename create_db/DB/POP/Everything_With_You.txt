Start off "sometimes..." now its our time
Are you with me?
Strange teenager, waiting for death at 19
Are you with me?

I'm with you and there's nothing left to do
Tell me its true
I'm with you and the stars are crashing through
I want everything with you

Now you're someone says you're no one
Are you with me?
Strange teenager, you'll never know
Death at 19
Are you with me?
