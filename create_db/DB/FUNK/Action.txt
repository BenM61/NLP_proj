It takes two
Point of view
Got no clue
Maybe let's pretend

Where you going
What you showing
Cash you blowing
Face you showing
Ticking, tocking
Weekend rocking
Fish in stocking
Electric shocking

Don't you, don't you do
Don't you, don't you do
When you see, a man doing his thing
Then see, he's got you
When you see a woman doing her thing, baby
Then you see she's on a hue, on a hue
She's on a clue, on a clue
Don't you, don't you do
Don't you, don't you do
Don't you, don't you do
Don't you, don't you do

In my side, in my mind, baby might you speak was right
Right? On an assy, got my posse
In my boat, and my goat
Going back in the woods, you're making mad in the woods
Got the city in the woods, getting lost in the woods
Working fine in a place
Show that right track in a place
Give my flash give me trick
Like a face in a race

Don't you, don't you do
Don't you, don't you do
Don't you, don't you do
Don't you, don't you do

When you see a man doing his thing
Then see, he's got his own
When you see another woman doing her thing
Always see she's on a hue, on a hue

Don't think, I'm a 70's baby
Don't think it could all be wrong
Don't you feel from the 1970's baby
All of them could be wrong

When you see a man on a street
Catcalling up to every she alone
When you see a man in the business baby
He never get called a bitch on his own
He never get called a bitch on his own

Don't you, don't you do
Don't you, don't you do
Don't you, don't you do
Don't you, don't you do

Damn with you all these too,in this too
Don't you wanna see a woman baby doing
Don't you want her on her own
Don't you hear the sound of an animal calling
Don't you, don't you do
Don't you, don't you do
Don't you, don't you do

(Start all over again)
Don't you, don't you do
Don't you, don't you do
Don't you, don't you do
Don't you, don't you do
Don't you, don't you do
Don't you, don't you do
Don't you, don't you do
Don't you, don't you do
Don't you, don't you do

It takes two
Point of view
Got no chew
Maybe lets pretend

I point you
All got dew
And it's you
Start all over again

In my side, in my mind, baby might you speak was right
Right?
