The streets are all violent
With murderous excitement
The hunter and the prey
Are dancing everyday

That waltzing gibberish
Where intake becomes outlandish
I'm in a bad way
Every passing day

"So where do we go from here", I'll say
You're a shining star, you'd do great in L.A.
And I keep fixing every habit that I break

Oh, Megan, is this thing of ours still on?
For I haven't slept a wink since you have been gone
Now I want to be buried in your backyard
And when the flowers grow just know you're still in my heart
You're still in my heart

A flash of dark interest
Steers us into this car crash
Uniting our remains, a fiery hurray
Ay ay ay

Our hands touch unnoticed
Pressed up against melting glass
You're calling out my name
As the air escapes

"Oh, where do we go from here", I'll say
You're a shining star, you'd do great in L.A.
And I keep fixing every habit that I break

Oh, Megan, is this thing of ours still on?
For I haven't slept a wink since you have been gone
Now I want to be buried in your backyard
And when the flowers grow just know you're still in my heart

"Where do we go from here", I'll say
You're a shining star, you'd do great in L.A.
And I keep fixing every habit that I break

Oh, Megan, is this thing of ours still on?
For I haven't slept a wink since you have been gone
Now I want to be buried in your backyard
And when the flowers grow just know you're still in my heart

When the flowers grow just know you're in my heart
When the flowers grow just know you're still in my heart
