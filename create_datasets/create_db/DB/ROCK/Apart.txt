You and I will never be apart, apart
And you will never hear it from my heart, my heart
The distance kept alive, the only hope I have in time
Now you do what you do, I'll do what I do, I can't stop dreaming of you

[Chorus]
I want you to be here, I want it to be love
I want you to be here, I want it to be love
I want you to be here, here, here, here, here, here
I want it to be love, love, love, love, love, love, love
I want you to be here, here, here, here, here, here
I want it to be love, love, love, love, love, love, love
I want it to be love

I remember the day that you walked away from me, from me
I hate to remember the day you walked away from me, from me
What you said to me the other day, was enough to make me feel okay
But I just want to reach in your heart, and I don't know how

[Chorus]

I want you to be here
I want it to be love
I want you to be here
I want it to be love

I want you to be here!

[Chorus]
