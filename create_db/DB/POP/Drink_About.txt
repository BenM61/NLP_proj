Now and then, I get a little too drunk
Say a little too much, I do
Now and then, I get a bit impatient
Too much information

I'm trying so hard not to give a f*ck
Bleeding out on the living room rug
But I'd pay a million bucks
To think about anybody else but you

Drink about anybody else but you
Talk about anybody else but you, you
Can't stop picturing my lips on you
No more waking up in your room
F*ck I want anybody else but you
I just wanna drink about, drink about
Anybody but you

No more waking up in your room
No more waking up in your room
F*ck I want anybody else but you
F*ck I want anybody else but you
No more waking up in your room
No more waking up in your room
F*ck I want anybody else but you
I just want anybody but you
No more waking up in your room
No more waking up in your room
F*ck I want anybody else but you
F*ck I want anybody else but you
No more waking up in your room
No more waking up in your room
F*ck I want anybody else but you
I just want anybody but you

Now and then, we go a little too hard
Get high in my front yard, we do
I bet beggars can't be choosers
Telling you the truth, you make it so damn hard to

Just not give a f*ck
Bleeding out on the living room rug
But I'd pay a million bucks
To think about anybody else but you

Drink about anybody else but you
Talk about anybody else but you, you
Can't stop picturing my lips on you
No more waking up in your room
F*ck I want anybody else but you
I just wanna drink about, drink about
Anybody but you

Drink about, drink about anybody but you
To drink about anybody but you
Oh oh oh 
Drink about anybody but you
I just wanna drink about, drink about
Anybody but you

No more waking up in your room
No more waking up in your room
F*ck I want anybody else but you
F*ck I want anybody else but you
No more waking up in your room
No more waking up in your room
F*ck I want anybody else but you
I just want anybody but you
No more waking up in your room
No more waking up in your room
F*ck I want anybody else but you
F*ck I want anybody else but you
No more waking up in your room
No more waking up in your room
F*ck I want anybody else but you
I just want anybody but you
