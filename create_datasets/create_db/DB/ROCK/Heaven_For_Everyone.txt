While you are imagining, imagine for instance,
The sights that you can take advantage of
Look at the beautiful cloud formations below you and above you
This could be heaven

Think of the colour of the sun as it shines off the clouds
In these days, in these days, in these days of cool reflection
You come to me and everything seems alright
In these days of cold affections

You sit by me and everything's fine
This could be heaven for everyone
This world could be fed, this world could be fun
This could be heaven for everyone

This world could be free, this world could be one,
In this world of cool deception
Just smile can smooth my ride
These troubled days of cruel rejection

You come to me, soothe my troubled mind
Yeah, this could be heaven for everyone
This world could be fed, this world could be one
We should bring love to our daughters and sons

Love, love, love, love
(This could be heaven for everyone)
So take a seat and sit by my side a while
You know I like your style

(This could be heaven for everyone)
So what can we do to clean up this mess
Just feel so helpless
This could be heaven for everyone

So lift up your voice at least you'll have cared
At least you'll have dared
Listen. What people do to other souls
They take their lives, destroy their goals

Their basic pride and dignity
Is stripped and torn and shown no pity
When this should be heaven for everyone

This could be heaven, could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven, could be heaven for everyone etc.
And this is the end of this section.
