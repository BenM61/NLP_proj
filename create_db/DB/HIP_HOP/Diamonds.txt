Diamonds in my damn chain! 
It ain't hard to tell!

[Chorus:]
(Diamonds in my damn chain)
(Diamonds in my damn chain)
I'm like, oh daddy, I see you do the damn thing
Got my vote, I'm feelin' ya campaign
I like you, but I really like your damn chain
(Diamonds in my damn chain)
(Diamonds in my damn chain)
It kinda explains the way she be actin'
She liked my necklace so she started relaxin'
Now, that's what the f*ck I call a chain reaction

[Fabolous]
Yo, you think they like me now, wait until the light hit me
I bet the house somebody's girl spend the night with me
They gotta love it, if not, then I guess they haters
This kinda necklace turn on the investigators
They ain't got one problem with this
Square face watch look like sponge bob on the wrist
One white, one gold, one nice, untold
You could look, but don't touch, guns might unload, now
I respect them thugs who get they jackin' on
But we squeeze to every slug that we be packin', son
Ya boy got the drug money we be stackin' on
Lotta carrots, not the one's Bugs Bunny snackin' on
Got 'em gettin' close, and lookin' like a scooped-up
The titanic chain from the bottom of the ocean
I play them diamonds well when I got that jewelery on
They should call me Carat Jeter, maybe Canary Bonds

[Chorus]

[Young Jeezy]
Oh, she actin' real reckless right now
Let me at this bitch, man, let's go
Damn, what happened? He blinded everybody
It must be Jeezy, outshinin' everybody
Yeah, I'm fretted for the show
You could call me the light man
(Diamonds in my damn chain)
You could call me the bright man
Yeah, I don't do bright links, I do AP's
Yeah, I spit cheese on all these VV's
Blow an old G, yeah, I got it from home
Twenty carat pinky ring, shit, I got it robbin'
(Break yourself, nigga) We have to step it up a notch
Iced-out ski-mask, placed in the projects to hide my weed stash
Dominican shit, shit, I got it from fans
Yo, the stone is in my chain, so I call it the cab

[Chorus]

[Fabolous]
Yo, maybe it's them VV's 'cause they sets susters
Sit on the next bus like the show on MTV
The wings on the chain make a nigga fly
Like the wings on a plane when you sittin' in between 'em
They hittin' when you clean 'em, glitterin' when you seen 'em
Beemin' through the tints when I'm sittin' in the "Phenom"
Oops, I mean Phantom; my words got tangled, man
But this tiger stripe watch make this bitch a Bengals fan
We all know Jacob; check the shit he did
He spent more time making the band than Diddy did
You feel my campaign, then drop your old spouse
I'm out in DC at the white and gold house
Wanna convince me, love? Secret service me with some of that Lewinsky love
She saw the chain, gave me brain, no strain ever since
Now that's what I call a real chain of events, nigga

[Chorus]

Diamonds on my damn chain! 
It ain't hard to tell!
