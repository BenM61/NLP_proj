Fed my eyes on you girl
Dived deep into your world
Watched my life go down the drain
I drew upon myself
For too long now
Feels like I'm not your savior anymore

Will I float here forever and a day
Drifting sideways
In a world I'll never understand
Will I float here forever and a day
Drifting sideways
I'm dying here like always

Walked the line for you girl
Almost drowned in your realm
Watched myself wasting away
You've been a drag on me for much too long
Feels like I'm not your savior anymore
