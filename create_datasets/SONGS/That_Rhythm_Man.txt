Now the tress all sway to rhythm
And the children play to rhythm
All the birdies flap their wings in rhythm too

Oh, the breezes float to rhythm
And the rivers flow to rhythm
Every flower nods in rhythm all day through

Now the trees all sway to rhythm
And the children play to rhythm
All the birdies flap their wings in rhythm too

Oh, the breezes float to rhythm
And the rivers flow to rhythm
Every flower nods in rhythm all day through

Every dance and every melody
Acts according to this recipe

Everybody walks to rhythm
Everybody talks to rhythm
Seems like the world can do without that rhythm man
