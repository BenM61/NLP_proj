I speak my mind 
I don't hold it back,
That's how I am, 
And I'm hopin' that's where you' at
Like I lay it on the line, 
Think that's how it should be
If you're gonna make it, man you've got to agree 

I'm a stone cold believer, yes, I am,
I believe you can do it 
If you say that you can
I'm a stone cold believer, not a smooth talkin' man,
Believe I got things well at hand 

Wanna climb that ladder, 
You wanna make it to the top,
Takes only one thing, 
Gotta give it all y' got
Knew a man who couldn't lose, 
'Cause he never gave in,
He stuck to his pistol well it made him a better man 

I'm a stone cold believer, yes, I am,
I believe you can do it 
If you say that you can
I'm a stone cold believer, not a smooth talkin' man,
Believe I got things well at hand

I'm a stone cold believer, yes, I am,
I believe you can do it 
If you say that you can
I'm a stone cold believer, not a smooth talkin' man,
Believe I got things well at hand

I'm a stone cold believer, yes, I am,
I believe you can do it 
If you say that you can
I'm a stone cold believer, not a smooth talkin' man,
Believe I got things well at hand
