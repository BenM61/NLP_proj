Just let me ask you,
"Hey, have you heard of my religion?"
It's called the church of hot addiction,
And we believe that God is lust for everything.
Because now,
The time has come for your devotion,
And you already got the motion.
What I need to just give it, give it, give it to me
(I'm waiting, I'm waiting. Turn out the lights.)

Tonight
I am the drug you can't deny.
Tonight
Gonna get you high.
My love is electric.

Just let me tell you,
"Hey, you gotta get the cobra blessed now."
You're really only selling sex now,
But I can pay the price you charge for what I need.
Cause I,
I got a messy new compulsion
And you already got a notion
Of what I need
So give it, just give it, just give it to me
(I'm waiting I'm waiting. Turn out the lights.)

Tonight
I am the drug you can't deny.

Gonna get you high.
