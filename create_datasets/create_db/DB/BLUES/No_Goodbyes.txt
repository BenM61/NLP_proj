Yeah no more tears, no more goodbyes

Don't you know it's time for me to go
Even though it hurts to see you cry
But don't you know you'll never be alone
If you hold me deep inside (oh yeah)

You know that Iwould rather stay
But now before I turn away
There's one last thing to you
I want to say

[Chorus]
Baby there's no goodbyes
I'll always be right by your side
I may be far away
You know that my heart will stay, with you, always

Now I've pictures in the distance
Even though it seems a million miles
But there'll be no space between us
I'll be there everytime you close you eyes. Yes I will (oh)

You know that I would rather stay
But now before I turn away
There's one last thing to you
I want to say

[Chorus]

I don't want to say words that people say
'cause when I go, my love will stay

In the heart of you to help you make it trough
Baby that is why there can be no. No goodbyes

[Chorus x2]

You know what no more goodbyes
