Out of nothing you came to my arms and you're right,
I fell every time.
You're the first and the last time that I'll ever try, 
So dry your eyes.

I'll say goodbye.
I'll say goodbye.

I'm left hanging like all dancing bears I need rope,
To keep me in line.
I can't stop them there's more bombshells coming I choke, 
More words, more lies.

I'll say goodbye.
I'll say goodbye.

I can't believe it's come to this,
I'm banging on a sinking ship, 
Hoping someone hears my list.
For every trial I'll take the fall,
And never notice it no more.
What we had won't conquer all.
And while the shots still ringing out,
You do your worst to bring me down.
You do your worst to take me out. 

I'll say goodbye.
I'll say goodbye.
