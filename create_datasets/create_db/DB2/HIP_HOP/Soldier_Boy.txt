Soldier boy,
Oh, my little soldier boy,
I'll be true to you.

You were my first love
And you'll be my last love.
I will never make you blue.
I'll be true to you.
In this whole world
You can love but one girl.
Let me be that one girl,
For I'll be true to you.

Wherever you go,
My heart will follow.
I love you so.
I'll be true to you.
Take my love with you
To any port or foreign shore.
Darling, you must feel for sure,
I'll be true to you.

Soldier boy,
Oh, my little soldier boy,
I'll be true to you.
