To you and all your family, your neighbors and your friends
May all your days be happy with a joy that never ends
May peace and love surround you
At Christmas time and all the whole year through

I'm looking out my window at the softly falling snow
That dances in the early morning light
I got my guitar right before me, strummin' a beautiful sound
Watching it a-comin' down, all around
On the fields, and the farms, and the road to town

And I'm thinkin' up a letter that I'm writin' in my head
A Christmas card to all the folks I love
Instead of lettin' the postman bring it
I decided I'd rather sing it
Especially for you, for you

To you and all your family, your neighbors and your friends
May all your days be happy with a joy that never ends
May peace and love surround you
At Christmas time and all the whole year through

May your life be filled with sunshine, may your every wish come true
May you find the sweet fulfillment in everything you do
May your days be blessed with the very, very best
Both now and the whole year through
It says so in my Christmas card to

To you and all your family, your neighbors and your friends
May all your days be happy with a joy that never ends
May peace and love surround you
At Christmas time and all the whole year through

At Christmas time and all the whole year through
