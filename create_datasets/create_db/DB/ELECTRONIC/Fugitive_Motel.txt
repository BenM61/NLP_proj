Lost in a lullaby 
Side of the road
Melt in a memory
Slide in a solitude
Not 'til I can read by the moon
Am I going anywhere
Not 'til I can read by the moon

I blow you a kiss
It should reach you tomorrow
As it flies from the other side of the world
From my room in my fugitive motel
Somewhere in the dust bowl
Yeah it flies from the other side of the world

I'm tired, I said
You always look tired, she said
I'm admired, I said
You always look tired, she said

Not 'til I can read by the moon
I'm not going anywhere
Not 'til I can read by the moon

I blow you a kiss
It should reach you tomorrow
As it flies from the other side of the world
From my room in my fugitive motel
Somewhere in the dust bowl
Somewhere in the dust bowl
It flies from the other side of the world

The curtains stay closed
But everyone knows
You hear through the walls in this place
Cigarette holes for every lost soul
To give up the ghost in this place

Give me strength
Give me wings
Give me strength
Give me wings

I blow you a kiss
It should reach you tomorrow
Reach you tomorrow
It flies from the other side of the world
From my room in my fugitive motel
Somewhere in the dust bowl
Somewhere in the dust bowl
It flies from the other side of the world
The other side of the world
The other side of the world

(The other side of the world)
