Jimmy's outside with his motor engine hummin' 
Sent me along to see if you were comin' 
Out onto the highway gonna break the city limits 
Jimmy's gettin' ready gonna put his foot in it 
Soft shoe Louie drinkin' with his floozy Sue 
Got the invitation the burn out's due 

I'd be a rebel when I'm good and ready headin' for the bar 
Tell Jimmy to cool it but not to go too far 

Burn out on highway 9 
There's gonna be a burn out on highway 9

Louie and Jimmy didn't know about the plan 
Cops out on the highway, gonna take the job at hand 
Been hidin' out for Louie gonna get him canned 
Gonna catch him in the action 
He's gonna wanna make a stand 

Jimmy's impatient wants to burn on rubber 
He's gotta wait for Louie 'cause there ain't no other 
The undisputed king of the road said 
"Jimmy, I'm ready, you better shift your load" 

Burn out on highway 9 
There's gonna be a burn out on highway 9
Come on, and get it, boy 

Louie and Jimmy's out to have a fight 
Shakin' hands with the man below 
Stokin' out the flames, flames burnin' higher 
One of them has gotta go 
One of them has gotta go 

Highway 9 and they're starting to roll 
Jimmy's hearts thumpin', blood runnin' cold 
Louie looks over and gives a sly smile 
Says, look in your mirror, boy, cops are behind 
Get a move on Jimmy, you're fallin' for the trap 
There's only one winner, the loser takes the rap 
Well, bye bye Jimmy, don't wait for me inside 
I'm goin' back to floozy Sue and thanks for the ride 

Burn out on highway 9 
There's gonna be a burn out on highway 9 (it's gonna be a burn out)
Burn out on highway 9 
There's gonna be a burn out on highway 9
