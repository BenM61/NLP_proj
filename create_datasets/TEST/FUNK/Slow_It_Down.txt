I know they ain't gon play this on top 40 radio
But the white girls still gon' ride it like a rodeo
And I'ma stay ridin' this beat like a rodeo
And keep throwin' money til shorty gon' touch her toes
I'ma keep it real with you baby you bad
Kinda like Michael Jackson you bad
If you was my girl and left me I be sad
And for that let me see that ass

I'm here to see that thing pop
I'm here to see that thing rock
I'm here to see you pick it up and let it drop
She backin' it up on me, DJ you know you wrong
Enough with the mothafuckin' dance songs

You gotta slow it down
Down down down
Down down down
So she can take her time and work it on me babe
DJ you gotta slow it down
Down down down
Down down down
Whisper in her ear while she on me babe
You gotta slow it down
Down down down
Down down down
Just swing it left, swing it right
DJ you gotta slow it down
Down down down
Down down down
Uh huh that's what she likes (DJ you gotta slow it)

Now she rollin' that and whippin' her hair
Slow motion with it while everyone stares
You can see her ass from a satellite
Back and forth, forth and back
Show me what they do this that
Always with ya baby Ill never sell out
Them other niggas had to do a dance record
Or the label wouldn't put 'em out
I'll never put a million records before you
Just keep on doing that thing you do

I'm here to see that thing pop
I'm here to see that thing rock
I'm here to see you pick it up and let it drop
She backin' it up on me, DJ you know you wrong
Enough with the mothafuckin' dance songs

You gotta slow it down
Down down down
Down down down
So she can take her time and work it on me babe
DJ you gotta slow it down
Down down down
Down down down
Whisper in her ear while she on me babe
You gotta slow it down
Down down down
Down down down
Just swing it left, swing it right
DJ you gotta slow it down
Down down down
Down down down
Uh huh that's what she likes

Erybody know slow money, way better than no money
Except for those who don't know shit
Don't know women and don't own money
It starts out I'm so cool
We hangin' out and I'm so funny
All of a sudden I'm Winnie the Pooh
All up in your honey
Pants on her slim fit
Lights in the room dim lit
And I'm feelin' on your booty on some R Kelly and Lil Kim shit
Pants on her slim fit
Lights in the room dim lit
And I'm feelin' on your booty on some R Kelly and Lil Kim shit

Slow it down
Down down down (Hey Mr. DJ)
Down down down
So she can take her time and work it on me babe
DJ you gotta slow it down
Down down down (I'm just tryin' to dance with my baby)
Down down down
Whisper in her ear while she on me babe
You gotta slow it down
Down down down (I said please Mr. DJ)
Down down down
Just swing it left, swing it right
DJ you gotta slow it down (Man I'm just tryin' to)
Down down down (Man I'm just tryin' to)
Down down down (Man I'm just tryin' to dance with my baby)
That's what she likes (Down)

I'ma keep it real with you baby you bad
Kinda like Michael Jackson you bad
If you was my girl and you left me I be sad
And for that let me see that ass (drop)
