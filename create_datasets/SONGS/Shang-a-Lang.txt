We were rippin' up
We were rockin' up
Roll it over and lay it down

We were shakin' up 
We were breakin' up
We were rockin' to the shang-a-lang sound of the music

Hey, hey, rockin' to the music
Hey, hey, rocking to the music
Rocking every night and day, hey hey

Well we sang shang-a-lang as we ran with the gang
Doin' doo wop be dooby do ay
We were all in the news
With our blue suede shoes
And our dancin' the night away

Yeah we sang shang-a-lang
And we ran with the gang
Doin' doo wop be dooby do ay
With the jukebox playing and everybody saying that
Music like ours couldn't die

We were grooving
We were movin'
Pussyfootin' and putting it round
We were boppin'
We were hoppin'
We were jumping to the shang-a-lang sound of the music

Hey, hey, rockin' to the music
Hey, hey, rockin' to the music
Rocking every night and day, hey hey

We sang shang-a-lang
And we ran with the gang
Doin' doo wop be dooby do ay
We were all in the news
With our blue suede shoes
And our dancin' the night away

Yeah we sang shang-a-lang
And we ran with the gang
Doin' doo wop be dooby do ay
With the jukebox playing and everybody saying that
Music like ours couldn't die

Shang-a-lang,
Shang-a-lang,
Shang-a-lang
Shang-a-lang, shang-a-lang, shang-a-lang

Yeah we sang shang-a-lang
And we ran with the gang
Doin' doo wop be dooby do ay
With the jukebox playing and everybody saying that
Music like ours couldn't die

Well we sang shang-a-lang
And we ran with the gang
Doin' doo wop be dooby do ay
We were all in the news
With our blue suede shoes
And our dancin' the night away
