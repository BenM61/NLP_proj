He broke my heart today
I don't know what to say
I can't feel a thing at all
I did not see it comin'
Now you just a man that got away
I look at the ground
And give the sky the middle finger
Something inside said
"Here's a day you should remember
So mark it on a wall"
I never believed it could happen to me
Something like this only happens to dumb girls
Taking themselves too seriously
I was so damn smart
I was the one girl
Who never believed it could happen to me
Something like this only happens to somebody else
I miss you so much
Can't stand it
You bring out the blonde in me
'Cause I'm still hanging on
Even though you done me wrong.
And I got the heart to forgive this
But I'd never let you know.
What kind of girl would put herself 
In that position?
Yeah
To think that I could ever fight the system
And I got fooled again
I never believed it could happen to me
Something like this only happens to dumb girls
Taking themselves too seriously
I was so damn smart
I was the one girl
Who never believed it could happen to me
Something like this only happens to somebody else
I thought I was strong (I thought I was strong)
But I was just dreamin'
I can't believe it (can't believe it)
That nothing was wrong (nothing was wrong)
I thought I knew what was goin' on
But love was deceiving me (love was deceiving me)
Now I'm just a dumb girl
Yeah
A dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb girl
That's what I am
Yeah, yeah 
I can't believe that it happened to me
Something like this only happens to dumb girls
Taking themselves too seriously
I was so damn smart, yeah
I was the one girl
Who never believed it could happen to me
Something like this only happens to somebody else
(Only shit like this would happen to me)
Can't believe this shit could happen to me
Yeah, yeah
'Cause something like this only happens to somebody else
I guess I'm just a dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb girl
That's what I am
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb girl
