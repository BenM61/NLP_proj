You told me that your love was true
But look at me girl, now I'm blue
Because you cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, you cheated
You cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, you cheated
You gave your love so tenderly
And then you took it away from me
You lied to me (you lied, you lied, you lied, you lied)

You ran around and then you put me down
How could you be so cruel
After I was so cruel to you, tell me why

You lie

You told me that your love was true
But look at me girl, now I'm blue
Because you cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, you cheated
Because you cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, you cheated
You gave your love so tenderly
And then you took it away from me
You lied to me (you lied, you lied, you lied, you lied)

You lied, lied, lied, lied, you lied to your daddy
You lied, lied, lied, lied, you lied to your daddy
You cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, you cheated
