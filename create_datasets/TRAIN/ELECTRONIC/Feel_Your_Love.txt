Baby, I've got this thing for you
I'm thinkin' there's somethin' goin' on now
A wicked imagination, a serious kind of somethin' new
It's drivin' me right out of my mind now, it's gotta be desperation

Can't feel no pain when I'm thinking about you
Dreamin' isn't black and white
Can't make no gain 'til my vision see-comes true
Give it to me like I'd like to give it to you

Oh ooh, love I wanna feel your love
Right from the bottom of your heart to your hands
Now baby now, love I wanna feel your love
You know this waitin' for you boy I can't stand

Bein' just who you wanna be and doin' whatever
Comes to mind boy, I gotta get information
Never knew what to do with you
You're givin' me somethin' to hold on to my newest infatuation

'People Power' means I gotta believe you
Can't you hear the voices callin'
Keep your flowers 'cause their color'll turn blue
Give it to me like I'd like to give it to you

Oh ooh, love I wanna feel your love
Right from the bottom of your heart to your hands
Now baby now, love I wanna feel your love
You know this waitin' for you boy I can't stand

Party time is anytime
And anytime is party time

Bring down that boys

Love I wanna feel your love
Right from the bottom of your heart to your hands
Now baby now, love I wanna feel your love
You know this waitin' for you boy I can't stand

Oh ooh, love I wanna feel your love
Right from the bottom of your heart to your hands
Now baby now, love I want to feel your love
You know this waitin' for you boy I can't stand

You got to have love
You got to have it
You got to have love
Oh baby, now here I'm wait

You got to have love
You got to have it
You know this waitin' for you boy I can't stand

You got to have love
You got to have it
You got to have love
