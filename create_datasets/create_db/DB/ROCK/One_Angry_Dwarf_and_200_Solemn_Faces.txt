September '75 I was 47 inches high 
Mom said someday I would have 
A bad ass mother G.I. Joe 
For your little minds to blow 
I still got beat up after class 

Now I'm big and important
One angry dwarf 
And 200 solemn faces 
Are you 
If you want to see me 
Check your papers and your T.V. 
Look who's tellin' who what to do 
Kiss my ass good-bye 

Don't give me that bullshit 
You know who I am 
I'm your nightmare little man 
Vic you stole my lunch money. 
Made me cry. 

Jane remember second grade 
Said you couldn't stand my face 
Rather than kiss me you said 
You'd rather die 

Now I'm big and important 
One angry dwarf 
And 200 solemn faces 
Are you 
If you want to see me 
Check your papers and your T.V. 
Look who's tellin' who what to do 
Kiss my ass good-bye 

You'll be sorry one day 
Yes you will, yes you will 
You shouldn't push me around 
Cause I will, yes I will 
You will be sorry when I'm big 
Yes you will be sorry
