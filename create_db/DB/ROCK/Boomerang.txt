The fire was out,
But then the phone rang.
And all of the heat came back again.
As much as I try your hard to resist
All that it takes is just one kiss

And I putty in your hands
I'm under your spell
You send me spinning

You pull me in close,
You throw me away
I keep coming back like a boomerang.
You tell me to go,
You beg me to stay.

I keep coming back like a boomerang
Round and Round and Round and back again.
Round and Round and Round and back again.

Your treating me like I'm your little toy
You tell me I'm not like other boys.
The next thing I know you toss me aside
You don't even bother with goodbyes.

But when you say hello
I cant ignore you
You send me spinning.

You pull me in close,
You throw me away
I keep coming back like a boomerang.
You tell me to go,
You beg me to stay.
I keep coming back like a boomerang

Round and Round and Round and back again.
Round and Round and Round and back again.
Round and Round and Round and back again.
Round and Round and Round and back again.

Boom, Boom, Boom
And now my heart is racing
Boom, Boom, Boom
And after you I'm chasing
Boom, Boom, Boom
You got to catch me when I fall.
You send me spinning

You pull me in close,
You throw me away
I keep coming back like a boomerang.
You tell me to go,
You beg me to stay.
I keep coming back like a boomerang

Round and Round and Round and back again.
Round and Round and Round and back again.
Round and Round and Round and back again.
Round and Round and Round and back again.
