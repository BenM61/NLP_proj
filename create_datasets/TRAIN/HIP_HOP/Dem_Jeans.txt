How the, how the hell did you get all o' that in dem jeans?

Model in dem jeans for me, luxury, now that's your life

That's the type of shit I'm on, let me see you get them on
Back it up a bit, yeah, that's it 'cause I can see your thong
Caramel skin tone, damn, you look like Nia Long
Don't be actin' like that, lil' mama 'cause I can leave you 'lone

Mix the lime with that Patron, that's what we drinkin' on

Am I right? You right, baby, that's what's up

Now, now, now when you walkin', girl and you make it swirl
It's hard for me to look and not want you up in my world
Bubbled up, ohh, pokin' out, hey
Lickin' my lip sayin', ?Shawty, swing it my way?

I hope you ain't up in here with your man, ma
I love it when you wiggle it and shake it
Drop, trick it, drop and do your little dance, ma

True Religion, 7's or dem Rocking Republic
Or the ones that fit the best and show it just how we love it
Know just how to hug it, know just how to cuff it
So when you walk away, it make me wanna rub and say

Got your boy in the mood, let's go back to my jacuzz'
I ain't like them other fools, gotta play by my rules
Face down, ass up, pants off, look, ooh
