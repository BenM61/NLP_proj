He made a record
it made him famous
yes it made him a star.
The life and soul of the party
he rocks he shocks

You never know where you are with him.
He got no sense but he got money
He got no sense but he got overnight success

Exceed excess exceed excess.
He no big deal he's just a wide boy
He no big deal he's just an ordinary guy
Oh me oh my oh me oh my.

He made a movie
he played the driver of a big yellow car.
He is super fab and groovy
he struts and he crows

You never know where you are with him.
He got no sense but he got money
He got no sense but he got overnight success

Exceed excess exceed excess.
He no big deal he's just a wide boy
He no big deal he's just an ordinary guy
Oh me oh my oh me oh my.

And with your symmetry teeth 
and your california tan
I'm here to tell you that you ain't no superman
you're just a wide boy.
