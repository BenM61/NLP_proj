You know, I'm no beginner
My hearts been to the wall
I'm a tried and true romantic
Who's seen and done it all

And when you walked into my life
Suddenly I knew
All the love I had inside
Was leading me to you

In my time
I've lived and loved so much
Through each high and low
I let my heart be touched

In my time
There isn't much I've missed
I've seen love come and go, but heaven knows
I've never loved like this in my time

After all that I've been through
I'm in love with you

I've won some and I've lost some
But us dreamers don't complain
We keep reaching out for passion
No matter what the pain

When I looked into your eyes
It all fell into place
I found, what I was searching for
Shining in your face

In my time
I've lived and loved so much
Through each high and low
I let my heart be touched

In my time
There isn't much I've missed
I've seen love come and go, but heaven knows
I've never loved like this in my time

After all that I've been through
I'm in love with you

In my time
I've lived and loved so much
Through each high and low
I let my heart be touched

In my time
There isn't much I've missed
I've seen love come and go, but heaven knows
I've never loved like this in my time

After all that I've been through
I'm in love with you
