Come on, tune in to the light
Black sky, blue world, green eyes
And you'll come running
To the dark side of the moon
And 'though you'll never find us
We'll still be watching you
Come on, tune in to the life
Black sky, blue world, green eyes
No peace for the wicked
No rest for the good
No use in pretending
Love is in your blood
Come on, tune in to the light
Black sky, blue world, green eyes
Come on...
