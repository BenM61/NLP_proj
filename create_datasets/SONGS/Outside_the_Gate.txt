In the morning as I come around, rub my eyes and look outside
Watching, absorbing the underworld - reflections of a monstrous soul within
Power stations and power games - this sickness called society
I have identified the forces behind these changes that I see

I put on my mask
I walk down the path
I go through the arch
Outside the gate

I have walked blkac lava fields of the northern hemisphere
I have travelled the Andes range, across Pacific isles
There is no escape in the waking world from that which is approaching us fast
Salvation is drawn from our childhoos dreams
In lands of beauty untainted by cynicism

I put on my mask
I walk down the path
I go through the arch
Outside the gate

He invokes entities vast and mindless!

We shall taste unimaginable joys a thousand times greater than these!
And when the stars assume their rightful place, man liberates a mindless race
Morals and laws shall be thrown aside - tap the millenial flame with pride
Gaze with wonder, embrace your fate

- A madman looks outside the gate!

I put on my mask
I walk down the path
I go through the arch
I close the gate
