You're sittin' here, all wrapped up in my arms
But your mind seems to be a mile away
And now and then you say um hm and aha
When you don't even know what I'm about to say

A penny for your thoughts, girl
A penny for your thoughts

Last night I called, they said you were out
I thought maybe you had gone to the grocery store
Now I know that you went on a lil' bit farther
'Cause I never saw you act this way before

A penny for your thoughts, girl
A penny for your thoughts

So bad I wanna ask you what's really on your mind
But I'm afraid of what the answer might be
Now I've always been told that love is blind
But I'd rather be blind than see you walk on away from me

So I close my eyes to what I know is goin' on
Just as long as I know that it makes you happy
'Cause in my eyes, girl, you can do no wrong
Just as long as you keep on givin' your love to me

A penny for your thoughts, girl
A penny for your thoughts
Oh, I wanna know ?
A penny for your thoughts

Oh, I wanna know, I wanna know, what's on your mind
But I'm afraid of what the answer will be
Penny for your thoughts, girl
Penny for your thoughts

Penny for your thoughts
Tell me what's on your mind
