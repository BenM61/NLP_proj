What's new what's goin' through
Bored with the American holstered blues
Peace signs on just about everything
Don't know where to turn or what they say

So won't you let me, come on through
Won't you love, sing along
Won't you come, to build a fire
Start a new, something blue
Won't you come, to build a fire

Come back its been trap
Steal your color, steal your snap
High-school girls in camouflage
Don't know where to end or where to start

So won't you let me, come on through
Won't you love, sing along
Won't you come, to build a fire
Start a new, something blue
Won't you come to build a fire

Solo
True-blue I know its you
Holes in my pockets, holes in my shoes
If he's so square he knows nothing at all
Then how come he's the only one with the ball

So won't you let me, come on through
Won't you give me, something new (well ya found out)

Won't you love, sing along
Won't you come, to build a fire
Start a new, something blue
Won't you come, to build a fire
Start again, to the end
Won't you come, to build a fire

Talkin', turn around, take your body to the wall
Walk West a thousand steps, take ya on now far to rest
Walk East sign of piece, meager now so tired of me
Turn around and head on South, tell ya what it all about
