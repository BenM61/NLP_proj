Here's to every time that you rock a boat
Here's to every word that you ever wrote
There were clues but it was never clear
You've got to choose your own way out of here

I could say anything you need, anyone you knew,
Anything you see, anything you say,
Anything you need, anyone you knew, anything you
It would be this it would be this.

I've been waiting for the spark myself,
I've been scrambling in the dark for health
I have read your words a thousand times
All this spark but smashed up love and crime.

I could say anything you need, anyone you see
Anything you knew, anything you say
Anything you need, anyone you knew, anything you
It would be this, it would be this

I've been choking on the bones and tears.
You are the smoking gun that thrown the years
A broken heart won't get you far enough,
All beat up waiting through the roof

I could say anything you need, anyone you see,
Anything you knew, anything you say,
Anything you need, anyone you knew, anything you
It would be this, it would be this
