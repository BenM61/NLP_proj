Touch, love, you
Touch, love, you

Will I miss the sky?
Will I miss the clouds?
Will I miss the ocean?
Will I miss the bay?

Will I miss the sunrise?
Will I miss the moon?
Will I miss the mountains?
Will I miss the trees?

Will I miss the city lights?
Will I miss the snow?
Will I miss the laughter?
Will I miss the jokes?

Will I miss touch?
Will I miss love?
Will I miss you?
Will I? Will I?

Will I? Will I?
Will I? Will I?
Will I?
Will I?
