This is the last time
That I'm ever gonna come here tonight
This is the last time I will fall 
Into a place that fails us all inside

And I can see the pain in you
And I can see the love in you
But fighting all the demons will take time
It will take time

The angels they burn inside for us 
Are we ever, are we ever gonna learn to fly
The devils they burn inside of us
Are we ever gonna come back down 
Come around
I'm always gonna worry about 
The things that could make us cold

This is the last time 
That I'm ever gonna give in tonight
Are there angels or devils crawling here?
I just want to know what blurs and what is clear to see 

Well, I can see the pain in you
With I can see the love in you
And fighting all the demons will take time
It will take time

The angels they burn inside for us 
And are we ever, are we ever gonna learn to fly
The devils they burn inside of us
And are we ever gonna come back down 
Come around 
I'm always gonna worry about the things 
That could break us

And if I was to give in give it up and then
I take a breath make it deep
'Cause it might be the last one you get
Be the last one 
That could make us cold
That could make us cold
I'm always gonna worry about 
The things that could make us cold
