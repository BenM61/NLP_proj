Well I laid down one night, late one Saturday night
Well I laid down one night, late one Saturday night
I was thinkin' 'bout my baby, and she just wouldn't treat me right

I didn't mistreat you baby, honey why don't you treat me right
I didn't mistreat you baby, honey why don't you treat me right
I been weepin' on my pillow, because you didn't come home last night

You got evil ways baby, you won't let me sleep at night
You got evil ways baby, you won't let me sleep at night
I got to find me another woman, that don't want to fuss and fight

Well goodbye baby, I may never see you any more
Well goodbye baby, I may never see you any more
But you should always remember darlin', Ill love you everywhere I go
