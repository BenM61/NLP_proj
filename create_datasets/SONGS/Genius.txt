Genio!

You would have to be a genius to work out what it is with us
And I'm no budding genius so what would I know?
You would have to have a first degree to understand the history
Or study anthropology, so what would I know?

I know that in South America, they're burning down the trees
Stoking up the fires of Western industries
And you would have to be a genius to work out what
It is with us, and I'm no budding genius, but some things
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know,
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know,
I know, I know, I know!

Voc(e) teria que ser un genio
Para saber o que se passa com a gente
Mas eu nao sou em genio
Entao o que sei eu?

Voce tem que ter un diploma
Para entender a historia
Ou estudar anthropologia
Entao o que sei eu?

I know that in South America, they're burning down the trees
Stoking up the fires of Western industries
And you would have to be a genius to work out what
It is with us, and I'm no budding genius, but some things
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know,
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know,
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know...
