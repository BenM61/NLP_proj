Baby... Oh...
Beautiful girl I mess wit you 
Wish you would love me I progress one 
She gave me what I've been looking for

Says she wants a man like me in her life
Not from the minta minta goals alright
She talk about her lady's every night...
I don't want to talk about 

What I had before
So what I want to do right now
Is give you love galore
Baby...

Bounce along, bounce along
Only you can turn me on
Bounce along, bounce along 
Bounce along, bounce along
Only you can turn me on 
Bounce along, bounce along

Maybe all I believe is what seen in you
Love every single thing you do
Clearly I can see you want me too
Lately I've been talking to my self

Saying I don't need nobody else
'Cause all I'm searching for I found in you
I don't want to sleep alone
Without you in my bed

'Cause when you're not around my love
You're messing up me head
Baby...

Bounce along, bounce along
Only you can turn me on
Bounce along, bounce along 
Bounce along, bounce along
Only you can turn me on 
Bounce along, bounce along
