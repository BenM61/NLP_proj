You never had it easy, I know
But I still remember you
And what we used to say so
I say, this my song for you my friend
You can only see that I
Can hardly let things go, no, oh, yea
So listen to the sound of my voice
You better send him all my love
He's given me no choice, no, no, no
Listen to the sound of the boys, huh!
A raggamuffin is a freedom fighter
He's handling a choice
And I know that if

The raggamuffin is one of the friend
What you see is what you really get in the end
But what you're ever gonna, gonna do, I don't know
And the raggamuffin shall not fall down
'Cause she has the wisdom of a not fool around
But why did you have to leave the good sense on the ground, yes

You never had it easy, I know
But I still remember you
And what we used to have so
I say, this my song for you my friend
You can only see that I
Will never forget ye-yes so

Ooh wow wow, yeah
Ooh wow wow, yeah yeah
Ooh wow wow, yeah
Ooh wow wow, yeah yeah

So the raggamuffin is one of the friend
What you see is what you really get in the end
But what you're ever gonna, gonna do, I don't know
And the raggamuffin shall not fall down
'Cause she has the wisdom of a not fool around
But why did you have to leave the good sense on the ground, yes
