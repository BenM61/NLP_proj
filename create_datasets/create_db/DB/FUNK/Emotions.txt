You glance my way, I almost lost control
Anxiety has taken hold, my body quivers
You flash every night in my sleep, gazing deep into my eyes
You spoke these words, I was hypnotized
Let me share a night in your fantasy

Turn on emotions so strong, tensions fire burns on and on
My body screams, please make love to me
You're the object of my desire
Come on baby, light my fire

When I go to sleep at night, visions of you here by my side
Fireworks explode deep inside of me, I pinch myself as you're lying there
We kiss each other, now, I'm really scared
Too much to ask, even for a fantasy

Turn on emotions so strong, passions fire burns on and on
My body screams, please make love to me
You're the object of my desire
Come on baby, light my fire

'Cuz your the object of my desire
Hey, you really turn me on
You're the object of my desire
Won't you ignite my fire?

Hey, you really turn me on and on and on and on
I need your love
