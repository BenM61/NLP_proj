Wake up and shower we gonna meat in an hour 
I'm already shaking my anticipation loosing my patient yeah three days I've been waitin' 
Can't get no concentration what do you think I want
Don't want a dime of your money don't want movies and roses 
What do you think I want I want to hear moaning I want touching and kissing
You'll know when its real when I wake you say oh
That feel good you know how you can tell when its real 
Sexual healing its much more then feeling my heart needs healing
And I ain't even trippin' I'm crazy about us
He knows how to work it and he knows how to to work it 
What do you think I want I want a little conversation 
We both know our intention 
What do you think I want 
I wanna see couch pillows rolling I wanna see wrinkles in covers 
You know when its real it'll make you say oh that feels good
You know how you can tell its real it'll make you say oh that feels good
