This song goes out to all you fellas
Who think your kisses are sweet as candy
But honey got you beat by a million miles

*Your kiss is sweet, as sweet as candy
But honey beat your kisses by a million miles
Your kiss is sweet, as sweet as candy
But honey beat your kisses by a million miles

You came and entered my love and ran away
Leaving these eyes of mine crying every day
Now you are back and are saying you want to stay
When you left you stayed too long
Might as well keep moving on and on and on and on and on

You came and entered my love and ran away
Leaving these eyes of mine crying every day
Now you are back and are saying you want to stay
When you left you stayed too long
Might as well keep moving on and on and on and on and on

To you my life was nothing but a game
Now you're here and I want to take the blame
How could you take all this time and I could feel the same
Sorry for the tears you cried
There's another I won't lie, I won't lie, I won't lie

So keep on going
So keep on going
