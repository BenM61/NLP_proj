OK yo?
I wake up late every morning
Managers calling, I'm still yawning
Get up wake up hair and makeup's
Waiting for you don't be stalling
This performance is important
I don't think I can put my all in
Hold on I was drunk last night
Now its all kicking in and I don't feel right
Gave my number to a breh who wasn't my type
Now my phones on silent I'm being polite
Now private callers get no love from me
Just let me be?

Oh my Gosh my days are getting longer
And there's no turning back I'm working a 9 to 5
To keep my contract did I say 9 I meant 1:30
I ain't no early birdy I'm lazy thats all that I can say
So make sure you heard me
And deres no turning back I'm working a 9 to 5

So you gotta do somthin' for channel you
Channel who sorry who I'm half way through a snooze
Oh! Channel you the ones that made me huge
Like Katie Prices boobs
Whoops I'm being rude
Where's my red bull and my sandwich, I need food
I can't handle this
I'm getting pissed like pampers throwing a tantrum, action
No I'd actually id rather catch my z's and count sheep in my sleep
Lets not wake her up she actually looks quite sweet

Oh my Gosh my days are getting longer
And there's no turning back cause I'm working a 9 to 5
To keep my contract did I say 9 I meant 1:30
I'm no early birdy I'm lazy thats all that I can say
So make sure you heard me
I ain't no early birdy
Won't wake up till 12:30
Would it be bothered to say much ere
So oh dear
Huh where am I man?
This? ain't good? what's going on?!

So my label would change my image
I'm a pink lipstick chick called dipstick
This ain't on my wish list
Oh shit I'm in FHM posing in a bikini
Next to a Lamborghini
Next stop the theme tune for Tweenies
I'm presenting see-beebies
Have you seen me?
Never again, am I drinking lambrini
Its alright Sov it's a dream just wake up?

Oh my Gosh my days are getting longer
And there's no turning back 'cause I'm working the 9 to 5
To keep my contract did I say 9 I meant 1:30
I'm no early birdy I'm lazy I'll say it again
To make sure ya heard me
I ain't no early birdy
Won't wake up to 12:30
And I can't be bothered to say much ere
So ill say it again
