Yeah, I can't deny it
On the inside, I'm slowly dyin'
But with a little love, it'll be alright
Just give me one more day
I promise I'll make it up to you
I never meant to hurt you, baby
Just trust me. . .listen. . .
I can't deny it
That you got me cryin' you see
And I'm, I'm slowly dyin'
So we can't give up tryin' to be
With a little love it will be all right
With a little kiss let me hold you tight
With a little peace it could be so fine
And baby don't you leave me tonight
I just need one more day
And I won't make you cry
Darlin' believe
And baby don't say goodbye
Look in my heart
And I won't tell you no lies
Just one more day
And loving me will be fine
People tell me that
True love is blind
But I'm trying to prove that
True love is kind
All I want Is to make things right
So won't you be my baby tonight
I just need one more day
And I won't make you cry
Darlin' believe
And baby don't say goodbye
Look in my heart
And I won't tell you no lies
Just one more day
And loving me will be fine
One more day
One more day
One more day
With a little love it will be all right
With a little kiss let me hold you tight
With a little peace it could be so fine
And baby don't you leave me tonight
I just need one more, day
Just one more day
Just one more day
Just one more day
One more day
One more day
One more day
One more day
