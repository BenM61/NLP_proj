Holding back the years 
Thinking of the fear I've had so long 
When somebody hears 
Listen to the fear that's gone 

Strangled by the wishes of pater 
Hoping for the arms of mater 
Get to meet her sooner or later 

I'll keep holding on 
I'll keep holding on 

Holding back the years 
Chance for me escape from all I've known 
Holding back the tears 
Cause nothing here has grown 
I've wasted all my tears 
Wasted all those years 
And nothing had the chance to be good 
Nothing ever could 

I'll keep holding on 
I'll keep holding on 

That's all I have today 
That's all I have to say
