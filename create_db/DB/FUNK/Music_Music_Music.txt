Put another nickel in, in the nickelodeon
All I want is having you and music, music, music!
I'd do anything for you, anything you'd want me to
All I want is kissing you and music, music, music! 
Closer, my dear come closer 
The nicest part of any melody 
Is when you're dancing close to me
Put another nickel in, in the nickelodeon 
All I want is loving you and music, music, music!
