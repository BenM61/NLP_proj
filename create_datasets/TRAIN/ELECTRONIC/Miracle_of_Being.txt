Welcome Mother Nature
 Welcome to your home
 Welcome to the place you used to own
 Decorations fading
 The writing on the wall
 Illusions of an era free for all 
 Your eyes will need a shelter
 A shelter from the pain
 Soaring smoke and burning drops of rain
 And all around society
 Is living on a prayer
 Religion holding fort from despair 
 The heat wave of a thousand fears
 Rainbows from a million tears
 Echoes of a symphony playing on your mind
 And even when the mornings clear
 Its hard to find a reason for
 The miracle of you and me
 The miracle of being 
 Reflection on the water
 Your face is still as night
 Staring like a curse in the frozen light
 The prince of hidden treasure
 He's kissed the green above
 And realised a ripple of your love
