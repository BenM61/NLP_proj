I have felt the comfort
Now what did I do to disappoint you?
Idle my emptiness
And it keeps returning to remind me

That I want to remain
A child with you forever
And hear as you lay before me
You tease me and tell me to stay
But what would you give
What would you give

I have given everything I could
But I don't think it really matters
Maybe nothing does
And how it keeps returning to remind me

That I want to remain
A child with you forever
And hear as you lay before me
You tease me and tell me to stay
What would you give?
What would you give?

I want to remain
A child with you forever
And hear as you lay before me
You tease me and tell me to stay
What would you give?
What would you give?
What would you give?
What would you give?
