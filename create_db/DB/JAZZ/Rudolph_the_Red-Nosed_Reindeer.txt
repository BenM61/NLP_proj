You know Dasher and Dancer
Prancer and Vixen
You know Comet and Cupid
Donner and Blitzen
Say, but do you recall
That most important reindeer of all?
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer

Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They wouldn't let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games
But then one foggy Christmas Eve

Santa came to say
"Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
"Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history."

Rock it, Rudolph
Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
"Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"

Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
"Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history."
