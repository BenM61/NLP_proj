Hey, hey, hey, Fritz
Your key fits nicely
My body opens to your touch
So ring my bell and just entice me
I need your lovin', oh so much
Cause he's wild and, baby, when he aims he hits
Oh, Fritz, I know you love my tits
Fritz, Fritz, beat it, Fritz
So take your fingers off her tits
And if she says she loves you too
It's a lie, oh my, it just ain't true
Fritz, Fritz, listen, Fritz
Don't tell me it's your key that fits
You say she's yours, but I say well
I'm gonna get you down to hell
Hey, hey, hey, Fritz
Your key fits nicely
My body opens to your touch
So ring my bell and just entice me
I need your lovin', oh, so much
Hey, hey, hey, Fritz
I know I thrill you
But if you love me, please take care
Cause if Max dance he'll be will kill you
You better watch out for him, Fritz
Cause he's wild and, baby, when he aims he hits
Oh, Fritz, I know you love my tits
Fritz, Fritz, shut up, Fritz
And just stop lovin' on the Ritz
And don't you think you're big and strong
Because of your love no ding-a-dong
Fritz, Fritz, watch out, Fritz
You better leave your wife and kids
You say she wants you, but I say
You better move back home and pray
[chorus]
Oh, Fritz, I know you love my tits
Oh, Fritz, ooh
Ooh, ahhh, ahhh, ahhh, ooh
