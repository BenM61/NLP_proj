I danced in the surf
At the edge of an ocean
Could have been someone else
Could have been anything at all
Don't deny that you ask yourself

How do you weigh in this precious stone?
Oh, then I stumbled on a flaw
In the order
Unwrapped the gift
Spread the sheets to the border
There's no virtue
If there's no sin

How do you weigh in this precious stone?
At the point of no return
This precious stone
At the point of no return
This precious stone
At the point of no return
This precious stone
At the point of no return

At the end of the day
There's no me without you
At the end of the day
There's no me without you
So how do you weigh in
This precious stone?

Oh, I'm the tick in the clock
Of old father time
Feel the beat of the rock
Under the palm of my hand

Don't deny that you ask yourself
How do you weigh in
This precious stone?
