It's electric! 
You can't see it (it's electric!) 
You gotta feel it (it's electric!)
Ooh, it's shakin' (it's electric!)
Jiggle-a-mesa-cara 
She's a pumpin' like a matic 
She's a movin' like electric 
She sure got the boogie 

You gotta know it 
(It's electric 
Boogie woogie, woogie!)
Now you can't hold it 
(It's electric 
Boogie woogie, woogie!)
But you know it there, 
Here, there and everywhere 

I've got to move, 
I'm going on a party ride 
I've got to groove, groove, groove, 
And from this music 
I just can't hide

Are you comin' with me? 
Come let me take you on a party ride 
And I'll teach you, teach you, teach you 
I'll teach you the electric slide 

Some say it's mystic 
(It's electric 
Boogie woogie, woogie)
You can't resist it 
(It's electric 
Boogie woogie, woogie)
You can't do without it 
(It's electric 
Boogie woogie, woogie)
Jiggle-a-mesa-cara she's a pumpin' like a matic 
She's movin' like electric 
She sure got the boogie 

Don't want to lose it 
(It's electric 
Boogie woogie, woogie)
But you can't choose it 
(It's electric 
Boogie woogie, woogie)
But you know it's there, 
Here, there and everywhere 

I've got to move, 
Come let me take you on a party ride 
And I'll teach you, teach you, teach you 
I'll teach you the electric slide 

(Boogie woogie, woogie)

You can't see it 
(It's electric 
Boogie woogie, woogie)
You gotta feel it 
(It's electric 
Boogie woogie, woogie)
Ooh, it's shakin'
(It's electric 
Boogie woogie, woogie)
Jiggle-a-mesa-cara she's a pumpin' like a matic 
She's movin' like electric 
She sure got the boogie 

You gotta know it 
(It's electric 
Boogie woogie, woogie!)
Now you can't hold it 
(It's electric 
Boogie woogie, woogie!)
But you know it's there, 
Here, there and everywhere 

Ola ola eh, ola eh (don dela don deloh!)
Ola ola eh, ola eh (don dela don deloh!)
Ola ola eh, ola eh (don dela don deloh!)
Ola ola eh, ola eh (don dela don deloh!)
Ola ola eh, ola eh (don dela don deloh!)
