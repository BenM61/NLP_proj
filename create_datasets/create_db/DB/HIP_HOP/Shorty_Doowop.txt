Yea that's my shorty doowop
Yea that's my shorty doowop
Yea that's my shorty doowop
And I can't wait to be alone with you

I bet you ain't never seen a shorty so fly
Pushin catty plaint with the chrome choppin by
Throwin up player wave to my riders on the block
They all show love to my shorty doowop
In a juicy fruit jeans love that 315s
Livin' every fantasy and ghetto girl dreams
Watchin' swinging bang and she in another corner
Lookin' way cool comin' through with the doshure
Now after two honey bunts I discovered the buzz
I'm call her shorty she gonna call me love
And through the thick of it all
She excepted collect calls
When the daddy got caught up by the law

Yea that's my shorty doowop
Yea that's my shorty doowop
Yea that's my shorty doowop
And I can't wait to be alone with you

For real though, for real though, for real though
She the girl in the movie and I'm the hero
Stuck with me when I violated p-role
And came up when she started with zero
Baby Bash Latino Robert de Niro
She got with me 'cause her hubby was a weird-o
And yes sir she lookin' so mighty mighty
Love me 'cause I'm fresh and clean and so tighty
And there's a piece to the puzzle, the grind, the hustle
Respect when I'm good and love me when I'm in trouble
And yes sir, oh no, and yes sir she lookin' so throw

Yea that's my shorty doowop
Yea that's my shorty doowop
Yea that's my shorty doowop
And I can't wait to be alone with you

I can't wait to be alone with you
'Cause you the only boo who do the freaky things you do
You keep me feelin' high you keep my drama low
Yea I'm your shorty boy but you already know

Yea that's my shorty doowop
Yea that's my shorty doowop
Yea that's my shorty doowop
And I can't wait to be alone with you
