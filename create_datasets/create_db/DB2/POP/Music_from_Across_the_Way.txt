I shared the golden sun with her,
In days that are no more.
I used to love to run with her
Along the sandy shore.
She had a special prayer for me
To help my world go right.
Her hand was always there for me
The coldest winter night.

I hear the music from across the way,
Across the bridges of my mind.
I lift the misty shades of yesterday
To catch the dreams I left behind.

It was a joy to be with her,
To watch the way she smiled.
I guess I just felt free with her,
So free and young and wild.
I really came to love that girl;
How much she'll never know.
I need the nearness of that girl;
I really miss her so.

I hear the music from across the way,
Across the bridges of my mind.
I lift the misty shades of yesterday
To catch the dreams I left behind.

I hear the music from across the way,
Across the bridges of my mind.
I lift the misty shades of yesterday
To catch the dreams I left behind.
