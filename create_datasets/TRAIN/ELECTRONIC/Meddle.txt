I remember all the things she did before
I remember all the times she cried
I remember all the things you promised her
I know it hurt, I remember all the times you lied

Don't meddle with her heart, meddle with her mind
Meddle with the things that are inside
You don't know what you'll find
You don't know what she hides

So don't go messing with her heart or messing with her mind
Or messing with the things that are inside
You don't know what you'll find
You don't know what she hides

She still remembers like it's yesterday
She still remembers you so well
She still remembers all the things you saw forever more
She still remembers but won't tell

'Cause she's a mixed up girl in a mixed up world
And you know she don't mean any harm
So please understand if you take her hand
You'll get much more than you bargained for

Don't meddle with her heart, meddle with her mind
Meddle with the things that are inside
You don't know what you'll find
You don't know what she hides

So don't go messing with her heart or messing with her mind
Or messing with the things that are inside
You don't know what you'll find
You don't know what she hides

Don't meddle with her heart, meddle with her mind
Meddle with the things that are inside
You don't know what you'll find
You don't know what she hides

So don't go messing with her heart or messing with her mind
Or messing with the things that are inside
You don't know what you'll find
You don't know what she hides
