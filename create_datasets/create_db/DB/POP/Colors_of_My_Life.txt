The colors of my life, are bountiful and bold!
The purple glow of indigo, the gleam of green an' gold!
The splendor of a sunrise, the dazzle of a flame,
The glory of a rainbow, will put 'em all to shame!

No quiet browns or grays, I'll take my days instead,
And fill them 'till they overflow, with rose and cherry red!
And should this sunlit world, grow dark one day,
The colors of my life, will leave a shining light,
To show the way!

No quiet browns and grays, I'll take my days instead,
And fill them 'till they overflow, with rose and cherry red!
And should that sunlit world, grow dark one day,
The colors of my life, will leave a shining light,
The colors of my life will light the way!
