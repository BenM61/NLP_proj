I wish you'd stop and
Give a helping hand
For I guess I'm only half a man
I feel the only way for me to leave
Is just to give you
Everything I can give

'Cause without you, without you
What can I do

I will give you all the love I have
Just to know you stop me
Being so sad
I hope you won't think
So badly of me
'Cause I had to tell you
This could break myself in

Being helpless is a habit of mine
No one else can understand
You are the one to
Help me to survive
If you're any friend of mine

Yesterday you gave a helping hand
To some one you'll
Never understand
Though I tried to tell you of this way
You said I had nothing
Constructive to say

But without you, without you
What can I do...
