I know what you're thinking,
You're thinking about leaving, yeah,
you're thinking about leaving
You wonder what you're missing
You don't see me, yeah you're looking right through me.
And please, be wise, it's easy to be fooled by your own eyes baby, your eyes

Don't let smoke and mirrors make it crowded,
The truth you cannot see is hard to find
If you think you're better off without me
Remember what we have before you leave it all behind

Love is blind when it's new-your eyes play tricks on you,
yeah, your heart plays tricks on you.
Soon, your dream gets played out.
Baby it's real now, yeah it's real now, the pain we show,
think about how much it makes me hurt baby, be sure

Don't let smoke and mirrors make it crowded,
The truth you cannot see is hard to find
If you think you're better off without me
remember what we have before you leave it all behind
