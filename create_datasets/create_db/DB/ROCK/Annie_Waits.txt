And so
Annie waits, Annie waits, Annie waits
For a call
From a friend
The same
It's the same
Was it always the same?
Annie waits for the last time

The clock never stops, never stops, never waits
She's growing old
It's getting late
And so he forgot, he forgot
Maybe not
Maybe he's been seriously hurt
Would that be worse?

Headlights crest the hill
Shadows pass her by and out of sight
(ooh ooh)
Annie sees her dreams:
Friday bingo, pigeons in the park

Annie waits for the last time
Just the same as the last time

Annie says "You see this is why I'd rather be alone."

And so
Annie waits, Annie waits, Annie waits
For a call
From a friend
The same
It's the same
Was it always the same?
Annie waits as the last

Headlights crest the hill
Who will be the one for evermore?
(ooh ooh)
Annie, I could be
If we're both still lonely when we're old

Annie waits for the last time
Just the same as the last time
Annie waits for the last time
Just the same as the last time

Annie waits
But not for me
