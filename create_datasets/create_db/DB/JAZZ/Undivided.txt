We may worship different ways
We may praise Him
And yet spend all of our days
Living life divided

But when we seek Him with open hearts
He removes the walls we built
That keep us apart
We trust Him to unite us

In our hearts, we're undivided
Worshiping one Savior, one Lord
In our hearts, we're undivided
Bound by His spirit forevermore
Undivided

It doesn't matter if we agree
All He asks is that we serve Him faithfully
And love as He first loved us
He made us in His image

And in His eyes, we are all the same
And though out methods they may be different
Jesus is the bond that will remain

In our hearts, we're undivided
Worshiping one Savior, one Lord
In our hearts, we're undivided
Bound by His spirit forevermore
Undivided

In our hearts, we're undivided
Worshiping one Savior, one Lord
In our hearts, we're undivided
Bound by His spirit forevermore
Undivided
