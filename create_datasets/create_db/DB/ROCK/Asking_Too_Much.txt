I have no words that I can say
To make you see that
I know couldn't make you stay
I can not beat this

What have you done
This all seems so wrong
I hate that you let it end
And now that your gone
The nights seem so long
And I can't pretend

I know I'm asking to much
And your not coming back again
I know I'm asking to much
And you'll never be mine again
I'm not gonna find
You outside of my door
God damn I wanna let you in
I know I'm asking to much
And you'll never

And still the writings on the wall
To close to see it
You know this better then them all
You still don't believe it

What have you done
This all seem so wrong
I hate that you let it end
And now that your gone
The nights seem long
And I can't pretend

I know I'm asking to much
And not coming back again
I know I'm asking to much
And you'll never be mine again
I'm not gonna find
You outside of my door
But damn I wanna let you in
I know I'm asking to much
And you'll never be mine again

And now your gone but nothing makes this seem more wrong
The memory of your face keeps dragging me along
When I feel lost I know that I have to obey the cost
And now I'll find my way

I know I'm asking to much
And not coming back again
I know I'm asking to much
And you'll never be mine again
I'm not gonna find
You outside of my door
But damn I wanna let you in
I know I'm asking to much
And you'll never be mine again
