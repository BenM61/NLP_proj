I get so sick and tired
Of feeling sick and tired
When the lonely gets so old

On the wrong side of the road
'Tween the leaves and the velvet snow
I got lost in your eyes

Hand bone, hand bone, where you been?
Around the world, and he's gone again
Sunny days and I'm gettin' paid
It's welcome back the very next day

Oh, oh-ooh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-ooh-oh-oh
Get up and go
Get up and go

(Ooh na-na-na, hey)
(Ooh na-na-na, hey)
(Ooh, ooh)

Let me tell you 'bout this friend of mine
I fell in love for the very first time
In my life

Swing your partner, do-si-do
You're looking good in that sugar coat
'Til it's goodbye-bye-bye
Oh my-my-my

Oh, oh-ooh-oh-oh (ooh na-na-na, hey)
Oh, oh-ooh-oh-oh (ooh na-na-na, hey)
Get up and go
Get up and go

Oh, oh-ooh-oh-oh (ooh na-na-na, hey)
Oh, oh-ooh-oh-oh (ooh na-na-na, hey)
Get up and go
Get up and go

Hand bone, hand bone, where you been?
This Yankee diamond's wearing thin
And you can trust that there's nobody
Stop-stoppin' him

Oh, oh-ooh-oh-oh (ooh na-na-na, hey)
Oh, oh-ooh-oh-oh (ooh na-na-na, hey)
Get up and go
Get up and go

Oh, oh-ooh-oh-oh (ooh na-na-na, hey)
Oh, oh-ooh-oh-oh (ooh na-na-na, hey)
Get up and go
Get up and go

(Ooh na-na-na, hey)
(Ooh na-na-na, hey)
(Ooh, ooh)
