New Orleans Ladies 
A sassy style that will drive you crazy 
And they hold you likr the light 
Hug the wick when this candle's burning. 
Them Creole babies 
Thin and brown and doenright lazy 
And they roll just like the river 
A little wade will last forever 

All the way 
From Bourbon Street to Esplanade 
They sashay by
They sashay by

New Orleans Ladies 
A flair for life, love and laughter 
And they hold you like the night 
Holds a chill when this cold wind's blowing 
Them Creole babies 
They strut and sway from dusk till dawn 
And they roll like the river 
A little wade will last forever 

All the way 
From Bourbon Street to Esplanade 
They sashay by
They sashay by
