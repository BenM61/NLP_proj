From inside his mouth I licked the blood
While he is roaring and biting I wash off the mud
Cause the tempest is out to wrestle the wild
Stop charging my darling, come closer be quiet

Cause where you see a wall, I see a door
Set up with no map, and turn off your torch
Where you see a wall, I see a door
You'll get through, you'll be home
You'll be home

From inside his mouth I lick the scars
The woodland believes, marking a path
And if you just rest your head stop repeating the charge
You'll know that this time Iâ€™ll turn all the locks

Cause where you see a wall, I see a door
Set up with no map, and turn off your torch
Cause where you see a wall, I see a door
You'll get through, you'll be home
You'll be home

Just sit still. Does it hurt?
Does it hurt?

Just sit still. Does it hurt?
Does it hurt?

Just sit still. Does it hurt?
Does it hurt?

Just sit still. Does it hurt?
Does it hurt?
