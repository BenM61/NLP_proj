Uh, what you think a real nigga rap for?
So I can roll around in a Rav 4? Never that
Cadillac pimped out, fish bowl, true vo
Fifteens, but I had to go and get two mo
Whassup, get buck, shake junt killa
DJ booth with the pole in the middle
For the attitude, a bitch
See how far these gets
Pour up, the show up, the focus
The doors ain't typical when they get open, hol' up
You ain't never been sky high

Swear I coulda died when I hopped out my ride
Like four-five times, no parachute
Bungee jump for the loot
Hock a loogie off the roof, what I feel like
Porn on the screen, two hoes on the scene tongue kissin'
You would think my whip dyke

Cadillac lac lac lac, Cadillac lac lac lac, too early for the hook
Now shoot off with sawed-off for the bass and the trunk
That keep a nigga shook
Careful no crook, tell a bitch look
How I work the wheel and the crisis
Police behind us my index was grinding her pussy like
I think I'm nicest of all (all, all, all)
That's the way I feel, bitch! Crawl (crawl, crawl, crawl)
Why you showing your grill, bitch? (all, all, all)
Uh, I'm way outta here, don't get lost
I come in peace from somewhere unique
Have no fear, uh

Cadillac lac lac lac, Cadillac lac lac lac
Cadillac lac lac lac, Cadillac lac lac lac, lac
(F*ck yo' whip, nigga)
Cadillac lac lac lac, Cadillac lac lac lac
Cadillac lac lac lac, Cadillac lac lac lac, lac
(I took yo' bitch, nigga)
Cadillac lac lac lac, Cadillac lac lac lac
Cadillac lac lac lac, Cadillac lac lac lac, lac
(F*ck yo' whip, nigga)
Cadillac lac lac lac, Cadillac lac lac lac
Cadillac lac lac lac, Cadillac lac lac lac, lac
(I took yo' bitch, nigga)

Uh, what you think a real nigga rap for?
So I can roll around with a nympho? Yessir
Twenty five lighters on my dresser, the best of
Versace, Versace, Versace, my bezel
The bass and the treble will feel, ho
Komodo with the photo when creeping I'm, slow
I pull up on the high side, God give me high five
Every time I hop out, thank you Lawd
Jesus please, don't let the jackers take what's mine
Didn't have black out reach in the dash of the Lac  for "the act right"
'Cause a nigga act like I'ma just back down
And I'ma put some when you told bitch on these hoes bitch
I through the back out the trunk with the fifth wheel slump
It's some neon that's red, that's my old shit
But this some cold shit
That my granddaddy wish he could've drove when he passed out
Swinging on in a Chevy, I bring a ho down like a liver
When I slab 'round in this glass house
See, in the end it was easy pimpin' 'fore you even finished
When a trick trippin' you ain't need her with it
Shooting outside the Lac trying to ease in it
'Cause she might fall, fall, fall, fall, fall
Shit ain't really that high, bitch (crawl, crawl, crawl, crawl, crawl)
Why you showing your grill, bitch? (off, off, off, off, off)
Uh, I'm way outta here, don't get lost
I come in peace for someone unique
Have no fear, uh!

Slabbin round, my windows down, you hear the sound
That sonic boom, that ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bass
That shake your baby momma crib
Pardon me if I phone home four thousand miles away from where you at
If you ain't holdin back I can take your whip
