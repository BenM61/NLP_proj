Who needs you,
To drive me out of my mind
Who needs you,
I'd like to know
Who needs you 
To give me chills when I'm well
How fast can a helpless heart go

I know dear, I love you more than a lot
But oh! What I've got to go through
And so dear, I guess the answer is simply
Who needs you, I do

Each time we kiss goodnight
I find that I get so excited
I can't sleep at night
I've lost my appetite

No appetite, no sleep at night

I know dear, I love you more than a lot
But oh! What I've got to go through
And so dear, I guess the answer is simply
Who needs you, who needs you, I do
