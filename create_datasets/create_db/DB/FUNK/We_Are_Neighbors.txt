We are neighbors
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
We are neighbors
Whether we wanna be or not

Bom-bom-bom-bom, I told you so
Bom-bom-bom-bom, didn't you know?
Bom-bom-bom-bom, I told you so
Bom-bom-bom-bom, didn't you know?

If everybody looked the same
We'd get tired of looking at each other
You couldn't tell the lady next door
From your own damn mother

If variety ain't the spice of life
Then why are some
Peppercorn lights so nice?

You telling me things
That you can't do
It's not that you can't
It's that you just don't want to

We are neighbors
We are neighbors
We are neighbors
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
We are neighbors
Whether we wanna be or not

Bom-bom-bom-bom, I told you so
Bom-bom-bom-bom, didn't you know?
Bom-bom-bom-bom, I told you so
Bom-bom-bom-bom, didn't you know?

You put me in prison in my own house
(Yes, yes, you did)
And expect me to be quiet as a mouse
(Yes, yes, you did)

When I see it your way
You let me out
(Yes, yes, you did)

But here is something
To think about
(Yes, yes, you did)

The good and
The bad die together
Nobody's gonna live
Forever and ever

The truth is the light
That you should know
Let's walk in
The sunshine together

We are neighbors
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
We are neighbors
We are neighbors
We are neighbors
Whether we wanna be or not

Bom-bom-bom-bom, I told you so
Bom-bom-bom-bom, didn't you know
Bom-bom-bom-bom, I told you so
Bom-bom-bom-bom, didn't you know

We are neighbors
(Bom-bom-bom-bom, I told you so)
(Bom-bom-bom-bom, didn't you know?)
We are neighbors
(Bom-bom-bom-bom, I told you so)
(Bom-bom-bom-bom, didn't you know?)

We are neighbors
(Bom-bom-bom-bom, I told you so)
(Bom-bom-bom-bom, didn't you know?)
We are neighbors
(Bom-bom-bom-bom, I told you so)
(Bom-bom-bom-bom, didn't you know?)

We are neighbors
(Bom-bom-bom-bom, I told you so)
(Bom-bom-bom-bom, didn't you know?)
We are neighbors
(Bom-bom-bom-bom, I told you so)
(Bom-bom-bom-bom, didn't you know?)

We are neighbors

(Bom-bom-bom-bom, didn't you know?)
