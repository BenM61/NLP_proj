Living in the city I've been abused (He has)
Jobs I keep and people I meet
They don't do more than make me amused
Everywhere I turn now, just more bad news
So don't look now and don't ask how
Gonna find me a way to the animal zoo
Oh no, something went wrong
Well you're much too fat and a little too long
Hey hey, got too much to lose
Got to get on back to the animal zoo
Looking at my body, I'm slipin down (So far)
The air I breathe and the water I drink
Is selling me short and turning me around
Everyone I see now, on their way too (Everybody)
So don't look now and don't ask how
Gonna find a way home to the animal zoo
Oh no, something went wrong
Well you're much too fat and a little too long
Hey hey, got too much to lose
Got to get on home to the animal zoo
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
(Look Out)
Oh no, something went wrong
Well you're much too fat and a little too long
Hey hey, got too much to lose
Got to get on home to the animal zoo
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh no, something went wrong
Well you're much too fat and a little too long
Hey hey, got too much to lose
Got to get on home to the animal zoo
Oh no, something went wrong
Well you're much too fat and a little too long
Much to fat and a little to long
Much to fat and a little to long
