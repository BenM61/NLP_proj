We don't speak the same words
I'm lost, lost in the pages of a cold read of dis burst
It's something we don't know the meaning of
They go, go do what they want
I know oh she's not in love
Start low, lower feel it come
Oh yeah we know what they want

And it is what it was
Until you let it go
And it was what it is
Yeah you gotta let it go

Almost to much to be enough
I'm make it out somehow
I know your watching
Ah don't you miss it
When it was now

Drumbeat in your heart
You can't speak can't even stop to explain
Oh yeah we play the wrong game
They go, go do what they want
I know oh she's not in love
Start low, lower feel it come
Oh yeah we know what we want

And it is what it was
Until you let it go
And it was what it is
Yeah you gotta let it go

Almost to much to be enough
I'm make it out somehow
I know your watching
Ah don't you miss it
When it was now

Almost to much to be enough
I'm make it out somehow
I know your watching
Ah don't you miss it
When it was now

Don't have heart
Don't let em
Don't be fooled by what we say it
Sick like they know but they don't

Snow can't hurt
Don't let em
Don't be fooled by what we say it
Sick like they know but they don't

Almost to much to be enough
I'm make it out somehow
I know your watching
Ah don't you miss it
When it was now

Almost to much to be enough
I'm make it out somehow
I know your watching
Ah don't you miss it
When it was now
