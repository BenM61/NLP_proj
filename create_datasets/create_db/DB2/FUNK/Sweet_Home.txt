You needed help and I took you in
Because I was nice enough to be your friend
But now I know from the start when you walked in
You laid the cornerstone for a home in my heart

You built a home in my heart
I'll keep you here until we part
You gave my life a brand new start
When you built your home in my heart

You knocked on my door and I let you in
Now I know we're more than friends
I'll keep you here night and day
Your home in my heart is here to stay

Sweet, sweet, sweet home
Sweet, sweet, sweet home
Sweet, sweet, sweet home
Never again will I be alone

A home that's filled with nothin' but sunshine
A home that's filled with nothin' but care
Sweet sweet sweet home
One that both of us can share

Sweet, sweet, sweet home
Sweet, sweet, sweet home
Sweet, sweet, sweet home
I'm talkin' about a sweet home the night you came

Sweet, sweet, sweet home
Sweet, sweet, sweet home
Sweet, sweet, sweet home
I'm talkin' about a sweet home the night you came

Sweet, sweet, sweet home
Sweet, sweet, sweet home
Sweet, sweet, sweet home
I'm talkin' about a sweet home the night you came
