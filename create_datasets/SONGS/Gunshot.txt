I am longing for your poison
Like a cancer for it's prey
Shot an arrow, in your harbor
Where you waited in the rain
I am siren, I am ivy
I am no one, I'm nobody
I am longing for your honey
I am longing for your love

And the shot goes through my head and back
Gunshot, I can't take it back

Lay me down in your ocean
Carry me and my burden
I was dreaming about you honey
I was hoping you'd save me

And the shot goes through my head and back
Gunshot, I can't take it back
My heart cracked, really loved you bad
Gunshot, I'll never get you back

And I ache, while you're not here
I can feel you aching
Wide awake, why you're not here
I can feel you firing straight into my heart

Goes through my head and back
Gunshot, I can't take it back
My heart cracked, really loved you bad
Gunshot, I'll never get you back, never get you back
Never get you back, never get you back, never get you back
