I know you're from the South
I can tell from your back side
I'm from the slums
Let me show you how the 'Lac rides
Money ain't a thang baby

A young stunna but I'm sure you got your own money
The only time you see me runnin' baby if the po' comin'
Shawty lookin' good do that dance
I'm pretty sure you know I know what's in them pants
I'm a tease, shawty give me a chance
And if you like it now pop it and I'll leave in advance
Oh no shawty I don't play
I can tell from the slang you born and raised in the A
So I'm pretty sure I know where you stay
Baby, just hit me on the hip and I'll be headed your way
