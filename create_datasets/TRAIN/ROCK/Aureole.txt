Pale and ghost-like, the mist floats
Away from the stream, that through night and day
When I dream
Pours forth to the desolate darkness it's song
...All night long
Now the path of the morning sun is etched in earth
The birth of daylight
Aureole...
When viewed through the night-time haze
When cometh forth the rays
Aureole, I'm in a trance
Searching through memories of your radiance
The peak of the snow-capped giant
Is purpled in light
And the grass with the night dew
Is diamonded white
The stream...
Pours forth to the desolate darkness it's song
...All night long
Now the path of the morning sun is etched in earth
The birth of daylight
Aureole...
When viewed through the night-time haze
When cometh forth the rays
Aureole, I'm in a trance
Searching through memories of your radiance
