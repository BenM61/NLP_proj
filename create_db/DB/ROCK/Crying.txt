Gimme energy that's what I feel
Oh your blue eyes make it real
Love you in the rain like a crying game
Gimme energy oh can't you see

That your body's next to me
Love you in the rain like a crying game
Anything I want to do
Anything we'll rendez-vous

Oh love is good and good to me
Love is like a galaxy
Anything from wrong to right
Anything will turn into light

Love's good oh good to me 
Love is like a fantasy
Oh I'll be there in your heart
In the night and in the dark

Like a crying game - like a crying game
