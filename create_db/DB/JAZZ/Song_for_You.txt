I've been so many places
In my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs
I've made some bad rhymes

I've acted out my life in stages
With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now
And I'm singing this song for you

I know your image of me
Is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly
But girl can't you see,
There's no one more important to me
So darling can't you please see through me,
'Cause we're alone now
And I'm singing my song for you,

You taught me precious secrets
Of a true love withholding nothing,
You came out in front
When I was hiding,

Ooh but now its so much better
So if my words don't quite come together,
Listen to the melody
'Cause my love is in there hiding

I love you in a place
where there's no space or time,
I love you for my life
'Cause you're a friend of mine,

And when my life is over
Remember when we were together
And we were alone now,
And I was singing my song for you

And when my life is over
Remember when we were together
And we were alone now,
And I was singing my song for you

Woow for you
Mmm
