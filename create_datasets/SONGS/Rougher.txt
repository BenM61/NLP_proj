It isn't really so unfair
Forgive him if he didn't care
To live on nothing but thin air
Each message that he sent shot through
With on beyond old "how are you"
With on beyond old "I love you"

Promised me it would be rougher
Promised me he wouldn't love her

The feeling that we'd never meet
I left his letters on the street
At least the ones I thought to keep
I'm so not mad, it was so rare
Forgive him if he didn't care
To live on nothing but thin air

Promised me it would be rougher
Promised me he wouldn't love her
Promised me it would be rougher
Promised me he wouldn't love her
