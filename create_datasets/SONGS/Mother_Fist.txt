Well now I've been on my own for many a year
Seems like I'll never get loved
Got me a hand on this brother of mine
And I'm gonna get me the rub
Turn me the lights down to a purple glow
Put Bessie Smith on the wail
Bring me the five young daughters
And help my ship to set sail

Mother Fist never gets angry
Mother Fist she never gets bored
I don't have to feed her
I just have to need her
She cries give me the word

When I'm downtown in Barcelona
When I'm pissed or when I'm pissed off
Mother Fist just gives me her tender kiss
And some of her sexy stuff
And I lock my door from the inside
Turn my mind to sweet sweet pain
And I wail just like Yma Sumac
Mother Fist she never complains

Mother Fist never gets angry
Mother Fist she never gets bored
I don't have to feed her
I just have to need her
She cries give me the word

Now I don't care if I'm in a prison
In confinement solitary
A soldier lost in the legion
Or a sailor out on the sea
A beggar, thief or a rich man
A gunman mercenary
A one legged crook
An Armenian cook
As long as my mother's with me

Mother Fist never gets angry
Mother Fist she never gets bored
I don't have to feed her
I just have to need her
She cries give me the word
