Touch me again
I told you
In the end
You would never pass my way
Again
Again
Again

I said I said I'd never cry
You said you'd never lie
Here we are, here we go
Again
Again
Again

Round and round and round it goes
Where it stops
No one knows
Here we are, here we go
Again, oh no

Drifting away, day after day
Hole in my heart, won't go away
Drifting away, day after day
Hole in my heart, won't go away
Drifting away, day after day
Hole in my heart, won't go away
Drifting away, day after day
Hole in my heart, won't go away

Hit me again
No I told you
Near the end
You would never pass my way
Again
Again
Again

I said I'd never cry
You said you'd never lie
Here, yes, here we go
Again

Drifting away, day after day
Hole in my heart, won't go away
Drifting away, day after day
Hole in my heart, won't go away
Drifting away, day after day
Hole in my heart, won't go away
Drifting away, day after day
Hole in my heart, it won't go away, yeah
No!
