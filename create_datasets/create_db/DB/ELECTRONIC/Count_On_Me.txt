I know
I know
I know
I know
I will be there for you

All this love that I am giving
Can it ever be enough?
Let's go back to the beginning
Will it be the end of us?

Give me a sign
Tell me what you need
Tell me what you need
Throw my hands up high and surrender
You can count on me
You can count on me

I know
I know
I know
I know
I will be there for you

Cheating hearts, lying eyes, broken promises
I heard them all, but they never hurt like this
I'm in the dark when we're apart
And I miss the way you look right through me
No one else can move me

Give me a sign
Tell me what you need
Tell me what you need
Throw my hands up high and surrender
You can count on me
You can count on me

I know
I know
I know
I know
I will be there for you

Oh, baby
I, I
I, I
Oh, baby

I know
I know
I know
I know
I will be there for you

Give me a sign
Tell me what you need
Tell me what you need
Throw my hands up high and surrender
You can count on me
You can count on me

I know
I know
I know
I never knew what I could feel
I will be there for you

I know
We got each other, baby
I know
We got each other, baby
I know
We got each other, baby
I know
I will be there for you
