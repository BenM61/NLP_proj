Mile high club baby don't jump out the plane yet
Just might fall in love
I can tell the way you grip
Me, I don't even have to trip
Dripping so long I bet the neighbors know your name
Just might call the hotel maybe we should dip
Vegas, a wedding on the strip right now

(I wanna know, I wanna know)
I wanna know what would happen if we kiss right now
(I wanna know, I wanna know)
Right here and right now
(I wanna know, I wanna know)
Already know but I wanna be sure
Know that I wanna be yours
Right here and right now

On display
Just might fall
In a little trouble with the law
Ain't no tellin' what they saw
Windows up in the car all the way
Just might call the hotel, maybe we could get
A room then get kicked out again right now

(I wanna know, I wanna know)
I wanna know what would happen if we kiss right now
(I wanna know, I wanna know)
Right here and right now
(I wanna know, I wanna know)
Already know but I wanna be sure
Know that I wanna be yours
Right here and right now

We can wait if you want
We can stay if you want
I'll just say what you want
I can't wait anymore
I could stay kissing you
I just hate missing you
I might take it from you
I can't wait anymore

(I wanna know, I wanna know)
I wanna know what would happen if we kiss right now
(I wanna know, I wanna know)
Right here and right now
(I wanna know, I wanna know)
Already know but I wanna be sure
Know that I wanna be yours
Right here and right now
Right now
