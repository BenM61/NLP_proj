It's come down to just the two of us
Me and my shadow on the wall
Radio playing softly somewhere down the hall
And over in the next room
The hollow sound of a cigarette cough
Oh I'm sitting across from midnight
And morning's a long way off

There's a fire in a trash can
In the alley below
The down and outers gather round
Sippin' wine and talkin' low
We're companions of the night time
We got no place to go
Sittin' across from midnight
And time draggin' by too slow

You can feel the night when you're all alone
There's comfort in the room you keep hangin' on
You wait until the dawn

The skeletons in the closet
March around like a platoon
I guess it's too much to ask for
I need some breathing room
And the tall city buildings 
They cover up the moon 
Oh I'm sitting across from midnight
And morning can't come too soon

The early morning hours
Bring out the darkness of your thoughts 
And you're sitting across from midnight 
And morning a long way off
