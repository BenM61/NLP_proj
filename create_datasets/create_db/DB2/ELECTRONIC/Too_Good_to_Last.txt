You could have saved my life
You could have brought me love
You could have been so right
You fitted me like a glove

You could have been the sun
That shone on me every day
You could have been the one
To take me away

But you were too good to last
Baby you were too good to last
The one you love was in the looking glass
And you were too good to last
Oh yeah too good to last
You're too good to last
The one you love was in the looking glass
And you were too good to last
