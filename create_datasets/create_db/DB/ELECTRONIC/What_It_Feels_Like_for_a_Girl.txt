Girls can wear jeans, cut their hair short
Wear shirts and boots 'cause it's okay to be a boy
But for a boy to look like a girl is degrading
'Cause you think that being a girl is degrading

But secretly you'd love to know what it's like
Wouldn't you? What it feels like for a girl

For a girl in this world
For a girl in this world
For a girl in this world
For a girl in this world

Do you know what it feels like for a girl
Do you know what it feels like in this world for a girl
Do you know what it feels like for a girl
Do you know what it feels like in this world

For a girl in this world
For a girl in this world
For a girl in this world
For a girl
For a girl
