What did I see in you, have changed my mind
Those first impressions saying love is blind
Why find a reason when this feeling goes on and on
In everyone swept into the tide

Heaven can wait forever
Now till the end of time
Heaven can wait forever
Now I know you're mine

Two lonely people that are locked in time
Wait for the moment the perfect crime
Reaching out to steal your heart in the dark
We fade away and dream to stay in this world we tried

Heaven can wait forever
Now till the end of time
Heaven can wait forever
Now I know you're mine

This feeling I got swept into the tide, yeah
Reaching out to steal your heart in the dark we fade

Heaven can wait forever
Now till the end of time
Heaven can wait forever
Now I know you're mine
Now that I've got you by my side

Heaven can wait forever
Now till the end of time
Heaven can wait forever
Now that I got you by my side

Heaven, I got you here
I got a (Incomprehensible), yeah yeah
Ain't nothing like (Incomprehensible)
Ain't nothing that I'd ever miss
