" There was the stage
Two red lights and a Dodgy P.A
You trod the planks way back then
And it's strange that you're
Here again - here again "

" And I wish , I wish I knew the right words
to make you feel better
Walk out of this place
Defeat them in your secret battle
Show them you can be your own man again "

" Don't, don't explain
Lots of little victories take on the pain
It takes so long to earn
You can double up or
You can burn - You can burn "

" And I wish, I wish I knew the right words
To make you feel better
Walk out of this place
Defeat them in your secret battle
Show them you can be your own man again "

" And I wish, I wish I knew the right words
To blow up the Pokies and
Drag them away
'Cause they're taking the food off your table
So they can say that the trains run on time "

" Flashing lights - It's a real show
And your wife - I wouldn't go home
The little bundles need care
And you can't be a father there
Father there "

" And I wish, I wish I knew the right words
To blow up the Pokies and
Drag them away
'Cause they're taking the food off your table
So they can say that the trains run on time "
