We had our chance
Lord knows how we tried
To keep our love alive
To keep it strong
So if i hurt you girl
Try and understand
You can't go on pretending
When we know it's ending

Blame it on love
On the memories that linger in the night
Love never showed us how to make it right
So baby
Blame it on love tonight

We had our time
It went by so fast
We tried to make it last
To make it right

We gave it all we had
Girl don't look so sad
Let's go out remembering a happier ending

Blame it on love
On the memories that linger in the night
Love never showed us how to make it right
So baby (so baby)
Blame it on love tonight

There ain't no use in harping on
Girl it's time to let it be
We did all we could
And it won't do no good
To blame it on you and me

Blame it on love
On the dreams we shared that won't come true
On the feeling that our love would always see us through

So baby, (so baby) let's blame it on love tonight

We can blame it on love
On the dreams we shared that won't come true
On the feeling that our love would always see us through
