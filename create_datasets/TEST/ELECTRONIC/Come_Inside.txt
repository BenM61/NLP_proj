I can't find my way out of this place
I'm crawling on the floor
If the party's over, why won't you tell me?
I don't see you dancing any more

Well when all the doors are open wide
I'll be yours and maybe you'll be mine
So close your eyes; kiss the sky
The door is open won't ya come inside

Well can you hear the wind? It's telling lies
It happens all the time
Can you see the faces, seraphim eyes
They make me want to cry

Well when all the doors are open wide
I'll be yours and maybe you'll be mine
So close your eyes; kiss the sky
The door is open won't ya come inside

Come inside, come inside
Well, I could dive in deep or float on by
It doesn't matter to me, no
''cause one way or another
I'm gonna get myself right out of this dream

When all the doors are open wide
I'll be yours and maybe you'll be mine
So cover your eyes; kiss the sky
The door is open, so come inside
