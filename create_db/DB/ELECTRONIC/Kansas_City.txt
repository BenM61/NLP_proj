When you're coming home and it?s getting late
I was unwritten fate
Two eyes light up the screen
Ooh, the prettiest face you?ve ever seen
You-ooh in the depleting light
Tip-toe through in the middle of the night
You say ?I want what you got? ohh
And the rocket launch starts the show

(Chorus)
Somebody in Kansas City loves me
Somebody is waiting by the telephone
Somebody in Kansas City loves me
Somebody is waiting too all alone

Hey,
Now listen
I?m a figure of eight
You can catch me and y?all wouldn?t choose
But clock is ticking 1,2,3,4,5 I?m late
Oh I, forgot to mention
He?s like that thin man with the big heart
It ?aint easy
He loves me
And the rocket launch starts the show

(Chorus)
Somebody in Kansas City loves me
Somebody is waiting by the telephone
Somebody in Kansas City loves me
Somebody is waiting to all alone

Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh
Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh

Oh Oh (somebody)
Oh Oh (somebody)
Oh Oh (somebody in Kansas City)
Oh Oh (somebody)
Oh Oh (somebody)
Oh Oh (somebody in Kansas City)

(Chorus)
Somebody in Kansas City loves me
Somebody is waiting by the telephone
Somebody in Kansas City loves me
Somebody is waiting too all alone

Alone (somebody)
Oh Oh (somebody)
Oh Oh (in Kansas City)
Oh Oh (somebody)
Oh Oh (somebody)
Oh Oh (loves me, loves me)
Oh Oh (somebody)
Oh Oh (somebody)
Oh Oh (in Kansas City, Kansas City)
Oh Oh (somebody)
Oh Oh (somebody)
Oh Oh (loves me, loves me)
(fade out)
