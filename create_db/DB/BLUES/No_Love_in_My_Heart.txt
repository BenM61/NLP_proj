You're just like the devil,
No love in my heart for you
You're just like the devil,
No love in my heart for you
I'm goin' back home,
Nothin' I can do with you

I'm goin' back home,
Tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm goin' back home,
Tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna get me another woman,
Because I can't use you

I was a fool,
To believe what you said
I was a fool,
To believe what you said
Now I'm tired of you treatin' me,
Like some bum lookin' bad

Oh Bye
