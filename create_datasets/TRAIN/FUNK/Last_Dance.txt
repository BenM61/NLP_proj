Last dance
Last chance, for love
Yes, it's my last chance, for romance, tonight

I need you, by me,
Beside me, to guide me,
To hold me, to scold me, 
'Cause when I'm bad
I'm so' so bad

So let's dance, the last dance
Let's dance, the last dance
Let's dance, this last dance tonight

Last dance, last chance for love
Yes it's my last chance
For romance tonight

Beside me, to guide,
To hold me, to scold me,
'Cause when I'm bad
I'm so, so bad

So let's dance, the last dance
Let's dance, the last dance
Let's dance, this last dance tonight

Yeah, will you be my Mr. Right?
Can you fill my appetite
I can't be sure that you're the one for me
But all that I ask is that you dance with me
Dance with me, Dance with me, yeah

Oh I need you, by me,
Beside me, to guide me,
To hold me, to scold me,
'Cause when I'm bad
I'm so, so bad

So let's dance, this last dance
Let's dance, this last dance
Let's dance' this last dance tonight

Oh I need you, by me,
Beside me, to guide me,
To hold me, to scold me,
'Cause when I'm bad
I'm so, so horny

So, come on baby, dance that dance
Come on baby, dance that dance
Come on baby, let's dance tonight
