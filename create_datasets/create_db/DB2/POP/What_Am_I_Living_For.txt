What am I living for
If not for you
Tell me what am I living for
If not for you

Girl, what am I living for
If not for you
Whoa, oh, nobody else, baby
Nobody else will do

What am I longing for
Each lonely night,
To feel your lips to mine
And hold you tight

Yes, you'll be the only girl
My whole life through
Oh, nobody, baby
Nobody else will do

I want you close to me
That's all I know
I want you all the time
Darling, I love you so

What am I living for
If not for you
Tell me what am I living for
If not for you

I wanna know
What am I living for
What am I living for
If not for you
Oh, darling, nobody else
Nobody else will do

Oh, pick it, son

I want you close to me
That's all I know
I want you all the time
Because I love you so

Girl, what am I living for
If not for you
Tell me what am I living for
If not for you

What am I living for
If not for you
Oh, oh, nobody else, baby
Nobody else will do

Oh, oh, nobody, nobody, baby
Nobody else will do
