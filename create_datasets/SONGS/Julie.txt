Julie was a lonely girl
She said she was born that way 
She always felt that way 
She left home at age sixteen 

Got a job what you're supposed to do 
That's what you've got to do 
She fell in love and settled down 
In a council place there on the edge of town 

She'd feel alone in a crowded room 
Cry when she heard a happy tune 
It would be nice to holiday 
Till they took her job away 

They just took her life away 
Doing nothing isn't fun 
When you've nothing from which to run 
You've nowhere left to run 

She'd visit the social every day 
Every time be turned away 
Every time be turned away 
She'd feel alone in a crowded room 

Cry when she heard a happy tune 
Julie waits, her world is her window 
And Julie hates, she hates the world below 
A hundred stairs to her new room 

Over glass and blackened spoons 
Children grow old so soon
Past the kids who gather there 
Pain masked by narcotic stares 

But no one really cares 
Her dreams were cut up and bled dry 
A million voices in her cry 
Julie waits, her world is her window 

And Julie hates, she hates the world below 
And Julie hates, just what she doesn't know 
But Julie loves, 
She loves too much to know
