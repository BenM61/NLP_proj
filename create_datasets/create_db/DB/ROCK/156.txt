From my boat I can see your house
And when the lights are off
I can watch you move
Hear the wind whispering your name

Twice the encouragement 
Of the real you
Callie if you really want me to
I can always get you down

If you get the money for me
Callie in the summer rain
You will be kept dry you see
If you got the money for me

Making amends for distant wrong
Sincere
You can run away
Leave your books behind you

But you should look back twise
Just to be on the save side
From my boat I can see your house
But now the lights are off

And there is no one home
You are just like an avalanche
Cold as I might have guessed
But at least I'm covered up for now

In a big, big way
I am really small
I get off my feet
But I'm still distant

Don't you just love goodbyes?
Callie let us get it over with
I can always get you down
If you got the money for me

Callie in the summer rain
You will be kept dry you see
If you got the money for me
Most of our lives we try so hard

To find the time
I won't care for you
Like I'm really supposed to
There are things I'll do

That could really hurt you
Don't you just love goodbyes?
