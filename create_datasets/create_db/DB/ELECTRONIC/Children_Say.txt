I keep to myself 
what I might share with others 
but they don't seem to understand 
I open my mouth 
to rediscover 
that I don't have the words at my command 
holding out 
for a world so much better 
but I'm a stranger in a stranger's land 
all my friends have sold out 
couldn't handle the pressure 
counting their blessings trying to salvage what they can 

Children say - children say 
we open our minds as one 
but one more day - slips away 
why don't the dreams of the young never come to be 

When I overhear 
my parents conversations 
well I'm struck by the things they say 
it seems they traded the years 
for mere complications 
who ever thought it could end this way 
they close the door 
but they can't lock it 
'cause something of their childhood remains 
and they've felt it before 
when the man in their pocket 
counted the cost of their material gains 

Children say - come what may 
be strong for the friends you've known 
but one fine day - (not) far away 
will we remember the love we used to own 
Children say - children say 
we open our minds as one 
as one more day slips away 
why don't the dreams of the young never come to be 

Well you knew what I was saying 
but did you know what it meant 
when you saw that look in my eye 
did you know it was heaven sent 
was it all a waking dream 
all that time we must have spetn 
well I guess it must have been 
somehow that feeling came and went 

Children say - come what may 
be strong for the friends you've known 
but one fine day - (not) far away 
will we remember the love we used to own 
Children say - children say 
we open our minds as one 
as one more day - slips away 
why don't the dreams of the young never come to be 
Children say - children say 
we thought it would never go 
as one more day - slips away 
who ever thought we could be so lonely
