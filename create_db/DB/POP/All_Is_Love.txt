One, two, ready, go
Grow some big feet, holes in history
Is where you’ll find me, is where you’ll find
All is love, is love, is love, is love

L.O.V.E, it’s a mystery
Where you’ll find me, where you’ll find
All is Love, is love, is love, is love

Hey, ooh
Hey, ooh
Ooh ooh
All is Love

One, two, ready, go
L.O.V.E, it’s a mystery
Where you’ll find me, where you’ll find
All is love, is love, is love, is love

Ooh ooh…
All is Love, is love, is love, is love…
