Hey, coloured kisses
The red, blue, yellow, green
Black and white are the colours you liked

Red, the fire that burns my heart
When you're near, it wraps me up
Now, I find the space to feel good
Like the water it fills me with peace
When you near me again I still breathe within

Now that you're at my side
Your soul in mine
But I long for your touch
It's hurting so much

You give me, give me coloured kisses
Coloured kisses for my lips to taste
You lead me, lead me to an oasis
An oasis where I can lay
My head on your shoulder and pray

What else can I do?
'Cause all I want is more and more
Coloured kisses from you
Coloured kisses

Yellow is the sun that shines on me
Like your smile it sets me free
Seasons change to blacken my mood
When I falter my heart goes astray
I remember the nights when you'd take me away

Because when I'm at your arm
I'm safe and warm
But I'm never alone
Because my heart is your home

You give me, give me coloured kisses
Coloured kisses for my lips to taste
You lead me, lead me to an oasis
An oasis where I can lay
My head on your shoulder and pray

And that no one can take me from you
And no one can break us in two
So lift it up in the clouds set me free
And let your rainbow all out shine on me

Coloured kisses
Coloured kisses
That's right
Come back, come back, come back

You, you give me
Coloured, coloured kisses for my lips to taste
You lead me, lead me to an oasis
An oasis where I can lay
My head on your shoulder and pray
What else can I do?

You give me, give me coloured kisses
Coloured kisses to taste
You lead me, lead me to an oasis
An oasis where I can lay
My head on your shoulder and pray
What else can I do?
