Now I need your touch tonight
Nobody else will do
The time is right
Love's a game and we're both in it

Playin' for real, we will win it
Gonna show them how it's meant to be
We're gonna make it together
We're gonna tear it up

Take it to the limit girl
We're gonna make it together
We're gonna tear it up
Never see the finish

Now tomorrow seems so bright
The future's lookin' good for us
We have a chance
If our faith is true and we don't break it

No one else could ever shake it
What we have will last eternally
True love forever, shine your light this way
And we'll stay together

Passion is all it takes to make it real
And it's what we're feelin'
