ecause I love you more, than words can ever say , 
I can live again,  with no regrets of dreams that died, before you came
because I know this time , this love is really mine ,
I can love again and touch the stars that seem so very far away
far , there's a world for us to find
far beyond the rainbow's light
and new horizons everyday , with love to guide us all the way
 eternally eternally
because you came to me ,  with all I dream to see ,  I can live again 
with no regrets , for all I gave before you came
far ,  there's a world for us to find , far ,  beyond the rainbow's light 
and new horizons everyday with love to guide us all the way
 eternally eternally
far , there's a world for us to find , far beyoind the rainbow's light 
 and new horizons everyday with love to guide us all the way
eternally eternally
