After sometimes I've finally made up my mind
She is the girl and I really want to make her mine
I'm searching everywhere to find her again
To tell her I love her
And I'm sorry 'bout the things I've done
I find her standing in front of the church
The only place in town where I didn't search
She looks so happy in her wedding dress
But she's crying while she's saying this

Boy I missed your kisses all the time but
This is twenty five minutes too late
Though travelled so far
Boy I'm sorry you are
Twenty five minutes too late

Against the wind I'm going home again
Wishing me back to time when we were more than friends
But I still see her in front of the church
The only place in town where I didn't search
She looked so happy in her wedding dress
But she's cried while she was saying this

Boy I missed your kisses all the time but
This is twenty five minutes too late
Though travelled so far
Boy I'm sorry you are
Twenty five minutes too late

Out in the streets
Places where hungry hearts have nothing to eat
Inside my head still I can hear the words she said

Boy I missed your kisses all the time but
This is twentyfive minutes too late
Though travelled so far
Boy I'm sorry you are
Twenty five minutes too late

Boy I missed your kisses all the time but
This is twentyfive minutes too late
Though travelled so far
Boy I'm sorry you are
Twenty five minutes too late

I can still hear her say
