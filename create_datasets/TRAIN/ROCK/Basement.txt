Color-coded blasphemy
This really strange anatomy
Is this really my life?
Something isn't right
The ambiguity
This whole damn conspiracy
Playing out in my head
Something isn't right

I never wanted this
I never asked for it
But this is what you gave me
I never wanted this
I never asked for it

Stranger than a massacre
This homicidal afterbirth
I am not a stranger 
To living with the anger
I don't need a miracle
I just need a place to go
Send me to the angels
And tell god I said goodbye

I never wanted this
I never asked for it
But this is what you gave me
I never wanted this
I never asked for it
But this is what you gave me

I could care less about the world sometimes
A certain inspiration takes me to the afterlife
I'll see you on the other side

Nothing ever takes away the shit that I see every day
With total inconsistencies, so f*ck the whole conspiracy
So long. I'm fucking gone!

I never wanted this
I never asked for it
But this is what you gave me
I never wanted this
I never asked for it
But this is what you gave me
Why would you forsake me?
