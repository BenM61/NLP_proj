Mary Call, Mary Call
You never stumble, you never fall
Silver stars and lilies call
For the yearning of a young one
Named Mary Call
She's the treasure of the mountains
And the dearest one of all

Papa's gone and mama too
This life has been quite cruel to you
But spirit took you from the start
It made you brave and it gave you heart
Brothers and sisters by your side
You worked so hard that the earth took pride
It gave you sage, wild thyme and rue
To earn your keep, to pull you through

Mary Call, Mary Call
You stand so straight and you stand so tall
Winds will sweep and rivers fall
For the yearning of a young one
Named Mary Call
She's the treasure of the mountains
And the dearest one of all

When you finally met despair
A kindly man came to your care
He held you in his arms and said
"Just dry your tears and rest your head"
Too tired to argue or protest
You realized you'd done your best
There'll be a place for you somewhere
To tie bright ribbons through your hair

Mary Call, Mary Call
You never stumble, you never fall
Silver stars and lilies call
For the yearning of a young one
Named Mary Call
She's the treasure of the mountains
And the dearest one of all

Mary Call, Mary Call
You stand so straight and you stand so tall
Winds will sweep and rivers fall
For the yearning of a young one
Named Mary Call
She's the treasure of the mountains
And the dearest one of all
