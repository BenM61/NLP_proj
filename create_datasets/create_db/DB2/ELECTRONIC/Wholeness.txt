How can I learn to let go, 
Now that you have shown 
That you are strong enough,
But I am not

How can I let the world rough you around 
When I'm not there,
I can't protect you
Why does life have to rob you of your 

Innocence and faith 
For you to be a grown up?
The only thing that gives me strength 
When I am deep in doubt 
Is your nature

Oh, how you damage me
You never mean to
Oh, how you break my heart
And make me need you

Oh, you can crush me
Like a rose petal
Oh, how you damage me
You never mean to
