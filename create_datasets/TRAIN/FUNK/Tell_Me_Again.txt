(wintley phipps)

You alone know how I feel down deep inside
I promised you I'll never stray from by your side
But now I'm looking back on all those yesterdays
The many times I let you down
I'm begging I can hear you say

Tell me again that you love me
And you'll love me till the stars fall from the sky
Tell me again that you love me
And the love you have for me will never die

I can tell when first we start to drift apart
The emptiness just takes hold of my wounded heart
You know I need to feel you by my side
'cause when the night is cold and I've been so bold
There's no need to hide

Just tell me again that you love me
That you'll love me till the stars fall from the sky
Tell me again that you love me
And the love you have for me will never die

And if you light the way
I will follow you into that land of gladness
No more sadness

Tell me again that you love me
That you'll love me till the stars fall from the sky
Tell me again that you love me
And the love you have for me
The love you have for me will never die
