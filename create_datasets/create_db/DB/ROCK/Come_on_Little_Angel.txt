Come on little angel won't you dance with me,
Well at last I know you know it was plain to see,
We did the Mashed Potato and it sure was fun,
Now ev'rybody wants to see the way it was done, now,
Come on little angel hear the band playing loud,
Turn around see them forming a crowd,
And now, little angel, now that you're in the groove
You hear them all a-clapping as we both start to move.
Now, come on, come on little angel, come on,
Come on little angel, come on.
Come on little angel, come on, come on.

Come on little angel now the lights are down low,
It's really getting late and we have to go,
Well thank you little angel for that wonderful kiss
And now you're gonna tell me that you're doing the Twist.

Around and around and up and down,
Around and around and up and down,
Around and around and up and down,
Around and around and up and down.

Yes, little angel, it sure is fun,
Ev'ry time we're dancin' she's a-right on time.
She moves to the left, she moves to the right,
She feels the beat and she dances all the night.

Why don't you come on little angel now the lights are down low,
It's really getting late and now we have to go,
Well thank you little angel for that wonderful kiss
And now you're gonna tell me that you're doing the Twist.

Around and around and up and down
