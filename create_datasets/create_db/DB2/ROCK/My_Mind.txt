Stepping steps of floating floats
That float above such shining notes
They know just where we should rest

Policed and waiting patiently
We knew where we'd gone and where we'd be
We know this should never drown the seeds
(Just where their feet are moving
Just why why their feet are moving.)

My mind is all
My mind is all
My mind is all gone
My mind is all
My mind is all
My mind is all gone

Deaf and dumb but fluent speech
Speaking speaks and listening
While eating piled tangled sugar weaves
(Just where their feet are moving
Just why why their feet are moving.)

My mind is all
My mind is all
My mind is all gone
My mind is all
My mind is all
My mind is all gone

You are my hands, do as I please
I feel my body moving, I feel these feet a-moving
You are my hands, do as I please
I feel my body moving, I feel these feet a-moving

A messy mess of fruits and pies
That dance about these aging eyes
They know just what becomes of seeds
(Just where their feet are moving
Just why why their feet are moving.)
A busy suit of dirty boys
Feeling rude in lazy lies
Oh my, my, my
Oh, my, my, my my

My mind is all
My mind is all
My mind is all
You are my hands, do as I please
I feel my body moving, I feel these feet a-moving
(My mind is all
My mind is all
My mind is all)
You are my hands, do as I please
I feel my body moving, I feel these feet a-moving
(My mind is all
My mind is all
My mind is all)
You are my hands, do as I please
I feel my body moving, I feel these feet a-moving
