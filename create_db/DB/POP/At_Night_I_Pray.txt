So alone
And this room feels so cold
No one to care and no one to hold
Yeah the lord knows
That I'm needing somebody like you, just like you
Can you see
The passion burning in my eyes
Do you sense
The rush you give my heart
And if you knew
The secret way I feel for you
Would you come running
To me or would you turn away

At night I pray
With hope and faith
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray together we will be
And there will come a time
You'll be mine, all mine
And I'll be yours always
But until that day comes at night I'll pray

Should I feel
These emotions deep inside me
Should I reveal what's locked up in my soul
I'm so afraid
But it's something that you've got to know
How I want
To touch you every time you're near
I long to feel
Your body next to mine
And if you knew
The secret love I have for you
Would you come running to me or would you turn away

If all my prayers were answered
Our hearts would be enraptured
We would find our heaven
Inside each other's arms
This lonely room would finally see the sun shine through
But until that day every night I'll pray
I'll get down on my knees, I'll get down on my knees and pray
