It's young Khalifa, you know what it is

You're the realest of them all, I say without a doubt
Always been my lucky charm, girl, when my luck runs out
Gold and diamonds don't mean anything when you're my wealth
Yeah, you worth the whole world to me, no, you worth more

Gimme the sugar I need, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know you look up to me, yeah, yeah, yeah
What would I do without you? Girl, all I know
