Father John and his keep
Preachin' to the women on the easy street for free
Roll over again (Give me drum)
Through the years
Plyin' his trade
Lookin' for heaven on a silver plate
Roll over again 
If only he knew it didn't have to be that way
Oh, the promised land
Is just another slice of the cake 

Round and round,
It's always round and round we go (Round and round we go)
Yeah, where it leads us
Nobody knows (Nobody)
No, no, 
Dance and dance 
Why must we dance our lives away (Dance our lives away)
How much it bleeds us
No-one can say (Say say say say) 

Jezebel made her way,
Sliding around on dirty sheets all day
So roll over again (1, 2, 3, 4)
She lived for years
With the fear
That real true love might never come her way
Roll over again 
If only she knew it didn't have to be that way
Yeah, if true romance 
Was just another slice of the cake 

Round and round,
It's always round and round we go (Round and round we go)
Yeah, where it leads us
Nobody knows (Nobody)
No, no, 
Dance and dance 
Why must we dance our lives away (Dance our lives away)
How much it bleeds us
No-one can say (Say say say say) 

You and me,
Chasing dreams
We can't see the forest for the trees
We roll over again (Yeah)
You and me
Dance so well
Just like John and Jezebel
We roll over again (Whoa-oh-oh-oh, let's dance!) 

Round and round,
It's always round and round we go (Round and round we go)
Yeah, where it leads us
Nobody knows (Nobody)
No, no, 
Dance and dance 
Why must we dance our lives away (Dance our lives away)
How much it bleeds us
No-one can say (Say say say say) 

No one can say
