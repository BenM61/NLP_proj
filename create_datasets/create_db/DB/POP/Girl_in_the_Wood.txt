Oh when I was a young boy 
And drove my mother wild
I met a maiden in the woods
And she said child

Look deep into my green eyes 
And at my autumn hair 
When your a man you'll never see a girl
Quite as fair

Remember me oh remember me

Her eyes were green as grassy pools
Lookin right at me
Her hair was red and grown with leaves
Just like an autumn tree

She moved her tiny hands 
And she made a litle turn
She swayed in the wind
Just like a graceful fern

I swore as she vanished 
That when I was full grown
I'd have a girl just like her
To be my very own

And now I am a man
And I'd marry if I could
But I can't lose the memory
Of the girl in the wood 

Remember me oh remember me

Remember for the rest of your life

I wished a hundred times 
That she'd never looked at me 
With the first wild beauty
They only you'd can't see

For man cannot find it
When he's lookin' for a wife
And he'll end up in bachelor hood
The rest of his life
Remember me oh remember me

Remember for the rest of your life

Remember for the rest of your life
