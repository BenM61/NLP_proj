Only Silence remains, 
Because (we) have to listen to Him, 
Have to listen to the silence have to experience Him

Fall over myself 
Don't mean to interrupt
I was not sleeping
Things I forgot
The footstool of God
That's how I feel it
I've righted myself
And folded my hands
As you've talked to God

I love the way you dream
I love the way you dream
I love the way you dream

I love the way you dream
I love the way you dream
I love the way you dream

I love the way you dream
I love the way you dream
I love the way you dream

Even my most base come play my sweet
My instrument
And even all my restraint my sweet
My aim is clumsy
And even if there's only one thing I want for you
I want for you

I love the way you dream
I love the way you dream
I love the way you dream

I love the way you love the way you dream
Want for you want for me
Want for you want for me
Want for you

Even if there's only one thing I want for you
I love the way you love the way you dream
Want for you want for me
Want for you want for me
Want for you

Dream dream dream
Dream dream dream
