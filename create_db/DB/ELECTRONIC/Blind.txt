I think of you like I often do
When I hear the rain on my windowpane
Gently tapping at the glass 
Like your gently touching fingers
Just looking for the smile I give to you

[Chorus]
You can feel what no one feels
You can hear what no one hears
Just looking for the smile I give to you
You can feel what no one feels
You can hear what no one wants to hear
Just looking for the smile I give to you

Your darkness speaks and has eyes to see
and you know me by my voice 
But you know so much more than
"Don't fight the walls they're here for all"
Is what you said to me once
I looked into your eyes and I knew you were right

[Chorus]

And your darkness speaks and has eyes to see
I know you can win this life long game we're in 
"Hey darkness is a state of mind 
I can go where you would stumble"
Is what you said to me and I knew you we right
