Hottest
Finest

Everybody want to be
Wearing jewellery
Escaping reality
Runnin' the city
So ya want to be number one
Don't forget where ya came from
Its not about me and you 
It's about the things we do 
Most guys don't have a clue
Material issues 

How can I make you see the real things in life are free

Hottest 
Finest 

We don't need someone
That could show you what you loving
Need someone
That'll neva let you down
Need someone
To tell you that they love you
And always be around

You could be the hottest 
You could be the finest
It don't matter to me
You could be the baddest
Be the most stylish
You could be rollin' in money
It don't matter what you got
If your heart is outta love 
You could be the hottest 
You could be the finest
It don't matter to me

Outta my ? things
Wouldn't mind a diamond ring
But trust me I'd be chippin' in
And take what life brings
Gotta do what you decide
But do what feels right
I just want to keep it real
That just how I feel
Its not about the ?
But the R-E-S-P-E-C-T

How can I make you see the real things in life are free
