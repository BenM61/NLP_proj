Change been da same 
Growing pains 
Since love begun da game 
Thangs do they thang 
Through the strain 
To the plane they're born to be 
Harmony of Diversity 
Sing responsibility 
(from you & me) 
Sankofa! 
Stand for yours! 
Unite Humanity 
(for you & me) 

Know (grow show) 
Pure Love 
Revolution just Evolution 
This war zone is not a home 
Grow and Show 
Pure Love 
Revolution just Evolution 

Bless our sisters, fathers, 
Mothers, brothers, (steve Bikos) 
Who press us ahead of schools 
Taught us right been 
Condemned to win 
And said keep the golden rule 
(show unto others pure love, children) 
Harmony of our Diversity 
Means accoutability 
The sacrifice been paid 
The price, 'nuff blood shed 
To beg us to see 
(be true indeed, true indeed, yeah) 

Affirmative 
Action Attack 
Social Welfare Cutbacks 
Klans without hats runnin' prison camps 
Peelin' Caps 
Of Mumia's, Gonzolo's, Peltier's & Geronimo Pratts 
Beat down and shot in the back 
Over some don't cross the border crap 
Now how we act 
Ain't up to us 
If truly be in God we trust 
But must we stand for the lust 
To make our ducs and live 
Big up Rauf-Move ona Move 
Ya dig 
Revolution
