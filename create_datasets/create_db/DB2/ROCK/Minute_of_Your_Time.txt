I've got a good position here. my boss is proud of me
He said so in a letter that he wrote the other week
My parents too are happy. which is nice
For without their encouragement I never would have tried
But now much to their horror. I've decided I might quit
What's the point of working hard when I can hardly live
The key to my survival lies with you
Don't ask me what you've got. I only know that while you do
For a minute of your time, a minute of your time
I would gladly go with you anywhere
For a minute of your time. a minute of your time
I'd be happy in despair

It's funny how our lives are mapped out in a certain way
Call it fatalistic if you want to that's okay
The point I'm trying to make. is. as a rule
An error on your part can be a costly one for you
But looking back how often have you thought. well I'll be blowed
If it wasn't for that error. I'd be on a different road
Which leads me very nicely round to you
You know how much I love you and until you love me too

For a minute of your time a minute of your time
I would gladly go with you anywhere
For a minute of your time. a minute of your time
I'd be happy in despair
For a minute of your time. a minute of your time
Even though it may not seem that long to you
For a minute of your time. a minute of your time
Even less for me would do

I don't suppose you'd ever think of moving in with me
Lots of people do it. it's quite common I believe
This may come as a shock. even to you
But I'm the one who feels this way and here's what I would do
For a minute of your time. etc.
