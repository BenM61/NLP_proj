Pera menora infane lia
Doven anore 
Misere mani

I will look in the sky
I will search for the sun 
Who'll tell us all about
Where we'll be tomorrow 

I will read all the books
Of many continents
To tell you all about
The legends of the past 

I will wait for the sun
On top of the world
To tell you all about
The beauty of the light

If you look inside your soul
The world'll open to your eyes
You'll see...

I will stand in the rain
Hoping sun will come through
Then I'll see it belongs to a misty rainbow
I'll stay up in the night
Looking on shooting stars
To tell you that magic
Is the all universe

If you look inside your soul
The world'll open to your eyes
You'll see...

Pera menora infano lia
Misere mani
Doven anore infane lia
Misere manio
Doven anore infane lia 
Misero omane

Pera menora infane lia
You'll see...
Doven anore 
Misere mani

I will wait for the sun
On top of the world
To tell you all about
The beauty of the light
I'll stay up in the night
Looking on shooting stars

Doven anore infane lia
Misere manio
Doven anore infane lia 
Misero omane

I will look in the sky
I will search for the sun 
I will wait for the sun
On top of the world
I will look in the sky
of the world, of the world ...
