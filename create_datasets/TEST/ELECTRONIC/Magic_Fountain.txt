In the beginning
There was a fountain
But it wasn't just any fountain
It was a fountain of light 
It was a fountain of truth
It was a fountain of dreams
It was a fountain of youth
It was a magic magic magic magic magic magic magic magic fountain
 
And we were never told
That the fountain was a trophy for the kingdoms of old
A treasure a plaything a trojan in disguise
And in the last great war the secret burned up in the fire
While the peasants stood on mountain tops pretending to be kings
And the king holed up and never losed was doing idle things
Transgress the Himalayas in the night hahahahaha yeah right
It was a magic magic magic magic
Magic magic magic magic (act...)
 
And so it was some motley crew who found it in the night
One of them a lunatic told me of his plight
One dived to the left of him two went to the right
But he remained he said he saw he said he saw the light
And it was magic fountain magic fountain magic fountain magic magic
