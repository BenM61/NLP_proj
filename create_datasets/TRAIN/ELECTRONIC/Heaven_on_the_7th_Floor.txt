"Goin' up" she said uh huh
Just as we were startin' to climb together
Oh oh lookin' up I said uh huh
"Maybe I could see you tonight?"
She said "never!"
ooh ooh I was out of luck
But ten seconds later somehow we got stuck in that elevator
Heaven on the 7th floor
(Hey baby)
Heaven on the 7th floor
(I ain't complainin')
But I've never been so high before
So please don't rescue me
Never set me free
Hey, hey, hey

"We're alone" I said uh huh
Looks like we could be here all night
Together ooh ooh
"There's a phone" she said uh huh
Gonna have us out in five minutes' time whatever
"Please could you make it ten" I told the operator
I'm havin' so much fun in this elevator

And as the Musak played sooner or later I knew
We'd fall in love in that elevator
