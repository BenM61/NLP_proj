Day after day 
I feel like giving up (yes I do)
I lived your way Was that good enough (not for you)

You've got to point your finger 
You think you know it all 
I want you to remember 
I don't live for you 
'Cause I'm against your laws 

Can you hear me 
I've just got to say (one thing more) 
I'll say it clearly 
Stay out of my way (that's for sure) 

You've got to point your finger 
You think you know it all 
I want you to remember 
I don't live for you 
'Cause I'm against your laws 

We've still got the fire 
Burning in our souls 
But we're just rockin' harder 
To make our music roll 

You've got to point your finger 
You think you know it all 
I want you to remember 
I don't live for you 
'Cause I'm against your laws
