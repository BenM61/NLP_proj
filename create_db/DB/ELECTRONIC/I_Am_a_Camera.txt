Memories how they fade so fast
Look back there is no escape
Tied down now you see too late
Lovers they will never wait
I am a camera
I am a camera
Take heart I will never let you go
If you want to let your feelings show
Lovers all how they never broke your heart
You lose them if the feeling starts
I am a camera camera camera
I am a camera camera camera
There by the waterside
Here where the lens is wide
You and me by the sea
Taken in tranquility
Take heart I will never let you go
If you want to let your feelings show
Lovers all how they never broke your heart
You lose them if the feeling starts
I am I am a camera
I am a camera I am a camera
I am I am a camera
I am a camera I am a camera
There by the waterside
Here where the lens is wide
You and me by the sea
