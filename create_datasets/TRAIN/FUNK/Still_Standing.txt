Mama always told me
Baby, you gotta walk by faith
And not by sight
Real talk, you gotta listen
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, yeah

Oh, listen to me now, I'm gonna say it loud
So you won't be confused 'bout what we talkin' 'bout
I been through the storm, had dirt on my name
I'm still holding on, champion of the game
(They said)

Whatever, don't kill, you make you stronger
Well, I must be the world's strongest woman
See I done, done a whole lotta growin'
Everything you say, I'm already knowin'
Cause I

I been up against ropes
Everything you're going through
I been there before, seen them all come
And I seen them all go

You can bet your last that
My head won't hit the floor, never
And I'm still standing, standing, standing, standing
I'm still standing, standing, standing, standing

I had a lover take his own in front of me
I asked God, why is this happening to me?
But I didn't fold, I held my own
And now I'm deep in love with who I belong
(This is my life)

They say with age comes wisdom
And the white flag, I can't give 'em
Tryin' to tell you how it's s'posed to be
See, this is more than just a song to me
Cause I

I been up against ropes
Everything you're going through
I been there before, seen them all come
And I seen them all go

You can bet your last that
My head won't hit the floor, never
And I'm still standing, standing, standing, standing
I'm still standing, standing, standing, standing

I'm unbreakable, baby
Luda, yeah, it's a family affair
I may have done the things they say I did
But I'm not who they say I am

Try to throw my name in the dirt
But I really don't give a damn
I'm still standing like the Statue of Liberty
And I put my name in the history books
So you'll forever remember me

Remember me as the toughest warrior
Or the ultimate fighter
Cause I'm the truth and nothing but
It's like my hands on the Bible
And it's the survival of the fittest

The realist, it's not a facade
Still standing on my two feet
Cause I'm a child of God
Do something

I been up against ropes
Everything you're going through
I been there before, seen them all come
And I seen them all go

You can bet your last that
My head won't hit the floor, never
And I'm still standing, standing, standing, standing
I'm still standing, standing, standing, standing

I been up against ropes
Everything you're going through
I been there before, seen them all come
And I seen them all go

You can bet your last that
My head won't hit the floor, never
And I'm still standing, standing, standing, standing
I'm still standing, standing, standing, standing

I'm not gonna give up, never
Come too far to look back, oh
Oh, oh, I been there before
I've seen it, I've seen it, I've done it
I've done it, I'm done, let me live my life now

I let it go, I let God, I let it go, and I let God
Don't hate me now
I ain't who I used to be no more

I'm still standing, I'm still standing
I'm still standing, oh, I'm still standing
I'm still standing, you can't take this joy away
