Why did you run I'll always let you leave
You aren't the first to hit and run away from me
As I bounce along the open road
I'm outnumbered and alone

I'm over the moon in ways you won't believe
You say it's too soon for you to know what all this means
If I say that I want all you have
I just want it all back

And though we could have made it last
You've gotta do more than that
You've got to take all you have and pour and pour
You're never gonna see the light
You've got to leave now behind
You're never going to know what's right fro what went wrong
So ignore all the facts
And come running straight back to me to me

It's not a wall you've only me to beat
So you took it all and made it far away from me
Now you're out of sight behind these eyes
And you will stay there all my life
