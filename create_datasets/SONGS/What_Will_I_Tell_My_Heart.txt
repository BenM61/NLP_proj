I'm trying to explain to friends, dear
The reasons we two are apart
I know what to tell our friends, dear
But what can I tell my heart?

It's easy to say to strangers
That we played the game from the start
It's easy to lie to strangers
But what will I tell my heart?

When I smile to hide all the tears inside
What an ache it will be bring
Then I'll wander home to a telephone
That forgot how to ring, ring, ring

I'm telling you'll soon be back, dear
To fool the whole town may be smart
I'll tell them you'll soon be back, dear
But what will I tell my heart?

I could say that you'll soon be back, dear
To fool the whole town may be smart
I'll tell them you'll soon be back, dear
But what will I tell my heart?
