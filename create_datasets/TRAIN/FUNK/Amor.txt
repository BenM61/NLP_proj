Amor, amor, my love
This word so sweet
That I repeat
That I repeat
Means I adore you
Amor, amor, my love,
Would you deny
This heart that I
Have placed before you?

I can't find another word with meaning so clear;
My lips try to whisper sweeter things in your ear
But somehow or other nothing sounds quite so dear
As this soft caressing word I know

Amor, amor, my love,
When you're away,
There is no day
And I know that nights are lonely
Amor, amor, my love
Make life divine,
Say you'll be mine
And a-love me only

Amor, amor, my love,
When you're away,
I know there's no day
And nights are so lonely
Amor, amor, my love
Make life divine,
Say you'll be mine
And love me only

Amor, amor, amor, amor, amor
