If not me then someone else
Who will feel the pain I felt
I may be an old face from a photograph
You may look at me and laugh
Till it's your turn to sing the blues
Knowing what you had to lose
I may be an old fool from her former life
Till you find out what it's like
She'll make you feel like you're the center
Of a place without a trace
Of any man who's gone before

Join us now
The brotherhood of the broken
And we'll be proud to welcome one of ours
Join our chain
Where all the links are broken
I didn't know her that well
I did not know her that well

And if not you then someone else
Who will fall for her and melt
And you'll be an old foe that she left for him
Occasionally mentioned
Till it's his turn and he'll relate
To what it's like to be replaced
You may be an old flame
From her former days.
Till he finds himself erased
He may find her in a corner
And provide for her a shoulder
As she cries her tales of you
He doesn't know he's just a ladder
For her to climb up to the rooftops
Where she'll find a better view

And he'll join us now
The brotherhood of the broken
And we'll be proud to welcome one of ours
Join our chain
Where all the links are broken
He didn't know her that well
You did not know her that well
I did not know her so well
We did not know her that well

You may hold her in the winter
And feel like you're the only man
Who's ever loved her before

So join us now
In the brotherhood of the broken
And we'll be proud to welcome one of ours
Join our chain
Where all the links are broken
You didn't know her that well
We did not know her that well
We did not know her that well
