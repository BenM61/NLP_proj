Well there's no chance for him
The future's looking mighty slim
Born without a Daddy
He can't turn to the family
He cuddles now with danger
While racing to the edge
And his cards they lie face up
Like a drunk upon the ledge

And I wonder, Oh Lord, how I wonder
What a world it would be
Without, without poverty

Like so, like so many before him
They failed, failed to be rescued
Oh, they know not when to surrender
'Cause they got nothing,
they got nothing left to loose
Now a blind man sits behind me
And an idiot begs for change
And I curse the circumstances
But there's no-one left to blame

And I wonder, Oh Lord, I wonder
What a world this would be
Without poverty

What a world this would be
What a world this would be
What a world this would be
What a world this would be
What a world this would be
Without, without poverty
