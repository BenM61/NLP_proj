Time can never mend
The careless whisper of a good friend
To the heart in mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you'll find

I feel so unsure
As you take my hand and lead me to the dance floor
As the music dies
Something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen
And all it's sad goodbye

[Chorus]
I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're your not a fool

Should have known better than to cheat a friend
Waste a chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I dance with you, oh

Time can never mend
The careless whisper of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
But there's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you'll find

[Chorus]

Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
Now who's gonna dance with me
Please stay
