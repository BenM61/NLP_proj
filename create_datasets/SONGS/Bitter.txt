1st So this is love,
So this is pain.
I'm to tired to be brave.
As hard as you fall,
That's how you break
Over and over until its too late
The battle is over.
The blood never dried
The gate was left open,
And so were my eyes.

Bitter!
Yeah, thats me these days
I bite, and I kick, and I hiss and I scratch
Like a lion in a cage.
Bitter!
And the feeling's so strange.
I like him, I love him, I hate him
For making the mess that he made.
I'm giving up what I used to love
'Cause I can't stand the taste.

2nd Heart full of rain, but I'm still on fire.
I'm so sick of desire.
The more that I try, the less I forget
The shape of his body asleep in my bed.
The bells they were rung out.
I said my goodbyes.
And now I'm just run down.
I won't cry 'cause I'm-

Bitter!
Yeah, that's me these days.
I bite, and I kick, and I hiss, and I scratch
Like a lion in a cage.
Bitter!
And the feeling's so strange.
I like him, I love him, I hate him
For making the mess that he made.
I'm giving up what I used to love
'Cause I can't stand the taste.

Where do we go?
Nobody knows, got nothing to show
For wasting my time.
No wonder I'm bitter.
Yeah, that's me these days.
I bite, I kick, I hiss, and I scratch
Like a lion in a cage.
Bitter, and the feeling's so strange.
I like him, I love him, I hate him
For making the mess that he made.

Bitter!
Yeah, that's me these days.
I bite, and I kick, and I hiss, and I scratch
Like a lion in a cage.
Bitter!
And the feeling's so strange.
I like him, I love him, I hate him
For making the mess that he made.
I'm giving up what I used to love
'Cause I can't stand the taste.
