Without him 
choir without him
Without him
choir without him
There'd be no rain to fill the sea
To sail the boat 
That brought me back to you my darling
My loved one my own

Without him 
choir without him
Without him
Choir without him
There'd be no sun to warm me in
To grow the tree
That soon will be a moon above us
For you and for me

And as I gaze at you my love
Standing close to me 
I'd wonder where we'd be my love
Wonder where we'd be
Without him
choir without him
Without him
choir without him

There'd be no heart to beat for you
To tell my lips to speak to you
And say I love you
My darling my own

musical interlude

And as I gaze at you my love
Standing close to me 
I'd wonder where we'd be my love
Wonder where we'd beeeeee
Without him
choir without him
Without him
choir without him

There'd be no heart to beat for you
To tell my lips to speak to you
And say I love you
My darlinggggg
Myyyy ownnnnnnnnnnnn
