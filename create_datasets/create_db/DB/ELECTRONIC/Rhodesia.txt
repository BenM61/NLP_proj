Standing outside on a kitchen floor 
Love utensils in the palm of her hand 
Saluting supermarket majorettes 
We understand 
Oh muzak for digital clocks 
Departmental stores, vacate no sound 
Exchanging surgical appliances 
On hired ground 

And love blows through Rhodesia 
And love blows through Rhodesia 

Soldierettes marching in the parking lot 
Bleach your body 
Be proof to the fact 
Moving out in all directions 
And turning back 

Oh, heartaches from Amsterdam 
Masturbated over jilted bouquets 
Approximation's counting on a freight line 
We pull away 

And love blows through Rhodesia 
And love blows through Rhodesia 

Oh, Nazis in full attack 
Burning niggers in a cotton field 
Service stations offer promises 
And promises offer me 

And love blows through Rhodesia 
And love blows through Rhodesia
