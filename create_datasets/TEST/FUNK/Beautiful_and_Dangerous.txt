Why, oh why, oh why, oh why
Tell me why
Why, oh why, oh why, oh why
Tell me why

Tears are falling down my face
All because of you
River deep and a mountain high
All because of you

Why, oh why, oh why, oh why
I feel like I'm gonna die
Is it because you leave me here
Just to sit and cry

Beautiful and dangerous
There is nothing to discuss, no
You can't capture, no
All you do is freeze

Why, oh why, oh why, oh why
I feel like I'm gonna die
Is it because you leave me here
Just to sit and cry

Why, oh why, oh why, oh why
I feel like I'm gonna die
Is it because you leave me here
Just to sit and cry

Why, oh why, oh why, oh why
Tell me why
Why, oh why, oh why, oh why
Tell me why...
