Little baby trying to sleep
One hundred secrets I couldn't keep
The whole world's waitin' for their dance with satan
The KKK is in town
The Ku Klux Klan is in town

Our village is kinda numb
We're so glad you could come
And if we search we could pray in a church
But all the churches have burned down
The Ku Klux Klan burned them down

And ask me why I won't be there when you say goodbye
If you lie
I won't be there till you say goodbye
And that's why I'm talking to you

Dear Aunt Arctica
Dear Aunt Arctica
Dear Aunt Arctica
What am I gonna do?

Joint compound VCR
Meditate the porno star
Montana's there for me
When I turn on my TV
Aunt Arctica, don't cry no more.
What are you crying for?

Something that I need to add
Her body is just a fad
Her bleached blond hair
And her silky underwear
She's got a boyfriend I'm sure
But how come she can't have one more?

Ask me why I won't be there when you say goodbye
If you lie
I won't be there when you say goodbye, yeah!
And that's why I'm talking to you

Dear Aunt Arctica
Dear Aunt Arctica
Dear Aunt Arctica
What am I gonna do?

Dear Aunt Arctica
Dear Aunt Arctica
Dear Aunt Arctica
What am I gonna...

Dear Aunt Arctica
Dear Aunt Arctica
Dear Aunt Arctica
What am I gonna do?
