Hi there, baby
I just felt that I had to call
'Coz I heard a rumor, just today
It's got to be a lie or this I pray
Feeling, like I, got my back up against the wall

But I just got to say
That the truth is all I'm asking for
Oh oh oh

Hang up, baby get over here
Tell me what's been going on (whats going on)
Please, please, you got to make it clear
Show me what's been going on (whats going on)
So get out of this place
And let's stand face to face
Need your love now I can't bear to lose it all
So hang up baby get over here
Tell me what's been going on

People, talking, it's a thing that we can't control
We've got to be stronger every day
We can't afford to throw this thing away

But I just got to say, yeah, yeah
That the truth is all I'm asking for

Hang up, baby get over here
Tell me what's been going on (whats going on)
Please, please, you got to make it clear
Show me what's been going on (whats going on)
So get out of this place
And lets stand face to face
Need your love now I can't bear to lose it all
So hang up baby get over here
Tell me what's been going on

I can't believe how this thing gotten hold if me
Ooh another minute of the makes it hard to breathe
Can't you understand, baby, what you do to me
Oh oh oh

Hang up, baby, get over here
Tell me what's been going on (what's going on)
Oh oh

Hang up, baby get over here,
Tell me what's been going on (whats going on)
Please, please, you got to make it clear,
Show me what's been going on (whats going on)
So get out of this place
And lets stand face to face
Need your love now I can't bear to lose it all
So hang up baby get over here
Tell me what's been going on...
