Forever I will love you forever

People come and people go
acting happy just for show
Think they do but they don't know
What it is to see love grow
Living life so all alone
Hiding feelings better shown
Nothing better could I own
Than what I have with you

Far and wide I looked for you
Many nights just feeling blue
You told me that you felt it too
Before you came my way
Now I have you by my side
Nothing left for me to hide
Set to face the coming tide
Of what the future brings

Need you baby need you baby
I need you baby right now
