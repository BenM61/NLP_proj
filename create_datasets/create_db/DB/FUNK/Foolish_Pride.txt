When I'm hurt then I come on strong
I want to break down
But I just keep it in
Being too strong is a weakness, girl

'Cause when you fight the world
You know who's gonna win
And you say I won't look you in the eye
It's like talking to a wall

But a wall can crumble down
Yeah there's something that's deep inside
That's gotta be tough
Whenever you're around 

I've got this Foolish Pride
And Pride goes before a fall
Yeah I've got this Foolish Pride 

You make me feel like the livin' end
But the end came quick
And made me want to die
So I played like I didn't care
Didn't mess my hair
Believe me I don't know why 

I've got this Foolish Pride
And Pride goes before a fall
Yeah I've got this Foolish Pride 

If I wanted I colled have fooled 'em all
That's great 'til tomorrow when I'm all alone
You know the truth comes out in the end
When the fools start falling they need their friends
