Like a flower in a hurricane
A finger painting left out in the pouring rain
Sweet words whispered on a subway train
Wasted and lost in the noise
Beautiful
Breakable
Like a butterfly in an angry world
so breakable
She lies wide awake hearing their screams
When the front door slams she don't know what it means
Though she shuts her eyes the tears still stream
Wasted and lost in all the noise
Beautiful
Breakable
Like a butterfly in an angry world
so breakable
Beautiful innocence in an angry world so breakable
The heart is fragile handle with care
Hold it it's precious
There's treasure inside
Beautiful
Breakable
Like a butterfly in an angry world
so breakable
Beautiful innocence in an angry world so breakable
