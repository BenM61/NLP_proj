These Hollow resolutions can only perpetuate your fatals situation 
Agonizing self-inflictions permeating throughout 
The guns are assigned, let the games begin 
Programmed oaths of loyalty without inherent servitude 
Where he dignified and selfhood reign supreme 
The animus makes us what we are 
The treasons shows who we are 
Nemesis made us more beautiful than others 
To conceal its own weakness 
The architect is abortive 
As are his children 
Infinite in its potential and fragile in its design 
The guns are assigned, let the games begin
