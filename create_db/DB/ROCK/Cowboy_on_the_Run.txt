Sometimes I dream of a world without war
People laughing in the sun
And a world without love ain't no place to live
Yet, we're still living but the gun
And I'm just another cowboy on the run

Sometimes the rain gets all in my eyes
'Till I can't see the wrongs I've done
I've got trouble on ahead, the sheriff's close behind
Oh God, I'd love to see the sun
And I'm just another cowboy on the run

Standing in a window, I don't know what to do
Standing in a doorway, I'm trying to pass on through
Walking on a freeway, I don't know where to go
Out on my highway, there's nothing here to do

I'd like to sail the sea, ride wild and free
And act as if my time won't ever come
Well, I keep on getting higher, set my soul on fire
But when it's all been said and done
I'm just one more cowboy on the run

Just another cowboy on the run
Oh, how I'd love to see the sun
And we're still living by the gun
