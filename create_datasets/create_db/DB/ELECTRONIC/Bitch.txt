Oh, oh my bitch
You're gonna be my bitch
Oh, my bitch

Up to this night

I was waiting for you and you know that I don't like what you do
Do, do I feel like statue, stuck, nude
Rock but you whip me and I don't like it when I'm on the ground up to this night
You treat me like your pet, your fool
I'm gonna change the rules bitch oh my bitch up to this night

I was waiting for you and you know that I don't like what you do
I feel like statue, stuck, nude
Rock but you whip me and I don't like it when I'm on the ground up to this night
You treat me like your fool
Your pet I'm gonna change the rules
You're gonna be my bitch

Oh, oh my bitch
You're gonna be my bitch
Oh, my bitch
You're gonna be
You 're on the end of my lead
You're gonna be my bitch
Bitch, 'cause you're gonna be my bitch

Up to this night
I was waiting for you and you know that I don't like what you do
I feel like statue, stuck, nude
Rock but you whip me and I don't like it when I'm on the ground up to this night
You treat me like your fool
Your pet I'm gonna change the rule but from tonight, everything is gonna be alright
You 're on the end of my lead and now
You're gonna be my bitch
'Cause you're gonna be my bitch
