Just girl to boy
I'd like to share this thought with you
Our love's a joy
Two one's have made inseparable two
Last night my heart spoke to me
And it said
You've found that lover-friend
So now I've finally got the courage
Just ask You Baby ooh

Will you, will you
Will you marry me boy
Will you, will you
Will you marry me
Will you, will you
Will you marry me boy
Will you, will
Will you, will you, will you
Come on baby now

I lay awake
So full with hope of things to come
For heaven's sake
I pray I'm not the only one
I never dreamed I'd be so bold
I'm standing here, my heart's been sold
So now I've finally got the courage
Just ask you baby ooh

Will you, will you
Will you marry me boy
Will you, will you
Will you marry me
Will you, will you
Will you marry me boy
Will you, will
Will you, will you, will you
Come on baby now

Think of love as wings
Not a ball and chain
And Your fear of things
Unnecessary
I only want to share your name
Share your name
Last night my heart spoke to me
And it said
You've found that lover-friend
So now I've finally got the courage
Just ask You Baby ooh

Will you, will you
Will you marry me boy
Will you, will you
Will you marry me
Will you, will you
Will you marry me boy
Will you, will
Will you, will you, will you
Come on baby now

Maybe Sunday
Come on Monday
Baby any time this week
Get an old house
Find a back Yard
Buy some flowers down street
Tell your mother
Tell your father
Don't tell anyone at all
All we need is
Just the two of us
And oh
