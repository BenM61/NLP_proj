Get your steel brothers
We must fight
Hakon tries to steal
Scotish right
Norwegian soldiers on our land
Steal our Islands
We must defend
Their number's too great we can't win
God in heaven
Send a sign

Kneel and pray - the sun turns black
God with us - we must attack

[Chorus:]
In the dark of the sun
[4 times]

Alex king you did
win the day
You bet Hakon and
Proud Norway
We swept them off the battlefield
In their blood they lie
Death is dealed
Their king died on foreign land
United we were strong
we did stand

[Chorus:]
In the dark of the sun
The enemy's defeated run
In the dark of the sun
The battle has been won
