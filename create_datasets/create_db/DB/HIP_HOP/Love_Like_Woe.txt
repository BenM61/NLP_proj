(J-J-J-J-JR)
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
(I kinda feel like it don't make sense)

I'm thinking, baby, you and I are undeniable
But I'm finding our loves unreliable
I'm giving all I got to make you stay
Or am I just a roadblock in your way?

'Cause you're a pretty little windstorm out on the boulevard
Something like a Sunset, oh you're a shooting star
And I might drive myself insane
If those lips aren't speaking my name

'Cause I got some intuition,
Or maybe I'm superstitious
But I think you're a pretty sweet pill that I'm swallowing down
To counter this addiction, you've got me on a mission
Tell me darling, can I get a break somehow?
(How) could I say no?

She's got a love like woe
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh,
Girls got a love like woe (la-da-da)
I kinda feel like it don't make sense
Because you're bringing me in and now you're kicking me out again
Love so strong, then you moved on
Now I'm hung up in suspense,
Because you're bringing me in and then you're kicking me out again

It's like a hurricane, speed train, she's a moving car
Catch her in the fast lane, oh I gotta know,
Can I keep up with her pace?
Kick it into gear when I see that face

You can take up all my time cause you're the only one
That can make a storm cloud break, pulling out the sun
And I can't get caught in the rain
Can I get your lips to speak my name?

'Cause I got some intuition,
Or maybe I'm superstitious
But I think you're a pretty sweet pill that I'm swallowing down
To counter this addiction, you've got me on a mission
Tell me darling, can I get a break somehow?
(How) could I say no?

She's got a love like woe
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh,
Girls got a love like woe (la-da-da)
I kinda feel like it don't make sense
Because you're bringing me in and now you're kicking me out again
Love so strong, then you moved on
Now I'm hung up in suspense,
Because you're bringing me in and then you're kicking me out again

'Cause we only have one life
The timing and the moment,
All seem so right
So would you say you're mine? (We'll be just fine)
Would you say you're mine? (We'll be just fine)

She's got a love like woe
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh,
Girls got a love like woe (la-da-da)
I kinda feel like it don't make sense
Because you're bringing me in and now you're kicking me out again
Love so strong, then you moved on
Now I'm hung up in suspense,
Because you're bringing me in and then you're kicking me out again

She's got a love like woe
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh,
Girls got a love like woe (la-da-da)
I kinda feel like it don't make sense
Because you're bringing me in and now you're kicking me out again
Love so strong, then you moved on
Now I'm hung up in suspense,
Because you're bringing me in and then you're kicking me out again
