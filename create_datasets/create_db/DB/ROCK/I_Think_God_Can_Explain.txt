There's a lot of things I understand  
And there's a lot of things that
I don't want to know  
But you're the only face I recognize  
It's so damn sweet of you 
to look me in the eyes  

It's alright, I'm O.K. 
I think God can explain  
I believe I'm the same 
I get caried away  

It's alright, I'm O.K. 
I think God can explain  
I'm relieved I'm relaxed 
I'll get over it yet  

The scent of vasoline 
in the summertime  
The feel of an icecube 
Melting overtime  
The world seems bigger 
Than both of us  
Yet it seems so small 
when I begin to cry

It's alright I'm O.K.
I think God can explain
I believe I'm the same 
I get carried away

It's alright I'm O.K.
I think God can explain
I'm relieved I'm relaxed
I'll get over it yet.

I'm so much better than you guessed
I'm so much bigger than you guessed
I'm so much brighter than you guessed

It's alright I'm O.K. 
I think God can explain
I believe I'm the same
I get carried away

It's alright I'm O.K.
I think God can explain
I'm relieved I'm relaxed
I'll get off of your back

I think God can explain
I think God can explain
I think God can explain
