Working on the weekend baby
She's working all through the night.
A jump into the deep end,
Gave her the evidence she required.
Take five, she's got pearls,
Don't fake it when it comes to making money -
So... she smiles, but that's cruel
If you knew what she'd think, if you knew what she was after...
Sometimes she wonders... and she laughs in her frustration

Would someone please explain...
The reason for this strange behaviour
In exploitation's name...
We must be working for the skin trade.

Doctors of the revolution gave us, the medicine we desired.
Besides being absolutely painless it's a question of compromise
You've got steel, it's so cool,
Get angry at the weekend then go back to school
So big deal, it's what rules
When it comes to making money, say yes, please, thank you...
Sometimes you wonder, and you ask yourself the question

Would someone please explain...
The reason for this strange behaviour
In exploitation's name...
We must be working for the skin trade.
Would someone please explain...
The reason for this strange behaviour
In exploitation's name...
We must be working for the skin trade.

I know the answer... but I'm asking you the question...

Would someone please explain...
The reason for this strange behaviour
In exploitation's name...
We must be working for the skin trade.
Would someone please explain...
The reason for this strange behaviour
In exploitation's name...
We must be working for the skin trade.
Would someone please explain...
The reason for this strange behaviour
In exploitation's name...
We must be working for the skin trade.
