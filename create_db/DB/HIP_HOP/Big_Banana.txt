DJ Havana Brown, you crazy?
Havana I heard you had a question though

Let's go, thicker than a Magnum, ace of spades
Strobe light, we can play charades
My pants keep grenades
Bananas, clips, shoot for days let's go (Gi-gi-gi-give me)
Let's go (Gi-gi-gi-give me)
Let's go (Gi-gi-gi-give me)
What? That big fat

I'm goin' out tonight
Got it locked down, I don't want to fight
I'm a hot girl, I have a right
Have a right, have a right
Kill or die hard I'm a call you bruised
Feel dropped out and I'm a call you Cruise
Beat it up up up, pop the juice
Pop the juice, pop the juice

Big ba-na-nana ooh na-na-nana
Big ba-na-nana ooh na-na-nana
Big ba-na-nana ooh na-na-nana
Big ba-na-nana ooh na-na-nana

If you want that, baby I got it

Gi-gi-gi-give me
Gi-gi-gi-give me
Gi-gi-gi-give me
That big fat

Freaky shit don't matter black or white
Let me shake the uh don't cut the light
Let 'em all bark, I love to bite
Love to bite, love to bite
Getting tipsy, ain't getting loose
I got the vibe, they got the juice
Beat it up up up, pop the juice
Pop the juice, pop the juice

Big ba-na-nana ooh na-na-nana
Big ba-na-nana ooh na-na-nana
Big ba-na-nana ooh na-na-nana
Big ba-na-nana ooh na-na-nana

Big ba-na-nana ooh na-na-nana
Big ba-na-nana ooh na-na-nana
Big ba-na-nana ooh na-na-nana
Big ba-na-nana ooh na-na-nana

Do you have a big banana?

(Gi-gi-gi-give me) 
Let's go (Gi-gi-gi-give me) 
Let's go (Gi-gi-gi-give me)

Let's go (Gi-gi-gi-give me) 
Let's go (Gi-gi-gi-give me) 
Let's go, that big fat let's go go

She don't know
Underneath the belt and the Polo
Thicker than a trunk on a Volvo
Audemar black with the rose gold

Let's go go, she don't know
Underneath the belt and the Polo
Thicker than a trunk on a Volvo
