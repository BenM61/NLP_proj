'Say' f*ck you man. 
I don't need what you got I'll go my own way.
I give you all I got to give but man you just can't take it.
You spend up all your nights and days just building walls around you.
It makes it so damn hard for me to say hello to you today.

So listen up as I speak words to you that say tomorrow.
You make it so damn hard for me to say hello to you today.
