Ride the subway home
Pretend that you're not home
When somebody calls you
But nobody calls you

And it's me who loves you still
And I always will

But there are tears all over town
Too many tears all over this town
There are tears all over town
Too many tears

Once there were trumpets in the air
And confetti in your hair
And I knew where I belonged
Now I'm singing you this song

And every star we held that night
We reached for it all you know we tried

But there are tears all over town
Too many tears all over this town
There are tears all over town
Too many tears

I'm scattered like newspapers all over the street
I see your face in everyone I meet
I'm avoiding the corners
I'm avoiding your name
I know that I loved you but I loved you in vain

And this city's too small for two
My melancholy friend and you

And these tears all over town
Too many tears all over this town
Tears all over town
Too many tears all over this town
Too many tears
Too many tears...
