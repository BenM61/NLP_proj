Sometimes I see your face looking at me
All your love and grace smiling at me
All the things we had and never understood
At times it cuts me up thinking of you
All the hope I've got wasted on you
All the talks we had never did no good

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

Pour another glass
While I watch the bottle disappear
While I watch the morning light appear
Thinking about you

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

I met this girl last night and she said
"Why won't you marry me?"
He met this girl last night and she said
"Why won't you marry me?"

But I'm too young for that
Too dumb for that
Too broke for that
Too tired for that
Too proud for that
And I'm too gone for that
Would you like to come back to my flat?

Oh maybe I don't need you to save me
I just want you to help me
'Cause you're keeping me up all night
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night

Oh maybe (oh maybe) I don't need you to save me (I don't need you to save me)
I just want you to help me (I just want you to help me)
'Cause you're keeping me up all night (Why don't you do that for me?)
I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting here for nothing
I should be up all night with you

Come on just say you'll stay
