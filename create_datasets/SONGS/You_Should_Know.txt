You can't have my love no more

You should know it's over now
'Cause I got another love
So I'm saying...
You should know it's over now
'Cause I got another love

You never gave me all your special time
'Cause you're too busy hanging out
That's not what my love's about
I gave my heart, my soul, my trust to you
You tried to play me for a fool
That's why I found somebody new

You should know it's over now
'Cause I got another love
So I'm saying...
You should know it's over now
'Cause I got another love

You don't have to play these games no more
'Cause there's someone new in my life
And they always treat me right
I don't even know why you still try
'Cause there's no way I'm coming back
Girl it's way too late for that

You should know it's over now
'Cause I got another love
So I'm saying...
You should know it's over now
'Cause I got another love

I need someone who's there for me
You just don't have that quality
I tried to give you everything
But you couldn't love me
So I'm saying...

You should know it's over now
'Cause I got another love
So I'm saying...
You should know it's over now
'Cause I got another love
