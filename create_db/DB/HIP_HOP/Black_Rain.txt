Black rain...theres no chance 2 exscape it 
You know how it seem like sometimes nothin but bad luck 
It just won't go right that's the black rain 

[Chorus 2X]
black rain black rain 
don't come 
you've been wettin us up from day one 
we ain't never seen a high point howcome 
black rain black rain comes under the sun 

[E.D.I.]
We live those big money dreams 
sixteen and so plining 
lust to touch everything still no feelings 
we move on 
through these storms 
when its on its on we move strong 
you know the rules 
roll with fools who use two's no trianing 
hit ya block no stop no aiming 
black raining 
and man the forecast leak 
stay inside ??? gone for weeks 
its war on the streets 
gang bangin ??? 
not a city that never sleeps and never see beefs 
bad enough we still killing eachther over ??? 
now its more bust ??? to over color 
man its insane black rain 
feeding our seeds making em strong for payin the game 
and yo we won't change 
you better recognize 
and its a damn shame 'cause its right in our eyes 

[Chorus 2X]
black rain black rain 
don't come 
you've been wettin us up from day one 
we ain't never seen a high point howcome 
black rain black rain comes under the sun 

[Napolean]
I seen it all 
when the black rain falls 
ride where you fall 
black bodies fall 
black rain... you got time to explain 
while I'm still strugglin damn near insane 
damn near in pain...from years ago 
only you know how the story goes 
took mah got lead all in me 
1st you came now the Lord's calling me 
all in me is what my outlawz train me 
and all in me is what my brothers gave me 
and all you see is just another young thug 
but plese let my baby boy play in the mud 
play in the sun 
please let him have some fun 
don't wet the sidewalk walk that he walk to school from 
and don't let the pain that i touch he feel 
and don't let him trust no snakes that's real 

[Chorus 2X]
black rain black rain 
don't come 
you've been wettin us up from day one 
we ain't never seen a high point howcome 
black rain black rain comes under the sun 

[Kastro]
Its cold outside in the middle of the summer 
days fly by nights fall like lumber 
crys... inside of the minds of the younger...the hunger 
scream through the city like thunder 
its like a bunch of black clouds we under 
from day one to day none my heart getting nummer 
its dark...tommorw might come alone 
scince i can't see clear i stumble the home 
it ain't fair 
the air out here to thin 
i breath...and don't beliveve in the hearts of men...its triflin 
the life we in needs change till then we hustle in this black rain 

[Young Noble]
Yo...aint no way out the hood 
can't stay out the hood 
hustle hard to everyday out is good 
the days seem dark but the nights is bright 
ain't nobody going down so we like to fight 
cops they come around tryin to cuff me up 
lock a brotha down tryin to ruff me up 
we got a snitch on the block yeah they tellin authorities 
watchin like hawks but I'm sellin regaurdless 
my baby due soon i ain't playin wit y'all 
it happend so fast 1st day already gone 
a million new fiends on coke this year 
a million whole familys went broke this year 
we tryin to live long can you tell me how 
I'm hopin that my heat don't fail me now 
everytime i take a step they try and tair me down 
but see me in the flesh and you starrin me down 
i do it for my fam 'cause I'm livin for em 
we seein a clouds but i paint a perfect picture for em 
black rain 
black rain...we see clouds but i paint a perfect picture for em 

[Chorus 2X]
black rain black rain 
don't come 
you've been wettin us up from day one 
we ain't never seen a high point howcome 
black rain black rain comes under the sun
