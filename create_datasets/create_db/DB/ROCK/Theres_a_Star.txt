Tonight there's no denying
No there's no denying
There's something magic in the air
Emotional disorder
Came from out of nowhere
And took me unaware
The patterns of the oceans
Lost in her emotions
You know that I don't care

And on nights when the north wind
Blows through your heart
Dream of a new age
And on nights when the north wind
Blows through your heart
All I can do is wait

There's a star in the night sky
The kind of star we will be hoping for
There's a star in the night sky
The kind of star we will be dreaming for

Cool evening is falling
I can hear her calling
Cross the serpentine
Dark and chaotic
Slow and hypnotic
She comes into my mind
And tonight nothing matters
No it doesn't matter
Everything will be fine

And on nights when the north wind
Blows through your heart
Dream of a new age
And on nights when the north wind
Blows through your heart
All I can do is wait

There's a star in the night sky
The kind of star we will be hoping for
There's a star in the night sky
The kind of star we will be dreaming for
There's a star in the night sky
The kind of star we will be wishing for

There's a star in the night sky
The kind of star we will be hoping for
There's a star in the night sky
The kind of star we will be dreaming for
There's a star in the night sky
The kind of star we will be wishing for
There's a star in the night sky
