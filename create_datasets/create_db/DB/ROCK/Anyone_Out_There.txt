I never found out what made you leave
And now the day is over, just an hour to go
I tried to phone last night but you never answered
Just left me ringing on the line

Outside is there anyone out there, anyone else outside
Oh, outside love is there anyone out there, anyone else outside

My face in the mirror shows the break in time
A crack in the ocean which does not align
I tried to sleep last night but I've caught your dreaming
About days we used to wonder away

Outside is there anyone out there, anyone else outside
Oh outside love is there anyone out there, anyone else outside

Look out of the window maybe you can call by my name
Another night over babe another light comes on in vain

I tried to phone last night but you never answered
Just left me ringing in the air (outside)

Is there anyone out there
(Anyone out there, oh)
(Anyone out there, anyone out there, oh)
(Anyone out there, anyone out there, oh)
(Anyone out there, anyone out there, oh)
(Anyone out there, anyone out there)
