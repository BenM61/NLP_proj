Farewell my summer love, farewell.
Girl I won't forget you.
Farewell my summer love, farewell, ooh.
 
I found my happiest days when you came to see your grandma in May.
I bumped into you at the corner store;
I told you that you sure looked good, now.
 
Farewell my summer love, farewell.
Girl I won't forget you.
Farewell my summer love, farewell, ooh.
 
Your grandma's house was next to mine,
we were together most of the time.
But summer's gotten away from us;
time's moving too fast for us.
 
Bye, bye, don't turn around, 'cause you might see me cry.
Farewell my summer love, farewell.
Girl I won't forget you.
Farewell my summer love, farewell, ooh.
 
When you return to your hometown,
And discuss your trip,
Will I be the guy that you put down,
Or someone that you won't forget, no?
 
Farewell my summer love, farewell.
Girl I won't forget you.
Farewell my summer love, farewell, ooh.
 
I'll never forget you,
And maybe next year
When you're out of school
You'll return, but until you do, baby;
 
Farewell my summer love, farewell.
Girl I won't forget you.
Farewell my summer love, farewell, ooh.
Ooh, farewell, farewell.
Ooh, farewell, farewell.
 
If you remember my name, drop a line sometime.
Farewell my summer love, farewell.
Girl I won't forget you.
Farewell my summer love, farewell, ooh.
