Get my head out of the clouds
Smoke and mirrors all around
Kick this beat out of the room
Till you hear my heart go boom

Find me in a crowd of silhouettes
(i don't care if the people stare)
Dancing to a beat that's in my head
(it goes something like this)

I wear my headphones at the disco
And nobody ever has to know
I wear my headphones at the disco
And when the music stops
Then you'll hear me singing

La la lalala, la la la la lalala (x4)

Out of step and out of time
Close my eyes, I'm feeling fine
Colours flashing on my face
I could be in outta space

Find me in a crowd of silhouettes
(i don't care if the people stare)
Dancing to a beat that's in my head
(it goes something like this)

I wear my headphones at the disco
And nobody ever has to know
I wear my headphones at the disco
And when the music stops
Then you'll hear me singing

La la lalala, la la la la lalala (x4)

... headphones at the disco... (x7)

And when the music stops
Then you'll hear me singing

La la lalala, la la la la lalala (x4)

I wear my headphones at the disco

I wear my headphones at the disco
And nobody ever has to know
I wear my headphones at the disco
And when the music stops
Then you'll hear me singing

La la lalala, la la la la lalala (x4)

I wear my headphones at the disco
