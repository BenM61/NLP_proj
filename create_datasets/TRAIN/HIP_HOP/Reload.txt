We're gonna make the stars come out tonight
So why don't you reload reload re reload the music
Reload reload re reload the music
Just throw those hands up, show them you don't care
I want you to reload reload re reload the music
Reload reload re reload the music

Reload reload
Reload reload re reload the music

We just came to live some life
We roll out when we want
I be right inside the party
Jamming to my favorite songs
All the stars are on the ground right now
But that won't be for long
We go back up into the sky and shine
Put my high beam on
I'm liking the vibe she's on
Looking into my eyes
I might want to talk and take a walk
But I'm avoiding spies

They see me vibing with the blames
And ladies by my side
I see them with a smile like hi
Willing to chat my name on the sly
That's when I raise a glass up high
I want this moment for life
So DJ reload it says the host who's there on the mic
This game can be a good thing
Only if your future's bright
That plane can be a good thing
That's why I'm always on flights

Tonight's a moment, yeah it's going down
So why don't you reload reload re reload the music
Reload reload re reload the music
Shit might get crazy, hope that you ain't scared
I want you to reload reload re reload the music
Reload reload re reload the music

Yo, see I've been working all week
Man I could use a drink
Long as I'm with all my people
I don't care what club we hit
Wake up drunk like Ed Sheeran
Last night was perfect
I'm surprised I ain't dead
I took more shots than Curtis
All my freshers
That know I'm the freshest
It's first year you want a first
Tonight I'll pray you'll get it
You see I started rapping at fourteen
Met Wiley at one six
Household name in the game now
And I ain't ever touched one brick
So DJ's press play
Bottles up
It's toast time
The Roley's presidential like it's vote time
We taking shots
No free throw
This is down for that reload
Like oxide neutrino

We're gonna make the stars come out tonight
So why don't you reload reload re reload the music
Reload reload re reload the music

Just throw those hands up, show them you don't care
I want you to reload reload re reload the music
Reload reload re reload the music

We're gonna make the stars come out tonight
So why don't you reload reload re reload the music
Reload reload re reload the music
