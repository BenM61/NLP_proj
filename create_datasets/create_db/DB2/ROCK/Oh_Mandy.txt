I got a gnome in the backyard
I put him right on the X mark
He's supposed to show me where the money is
Hey, won't you show me where the money is?

I got it all on the back of my hand
I want your answer so I won't forget
Then show me right where your heart is
Oh, right now tell me where your heart is

Oh Mandy, oh Mandy
Oh Mandy, oh Mandy
So dreamy, oh Mandy
So killing, oh Mandy

Sure I had trouble from the onset
I tried to chase things I couldn't get
Show me a rerun on the W
Show me a rerun on the WB

So what's it like to be in it
And move away to the Midwest
I gotta message for your auntie
I gotta message for your auntie

Oh Mandy, oh Mandy
Oh Mandy, oh Mandy
So dreamy, oh Mandy
So killing, oh Mandy

Oh Mandy, oh Mandy
Can read me and has me
Oh Mandy, oh Mandy?s
Completely out of reach

And now I know I'm at the end of my wits
Don't gotta tell me where this is going
'Cause I know nothing ever falls apart
Yeah, I know nothing ever falls apart

Remind me once more where this is going
Before I fling it out into the ocean

It?s kind of level but it's wavy
It's looking more blue than it is green
It?s looking quiet as I jump in
So I can finally hear you scream

You got a gnome in the backyard
You put him right on the X mark
You're eating brains out the back of my head
Oh yeah, that's where the money is

Oh Mandy, oh Mandy
Oh Mandy, oh Mandy
So dreamy, oh Mandy
So killing, oh Mandy

Oh Mandy, oh Mandy
Can read me and has me
Oh Mandy, oh Mandy?s
Completely out of reach
