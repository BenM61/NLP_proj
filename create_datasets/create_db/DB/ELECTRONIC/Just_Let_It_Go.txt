So l tell you that it's over 
Now you're standing on your own 
Left to face the world alone 
Never thought that I would leave you 
Ya didn't mean that much to me 
l was just a fantasy 
I never cheated never lied. 
Never could get through to you no matter how l tried 
didn't t hurt you or make you cry 
I guess you know the reason why I said goodbye 

Just let it go - reach for the sky 
Just let it go - take my body high 
Just let it go - straight to the top 
Just let it go - don't you ever stop 

Once again the phone is ringing 
l try to make it clear to you 
can't you realize we?re through 
But you never get the message 
Hanging up is all l can do 
I don't want to torture you 
It isn't easy, what I've done 
Can't you just accept that I am happy now you're gone 
I know you're sorry but it's true 
Get up off the floor boy what ya gonna do? 

Ricky Rick?s gonna drop da dope logistics and everybody here can just get with it 
Dance like you never danced before my rhyme styles fat and I'm burning dance floors 
Up da way l rocked da Jamms back to attack with another grandslam 
So get with it get g-get with it Da Force is back and the sky da limit 
Move like ya really don't care holler if ya hear da sound and your mind stays in there 
And I'm a go to work on this track break it down and bring da beats back for da ninety five 
We're an point so keep da vibes alive and doing what ya know so set ya mind free and let ya body go
