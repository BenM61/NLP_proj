We got telepathy
Psychic TV
In our eyes 
We got a cobra kiss
We're cosmic kids
In disguise

High love my inferno
High love my inferno
High love my inferno
High high love

'Cause the prettiest thing in the whole wide world
Is a girl and a boy keep dancing
Hear a butterfly sing
Feel reality swirl
For a boy and a girl 
In love

I don't worry about a thing
He's my spirit king
I'm his voodoo queen

We speak in tongues
Dance like Egyptians
Know what I mean

'Cause the prettiest thing in the whole wide world
Is a girl and a boy keep dancing
Hear a butterfly sing
Feel reality swirl
For a boy and a girl 
In love

Fever, fever, fever
Fever, fever, fever

'Cause the prettiest thing in the whole wide world
Is a girl and a boy keep dancing
Hear a butterfly sing
Feel reality swirl
For a boy and a girl 
In love

On a beautiful cloud 
Floating over the sky
Is a girl and a boy
Keep dancing
Feel your heart cry aloud
For the ultimate high
Of a boy and a girl
In love

High love my inferno
High love my inferno
High love my inferno
High high love
