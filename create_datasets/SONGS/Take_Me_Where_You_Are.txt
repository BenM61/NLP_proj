Take me where you are
I wish upon a star
Take me where you are
I wish upon a dream
To me tell what to see

Is it upon the waters
To see my life before me
To chase this grand illusion
Of what I really thought I outta be

To add to my confusion
You send a test here for me
I close my eyes and
Wait for the answer that
I know I'll receive

Your voice is like the wind
It journeys to my soul
It stirs and moves within
You are everything
You are everything

I wish upon a star
Take me where you are
I wish upon a dream
To me tell what to see
