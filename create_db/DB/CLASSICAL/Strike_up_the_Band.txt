Let the drums roll out
Let the trumpet call 
While the people shout 
"Strike up the band"

Hear the cymbals ring 
Callin' one and all 
To the martial swing
Strike up the band

There is work to be done, to be done 
Let's have fun, fun, fun
Come on you son of a son, of a gun 
Take your stand

Fall in line, yea a bow
Come along, let's go 
Hey, Leader, strike up the band!

There is work to be done, to be done

Fall in line, yea a bow
Come on, let's go 
Hey, Leader, strike up 
Hey, Leader, strike up 
Hey, Leader, strike up the band!
