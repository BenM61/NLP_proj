Whenever I think of you it seems so unfair
That I have to close my eyes to see you there
I know I'm making it now, but it's tough
I can't begin to tell you enough
The pain is too much

And I give my heart in a prayer
And send it with love
You, just say the word I'll be there
Send it with love
Send it with love

I've come to realize that I'm on my own
So whenever I'm scared inside
I dream that you're home
It's hard to say
How everything happened so fast
So many questions to ask

Oh, I give my heart in a prayer
And send it with love
You, just say the word I'll be there
Send it with love
Send it with love

Is it right or is it wrong
To want you here so much?
But I can never bring you back
So I feel what I can't touch

I've come to realize that I'm on my own
And I give my heart in a prayer
And send it with love
You, just say the word I'll be there
Send it with love
Send it with love
