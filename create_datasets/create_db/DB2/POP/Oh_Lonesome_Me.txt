Everybody's going out and having fun 
I'm just a fool for staying home and having none 
I can't get over how she set me free 
Oh lonesome me 

A bad mistake I'm making bout just hanging round 
I know that I should have some fun an paint the town 
A love sick fool that's blind and just can't see 
Oh lonesome me 

I'll bet she's not like me 
She's out an fancy free 
Flirting with the boys with all her charms 
But I still love her so 
And brother don't you know 
I'd welcome her right back here in my arms 

Well there must be some way 
I can lose these lonesome blue 
Forget about the past and find somebody new 
I've thought of everything from A to Z 
Oh lonesome me

(ba-de-op-bop-bop) 
(Oh lonesome me) 

Well I bet she's not like me 
She's out and fancy free 
Flirting with the boys with all her charms 
But I still love her so 
And brother don't you know 
I'd welcome her right back into my arms 

Well there must be some way 
I can lose these lonesome blues 
Forget about the past and find somebody new 
I've thought of everything from A to Z 
Oh lonesome me 
Oh lonesome me
