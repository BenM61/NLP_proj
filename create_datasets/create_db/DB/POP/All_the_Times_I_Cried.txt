You don't come around no more
Like you used to do
Oh God, I miss your company
Your innocence you know just like
Yeah, like it used to be
And how I need you here with me

You just kept on askin' why
And never wantin' to really try

'Cause all the times I've cried
All this pain I've tried to hide
What am I supposed to dream
When nothin's ever what it seems'

The pain, it drifts from day to day
And it makes me think
That how I wish it would subside
To smile again all the fears be gone
Find my self respect
There's nothin' done with that effect

You just kept on askin' why
And never wantin' to really try

'Cause all the times I've cried
All this pain I've tried to hide
What am I supposed to dream
When nothin's ever what it seems'

Oh, you never were the one
Oh, you never were the one

All the times I've cried
All this pain I've tried to hide
What am I supposed to dream
When nothin's ever what it seems'

All the times I've cried
All this pain I've tried to hide
What am I supposed to dream
When nothin's ever what it seems'
