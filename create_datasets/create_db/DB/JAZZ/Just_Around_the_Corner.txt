Things aren't quite as they seem inside my domain

You can't know about everything
Only pleasure and pain.
You wonder why I come here with head to my hands

Where else can I be cured and the king of your mansion?
A thorn in your side
A child to protect that claims he's free.

Just around the corner
Half a mile to heaven

Strong enough to hold you
Starved for some affection.
Darling
Come quickly
Come ease my mind

For my prayers have not been answered in a long time.

I've already made my bed
Like it or not

As long as there's no regrets I'll be here
When the ride stops.
These comforts to me and these crosses to bare
With which we live.

Just around the corner
Half a mile to heaven

Strong enough to hold you
Starved for some affection.
Baby
I can't drag you into this mess!

I'm the thorn in your side and the child to protect.
Just around the corner
Half a mile to heaven
