The bio-sphere, the place we live
It seems like we don't give a damn
Other species flushed down the tubes
We need another race to rape
The way we live we will destroy
Every other living thing 
'Til none are left except our race
And then we will destroy ourselves

Another oil spill
Atomic waste displaced
Another forest dies
Bring on the acid rain

Slightly insane, the type of greed
That makes a world unfir for life
Toxic wastes destroy the seas
While poison gas pollutes the air
A waste of life, while no one cares
The earth becomes a giant tomb
Critical mass will be achieved
And ruins will be all that's left

Another oil spill
Atomic waste displaced
Another forest dies

A Hell on Earth, what we create
Dragging life to death with us
All living things destroyed or used
By shortsighted human beeings
We do these things, let them be done
Apathy creates despair
The damage done will be too great
The world wounded beyond repair

Another oil spill
Atomic waste displaced
Another forest dies
