Hey darling, you know
The lights are getting low
Hey, hey, hey, hey, darling
Well, you know the lights are getting low

And you know I hate to say it, baby
But I believe it's time to go, yeah

Let me love you, baby
Now while we have the time
Hum, let me take our love, baby
Well, now while we have the time

Well, if you don't do it, baby
You know that old clock's gonna chime
Hum, hum, yeah

Well, my momma told me
'Bout girls like you
Oh, well my momma told me
Hum 'bout girls of your kind, yeah

But honey, believe me I know
Hum good love's so hard to find

Hey, hey, hey, hey, darling
You know the lights are getting low, oh, oh
Hey, hey, darling yeah, well you know the lights
Are getting low, oh, oh, yeah

And you know I'd like to stay here
But I believe it's time to go
