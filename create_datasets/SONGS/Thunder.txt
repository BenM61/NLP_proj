First, it was heaven
Everything roses and fire
You and I were golden

Now it's Armageddon
And I woke up like a fighter
Putting up a legion

You were rising like a star
Reigning like a king
While I was waiting in the wings

And I won't wait any longer
When you left me down, I got stronger
If you want to fight the lightning
I'm on the horizon
Well, I'm coming back with the thunder
(With the thunder, with the thunder)
Well, I'm coming back with the thunder
(With the thunder, with the thunder)
Well, I'm coming back with the thunder

Scared that you're a missile
Scared that I would shine without you
So you held me down, down

But this voice was getting loud
And it just wouldn't give in
'Cause I was made to sing

And I won't wait any longer
When you left me down, I got stronger
If you want to fight the lightning
I'm on the horizon
Well, I'm coming back with the thunder
(With the thunder, with the thunder)
Well, I'm coming back with the thunder

With an empty heart, I am free again
Some things have to start, some have to end
With an empty heart, I am free again
Some things have to start, some have to end

And I won't wait any longer
When you left me down, I got stronger
If you want to fight the lightning
I'm on the horizon
Well, I'm coming back with the thunder (with the thunder)
(With the thunder, with the thunder)
Well, I'm coming back with the thunder (I'm coming back)
(With the thunder, with the thunder)
Well, I'm coming back with the thunder
