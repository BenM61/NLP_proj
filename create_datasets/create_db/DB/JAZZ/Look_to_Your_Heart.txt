Look to your heart, when there are words to say
And never leave your love unspoken.
Day by day, we go our thoughtless way, and only when we pray
Do we remember those we love.

Too late to find a word that's warm and kind,
Is more than just a passing token.
Speak your love to those who seek your love,

Look to your heart, your heart will know what to say,
Look to your heart today.
