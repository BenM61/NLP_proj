I was running late for a night downtown
Me and the boys gonna tie one down
So I took a short cut through an alleyway
And this sound just took my breath away

There she stood with just one guitar
Looking much too good to be in this bar
I tried to leave but my feet were lead
And the song she played just filled my head

'Cos when she sang out that melody, I heard a sound like a backstreet symphony
My senses sung my head was spun, as I walked through the door
I gotta hear some more

So I watched the show in a state of trance
Staying 'til the end waiting for a chance
To meet with her and make her mine
And keep her there 'til the end of time

When she unfolded that melody, I heard a sound like a backstreet symphony
My destiny had guided me through the bar room door
I got to hear some more, I wanna hear some more

'Cos when she sang out that melody, I heard a sound like a backstreet symphony
My destiny had guided me through the bar room door, through the door
I gotta hear some more, I got to got to got to got to hear some more
Backstreet love...
