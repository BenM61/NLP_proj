Jean Louis Dominic Pierre Bouchon,
True to the breed that that bore him,
Answered the call that held in thrall
His father's heart before him.

Jean Louis Dominic sailed away
Further than love could find him
Yet through the night he heard a light
And gentle voice behind him say:

Matelot, Matelot, 
Where you go my thoughts go with you
Matelot, Matelot, 
When you go down to the sea

As you gaze from afar on the evening star
Wherever you may roam
You will remember the light through the winter night
That guides you safely home.

Though you find womenkind to be frail,
One love cannot fail, my son, 
'Til our days are done...

Matelot, Matelot, 
Where you go my thoughts go with you
Matelot, Matelot, 
When you go down to the sea.

Jean Louis Dominic Pierre Bouchon
Journeyed the wide world over
Lips that he kissed could not resist
This loving roving rover.

Jean Louis Dominic, right or wrong,
Ever pursued a new love
Till in his brain, there beat a strain
He knew to be his true love song:

Matelot, Matelot, 
Where you go my heart goes with you
Matelot, Matelot,
When you go down to the sea

For a year and a day you may sail away
And have no thought of me,
Yet through the wind and the spray you will hear me say
No love was ever free.

You will sigh when horizons are clear,
Something that is dear to me
Cannot let me be,

Matelot, Matelot, 
Where you go my heart goes with you
Matelot, Matelot 
When you go down to the sea.

Matelot, Matelot, 
Where you go my heart will follow
Matelot, Matelot, 
When you go down to the sea

When there's grief in the sky and the waves ride high
My heart to yours will say
You may be sure that I'm true to my love for you
Though half the world away.

Never mind if you find other charms,
Here within my arms you'll sleep,
Sailor from the deep...

Matelot, Matelot, 
Where you go my heart will follow
Matelot, Matelot, 
When you go down to the sea
