It's a long time since I saw you
Well

You know how time can fly.
It seems like yesterday we were lovers

Now we pass each other by.
But if we're left alone tonight
Don't ask me to hold you tight.

I go weak
I go weak
I go weak

I go weak
Weak in the presence of beauty.

All of my friends keep asking why
I'm quiet when you're around.
But they don't know I think
I'm so lucky to stop myself from falling down.

So later if you're on your own
Don't ask me to take you home.
I go weak
I go weak
I go weak

'Cause if we're left alone tonight
I have no choice but to hold you tight.
I go weak
I go weak
I go weak

I go weak
I go weak
I go weak

I go weak
I go weak
I go weak
