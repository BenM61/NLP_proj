You know big money I get dat
Got my feet up when I kick back
Get major bread for my chit chat
Got Miss Keri baby on this track
What colours in this season?
Think I'll go tear up Neimans
Miami in the mornin', be in St Tropez this evenin'
I know you like my style, my million dollar smile
Hit any party red carpet, bet I shut that down
Don't hate just go get yours
No excuses no more
I just dropped another hit
'Cause I'm that million dollar chick

I'm off in another world, so far out this atmosphere
I could throw a hundred million out the cockpit of my Leer
That's dirty money (uh uh)
You starving hungry (that's right)
I got a million in singles
Take it all off, shake it for me
No renting, my millions hydroplaning 
And I'm done with St Tropez'ng
In my Lambo' Ice Capadin'
I'm richer than all the riches in the world
You ain't no groupie and I ain't tryna buy you
I'm tryna slide you up out them Gucci

Baby if I want it, I got it
'Cause I'll be gettin' some more

He shower me in diamonds, I vacation for months
Penthouse at the Trump, in Las Vegas I'm Lady Luck
Million dollar slab, I know I got you feinding
These shades is YSL
These heels ain't out 'til next season
I'm in that pink Ferrari, I got a thing for Porsches
I like my men like my cars, strong and built like horses
Glass of Nuvo, I'm far from average
Rich and lavish, that's why I am the baddest bitch
