Ooh, Sunday morning 
You;re gonna find my love shining on you 

Oh, I'm waiting 
And my heart is anticipating 
Your face 
On my pillow 
Feel sunshine pouring through the window 

Like the grapes on the vine 
Love gets sweeter with time 
You were made to love 

Ooh, Sunday morning (I'll see you Sunday morning) 
Ooh, Sunday morning 
It's like the best of everything falling on you 

Your eyes 
Shining on me 
You're the brightest star, that ever could be 
Your kiss 
Oh, I'm so thankful 
The love that we share, I'm sincerely grateful 

The wind blowin' in the tree 
Singing love songs to me 
Singing you were made to love 

Ooh, Sunday morning (I'll see you Sunday morning) 
You're gonna find my love shining on you 
Ooh, Sunday morning 
It's like the best of everything falling on you 

Ooh, Sunday morning (I'll see you Sunday morning) 
When we shared sweet love like no other 

Ooh, Sunday morning 
Like a summer day with your lover 
Ooh Sunday morning (I'll see you Sunday morning) 
When we shared sweet love like no other
