[Verse 1]
Summertime 
Outside 
Makin' love while the rain is fallin' 
Touch me, gently 
You know me, don't care who's watchin' 
Loathing, all night, close your eyes & find my body 
Whisper to me that you want it 
Baby, baby 
Heart be pounding when you near me 
Feel so weak I need you wit me 
When I think of sexy, I think of you 

[Chorus]
Wanna know can you keep it up 
Cause tonight I'm fellin oh so sexy 
In the mood for makin' love 
Wide open, look at how you got me 
Can't wait 'til I get home 
Need to feel your body wrapped around me 
Gotta know can you keep it up 
Cause tonight I'm feelin' oh so sexy 

[Verse 2]
Let go love, want it so don't try to bite it 
Just you, it's just us, that's the way I know you like it 
Slowly, so deep, boy look what you up and started 
Don't you even think of stoppin'
Baby, baby 
Heart be pounding when you near me 
Feel so weak I need you wit me 
When I think of sexy, I think of you 

[Chorus]
Wanna know can you keep it up 
Cause tonight I'm fellin oh so sexy 
In the mood for makin' love 
Wide open, look at how you got me 
Can't wait 'til I get home 
Need to feel your body wrapped around me 
Gotta know can you keep it up 
Cause tonight I'm feelin' oh so sexy 

[Bridge] 
Just as soon as we hit the door 
Our clothes are off and on the floor 
I can't help in, in the way I do, about you 
My neck, my back, I'm sick & red 
Don't think, boy make you deal with it 
Can't help it, I'm all for you 

[Chorus]
Wanna know can you keep it up 
Cause tonight I'm fellin oh so sexy 
In the mood for makin' love 
Wide open, look at how you got me 
Can't wait 'til I get home 
Need to feel your body wrapped around me 
Gotta know can you keep it up 
Cause tonight I'm feelin' oh so sexy
