You're such a shy boy
You know you should be mine
When you're finished being self-obsessed 
Then let me know
All my crushes are about you
You're such a shy boy
You know you should be mine
Well I feel like an android after I cut off all of my hair
When you're not there
All my crushes are about you
Watch me weightless
I get nervous and have a cigarette
Watch me weightless
I think for less so I can love you more 
Suddenly every jumper I fold fills with your torso
And I hold it
All my crushes are about you
