Can I fix it and still care?
Can I run and you'll be there?
Wish that I could run and hide
Juggling messages inside
Stalling, trying to buy more time

Can I be a part of you?
How to get there, what to do?
Can I get there from inside?
Of all the ways I could have tried
Can I be there all the time?

Is it all me?
Is it all me?
Is it all me?
Is it all me?

Can I feel another way?
Can I bring out to stay?
Can you capture what I've done?
Play it back so I don't run
Now I'm walking on the sun (?)

Is it all me?
Is it all me?
Is it all me?
Is it all me?

It's not mine
Take me fine
With a smile
Been there all the time

Is it all me?
Is it all me?
Is it all me?
Is it all me?
