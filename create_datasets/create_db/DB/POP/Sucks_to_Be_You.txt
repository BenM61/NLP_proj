(Tamara) - Sucks To Be You
(Simon) - I know, I know
(Tamara) - Sucks To Be You
(Simon) - I know it's true
I'm a bastard if it's true
If the thing she did to me
Is what I did to you
I'm a bastard if it's true
And I guess it's true
(Tamara) - Sucks To Be You
(Simon) - I know, I know
(Tamara) - Sucks To Be You
(Simon) - I know it's true
You need to know I finally understand
And I gotta get in touch with you now
But I can't
I just want to tell you I'm sorry

I'm a bastard if it's true
If the thing she did to me
Was what I did to you
I'm a bastard if it's true
And I guess it's true
(Tamara) - Sucks To Be You
(Simon) - I know, I know
(Tamara) - Sucks To Be You
(Simon) - I know it's true
You need to know I finally understand
And I gotta get in touch with you now
But I can't
I wish I could have made you happy
But I'm a bastard

I'm not saying that I wanted you to stay
But tonight I feel like driving my car to LA
Just so you can see me crying
Cause I'm a bastard if it's true
Yeah and I guess it's true
(Tamara) - Sucks To Be You
(Tamara) - Sucks To Be You
(Simon) - I know it's true
(Tamara) - Sucks To Be You
(Simon) - I know, I know
(Tamara) - Sucks To Be You
(Simon) - I know it's true
