Far, far from the light
Hear the night creatures call
With a cold breath they howl
All the hollow hours
They're calling you

I'll be there
No matter what your going through
In the dark I care
I'm holding on, I'm hoping on
It's still the same old me inside

Back to the Light
Back to the streets that are paved with gold
Back to the Light
Back to the land where the sunshine heals my soul

Deep deep in the night
When the world fills with tears
And the wind blows
Colder and colder it grows
And the fire dims
With the same old fears

I'll be there
Though maybe you don't hear me babe
I still care
No matter when, I'll still be there
When you make it to the other side
I'm going back

Back to the Light
Back to the light
Back to the streets that are paved with gold
Back to the Light
Goin' back to the land
Where the sunshine heals my soul

On and on
Searching for a clearer view
Winning and losing an inner war
Wonder what we do it for
Though the road seems never ending
Hold on to the hope I'm sending through

No matter what your going through
In the dark I care
I'm holding on, believe it
We'll be walking in the light
'Cause they'll be no place left to hide

Back to the Light
Back to the streets that are paved with gold
Back to the Light
I'm goin' back to land
Where the sunshine heals my soul
Yeah yeah yeah

Back to the light
