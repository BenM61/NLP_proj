When we're discovering lies
Our pride will be in vain
Now, recirculate your thoughts
Make them new again
Well, do you know where to start
And do you see the end
You're swallowing books
This is just like the last
And you're wasting your time
In searching for your past
Well, do you know where to start
And do you see the end

And when we return
We are all ashamed
Because the promises of life
We'll never forget
And all that you say
Discloses what we are
We know our sheets will always
Maintain blank

When do you hide in your dreams
Do you look behind
Play around with the truth
Constructed in your mind
Well, do you know where to start
And do you see the end

And when we return
We are all ashamed
Because the promises of life
We'll never forget
And all that you say
Discloses what we are
We know our sheets will always
Maintain blank
