Why you say yes
When you know you mean no
Then you say you will, but you won't
(Lies, lies, lies, lies, lies)
And all you gonna do, but you don't
(You never do)
You say that you know, but you don't know
I can smell your funk through the window
(Jesus)
And I know that you're busy, and it sucks ?
And I know you'll swap a kidney for a stone
Well, I saw you swap a kidney for a phone

Well, nanananaaa nana na
Nanananaaa nana na nana na
Why you say yes
When you know you mean no
Why you say yes
When you know you that you know

Why do you say yeah
When you you mean no
I can even smell the smell through the window
(For the funk the funk of it)
You say you will, but you won't
And if you're gonna get out, then don't

Misleadin' deceivin'
Goin' to the top
Your misdemeanors just won't stop
Blast off your socks
You sell your kidney for rock

Nanananaaa nana na
Nanananaaa nana na nana na
Why you say yes
When you know you mean no
Why you say yes when you mean no
Why you know you that you know

Snake eyes, foretold
Step to the gate, cause you know you're tellin' lies
Snake eyes, foretold
Step to the gate, cause you know you're tellin' lies
Snake eyes, foretold
Step to the gate, cause you know you're tellin' lies

Why you say yes
Why you know you mean no
Why you say yes when you mean no
Why you know you that you know

Why you say yes
Why you know you mean no
Why you say yes when you mean no
Why you know you, yes, you know
