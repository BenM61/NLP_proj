We've got the groovy potential

Another long night
Or another mystery
Tell me babe, tell me
What's it gonna be?

We've got the groovy potential
Can't you hear the sound?
You better get up, get up, get up
So we can get down

We've got the groovy potential
C'mon baby
Let's keep it down

There's no time for sleeping
'Cause the night is so young
It's time for you and me
To have a little fun

'Cause you and me we've got the groovy potential
Can't you hear the sound?
It's time to get up, get up, get up
So we can get down

We've got the groovy potential
(Groovy, groovy)
(Groovy potential)
(I like it when you dance for me)

(You've got the groovy potential)
(I can't (?), but I'm going to talk about it)

You're bodies are moving
I know by heart
And it's hard to stop ya
Once the moving starts

We've got the groovy potential
I've learned my lines
And I'm ready to play my part

C'mon, we've got the groovy potential

I was trying so hard now not to
But I got to groovy potential

I can't take another long lonely night
C'mon baby, c'mon baby
Treat me right, treat me right
We've got to groovy potential

(You want to get down?)
