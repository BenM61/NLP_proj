Yo, met this piece by the name of Sharise 
She had a fly one hundred ninety restin' in Jones Beach 
You know when we kickin' my everyday cliche 
Yo boo, can I poly with you, what make my day 
She threw her chin up in the air, said yeah 
Your style is played out, black, like last year 
What do you mean huh? You know what I mean Dunn 
Callin' me Dunn had me open like I was the one 
What did I have on God Guard or Clairborne 
You know you had that rugged type of shit on Raekwon 
Maybe I talk a bit, kick a few words and shit 
But you drove off in some Nissan phat shit 
Givin' me bad looks, lookin' like mad crooks 
If I was a purse downtown I would have been took 
Yeah from robsters, but you look like mobsters 
Smokin' that weed had me nauseous like rastas 

When we're together you blow my mind, uh huh 
You have that way about ya that keeps me satisfied (Whatcha want) 
All I want to do is give you all I got 

If I give you all I got would you be there for me baby (All I got) 
And if I keep you close to me would you give me everything I need 
The way I want it to be (That's the way it should be) 

I want to be there for you boy in every way 
I just gotta tell you how you take my breath away 
Oh I want to let you know 
When you walked into my life (Walked into my life) 
I had this feeling you brought my world alive 
And I'm going crazy, my head is in a daze (Head is in a daze) 
You amaze me, boy why don't you stay (Boy why don't you stay) 

If I give you all I got would you be there for me baby (All I got) 
And if I keep you close to me would you give me everything I need 
The way I want it to be (That's the way it should be) 

She's a fly fabulous bird from outta nowhere 
We bungalo dolo in logear, free parole the whole year 
Now acknowledge me God mentality, fly formality 
Cut out on me, I'm kidnappin' half of your salary 
We movin' like this, for real now shut down your will power 
Flower whatever you doin' don't disrespect ours 
Slidin' my work to the next man 
Still I'm givin' you props now gets your karats on the nightstand 

When you walked into my life (Walked into my life) 
I had this feeling you brought my world alive 
And I'm going crazy, my head is in a daze (Head is in a daze) 
You amaze me, boy why don't you stay (Boy why don't you stay) 

If I give you all I got would you be there for me baby (All I got) 
And if I keep you close to me would you give me everything I need 
The way I want it to be (That's the way it should be) 

If I give you all I got would you be there for me baby (All I got) 
And if I keep you close to me would you give me everything I need 
The way I want it to be (That's the way it should be)
