I'm trying to control myself
So please don't stand in my way
I've waited for the longest time
This is what I wanted in my way

Move over, move over
There's a climax coming in my way
Move over, move over
There's a climax coming in my way

I don't like you, don't compromise
Shattered by your weakness
Shattered by your smile
And I'm not very fond of you, and your lies
Shattered by your weaknesses
Shattered by your smile

All the kids are going back to school
The summer's over it's the golden rule
And now I'm coming out to play
So please don't stand in my way
And all the things that seemed once to be
So important to me
Seem so trivial now that I can see

Move over, move over
There's a climax coming my way
Move over, move over
There's a climax coming my way

I don't like you, don't compromise
Shattered by your weakness
Shattered by your smile
And I'm not very fond of you, and your lies
Shattered by your weaknesses
Shattered by your smile
Shattered by your weaknesses
Shattered by your smile
Shattered by your weaknesses
I was Shattered by your smile
Shattered by your weaknesses
I was Shattered by your smile

Please don't stand in my way
