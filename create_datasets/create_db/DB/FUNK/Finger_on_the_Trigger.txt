(I've) hung around with big shots
Never knew love was in the sights
I guess I missed the target
Caught up in a different line of fire

But I know since I've been aiming
For the sweetness in your soul
Your name is on the bullet
And it's gettin' ready to explode
There's been a change inside my life
And I just want to let you know

I've got my finger on the trigger
Love is in control
I've got my finger on the trigger
I ain't lettin' go

Bass Line:
Baby, let's have some fun
A won't cha be my, my
Number one

Mama used to tell me
Girl, you better load your gun up right
She said ya, ya gotta come out smokin'
Hit it with your best shot every time
Well I didn't understand her
'Til you walked right into range
I saw your love at twenty paces
And I new I'd won the game
You better raise your heart up high
Or love will blow you right away

I've got my finger on the trigger
Love is in control
I've got my finger on the trigger
I ain't lettin' go
I've got my finger on the trigger
Love is in control
I've got my finger on the trigger
I ain't lettin' go

Leave off that safety catch
There ain't no risk
We're gonna have some fun
I've got cha, love's begun
So stay with me
Until the mornin' sun

You're super bullet number one
Bass Line:
Baby, let's have some fun
A won't cha be my, my
Number one
There's been a change inside
My life
And I just want to let you know

I've got my finger on the trigger
Love is in control
I've got my finger on the trigger
I ain't lettin' go
I've got my finger on the trigger
Love is in control
I've got my finger on the trigger
I ain't lettin' go
