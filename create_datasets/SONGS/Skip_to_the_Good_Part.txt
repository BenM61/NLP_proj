I never thought I'd find the hands to hold my heart
Whaddya know? We'll skip to the good part
Where we are here and now
What's to come, butterflies
I hope these words will give you something to hold onto

I give you my love, I give you my heart
Let's skip to the good part
I do and a kiss and forever starts
Let's skip to the good part,
I'm so ready, o-oh, I'm so ready, I'm so ready
Let's skip to the good part

With a kiss, the eyes have gotten everyone say this
"you're my all", cliches I thought 
I fall so hard so fast
Based on my past, first love and last
Ring slips on, my eyes are on you

I give you my love, I give you my heart
Let's skip to the good part
I do and a kiss and forever starts
Let's skip to the good part,
I'm so ready, o-oh, I'm so ready, I'm so ready
Let's skip to the good part
Let's skip to the good part

It hurt when my heart was broken for the first time
Crush so hard kinda shocked that I'm alright
Made you mine now it's time to realize
That I'm never going back, no I'm never going back
To the girl that lacked faith in romance
I'm done let's dance
Keep it up- take a chance
I'm yours
I'm all yours

I give you my love, I give you my heart
Let's skip to the good part
I do and a kiss and forever starts
Let's skip to the good part,
I'm so ready, o-oh, I'm so ready, I'm so ready
Let's skip to the good part

Take my hand and lets get away from this place
Your face is the only thing that I need to be truly happy 

Take my hand and lets get away from this place
Your face is the only thing that I need to be truly happy 

Take my hand and lets get away from this place
Your face is the only thing that I need to be truly happy 

I'm so ready
I'm so ready
