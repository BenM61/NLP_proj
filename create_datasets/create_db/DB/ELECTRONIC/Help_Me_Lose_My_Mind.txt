Talk to me and watch me crumble
You will see you got mine down

Faithfully I will look over
There I'll find what you've become

(What you've become)

You help me lose my mind
And you believe something I can't define
Help me lose my mind, make me run back
What if all before
Keep, I need more time
How much longer
Who I've been waiting for

Jealousy will be washed over
Carefully we look on through

Could it be easy to start over
Somehow I will bring you too

(What you've become)

You help me lose my mind
And you believe something I can't define
Help me lose my mind, make me run back
What if all before
Keep, I need more time
How much longer
Who I've been waiting for

Who I've been waiting
I've been waiting waiting waiting
I've been waiting waiting waiting
I've been waiting waiting waiting
I've been waiting waiting waiting
I've been waiting waiting waiting
I've been waiting waiting waiting
I've been waiting waiting waiting

You help me lose my mind
And you believe something I can't define
Help me lose my mind, make me run back
What if all before
Keep, I need more time
How much longer
Who I've been waiting for
(How much longer)
