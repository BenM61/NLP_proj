It's in the air, super still
The calm before the hunter kill
The sky will crack, the earth might split
I feel a dread in my stomach pit

It's about to happen
It's about to show
Can you feel it tighten?
Can you feel it grow?

Tension mounts, about to blow
Tension builds, crescendo
I can't contain it, I'm fit to burst
All supernova in a big bang fest

I can't explain it
I can't contain it
Right here, right now
In the here and now

It's about to happen
It's about to show
Can you feel it tighten?
Can you feel it grow?

Get up, get out
Don't hang about
Get up, get out

It's in the air, super still
The calm before
The sky will crack, the earth might split
I feel a dread

Get up, get out
Don't hang about
Get up, get out

Get up, get out
Don't hang about
Get up, get out
