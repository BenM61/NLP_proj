I want to see where the river goes 
Take a paper boat to the coast 
Under streets I will ride the ghost 
Down the tunnels that no one knows 

Boredom and joy 
That's freedom 

So we hide what we need the most 
Build the cities right on the source 
Walls and streets turn them into ghosts 
The invisible city's soul 

Boredom and joy 
That's freedom 

I want to see where the river goes
