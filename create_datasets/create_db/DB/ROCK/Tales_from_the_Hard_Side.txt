Your cards were dealt when
You drove through the night
As a man in dark clothes came into your sight
The barrel tapped the glass
You reached the window lock
Get the f*ck out the car
And leave it in the crosswalk
He climbed into your seat
And dropped a vial of crack
Pissin' down your leg, you're a victim of carjack
Feel the cold steel as I pull the hammer back
Bang! You're fuckin' dead 'cause it's like that

Society, pushed him down and out
Soul provider what's it all about
Religion, faith can we do without
Social pressure we're too strung out

Another bad hand the cards have been dealt
Kid of fourteen, high aspirations held
To get ahead and run shit with his powerful will
Told by his role model, you're old enough to kill
See my ride, my bitches and my loot
If ya want to survive be prepared to shoot
Stay hard like me, you're bound to do well
A waste of precious life, twenty five and an L

I'll put a bullet in your head for the colour of your skin
This is my neighborhood who the f*ck let you in
I'll stick with mine stay with your own kind
The virus of hate infects the ignorant mind
