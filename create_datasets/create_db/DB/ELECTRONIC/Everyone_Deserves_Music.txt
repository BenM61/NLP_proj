Everyone deserves music, sweet music
Everyone deserves music, sweet music

Seven in the morn', step on the floor
Walk into the kitchen and you open the door
There ain't much left in the bottle of juice
Because the seeds that you planted never reproduced

Computer still runnin' but your mind has crashed
Because the plans that you made never came to pass
Now you recognizing the times is hard
When you tryin' to take a bite out of your ATM card

Everyone deserves music, sweet music
Everyone deserves music, sweet music

Ginny's home life wouldn't stabilize
At the age of 15 learned to drink and drive
No one ever could seem to empathize
Makin' babies in the back seat on tranquilizers

Papa never was much a rolling stone see
He just like to sit and drink alone
Mama always tried to do the best she could
She would work all day and then come home to cook but

We all vain, we all strange
We all drained, we all love to just complain
But nobody wants to seem to get along, ya see
We got shame, we got pain
We got blame, we all a little bit insane
So that's why I sing this song ya know because

Everyone deserves music, sweet music
Everyone deserves music, sweet music
Even our worst enemies Lord, they deserve music, music
Even the quiet ones in our family, they deserve music

So I pray for them and I play for them
So I pray for them and I play for them

We all vain, we all strange
We all drained, we all love to just complain
But nobody wants to seem to get along, ya see

We got shame, we got pain
We got blame, we all a little bit insane
So that's why I sing this song ya know because

Everyone deserves music, sweet music
Everyone deserves music, sweet music
Even our worst enemies Lord, they deserve music, music
And even the quiet ones in our family, they deserve music

Everyone deserves music, sweet music
Even our worst enemies Lord, they deserve music, music
And even the quiet ones in our family, they deserve music

So if you're feelin' down and out, got no place to go now
Just sing along to the music y'all, let it fill your soul now
Because everyone deserves music, sweet music

Even the quiet ones, the lonely ones
The happy ones ain't the only ones, y'all
Everyone deserves music
