Nobody wants to be with somebody
That lets you have your way all the time
You know
Everybody wants to be with somebody that's strong
True story
'Cause when you're weak
You need somebody that's gonna pick you up
And make you complete (uh, yeah)

There's been times 
That you flipped on me 
'Cause I was wrong
And I like it (and I liked it)
There's been times I've called
And it went straight to voicemail
And I liked it (and I liked it)
There's been times
You gave me closure, apologized
Then you cried on my shoulder
And I was in your driveway
Before you fixed your lips to say come over
No matter what it is, I'm there for you

Hold up, wait a minute
Shh, shh, let me finish
I just wanna holla at you
I bet you finish my sentence
'Cause you know where my mind is (you know)
Baby you know where my heart lives
With you

You make my life complete (everything)
You make everything sour-sweet (everything)
You are everything (you're my everything)
Baby you make every day complete
You make my life complete
Baby you bring out the best in me
You are everything (everything)
Baby you make every day complete

There's been times
People try to come between us
And I can't stand it (I can't stand it)
Sometimes I feel
Like the world is against us
I can't understand it (damn it)
But you always find a way
To escape the world
You love your homies
But you never put them before your girl
You said the beauty in me
Outweighs the wrong
And you've been waitin'
For somebody like me so long
Come sit between my legs
And let me rub you
No need to argue
I just wanna love you (love you boy)
All I can do is think about you
Baby, I'm too optimistic to doubt you

You make my life complete (complete)
You make everything sour-sweet (everything, everything)
You are everything
Baby you make every day complete (everything)
You make my life complete
Baby you bring out the best in me
You are everything
Baby you make every day complete

You are everything
And everything is you (everything is you)
You're a part of all my dreams
You're in my heart
And can't be removed
You mean the world to me
And every word I say is true (everything)
You are everything (oh yeah)
And everything is you

You make my life complete
You make everything sour-sweet (you, you, you)
You are everything
Baby you make every day complete
You make my life complete (you)
Baby you bring out the best in me (everything, everything)
You are everything (everything)
Baby you make every day complete
Thank you

Now I hope I made a statement (yeah)
That love
It will never go out of style
And strength
Strength will carry you
You understand
If you're a real man you do
Now I want you to ask yourself
Do you deserve me
Can you make me complete
We'll see
