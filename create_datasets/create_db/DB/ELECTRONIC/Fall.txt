Come, come closer now lover
Y'know I need you next to me
Eyes across the room can feel so far away
All desires I feel, I don't have the words to say
Baby, when you're near, you get me close to it

In your arms I'll fall
All the way to hell
Like two soft bodies
In those arms I found my love
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Fall, all the way down
Like two soft bodies
In this hell we found our heaven
Oh oh oh oh

Darling it was on a night like this
I remember we first touched
Fearless in the face of all hostilities
And on this runaway train, only need you next to me
Speeding as we watch them fade to history

In your arms I'll - fall - all the way to hell
Like two soft bodies
Cause in those arms, I found my love
Oh oh oh oh
Fall, all the way down
Like two soft bodies
In this hell we found our heaven
Oh oh oh oh
All, all the way to hell
Like two soft bodies
In this hell we found our heaven, heaven, heaven in it
(All the) (All the)
Oh oh oh oh

Let's fall, all the way to hell
Like two soft bodies
In your arms I found my love
Oh oh oh oh
We fall, all the way down
Like two soft bodies
In this hell we found our heaven, heaven, heaven
