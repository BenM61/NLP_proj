Oh no no no no
Don't come near me, don't come near me, don't come near me
Mm mm, no no

I thought of leaving, I want key
I wanted world, I want it all ,I want to live
She got a grievance, she want the kid
She want the key, she want the car, she want the crib
I got a bit it might be about that
And my moves need to be about that
Somebody pulling me to feel yo yo
Try to leave but I still don't go

Even if I wanted to, I come back around
Even if I wanted to, I come back and
We just go around, baby
Bang, bang boomerang
Do you love me or hate me now, baby
Bang, bang boomerang
I can't believe it all began with a joke and champagne
I really never cared about it
But if you plantin', I'm plantain

Ooh, you got me feeling like boomerang
Bomerang, boomerang, boomerang, 'rang
Ooh, you got me feeling like boomerang
Bomerang, boomerang, boomerang, 'rang

I've got no need to pretend I
I've got no need to pretend I
I've got no need to pretend I
She want the key, she want the car, she want the crib
I got a bit it might be about that
And my moves might be about that
Somebody pulling me to feel yo yo
Try to leave but I still don't go

Even if I wanted to, I come back around
Even if I wanted to, I come back and
We just go around, baby
Bang, bang boomerang
Do you love me or hate me now, baby
Bang, bang boomerang
I can't believe it all began with a joke and champagne
I really never cared about it
But if you plantin', I'm plantain

Ooh, you got me feeling like boomerang
Bomerang, boomerang, 'rang
Got me feeling like boomerang
Bomerang, boomerang, boomerang, 'rang

Lookin' out of the window, 'bout the things I do
Lookin' out of the window, 'bout the things I do
I'm taking my secrets, I got this, I don't need friends
You taught me that I need them
'Cause everything comes back around baby

Bang, bang boomerang
Do you love me or hate me now, baby
Bang, bang boomerang
I can't believe it all began with a joke and champagne
I really never cared about it
You be plantin' a plantain

Bomerang, boomerang, boomerang, 'rang
Got me feeling like boomerang
Bomerang, boomerang, boomerang, bang
