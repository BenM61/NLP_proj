I'm an English boy
I was brought up right
Hold me down
And I will bite
I know no fear
I serve with joy
I'm proud to be here
An English boy

I feel like a stray dog
Blurred like a movie
You say you've come to arrest me
But you're just trying to test me
I'm bored with your prejudice
Spreading like a fever
Your promises to train me
Are just attempts to restrain me

I'm an English boy
Precisely made
Pin me down
I am not afraid
I show no fear
I will serve with joy
I'm proud to be here
An English boy

Use me like a headline
Cut pieces to pieces
I'm black on the tube line
Red on the touch-line
Freezing up the future
Stopping every stopwatch
You say we're moving like an oil slick
Thicker than a house brick

I'm an English boy
I was brought up right
If you raise your dress
Then I will bite
My voice is clear
I got perfect poise
Good to be down here
With all the English boys

And I don't know where I am now
Or where I'm gonna go
I just keep going round and round on the circle line
Like some demented kind a cummuta
Trying to avoid paying for my ticket
I'm a lost soul
I read about myself in the newspapers
I'm a pig
I'm a thug
I've got nowhere to go but down

Feel like I'm kicking at a dead man
Kicking in the chorus
I'm broken by hatred
While politicians just ignore us
You never gave me any value
You didn't give me any reason
There's no tools and no toys
For any English boys

I'm an English boy
I was brought up right
Hold me down
And I will bite
I know no fear
I will serve with joy
I'm proud to be here
An English boy

I'm an English boy
I'm an English boy
I'm an English boy
No tools, no toys for any English boy
English boy
