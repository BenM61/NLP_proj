Oh, the night is slipping away, femme jolie, femme jolie
And there's still so much left to say, femme jolie, femme jolie
Oh, we haven't got time, 'cause I'll be gone in the sunshine.

Oh my love, you've been good to me, femme jolie, femme jolie
I could love you so easily, femme jolie, femme jolie
Oh, what can I do now? Then I'm tellin' you now.

I'm only sugar on Sunday, I'm leavin' on Monday,
Only got one day to love me, yeah.
Sugar on Sunday, I'm leavin' on Monday,
But I'll be your man tonight.

And the night is never to wait, femme jolie, femme jolie
Love me now, before it's too late, femme jolie, femme jolie
But we haven't got time, I'll be gone in the sunshine.

I'm only sugar on Sunday, I'm leavin' on Monday,
Only got one day to love me, yeah.
Sugar on Sunday, I'm leavin' on Monday,
But I'll be your man tonight.

Oh, sugar on Sunday, I'm leavin' on Monday,
Only got one day to love me, yeah.
