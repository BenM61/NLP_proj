Promise 
Welcome to a world of promise 
These smiling faces are your friends 
All this happiness is certain 
Unless of course you don't fit in 

Fall in line 
Pretend like you don't mind 
Get in the know unless you've had enough time to get dangerous 

Laughing 
Why are all these dudes so happy 
Our hero questions the big joke 
Stop it make them all just disappear 
He's never felt so all alone 
Now's the time 
There's not need to hide 
He's got to let them know 
Look's like he's had enough 
He's getting dangerous 
I wonder who's laughing now
