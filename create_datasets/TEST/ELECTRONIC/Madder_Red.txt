(Ooh)
(Ooh)
(Ooh)
(Ooh)

Even when my luck is down
I take joy in that our love grows
But if my vices are a burden
Please don't let me off
Cast me from your home

(Ooh)
(Ooh)
(Ooh)
(Ooh)

Because lately I've wronged you
And not been on your side, love
Maybe I have been dumb
Please don't ask me why

I turn away just when you want me
And I know that home is where you want me
There's not much for me there

Never gave a thought to an honorable living
Always had sense enough to lie
It's getting hard to keep pretending I'm worth your time

(Ooh)
(Ooh)
(Ooh)
(Ooh)

Never gave a thought to an honorable living
Always had sense enough to lie
It's getting hard to keep pretending I'm worth your time

Because lately I've wronged you
And not been on your side, love
Maybe I have been dumb
Please don't ask me why
Please don't ask me why
Please don't ask me why
Please don't ask me
