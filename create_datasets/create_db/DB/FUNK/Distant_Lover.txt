Distant lover, lover
(Lover, lover, lover)
So many miles away
Heaven knows that I long for you
Every night, every night
I plan, sometimes I dance
Through the day

Distant lover, lover
(Lover, lover, lover)
You should think about me
And say a prayer for me
Please, please baby
Think about me sometimes
Think about me here
Here in misery
Misery

As I reminisce, oh baby
Through our joyful summer together
The promises we made
All the daily letters
Then, all of the sudden
Everything seemed to explode
Now, I gaze out my window
Sugar, down a lonesome road

Distant lover
(Lover, lover, lover)
Sugar, how can you treat my heart
So mean and cruel
Sugar, sugar
That every moment that I spent with you
I treasure every like it was a precious jewel
(Please) Lord have mercy

Please, come back, baby
Somethin' I wanna say
When you left
You took all of me with you
Do you wanna hear me scream
Please please oh please baby
Come back and hold me, girl
