You thought you'd set the bar
I'd never tried to work it out 
We just lit the fire and now you want to put it out 
You gave it all you got
And all you got is not enough 
Why don't you hand it over
Time is up, you've had your shot 
Gather once again 
Disasters in the end
It's like a default 

You thought you'd make the grade
Oh, your start to fade 
We threw it in the fire
It's better that it not remain 
You just brought together
Didn't seem to have the heart 
We use like coming off now
You that it would fall apart 
Take one for the team you're a cog in the machine
It's like a default 
Take one for the team you're a cog in the machine
It's like a default 

You've missed the starting on
For everything you ever done 
You took part in the race
But disappeared without a trace 
You thought you'd set the bar
I'd never tried to work it out 
We just lit the fire and now you want to put it out 
Forget about the cause
Press rewind then stop and pause 
It's like a default 
Forget about the cause
Press rewind then stop and pause 
It's like a default
