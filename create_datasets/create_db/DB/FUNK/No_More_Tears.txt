We used to laugh
Now I all I do is cry
You used to make me so happy
Now you don't even try

You're hurting me, yeah
You're doing me wrong
I can see it in your eyes
Soon you're gonna be gone
And I know I'm gonna miss you
My love I will send with you
'Cause I've been down too long
And you keep doin' me

And there will be no tears for you
Gonna be no more crying now
Gonna be no more tears for you
See my eyes have run dry

And there's no more tears
And no more saddened eyes
From crying through the night
Gonna gather up, gather up my feelings
And lock them all inside
So when you say you're leaving
And you walk out my door
I'll say to myself
You can not hurt me anymore

And I know I should be crying
But instead I'm slowly dying
'Cause all my love has gone
From two hearts so badly torn

And there will be no tears for you
Gonna be no more crying now
Gonna be no more tears for you
See my eyes have run dry

And I know I'm gonna miss you
But for love I got me someone else
'Cause I been down, been down too long
And you, you keep doing me wrong

And there will be no tears for you
Gonna be no more crying now
Gonna be no more tears for you
See my eyes have run dry

And there will be no tears for you
Gonna be no more crying now
Gonna be no more tears for you
See my eyes have run dry

Ain't nobody cryin'
Dry, my eyes
Lord knows it's gonna be fine
It's gonna be alright after a while
I'm gonna be alright if you would leave
Surely won't you try, surely won't you, baby won't you try
I'm gonna be alright
Lord knows I don't need you no more, baby
I'm gonna make it on my own.
