Put my beat down through the floor, 
Shoot that bugger out the door, 
Electric shake it down and out, 
And freakin' dance till we're no whores 
Kick my beat down through the floor, 
Shoot that bugger out the door 
Electric shake it down and out 
And freakin' dance till we're no whores? 

Oh 6-2-3 now don't judge we're spittin' our sleaze across the safety 
No new ideas they're all the same here 
And then shake your shit and open your ears? 
Oh 6-2-3 now don't judge me we're spittin' our sleaze across the safety 
No new ideas they're all the same here 
And then shake your shit and open your ears

Let you kick up and down, let you shake down and out 
Let you kick up and down, and then shake us down and then shake us down.
