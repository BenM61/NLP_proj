With our hands
and call it broken promised land
I heard the whispers on the wind
he told me how or this would end

hey, our eye on the horizon
don't stop until it's gone
hey, our eye on the horizon

and think alone now on our hearts
and give a peace recover every day
and we both fight and no one sees
that's free ourselves away from here

hey, our eye on the horizon
don't stop until it's gone
hey, our eye on the horizon

hey, our eye on the horizon
don't stop until it's gone
hey, our eye on the horizon

hey,

hey,
