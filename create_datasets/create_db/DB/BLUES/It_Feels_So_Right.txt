Step in these arms
Where you belong
It feels so right 
So right
How can it be wrong?

There's something in the way you kiss
That makes me want to hold you tight
I know that nothing can't be wrong
That feels so right

Each time we touch 
You thrill me so
It means so much 
So much
I can't let you go

This isn't only for tonight
We're gonna love our whole life through
'Cause baby, if it feels so right
How can it be wrong?

This isn't only for tonight
We're gonna love our whole life long
'Cause baby, if it feels so right
How can it be wrong? Oh yeah
