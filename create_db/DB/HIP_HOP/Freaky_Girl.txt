[Verse]
High heels gosh you look sexy 
I'd steal a touch if you let me 
I'm just dyin' to kick it with you girl 
Hey boo show me you're ready 
Lips looking juicy like cherry 
I can almost taste your flavor girl 

[hook]
But it seems like you're the wrong type 
Don't you ever get upset girl I'd like to see you sweat 
It just feels like you're too uptight 
Girl you're too conservative and that ain't how I want to live 

[chorus]
I want to a freaky girl somebody just like me 
Someone who understands just what a player needs 
Ain't with those perfect girls that shit don't click with me 
A very naughty girl that's what I need 

[verse]
Handcuffs can you get freaky 
How far will you go to please me 
Whips and chains girl are you down with that 
Strange places searching for pleasure 
I want you to meet me wherever 
Wearing just an overcoat and hat 

[hook]
Or was I right you're the wrong type 
You don't ever get upset I ain't never seen you sweat 
It just feels like you're too uptight 
Girl you're too conservative and that ain't how I want to live 

[chorus]
Want a girl fi love mi up hug mi up give it to me right
Swing from me shower curtain and from mi light
Hot piece of loving cerry me right through the night

Really love it when you climb pam me haa 
Cause me know you naw go hide from me haa
