It's gonna be a long long journey
It's gonna be an uphill climb
It's gonna be tough fight
It's gonna be some lonely nights
But I am ready to carry on
I am so glad the worst is over ('cause almost took me out)
I can start living now
I feel like I can do anything
And finally I am not afraid to breath

Anything you say to me
And everything you do
You can't deny the truth
'Cause I am the living proof
So many don't survive
They just don't make it through
But look at me
I am the living proof
Oh yes I am

Thinking about life's been painful
Yes it was
Took a lot to learn how to smile
So now I am gonna talk to my people,
About the storm, about the storm
Oh so glad the worst is over
I can start flying now
My best days are right in front of me
Yeah and I am almost there
'Cause now I am free

Anything you say to me
And everything you do
You can't deny the truth
'Cause I'm the living proof
So many don't survive
They just don't make it through
But look at me
I am the living proof

I know where I am going
Hey 'cause I know where I've been
I am gonna feel strong that's showing
I am gonna keep going
That's the way that I will

Anything you say to me
And everything you do
You can't deny the truth
'Cause I'm the living proof
So many those who fight
They just don't make it through
But look at me hey yeah
I am the living proof

Nothing about my life has been easy
But nothing's gonna keep me down
'Cause I know a lot more today
Than I knew yesterday
So I am ready to carry on
Oh Lordie
