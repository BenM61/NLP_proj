Not too precious about the things I've done
Or the times that I've gone and wasted
I'm not concerned about the bitch I've been
They sure must've all deserved it

It's so cool
It's the groove

I've been savaged by the vicious ones
Every boy in his low-life corner

Electro-soul
It's only rock 'n' roll

And when it gets down to it
I lose myself, but can't let go
And when it comes down to it
I dare not lose my self control

I thought I was strong enough to handle it
I got rid of that chip on my shoulder
I never thought that I'd be tough enough
Ain't that what your mama told ya?

And I coo, over you
Call me stupid and misunderstood
I've every right to my own persona
I slip and slide to the other side

And when it gets down to it
I lose myself, but can't let go
And when it comes down to it
I dare not lose my self control

I'm not too precious about the things I've done
Or the times that I've gone and wasted
I'm not concerned about the bitch I've been
They sure must've all deserved it

Not too precious about the things I've done
Or the times that I've gone and wasted
