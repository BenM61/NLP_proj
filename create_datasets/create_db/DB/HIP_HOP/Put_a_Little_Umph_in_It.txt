I love it when you wind on me
When you put it right on me
All the faces that you make
All the sounds you create
When you put a little
When you put a little bit of umph in it
That's when I lose control
When you put a little umph in it
Start squeezin' and you won't let go
When you put a little umph in it
Keep tellin' me how much you love me
When you put a little umph in it
When you put a little bit of umph in it, ooh

[Brandon]
She's so scandalous
But I love everything she do the best (yeah, yeah)
Ain't no competition, so down wit it
And so submissive
I'm in all, all of you, you're my mission
Got my mind in a trance and my body sure to follow
Ooo, keep doin' that thing you do
Go head and ride

[Chorus]
I love it when you wind on me
When you put it right on me
All the faces that you make
All the sounds you create
When you put a little
When you put a little bit of umph in it
That's when I lose control
When you put a little umph in it
Start squeezin' and you won't let go
When you put a little umph in it
Keep tellin' me how much you love me
When you put a little umph in it
When you put a little bit of umph in it, ooh

[Brian]
I love it when you strip for me
Ain't lookin' for a tip
Plus I love the way you just shake ya lil hips for me
And the way you lick ya lips
And do them little thangs to get me off
All I wanna do is get you off
Say you wanna be my girlfriend
Baby you done paid the cost
Ooo, Ooo (Ooo) that's all you gonna hear when the lights go off
Lovin' how you do it
And I don't think there's another girl in the world for me

[Chorus]
I love it when you wind on me
When you put it right on me
All the faces that you make
All the sounds you create
When you put a little
When you put a little bit of umph in it
That's when I lose control
When you put a little umph in it
Start squeezin' and you won't let go
When you put a little umph in it
Keep tellin' me how much you love me
When you put a little umph in it
When you put a little bit of umph in it, ooh

[Ashanti]
Hey boy, you're the only one that I want
You're the only one that I
Wanna give it to in every way
I wanna please ya, not tease ya
Like this, you say you like when I squeeze a lil bit
Well, you ain't felt nothin' yet (nothin' yet)
I hear this beat in my head
Watch me move my hips to it

Left to right, right to left
I'ma have ya outta breath
When I put a little umph in it
When I put a little umph in it, ooh
Back and forth, all my love
You gon' want some more
When I put a little umph in it
When I put a little umph in it, ooh

[Chorus]
I love it when you wind on me
When you put it right on me
All the faces that you make
All the sounds you create
When you put a little
When you put a little bit of umph in it
That's when I lose control
When you put a little umph in it
Start squeezin' and you won't let go
When you put a little umph in it
Keep tellin' me how much you love me
When you put a little umph in it
When you put a little bit of umph in it, ooh
