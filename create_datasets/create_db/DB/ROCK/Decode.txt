How can I decide what's right
When you're clouding up my mind?
I can't win your losing fight
All the time

Not gonna ever own what's mine
When you're always taking sides
But you won't take away my pride
No, not this time
Not this time

How did we get here?
When I used to know you so well
How did we get here?
Well, I think I know how

The truth is hiding in your eyes
And it's hanging on your tongue
Just boiling in my blood
But you think that I can't see
What kind of man that you are
If you're a man at all
Well, I will figure this one out
On my own
(I'm screaming, "I love you so")
On my own
(My thoughts you can't decode)

How did we get here?
When I used to know you so well, yeah
How did we get here?
Well, I think I know how

Do you see what we've done?
We've gone and made such fools
Of ourselves
Do you see what we've done?
We've gone and made such fools
Of ourselves

How did we get here?
When I used to know you so well, yeah, yeah
Well, how did we get here?
When I used to know you so well.
I think I know
I think I know

There is something I see in you
It might kill me
But I want it to be true
