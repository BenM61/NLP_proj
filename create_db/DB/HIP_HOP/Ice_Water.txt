Yo, yo
Take out the rap kingpin, the black Jesus
I know a few niggaz sniff coke, it cause seizures
Peace to half-moon Caesars
And all the bitches in the bleachers
Hot weather, sex on the beaches
Jury shopping out of the country
Deluxe luxury, people saying them not change
Look, truckle me
But what about the Wonder Woman bracelet
Two-oh point three diamond cut engraved rubies
Kid I laced it
My sweet tooth gotta nigga throbbin, ready for robbin
But first hit Maria's, for a butter almond
The bionic microphone is stacked mechanic
Move like a bunch of Mexicans with bandanas
Son, it's on so we can just Maxamillion
I got the spot sewn, so we can make a billion
The God's tropical
Ladies call me black fruit punch
Rainbow, flavored niggas murder niggas for lunch
Peace to the Paris crew in the avenue, and my nigga Jay Love
Who carries switch blades on the red roof

Yo, the first branch, the third leaf, whoever want it got beef
I politic, show love, crush those who dare creep
Into my realm of sunshine I praise divine
Fine line between dawn of dumb, deaf and blind
He ain't mine, he shook like the faggots on daytime
Crossed over grain while we was bubblin moonshine
Sippin on the Moet, laid up, Rae-Gambino
Mastermind the plan, Tony Starks, Cappachino
Develop while your head be swellin up all for the nation
Blinded by the ice while I release the confrontation
Donna holy fat bads of weed, ravioli
Pasta, Bodyguard the killa bee songs like Kevin Costner
Infrared all inside your bumba rasta
Cappadonna pimped the derby like the mobster

Yeah, yeah
Eight spaghetti lame brain ass niggaz
Quarters, nickels, and dimes bitch
Except for overtime nigga
Any ass money should be fine
Cause I'm coming strong, reaking niggas backs
Keepin shit real
If you haven't noticed this crazy ass rusty, ass nigga
Let me tell you this four times
Tony Starks, Raekwon the chef
Cappachino and Golden Arms
Is comin through mad strong
From the isles of Shaolin
For all them faggot ass
Rusty ticket-head bitches too
Shump shump baby

Yo back in the days, baggin crack, scrapin plates
Flippin cakes to them heavy head niggaz hatin Jakes
It be us, all the war's soldiers, hangin in halls gettin over
City niggaz who for blood money rockin Rovers
Stay dipped, don't have no money in your pocket
In the streets while these people mark money in their Jeep
Crack bums watch your back for jumps
Caught before a fake twenty dollar bill
Get em son, we ain't the one
Politickin, purse vickin, sick of these Dominicans
Eatin good, had to shoot my way up out of Bennigans
That's life, to top it all off, beef for white
Pullin bleach out tryin to throw it in my eyesight
Yo what the f*ck was on yo mind?
