[Chorus: 1]
My heart my head my mind my soul
My feelings over you

My tears my touch remember all that I am to you

[Chorus: 2]
My heart my mind my soul
My feelings over you

My tears my touch remember all that I am

When you're gonna pick up the phone and call me
Tell me I can come over

I got my ticket and my bags are packed
My coat is hangin' over my shoulder
Time is passing and it's getting late
This heart of mine just can't wait
And after all that we've been through
I maybe get there and I'll give it to you baby

[Chorus: 1]

My tears my touch remember all that I am to you

[Chorus: 2]

My tears my touch remember all that I am

Standing by the window and lookin' out
My heart is turning I want to shout

You're complicated I don't want to complain
The way you're acting can you explain

Why all this love is wasted on you
Can I live with all that is you

You say you love me silence I can't hear
All I want is to be near you baby

[Chorus: 1]

My tears my touch remember all that I am to you

[Chorus: 2]

My tears my touch remember all that I am

I'm looking for a reason to stay true

Looking for our love
Looking at me and looking at you

And even if I could turn away and then
I see that I'm falling in love again

Some times I wanna give you up
Some times I want to leave you alone
Some times I want to run away
And some times I want you to come back home
Come home to me yeah yeah baby
I know I know you'll be remember me
Come home come home
Yeah baby
I'm right here baby
Come home to me
Yes I'm right here baby

Yeah all I am to you
I know you feel me baby
Yeah yeah
Come on come on
Home to me
