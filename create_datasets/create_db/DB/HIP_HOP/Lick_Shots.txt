[Missy] 
Ugh, Ay yo Timberland, see what they don't understand 
Is we about to flip our whole style on ?em for two double zero one (Ay!) 
And for those of you who hated (Ay!) 
You only made us more creative 

[Timberland] 
Misdemeanor Ugh! 

[Missy] 
You don't want to speak my name 
Mess around get that ass blown away 
Blaaah! 
Fool gone away 
I didn't even like your tail anyway 
Missy got somethin' to say 
I ride down the block in an escalade 
Bling bling all in your face 
I think you might need to put on your shades 
Blaaah! 
I know you feel me tho 
You hatin' on me, but you hear me tho 
Twenty inch rims sittin' crazy low 
AAAAHHHHHHH! I'm a crazy ho 
I'm a keep the party live 
Me and Timbaland gonna flip it tonight 
Keep yo hands in the sky 
Wave ?em round like your crazy high 

[Chorus] 
Hugh! 
Time to lick shots 
Time to see you dance 
Hey you, why you frontin' 
Blaaah! 
Time to lick shots 
Time to see you dance 
Hey you, why you frontin' 
Blaaah! 

[Missy] 
You don't know who I be 
You mammy tell you not to f*ck wit me 
If I give you head, you'll never leave 
Raaah! 
Stop sweatin' me 
Flip it on the black hand side 
Look it here boy, don't you even try it 
Make me dislocate your spine 
My rings put your shine like turpentine 
What you comin' around hang out fo? 
Baby him know, you just want my dough 
Get cha black ass on the flo 
Fool touch me, that's a no no 
Raaah! 
Mr. DJ won't you play that song 
Tell the freaks shake they nasty thongs 
Hey boys won't you sing along 
'Cause we gone rock the party til' the early morn 

[Chorus] 

Why'all don't hear me (hot) 
You got your guns but you don't scare me (ooooooh) 
Originality is leary (ugh) 
My only style and I ain't sharin' (back up, back up?easy now) 
Hey why'all (hot) 
Let's turn it up and tear the club down (ugh) 
Grab your drinks and give me two rounds (zooooo) 
I'll break you off I'm goin' down down 
Watch yourself, I'm about to turn it up 

[Chorus] 

[Music plays a little] 

[Chorus] 

[Music fades until end]
