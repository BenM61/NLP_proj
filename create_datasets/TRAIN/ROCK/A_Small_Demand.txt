I've got a problem
How to spend my time
So obligated to nothing for so long
Nothing's really on my mind

Gotta make the connections
Force of habit or habit enforced, yea
When I get, you'll know I get it
I'll know just what I want

All we ever wanted was just everything
All we ever needed was just everyone
This is a small demand, it's a small demand
This is a small demand, it's a small demand

All we ever wanted was just everything
All we ever needed was just everyone
This is a small demand, it's a small demand
This is a small demand, it's a small demand
Hey baby I can't believe
That we are grateful for the shit we receive

I've got a problem
A matter of erection
A question of needing the real things
Or just a reality of me

I lose control of motion
Which hunger are you trying to feed?
'Cause baby, what you want
Isn't always what you need

All we ever wanted was just everything
All we ever needed was just everyone
This is a small demand, it's a small demand
This is a small demand, it's a small demand

All we ever wanted was just everything
All we ever needed was just everyone
This is a small demand, it's a small demand
This is a small demand, it's a small demand
Yea baby I can't believe
That we're grateful for the shit we recieve

All we ever wanted was just everything
All we ever needed was just everyone
This is a small demand, it's a small demand
This is a small demand, it's a small demand

All we ever wanted was just everything
All we ever needed was just everyone
This is a small demand, it's a small demand
This is a small demand, it's a small demand
Yeah baby I can't believe
That we are grateful for the shit we receive
