From the day that I saw you
I knew that we would pursue
'Cause the chemistry we felt that day
Felt so real and so true
Looking back on a year we spent together
How it's been,
What we went through
Although we've had our
Little ups and downs
We've still pulled through

Baby girl you're my world
My everything
I want to lace you with diamonds and every ring
Give you everything you dream and fantasize
'Cause you can tell me
That you love me looking in my eyes
You keep it real with me
I keep it real with you
You keep on loving me
I'll keep on loving you
Keep doing what you do
I feel your whole aura
And I can't wait to hook up
Again tomorrow baby
What

My love for won't ever end
You'll always be apart of me
As long as time keeps on passing by
You'll be my baby boy

Every time I look at you
I can't believe
I've found a love so true and
I took time to put
My trust in you
I must admit it was so hard to do
And every minute that I spend with you
You make me believe
I have nothing to loose and
Deep down I always knew
That you would be mine

Do you believe in destiny?
Because I got a funny feeling
This was meant to be
Without you I'd be lost,
I need you next to me
Preferably in a house full
Of luxuries and little kids
From day one I was sprung,
Knew you was gonna be the one
'Cause my heart spoke for the
Very first time in a long while
And every time you smile, I can see
Us walking up the aisle with you
Carrying my child
C'mon

My love for you won't ever end
You'll always be apart of me
As long as time keeps on passing by
You'll be my baby boy

If you were to go, I don't know
You're the only one who
Sweeps me off my feet
Makes my soul go week
The only one who makes
My heart want to beat and I,
I could never live without you
You know that what I feel
Has to be true
'Cause you're my, my sweet love

Ever since the first time,
That I looked into your eyes
I knew that you were
Gonna be mine
Feeling you from the inside
When you're not by my side
You're the only girl
That's on my mind
I never knew a love like this,
A long so strong
A vision so picture perfect
It could never be wrong
Along the way, you're gonna
See you belong wit Jay
I might have to marry you one day baby eh

My love for you won't ever end
You'll always be apart of me
As long as time keeps on passing by
You'll be my baby boy

My love for you won't ever end
You'll always be apart of me
As long as time keeps on passing by
You'll be my baby boy
