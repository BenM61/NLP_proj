Ever since I was a little girl 
Ever since I took my first step and said my first hello 
I've been dancing I've been singing 
I've been hoping I've been dreaming 
I've been praying for a chance to show 
Show the world 
I can be 
Just like the stars on TV 
Here I am, here I am, here I am 
Now isn't it crazy, crazy, isn't it wild 
Here I am, here I am, here I am 
Now isn't it crazy, crazy 
Crazy, but here I am 
Like a little voice inside my heart 
Talkin' from the very start 
Tellin' me which way to go 
Always try, don't give up 
If you want it, never stop 
Take your time if you want to show 
Show the world 
You can be 
Just like the stars on TV 
Here I am, here I am, here I am 
Now isn't it crazy, crazy, isn't it wild 
Here I am, here I am, here I am 
Now isn't it crazy, crazy 
Crazy, but here I am 
Through the fire 
Through the rain 
Isn't it a little insane 
Here I am
