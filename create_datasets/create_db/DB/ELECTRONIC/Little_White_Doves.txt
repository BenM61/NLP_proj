I remember what it's like
To be a victim almost every night.
And no one knows, or really cares
What your drinking, or the clothes we wear.

Hello, hello
To the pirate stations
Hello, hello
To the ivy nations
Hello, hello
To all the generation

Yeah,
We come like little white doves, little white doves.
Little white doves, little white doves, baby.
Little white doves, little white doves. yeah.
