I'm so tired of being alone
These penitent walls are all I've known
Songbird calling across the water
Inside my silent asylum

Oh don't leave me on my own
Left me standing all alone
Cut me down to size so I can fit inside
Lies that will divide us both in time

See the turncoat on his knees
A vagabond that no one sees
When a moon is throwing shadows
You can't save the ones you've caught in battle

Oh don't leave me on my own
Left me standing all alone
Cut me down to size so I can fit inside
Lies you try to hide behind your eyes

Don't leave me on my own
Don't leave me on my own
So cut me down to size so I can fit inside
Lies that will divide us both in time
