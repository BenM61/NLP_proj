Cats down under the stars
Cats down under the stars

Cats on the blacktop, birdies in the treetop
Someone plays guitar that sounds like a clarinet
I ain't ready yet, to go to bed
Think I'll take a walk downtown instead

Cats down under the stars
Cats down under the stars

Cats in the limelight, feels like it's all right
Everybody wants something they might not get
I ain't ready yet, to go to bed
Think I'll take a walk downtown instead

Cats down under the stars
Cats down under the stars

Cats on the bandstand, give 'em each a big hand
Anyone who sweats like that must be all right
No one wants sometimes, no black eye
Just another cat beneath the stars tonight

Cats down under the stars
Cats down under the stars

Satin blouse unbuttoning
Satin blouse unbuttoning
Time's is doing it just for you
Time's a stripper, doing it just for you

Just for you
Just for you
Just for you
Just for you

Hammering the brass tacks, cover up you tracks, Jack
Ain't nowhere till you can pay your own way back
What else do you lack to make it right
Cats down under the stars tonight?

Cats down under the stars
Cats down under the stars

Cats down under the stars
Cats down under the stars
