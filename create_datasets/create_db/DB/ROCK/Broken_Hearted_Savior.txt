Fields are white in snowy spring, 
And I can't remember the last time that I've seen her,
The highway is still cold and wet, 
And I can't forget the way I had to leave her,
And every passing day, she flickers and she fades.
Is someone to help her when she falls from the heavens?

[Chorus]
And I'll love her yet, though she has done me wrong.
And I'll bring her back, though she has been long gone.
And I'll always be her
Broken hearted savior

And every heavy night takes out the little life that's left within her.
Every man she gives her love, he takes it, and leaves her with a dinner.
Our love was once a flame, now I'm just a forgotten name,
Am I the only one to blame for having loved her?

[Chorus]
