It's the glare from the reflection
Making patterns in your eye
It's the looking back in anger
For every second slipping by
Undertow has come to take me
Guarded by the blazing sun
Look at everything around us, well
Look at everything we've done

Please, anyone?
I don't think I can
Save myself
I'm drowning here, please
Anyone?
I don't think I can
Save myself
I'm drowning here, please
Anyone?
I don't think I can
Save myself
I'm drowning here please,
Anyone?
I don't think I can
Save myself

There's a tiny little window
Swarms of locusts fill the sky
Maybe I'd just disappear
If I can't keep my head above the tide

Please, anyone?
I don't think I can
Save myself
I'm drowning here, please
Anyone?
I don't think I can
Save myself
I'm drowning here, please
Anyone?
I don't think I can
Save myself
I'm drowning here please,
Anyone?
I don't think I can
Save myself
