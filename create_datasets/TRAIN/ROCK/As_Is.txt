You can't hide 
Behind social graces 
So don't try 
To be all touchy feely 
'Cause you lie 
In my face of all places 
But I got no 
Problem with that really 
What bugs me 
Is that you believe what you're saying 
What bothers me 
Is that you don't know how you feel 
What scares me 
Is that while you're telling me stories 
You actually 
Believe that they are real 

And I got no illusions about you 

Guess what 
I never did 
When I said 
When I said I'll take it 
I mean 
I mean as is 
As is, as is, as is, as is
As is, as is, as is

Just give up 
And admit you're an asshole 
You would be in some good company
And I think you'd find 
That your friends would forgive you 
Or maybe I 
Am just speaking for me 

'Cause when I look around 
I think this, this is good enough 
And I try to laugh 
At whatever life brings 
'Cause when I look down 
I just miss all the good stuff 
And when I look up 
I just trip over things 
And I got no illusions about you 

Guess what 
I never did 
When I say 
When I say I'll take it 
I mean 
I mean as is
As is, as is, as is
As is, as is, as is
As is, as is, as is
As is, as is
