(Ja Rule)
Yeah, yeah, heh

(Ja Rule)
Come on why'all, tonight somebody sho nuff
Gon' tear the club the f*ck up as soon as I hit the scene
All eyes on us, mean, and so vicious
A good nigga, bad intentions
Not to mention, them 12 engine benzes with fish lenses
We park right out front
To handle our business
The broads on the way in
Showin a little attention
Like, I fucked before but ain't never call
That's life you either love to live it
Or just live it, I live it to the limit
Champaigne finish gangsta
Image, platinum shades swingin
Then I do that 2 step that niggaz do
We don't really dance
We just rub the dick on the ass
And fill the glass with nothin but ??
And if they pop it gettin the poppin with me
Get my niggaz tonight baby, lets partaay!

Lets all get high, get out, feel free tonight
Temptations, is tempting
To have the time of your life
Lets all get high, get out, feel free tonight
Temptations, is tempting
To have the time of your life
(Charli Baltimore)
Yo, uh
Now a party ain't a party till chuck come through
Bring who? Rolled dolo jeans over Manolo's
Duke says I look better out the photos
And hotter in person, hottest when I'm cursin
Love my bitch thuggelbees
Strokin my ego, then he go
For the bubbly, nigga love me
We go to the vehicle, talk dirty
Past flirty, flight leavin at 5:30
It's hot in herre, foggin the windows
...
Throw dat, I the designated driver
Chuck never the rider, gotta play
Passenger side beside them, whoa
Gotta be controllin when I'm rollin
Weed niggaz swollen, cock blocker
Hands on my knockers, he feelin them poppers
But Chuck never givin it up, livin it up

Lets all get high, get out, feel free tonight
Temptations, is tempting
To have the time of your life
Lets all get high, get out, feel free tonight
Temptations, is tempting
To have the time of your life
(Charli Baltimore)
Uh, Count me and My niggaz as OD'in

Off to the murder mansion, ride the shoulder
Benz and the Rover, Nigga we ain't sober
Girl Interrupted, murder got me corrupted
With shots so that any lickin shots with the semi
Out the sunroof of the Bentley
Bottles all empty but niggaz got stashes
Never fuckin the glasses

(Ja Rule)
Ha, You know the Rule roll up in the party
Me and Charli, Ready to have them hotties
Rub up on my body, 'cause after the club

In the Red Corvette, swervin lanes
