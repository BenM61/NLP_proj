Some say we walk alone
Barefoot on wicked stone, no light
And sanctuary found never waits around awhile

Marching to the sea
Their dreams stay in the shadows
Their dreams stay firmly rooted in the shallows
See the scraping sky
See my destination there tonight

So say I walk alone, barefoot
On wicked stone tonight
Will you leap to follow
Will you turn and go
Will your dreams stay rooted in the shallows

See the scraping sky
Far beyond the shallows
Far beyond the reaches of the shadows

Though youth may fade with boyhood's cares
New fear will catch us unawares
I know it will

So you might say
The path we share is one of danger
And of fear
Until the end
