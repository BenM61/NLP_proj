Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this, mama said
(Mama said, mama said)
Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this, my mama said
(Mama said, mama said)

I went walking the other day and
Everything was going fine
Met a little boy named Billy Joe
And then I almost lost my mind

Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this, my mama said
(Mama said, mama said)
Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this, my mama said

And then she said someone would look at me
Like I'm looking at you someday
Then I might find
I don't want you any old way but I don't worry 'causre

Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this, my mama said
(Mama said, mama said)
Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this, my mama said

My eyes are wide open
But all that I can see is
Chapel bells a-tollin'
For everyone but-a me but I don't worry 'cause

Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this, my mama said
(Mama said, mama said)
Mama said there'll be days like this
There'll be days like this, my mama said

(Mama said, mama said, hey, hey) don't you worry
(Mama said, mama said, hey, hey) don't you worry, now
(Mama said, mama said, hey, hey)
(Mama said, mama said, hey, hey) mama said there'll be days like this
(Mama said, mama said, hey, hey) there'll be days like this, my mama said
(Mama said, mama said, hey, hey) mama said there'll be days like this
(Mama said, mama said, hey, hey) there'll be days like this, my mama said
(Mama said, mama said, hey, hey) don't you worry
