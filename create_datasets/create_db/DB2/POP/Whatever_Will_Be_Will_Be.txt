When I was just a little girl
I asked my mother, "What will I be?
Will I be pretty?
Will I be rich?"
Here's what she said to me

"Que sera, sera
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours to see
Que sera, sera
What will be, will be"

When I was just a child in school
I asked my teacher, "What will I try?
Should I paint pictures"
Should I sing songs?"
This was her wise reply

"Que sera, sera
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours to see
Que sera, sera
What will be, will be"

When I grew up and fell in love
I asked my sweetheart, "What lies ahead?
Will we have rainbows
Day after day?"
Here's what my sweetheart said

"Que sera, sera
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours to see
Que sera, sera
What will be, will be"

Now I have Children of my own
They ask their mother, "What will I be?"
Will I be handsome?
Will I be rich?"
I tell them tenderly

"Que sera, sera
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours to see
Que sera, sera
What will be, will be
Que Sera, Sera!"
