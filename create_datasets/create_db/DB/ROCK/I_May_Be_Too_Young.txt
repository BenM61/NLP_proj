Wow! Hey!
You heard about Suzi from Baton Rouge?
You have? Well
let me tell you about her!
Yeh ! Well little Suzi was raised at the Baton Rouge
Suzi was fooled
she was born to lose
She could be seen keeping company wherever she went
With those long haired blue eyed southern gents.

She said I may be too young to fall in love
But I'm still hangin' round
She said I may be too young to fall in love
But I'm still hangin' round.
Just waiting for you
I'm just awaitin' for you
She said I'm waitin' for you
you
I'm just waitin' for you.

Well
you know what those Louisiana nights can do
To a back street girl with southern blues
Fifteen have passed and straight out of school
She was hard to handle
she was easy to fool
They said go go go little Suzi
Too old to scold and too young to choose
Suzi was fooled
born to lose
And that's how they talk about her down in Baton Rouge.

She said I may be too young to fall in love .
