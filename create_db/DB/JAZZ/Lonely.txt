They're tellin' me,
The does and don'ts
But nobody's askin' me
What I desire
(I want to be lonely)
No record company callin in today
No stress,no drama, end of delay,
Chorus:
I want to be lonely,
Baby I want to be lonely,
I just wana be by myself,
I wana be lonely
Baby I wana be lonely
Final by myself
No mobile rings,
No traffic jams
No date,no stress 
And no one that wants my money
Just for nothing
