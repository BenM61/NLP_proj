Freezing Fridays fleeing from me
I've seen you around, I don't know what you think of me
The colors in the air never scared you like they should
I saw it in your face so I told you and you understood

I wanna be your friend
I wanna ask your advice on a weekday
I wanna plan something nice for the weekend
I wanna be your friend
ooh, wanna ask your advice on a weekday
I wanna plan something nice for the weekend

Sustained means some Sunday so are we
People speak all week, I just forgot what they told me
The stories in your hair that you carry are it for me
I'd be lying if I said that I didn't want to lay in it

I wanna be your friend
I wanna ask your advice on a weekday
I wanna plan something nice for the weekend
I wanna be your friend
ooh, wanna ask your advice on a weekday
I wanna plan something nice for the weekend

The stories in your hair I've been carrying all around
I'd be lying if I said that I didn't wanna hear 'em now
The stories in your hair I've been carrying all around
Well I'd be lying if I said that I didn't wanna tear it out

I wanna be your friend
I wanna ask your advice on a weekday
I wanna plan something nice for the weekend
I wanna be your friend
ooh, wanna stay at your side on a weekday
I wanna see inside your eyes on a weekend
