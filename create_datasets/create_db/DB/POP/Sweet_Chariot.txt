The rider rides with a clickety-click
And the timer stops for a second or two
You got your hands in your pockets, and you're lookin' ahead
You got no time, you draw the fine line 

But look, see the juggler throws his sticks in the air
He don't care
He's got them angels from below, they'll keep his time
Ever true 
Time isn't after you

You can't hold on to it or keep pushing away
Just sitting around in your wishing well
Paint a wish for you, paint a wish for me just the same 
The poet throws her words in the air

She don't care
She's got them angels from below, they'll keep her words
Ever true 
Speak to me in the way that you do
And I could be taken back to the days of that old jacket

Push me in your way, and you hold me down
You hold me, hold me, hold me
I kinda like that 
The lightning pushes on through the air
We don't care
We've got those angels from below, they'll keep our time
Ever true 

Time's tickin' away
You got no time
You draw that fine line
Between you and me
