Yellow bird, yellow bird, up high in banana tree.
Yellow bird, you sit all alone like me.

Did your lady friend leave your nest again?
That is very sad, makes me feel so bad.
You can fly away, in the sky away.
You're more lucky than me.

I also had a pretty girl, she's not with me today.
They're all the same, the pretty girls,
Take tenderness then they fly away.

Yellow bird up high in banana tree.
Yellow bird, you sit all alone like me.

Let her fly away, in the sky away.
Pick a town and soon, take from night to noon
Black and yellow, you, like banana too,
They might pick you some day

Wish that I was a yellow bird,
I'd fly away with you.
But I am not a yellow bird,
So here I sit, nothin' else to do.

Yellow bird.
Yellow bird.
Yellow bird.
