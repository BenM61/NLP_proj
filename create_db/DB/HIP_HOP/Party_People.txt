And all you New Edition rappers better cool it now
For I make a fool of yall,
Paper stacked as tall as Yao Ming
Look at the bling
Settings in rings
Lookin' like basketballs.

Just walked through the door

Well it's Fergie motherfucker
Comin' straight from California
Stuntin' in my loc locs.
Dreamin' bout me M.I.A.,
Boyfriend wonderin' where I'm at,
Cause I'm in the spot spot.
Why he always tryin' to be puttin' me down on lock lock?

Just walked through the door
What's it gonna be,
I can't get to the floor
Boys all over me.
What it?s gonna be
Where my party, pa' party party pa' party people at?
Where my party, pa' party party pa' party people at?
Just walked through the door

I can't get to the floor
Girls all over me.

Patiently waitin' and takin' my time
Watchin' these haters
Don't come with they rhymes
Watchin' these suckers are mimickin', gimmickin'
Then they start fallin' off one at a time.
You can go search but you never could find,
I promise you derrty I'm one of a kind.
Mold is broken, the formulas mine.
I killed the idea and destroyed the design.

I was patiently waitin' and takin' my time
Now that I'm here I'm gettin' my shine.
All of you haters can kiss a behind,
Specifically speakin' I'm talkin' bout mine.
Don't need you to tell me, I know that I'm fine.
I'm killin' it baby so call it a crime.
Yea you watch it I'm stealin' my time
I told you before that big girls don't cry.

Just walked through the door
What's it gonna be,
I can't get to the floor
Boys all over me.
What it?s gonna be
Where my party, pa' party party pa' party people at?
Where my party, pa' party party pa' party people at?
Just walked through the door
What's it gonna be,
I can't get to the floor
Girls all over me.
Where my party, pa? party party pa' party people at?
Where my party, pa? party party pa' party people at?

Where my party people at [Repeated]
