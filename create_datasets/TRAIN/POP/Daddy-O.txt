Daddy-o (daddy-o), sure good lookin'
Daddy-o (daddy-o), always cookin'
Daddy-o (daddy-o), ready to go
All the girls are batty
Over Daddy-o

You couldn't call him handsome
But he's loaded with style
Always wears a T-shirt
And a great big smile
Something 'bout this crazy kid
We all love so
When he's around
The girls all holler Daddy-o

Daddy-o (daddy-o)sure good lookin'
Daddy-o (daddy-o)always cookin'
Daddy-o (daddy-o)ready to go
All the girls are batty
Over Daddy-o

Got a big convertible
Fire engine red
Howlin' and a prowlin'
As it goes to bed
He's really Mr Big
To all the kids in school
Everybody knows
Daddy-o's real cool

Daddy-o (daddy-o), sure good lookin'
Daddy-o (daddy-o), always cookin'
Daddy-o (daddy-o), ready to go
All the girls are batty
Over Daddy-o

You never have to see him
To know that he's around
He's got a set of horns
With the craziest sound
The girls start in jivin'
When they hear him blow
They all jump and holler
Here's Daddy-o

Daddy-o (daddy-o), sure good lookin'
Daddy-o (daddy-o), always cookin'
Daddy-o (daddy-o), ready to go
All the girls are batty
Over Daddy-o

All the girls are batty
Over Daddy-o
