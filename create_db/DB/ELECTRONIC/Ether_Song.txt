In the ether, in the ether's air
Would you be there? would you be my friend?
In the morning, in the morning rain
In the binary of a data stream

On an airplane, on a radio
All around me in the ether's flow

Under an orange sun
Running from what I've become
What am I running from?

You can't take a photograph of it at night
It lives in the code of a firefly buzzing
It vibrates through brickwalls, keeping their time
It cuddles the creeping chaos coming

I see it more clearly than ever before
I'm in its invisible river flowing
Through everything I've ever been through before
Heads up, something's really happening
