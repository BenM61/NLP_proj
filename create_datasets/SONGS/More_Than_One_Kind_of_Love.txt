There's a lot of things you should hold dear
Keep in your heart
Never let go
Never let go
Never let go
Pride and dignity
A sense of self
Hold on 

When that boy leaves
And you need someone to turn to
When you feel alone
You will know you're not alone
If you've been true
To all who are true to you
You'll make it
You'll make it fine

If you remember your friends
Just remember you can call
Just remember that passion fades
Good friendships seldom die
Go ahead have your fun
But don't turn your back on everyone
Though the body needs love
There is more than one kind 

More
More than one kind of love
There is more
More than one kind 

Yes he fills your heart
Fills your mind
He's all you want
All you need
Everything
Everything
Everything but

Love that's that exclusive
That obsessive
Can hurt 

When that love pales
And becomes human emotion
Where will you go
If you've neglected those you know
But if you stay true
To those who are true to you
You'll make it
You'll make it fine

If you remember your friends
Just remember you can call
Just remember that passion fades
Good friendships seldom die
Go ahead have your fun
But don't turn your back on everyone
Though the body needs love
There is more than one kind

More
More than one kind of love
There is more
More than one kind
