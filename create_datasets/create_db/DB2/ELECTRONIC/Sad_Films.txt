Looking up it's a silver screen
And I don't know what it is I've seen
I only know that it made me cry

Some connection from another time
I lost control and I lost my mind
I only know that it turned me round

But it's alright now
It's alright now
It's just a sad film
A sad film
A sad film crossed my mind

I saw the names and the faces change
Like moving targets out of range
I only know that it changed my mind

Then other forces were stepping in
Reminding me of way back when
I only know that it changed my mind

But it's alright now
It's alright now
It's just a sad film
A sad film
A sad film crossed my mind

But it's alright now
It's alright now
It's just a sad film
A sad film
A sad film crossed my mind
