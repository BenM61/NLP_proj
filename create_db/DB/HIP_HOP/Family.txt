[Chorus:]
We are family
I got all my sisters with me
We are family
Get up ev'rybody and sing

Ev'ryone can see we're together
As we walk on by
(Fly!) and we fly just like birds of a feather
I won't tell no lie
(All!) all of the people around us they say
Can they be that close
Just let me state for the record
We're giving love in a family dose

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

Living life is fun and we've just begun
To get our share of the world's delights
(High!) high hopes we have for the future
And our goal's in sight
(We!) no we don't get depressed
Here's what we call our golden rule
Have faith in you and the things you do
You won't go wrong
This is our family jewel

(Repeat Chorus To Fade)
