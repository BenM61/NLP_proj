Needles in my heart, spell on my mind
Your powerful potion gets me every time
I toss and turn, I can't sleep at night
Your kiss burns through my dreams
Here it comes again
I don't stand a chance
Soul possession
Got me in a trance
Pullin' me back to you
Deja voodoo
Fire in the dark, pounding in my brain
Driven by the chant calling out my name
I toss and turn, I can't sleep
Your kiss burns, through my dreams
