A god decaying
A starving faith
My world has fallen
Let's start a war
Miseducation
A sacrifice
A modulation
Of all our hate

Machines are praying
We are the bait
A dark upon us
We'll start to fall
A presentation
We fight with pride
Humiliation

From my cold dead hands

Do what I wanna do
Say what I wanna say
They wanna take it away
From my cold dead hands
The price of being free
And what it means to me
They wanna take it away

From my cold dead hands

Do what I wanna do
Say what I wanna say
They wanna take it away
From my cold dead hands
The price of being free
And what it means to me
They wanna take it away

They try to hold us
Held by our necks
The air is changing
Breathe poison gas
An absolution
We'll get there fast
They will enslave us
My mind is free
A new world order
Where we'll be slaves
Under a system
Control our lives
Where we'll be punished?
For how we live
Elimination
Free will is killed

From my cold dead hands

Do what I wanna do
Say what I wanna say
They wanna take it away
From my cold dead hands
The price of being free
And what it means to me
They wanna take it away

Fallen nations got away
Lives are changing
We're the prey
Time is changing
We're at war
What we're breathing
Fighting for

Do what I wanna do
Say what I wanna say
They wanna take it away
From my cold dead hands
The price of being free
And what it means to me
They wanna take it away

Do what I wanna do
Say what I wanna say
They wanna take it away
From my cold dead hands
The price of being free
And what it means to me
They wanna take it away

Do what I wanna do
Say what I wanna say
They wanna take it away
From my cold dead hands
The price of being free
And what it means to me
They wanna take it away

Do what I wanna do
Say what I wanna say
They wanna take it away
From my cold dead hands
The price of being free
And what it means to me
They wanna take it away
