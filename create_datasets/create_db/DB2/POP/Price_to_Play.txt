Fail to see how destructive we can be
Taking without giving back 'till the damage can be seen
Can you see? Can you see?

The more you take, the more you blame
But everything still feels the same
The more you hurt the more you scream
The price you pay to play the game
Then all you see and all you gave
And all you step on will know shame
There are no rules, no one to blame
The price to play the game

Empathy, the chosen way to be
Blindly look the other way
While you waste away with me
Can you see? Can you see?

The more you take, the more you blame
But everything still feels the same
The more you hurt the more you scream
The price you pay to play the game
Then all you see and all you gave
And all you step on will know shame
There are no rules, no one to blame
The price to play the game

What you pay to play the game
What you pay to play the game
What you pay to play the game
What you pay to play the game

The more you take, the more you blame
But everything still feels the same
The more you hurt the more you scream
The price you pay to play the game
Then all you see and all you gave
And all you step on will know shame
There are no rules, no one to blame
The price to play the game

What you pay to play the game
What you pay to play the game
What you pay to play the game
What you pay to play the game
