Been cravin' more life and more love
That lives in the soul of my heart
Don't wanna be no artist
I'm a dancin', singin' work of art

You lit my heart with fiery aggression and you showed me
The fury of love, sex and affection that ya owed me

(In danger)
But I ain't scared
(In danger)
I found the splendor there

(Dancin')
Atop a flamin' pit
(We're dancing)
We are creating it
(We're dancing)
Right on the lip of a volcano

Nature with its true voice cries out, undissembled, "Be as I am!"
Revealed in its wildest, most generous incarnation

(In danger)
Devil-may-care
(In danger)
The fire's everywhere

(We're dancing)
So let the fire lick
(We're dancing)
We are creating it
(We're dancing)
On the lip of a volcano
Let's dance!

In the center of action of my psyche's need for love
I want liberation and joy
In a paroxysm of intoxication, inspiration
Ain't no way to be coy

(In danger)
A blazing glare
(in danger)
I found the splendor there

(Dancing)
Won't letcha slip
(We're dancing)
Let the lava rip
(We're dancing)
On the lip of a volcano

(Dancing)
We are creating it
(We're dancing)
So let the fire rip
(We're dancing)
Right on the lip of a volcano
A volcano
A volcano

Thrown in the dance with the mystics
Burning me up with its music
Sensualistic
Ritualistic
Alchemistic
Polytheistic
