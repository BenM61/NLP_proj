In your eyes I see only one 
Find me the to place to run 
That's where I belong 
There we rise,your glory and mine 
Your pain is over now 
I make you shine, still believin' 

All the love in the world won't take me away from you 
My love is stronger, I am what you make me 
All the love in the world won't take you away from me 
In all my wonder I forever lay down here with you 

I find when love slips away 
Reach out for all you can 
Before it's too late 
There you fly, returning to me 
Out of your darkest nights I stand alone 
Still believin' 

All the love in the world won't take me away from you 
My love is stronger I forever lay down here with you 

My love is true 
All your darkest nights,I stand alone 
Still believin' 

All the love in the world won't take me away from you 
My love is stronger, I forever lay down here with you
