They call her Hot Sauce
She's hot and spicy
But twice as nicey
Although she burn me up
They call her Hot Sauce
She's hotter than pepper
I would have kept her
Although she burn me up.
 
What if fire didn't burn (burn!)
How would the lesson get learned? (learned!)
You sit there like a dope until you choke on all the smoke
(Smoke gets in your eyes)
Cover me in your sauce baby
Bury me in all that sauce
Smother me in your hot sauce, woman
Till smoke come from your thighs.
 
They call her Hot Sauce
She's hot and spicy
But twice as nicey
Although she burn me up
They call her Hot Sauce
She's hotter than pepper
I would have kept her
Although she burn me up.
 
The brother in the codpiece
I seen him on the TV
I think he likes his ladies
All sweet and sugary
Now I'm partial to a pudding
But that's for second course.
The main meal and the hors d'oeuvres
Must be smothered in hot sauce.
 
They call her Hot Sauce
She's hot and spicy
But twice as nicey
Although she burn me up
They call her Hot Sauce
She's hotter than pepper
I would have kept her
Although she burn me up.
 
What if steam didn't scald (scald!)
How would the story be told? (told!)
She sat and smoked a fag
While I was gagging on the shag
(Shag gets in your eyes)
Lemme get lost in your sauce baby
Cover me in your sauce
Lemme get lost in your hot sauce woman.
 
There was a fire truck attending
The smoke pouring from her nose
Her state of mind depending
On which way the wind blowed
Chili and Tabasco
Dripping on my shirt
I couldn't breathe, I couldn't see 
I had to call a smog alert.
