I don't know what's wrong with the youth of today 
Wandering lost, it's true what they say 
And who is to blame? tv and magazines 
They would have you believe that everyday is halloween 
Why, when I was a kid, playing in the ditches, 
Living in fear of satan and the witches 
The whole world was made of wood and smelled like gasoline 
The days were at least twice as long and the grass was green 

Running for my life, I was cursed by a talking snake 
I'd walk all day and throw rocks across a bottomless lake. 
There was a killer in the woods who would whistle. 
Once in a while I could hear him shoot his pistol. 
And the other kids hated me...but like a martyr, 
I drove myself harder and harder 
Blood in my eyes, scrubbing to get the dirt off 
I didn't say much, didn't like to take my shirt off 
I was quick but I didn't know the meaning of pain yet 
I would visit father bob and he would show me his train set, 
Tell me a story, offer me a glass of milk 
Send me on my way with a question to ask myself 
The rain didn't bother me the search had meaning 
Church was good but I'd rather be dreaming. 
High speed horseshoes, harnesses and heavy string 
The problem is, today they got an answer for everything. 
4-6-3 an x, an o 
And I can't think of a better way to end the day 
4-6-3 a punch, a kick 
And I can't think of a better way to end the day 
4-6-3 as yes, a no 
And I can't think of a better way to end the day 
4-6-3 it's life, death 
And I can't think of a better way to end the day 

Learning the words, turning the double play. 
Doing some damage in my own subtle way 
Been all over, I've seen too much 
I no longer feel the need to rush 
I'm upside down, I'm inside out 
Broken glass all in my mouth 
Cut wide open and everybody knew why 
'Cause when it comes to rocking something fierce, boy do I
