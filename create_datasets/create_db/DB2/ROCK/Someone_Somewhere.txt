Hello again, my sunshine in rain 
I hope you're well, I've missed you so, 
It's hard to tell 
Say goodnight, my blueberry light 
And dream of me, and while you dream 
I have to leave 

To someone, somewhere, I'll be coming back 
cause somewhere, someone, is waiting 

Here again, you never know when 
I want you near, at least a weekend every year 
Say goodbye, my blueberry pie 
I think you're oh, so beautiful, I have to go 

To someone, somewhere, I'll be coming back 
Cause somewhere, someone, is waiting
