Tell me because I've said it all
I've got a feeling we must've hit a wall here
And baby boy please, tell me like it is
'Cause you talk 'nuff but you never act on it

Because the drive it is alive and honey, it is calling you
And I'm numb, you're tryna hide it, I need more from you
So could you please respond to me because I'll never understand
I give you the keys and while you gladly take 'em you, don't use 'em

You tell me all the time baby
I'm the light in your life
And you love me more each day
You are starting to drive me crazy
Why won't you realise you gotta love me right baby

(Oh yeah) 
(All night come love me right)

Help me, I feel I've lost myself
It's just this one thing, we're great everywhere else
Or is it just me?
Am I not what you want?
'Cause if that's the case baby
Why lead me on?

Because the drive it is alive and honey, it is calling you
And I'm numb, you're tryna hide it baby, I need more from you
So could you please respond to me because I'll never understand
I give you the keys and while you gladly take 'em, you don't use 'em

(Why won't you?)
You tell me all the time baby
I'm the light in your life
And you love me more each day
You are starting to drive me crazy
Why won't you realize you gotta love me right baby

You tell me all the time baby (I need you here right next to me)
I'm the light in your life
And you love me more each day
You are starting to drive me crazy (come on get off your phone)
Why won't you realize you gotta love me right baby (I need to feel your body)

You tell me all the time baby
I'm the light in your life
And you love me more each day
You are starting to drive me crazy
Why won't you realize you gotta love me

Oh oh and I'm light in your life (come on now)
And you love me babe
Why won't you realize (you got to, you got to) you gotta love me right baby

(I want your love on me) you tell me all the time baby
I'm the light in your life
And you love me more each day
You are starting to drive me crazy
Why won't you realize you gotta love me right baby

You tell me all the time baby
I'm the light in your life
And you love me more each day
Starting to drive me crazy
Why won't you realize?

Love, love me, love me right
