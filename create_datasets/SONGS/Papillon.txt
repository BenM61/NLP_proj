Make our escape, you're my own Papillon
The world turns too fast
Feel love before it's gone

It kicks like a sleep twitch
My Papillon, feel love when it's shone
It kicks like a sleep twitch

Darling, just don't put down your guns yet
If there really was a God here
He'd have raised a hand by now

Now darling, you're born, get old, then die here
Well, that's quite enough for me
We'll find our own way home somehow

No sense of doubt or what you could achieve
I've found you out
I've seen the life you wish to leave

But when it kicks like a sleep twitch
You will choke, choke on the air you try to breathe
It kicks like a sleep twitch

Darling, now just don't put down your guns yet
If there really was a God here
He'd have raised a hand by now

Darling, you're born, get old, then die here
Well, that's quite enough for me, dear
We'll find our own way home somehow, how, how

It kicks like a sleep twitch
It kicks like a sleep twitch

Darling, just don't put down your guns yet
If there really was a God here
He'd have raised a hand by now

Darling, now you're born, get old, then die here
Well, that's quite enough for me, dear
We'll find our own way home somehow

It kicks like a sleep twitch
It kicks like a sleep twitch
