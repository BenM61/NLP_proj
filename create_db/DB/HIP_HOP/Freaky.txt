Girl drop
Get low like ya just heard the groove pop
P pop, butterfly, booty bounce, peculator, pony ride, old school flip, do the mash potatoes
I don't care just look freaky

Yo man in the club who's so sneaky
Yo voice like ?? so squeaky 
[unknown] You Shaniqwa, Shardinae
All why'all got stripper names baby we could play

But I got a clothin line
We specialize in lingerie
Walkin' like you on a runway scrounge
For this performance I took my braids out

Man I'm killin this track until it fades out
Shake da bottle den release the cork
And let it spray out, spray dese broads down
Wet t-shirt contest

500 dollars to the mommy wit the firmest breast
Yess

[Chorus: x 2]
Hachu I think I'm catchin the flu
'Cause you sick
Chicks get wet as soon as I spit
Freaky freaky freaky freaky freaky
Freaky freaky freaky freaky 
Hachu I think I'm catchin the flu
'Cause you sick
Chicks go crazy when dey see my whip
Freaky freaky freaky freaky freaky
Freaky freaky freaky freaky

If you too damn drunk den dis track will annoy you
Stop hatin on a true baller who'll employ you
All dese ladies want to take me home
Guaranteed I ain't leavin dis club alone

All dis ass in here think I ain't getting some
Sippin on coke and rum getting numb
Momma shake it like a salt shaka
You and yo ying yang twinz

I'm thug girl I ain't tuckin my chain in
Why you wearin a fur mothafucka it's rainin
You look like a fool for girls what chu gamin
You should think about goin home and changing

Cadillac escalade what I get brains in
Rollin my eyes to the back of my head like I'm trippin on heron
Got my head on sped on
She got a chest like vivica
Booty like that chick on outkast video
Here come the hook here we go

[Chorus: x 2]

Got 300 dems got a few broads just be runnin nems
Smellin like [unknown]
Not waitin in line just get pushed in yea we pushed in
Young Rome and Black got em gone offa Con and Yack

Pull up on got the crack oh!
Phat farm laced to the A-1
You kno a betta pimp
Naw it ain't one

You and you get back stage
You and you get the gas faze
You and you way passed age
You right there you be nasty

Want to creep wit me 
Want to freak wit me so frequently 
You kno how G's be
The young guerilla wit the icy scrilla
Ma don't you kno I'm the illest

[Chorus]

[Omari]

Damn she got a fat ass too
Uh!!!
