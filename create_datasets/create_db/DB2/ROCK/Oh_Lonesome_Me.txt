Everybody's going out and having fun.
I'm a fool for staying home and having none.
I can't get over how she set me free.
Oh, lonesome me.

There must be some way that I can lose these lonesome blues.
Forget about my past and find someone new.
I've thought of everything from A to Z.
Oh, lonesome me.

I'll bet she's not like me.
She's out and fancy-free.
Flirting with the boys with all her charms.
But I still love her so.
And brother, don't you know.
I'd welcome her right back here in my arms.

There must be someway that I can lose these lonesome blues.
Forget about my past and find someone new.
I can't get over how she set me free.
Oh, lonesome me.
