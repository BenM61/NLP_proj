If you were mine (ooh)
If you were mine (ooh)

Left to right, at the lights, we're speeding down the road
Leave it all, all behind, everything you think you know
You been hurt but I won't, won't fix you, you're not broke
What you are is beautiful to me

You could go left, but know I'm right
You gotta make, make up your mind

We could go anywhere, but if we take it there
Bet I can make you go oh, oh, oh, oh
You on the other side, I-I can change your mind
Bet I can make you go oh, oh, oh, oh
If you were mine (ooh)
If you were mine (ooh)
You on the other side, I-I can change your mind
Bet I can make you go oh, oh, oh, oh

Flashing light in your eyes, like fire as it grows
I can fly, no, but I, I never can let go
You been hurt, so have I, yeah, we got scars to show
But I swear, it's worth it, wait and see

You could go left, but know I'm right
You gotta make, make up your mind

We could go anywhere, but if we take it there
Bet I can make you go oh, oh, oh, oh
You on the other side, I-I can change your mind
Bet I can make you go oh, oh, oh, oh
If you were mine (ooh)
If you were mine (ooh)
You on the other side, I-I can change your mind
Bet I can make you go oh, oh, oh, oh

Let me exercise your mind
Forget about the time, just for a minute
Let me take you to a different life
So you can fantasize, just wanna make it
We can go anywhere, hit the beach up 'til February 
Baby, Lil Boat's a millionaire, no, briefcase, questionnaire
Have you looking so pretty when we ride through the city
I'm the man with the power, now I'm feeling like 50 (Lil Boat)

We could go anywhere, but if we take it there
Bet I can make you go oh, oh, oh, oh
You on the other side, I-I can change your mind
Bet I can make you go oh, oh, oh, oh
If you were mine (ooh)
If you were mine (ooh)
You on the other side, I-I can change your mind
Bet I can make you go oh, oh, oh, oh
(If you were mine)
Bet I can make you go oh, oh, oh, oh
If you were mine 
(If you were mine) 
Bet I can make you go oh, oh, oh, oh
