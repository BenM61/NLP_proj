Been in town, my baby 
We just got to rock on 
Yeah, darling, we just got to go home 
I don't want no tutti-frutti, no lollipop 
Come on, baby, just rock, rock, rock 

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, honey 
We've been shakin' all night 
Oh, darlin', we just got to roll right 
Ah, oh, my head rock on, rock on 

Hey babe, hey babe, hey babe, hey babe
Hey babe, hey babe, hey babe, hey babe

I don't want no tutti-frutti, no lollipop 
Come on baby, just rock, rock, rock

Woo hoo, woo hoo, woo hoo, woo hoo  
Let's go

I don't want no tutti-frutti, no lollipop 
Come on baby, just rock, rock, yeah
