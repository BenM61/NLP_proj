There she goes dressed in black
And a string of pearls
Hair of gold falls down her back
She's natural
Walk into a crowded room
She takes me by the hand
Turning heads but I'm her man
She's natural
And she knows just what to do
How to get her message through
With brains and beauty too
It's not only skin deep
Gives a smile to everyone
Saves the best for me
When she does she
Tames the sun
Natural
There she goes dressed in black
And a string of pearls
Hair of gold falls down her back
She's natural
Natural
