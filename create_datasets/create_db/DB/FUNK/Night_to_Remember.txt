When you love someone, it's natural, not demanding
And that's one thing I'm proud to say I've found in you

So now my love to you, baby, I surrender

Get ready tonight

Celebrations in the heart 'cause we're united
And there's nothing in the world could come between me and you
We're together, and it keeps me so excited
To think of what the power of love can do
And I'm filled with a love that's, oh, so tender, yeah
