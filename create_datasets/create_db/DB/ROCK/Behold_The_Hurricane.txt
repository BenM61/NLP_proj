I'm in love with the night
Every breath of this house creaking
I'm familiar with the cold and the windows and the doors
And the sound of my heart beating
Beating in and out of time

And it's such a shame
I heard the wind say this morning
Be still my heart
I age by years at the mention of your name
What a pity this season
You remember me, my lover
I don't recognize myself
I'm not the man you love
Behold the hurricane
Behold the hurricane

I walk around these empty rooms
We once moved like the morning
Silhouettes they haunt this house
Like a memory haunts me now
As if it were a dream
As if it were a dream

And it's such a shame
I heard the wind say this morning
Be still my heart
I age by years at the mention of your name
What a pity this season
You remember me, my lover
I don't recognize myself
I'm not the man you love
Behold the hurricane
Behold the hurricane

I heard the moon has visions of her nightly
I heard the mighty rivers cry out her
I saw the heaven and the earth
I saw the heavens and the earth cry alone to you

And it's such a shame
I heard the wind say this morning
Be still my heart
I age by years at the mention of your name
What a pity this season
You remember me, my lover
I don't recognize myself
I'm not the man you love
Behold the hurricane
Behold the hurricane
