DJ, play that song a little louder
I gotta, gotta get him outta my head
Gotta dance the pain away
Can't go to sleep just yet

My baby, he left me high and dry
Can't be the man for me
Said he can't tell me why
He told me that he loves me
But he's gotta be alone
He doesn't need me anymore
Wants to do it on his own
He said he doesn't wanna run
But we hold each other back
I love him so hard, 
I would fall off track

DJ, play that song a little louder
I gotta, gotta get him outta my head
Gotta dance the pain away
Can't go to sleep just yet
DJ, can't you play a little harder?
I gotta, gotta get farther outta the zone
I need the beat for release
I can't get it on my own

How could he say that
He loves me unconditionally, 
But still put so many rules
And restrictions on me?
He told me, "No one's gonna love you
As much as I do, 
But I can't be the man
That you need me to."
He just couldn't hold my hand, 
But he couldn't let me go
Was afraid that I found someone
That loves me more
So he keeps me in his trap
While he walks out the gate
He knows he's gonna come back, 
He knows that it's too late

Save me, save me, 
This boy is trying to break me
I'm feeling it, I'm feeling it
I need someone to take me
