Loving in the past
Don't know how long I'm gonna last
Since you've been gone
Keep holding on
Holding on.
I'm holding on loving in the past
I'm holding on
Don't know how long I'm gonna last
Oh
I'm holding on since you've been gone
I keep holding on
Holding on
Ooh baby.
Nights
Nights can be so cold without someone to hold
Man was never meant to be alone.
And days
Days can be so long
How can I go on without you?
I'm haunted by those memories
Everywhere I turn I see your face
Baby.
I thought forgetting would be easy to do
But I realize that you just can not be replaced.
I'm holding on loving in the past

Dreams I have come to fear
Seeing you appear
'Cause when I wake to find that you're not there.
Maybe tomorrow will bring an end to the sorrow I feel
I feel
I feel
Girl.
I'm haunted by those memories

I'm holding on loving in the past

Holding on
Holding on.
Lovers come and go but you know it's a shame
When I'm making love to someone else and calling out your name.
Holding on
Holding on
Holding on
Holding on.
I'm holding on loving in the past

Loving in the past
Don't know how long I'm gonna last
Since you've been gone
Keep holding on
Holding on.
