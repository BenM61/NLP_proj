Here's a little story 'bout a Friday night,
Buckwild, 'cause yo, that's kind of my style,
Check it,
On the town with a girl named Kay-Bee,

And a bow-wow-wow yippie-yo yippie any way,
I was straight out illin',
Why do I say so? 'cause yo, my girl was home chillin',
Fancy restaurant me and Kay frontin',

It was called Lay... um, Jay... um, somethin',
I was ready to attack her, uh,
Giving the sex look like Dracula,
A little bit of soft music playin',

And Don Perrier, it was on, know what I'm sayin',
Every thing was lovely, but then,
What the damn, my girlfriend walked in,
Oh my goodness, danger, trouble, dread,
Oh I'm dead, mayday code red

My oh my, what am I to do?
Gotta get away, cause my girlfriend's coming through,
Um Jay, I gotta, um, well, see, there's well, this, um, exscuse me,
To the back with the mucho-quickness,

My girl's gonna kill me and leave no witnesses,
I'm in the bathroom hiding like a punk,
But there's bars on the windows, I can't jump,
Exit stage left, quickly plan be	,

Gotta find a way that my girl won't see me,
Crawling on the floor, I'm feeling sick,
Like this some old Charlie Chaplin flick,
(unknown) pound and a round a mile-a-minute,

This time I really done did it,
Down on my hands and knees on the floor,
I'm looking at the front door,
Ready, set, make the dash,

Her back is turned, maybe I can get past,
I almost made it, but then, damn, she turned her head,
Code red
Break it on down

All was perfect, the ship was sailing,
But now it's sinking, so yo, I'm bailin',
I kept on runnin' even though she saw me,
And I sat and waited at home for baby to call me,

I watched a little TV,
Phone started ringing 'bout 12:23,
I picked it up real slow, and said,
"Mmm... hello?",

She wasn't having it, she snapped, went berserk,
Girl made my head hurt,
I tried to be as cool as I could be,
I said hey, wasn't me,

She wasn't having that melody,
Needless to say, she left me,
Another brother just couldn't control his head, (the other one)
Code red
