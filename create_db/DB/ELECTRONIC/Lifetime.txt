I was reborn when I was broken
I wouldn't believe, I wouldn't believe, no
Been through a storm, no use in hoping
That you would come rescue me
Somehow your love set me free

And I, I can let my life pass me by
Or I can get down and try
Work it all out this lifetime
Work it on out this time
I can let it all pass me by
Or I can get down and try
Work it all out this lifetime, lifetime

There was a time when love wasn't chosen
Now I'm just open for more
Now I'm just reaching out for something better
Than I had before, girl
There ain't a bottom line in your world

Ooh and I, I can let my life pass me by
Or I can get down and try
Work it all out this lifetime
Work it on out this time

I can let it all pass me by
Or I can just try and try
I can move to the light
Oh if I take it one day at a time (oh I)
Oh spread my love out and fly
Oh I (I can move to the light)
Ooh I can just make you understand
That love is not a fairytale in a melody
If you want it you can have it girl
Maybe you will see, maybe you will see (ooh ooh)
Ooh oh oh whoa oh
Lifetime, lifetime

And I, I can let my life pass me by
Or I can get down and try
Work it all out this lifetime
Work it on out this time
I can let it all pass me by
Or I can get down and try
Work it all out this lifetime, lifetime
