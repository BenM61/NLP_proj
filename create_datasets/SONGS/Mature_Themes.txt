To be young as a girl with a boy to be one
For I solemnly devote myself to thee
I'm sorry but it's true
True but shameful and vile
So I'm not real and I won't call you
And I wanna talk about mature things daily

And I wanted to be good, I wanted to be good
And I wanted to be good now baby
I wanted to be good, to be good, to be good
And I wanted to be good, baby

Now let's take steps to rectify your whole life
Take this gift I gave to thee
A promise to be true
Embrace, imagine imaginations that suit you
Yeah I wanna talk about mature things, and blue things

And I wanted to be good, I wanted to be good
And I wanted to be good, my baby
I wanted to be good, to be good, to be good
And I wanted to be good, baby

I don't care at all bout the big or the small
The skies and the air between me
I don't care about you
I wish I was taller than 5 foot 4
35 years of my life spent computing it all

And I wanted to be good, I wanted to be good
And I wanted to be good, my baby
I wanted to be good, to be good, to be good
And I wanted to be good, my baby
