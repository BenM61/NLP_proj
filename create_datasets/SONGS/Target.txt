You flicker like a mile high neon sign
Hot and cold so no one knows your mind
I was gonna let you win but I won't break

For an hour I held the moon on a string
Now this moments left till the world begins
Everything is possible, it's beautiful

When will you wake up, see what's happening
Right before your eyes, no
And if you must blow hot cold take a swing
You will hit the target every time

And so I look before I leap and I see
Wolves are at the door with my enemies
I was gonna let them win but then you say

Watch the stars defeating my enemy
It's too far for them to bring you to me
Everything is possible, it's beautiful

When will you wake up, see what's happening
Right before your eyes, no
And if you must blow hot cold take a swing
You will hit the target every time

When will you wake up, see what's happening
Right before your eyes
And if you must blow hot cold take a swing
You will hit the target every time

I reached the water's edge
I wished that I could hold everybody's breath
Until no one has any left, you take me to the edge
You're being called to follow the footprints that I left behind

Listen up, I'll sing to you how I can
Out of luck, now time is all that we have
Think about yourself and you'll kill all you love

I know our makers love all the mess they make
Out of sight behind these eyes you'll stay
Where everything is possible, it's beautiful

When will you wake up, see what's happening
Right before your eyes, no
And if you must blow hot cold take a swing
You will hit the target every time

When will you wake up, see what's happening
Right before your eyes
And if you must blow hot cold take a swing
You will hit the target every time
