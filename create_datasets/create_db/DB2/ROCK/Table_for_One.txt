Just get it over and done with
Tell me you've found someone knew
Then I'll stop with all the questions
I'll stop bugging you

I know you don't need a reason
'Cause I've been away so long
But don't tell me you love him
If it's true, then I won't come home

Every one of our friends
Said we'd get back together
Well give me a table for one
'Cause they're all wrong

Looks like it really is over
We haven't spoken for a year
And your voice is so far away
I could hardly hear you speak

I know you've got a new boyfriend
I read about it in a dream
You got lost in the blue mountains
On a long weekend what a shame

Every one of our friends
Said we'd get back together
Well give me a table for one
'Cause they're all wrong
