How did I let you slip through the cracks?
How did I let you stab me in the back?
You were my brother, you were my friend
I pray, no salvation for you in the end

(Unpredictable) trusting you was a fucking mistake
(Unforgivable) you will sweat in the pit that you make
Nothing can save you now

Now you're just a memory 
In my past is where you'll stay
Had my trust, threw it away
You'd better keep your distance from me

There's no forgiveness for what you've done
I'm coming for you and I'm out for blood
You are a liar, you are a thief
Spare me the pleasure of your company

(Unpredictable) trusting you was a fucking mistake
(Unforgivable) you will sweat in the pit that you make
Nothing can you save you now

Now you're just a memory 
In my past is where you'll stay
Had my trust, threw it away
You'd better keep your distance from me
Now you're just a memory
In my past is where you'll stay
Now I'm better off this way
You'd better keep your distance from me

Someone like you, is gonna die alone
You're gonna die alone, you're gonna die alone
Someone like you is gonna die alone, 
You're gonna die alone, you're gonna die alone
(You're gonna die, you're gonna die, you're gonna die alone)

Now you're just a memory 
In my past is where you'll stay 
Had my trust, threw it away
You'd better keep your distance from me
Now you're just a memory 
In my past is where you'll stay
Now I'm better off this way
You'd better keep your distance from me
