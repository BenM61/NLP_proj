The rhythm of our lives is changing day by day
It seems no matter what I do or what I say
That I'm always there for you
But you're never here for me

So many times you take me halfway to my dreams
But then you close the door, and every time it seems
That I'm always there for you
But you're never here for me
Yes, I'm always there for you
But you're never here for me

The rhythm of our lives is changing day by day
It seems no matter what I do or what I say
That I'm always there for you
But you're never here for me
Yes, I'm always there for you

I am always there for you
But you're never here for me
Yes, I'm always there for you
But you're never here for me

I'm always there for you
I'm always there for you
I'm always there for you
I'm always there for you
