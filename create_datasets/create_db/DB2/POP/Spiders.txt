She's got spiders inside her head
She's in danger she's easily led
She's on a mission from morning till night
She takes pictures with infra-red light

Secret agent miss Z-P-19
I still love you miss Z-P-19
But every morning when she jumps out of bed
She shakes the spiders playing inside her head

Oh my baby what shall we do
Babys in a black web I'm feeling blue
Johnnys in the cornershop waiting for you
He's got lots of

Lookout Johnny she's got spiders
Inside her head
She can't control her baby spiders
She wants them dead

She's got radar remote control
She's got Tv in every hole
She's got camera behind her eyes
She's warm and dangerous in every disguise

Oh my baby what shall we do
Babys in a black web I'm feeling blue
Johhnys in the cornershop waiting for you
He's got lots of 
Lookout Johnny she's got spiders
All around her door
She can't control her baby spiders
Anymore

She's up and humming at the discostation
When all she really wants is regulations
You're up and humming at the discostation
Up and spinning like a yo yo 

And every morning when she catches her train
She taps the telephones in passenger brains
