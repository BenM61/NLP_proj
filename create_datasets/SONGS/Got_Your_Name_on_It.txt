When the air comes in at night
It almost seems to call out your name
When it's dark out, when it's light
The seasons change
But your love remains

And there's a blue sky
Got your name on it, got your name on it
And when the sun shines
Got your name on it, got your name on it
Even this heart of mine
Got your name on it, got your name on it
So I never will forget you

When the leaves fall past my knees
Reminds me that I can't live without you
Something you are changes me
Into something I wanna be

And there's a blue sky
Got your name on it, got your name on it
And when the sun shines
Got your name on it, got your name on it
Even this heart of mine
Got your name on it, got your name on it
So I never will forget you

Never could remember names
Always seem to forget a face
But if my memory of you should fade
All I gotta do is look up

And there's a blue sky
Got your name on it, got your name on it
And when the sun shines
Got your name on it, got your name on it
Even this heart of mine
Got your name on it, got your name on it
So I never will forget you
