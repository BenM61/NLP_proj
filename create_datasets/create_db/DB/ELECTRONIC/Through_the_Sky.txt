Every thing's been said and done
What else is there to say
When tomorrow's been and gone
And given in to yesterday

If I'd known before the things that I know now
I'd be way above the ground
A thousand miles high
Spinning and spiraling through the sky

Waiting for the sun to shine
And brighten up my days
Drifting, floating in and out of time
You came and took my breath away

Now we're climbing up above the highest cloud
And we're never coming down, a thousand miles high
Spinning and spiraling through the sky
Through the sky

High as the moon and the stars above
Out of our minds and in love
Through the sky
