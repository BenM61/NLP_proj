If I were the type to play around
It wouldn't be so bad,
But I didn't know my way around
And what a time I had!

I was taken for a sleigh ride in July.
Oh, I must have been a set up for a sigh.
A mocking bird was whistling a sentimental tune
And I didn't know enough to come in out of the moonlight.

So, the big romance was only make believe,
Just a sleigh ride on a balmy summer eve.
My dreams were safe all winter
And then to think that I
Was taken for a sleigh ride in July.
