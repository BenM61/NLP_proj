Show me the colour of love 
Somehow it seems like a sign from above 
Get closer 
Love is all we need 
The colour of love 

I have been watching you all night 
I know you can feel it too 
I'm trembling inside 
I love you 

Back in time we met 
Those days we had I'll never forget 
I can't live without you 
A love so true 

True love is what you've given me 
I'll be there if you feel the same 
You're the one I see 
There's no shame
