Al di la means you are far above me, very far
Al di la, as distant as the lovely evening star
Where you walk flowers bloom

When you smile all the gloom turns to sunshine
And my heart opens wide
When you're gone, it fades inside and seems to have died

Al di la, I wondered as I drifted where you were
Al di la, the fog around me lifted, there you were
In the kiss that I gave was the love I had saved for a lifetime
Then I knew all of you was completely mine
