The gods of past and future, returning from the sky
Defenders of the holy, they are soaring on high
All slaves of evils' kingdom, dropping down like flies
The final raging battle that's when the evil dies

The poison of illusion, the world falls asleep
The evil reigns its kingdom by cunning and deceit
The force of seduction, chaos in the game
Man is trapped in blindness, praising Dorkas' name

Darkness falls and light will rise
The force of judgment finally strikes

Victory

Self destructive mankind's like wax in his hands
War and plain destruction are fit to set an end
A vulnerable system to serve the evil's way
Raising all its madness until the final day

Terror reigns in the prophecy
"Babylon" will fall, so plain to foresee
A nightmare rules the mirage of gold
Slipping to damnation by trying to hold

The rivalry is dying, the long awaited end
Destruction of all evil, no power could defend
Dorkas' crown is falling, he's melting down in pain
His kingdom falls to pieces, dying in the flame
