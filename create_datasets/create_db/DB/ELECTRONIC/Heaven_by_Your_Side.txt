You and I cannot hide
The love we feel inside
The words we need to say

I feel that I have always walked alone
But now that you're here with me
There'll always be a place that I can go

Suddenly our  destiny has started to unfold

When you're next to me
I can see the greatest story love has ever told

Now my life is blessed with the love of an angel 
How can it be true
Somebody to keep the dream alive
The dream I found in you

I always thought the love would be the strangest thing to me
But when we touch
I realize that I found my place in heaven by your side

I could fly when you smile
I'd walk a thousand miles 
To hear you call my name

Now that I have finally found the one
Who will be there for me eternally
My everlasting sun

Suddenly our destiny has started to unfold

When you're next to me
I can see the greatest story love has ever told

Now my life is blessed with the love of an angel 
How can it be true
Somebody to keep the dream alive
The dream I found in you

I always thought the love would be the strangest thing to me
But when we touch
I realize that I found my place in heaven by your side

That I've found my place in heaven by your side

Heaven by your side
Heaven by your side 
Heaven by your side

And when you're next to me
I can see the greatest story love has ever told

Now my life is blessed with the love of an angel 
How can it be true
Somebody to keep the dream alive
The dream I found in you

I always thought the love would be the strangest thing to me
But when we touch
I realize that I found my place in heaven by your side

Now my life is blessed with the love of an angel (heaven by your side)
Somebody who keep the dream alive (the dream I found in you)
I always thought that love would be the strangest thing to me

But when we touch, I realise 
That I found my place in heaven by your side
