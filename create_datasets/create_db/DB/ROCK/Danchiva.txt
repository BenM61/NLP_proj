Think about the place behind your eyes
Then think about the darkness, when you turn out the lights
Think about the space between the notes
Well that's the Dancashiva
Don't ask me where it goes

[Chorus]
Rollin' rollin'
Shifting like the sands
Rollin' rollin'
Twisting in the wind

Never looking back again...
Find the darkest night that you can find
And see if you can read between the lines
'Cause in between your memories
Desires & your dreams, you'll find the Dancashiva naturally

[Chorus]

Go to the seashore one fine day
Pretend that you're a bubble on a wave
Ocean keeps on going
Bubble bound to break
Leaving Dansachiva in the wake

[Chorus]
