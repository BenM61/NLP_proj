You've got your world and I've got mine and it's a shame
Two grownup worlds that will never be the same

Why can't we be like storybook children?
Running through the rain, hand in hand, across the meadow
Why can't we be like storybook children?
In a wonderland where nothing is planned for tomorrow

You've got his ring, you've got his heart, you've got his baby
And it's too late for us to turn and start again

Why can't we be like storybook children?
Running through the rain, hand in hand, across the meadow
Why can't we be like storybook children?
In a wonderland where nothing is planned for tomorrow

How happy we could be
If only we were storybook children, storybook children
Storybook children, storybook children, storybook children
