[Chorus]
One dream in all of us still shining,
One star, the ever lasting light,
So alone, so lost inside, to the ending paradise,
United, victorious, the hearts of our nation tonight.

In the dark December morning light,
Far strong to the burning winds, the fires of Hell will forsake me,
Shattering the chains that ever bind us,
Suffering their pain eternally.

For strong, smash the silence, carry on like before,
Fires burn, still we battle, lost so far away,
Storm with hail fire raging, sun shines down as they kneel,
Lost in times and long forgotten, governing miles away.

Tears fall inside the dream, our last days gone by,
Still alive we feel the pain tonight,
Stars fall through blackened clouds, and dreams that miss rains,
A twilight star in the thousand lights for me.

[Chorus]

And still we save a breath for the world,
Life brings up for us all,
United, victorious, the hearts of our nation tonight.

One dream in all of us still shining,
One star, the ever lasting light

[Chorus]

And still we save a breath for the world,
Life brings up for us all,
United, victorious, the hearts of our nation tonight. [Repeat: x2]
