Baby, I want ya
Nobody knows just how it feels
Certain, a dream, yeah
You're giving me something not so real

I'll be willing, I'll be a fool
I'll be something that you'd do
Baby, ooh
Nobody knows it feels so good

Time fades more
Than I want to say
Has gone away, tell me
What do I have to do to behave?

Baby, commander
Is there a deal that we can reach?
If ya feel the hunger
If you're in need of some relief

I'll be beggin', I'll be blue
I'll be something that you do
Baby, remember
Nothing can ever come of you

Time fades more
Than I want to say
Has gone away, tell me
What do I have to do to behave?

Come on, when ya gonna happen?
