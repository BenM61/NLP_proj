My head
Is spinning round
My heart
Is in my shoes, yeah
I went and set
The Thames on fire
Oh, now
I must come back down
She's laughing
In her sleeve boys
I can feel it in my bones
Oh, but anywhere
I'm gonna lay my head
I'm gonna call my home

Well
I see that the world
Is upside-down
Seems that my pockets
Were filled up with gold
And now the clouds
Well they've covered over
And the wind is blowing cold
Well I don't need anybody
Because I learned
I learned to be alone
Well I said anywhere
Anywhere
Anywhere I lay my head
Boys
Well
I gonna call my home
