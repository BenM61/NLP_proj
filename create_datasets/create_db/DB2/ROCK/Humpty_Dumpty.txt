Say you were split, you were split in fragments
And none of the pieces would talk to you
Wouldn't you want to be who you had been
Well baby I want that too

So better take the keys and drive forever
Staying won't put these futures back together
All the perfect drugs and superheros
Wouldn't be enough to bring me up to zero

Baby, I bet you've been more than patience
Saying it's not a catastrophe
But I'm not the girl you once put your faith in
Just someone who looks like me

So better take the keys and drive forever
Staying won't put these futures back together
All the perfect drugs and superheros
Wouldn't be enough to bring me up to zero

So get out while you can
Get out while you can baby I'm pouring quick sand
And sinking is all I have planned
So better just go

Oh, better take the keys and drive forever
Staying won't put these futures back together
All the perfect drugs and superheros
Wouldn't be enough to bring me up to zero

All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put baby together again
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put baby together again
