Sometimes the river flows but nothing breathes.
A train arrives but never leaves.
It's a shame.
Oh life - like love that walks out of the door,
Of being rich or being poor.
Such a shame.
But it's then, then that faith arrives
To make you feel at least alive.
And that's why you should keep on aiming high,
Just seek yourself and you will shine.

You've go to search for the hero inside yourself,
Search for the secrets you hide.
Search for the hero inside yourself
Until you find the key to your life.

In this life, long and hard though it may seem,
Live it as you'd live a dream.
Aim so high.
Just keep the flame of truth burning bright.
The missing treasure you must find
because you and only you alone
can build a bridge across the stream.
Weave your spell in life's rich tapestry -
Your passport to a feel supreme.

You've go to search for the hero inside yourself,
Search for the secrets you hide.
Search for the hero inside yourself
Until you find the key to your life.

Search inside yourself. (You've got to search) 
Search inside yourself. (You've got to search)
Search inside yourself. (You've got to search)

You've go to search for the hero inside yourself,
Search for the secrets you hide.
Search for the hero inside yourself
Until you find the key to your life.

You've go to search for the hero inside yourself,
Search for the secrets you hide.
Search for the hero inside yourself
Until you find the key to your life.

You've got to.
(Search inside yourself) 
You've got to.
(Search inside yourself)
You've got to.
(Search inside yourself)

Search.
