There's lightning's flashing in my mirror,
Thunder's rolling up behind.
Big blue clouds are going to roll in
Full of tears to make me blind.
I can't let his memory catch me.
I can't stop to cry no more.
I'm just running down the highway,

One jump ahead of the storm.
One jump ahead of the crying,
One jump ahead of his cold deceiving arms.
One jump ahead of the lying,
One jump ahead of the storm.
One day I looked on the horizon,

I saw his love just wouldn't last.
Before my mind was torn to pieces.
I had to leave and get out fast.
So I slipped out of his power.
I saw my chance and got me gone
Before the rain could start to falling.

One jump ahead of the storm.
One jump ahead of the crying,
One jump ahead of his cold deceiving arms.
One jump ahead of the lying,
One jump ahead of the storm.
One jump ahead of the storm.

Said I'm one jump ahead of the storm.
Got to keep on running down the highway
Got to keep on running down the highway
