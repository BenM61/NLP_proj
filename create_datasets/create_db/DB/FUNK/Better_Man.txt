I don't want much
I just wanna be a better man
To my baby
Give me your good luck
I was singing with them Jezebels
Under perfume sheets
Got a golden smile, heart overflow
But got us in love, but it wasn't enough

What can I do? What can I do?
To get back to your heart
I'd swim the Mississippi river
If you would give me another start, girl

All night long I was out
Out till the morning
But baby you're tender
Lust when I'm longing
Baby please, I'm down on my knees begging
I thirst for you girl
Baby I'm running to your well

What can I do? What can I do?
To get back to your heart
I'd swim the Mississippi river
If you would give me another start, girl

What can I do? What can I do?
To get back to your heart
I'd swim the Mississippi river

What can I do? What can I do?
To get back to your heart
I'd swim the Mississippi river
If you would give me another start, girl
