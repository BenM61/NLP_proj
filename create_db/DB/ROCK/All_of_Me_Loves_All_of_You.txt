Shoo be doo ay, I got something to say
Shoo be doo I, gotta try
To tell you that I, I, I, I really love you, love you
Shoo be doo ay, gotta say it my way
It may not be fancy, I know
But I said it before, and I'll say it again
And again, and again, and again

All of me loves all of you
And every little thing you do
All of me loves all of you
Tell me do, do you love me, too?

Sha la la lee, I'm so happy to be
Sha la la loo, here with you
I'm saying that you, you, you, you really do it to me
Sha la la lo, I just want you to know
I mean every word that I say
Though I said it before still I'll say it again
And again, and again, and again

All of me loves all of you
And every little thing you do
All of me loves all of you
Tell me do, do you love me, too?
