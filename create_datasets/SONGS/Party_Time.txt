Summertime is gone
And I don't wanna lose you
I don't wanna see you any more
Forget about the sun

I want my city
I want what's pretty too
Party time Party time
Party time Party time

Take me to the place
That makes me happy
I think I'm ready too
Don't cha know my name

I knew it yesterday
We don't have much to say
Party time Party time
Party time Party time

Summertime is gone
And I don't wanna lose you
I don't wanna see you any more
Forget about the sun

I want my city
I want what's pretty, too
Party time Party time
Party time Party time
