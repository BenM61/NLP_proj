A-yo
Rock you, I got you
Tru dat, now who dat?
But you at? Brandy
I knew that
The Q joint, the new point
The funk fellas ???
R&B and Rap fanatic
???
Smooth criminals
Ooh wee we lovable, huggable, snuggable
DFC
H to the E to the A to the V to the Y
Brandy sweet like candy, get fly

[Brandy]
Boy, close your eyes
Let the rhythm get into you
Don't try to fight it
There ain't nothing that you can do, oh oh

Relax your mind
Lay back and groove with my mine
You gotta feel that heat
And we can ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

Chorus:
I wanna rock with you (all the night)
Dance you into day ('til the sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (all the night)
Rock the night away

[Brandy]
Boy, out on the floor
There ain't nobody there but us
Boy, when you dance, when you dance
There's a magic that must be love, oh oooh

Just take it slow, uh
We got so far to go
When you feel that heat
And we're gonna ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

Chorus

[Brandy]
And when the groove is dead and gone (dead and gone)
You know that love survives
And we can rock forever, oh whoa oh

[Heavy D.]
Overseas trashin'
My passion for Hip Hop
?
I clock dollas and a rip spot
Make moves, smooth do's like Q
Attract fly honeys with exotic
? and money
I can make it hotter
?
Freshman, so don't test me
You go 1, 2, 3 and B's in da house
And I'm out

[Chorus]
