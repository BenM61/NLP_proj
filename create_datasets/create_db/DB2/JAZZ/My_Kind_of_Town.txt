Now this could only happen to a guy like me
And only happen in a town like this
And so I say to each of you most gratefully
As I throw each one of you a kiss

This is my kind of town, Chicago is
My kind of town, Chicago is
My kind of people too
People who smile at you

And each time I roam, Chicago is
It's calling me home, Chicago is
It makes me grin like a clown
It's my, my kind of town

This is my kind of town 
My kind of town, Chicago is
My kind of razzmatazz
And it has, all that jazz

And each time I leave, Chicago is
It's grabbin' my sleeve, Chicago is
The Wrigley building, Chicago is
The jumpin' pump room, Chicago is
One town that won't let you down
It's my kind of town
Chicago, Chicago, Chicago
My kind of town
Chicago!
