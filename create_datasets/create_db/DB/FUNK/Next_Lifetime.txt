First time that I saw you boy
It was a warm and sunny day
All I know is I wanted you
I really hoped you looked my way
When you smiled at me
So warm and sweet
I could not stay
You make me feel like a itty-bitty girl
What do you do to me

I guess I'll see you next lifetime
No hard feelings
I guess I'll see you next lifetime
I'm gonna be there

Your energy, feels so damn good to me
It picks me up don't want to come down
You got me spinning all around

Wait, wait a little while

See it ain't nothing wrong with dreaming
Boy don't get me wrong
'Cause every time (every time)  I see you (every single time)
I know just how strong (every single time)
That my love is for my baby
But emotions just don't lie
Well I know I'm a lot of woman
But not enough to divide the pie
