If I had one wish boy
I'd wish you next to me
And it could be in summer
Fall or spring boy cause
You make my heart sing

I want to give my heart my
Soul my love to you oh baby
Yeah cause every day I'm not
With you I'm missin' you like
Crazy. I need for you to love
Me

I need for you to love me
(Love me) hold me (hold me)
Touch (touch me) down deep
In my soul never let you go
Of the love we share no one
Compares to you

I'll never let you go
(I'll never let you go)
'Cause I really love you
So oh I-I'll never let
You go oh no (oh on on)

If you must know the truth
Boy I'm nothing without you
It's funny how I know what
People mean boy when it's
To good to be true

Because you give me joy
Good love good times such
Happiness oh yeah and every
Day I thank the Lord for
You I feel so blessed I need
For you to love

I need for you to love me

Touch me (touch me) down deep

If you only knew what you
Really do ain't never had
No one that does it quite
Like you do you could spend
Half a lifetime tryin' to find
One like you that's why I am
So glad I found you baby I
Wished upon a star it came
True darling I need for you to

I need for you to love me
(To love) hold me (hold me)
Touch me (touch me) down deep
In my soul (deep in my soul)
Never let it go (oh yeah) oh

Let you go I'll never let you go)
'Cause I really love you so oh I-
