You've been gone
So long
No matter who's right
No matter who's wrong
Come on home
Come on home
Cause that's where you belong girl

Every morning
I say my grace
Hoping that we'll both
Get back into the race
Come on home
Come on home
Cause that's where you belong girl

I know the bright lights
They all glitter like gold
But girl we ain't gettin' no younger
And this is gettin' old
Come on home
Come on home
Cause that's where you belong girl

I know we both..
We both broke the law
Let's get together girl
And call it a draw
Come on home
Come on home
Cause that's where you belong girl

Hm hm hm
Hm hm hm
Hm hm hm
Come on home
Come on home
Cause that's where you belong girl
