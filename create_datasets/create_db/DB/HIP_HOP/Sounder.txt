You couldn't escape this music even if your name's Houdini
Our tracks, they last for Life and don't disappear like a genie
Communicating through your airwaves like a giant C.B.
'Cause this one's for your radios over, do you receive me?

Our music is so hot, it feels like the sun in Tahiti
We rickety rock, Gorillaz style is buck wild, believe me
We heavyweights who phase ya like Ali did with Frasier
We spit the most flava but musically we'll amaze ya

We've been blessed and we've been gifted like Jesus in His manger
Won't you shout Hallelujah! Here comes your music savior?
From your heart to your mind, your spirits to your souls
We come to take control with the Gorillaz on patrol

See, our rhymes possess the powers of a superhero
Supernaturally, we rock the mic but wit' a natural flow
If you didn't know before, you know now, we told you so
Gorillaz rock your dome just like the one in Tokyo

It's a hard dream to contemplate, I could fall into the abyss
And I love this interlude, it's the reason to deliver
And they called onto me, says they came to talk to me though
The more of us that lies, I guess kids don't live or die

'Cause we're makin' this music that's making you lose it
So, people don't abuse it and there ain't no way for you to refuse it
Gorillaz be the army that's startin' this pardy ardy
Makin' more noise than carnivals mixed with the mardi gradi

We're comin' through your town with the sound that's so profound
Gorillaz with the rappers that straight from the underground
We're tearin' it down, makin' you feel this sort of force
Knockin' you to your senses and knockin' you off your course

'Cause we're the source, got you feelin' that so appealing
We got you jumpin' around and bouncin' off of the ceiling
Makin' music ya feeling from Baltimore into Bristol
I know you're hearin' me 'cause my voice is clearer than crystal

The casual, supernatural flows I be exposin'
Makin' sure that you're frozen and makin' sure that I'm chosen
To rip a score, we make you damage the dance floor
Gorillaz and Phi Life'll give you what you ask for

It's a hard dream to contemplate, I could fall into the abyss
And I love this interlude, it's the reason to deliver
And they called onto me, says they came to talk to me though
The more of us that lies, I guess kids don't live or die

Let Gorillaz be you guiding light and your shining star
Whether you be home alone or drivin' in your car
Don't matter who ya are, whether you be near or far
You'll be feelin' entertained by our music repertoire

See, our poems, they be flowin' like rivers and reservoirs
'Cause Gorillaz, we be out in this world like men of mars
We rap stars with supernatural spars
We leave your brains amazed with this super music of ours

So put yous hands up and stand up, it's time to get down
'Cause Gorillaz and Phi Life, we be breakin' you 'round
From the right to the left, from the skies to the ground
We're coverin' all angles and you can't escape the sound

On the track, it's laid back, we've come to spray raps
Keep it chilled and relaxed but we still sound phat
It's like that, when we write raps
We're not from the empire but we still strike back

So put your hands up and stand up, it's time to get down
Gorillaz and Phi Life, we be breakin' you 'round

So put your hands up and stand up, it's time to get down
Gorillaz and Phi Life, we be breakin' you 'round

So put your hands up and stand up, it's time to get down
Gorillaz and Phi Life, we be breakin' you 'round
