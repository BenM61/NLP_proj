So you're in love with someone else
Someone who burns within your soul
And it looks like I am the last to know
I hear you've never felt so alive
So much desire beyond control
And as usual I am the last to know

The last to know
How you're feeling
The last to know
Where you are

The last to know
If you're happy now
Or if he's treating you, like I treated you
Or if he's cruel
I'll be the last to know

We spent summers up beyond the bay
And you said these are such prefect days
That if the bomb drops baby
I want to be the last to know

But now you're living up behind the hill
And though we share the same city and feel the same sun
When your winter comes
I'll be the last to know

Always the last to know
How you're feeling
The last to know
Where you are

The last to know
If you're happy now
Or if he's pleading with you, like I pleaded with you
If you go, don't let me be the last to know
Don't let me be the last to know

Creations gone crazy

The TV's gone mad

Now you're the only sane thing that I have

Always the last to know
How you're feeling
The last to know
Where you are

The last to know
If you're happy now
Or if he's cheating on you, like I cheated on you
Oh, oh, oh

You were the last to know
You were the last to know
Don't let me be the last to know
