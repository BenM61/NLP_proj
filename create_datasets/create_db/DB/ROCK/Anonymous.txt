Behind this mask, there is no religion
No politics, no dead presidents make my decisions
Behind this mask (behind this mask), we are equal
We are all anonymous

Behind this mask (behind this mask, behind this mask), we are you
We want the same things you want
We do what it takes to uncover the truth
We run the same risks you run (you run)
But we'll be damned if we run them for nothing

We are anonymous, cover our faces to uncover ourselves
We are anonymous, we want the same things you want
We do what it takes to uncover the truth

The face of the faceless
The names of the nameless
The voiceless, the selfless
Expect us, expect us

We are anonymous
Cover our faces to uncover ourselves
We are anonymous

Cover our faces to uncover ourselves

One day you'll read about us, but you won't know that it's me
One day you'll see everything that we stand for
One day we'll go down swinging, 'cause I know it's a fight worth fighting
One day you'll see everything that we stand for
One day you'll finally see that we don't sleep so safely
One day you'll see everything that we stand for
The face of the faceless, the names of the nameless
The voiceless, the selfless, accept us, expect us

We are anonymous
Cover our faces to uncover ourselves

We are anonymous
Cover our faces to uncover ourselves
Cover our faces to uncover ourselves
Cover our faces to uncover ourselves
Cover our faces to uncover ourselves
Cover our faces to uncover ourselves
Cover our faces to uncover ourselves
Cover our faces to uncover ourselves
