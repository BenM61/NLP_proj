I can still feel
That summer wind blowin'
Those four wheels rollin'
Underneath me and you
I can still feel
That freedom just fly by
And it's burning like a wildfire in the dark that night
We were pickin' up speed
You were whisperin' to me
Baby just gun it
Oh man we were runnin'
Wide open
A hundred mile an hour
Heart's my race against the curfew car
On out of here highway
Wide open
Life in the fast lane
Radio turned up as loud as it can go
And the speakers blown
We didn't even know where we were goin'
Wide open
On a straight stretch
Some yellow lined blacktop
You said "What if we don't stop? Go all the way."
And I swear I never took my foot off
We were fallin', we were flyin'
We were chasin' down lightnin'

Wide open
A hundred mile an hour
Heart's my race against the curfew car
On out of here highway
Wide open
Life in the fast lane
Radio turned up as loud as it can go
And the speakers blown
We didn't even know where we were goin'
Wide open 
Wide open 
Wide open
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
