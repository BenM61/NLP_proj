[Chorus]
We need some positive vibes for these rainy days
Let the sun come out keep pushin' these clouds away
We need some positive vibes life's for fun so go and play
Let the sunlight in, brighten up your day

Let the vibes blow like the ocean breeze
Mamma always told me there'd be days like these
Keep your head right, just do as you please
Never interfere with an evil man's schemes
Keep your heart pure, conceive your own dreams
Respect your fellow man, the earth with the trees
The air that we breathe and the highest mountain peak
Bring truth from your soul to your mouth when you speak

No need to get loud .. messin with others, stressin' your brother, it's time to uncover
Time to choose another path you see
Cause the road most traveled's negativity
Put your fist down (fist down), throw your hands in the air
Respect yourself, be somebody who cares
Don't let life get you down, don't feel abused
Keep a positive view unto yourself be true

[Chorus]

Everyday's a new adventure You got to keep what you got
Livin' life in a studio bustin' rhymes in my socks
I got to keep my head up and always do what I feel
Avoidin all the evil and just keeping it real
(I need some positive vibes)
All these situations I keep hearin' about
People dyin' in planes and buildings crumbling down
This world goes round for no apparent reason
People robbin and theavin' just to feel good for the evening
(I need some positive vibes)
What happen' to everybody's peace and love
Throw your drinks the sky, raise your hands up above
Get yo hand out of the gutter and be respectful
We need some positive vibes for these rainy days so let it go
Don't never get it twisted when I'm on this track
D-Loc the kind kid that be kickin' it back
Of the class everyday I was high
Goin to school in 95 easy that how we ride

[chorus]

It's time to leave this rat race track down Babylon
Keep my head straight, keep my family movin' on
Find my own pace, create my own space
Detach my whole scene from this wicked rat race
These two-faced friends, the snakes in the grass
Daddy always told me there'd be men like that
So watch your own back keep your eye on your stash
Don't ever write a check that that ass can't cash

[Chorus]

We need some positive vibes
(Keep on reaching for it)
For these rainy days
(Keep on hoping for it)
Let the sun come out keep pushin' these clouds away
(What we need is, all we have is positive vibes)
We need some positive vibes
(What more can we say to you)
Life's for fun so go out and play
(What more can be said to you)
Let the Sunlight in, brighten up your day
(What we need is, all we have is positive vibes)
