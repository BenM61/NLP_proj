Morning, morning 
Feel so lonesome in the morning 
Morning, morning 
Morning brings me grief 

Sunshine, sunshine, 
Sunshine left upon my face 
And the secret of the shining 
Puts me in my running place 

Evening, evening 
Feel so lonesome in the evening 
Evening, evening 
Evening brings me grief 

Moonshine, moonshine 
Moonshine dots the hills with grace 
And the glory of the shining 
Seems to break my simple pace 

Nighttime, nighttime 
Feel so lonesome in the nighttime 
Nighttime, nighttime 
Does not bring me to relief 

Starshine, starshine 
Chills the moon upon my cheek 
Starshine, starshine 
Darling kiss me as I leave
