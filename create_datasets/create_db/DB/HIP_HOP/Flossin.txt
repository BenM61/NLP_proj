Say I'm flossing, say I'm bossing
Now I'm flossing, yeah, yeah

Yeah I'm flossing, flossing, I'm flossing, I'm flossing
Floss, floss, I'm a a boss, I should be from Boston
Say I'm flossing (I'm flossing)

You had it, you lost it

My vanilla girl like chocolate
My chocolate girl like caramel
My caramel girl like every flavored
Drippin' like the faucet
I'm flossing, I'm flossing

She just got her ass shots, wait until it softens
She bossing, she bossin' five stacks it costs
Everytime we hit the mall, they should bring a coffin
I'm cocky, I'm flossing, put a porch to the Porsche
It can get exhausting, all this fucking flossing
Diamonds in my teeth, when I smile I sparkle
I should be a dentist, I could teach you how to floss it

Yeah I'm flossing, yeah I'm flossing, yeah I'm flossing, yeah I'm flossing,
Floss, floss, I'ma a boss, I should be from Boston
Say I'm flossing (I'm flossing)

But this ain't Hugo Boss
Bitch we flossing, flossing, yeah we flossing, flossing

Called up some Hoochies, I'm 'bout to throw a party
Where'd she get that ass, she got it from her mama
I'm saucy, I'm saucing, I'm saucy bus' out, man
And I'm paid in full, I should be from Harlem
Just pulled up and rackin', we both was in Ferraris
Whoa kemosabe, flossing is a hobby
And I'm on your TV, whoa Hashetashe
All my ice is water, yours is wishy-washy

Yeah I'm flossing, yeah I'm flossing, yeah I'm flossing, yeah I'm flossing,
Floss, floss, I'ma a boss, I should be from Boston
Say I'm flossing (I'm flossing)
