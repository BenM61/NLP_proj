Saying I'm everything you need, oh yeah
You wanna know where we can go
All the way to Fernando
You wanna be my Nintendo
But you gotta know I don't play no games

Everything I say is true
I'd be a mess here without you
And I'll hold you down, you don't need to stress
So let me just lay upon your chest

Roll the weed and let me smoke the zest
And you can lay upon my chest

Tell me what you want, is it me, though?
Love it when you watch how my weed smokes so loud
Feel me?
And you best pick it up when I FaceTime
'Cause you know that you're all mine
Know I'ma roll in my car, come wherever you are
Come whenever you need to be together
