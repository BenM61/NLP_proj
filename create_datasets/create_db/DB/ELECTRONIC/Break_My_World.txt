I am the eye of the hurricane
I hear you cry yet I feel no pain
I wash away the hurt and broken chains
After all these years your heart's so cold to me

Give me all the things that you don't need
Fill me up with the air you breathe
If I ever see the day that you don't need me
Use me up, cut me dry, shut my mouth, say goodbye

I'll let go of what I know
Break my world
Break my world

I sit inside of an empty room
Your heart is heavy is heavy and it's lonely too
I give you more then I'm over you
After all this time your eyes are cold to me

Give me all the things that you don't need
Fill me up with the air you breathe
If I ever see the day that you don't want me
Use me up, cut me dry, shut my mouth, say goodbye

I'll let go of what I know
Break my world
Break my world
Break my world
Break my world

Use me up, cut me dry, shut my mouth, say goodbye
I'll let go of what I know
Break my world
Break my world
