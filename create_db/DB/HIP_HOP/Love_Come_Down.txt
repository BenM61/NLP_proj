(dirty money crew)
Yo, yea!
(show 'em how to move and show 'em how to move and show 'em how to move
And show 'em how to show 'em how to show 'em 
How to move and show 'em how to move 
And show 'em how to move in a room full of vultures)
Yo, yea! dis dat dirty money
Yea! dis is dirty money

Babe, I wanna wake up in the morning to yo face
And for the one you love I'm staring at you again
And tell me deep down that you feel the same
The same way (the same way)
Ooh babe I know within my heart my love don't change
That's why I'm play-in along with yo game
All dis shit here got me feelin' strange
Ooh babe!

[Chorus]
You make my love come down
You make my love come down
I feel you love me now
I feel you love me now
You make my love come down
You make my love come down
I feel you love me now
I feel you love me now
(dis is dirty money)

Babe, you got me caught up in dis love game
The funny thing is dat I don't mind playin'
I'm in it for the win so what you sayin'
I'm ready (I'm ready)
Ooh babe! my hearts all overloaded and your the blame
Lookin' for a future with you babe
Willing to give me your last name
Ooh babe!

[Chorus]

London Paris where we goin' next shit
I don't know what planet would you suggest?
Wherever we go you just bring a lil' dress
And I'll just take care of all the rest
I feel like affection I'm givin' you the best
I underestimated I'm the greatest one left
So if you ready to fly you beta take a deep breath
I put you in the sky and take yo heart up out yo chest
Now yo got me goin' in, we can sit up n da sun until yo skin change
Now what yo really know about ownin a big plane
Landin' on the auto bars poppin' champagne, ain't dat a damn shame
Come on

I wanna feel all I can feel
I wanna love I know is real
I cant believe this is happenin' to me
Baby right here is here I wanna be, ooh

You make my love come down
You make my love come down
I feel you love me now
I feel you love me now

You make my love come down
(dirty money crew)
I feel you love me now

(i ain't finished wit cha)
Now the funny thing is dat the world stops spinnin' 
When my energy in the air you could sail the world twice and never compare
Been around the world so many times da I got my own metals fair
Now London Paris where we goin' now
I don't know what planet would you suggest?
Wherever we go yo jus' bring a lil' dress
And I'll just take care of all the rest(dirty money come on)

(love me down)baby can you love me down
(can you ge me off)baby can you get me off
(repeat while diddy talks and it fades)
