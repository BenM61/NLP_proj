No moon at all, what a night
Even lightnin' bugs have dimmed their lights
Stars have disappeared from sight
And there's no moon at all

Don't make a sound, it's so dark
Even Fido is afraid to bark
What a perfect chance to park
And there's no moon at all

Should we want atmosphere for inspiration, dear
One kiss will make it clear
That tonight is right and bright moonlight might interfere

No moon at all way up above
This is nothin' like they told us of
Just to think we fell in love
And there's no moon at all

Should we want atmosphere for inspiration, dear
One kiss will make it clear
That tonight is right and bright moonlight might interfere

No moon at all up above
Aww, this is nothin' like they told us of
Just to think we fell in love
And there's no moon at all

Aww, there's no moon at all
There is no moon at all
No moon at all
