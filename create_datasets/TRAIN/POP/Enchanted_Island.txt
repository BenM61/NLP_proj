True love 
Is an enchanted island
And we have found that island
From which we'll never roam

We stand
On an enchanted island
A magic yours-and-m6 land
That we can call our home

If all around, we found
A sea of faces
I know your face is
The only one I'd see

True love
Is an enchanted island
And we're upon that island
Wherever we may be
