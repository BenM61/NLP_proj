When you take me by the hand
Tell me I'm your loving man
When you give me all your love
And do it the very best you can

When I get to be in your arms
When we're all all alone
When you whisper sweet in my ear
When you turn, turn me on

Oh, that's the way, uh-huh uh-huh
I like it, uh-huh, uh-huh
That's the way, uh-huh uh-huh
I like it, uh-huh, uh-huh
That's the way, uh-huh uh-huh
I like it, uh-huh, uh-huh
That's the way, uh-huh uh-huh
I like it, uh-huh, uh-huh

Babe, oh babe (that's the way, uh-huh, that's the way, uh-huh)
Babe, oh babe (that's the way, uh-huh, that's the way, uh-huh)
