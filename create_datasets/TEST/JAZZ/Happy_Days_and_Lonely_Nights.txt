My memory takes me to 
The wonderful nights we knew 
When I made love to you until the dawn. 
You left and to my surprise 
I'm laughing with tear dimmed eyes 
Because I realise 
I can't go on my darling.

With the parting of the ways
You took all my happy days
And left me lonely nights.
Morning never comes too soon
I can face the afternoon
But oh, those lonely nights.
I feel your arms around me, 
Your kisses linger yet, 
You taught me how to love you, 
Now teach me to forget!
You broke my heart a million ways
When you took my happy days
And left me lonely nights.

The beautiful month of May 
Without you is sad and grey, 
Oh, how I hate the day, I let you go. 
I find that my happiness,
Depends on your sweet caress
I thought I loved you less,
But now I know, my darling.

With the parting of the ways
You took all my happy days
And left me lonely nights.
Morning never comes too soon
I can face the afternoon
But oh, those lonely nights.
I feel your arms around me, 
Your kisses linger yet, 
You taught me how to love you, 
Now teach me to forget!
You broke my heart a million ways
When you took my happy days
And left me lonely nights.
