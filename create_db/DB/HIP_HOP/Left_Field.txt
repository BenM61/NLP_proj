If you step to the right, I step to the left
I'm too hard, to tell you that you're def

If you step to the right, I step to the left
I'm too hard, to tell you that you're def

If you step to the right, I step to the left
I'm too hard, to tell you that you're def

If you step to the right, I step to the left
I'm too hard, to tell you that you're def

You are my Bubblin Brown Sugah
But you Cram to Understand, I'm a man
Sensitivity, is a virtue
But if I don't show that, I hurt you
In front of your friends, we peck but expect me to hold on
'Cause we can't do that
Honey screw dat, and yes I do love you
But do we have to act like we're glued, together
All the time, boots on my mind
Fine wine with lips so girl take a sip
And let's get cozy, let me mow the.. lawn
'Cause you know we got it goin on.. and on
To the pawns, to the kings, to the queens
To your chest, checkmate
You know the rest

If you step to the right, I step to the left
I'm too hard, to tell you that you're def

If you step to the right, I step to the left
I'm too hard, to tell you that you're def

If you step to the right, I step to the left
I'm too hard, to tell you that you're def

If you step to the right, I step to the left
I'm too hard, to tell you that you're def

I got this girlfriend, but she's not really mine
'Cause on the end of girlfriend is the way that she's inclined
Dressed to impress but she don't play dress-up
To catch my attention cause I already messed up
See I get ribbed, cause she acts like I'm sibling
Playin a brother role puts a block between my goals
I'm sold on the thought, cause I know I can correct it
But I don't step, cause I'm scared she might reject it
So I play along just for a chance to be around her
Perhaps she'll catch my hints, and we can end this fencin
Then I'll make her my baby baby baby
Drivin' me crazy on the one and one tip
When will she stop this brother stuff?
Hookin' me up with girls that look busted, and rough
That run with the crew thinkin' that I want to screw
Why in the hell would I want her unless she looked as good as you?
But as usual, I step to the side
Content with givin' advice, and givin her a ride
Cause I gotta stay close, to the one that I adore
From afar I wait for her, my door stays ajar

If you step to the right, I step to the left
I'm too hard, to tell you that you're def

If you step to the right, I step to the left
I'm too hard, to tell you that you're def

If you step to the right, I step to the left
I'm too hard, to tell you that you're def

If you step to the right, I step to the left
I'm too hard, to tell you that you're def

Now here's the deal, my dollars spill
Throughout the mall, my eyeballs fall
I see this vision, I switch the mission
But scared of dissin, I change my condition
And keep on walkin, though she's hawkin'
I should be talkin, no I can't kill my rep
Yo she slept, and I just crept
Right on by, cause man I'm fly
Straight hardcore, through the door
Cause I'm much more, than Mr. Smooth Talker
That's for the pigeons, cause that's how I'm livin'
And I should be swimmin, in all the lovely women
But man I'm not, I wonder why
Is it because I'm too hard and too fly?
Hmm.. could be, nah forget it
There's just no woman out there to get widdit
Get to my car, remove my glock
It looks like tonight's another Blockbuster stop
Bust a couple of movies, sit back and wonder
Yo I think that chick woulda given me her number
Oh well, it's too late now
I hit the lightswitch 

If you step to the right, I step to the left
I'm too hard, to tell you that you're def

If you step to the right, I step to the left
I'm too hard, to tell you that you're def

If you step to the right, I step to the left
I'm too hard, to tell you that you're def

If you step to the right, I step to the left
I'm too hard, to tell you that you're def
