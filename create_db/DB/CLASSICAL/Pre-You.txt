Mysterious lost weekend in a land
where time stands still
Where people fall in love again
just for one more thrill
My girl and I went walking
by the Caribbean sea
Someone snorkeled by raised her head up high
And my girl said who's she? 

Chorus
Pre you a friend of mine who's old not new
Pre you she's just another girl that I once knew
A pleasant smile a pretty face
Another time another place
Pre you what's a guy supposed to do? 

We'll blame it on the weather
and the stars that shine above
For bringing us together and 
filling us with love
So don't you fret my lady,
'cause what we have is strong
Let her swim away
out into the bay
your place is here with me 

Chorus
She's pre-you just a friend
so don't be blue
Pre you she's only yesterday
just passing through
Another page in history
a stepping stone for you and me 
Pre you what's a guy supposed to do? 

Instumental 

Long ago we were close but the fire went out
She's a tease can't you tell
that's what she's all about
Like an old broken clock on the wall
she's got nothing to say
She was long ago she's so yesterday 

Chorus
She's pre you just a friend 
so don't be blue
Pre you she's only yesterday
just passing through
Another page in history
a stepping stone for you and me
Pre you what's a guy supposed to do?
