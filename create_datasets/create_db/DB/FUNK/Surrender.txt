Did you ever feel like there was
Something gonna happen and then,
Realize a part you had died
Perhaps created something better?
See I'm getting ready
To drop this feeling heavy.
I been experiencing
Feelings I can't hide.

So relax, try to let it flow.
Let our pre-concepts go.
No more hesitating.
Oh, things are gonna change.

Get up, get out, and breathe it in.
It's worth living.
There's something waiting to begin.
So let it!

Surrender, give in.
Let go to the feeling.
Just feel this feeling.
Surrender to what you're feeling.

Have you ever tried resisting
A feeling left you reeling,
Cause you realized that you'd been
Playing safe for so long?
You'd forgotten how good something tasted,
Realized the time you'd wasted.
Sometimes it's good to do
A thing you want to, mm-misbehaving.

So unwind, let me let it go,
Everything that you know.
I will give you something
That will blow your mind.

Get up, get out, and breathe it in.
It's worth living.
There's something waiting to begin.
So let it!

Surrender, give in.
Let go to the feeling.
Just feel this feeling.
Surrender to what you're feeling.

I want you to know that this is here now.
I want you to show me what you're feeling.
I want you to see how good this could be.
I want you to know this kind of healing.

I want you to know that this is here now.
I want you to show me what you're feeling.
I want you to see how good this could be.
I want you to know this kind of healing.
