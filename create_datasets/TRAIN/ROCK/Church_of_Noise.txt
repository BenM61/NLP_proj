She goes places I won't go
She knows things that I don't know

Welcome to the church of noise
Welcome to the church of noise

It takes more than intellect to be a musician
Put your soul into intellect, okay?

This goes way beyond beliefs
Take this far away from me

Welcome to the church of noise
Welcome to the church of noise

Empire's singin' on the back door step
Showband's dyin' on my radio set
Every light shines out on a Sunday

Heaven sent with guilt and regret
I am lost in your acetylene light, so bad
One more trip, one more trip to my head, to my head now

Red skies, summer marches on
We should go away together, mongrels in a mess forever

Welcome to the church of noise
Welcome to the church of noise

Welcome to the church of noise
Welcome to the church of noise
