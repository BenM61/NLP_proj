Oh sweet Jannie

Oh sweet Jannie
Girl, won't you come out tonight?
I want to take you walkin'
Way out in the clear moonlight

Oh baby, baby
Come on take me by my hand
Oh baby
Come on take me by my hand
I don't want to stop walkin'
'Til we get up to the preacher man, hey

I've been in love with you, baby
Ever since you were back in Sunday school
I've been in love with you, baby
Ever since you were back in Sunday school
And I knew right there and then
I just want to be your fool

Oh sweet Jannie
Baby, won't you come out tonight?
Alright
I said, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Come out tonight
I want to take you walkin'
Way out on a clear moonlight

One more time

Hey-hey-yeah, baby, baby
Baby, baby, alright
Baby, baby
Baby, come on out tonight
Yeah, we're gonna keep on
Walkin' way up in a clear moonlight

Oh baby, baby
Come on shuffle out tonight
Oh-oh, baby, baby, baby, baby
Come on shuffle out tonight
Gonna keep on shufflin'
Make ev'rything alright
