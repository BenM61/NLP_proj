You came into my life, You just made everything right.
And even though my man has left me behind,
I don't regret a thing for having you.

Thanks for my child,
I'm really thanking you, the man above
Thanks for my child
You brought me so much joy
This bundle of love
Thanks for my child
And though your father, He ran away free.

The love I have for you baby, Is the love I have in me
I'll stay and watch you grow, Yes I will!
I'll raise you by myself, A one woman show.

You make life worth singing a song
You make life worth singing a song'
With you right here with me,
I 'll have the strength to go on.

Thanks for my child
Here we are to today, the years have gone by
Thanks for my child
You grew before my eyes, time after time
Thanks for my child
I'll hold you in my arms, I hold you close to me

Rock a bye my baby, I'll rock you to sleep
I understand your language, Your baby talk
You forgot to crawl, Before you walked
There you are just looking so beautiful
And all the while, you are wrapped in blankets
You are my love child.

Thanks for my child
I really thanking you, The man above
Thanks for my child
You brought me so much joy, This bundle of love
Thanks for my child
And though your daddy, He ran away free
The love I have for you baby
Is the love I have in me, Inside of me
The love I have in me
I just know, I'll never let you go, no, no
No, no, no, oh yeh
Cause you're my sweet baby

Papa can't preach, Papa was a rolling stone because
He left his beautiful, Cause he left, us alone
But that's OK cause I'm you mother baby
I carried you for 9 months, And I'm gonna carry you
Until you can carry yourself On your own
I love you sweetheart, (child) I love you too mommy!
