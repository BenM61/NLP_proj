Maybe you've taken on a different name
Tired of playing everybody else's game
Maybe you're living in a jealous town
Oh so tired of rumors going round
What we do, under the influence of love

Maybe you'll try out a new set of clothes
Begin to like the things that you hated the most
There ain't no rule, there ain't no circumstance,
To save you baby now, when you're in a trance
What we do, under the influence of love

Hush now baby, don't cry
To make it right, we have to see both sides
And the day is never done...
Think about it

Maybe you learn how to communicate
With that someone who just can't wait
Maybe you'll see the world with different eyes
Maybe you'll even make a sacrifice
What we do, under the influence of love

Some they can't live within
Some they can't live without
When love finally arrives
Some they keep shutting it out and
Maybe this ones for you
Baby, don't be afraid
There ain't nothing you can do when it takes you away

Maybe you'll give up everything you've got
To prove you're right, when they say you're not
Maybe you'll change just about everything around you
Become a slave to the spell that bound you
What we do, under the influence of love

Hush now baby, don't cry
To make it right we have to see both sides
And the day is never done
Think about it - for the fortunate ones

Maybe you'll give up everything you've got
To prove you're right, when they say you're not
Maybe you'll change everything around you
Under the influence of love
