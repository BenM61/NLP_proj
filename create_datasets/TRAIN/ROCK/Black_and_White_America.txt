Martin Luther King, he had a vision
(And that's a fact)
He died so we could see, that was his mission 
(So don't look back)

There is no division, don't you understand
The future looks as though it has come around
And maybe we have finally found our common ground
We're the children of our father
If you're looking back don't bother
We're black and white America

In 1963 my father married 
(A black woman)
And when they walked the streets, they were in danger
(Look what you've done)

But they just kept on walking forward hand in hand
The future looks as though it has come around
And maybe we have finally found our common ground
We're the children of our father
If you're looking back don't bother
We're black and white America

The future looks as though it has come around
And maybe we have finally found our common ground
We're the children of our father
If you're looking back don't bother
We're black and white America

We've waited so long
We've waited so long

Black and white America
There is no division, don't you understand
The future looks as though it has come around
And maybe we have finally found our common ground
We're the children of our father
If you're looking back don't bother
We're black and white America

The future looks as though it has come around
And maybe we have finally found our common ground
We're the children of our father
If you're looking back don't bother
We're black and white America

The future looks as though it has come around
And maybe we have finally found our common ground
We're the children of our father
If you're looking back don't bother
We're black and white America

Oh, yeah
Black and white America 
Gonna keep on moving forward 
Oh blow it out
