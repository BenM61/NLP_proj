Long time gone
Just sitting here wondering why I carry on
I'm trying to find a place where I belong
(Do you wake up calling out my name)
'Cos it's easy to forget that's life a game
(Do you still think you're the one to blame?)
When tomorrow comes I'll miss you just the same and

Another night like this
And I'll be heading for the town
Another night like this
And there'll be action going down
Tomorrow night, no more hanging on
It makes no difference now you're gone
Another night and soon I will be leaving
'Cos now you're not around

Tears will fall
Looking back on life it seems I've done it all
But here am I with my back against a wall
(Can you feel it burning up inside)
An emotion I just don't know how to hide
(Do you think you ever really tried)
If I said I'm not in love you know I lied and

Another night like this
And I'll be heading for the town
Another night like this
And there'll be action going down
Tomorrow night, no more hanging on
It makes no difference now you're gone
Another night and soon I will be leaving
'Cos now you're not around

One more heart attack
You won't be coming back
Any more

Another night like this
And I'll be heading for the town
Another night like this
And there'll be action going down
Tomorrow night, no more hanging on
It makes no difference now you're gone
Another night like this
And I'll be heading for the town
Another night like this
And there'll be action going down
Another night like this
And I'll be heading for the town
Another night like this
And there'll be action going down
Another night
