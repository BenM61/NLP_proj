On and on you keep telling me lies
But what does it take to make your more wise
Take a look at the things we've done
Together we were strong when it all began
When we thought that we could conquer it all
No mountain to high nothing too tall
Why is your fire burning so low
Did you lose all your faith
Did you forget 'bout the dreams that we had
I can't bear your mistakes and that's driving me mad
Nowhere to go and nowhere to hide
Two hearts as one I'm still willing to fight

So do you believe in the force of our love
Why don't you lend me helping hand

Only human, I am only human
Why must you be fooling
Cause I gave you my heart and my soul

Did you expect me to pay all your dues
Why did you gamble whit all we had to lose
Now that we're lost and the sky's closing in
We ruled a game that we couldn't win
Building a castle whit our sweat and our blood
Stone after stone and our clothes stained whit me
Mud
Noting to hard and our forces unite
But we've torn apart and we've killed our light
What about all the dreams that we had
Why did you trade in the good for the bad
Wasn't it worth to take hold of the flame
You turned away but what was your aim

I still believe in the force of our love
Why don't you lend me helping hand

Only human - I am only human
Why must you be fooling
