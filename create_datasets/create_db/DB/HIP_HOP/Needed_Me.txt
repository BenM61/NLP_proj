Mustard on the beat ho!

I was good on my own, that's the way it was
That's the way it was
You was good on the low for a faded f*ck
On some faded love
Shit, what the f*ck you complaining for?
Feeling jaded huh?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to you
Had some fun on the run though I give it to you

But baby
Don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage
F*ck your white horse and a carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it

You needed me
Ooh
You needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby ooh, you needed me

You been rollin' around, shit I'm rollin up
Light and roll it up
Break it down like a pound, shit was never us
Shit was never us
That's the real on the real, are you serious?
How you feel, how you feel?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to ya
Had some fun on the run though, I give it to ya

But baby
Don't get it twisted (don't get it twisted)
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage
F*ck your white horse and a carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it

You needed me
Ooh (ooh)
You needed me (you needed me)
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby ooh, you needed me
