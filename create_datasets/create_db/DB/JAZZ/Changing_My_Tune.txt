Castles were crumbling and daydreams were tumbling
December was battling with June
But on this bright afternoon
Guess I'll be changing my tune
Kept on despairing beyond any caring
If I jumped out of a balloon
But I'm arranging from now
To be changing my tune

At last the stars are bright and shiny
It's a human world once more
Yesterday's troubles are tiny
What was I worried for? 

Wanted a permit to make me a hermit
To grumble and glare at the moon
But I'm arranging from now
To be changing my tune

At last the stars are bright and shiny
It's a human world once more
Yesterday's troubles are tiny
What was I worried for? 

No more resentment, I'm full of contentment
Afloat on a dreamy lagoon
And I'm arranging from now
To be changing my tune
