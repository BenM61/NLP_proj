Well, I got a little red rooster
Too lazy to crow for day
Well, I got a little red rooster
Too lazy to crow for day
Keep everything in the barnyard
Upset in every way

Well, the dogs begin to bark
Hound begin to howl
Well, the dogs begin to bark
Hound begin to howl
Oh, watch out, strange kind people
Little red rooster is on the prowl

Oh, if you see my little red rooster
Please drag him home
Well, if you see my little red rooster
Please drag him home
There no peace in the barnyard
Since the little red rooster been gone

I got a little red rooster
Too lazy to crow for day
Oh, I got a little red rooster
Too lazy to crow for day
Keep everything in the barnyard
Upset in every way
