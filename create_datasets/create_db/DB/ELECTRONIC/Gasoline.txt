Oh well, oh well
I guess you got it all worked out so far
You adjust your reason
Until you see the light from where you are

But you can never win
You can never lose
That's the worst part
You can only say that what you want
Is where you are

You beautiful girl
Won't you listen to me
Well I tried so hard to give you what you need
And it burned like gasoline

Hmm, oh no

Oh well, oh well
It never took a lot to make this hard
'Cause you were so off balance
And I knew all the words to set you off

But you can never win
You can never lose
That's the scorned heart
Then you throw your head back
And you laugh at where we are

You're a beautiful girl
So, won't you listen to me
Well I tried so hard to give you what you need
And it burned like gasoline
Won't you listen to me
Well I tried so hard to give you what you need
And it burned like gasoline, gasoline, oh,
Gasoline, gasoline, oh no no no

You're a beautiful girl
So won't you listen to me
Well I tried so hard to give you what you need
And it burned like gasoline
Won't you listen to me
Well I tried so hard to give you what you need
And it burned like gasoline
Hmm, oh no
Burned like gasoline, oh no
It burned like gasoline
Oh,
