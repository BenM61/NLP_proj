[Chorus]
Rollin, rollin', rollin'
Hey keep rollin', rollin', rollin'
Hey keep rollin', rollin', rollin'
Hey keep rollin', rollin', rollin'

My Impala sittin' on them two fours

My Cutless with them suicide doors

[Swizz Beatz]
Move out my way

[Krayzie Bone]
Here come grandaddy always classin' ain't no nigga badda than that
They know I'm gangsta twenty four on my black Cadillac
And as a matter of fact, flipped it and dipped it in some candy paint
Suckas get mad cause they can't

[Layzie Bone]
Your boy lil' Layzie comin' through all in that black Monte Carlo
I'm swtichin' lanes, givin' lanes like it ain't no tomorrow
I'm a tryna get around cars with no regards for this traffic
Look how I yank it, yeah I yank it makin' it look like it's magic

[Wish Bone]
If you see that dash strong ya know what to do, ya know what to do, ya know what to do
We was fittin' to roll not gon let me roll ?? watchin' for them popos mashin' down that seventy one

[Chorus]

[Wish Bone]
Stomp it bash it with my 350 rocket, Cutless
White on white it's tight from bumper to bumper can't touch this
For a little for juice I supercharge it
Yea his rides tight but ain't tight like mine cause we workin' on different ??

[Krayzie Bone]
I swing my doors open, my doors open
My niggas out in Cleveland swing them doors open, doors open
Big bumps, big bumps big trunks
Try to let off take it to the other side
Lets get high, pimpin' while I'm deep into my vibe

[Layzie Bone]
I'ma come with the cleanest I ain't gon be seen with these niggas don't know who the team is
I love that I breath with Swizz and bone, nigga that's who
We is
Whatever the purpose it's full surface what chu call architects
To hard to check and if you don't move we startin' shit

[Chorus]

[Layzie Bone]
Gotta have it nigga my weapon is automatic nigga
Nigga stepped his game up when he came up should have thought about it nigga
Cause these twenty four inches spinnin' is usually good for makin' they heads twirl
Just try to be nigga when I journey this world

[Krayzie Bone]
Switchin' lanes, pimpin', switchin' lanes, pimpin', switchin' lanes, pimpin', switchin' lanes
We rollin' through your hood like bone thug
And I doubt if we ever need a gangbang it's because

[Chorus]
