Mother nature taught me love
We don't really have to freak 
You just thrill me when you speak 
I can see that your a Star
And I like the way you are 
Funking music lights my Fire
Shakes my body sexified 
Since we both have lots of love 
Send some lovin' up above
Don't give me no added vice
See the love that's in my eyes
All I know is how much I love you Baby
Woo

Watching you over here dancin' on the floor 
It makes me want to love all the more baby
For when we begin
I know my love for you 
will never never end 
Why don't you give me a chance 
To prove my romance
I don't know if I can go on without 
Having you for my own
Oh father above
Give me this lady to love 
So I can love her right now father
All of my love for you to share 
Thank you baby anywhere
I want to love you right now

Funk me if you got the lovin'
Got the desire
Funk me if you got the lovin'
Got the desire
