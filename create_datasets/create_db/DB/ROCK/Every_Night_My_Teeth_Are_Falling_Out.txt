One bad night I'll hold the glass until the glass can hold me down
And one bad night I'll spill and spilling 'till my feet begin to drown
And one bad night I'll hear you calling me to help you not pass out

You and I divide but not devout
Every night my teeth are falling out

Again control of the floor

One dumb night I'll make a point to take an ?
One dumb night I'll take you out to the bar we both blacked out
One dumb night two bad decisions don't divide to cancel out

You and I divorce but not devout
Every night my teeth are falling out
Every night my teeth are falling out
