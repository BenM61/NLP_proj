I don't want to hear it,
No more fussin' and fightin' baby,
Hold me tight.
Let's let bygones be bygones,
Let's think about tomorrow girl,
Our future's bright.
Well, I know I was wrong,
But, I was just a fool,
Too blind to see
You were the only girl for me.
Ah but now I see the light,
And everything's gonna be all right,
Baby, hold me tight.
