I don't care about sunny days
Gonna keep it out of sight but under shade
I'm gonna keep it out of sight but under shade
It's gonna be like this
And that's alright
And that's okay
Is that okay
Myself would beat these lines
In my head I'm getting dead tired of this shit you've caused
You fucking bitch
You don't know when to stop
You're a bunch of fucking fat bitches, fucking fat bitches
Fat bitches

Well I've got myself trapped in the black of your heart
And now I'm gonna f*ck things over 'cos that's a start
Well if I can't have her then no one can

But babe what am I to do
I've given up on loving you
I know it's not nothing new
So please do what I ask of you
And please do what I want you to
It's not fair
Baby blue, it's true
One day I'm gonna have you
But for now I don't care
I still feel the pain
Of you not loving me the same
There's not much I can do
Well I got everyone on my back
I'm not gonna crack like you cracked
You're a fucking pussy boy
Sipping up on my humblepie
You got no legs to keep you anywhere near my hide
So don't try and get near my hide
Well try to keep me up awake
I wanna see what you have to say
I wanna see your lizard state
If that's okay and if that's not okay

Well I don't want to be in the black of your heart
And if I'm gonna make it clear then I'll tear you apart
From the inside to the out

But baby what am I to do
I've given up on loving you
I know it's not nothing new
So please do what I ask you to
And please do what I want with you
It's just not fair
Baby blue and girl it's true
One day I'm gonna have you
But for now I don't care
I still feel the pain
Of you not loving me the same
But girl what was I supposed to do?
Yeah I was so hung up on loving you
And girl believe me this is something new
'Cause all I will do
Is girl whatever I have to do
They all knifed me in the back and girl I can't believe
It's slipping away like that
