People, people, people, 
You know what it means to be left alone 
People, people, people, 
You know what it means to be left alone 
No letter today

Not even a call on my telephone 
Understandin' in a little lovin', 
A little lovin' is all in the world I need 
Understandin' in a little lovin', baby, 
A little lovin' is all in the world I need 
Misunderstandin' in a no good woman, 
They both have caused my heart to bleed 

Every morning, 
The willow weeping moan for me 
Every morning, 
The willow weeping moan for me 
The boy sing me a little song, 
My baby's caused my heart to bleed
