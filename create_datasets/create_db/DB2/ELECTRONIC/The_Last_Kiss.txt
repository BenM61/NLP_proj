There were times all along that I thought I was catching on
Now I see it was only time catching up with me.
As you stand at the door I know Ibe never wanted you more
There's just one thing before you turn and you walk out on me

If this is the last kiss
If this is the last touch

If this is the last time I can ever be holding you.
If this is the last race
I can never forget your face

If this is the last kiss Ill get used to it
I'll get through this somehow someway.

I won't stand in your way
I won't even begin to say
That you never looked better
Never looked so good to me
Though I've asked this before
I won't ever ask anything more
Just close your eyes and please
Do this for me.
And if this is the last kiss
If this is the last touch...

If you've ever been a lover she's got what you're looking for.
So don't surrender
'Cause you might discover
That somebody

Somewhere is waiting for you to remember the last kiss.
Just remember the last touch
Remember the last time

I can ever be holding you.
Just remember the last race
I can never forget your face

If this is the last kiss
Can't get used to it

Ill get used to it
Nohow
No
Noway.
Never get used to it
Never get used to it

Never get used to it
Never get used to it
Noway.
