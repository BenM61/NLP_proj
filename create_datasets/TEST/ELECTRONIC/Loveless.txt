Here comes the eyes again sad
Like something wasn't enough
Oh, did you say that you had it
The drunken handcuffs

Keep pulling me 'round
It feels like they're fraying
But, you'll hold your ground

Did we really lose our hearts
Did we really lose our hearts
Did we really lose our hearts
Did we really lose our hearts

But, tell me: When do you tire?
Of being right all the time
Oh, don't stop now
You're on fire

Oh, did I just cross the line
Oh, did I ruin the show
The show that keep us alive
But, tell me
Don't it feel hollow
When you have nothing inside

Did we really lose our hearts
Did we really lose our hearts
Did we really lose our hearts
Did we really lose our hearts

Did we really lose our hearts
Did we really lose our hearts
Did we really lose our hearts
Did we really lose our hearts

Did we really lose our hearts
Did we really lose our hearts
Did we really lose our hearts
Did we really lose our hearts
