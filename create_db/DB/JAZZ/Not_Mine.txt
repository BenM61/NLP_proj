It's somebody else's moon above, not mine
It's somebody else's night for love, not mine
A heart to someone else is a thing that melts
To me it's just a comic Valentine

Let somebody else's tear be shed, not mine
Let somebody else's nose get red, not mine

I like playing solitaire
But until I can draw a pair
It's somebody else's moon up there, not mine
