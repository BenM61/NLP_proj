Oh velocity girl
What makes you go so fast
Is it the speed you're taking
Since you gave up the drinking
Oh velocity girl

I can't keep up with you
Can't stand to be alone
Think you should be with me
Just want to stay here in your arms
Oh velocity girl

Try harder to stay put
Understand me when I say
Please don't leave today
Oh velocity girl

I don't know what I'm thinking
Since I gave up the drinking
Please just stay with me
Just want to stay here in your arms
Oh velocity girl

Can I though your hand
Can I move it here
Don't you understand?

Just want to stay here in your arms
Just want to stay here in your arms
Just want to stay here in your arms
Just want to stay here in your arms
