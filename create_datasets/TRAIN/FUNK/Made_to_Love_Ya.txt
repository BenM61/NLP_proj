I recall when we first met, a long time ago
How could I forget they way I felt
When I first laid eyes on you

I remember saying to my friends
There is my future wife and then
I took the step to need
Someone who would change my life

It had to be my destiny
'Cause I was made to love you
My hands, to touch you
My arms, to hold ya, my legs to stand

My time, to spend with ya forever
I was made, made to love ya
My lips to kiss ya
My eyes to see you, my legs to stand

My time, to spend with you forever
My life, together I was made
Made to love you
Made to love you

I remember out first date
Our first arguments
Our very first breakup
And makeup that got us to this moment

And every girlfriend and every one night stand
Every heartbreak and every heartache led me to you
It brought me to and made me better
Better, sooner for you
It had to be my destiny

I was made to love ya
My hands, to touch ya
My arms, to hold ya
My legs, to stand

My time, to spend with you forever
I was made, made to love you
My lips, to kiss you
My eyes, to see you, my legs to stand

My time, to spend with you forever
My life, together 
I was made, made to love you
Made to love you

Made to love you
My hands, to touch ya
My arms, to hold ya
My legs, to stand
My time, to spend with ya forever
I was made, made to love you

My lips to kiss ya
My eyes to see you my legs to stand

My time, to spend with you forever
My life, together 
I was made, made to love you

It had to be my destiny
I was made to love you
My hands to touch ya
My arms to hold ya
My legs to stand
My time to spend with you forever
I was made, made to love you

My lips to kiss ya
My eyes to see you 
My legs to stand
My time to spend
With you forever
My life together
I was made, made to love you

Made to love you
My hands to touch ya
My arms to hold ya
My legs to stand
My time to spend with you forever
I was made, made to love you

My lips to kiss ya
My eyes to see you 
My legs to stand
My time to spend
With you forever
My life together
I was made, made to love you

Made to love you
My hands to touch ya
My arms to hold ya
My legs to stand
And my time to spend with you forever
I was made, made to love you
