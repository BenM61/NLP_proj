I never been so worried
So bothered in my life befo'
I never been so worried
So bothered in my life befo'
And if I just make it over
I won't be back, no mo'

My grouchy hearted, mama
She's evil as a gal can be
Oh yeah, now, my grouchy hearted, mama
She's evil as a gal can be
The more I try to love 'er
The less she seem to care for me

I don't mind her laughin'
I love to see her have her fun
I don't mind her laughin'
I love to see her have her fun
But when it come to loving
I don't want her to give 'way none

Oh, play it Mr. so and so
You know what I'm talkin' bout

Oh yes, drink up another pint there, ladies and gentlemen
I'm 'on get drunk and pitch me, a play a boogie woogie
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
I ain't gon' cheat nobody, though
Remember, if you always be a good fella
You'll die one, that right, oh yeah

Now, my grouchy hearted, mama
Got somethin' like a sting a ree
Do you know what I'm talkin' about?
Ha, ha

Now, my grouchy hearted, mama
Got somethin' like a sting a ree
You know it's tough man, too
I believe to my soul, she done put that thing on me

Now, she's little, low an squatty
She's built right down on the ground
(A little cute devil)

She's little, low an squatty
She's built right down on the ground
Ev'rytime she kiss me
My love come tumblin' down
Can't help it none
