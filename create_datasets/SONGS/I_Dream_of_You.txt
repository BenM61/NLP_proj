INTRO:
You're completely unaware, dear, that my heart is in your hand
So for love's sake won't you listen and try to understand?

I dream of you more than you dream I do
How can I prove to you this love is real?
You mean to me more than you mean to be
You just can't seem to see the way I feel

	When I am close to you the world is far away
	The words that fill my heart my lips can't seem to say

I want you so more than you'll ever know
More than you dream I do, I dream of you

I want you so more than you'll ever know
More than you dream I do,         I    dream    of you
