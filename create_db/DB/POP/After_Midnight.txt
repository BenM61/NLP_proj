Love me when the night is young
You should know it won't be long
'Cause baby when the midnight comes
Yeah, I'll be long gone

Take my hand and baby hold me tight
Fairy tale romance
We've only got tonight
Hold me close, it makes me feel alive
Makes me feel alive
Makes me feel alive

I can't
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you after midnight

I can't
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you after midnight

Love me when the night is young

Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
