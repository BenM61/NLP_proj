there are things that i regret
like being called a nervous wreck
and working up another sweat for you
there's nothing that i can do
for counterparts and bleeding hearts
and all the things that fall apart for you
i don't keep my secrets there
i hide them everywhere 
i could deny
but i'll never realise
i'm just chasing rainbows
all the time
i could deny
but i'll never realise
i've been chasing rainbows
all my life 

and then i missed my cue
everybody had a laugh
and then went for an early bath
did you 
i don't keep my secrets there
i hide them everywhere
