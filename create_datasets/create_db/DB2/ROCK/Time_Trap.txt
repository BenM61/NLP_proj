It's barely yours on loan
What you think you own
The place that you call home
The ideas in your bones
In your bones

This would still feel dumb
Back where you're from
Do you
Do you want to change your mind?
Do you want to change your mind?

'Cause you could never know that
In a time trap
In a time trap

Guess that's all fair
Now because
Guess that's all there
Ever was
Grey and sprawling
Save your crawling

'Cause you could never know that
In a time trap
In a time trap

Do you want to save your life?
Do you want to save your life?

'Cause you could never know that
In a time trap
In a time trap
