Boys there how many boyz there?
How many?

How many tequilas in the place
How many beers are in the case?

How many dutty wine swing it away
How many shots without the case?

Boys there?

How many mash up and in a haze
How many wacky dip fall the head

Boys there?

How many no money boys are crazy (2x)
How many boyz are raw
How many no money boyz are rowdy
How many start a war

Hey now

Can we go ridin' up a dirty track up in Laventille
Will you, show me before I make it back somewhere I can chill?

Hey now

Cooking chicken on the wall with the system up on full
