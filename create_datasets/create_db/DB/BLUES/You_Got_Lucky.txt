You better watch what you say,
You better watch what you do to me.
Don't get carried away,
Girl, if you can do better than me, then go
Yeah go, but remember

Good love is hard to find,
Good love is hard to find.
You got lucky, baby
You got lucky, babe
When I found you.

You put your hand on my cheek
And then you turn your eyes away.
If you don't make you complete
If I don't take you all the way, then go
Yeah go, but remember

Good love is hard to find,
Good love is hard to find.
You got lucky, baby
You got lucky, babe
When I found you.

Oh, then go, yeah, go.
But remember

Good love is hard to find,
Good love is hard to find.
You got lucky, baby
You got lucky, babe
When I found you.
