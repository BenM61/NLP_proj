Boy, listen
Everybody can't be in my head
Everybody can't sleep in my bed
Everybody can't be up in my face
Everybody can't be all in my space

Now I might fuss a lil' bit, curse a lil' bit
You know this, yeah
But if you trust a lil' bit
You gonna get one hundred percent

I don't want nobody but you
Don't want nobody touching me, baby
But you
Don't want nobody kissing me, baby
But you
Don't want nobody loving me, baby
But you
But you, you, you

Everybody won't understand my journey
Everybody won't know how it heal what hurts me
Everybody can't be written into my story
Just because they want me don't mean they ready for me

Now I might throw a lil' fit, talk a lil' slick
I do this, yeah
I'm willing to go on and admit it that you a perfect fit
Baby, you the shit

I don't want nobody but you
Don't want nobody touching me, baby
But you
Don't want nobody kissing me, baby
But you
Don't want nobody loving me, baby
But you
But you, you, you

Never mind what you thought, you were in my heart
Never mind what you think, you were in my dreams
Never mind how it seems, you're my everything
Never mind

I don't want nobody but you
Don't want nobody touching me, baby
But you
Don't want nobody kissing me, baby
But you
Don't want nobody loving me, baby
But you
But you, you, you
I don't want nobody but you
