Could it be magic
Could it be fantasy
Maybe I'm dreamin'
Cause it sure seems too good to me
Say that you want me
Say there ain't no one else
Makin' no promises
Cause we both know only time will tell
If this is real or just a moment in time

We got such a good thang
Ain't nothin' comin' close to this high
Doesn't get any better in this life

We got such a good thang
Our bodies just melt into one
When we're lovin' each other it feels so right

From the beginning it's like I could read your mind
I knew what you were thinkin'
When I looked into your eyes
You gave me that feelin'
That's keeping me warm inside
And I would be happy
To stay by your side
Cause we got something
That's just so hard to find

Come with me
All the signs say this was meant to be
Sometimes love is such a mystery
But it seems clear to me

We got such a good thang
Ain't nothin' comin' close to this high
Doesn't get any better in this life

We got such a good thang
Our bodies just melt into one
When we're lovin' each other it feels so right
