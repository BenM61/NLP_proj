Electrify me you my half baked youth
I memorise your face so I won't forget you
Dancing demons in the firelight yes it's true
Remind me of the night I first met you
Criticise me for my mis-spent youth
No thrill no lie more crazy than the truth
You give me precious things I throw them all away
And now you free my breath your scared what I might say

Speak no lie, I tell the truth
Save my breath you break the rules
Time will tell yeah who is who
Side by side we're bullitproof
