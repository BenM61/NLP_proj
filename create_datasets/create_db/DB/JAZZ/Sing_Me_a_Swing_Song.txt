Give me a song that's robust
Feeling the way I am
Any old band'll go bust
If it ain't got that jam

When a body needs a body
On the ballroom floor
Then a body asks a body
"What's a swing band for?"

Oh baby, I don't want you
To croon soft and mellow
Let me warn you in advance
Sing me a swing song and let me dance

Oh baby, I don't want
Any moon, bright and yellow
You can have your sweet romance
Sing me a swing song and let me dance

Mr. Trombone, play some corn
I ain't carin' what notes
Mr. Trumpet, grab a horn
Brother, give me hot notes

Oh baby, I don't want
Any tune on a cello
Give the rhythm men a chance
Sing me a swing song and let me dance

Let me warn you in advance
Sing me a swing song and let me dance
You can have your sweet romance, just
Sing me a swing song and let me dance

Mr. Trombone, play some corn
I ain't carin' what notes
Mr. Trumpet, grab a horn
Brother, give me hot notes

Oh baby, I don't want
Any tune on a cello
Give the rhythm men a chance
Sing me a swing song and let me dance

Ol' Chick Webb is beatin' it out
Makes me feel like I want to shout
All the boys are ready to prance, so
Sing me a swing song and let me dance
