I won't spend my life 
Waiting for an angel to descend 
Searching for a rainbow with an end 
Now that I've found you I'll call off the search 
And I won't spend my life 
Gazing at the stars up in the sky 
Wondering if love will pass me by 
Now that I've found you I'll call off the search 

Out on my own 
I would never have known this world 
That I see today 
And I've got a feeling 
It won't fade away 

And I won't end my days 
Wishing that love would come along 
Because you are in my life where you belong 
Now that I've found you I'll call off the search 

Now that I've found you I'll call off the search [x2]
