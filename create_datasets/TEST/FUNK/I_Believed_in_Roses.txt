Because you're so good-looking
The walk you had was cooking
It just took one look, I was on my knees
Was I just a fool then to fall right into your den ?
Residues of the same old dance
I believed in roses
Stereotyped romances
I was Cinderella in my dreams
Like Svengali has power, like a bee needs a flower
You were like a drug to me
Holding you too close to make you stay
Wrap my arms all around you, babe
Maybe too tight, so you'll fight, squeezing you
Holding you too close to make you stay
Wrap my arms all around you, babe
It's just a game we like to play
It's just a game we like to play
We always get what we choose
If we win we may lose
Just a mirror of our vanities
I've got to give you your due, you ran so fast I chased you
A healthy game of cat and mouse
I know it's crazy, but it's me
Wrap my arms all around you, babe
Maybe too tight, so you'll fight, squeezing you
Holding you too close to make you run
Wrap my arms all around you, babe
It's just a game we like to play
It's just a game we like to play
