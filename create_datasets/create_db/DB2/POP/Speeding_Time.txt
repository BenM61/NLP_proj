Decades pass in just one year
And your illusions disappear
And you fear the speeding time

You find a dream that you embrace
Look the other way and it's a race
Trying to keep pace with the speeding time

Don't see no more dancin' on the street
And its not easy to laugh at your defeat

But hang in--hold on
There will be relief 
why'gotta try, gotta try to keep your love alive 
In this speeding time

Get your feet on solid ground
It's a nightmare you have found
The howling sound of speeding time
why'hear the cries behind stone walls
Decipher echoes down the halls
But don't you fall in the speeding time

Drifting back is no way to begin
why'gotta try to find the strength within

And hang in--hold on
There will be relief
why'gotta try, gotta try to keep your love alive
In this speeding time

You never listened when the prophets said
Prepare yourself for times that lie ahead
Now that you know they didn't speak a lie
There's nothing for you to do except to try

And hang in--hold on
Oh, hang in--hold on
There will be relief
why'gotta try, gotta try to keep your love alive
In this speeding time
