We are
I've come apart and you made me
Float like
A pretty box of your evil
So tired
So easy I

Bleed out
What the f*ck were you thinking
We are
Gonna fall if you lead us
Nowhere
No wasted time

I'll be a thorn in your side
Till you die
I'll be a thorn in your side
For always
If we sink
We lift our love

I'll be a thorn in your side
Till you die
I'll be a thorn in your side
For always
If we sink
We lift our love

We are
Let me stop for a second
Held heart
Only beats in the evening
Low tide
Watching for flight

I tell you
To cut it out if you make me
You know why
The slowest spark is a breather
How high
How will you decide

I'll be a thorn in your side
Till you die
I'll be a thorn in your side
For always
If we sink
We lift our love

I'll be a thorn in your side
Till you die
I'll be a thorn in your side
For always
If we sink
We lift our love

So low
You keep stalling
Can you not see why?

Say, say, say

Love was

Say, say, say

That you see cry

A simple call seems right
And I know why

I'll be a thorn in your side
Till you die
I'll be a thorn in your side
For always
If we sink
We lift our love

I'll be a thorn in your side
Till you die
I'll be a thorn in your side
For always
If we sink
We lift our love
