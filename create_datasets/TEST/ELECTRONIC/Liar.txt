I want to hold you to the sun
I want to be your faithful one
I want to show you all the beauty
You don't even know you hold
I'm hurting you for your own good
I'd die for you, you know I would
I'd give up all my wealth
To buy you back the soul you never sold

I want to mix our blood
And put it in the ground
So you can never leave
I want to earn your trust
Your faith, your heart
You'll never be deceived

Liar, liar, liar, liar
Liar, liar, liar, liar
Liar, liar, liar, liar
Liar, liar, liar, liar
Liar
Liar

I want to heal you pretty sweet
I'll throw rose petals at your feet
I'll spend eternity
Comparing all my poetry to yours
I want to see love through your eyes
You'll never have to compromise
I'd give up all my fame
To fight your demons and your bloody wars

I want to mix our blood
And put it in the ground
So you can never leave
I want to earn your trust
Your faith, your heart
You'll never be deceived

Liar, liar, liar, liar
Liar, liar, liar, liar
Liar, liar, liar, liar
Liar, liar, liar, liar
