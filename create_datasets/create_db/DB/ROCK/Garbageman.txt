You ain't no punk, you punk
You wanna talk about the real junk? 
If I ever slip, I'll be banned 'cause I'm your garbageman
Well you can't dig me you can't dig nothin'
Do you want the real thing, or are you just talkin'? 
Do you understand? I'm your garbageman
Yeah, somethin' from the garage and down the driveway
Now get outta your mind and get outta my way
Now do you understand? do you understand? 

Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie the bird's the word and do you know why? 
You gotta beat it with a stick
You gotta beat it 'til it's thick
You gotta live until you're dead
You gotta rock 'til you see red

Now do you understand? 
Do you understand? 
I'm a garbageman. aw, jump on and ride
Yeah it's just what you need when you're down in the dumps
One half hillbilly and one half punk
Big long legs and one big mouth
The hottest thing from the north to come out of the south 
Do you understand? do you understand? 
Woo, I can't lose with the stuff I use
And you don't choose no substitutes 
So stick out your can 'cause I'm your garbageman

Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie the bird's the word and do you know why?

You gotta beat it with a stick
You gotta beat it 'til it's thick 
You gotta live until you're dead
You gotta rock 'til you see red

Now do you understand?
Do you understand?
Do you understand?
All right, hop off
