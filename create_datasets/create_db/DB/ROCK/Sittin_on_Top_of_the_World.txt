Worked all summer and all the fall
Had to take my Christmas in overalls
Now, she's gone and I don't worry
I'm sittin' on top of the world

When I had you baby, you wouldn't treat me right
You stayed away both day and night
Now, she's gone and I don't worry
I'm sittin' on top of the world

It's been days when I didn't know your name
Why should I cry, cry in vain?
Now, she's gone and I don't worry
I'm sittin' on top of the world
