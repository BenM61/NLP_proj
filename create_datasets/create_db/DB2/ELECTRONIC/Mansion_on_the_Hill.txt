Hit the dance round about midnight
Gin n juice and he's a feelin' fine
Come morning all the signs went up
Policeman said the joint was shut
All the brothers gettin' busted outside
Undercover officer readin' em their rights
One way ticket boy your prison bound
The night the lights in Dallas went down so

How long we gonna wait until
We get the keys to the mansion on the hill
I want to know right now
How long we gonna waste our time
Boarding a bus that's bound for the welfare line
I want to know right now

Shakes the blues off and she tries her luck
Makes a little bet hopes the horse comes up
Picks your pockets for some easy money
'Cause she blew the goddamn lot on the national lottery
Steals the paper and checks the front page
Headlines read the dancehall can't be saved
How can the open up the opera house
On the night the lights in Dallas went down

How long we gonna wait until
We get the keys to the mansion on the hill
I want to know right now
How long we gonna waste our time
Boarding a bus that's bound for the welfare line
I want to know right now

Tweak freak Tony on the 4 2 8
Special branch sting right time wrong place
Colombian connections in the corridors of power
Mean the man on the money ain't ever goin' down
Lord Lucky takes his lady to the magic flute
A little taste of heat and now he's bullet proof
Tony tunes to underground radio
On the night the lights in Dallas went down

How long we gonna wait until
We get the keys to the mansion on the hill
I want to know right now
How long we gonna waste our time
Boarding a bus that's boud for the welfare line
I want to know right now
