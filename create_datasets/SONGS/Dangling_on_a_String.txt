You've got me dangling on a string
Please don't let me drop, my life will surely stop
'Cause I'm trapped in a dream of needing you so
My heart's in a noose and I can't break loose

I'm not half the man that I used to be, and I'll admit it
Your love has become a habit to me, and I can't quit it
Won't you take this half a man and make this man whole again?

You've got me dangling on a string
Please don't let me drop, 'cause you're everything I've got
'Cause I'm trapped in a dream of needing you so
The feeling is strong and I can't let go

Every time I phone, your number's changed or disconnected
You have made my life a book of games, I feel so rejected
Girl, you've got the best of me, now come and take the rest of me

You've got me dangling on a string
Please don't let me drop, 'cause you're everything I've got
'Cause I'm trapped in a dream of needing you so
The feeling is strong and I can't let go

Girl, my nights are so lonely
Ooh, I'm needing you only

I only drink enough from your loving cup to keep me thirsty
Girl, my need for you is, oh so strong, until it hurts me

You've got me dangling on a string
Please don't let me drop, 'cause you're everything I've got
'Cause I'm trapped in a dream of needing you so
The feeling is strong and I can't let go

You've got me dangling on a string
