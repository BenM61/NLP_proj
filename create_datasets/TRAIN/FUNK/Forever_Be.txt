How people hold their breath
Keep it in, waitin' for a sign
Can't let it out till none is left
And night comes on and the moon is high

We are here, you and I, just in time,
To tell a fire tell a secret, here's mine
I was scared, terrified, of the lines
That I might forget to sing to you tonight

There will never be another day for us to be purpose
I'll follow your lead, together, and we'll forever be
We'll forever be

How people lose their step
Tryna find their way in troubled times
Holding on till promise's kept
Let's go down, and my heart is blind

We are here, you and I, just in time,
To tell a fire tell a secret, here's mine
I was scared, terrified, of the lines
That I might forget to sing to you tonight

There will never be another day for us to be purpose
I'll follow your lead, together, and we'll forever be
We'll forever be
There will never be another day for us to be purpose
I'll follow your lead, together, and we'll forever be
We'll forever be
There will never be another day for us to be purpose
I'll follow your lead, together, and we'll forever be
We'll forever be
