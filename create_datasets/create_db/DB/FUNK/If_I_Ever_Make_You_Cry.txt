If I ever make you cry
All through my life may my eyes never smile again
If I ever make you cry
All through my life may my lips never laugh again

And if you should find that I have been untrue
May I never spend a happy day
And may I never hear somebody say

A tender word like, I love you
A tender voice like, I need you
I make a vow, right here and now
That I will live to love you

If I ever make you cry
Long as I live, may the world turn away from me
If I ever make you cry, even once
Long as I live, may my dreams never come to be

And if I should ever, ever break your heart
May I never see the sun appear
And may I go through life and never hear

A tender voice say, I love you
Your precious voice say, I need you
Come to my arms, my waiting arms
And softly say, you love me
