You had the office before you had the business
You had the ring before you found the girl
If it were up to you would she be suffering still?
You say your arms ache from the weight of your mistakes
You're the keeper of the doomsday clock
Did I get that wrong?

Little darling, I try
Oh at least I look on the bright side
I'll break it to you gently
Break it to you gently

With their 45s from 82 and the looks that say
I'm cooler than you
They hide behind boxing fists and arrogance
I got nothing, nothing, nothing to say
About the way you spend your day
You rest your head on your hands.
would you let it slip away?

Little darling, I try
Oh at least I look on the bright side
I'll break it to you gently
Break it to you gently
Little darling I try
Oh at least I look on the bright side
I'll break it to you gently
Break it to you gently

Little darling, I try
Oh at least I look on the bright side
I'll break it to you gently
Break it to you gently
Little darling, I try
Oh at least I look on the bright side
I'll break it to you gently
Break it to you gently

I'll Break it to you gently
