I'm in the mood for a melody
I'm in the mood for a melody I'm in the mood

I'm in the mood for a melody
I'm in the mood for a melody I'm in the mood

I'm in the mood for a melody
I'm in the mood for a melody I'm in the mood

I can make you dance I can make you sing
I can make you dance I can make you sing
If you want me to

Oh I can make you dance I can make you sing
I can make you dance I can make you sing
If you want me to

Oh I can make you dance I can make you sing
I can make you dance I can make you sing if you want me to

And your little song that you want to sing
A little song that you want to sing sung in lieu

Here's a little song that you want to sing
A little song that you want to sing some of you

A little song that you want to sing
A little song that you want to sing happy or blue

I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood

Why'd I end up doing it doin' it doing it
Do anything that you want me for if you want me to

Do it right gonna do it right
Cause a matter of fact it'll turn out to be strong
If you want me to if you want me to
Oh if you want me to if you want me to if you want me to
