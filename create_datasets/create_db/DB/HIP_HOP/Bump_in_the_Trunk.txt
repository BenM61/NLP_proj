Bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone
In the trunk, in the trunk, yeah, yeah
In the trunk, in the trunk
In the trunk, in the trunk, Bone Thugs, Bone Thugs
In the trunk, in the trunk, Bone Thugs, Swizz Beatz

[Chorus:]
Ya feelin' the wrath of the rump then bump in ya trunk
Ya feelin' the wrath of the rump then bump in ya trunk
Ya feelin' the wrath of the rump then bump in ya trunk
In the trunk, in the trunk, in the trunk, in the trunk
Ya feelin the wrath of the rump then bump in ya trunk
Ya feelin' the wrath of the rump then bump in ya trunk

[Layzie Bone]
Nigga feel the beat in ya chest when ya leanin' 'n swervin'
Bass in ya back, you feel it, you heard it
Hand on the wheel no need to be nervous
Ride
With a g everything'll be perfect
Put it down, put it all on the surface
Dirty as we ride, it'll all be worth it
('Til the wheels fall off) Nigga
That's the purpose
Nothin' but the best 'cause we deserve it
They know when I'm comin, cause niggas can hear me before they can see me and they can't
Believe it cause I'm bumpin Eazy-E
And they just seen me on TV
Navigate through the streets dog
Keep it real to the beat that ain't no secret
Jump
Outta the jeep car
Run up in the liquor store hit the freezer
Grab a O, Gold, like my 4-0, my flow so cold, I gotta have some
Turn the music back up
To the maximum
Them niggas hatin on us but I laugh at 'em
I gotta 9 millimeter that I'll get me to the trunk
If I make it to the trunk
I'm a pop
That trunk
Y'all already know comin' outta the trunk is a AK who? 
With a 12 gauge what?

[Chorus]

[Krayzie Bone]

We back with a vengeance 'cause rap took a strippin' without us
Let's be honest, this industry's now over crowded, forgot us
Nigga ya time up
Go back
To practice sign with your life and sign up
If niggas is lookin' for hits hit Swizz up, nigga he comin' to find us
And we ain't hard to find
Been
Right here all the time
That bling got y'all all blind
These niggas ain't raw as I
So don't make me kill ya
Don't try to battle me cause ain't none
Of you niggas skilled enough (skilled enough)
I'm sick of these niggas, they killin' me, really they wanna be thugs
Everybody wanna roll like us, smoke
Blunts
Cause we pump off in your trunk
Them niggas get hypnotized
Run up as soon as they feel the vibe
They never been on a realer ride
Just
Runnin' up, let's turn it up till they know

[Chorus]

[Wish Bone]

'fore the liquor store close in a rush turn it up, let it drop, now nigga let's roll, roll
Gotta fill up
With a drink of
Anything thing that bang
Or roll up
Gotta choose what I listen too
Cause it ain't got much that I'm feelin' ooh
Everybody talkin' violence
Take a life live they been through

I love that gangsta music
Bump nothin' but thugsta music
Except when I lay down and slow down, that lovin' music
No pretender get in ya
Thugs
Runnin' through it
The truest
We still hear they love how we do it, we do it
Thugsta
Outta line cross mine
Yes thugstas really rush ya

Bang ya brains with thangs
Never run away
Any day I'm here to stay we love to play
Bone got that feel good pop it in listen to real rappin'

[Chorus]
