I want to thank the storm that brought the snow (uh uh)
Thanks to the string of lights that make it glow (uh)
But I wanna thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas

It barely took a breath to realize
We're gonna be a classic for all time
I wanna thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas

Sweet gingerbread made with molasses
My heart skipped and I reacted
Can't believe that this is happening
Like a present sent from God
Sleigh bells singing hallelujah
Stars are shining on us, too

I wanna thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas

Thought I was done for, thought that love had died
But you came along I swear you saved my life
And I wanna thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas

Sweet gingerbread made with molasses
My heart skipped and I reacted
Can't believe that this is happening
Like a present sent from God
Sleigh bells singing hallelujah
Stars are shining on us, too

I wanna thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas

I never thought I'd find a love like this
But I found forever in that very first kiss
I wanna thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas
Oh oh (oh thank you baby)

I wanna thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas
