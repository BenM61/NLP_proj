I'm waking up, thinking how we used to be
I still hang on to our tired dreams
I wish we could turn back the hands of time
Replace the poison that you left onto my mind

Maybe we'll meet again in another life
Maybe we're better in another paradise
Maybe we will meet again
Maybe we will fall again

In another life
In another life

I can't imagine what this life would be
We holdin' on to fading memories
I love you, you love me, but this love sets you free
But if you choose to leave well I hope we meet

Maybe we'll meet again in another life
Maybe we're better in another paradise
Maybe we will meet again
Maybe we will fall again

In another life

Maybe we'll meet again in another life
Maybe we're better in another paradise
Maybe we will meet again
Maybe we will fall again

In another life
In another life
