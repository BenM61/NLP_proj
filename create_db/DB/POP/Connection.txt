These days my waves get lost in the oceans
Seven billion swimmers, man I'm going through the motions
Sent up a flare, I need love and devotion
Traded for some faces that I never know, notion
Maybe I should try to find the old me
Take me to the places and the people that know me
Tryin' to disconnect, thinking maybe you could show me
If there's so many people here, then why am I so lonely?

Can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?
Can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?

Real friends, good friends, hard to find, let's face it
Find the perfect tone and there's a flood in the basement
Made a couple dollars now and I ain't tryin' to chase it
Kids from Oklahoma, man we don't waste it
I'm just tryin' to paint the picture for me
Something I could give a damn about at maybe 40
Years and I be ready and willing and able to edit the story
'Cause there's so many people here to be so damn lonely

Can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?
Can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?
I can see it in my, see it in my reflection
Oh, can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?

Lonely

Right now, right now, I'm switching to a new lane
Foot to the floor, man searching for the real thing
Meet somebody else, sometimes ain't no shame
Head to the clouds sayin'

It's like can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?
Can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?
I can see it in my, see it in my reflection
Oh, can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?

Try'na find the old me
Lonely
