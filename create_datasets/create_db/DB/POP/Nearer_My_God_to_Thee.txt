Nearer, my god to thee,
Nearer to thee,
Even though it be a cross,
That raiseth me

Still, all my song shall be,
Nearer, my god to thee,
Nearer, my god to thee,
Nearer to thee

Though like the wanderer,
The sun gone down,
Darkness be over me,
My rest a stone

Yet in my dreams I'll be,
Nearer, my god to thee,
Nearer, my god to thee,
Nearer to thee

There let the way appear,
Steps unto heaven,
All that thou sendest me,
In mercy given!

Angels to beckon me,
Nearer, my god to thee,
Nearer, my god to thee,
Nearer to thee
