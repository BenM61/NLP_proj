I know you met someone last night,
See it in your eyes,
You said we only talked alright, now that's a big lie
And I know it's all over now, I guess we lost our love somehow
The moment you left through that door,
No, you never come back here no more

You came and took your things today,
Gave me your ring back,
I never thought it'd end this way,
Fell in your love trap,
And I know it's over now, I guess we lost our love somehow.
The moment you left through that door,
No you never come back here no more

You said you're never comin' back home,
You got me chokin',
Now that's a typical syndrome when heart gets broken,
Oh broken oh yeah
'Cause I know it's all over now, I guess we lost our love somehow,
The moment you left through that door,
No you never come back here no more
'Cause it's all over now
We lost our love somehow
You left through that door and I know
You'll never come back here no more
'Cause it's all over now, it's all over now
