I see you and I know you see me
We walk by
Our paths never meet
Seems so clear I'm the invisible freak
You keep your side of the street

Sister not alone face in the crowd
See me laughing but I'm shopping around
Oh my heart is what you wanted to be
All these lies your giving me

Are you so different to me
I know you cant possible be
Were two in a million
But you could be someone that makes my perception complete

We go by our separate lives
Living out our separate lies
Only we got the space in-between
How beautiful it could be
How beautiful it could be

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Oh so busy trying to get everyday
Don't even see the people crossing the edge
Lie lie lie after,
And baby we just turn our heads

Now are you so different to me
I know you cant possible be
Were two in a million
But you could be someone that makes my perception complete

We go by our parallel lives
Living out our separate lies
Only we got the space in-between
How beautiful it could be
How beautiful it could be

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Just imagine if our lives came together
For a moment it'll work and its no stranger
Make a difference ever together
No more distance between all these parallel lines

No more distance between all these parallel lines
No more persistence between all these parallel lines

Now are you so different to me
I know you cant possible be
Were two in a million
But you could be someone that makes my perception complete

We go by our parallel lives
Living out our separate lies
Only we got the space in-between
How beautiful it could be
How beautiful it could be
