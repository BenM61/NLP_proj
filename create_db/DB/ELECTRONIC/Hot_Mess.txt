You're a hot mess
You act like you've got nothing to lose
But I've already lost my temper

I put my loving on the line for you, lady
But my spirits were low
I would have committed a crime for you, baby
Yeah, it got out of control

I know my temper's been kinda crazy
I need somebody, (What) I need someone
Your love is real but I just feel suffocated
I feel so lonely, (What) I feel so numb

I thought we had this conversation already
Do you really want to go through this all over again

The way I was acting was just fine but then lately
You sorta noticed a shift
Every day was Christmas time for you, lady
You got showered with gifts

But you could hear it in my voice
I was getting kind of aloof
And I don't really have a choice
I guess I gotta tell you the truth

I know my temper's been kinda crazy
I need somebody, (What) I need someone
Your love is real but I just feel suffocated
I feel so lonely, (What) I feel so numb

I don't what you want from me
I mean, I'm not a bloody social worker

I know my temper's been kinda crazy
I need somebody, (What) I need someone
Your love is real but I just feel suffocated
I feel so lonely, (What) I feel so numb

What?

I need somebody, I need someone
I feel so lonely, I feel so numb
