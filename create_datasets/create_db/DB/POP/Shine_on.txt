Giving every moment I had
Still I can never seem to keep up with you
You're done with one mile and onto another one thousand
Still I can never seem to keep up with you

I know you'll be better off without me when I'm gone
You know you're beautiful, you're beautiful
Shine on
You were made to
Shine on
And you know I love you
And even if we can or can't be friends,
I'll be with you until the very end
So shine on
You were made to

It's keeping me awake every night
But I can never seem to give up on you
I send up a prayer, then I'm onto another one thousand
But I can never seem to give up on you

I know you'll be better off without me when I'm gone
You know you're beautiful, you're beautiful
Shine on
You were made to
Shine on
And you know I love you
And even if we can or can't be friends,
I'll be with you until the very end
So shine on
Yeah

Nobody's wrong
Nobody's right
Keep moving on

Shine on
Yeah
You were made to
Shine on

Shine on
You were made to
Shine on
And you know I love you
And even if we can or can't be friends,
You're gonna be brighter than you've ever been
So shine on

You're gonna be just fine
Ooh, you're gonna be all right, love
You're gonna be just fine
Ooh, you're gonna be all right, love
