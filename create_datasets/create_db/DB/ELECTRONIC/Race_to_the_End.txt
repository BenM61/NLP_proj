There is but one freedom
Man running along
Each step that he's taking
A step to his soul
The passion and courage
It takes to be there
The spirit of freedom
Alive in the air

Whenever the running man awakes
To chalenge to glory
He knows he can turn the key once more
To unlock the soul

The way becomes clearer The way is complete
The need, that of winning
Admit no defeat
The circles together
Hold hands to the sky
The freedom of running
The freedom to fly

Let no man surround himself with pain
But use it to free him
The game is to learn to live again
To try to the end
A race to the end
