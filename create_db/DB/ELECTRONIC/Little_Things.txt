I put my head on my shoulders
Try to be someone, yeah
I tilt my person three degrees
To try to get along, yeah
It's so uncomfortable trying
To fit into this skin, yeah
I put my head on my shoulders
Try to be someone, yeah

When the world outside
Is outta control like my mind
I take it all in stride
Why, why, why?
Why do I feel so calm
When everything goes wrong?
Is that what I want?
Why, why?

It's the little things I get mad about
The couch is so worn-in
Little things are gonna bring me down
Can't smile with a double chin
So while I'm waiting, chasing awakenings
It's the little things that all add up
Death by a thousand cuts
It's death by a thousand cuts

There's a physical reaction
When I'm craving distress
Yeah I might have to take it out
'Cause it can't stay in my chest
Don't I look better when I'm slouching
With a pebble on my back?
And the second I admit it
I wish I could take it back

Why do I feel so calm
When everything goes wrong?
Is that what I want?
Why, why?

It's the little things I get mad about
The couch is so worn-in
Little things are gonna bring me down
Can't smile with a double chin
So while I'm waiting, chasing awakenings
It's the little things that all add up
Death by a thousand cuts

I put my head on my shoulders
Try to be someone, yeah
I tilt my person three degrees
To try to get along, yeah
It's so uncomfortable
Trying to fit into this skin, yeah
I put my head on my shoulders
Try to be someone, yeah

Death by a thousand
Death by a thousand little things
Death by a thousand
Death by a thousand little things
