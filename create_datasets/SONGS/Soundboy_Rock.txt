Turn up the fever, operator overstand
We need a leader one to makes us feel and jam
Give us a future, forward in a slow motion
Bring out the magic, more than we can remember

Hear me when I say, ho, we move ya, move ya, move ya
Soundboy rock, move ya, move ya, move ya
Hear me when I say, hey, we move ya, move ya, move ya
Soundboy rock, move ya, move ya, move ya
Forward a version

I hope it happens, been a lot of talk and ting
We been awaiting, waiting patiently
I feel a calling, hear it calling me
The voice of ages, won't you join with me?

Hear me when I say, ho, we move ya, move ya, move ya
Soundboy rock, move ya, move ya, move ya
Hear me when I say, hey, we move ya, move ya, move ya
Soundboy rock, move ya, move ya, move ya
Forward a version

Rock it ya, rock it ya

You hear, hey, we move ya, move ya, move ya
Soundboy rock, move ya, move ya, move ya
Soundboy rock, move ya, move ya, move ya
Forward a version

Over and over and over
