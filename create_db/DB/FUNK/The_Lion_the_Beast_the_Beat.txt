Steady now, steady now
Don't fear what you can't see
Ready now, ready now
I'll hold on to you, you hold on to me

Ooh

I found the heart of a lion
In the belly of the beast
And I held it in my hand, and I could feel
I could feel, feel the beat

Gas up the easy rider
And head out for Nevada
Can somebody let the beast out, baby

It's time to meet your maker
Make the road your undertaker
Can somebody let the beast out, baby

Can't stop the beat, can't stop the beat
Run, but you can't hide from the heat
Life is a record, playing on repeat
I'm running wild, with The Lion The Beast The Beat

So don't you try to tame the lion
Just to ride on the horizon
Can somebody let the beast out, baby

Yeah, we all hide our desire
And then we feel the beat like fire
Will somebody let the beast out, baby

Oh

Can't stop the beat, can't stop the beat
Run, but you can't hide from the heat
When life is a record, playing on repeat
I'm running wild with The Lion The Beast The Beat

Oh

Can't stop the beat, can't stop the beat
Run, but you can't hide from the heat
When life is a record, playing on repeat
I'm running wild with The Lion The Beast The Beat
