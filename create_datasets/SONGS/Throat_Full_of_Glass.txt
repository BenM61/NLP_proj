Beyond cruel received
The comfort in a broken heart
Now palette shades
An image after life

Alone, surrounded by a million faces
One by one
I see the judgment in your eyes

Like a disease
I'm always in the wrong
And now the numbness wearing off
Can't stand the pain

I get in line, I always do
Need to be patient while perfecting
That's the sign

I cannot help it, can't decline
It's always better down the line
I'm in the wrong and I've done it all before

And I wish I'd never been
And I know it's just a dream
Now I'm blind, I can't open my eyes

Can't stay awake, burning alive
I cannot breathe this poison air filled with lies
I cannot see what's done to me
Live in fear, the sun is falling from the sky
Can't stay awake

Nothing left to break my rivals
In a thousand pieces, million reasons
Why should I keep myself away?

Hard to define
It always is
It's hard to scream with a throat full of glass

I cannot help it, can't decline
It's always better down the line
I'm in the wrong and I've done it all before

And I wish I'd never been
And I know it's just a dream
Now I'm blind I can't open my eyes

Can't stay awake, burning alive
I cannot breathe this poison air filled with lies
I cannot see what's done to me
Live in fear, the sun is falling from the sky
Can't stay awake

Can't stay awake, burning alive
I cannot breathe this poison air filled with lies
I cannot see what's done to me
Live in fear, the sun is falling from the sky
Can't stay awake

Can't stay awake
