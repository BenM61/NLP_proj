She was a punk Lolita
C.B.G.B. era
Holes in her stocking
Nothing is shocking
Down at the heels
Had what it takes to feel
She could rock the world
She was a punk girl, Ooooh

You don't care that I'm just a punk girl doin' it funky
You don't care that I'm just a punk girl doin' it.

Get offa your pedestal
It's a freakin' free world
Get offa your pedestal
It's a freakin'!

She was a punk Lolita
Anya and Lydia
La petite Damita
Could easily eat ya
Holes in her stocking
Nothing is shocking
Down at the heels
Keepin' it real, oh

You don't care that I'm just a punk girl doin' it funky
You don't care that I'm just a punk girl doin' it.
You don't care that I'm just a punk girl doin' it funky
You don't care that I'm just a punk girl doin' it.

She was a punk Lolita
C.B.G.B. era
Connie and Roxie
And sweet Roberta
Who manned the door
So if you were poor
You'd get in for free
C.B.G.B. la! oh

You don't care that I'm just a punk girl doin' it funky
You don't care that I'm just a punk girl doin' it.

Get offa your pedestal
It's a freakin' free world
Get offa your pedestal
It's a freakin'!

You don't care that I'm just a punk girl doin' it funky
You don't care that I'm just a punk girl doin' it.
You don't care that I'm just a punk girl doin' it funky
You don't care that I'm just a punk girl doin' it.
