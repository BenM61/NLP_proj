I'm not alone, you're sittin' right there
How come I get the feeling,
You could vanish into the air?
I love you more than anybody else baby
Can't you tell I'm an easy touch
Oh, baby baby, I think I love you too much

If I picked you up, you'd slip right away
And if I locked you up,
You'd find a way to make me stay
You're gonna hurt me more than anybody baby,
'cause you know I'm an easy touch
Oh, baby baby, I think I love you too much

I guess I'm gonna give you what you want,
'cause I so in to you
You never give an inch to me baby,
Though I've been giving you a mile or two

I'm not alone, you're sittin' right there
How come I get the feeling,
You could vanish into the air?
I love you more than anybody else baby
Can't you tell I'm an easy touch
Oh, baby baby, I think I love you too much
