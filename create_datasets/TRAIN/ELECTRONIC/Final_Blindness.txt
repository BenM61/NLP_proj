And tonight in Los Angeles, California
Thousands of teenagers will drive up and down Hollywood Boulevard
Endlessly searching for
Sex!
Come on, baby!
Come on, baby!
Welcome to the temple
Welcome to the temple
Welcome to the temple of the expanded mind!
Oh!
Is there anyone out there who believes?
I believe!
All right
Up and down
Hey!
Up and down
Ah!
Up and down
Come on, baby
Endlessly searching!
Up and down
Hey!
Up and down
Ah!
Up and down
Come on, baby
Endlessly searching!
Up and down
Hey!
Up and down
Ah!
Up and down
Come on, baby
Endlessly searching!
Up and down
Hey!
Up and down
Ah!
Up and down
Come on, baby
Endlessly searching for
Sex!
And tonight in Los Angeles, California
Thousands of teenagers will drive up and down Hollywood Boulevard
Endlessly searching
And endlessly searching
And endlessly searching for
Satan!
He's the one...
He's the only one...
He's the one...
He's the only one...
He's the one...
He's the only one...
He's the one...
He's the only one...
Oh!
Look what you did!
And you did it on purpose!
And you did it on purpose!
My master and my god
I want no other!
