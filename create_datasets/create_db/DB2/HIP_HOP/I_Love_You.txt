Oh

All those pretty memories,
I know you can hear me now
For the record,
I love you, I love you
All those pretty memories,
I know you can hear me now
For the record,
I love you, I love you

When I found out that you were leaving me,
I couldn't sleep thinking about
All the things that we've been through
Now all that I want to do
Is tell you that I, (I)
Miss you, so much
(You know I really really miss you)

All those pretty memories,
I know you can hear me now
For the record,
I love you, I love you
All those pretty memories,
I know you can hear me now
For the record,
I love you, I love you

Now that I'm on my own
I know that in time I'll find somebody new
(Who'll treat me better than you)
So I'll go all alone without you
But I still love you
You know I'll never live without you

All those pretty memories,
I know you can hear me now
For the record,
I love you, I love you
All those pretty memories,
I know you can hear me now
For the record,
I love you, I love you

I wish you'd change your ways soon enough
So we can be together
You just don't understand good enough
But now all we have is memories

All those pretty memories,
I know you can hear me now
For the record,
I love you, I love you
All those pretty memories,
I know you can hear me now
For the record,
I love you, I love you
Memories we shared
No one else could compare
Oh, I miss you, I miss you
Oh I miss you

Of the way we used to be,
Oh, those pretty memories

Oh
I miss you
I miss you
Oh, I miss you
Oh
