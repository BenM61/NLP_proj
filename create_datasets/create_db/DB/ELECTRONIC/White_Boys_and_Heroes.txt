We're in the movies
We're heroes
We sparkle at night

Love among puppets
And one day
I'll pull all the strings

White boys and heroes
White boys and heroes
See boys say I'm mayhem

Was my wife the doctor
The patient
Or something obscene

A history of nothing
Like a see-through song in disguise

Heroes are tough
And have no time
For women and boys

I won't cry
'Til this thing is over
And someone agrees

White boys and heroes
White boys and heroes
See boys say I'm mayhem

White boys and heroes
We have no time for celebration
We have no time left at all
White boys and heroes
