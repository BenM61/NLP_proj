And the morning comes with coffee we can share
And the smell of cigarettes is in your hair
There's the sound of shouts outside the hotel room
Like the night before when cameras flattered you

And if we don't have a future
If our lives split like shattered bits of glass
And if we don't have a future
Just leave your autograph
Your autograph

And the night that saw the neon lit our fate
And our shadows painted many different shapes
But now the moon has turned complex and altered you
There's just the smell of cigarettes left in the room

And we made saved conversation
And we kick through broken bits of glass
And it's all just complication
And too complex to ever last

Cause if we don't have a future
And if this kiss dissolves into the past
And if we don't have a future
Just leave your autograph
Your autograph
Just leave your autograph
Your autograph
Just leave your autograph
Your autograph
