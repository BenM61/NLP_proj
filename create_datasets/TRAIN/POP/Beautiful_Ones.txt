Pick up your phone, put on your coat
Everyone's looking up at you
Push through the crowd, into the sound
Of everyone talking about you

Don't be afraid
Honey, one day this will fade
So put on a smile, do it in style
Make them all desperate to be you
Make them all desperate to be you
Make them all desperate to be you

Don't think twice
Give yourself to another night
Hold on tight
Hope that you make it out alive
Ohh, we are the beautiful ones
Ohh, we are the beautiful ones

It's just a phase, you're not to blame
For everyone trying to please you
But you're too young to come undone
So don't let them try to deceive you

Don't be ashamed
Honey, one day this will fade
So put on your coat, give them a show
Make them all desperate to be you
Make them all desperate to be you
Make them all desperate to be you

Don't think twice
Give yourself to another night
Hold on tight
Hope that you make it out alive
Ohh, we are the beautiful ones
Ohh, we are the beautiful ones

We are the, we are the
We are the beautiful ones
We are the, we are the
We are the beautiful ones
We are the (we are the), we are the (we are the)
We are the beautiful ones
We are the, we are the
We are the beautiful ones

We are the, we are the
We are the beautiful ones
We are the, we are the
We are the beautiful ones
We are the (we are the), we are the (we are the)
We are the beautiful ones
We are the, we are the
We are the beautiful ones

Oh baby, don't think twice
Give yourself to another night
Hold on tight
Hope that you make it out alive
Ohh, we are the beautiful ones
Ohh, we are the beautiful ones

Beautiful, so beautiful
Beautiful, so beautiful
Beautiful, so beautiful
Beautiful, so beautiful
Beautiful, so beautiful
Beautiful, so beautiful
Beautiful, so beautiful
We are the beautiful ones
