Halfway 'round the planet
And the telephone won't do
I'm starin' up at midnight
But lookin' just for you
If you're aching in the starlight
And looking for me too
Then, gazing at the same sight
Might I not see you?

We'll rendezvous on Venus
And dance on Saturn's rings
We'll drink a little moonlight
And ride the old man's wings
I do believe you love me
I wish with all my might
Somewhere in the stars
I'll be meeting you tonight

With feet on terra firma
And heart in Milky Way
We'll ask the the old timekeeper
To look the other way

We'll rendezvous on Venus
Dance on Saturn's wings
We'll drink a little moonlight
And ride the old man's wings
I do believe you love me
I wish with all my might
Somewhere in the stars
I'll be meeting you tonight
