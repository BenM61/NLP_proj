Daddy got his oak leafs yesterday
And missed your graduation so you say
Well it's time to find somebody new to believe in

You seem to me the type of girl that men forget
From face to face to back to bed
You spend most your time 
Walking off the letdowns

But the hardest thing for you 
Is just to let that bell ring true and everybody knows

A little rain must fall, everybody knows
A little rain must fall

Well I should be the one to talk
But I seem OK, not worth a damn or so they say
Well I wish that boy would find one thing he can believe in 

I used to be the type to cry but now I laugh 
From wall street hippie to sociopath
I spend most of my time
Walking off the letdowns

But the hardest thing to do
Is just to let that bell ring true and everybody knows

A little rain must fall everybody knows
A little rain must fall but we can wait it out together
You see it never lasts forever and everybody knows
A little rain must fall

Now I know I'll find the sunshine to soothe me when I'm needy
And I know this is just a little rise in the road
And I can feel my luck is changing and it's rising up to greet me
And I can see there's just a little farther to go
Oh but right now everybody knows

Well the sun comes up in different ways in Rockwell paintings and Hemingway
Now who do you suppose those two fools believed in
Is it just a stroke of luck fat chance or is it just a matter of circumstance
Well perfection sure get's boring anyway
But tomorrow's another day 
And everybody knows

A little rain must fall everybody knows
A little rain must fall but we can wait it out together
You see it never lasts forever and everybody knows
A little rain must fall
