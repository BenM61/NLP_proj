Darkness, darkness all around
And my senses have been stripped
Of sight and sound

Suddenly I came to, I pulled through
Amazed at what I saw
Struggling hard to find the words
When words tends to stick right in my craw

I'm talking about seizing the moments
When the moment has gone
There's no telling me 'cause I'm holding on
Hoping against hope that you've got it wrong

If you could love me
Like I love you
If you could love me
Like I love you

Frozen in time and space
Yet I feel no need
To get out of this place

And suddenly the earth moved
The planets grooved, I fell down on my knees
Someone whispered take your leave
You're free to go any way you please

I'm talking about seizing the moments
When the moment has gone
There's no telling me 'cause I'm holding on
Hoping against hope that you've got it wrong

If you could love me
Like I love you
If you could love me
Like I love you

I'm talking 'bout holding out
So scared to follow through
I'm talking 'bout holding out
So scared of losing you

If you could love me
Like I love you
If you could love me
Like I love you

If you could love me
Like I love you
Like I love you
Like I love you
'Cause I love you
