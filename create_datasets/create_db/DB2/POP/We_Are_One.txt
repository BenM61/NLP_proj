As you go through life you'll see
There is so much that we
Don't understand

And the only thing we know
Is things don't always go
The way we planned

When it seems all your dreams come undone

We are more than we are
We are one

If there's so much I must be
Can I still just be me
The way I am?

Can I trust in my own heart
Or am I just one part
Of some big plan?

Your journey has only begun

Is our pride, deep inside
We are one

Family, family, we are one
Family, family, we are one

One family under the sun

You will find when you see
We are one

Family, family, we are one
Family, family, we are one
Family, family, we are one
Family, family, we are one
Family, family, we are one
Family, family, we are one
Family, family, we are one
