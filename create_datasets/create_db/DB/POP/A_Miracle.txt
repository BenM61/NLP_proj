Sent from God
A holy visit
I wake up in the night
"What is it?"
I'm startled and I'm cold
And I believe
I have problems in my dreams
I feel like I'm the only one
Who can carry your disease

In my head you are suffering
In my head you are

He brings me flowers that are gold
And honey from the bees
He places a blossom in my hair
And undresses me
He tells me that I'm the only one
That can carry his disease
I'm made to be an animal by his love
And to bear his baby

In my head you are suffering
In my head you are
