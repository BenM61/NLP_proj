I looked deep within my pocket
For the note you sent to me
To put it in a nutshell
You're a heartless mercenary

Shoo-shoo-shoo-shoodoo, goodness gracious
Shoo-shoo-shoo-shoodoo, you're so audacious
Shoo-shoo-shoo-shoodoo

I looked behind the iron curtain
For a greater dignity
And now I'm more than certain
You're a heartless mercenary

Shoo-shoo-shoo-shoodoo, goodness gracious
Shoo-shoo-shoo-shoodoo, you're so audacious
Push me and pull me
The blind lead the blind
I don't have no money
Can I pay you in kind?

Shoo-shoo-shoo-shoodoo, goodness gracious
Shoo-shoo-shoo-shoodoo, you're so audacious
Shoo-shoo-shoo-shoodoo
