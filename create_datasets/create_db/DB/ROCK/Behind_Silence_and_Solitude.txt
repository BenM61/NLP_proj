You face me in silence and hope is in your eyes
Unspoken yet pleading you wait for my reply
Alone now I tremble in want of your embrace
Let not tears fall for me, let me show the way

Don't know why you have such belief in m
To justify this I'd try eternally
I will not forget what you've done for me
Shed not a tear I'll be with you endlessly

How I wish I could say
What you want to hear
Long ago I swore that I'd always keep you near
I know now it seems like my vow was empty then
But in time you will see I'd do it all again

I lie back close my eyes again
The dreams are there
My last chance slipped away
You'll never know I cared
I count this with reason as most of my regret
Now I hope you can see that I will not forget
