Everybody wants to be a winner
And take their place at the top
Everyone wants their name up in lights, 
For the good times never stop

Sometimes the bad luck will creep up and catch you by surprise
Your mind's confused,
You feel misused
You've got to leave those troubles behind

Sometimes you win,
Sometimes you lose
Sometimes you want to cry,
Sometimes you play the fool

(Tag:)
Hold on a little longer
Try to be a little stronger
And you can win
You can win
And everything is gonna be yours

When you cry the whole world laughs at you
They don't seem to understand
But the time will come when the tables turn
And you're gonna have the winning hand

Sometimes you win,
Sometimes you lose
Sometimes you want to cry,
Sometimes you play the fool
