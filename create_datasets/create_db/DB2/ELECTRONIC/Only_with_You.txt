La da di
Only with you
La da di
Lonely and blue
Without you baby I'll die
Without you baby I can't smile

Oh baby I'm ready
And I need you like insane
Oh, I miss you like crazy
Miss you more and more everyday
Or maybe it's better to leave me alone
And maybe it's better
Your heart is a stone
And maybe it's better
A dream that I keep on my own

Only with you
Only with you
Only with you
Yeah
Oh ja ja ja ja ja hey

Oh baby I'm ready
And I feel we're going away
Oh, I need you - don't fool me
Baby call me and I'll be there
Don't send me roses - again and again
I'm just no hero
I'm just a man
Don't send me roses
A dream that I dream to the end
