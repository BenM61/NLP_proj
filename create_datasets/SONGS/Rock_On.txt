Hey hey
Hey kid rock n roll
Rock on
Cool my soul
Hey kid boogie too; didn't you

Hey shock summer time blues
Jump up and down on my blue suede shoes
He kid rock n roll
Rock on

Where do go from here?
Which is the way that's clear?

Still looking for that blue jean baby queen 
Prettiest girl I've ever seen. 
See'em shake
On the movie screen. 
Jimmy dean.

Rock on, rock on, 
Rock on, rock on

Hard luck lost and found move on, stick around
Making off when the sun goes down, didn't we?

Hard rock sing the blues, 
Nothing left for us to do.
Money gone what you got to loose?

Rock on

Where do we go from here?
Which is the way that's clear?

Still looking for that blue jean baby queen 
Prettiest girl I've ever seen. 
See'em shake
From a movie screen. 
Jimmy dean, jimmy dean, jd.
