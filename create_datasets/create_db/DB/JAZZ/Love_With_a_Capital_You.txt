You may spell love with capital "L" 
But I spell love with a capital "You" 
Through the day you're away 
And I'm mopin', mopin' mope 
And you do too, I hope, I hope, I hope 
All life through, love with a capital "You" 
Would just suit me to a capital "T" 
I can spell just as well as the dictionaries do, 
But I spell love with a capital "You"!
