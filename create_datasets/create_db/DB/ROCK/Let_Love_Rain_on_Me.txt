Please forgive me for calling in the deepest dead of night
But I found a million ways that I could try to make things right
I want to bring you more than reason to take me back again

Let love rain on me like it did before
Let love rain on me I can?t take it anymore
Drown me in the see
Let love rain on me

I had walked through miles of desert and drenched them with my tears
In these days I?ve been away from I have aged 100 years
So please don?t keep me waiting wishing on the stars above
Just give me your forgiveness ? I return it with my love

Let love rain on me like it did before
Let love rain on me I can?t take it anymore
Drown me in the see
Let love rain on me

Let love rain on me like it did before
I have been through fire
I can?t take it anymore
Drown me in the see
Let love rain on me

Let love rain on me like it did before
Let love rain on me I can?t take it anymore
Drown me in the see
Let love rain on me

Let love rain on me
Let love rain on me
