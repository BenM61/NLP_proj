All night, straight ahead at the headlights
Scream at me, baby
Yelling like I ruined your life
All night with my back against the wall
Push me, push me, I'll never fall, oh

Baby, this mistrust is contagious
I'm going crazy
Looking for something to save us

You can try and bend my heart but it won't break
You can change my clothes, you can change my name
Break, break, break out of these chains
I can bend, bend, bend so far but I won't break

Oh, oh, oh
Disappear in the middle of night
Shame baby, when its good, it's so right
I'm tired of it now, stop building all these walls
Head trip now, head trip, then we fall off

Baby, this mistrust is contagious
I'm going crazy
Looking for something to save us

You can try and bend my heart but it won't break
You can change my clothes, you can change my name
Break, break, break out of these chains
I can bend, bend, bend so far but I won't break

You hold onto my heart so hard
And I just follow as you spin me around
You fill me up with fear so far that I can't swallow and I can't make a sound

Oh, oh, oh
You can try and bend my heart but it won't break
You can change my clothes, you can change my name
Break, break, break out of these chains
I can bend, bend, bend so far but I won't break

You can try and bend my heart but it won't break
You can change my clothes, you can change my name
Break, break, break out of these chains
I can bend, bend, bend so far but I won't break

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
