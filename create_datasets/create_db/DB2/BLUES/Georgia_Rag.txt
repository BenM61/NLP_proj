Down in Atlanta on Harris Street
That's where the boys and girls do meet
Doin' that rag, that Georgia Rag

Out in the alley, in the street
Every little kid, that you meet
Doin' that rag, that Georgia Rag (swing that Georgia Rag boy)

Buzz around like a bee
Shake it like a ship on the sea
That wild rag, that crazy rag
Better known as the Georgia Rag

Came all the way from Paris, France
Come Atlanta to get a chance
To do that Rag, that Georgia Rag (move a little bit further)

That Georgia Rag
Grab your momma and hold her tight
Let's mess around the rest of the night
Doin' that rag, that Georgia Rag (swing that Georgia Rag)

I enjoy that Georgia Rag
I'm all about that Georgia Rag
I mean that Georgie Rag, Georgie Rag

Buzz around like a bee
Shake it like a ship on the sea
That wild rag, that crazy rag
Better known as the Georgia Rag

Now move it
That stuff make you feel good right in there

Throw your hatway up high
Grab your daddy and make him cry
Doin' that rag, that Georgia Rag

I'm all about the Georgia Rag
You all about the Georgia Rag
I mean that Georgie Rag, Georgie Rag

'Cause you buzz around like a bee
Shake it like a ship on the sea
That wild rag, that crazy rag
Better known as the Georgia Rag (oh move it now)

Oh you shake it like a ship on the sea
Buzz around like a bee
That Georgia Rag
That wild rag, better known as the Georgia Rag

Peoples come from miles around
Get into Darktown t'break 'em down
Doin' that rag, that Georgia Rag

Out in Darktown night and day
Pile the dancing blues away
Doing that rag, that Georgia Rag (alright now boys spank 'em)

That wild rag, that crazy rag
Better known as the Georgia Rag

Going all the way back to Newport News
Singing these doggone Atlanta blues
'Bout that rag, that Georgia Rag (alright now play that Georgia Rag)

'Cause you buzz around like a bee
Shake it like a ship on the sea
That wild rag, that crazy rag
Better known as the Georgia Rag
