Thursday night,
Everything's fine,
Except you've got that look in your eyes,
When I'm telling a story
And you find it boring your thinking of something to say
You'll go along with and then drop it
And you Humiliate me, in front of our friends

Then I'll use that voice what you find annoyin'
And say something like
"Intelligent input darlin' why don't you just have another beer then?"

Then you call me a bitch and everyone we're with will be embarrassed,
And I won't give a shit

My fingertips are holding onto the
Cracks in our foundations,
And I know that I should let go,
But I can't
And every time we fight I know its not right,
Every time that your upset and I smile
I know I should forget, but I can't

You said I must eat so many lemons,
Cause I am so bitter
I said "I'd rather be with your friends mate,
Cause they are much fitter"

Yes it was childish
And you got aggressive
And I must admit that I was a bit scared,
But it gives me thrills to wind you up

My fingertips are holding onto the
Cracks in our foundations,
And I know that I should let go,

But I can't
And every time we fight,
I know its not right,
Every time that your upset and I smile,
I know I should forget,
But I can't

Your face is pasty,
Cause you've gone and got so wasted,
What a surprise,
Don't want to look at your face,
Cause its making me sick

You've gone and got sick on my trainers,
I only got these Yesterday
Oh my gosh, I cannot be bothered with this

Well I'll leave you there till the mornin',
And I purposely wont turn the heating on
And dear God, I hope I'm not stuck with this one

My fingertips are holding onto the
Cracks in our foundations,
And I know that I should let go,
But I can't
And every time we fight,
I know its not right,
Every time that your upset and I smile,
I know I should forget,
But I can't

And every time we fight I know it's not right,
Every time that you're upset and I smile
I know I should forget, but I can't

And every time we fight I know it's not right,
Every time that you're upset and I smile
I know I should forget, but I can't
