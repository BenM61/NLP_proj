As I wake up in a room somewhere
Dawn light not yet showing.
There's just a thin horizon between me and her
The edge of a half-dream glowing.

Well, you know, I felt her in my dream last night.
Strange how the sheets are warm beside me.
Now, how do I catch the waking edge?
As it slips to the far and wide of me.

Didn't I try to hold it down?
Freeze on the picture, 
Hang sharp on the sound.
Catch the waking edge another time.

Familiar shadows in my hotel room
Are still here for the taking.
They seem to linger on as the street lights fade
And the empty dawn is breaking.

Didn't I try to hold it down?
Freeze on the picture, 
Hang sharp on the sound.
Catch the waking edge another time.

Private movie showing in my head?
What button do I press for re-run?
And how do I catch the waking edge?
The edge of a dream about someone.

Well, you know, I felt her 
In my dream last night
Now the sheets are cold beside me.
