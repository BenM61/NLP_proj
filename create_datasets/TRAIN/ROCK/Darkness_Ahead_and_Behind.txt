Life always dumps something in your lap
You're constantly busy redrawing your map
You leave behind a fading trail
Of images and words that you hope will prevail

Life always dumps something in your way
You try to make the best of it everyday
You could give up and give in but you prefer
To keep hoping some kind of change might occur
Just hoping some kind of change might occur

Misery sure loves company
And nobody's ever who they seem to be
The daily horror of people at their worst
And most selfish, one day, your bubble will burst

So much time should not have passed
At least not that way and not so fast
It wasn't always easy, it wasn't always fun
But it was always worth it, regrets I have none
It was always worth it, regrets I have none

Life always dumps something so you should try.
To acknowledge the fact you're surrounded by
These relics of a life that no longer exists
Your name still appears on the waiting lists

Life always dumps something that makes things worse
There are no rules in this self-help universe
It's never what you were expecting to find.
There's darkness ahead and there's darkness behind.
There's darkness ahead and there's darkness behind.

There's darkness ahead and there's darkness behind.
