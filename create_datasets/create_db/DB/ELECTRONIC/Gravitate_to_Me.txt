I've been watching you for ages. You're like a boat without a mast. 
Struggling with the tide of destiny. 
Between the future & the past.

I AM THE LIGHTHOUSE. I AM THE SEA.
I AM THE AIR THAT YOU BREATHE. GRAVITATE TO ME...

Through the ether & the mists of the mind. 
You will come to me, to lay by me side.
To stroke my hair. To cuddle my flesh.
And to quell the torrents in my subterranean depths.

This world ain't strong enough to keep us from each other.
For, we are kindred spirits. Born to become earthly lovers.

And while my vanity struggles against my integrity. 
I find myself thinking...how deep runs my humanity?
When held up against eternity?

I AM THE LIGHTHOUSE. I AM THE SEA.
I AM THE AIR THAT YOU BREATHE. GRAVITATE TO ME...

There is something within your voice.
something behind your eyes.
something inside your heart.
that is beating in time with mine...

I KNOW YOU!
From a previous incarnation...
I KNOW YOU!
From a previous incarnation...
I KNOW YOU!
From a previous incarnation...
