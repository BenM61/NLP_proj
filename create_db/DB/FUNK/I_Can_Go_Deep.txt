So tell me baby
What you want to do?

We got all night
So baby it's on, it's on, it's on, yeah
Deeper, deeper baby
Deeper than he's ever gone
Cause I can go on and on and on
You've got to show me lady
Just how you feel
I want to relax your mind
And go so deep
Because I can go deeper baby
Deeper than he's ever gone
cause I need it, and you want it
cause you've got what I want and I want what's inside

[Chorus 1]
Can we do it on the low
Keep the lights down
I can do a sex move and get funky
Working it like it ain't no thing
Making it sweet in the sheets
From your head down to your feet

[Chorus 2]
Deeper, deeper baby
Deeper than he's ever gone
So baby it's on, it's on, it's on
I can go deeper, deeper baby
Deeper than he's ever gone
Cause I can go on, and on, and on

Champagne and candle lights would be nice
Just me and you
Let's start things off right tonight
Girl, what should we do babe
Let's sit and fantasize about me and you
We're taking it up and down and round and round
Giving you everything that you need

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

Deeper baby, deeper baby
Deeper than he's ever gone
Deeper baby, deeper baby
Deeper than he's ever gone

I can go deep if you let me
I can go deep if you want me
I can go deep when you want me to
I can go deep

I can go deep if you let me
I can go deep if you want me
I can go deep when you want me to
I can go deep

[Chorus 2: Repeats]
