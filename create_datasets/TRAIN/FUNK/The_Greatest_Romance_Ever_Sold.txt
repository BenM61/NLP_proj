The greatest romance that's ever been sold

So what do you know, you and me
Finally face to face
Checking each other up and down
In all of the obvious places
Was there ever a reason for us to be apart?
The air that fills up this room says, "not hardly"
So this is where you end, and you and I begin
(That's where you and I, you and I begin)

Baby, baby
Now your mind is open 
To poetry seldom heard
You're heart has never been broken
Until you've heard these words,
"Your body was designed to respond to mine
In spite of your desire to mold me"
And in the middle of it all,
We kiss and like rain (like rain) we fall into

Oh, I know you can feel me,know that you can dance
But what do you know about the greatest romance?
Not what you think, but what you believe
What was the real reason that Adam never left Eve?
And if the truth sounds like a memory
Then you know it was meant to be (meant to be), meant to be
Leave your inhibitions behind come on, come on, and see
So this is where you end (this is where you end)
And you and I begin

Listen to me
(that's ever been sold)

You brought me
The grapes from the vine, yes you did
(The greatest romance)
Can I talk to you
(that's ever been sold)
Listen
You help me to remember the secrets of time
And you, you, you, you offer me your love, your love, your love 
So divine
And in return, girl, in return I will surrender
Oh yeah, I will surrender, oh yes, I will
