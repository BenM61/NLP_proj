We flew into town on Sunday
Had to find a place by Monday
Tried Bridgeport and Westport
'Til we found a place that we thought would do
157 Riverside Avenue

Saugatuck River's flowin'
Mother nature's colors were showin'
So cold, so rainy, we couldn't help feelin' blue
Not enough time, too many things to do
So we just sat back and played some

Well we met a young girl on Main Street
Wanted to pass her by
She was homely, and we were lonely
She said,can I make love to you?
I said, "157 Riverside Avenue"

And see she talk like a guitar, she said
Oh a fast talkin' woman

It's over, Miss Lena, we're leaving
Such a pleasant stay, I must say
So nice, so easy
We hate to say goodbye to you
At 157 Riverside Avenue
