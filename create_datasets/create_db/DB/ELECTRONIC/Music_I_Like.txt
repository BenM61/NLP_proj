Your love is coming into my life
It makes me feel good inside
I need a moment of ecstasy
A feeling higher then high

This is the music I like
This is the music I like

Your love is coming into my life
It makes me feel good inside
I need a moment of ecstasy
A feeling higher then high
I want to live with my fantasy
Dancing into the light
And I can play with my destiny
It makes me feel satisfied

This is the music I like
This is the music I like 
This is the music I like 
This is the music I like 
This is the music I like 

A fire is burning inside of me
Feel the rhythm of life
I need your loving to set me free
I want you to stay by my side.
