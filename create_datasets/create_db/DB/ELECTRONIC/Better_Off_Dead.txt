Tell me why don't you kill me
And put a gun against my head?
I'm better off dead
I'm better off dead

I want it over by now
Why don't you kill me with your love?
I'm better off dead
I'm better off dead

There's no time to regret
I'm laying naked on my bed
I'm better off dead
I'm better

To feel you
When you hold me
When you touch me
You said that you forgive me
'Cause you never hold me
'Cause you never touch me
You said that you forgive me

I want it over by now
Why don't you kill me with your love?
I'm better off dead
I'm better off dead

I've been fooling myself
I can't explain why I'm still here
I'm better off dead
I'm better

To feel you
When you hold me
When you touch me
You said that you forgive me
'Cause you never hold me
'Cause you never touch me
You said that you forgive
You always told me I'm the one to blame
But you never told me what's hiding behind these walls
An empty shell of faith desire and lust
So show me what you've got

To feel you
When you hold me
When you touch me
You said that you forgive me
'Cause you never hold me
'Cause you never touch me
You said that you forgive
You always told me I'm the one to blame
But you never told me what's hiding behind these walls
An empty shell of faith desire and lust
So show me what you've got
