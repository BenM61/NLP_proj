I looked at the sun through filters
A hit that drove out lots of colors
I took off high like a feather
Blown to the ground on my shoulder

You fell, are you okay?
Do you need a hand?

I'm okay, let me go
Go away, I'm alright
Leave me here
Go back home
I'm okay, you just go

I could hear two sounds in the air
The leaving steps of a guilty sister
The other sound was the water
I leaned and looked into her river

Thanks for the favor
The world little sister

I'm okay, I feel good
I can breathe, fill my soul
I'm okay, feeling good
Why do I swim in blood?

La, la, la
La, la, la
