Who told you I serve and flip?
Ride my bike on a burnham dip
Man talk but I'm gonna burn 'em quick
Mad man nutty on a sherman tip
Dem man wanna mess with my aura
Someone said that's bang out of order
Can't make 6 foot man feel smaller
Treat dem man like private caller

And I don't wanna box man trust me
Who told you that I got rusty?
Trawl for the WD40
Punch up big man, I'll like 40
Big boy buy big ting 650
Moving along on the road too quickly
Though big dogs in this biz
I never see no man chasing frisbees

When I big over there
Dem man don't live over there
Man will take off ya wig over there
Don't care who you're with over there
When mana-mans hungry, mana-man eat
Mana-mans tired, mana-man sleep
Mana-man talking, mana-man speak
They link girls that mana-man beat
Don't be on a hero ting
Keep it moving earphones in
Lickle man, man had to chief up him
Punch up scratchy, cheif up trim
When mana-mans driving, mana-man speed
Mana-mans smoking mana-mans weed
Give mana-man space, let mana-man breathe
When I arrive, mana-man leave

Bad boy krep, German whip
Not white Vans, or white vans
When boy dem try ask for my name
I say oldskool Meridian man
Guys better show respect
If they see man pullin up in a TT (trust!)
Guys better show respect
If they see man fillin up in BP (trust!)
20 Pound of Diesel mate
If I fill up my tank it'll make me late
I ain't gonna lie
I see you man on foot on the high road moving bait
Man's just try'na stack paper
Don't watch what man's earning
Man paid over 30 bags sterling
German whip but I ain't in Berlin
