Da da da da da
All work an no play
That's the way it is, aint it
There's rhythm deep inside of you
And you must get reacquainted

When was the last time
You danced
When was the last time
You danced
Well come rock with me baby
Dance with me darling
Step with me sweetheart
The world is watching

Under an endless sky
Wish I could fly away forever
An ever
And the poetry is so pure
When we are on the floor together
It's been a long time

When was the last time
You danced
When was the last time
You danced
Well come rock with me baby
Dance with me darling
Step with me sweetheart
The world is watching

Ooh
Ooh
Mmm
Wooh
Ooh!
Don't deny me any further
Mmm mmm
Let me have my way
Mmm mmm
Ooh come closer, yeah
Let's dance the night away

Come rock with me baby
Dance with me darling
Step with me sweetheart
The world is watching
Woah
Ooh
Ah huh baby
Hee hee
