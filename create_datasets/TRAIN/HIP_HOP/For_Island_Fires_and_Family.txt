How it must feel to be a bird
Roamin' lonely over sea air
How it must feel to be a bird
London, Paris, underneath
And I'll wait on my own
(Ooh, hmm, ooh)

And I couldn't tell you enough that I'm sorry
And no, you couldn't tell me enough that you love me
But she's bringin' the moon and stars to me
Damn permanent reverie
And even though this life, this love is brief
I've got some people who carry me

Wasn't it love as soon as we knew each other properly?
Livin' 'bout half right 'til a certain person got to me
Nothin' is secret, everythin's sacred, how it ought to be
Under the moonlight on a clear night
On rooftops is where I want to be
Sometimes I'm like a child, that's somethin' I can't release
Dreams of her comin' home, sweet home
And I'm tellin' you home is so sweet
Said you reminded me of the summertime, and I still mean that
In a full room, I'm the only one she's smilin' at
So wouldn't you let me know if you were thinkin' less of me?
That's what she asked me
What was promised, what we both agreed
But truthfully, if you ever go
You'll drop me straight to Hell, the 7th circle
And I was talkin' with you earlier
We were open and vulnerable, it was wonderful
I, I used to dream that you would talk to me
I used to dream that you would talk to me

And I couldn't tell you enough that I'm sorry
And no, you couldn't tell me enough that you love me
But she's bringin' the moon and stars to me
Damn permanent reverie
And even though this life, this love is brief
I've got some people who carry me

You know that feelin' when you think your heart is gonna come right out through your shirt?
Get it a couple times a year
But I've been gettin' it more often with her
Now when I'm face to face with death, I'll grab his throat
And ask him, "How does it hurt?"
Up in those golden moments, growin' old too quickly
Was he thinkin' of her?

But she's bringin' the moon and stars to me
Damn permanent reverie
And even though this life, this love is brief
I've got some people who carry me
