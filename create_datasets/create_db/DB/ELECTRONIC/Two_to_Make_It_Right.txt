It takes two, it takes two, me & you 
It takes two to make a thing go right 
It takes two to make it out of sight 

From the start its plain to see 
you're suffering from a serious broken heart, 
You know that its a shame 
But I'm here to ease your pain 
there's no need for you to feel so all alone 
When you and I could seriously 
Be a sure enough happening thing 

Do you know that 
It takes two to make a thing go right 
It takes two to make it out of sight 

I can see it in your eyes 
You feel the same way I feel about you 
Some call it chemistry 
I call it you should be with me 
Cause I know together we can really turn this mother out 
In my mind there is no doubt 
That one & one equals me & you 

Don't you know that it takes two 
Two to make it right 
I don't believe in fairy tales 
But I believe some things were meant to be 
Why should we be alone 
When we could have each others arms to hold 
I know together we could really turn this mother out 
In my mind there is no doubt 
That one & one equals me & you 

Don't you know that it takes two
