What's this I hear about these perfect 10s
My colleagues squawk about
Them Ritzy girl friends
A hundred pounds, a hundred pounds of trash
They talk to me, they ramble on in my ears
And their conversation's boring
I would bet anyone 50 dollars
'Cause I only wagon on the surest things
Anywhere, anywhere she would go
I would follow 500 miles away from home
Just for a fling, for a fling

I haven't known too many women
Throughout my less than lustrous career
But of all the relationships I've been in
To my 26 the others can't compare
She's my best bosom buddy, she's my partner
In the things I find important to share
She is fine, incredibly fine, it's no wonder
That she catches, that she catches all the stares
