[intro]

I speak in verses
Prophecies & curses
....I hate my life.

[verse]

No miracle is coming ....[hate you]
It's just a hole 
Nothing's wrong with you
Must maintain control 

Everyone's asking questions
No place is safe
I'll forfeit resurrection
To escape the pain

... I hate my life.

[chorus]

I HATE MY LIFE.

[verse]

I speak in verses
Prophecies & curses

This storm of thorns is growing ....[hate me]
There's no end in sight 
Chaos claws my jaw
& incites a mental riot 

I'm in the mouth of madness
With a tongue of poetry
I ate the spine of Atlas
Now the world is crushing me

.... I hate my life.

[chorus]

I HATE MY LIFE.

[outro]

BURIED ALIVE BEHIND ENEMY LINES
SURROGATE CHILD FOR THE SINS OF ALL MANKIND

HATE!!

BURIED ALIVE BEHIND ENEMY LINES
[buried alive, buried alive]

FOR THE SINS OF ALL MANKIND!
