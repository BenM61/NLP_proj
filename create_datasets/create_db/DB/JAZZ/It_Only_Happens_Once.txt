It only happens once,
I'll never feel that thrill again,
It only happens once,
Why couldn't I have known it then?

Since I lost you, dear one,
Nothing seems to be the same,
I tried hard but it's no use,
My heart won't play the game.

It only happens once,
I realize that now is past,
And I was such a dunce,
Because I couldn't make it last.

Why go on pretending?
I just can't love someone new.
It only happens once,
And for me that once was you!

Why go on pretending?
I just can't love someone new.
It only happens once,
And for me that once was you!
