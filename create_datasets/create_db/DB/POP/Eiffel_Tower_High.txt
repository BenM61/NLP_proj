Walking towards the boulevard
She's studied it all before
She buys herself a seat
And sits on the floor

Taking in a picture show
She doesn't know where to go
Is it a film, or is it real?

She went into the movie
She's been there ever since
She walked out to the lobby
For a box of Junior Mints

She never looks beyond the mirror
Or the image that appears
Well, I just watch the world go by
And try to get her attention
Scream at her, and I yell and scream at her
And I scream, ice cream, I scream
I scream "Merry Eiffel Tower High"
