Spent days and tears a paining
I know one thing for sure
I gotta find a brand new lover
And there isn't any other cure
All my low down lowly feelings
Have been working over time somehow
I gotta find me a brand new lover
And it's gotta be right now
 right now
 right now
 right now
 right now
 right now

I got to make some changes
Before the walls close in
I tell you what I'm gonna do
When the night comes down I'll be lookin' for you
I need some consolation
Come baby and take my hand
Gotta find a brand new lover
And I'll take more than I can stand
All my low down lowly feelings
Have been working over time somehow
I gotta find me a brand new lover
And it's gotta be right now
 right now
 right now
 right now
 right now
 right now

I got to make some changes
Before the walls close in
I tell you what I'm gonna do
When the night comes down I'll be lookin' for you
Spent days and tears a paining
I know one thing for sure
I gotta find a brand new lover
And there isn't any other cure
