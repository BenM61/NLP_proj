Going away there's nothing to stay for
Everything we do is some disease
Love is hidden by your fear
So don't make the mistake
Can't sit down
And I can't stand up
'cause if I do I know I'm gonna break
I can't stay in, and I can't go out
'cause if I do I know I'm gonna break

Nothing ever feels this way

'cause if I do I know I'm gonna break
I can't stay in, and I can't go out
'cause if I do I know I'm gonna break
Can't sit down, and I can't stand up
'cause if I do I know I'm gonna break
I can't stay in, and I can't go out
'cause if I do I know I'm gonna break
Uh-oh-uh-oh uh-oh yeah
Uh-oh-uh-oh uh-oh ohhh
Uh-oh-uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh
'cause you know I'm gonna break
Uh-oh-uh-oh uh-oh yeah
Uh-oh-uh-oh uh-oh ohhh
Uh-oh-uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh
Can't sit down, and I can't stand up
'cause if I do I know I'm gonna break
I can't stay in, and I can't go out
'cause if I do I know I'm gonna break
Uh-oh-uh-oh uh-oh yeah
Uh-oh-uh-oh uh-oh ohhh
Uh-oh-uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh
'cause you know I'm gonna
Can't sit down, and I can't stand up
'cause if I do I know I'm gonna break
I can't stay in, and I can't go out
