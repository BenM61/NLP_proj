Oh please release me let me go
I don't love you anymore
To live a lie would be a sin
Release me and let me love again
Oh I have found a new love dear
And I'll always want her near
Her lips, they're warm while yours are cold
Release me and darling let me go
Please release me let me go
I don't love you anymore
To live a lie would be a sin
Release me and let me love again
Please release me let me go
You'd be the fool to cling to me
Oh to live a lie would bring us pain
Release me and let me love again
