Ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...
Doo...doo...doo...
You better let me tell you
Ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...
Doo...doo...doo...

You better let me tell you
You know some time ago our pathways parted
Now you may have found bliss
But I found regret
Maybe you can smile, maybe even laugh
Yeah, but all the while
I'm trying to forget

Tears cannot express my grief nor words my loneliness
For they can only tell apart
Let my heart tell you the rest
I would season every day of my life with you
You better let me tell you
I would show you just what it means to be true, girl
You better let me tell you

'Cause after love has come and gone, baby, I'm the lonely one
Ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh... (Ooh...ooh...)
Ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh... (Ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...)
But why should a man be lonely
(Why should a man be lonely, why should a man be lonely)
When he had someone like you
How can I make you believe
That I got to have you, baby (Got to have you, baby)
Yes, I got to have you, baby (Got to have you, baby)
Oh, I got to have you, baby (Got to have you, baby)

I would sweeten every hour of my day with you
You better let me tell you
I would give you all the things a good lady would need
You better let me tell you
For you I?d save up all of my time, give you every dime
For you, girl, you better let me tell you
'Cause after love has come and gone, baby, I'm the lonely one
Ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh... (Ooh...ooh...)
Ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh... (Ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...)

But why should a man be lonely
(Why should a man be lonely, why should a man be lonely)
When he had someone like you
How can I make you believe
That I got to have you, baby (Got to have you, baby)
Yes, I got to have you, baby (Got to have you, baby)
Oh, I got to have you, baby (Got to have you, baby)

I got to travel alone
Down life's highway
Searching faces, some old, some new
Seeking someone whom I need the most
I know there can't be two
Yeah, I'm searching for someone
Who's the closest thing to you
Gotta go on, gotta go on
I'm so lonely, I gotta go, I'm so lonely, gotta go, yeah...

Oh, I just gotta go
I said, baby, baby, baby, baby, oh
I just-just-just-just got to go (I've got to go, I've got to go)
I'm so lonely (Hey), I gotta go (Oh), I'm so lonely, gotta go, yeah...
(Gotta go on, yeah, yeah)
(Oh, I gotta go, I gotta go, I just gotta go)
Gotta go on, gotta go on
I'm so lonely, I gotta go, I'm so lonely, yeah...yeah
I've just gotta go
Hey, hey, got to, got to, oh, I got to, I just to go on
(I've got to go, I've got go)
I'm so lonely (Hey), I gotta go (Oh)
