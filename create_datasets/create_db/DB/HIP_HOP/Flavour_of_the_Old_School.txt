Feel the flavour for your feet 
Everybody need a place to chill
Gotta stop the world standing still
Don't you know I got a place to go? I tell ya
Funky people let me come back to ya
Understand we got the stuff to move ya
Anybody with the funk ought to know 

So you don't have to play around
Take someone you love
Show them where it's at
''cause there's a time for getting on
Time to feel the flow
like we used to know, and can we

Keep the flavour of the old school
See what happiness we're bringing
Keep the flavour of the old school
Everybody's got that feeling
Keep the flavour of the old school
See what happiness we're bringing
Keep the flavour of the old school
Everybody's got that feeling, that feeling 

Keep the flavour for the babies growing
Pass it on so we can keep them knowing
that positivity is going on, I tell ya
I think about it with your head in motion
Funky music ain't the strangest notion
When you feel it in your soul

Feel the flavour for your feet
''cause it's the one to make you move
Feel the flavour on the street
this is the one to make you groove
