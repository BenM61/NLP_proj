Since I'm so fucking bad 
give me mine 
get yours 
ooooh... 

(Verse 1) 
I woke up this morning 
rocked up 
humping on the matress 
hard like I was fuckin 
I realized I was dreaming 
then I got up 
I hit the Vick's inhaler 
'cause my nose was stuffed up 
from the bed to the floor 
to the bathroom to the sink 
from the mirror to the toilet 
took a piss then shook the shank 
oops  don't look know I think I sprinkled when I tinkled 
so, I dip in the sides there be a sweeter by the seater 
cocoa powder, bubble-bath, and rubbing alcohol 
for 5 fuckin cent that you could buy at the mall 
I'm a long distance super-power, pussy-magnet 
I was born in the ghetto, made by the ghetto 
so fabulous! 

(Charlie Wilson) 
ghetto fabulous - living like this 
I'm so happy, yeah! 
'cause I'm ghetto fabulous (repeat)
'cause I'm ghetto fabulous (repeat)

(Snoop Dogg) (enters over repeat, speaking)
(Snoop Dogg) (enters over repeat, speaking)

Yeah I feel what you're saying, Dog 
but, uhh, you could let these fools know how hard it is 
when a nigga ghetto fabulous, know what I'm saying? 
let's kick that shit! 

(Mystikal) 

(Verse 2) 
it's like a big rush with no time 
niggas be like "whyyyyy" 
kids be like "let me get your autograph" 
bitches be like "ahhhh!" 
ever since I said "here I go" 
braids or not y'all 
they know me wherever I go 
I'm real private 
the windows tinted, doors locked 
the damn crowd you make a scene 
"ain't you Mystikal?" 
"no, I'm not." 
lie to a diehard fan with a straight face 
and let the hour long picture signing session take place 
sign, hey, baby, how you doing? 
what's your name? 
stay real, stay sweet 
stay sexy, stay the same 
and never forget 
I'm never going to change 
I'm loving what I'm doing 
and you can put that on your game 
I got my piece of pie and my piece of mind 
fool, I'm a piece of coal 
don't call me, people, let me shine 
I know you see me on t.v. 
with Snoop, Fiend, Mia, see, Silkk, Serv, and Petey 
nigga we frontin' these street-ies 
but livin' like this ain't easy 
it's fabulous! 
I'm so fucking bad

(Verse 3) 
see, that's a cutie with her big booty 
and her big body 
her and her big fine potnahs 
take their ??? and take their vitamins 
be ordering drinks all down at the bar 
we don't got to buy 
just work that halter top 
and work them tight bell bottoms 
ohhh, you acting funny and trying to holler 
she project Tyra Banks 
the neighborhood super-model 
she shaped like a coke bottle 
hair whipping smelling good 
finger nails and her toes polished 
she did it how she lived 
'cause she got to have it 
first got them fucking kids 
by the baby's daddy 
her ass ain't never what she should have been 
go ahead on and act bad, I'll see ya when I get a hit 
see, she was so fucking bad
