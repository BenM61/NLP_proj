I?ll start this broken heart
I?ll fix it up so it will work again
Better than before
Then I?ll star in a mystery
A tragic tale of all that?s yet to come
Fingers crossed there will be love

But I get carried away with every day
And every fantasy
the deeper the wound,
the harder I swoon and wish that that was me

So much to say
But no words to convey
The loneliness building with each passing day
But I?m getting used to it, you have to get used to it

I?ll devise the best disguise
A brand new look and take them by surprise
They?ll never guess what?s not inside

I?ll express myself with ease,
With confidence and character complete
With fingers crossed they?ll talk to me

But I get carried away with every page
In every magazine
The cheaper the thrill
the deeper I fill my head with blasphemy

So much to say
But No words to convey
The loneliness building with each passing day
But I?m getting used to it, you have to get used to it

I?ll destroy this useless heart
I?ll f*ck it up so it?ll never beat again
Not just for me but for anyone

But I get carried away
with every phrase and made up malady
The longer I hide behind these lies,
The more I disintegrate

So much to say
But no words to convey
The loneliness building with each passing day
But I never get used to it, you just have to live with it
