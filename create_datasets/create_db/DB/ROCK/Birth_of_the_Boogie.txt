Boogie, boogie woogie 
 The boogie-woogie-woogie beat 
 Down in Africa, many years ago 
 There lived a little fella named Zulu Joe 
 He took his tom-tom, a great big stick 
 And that was the birth of the boogie lick 
 Birth of the boogie, birth of the boogie 
 Birth of the boogie, birth of the boogie 
 Birth of the boogie, the boogie-woogie-woogie beat 
 Then Joe got hip and he started to sing 
 The animals flipped and began to swing 
 Monkey, elephant, kangaroo 
 They all picked up on the boogie too 
 Birth of the boogie, birth of the boogie 
 Birth of the boogie, birth of the boogie 
 Birth of the boogie, the boogie-woogie-woogie beat 
 Well, the animals a-boogied all over the place 
 The rabbit spit in the bulldog's face 
 Joe kept a-beatin' till the early morn' 
 And that's when the boogie-woogie was born 
 Birth of the boogie, birth of the boogie 
 Birth of the boogie, birth of the boogie 
 Birth of the boogie, the boogie-woogie-woogie beat
