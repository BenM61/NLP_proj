it's got its ups and downs
it's got its ups and downs
it's got its ups and downs
it's got its ups and downs
I never heard that noise before

don't be treated like a pound
let currencies go up and down
Mashed Potato, Rocksteady Rub
Mile High Club

it's got its ups and downs
it's got its ups and downs
it's got its ups and downs
it's got its ups and downs
I never heard that noise before

never give up never say die
ignore the fools when they cry
"If this thing fails - nothing at all!"
It won't fail

it's got its ups and downs
it's got its ups and downs
it's got its ups and downs
it's got its ups and downs
