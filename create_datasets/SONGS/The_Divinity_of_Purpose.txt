When the odds were stacked against me
I needed someone by my side
And when the world left no place for me
I needed someone by my side
And when the skies crashed down upon me
I looked for someone by my side
You were there, when no one else was
You showed me what's born doesn't always die

You showed me what's born doesn't always die
Divinity
The divinity of purpose
This is my divinity
The divinity of purpose

Found a way into my thoughts and voiced the true outrage
Found me with feet to edge and helped me step away
Found me with just a whisper left and turned it into screams
And even on my weakest days you helped me find the strength

When the odds were stacked against me
I needed someone by my side
And when the world left no place for me
I needed someone by my side
And when the skies crashed down upon me
I looked for someone by my side
You were there, when no one else was
You showed me what's born doesn't always die

Now I see divinity
The divinity of purpose

I heard the message above discord
Channeling the hate within
Felt the pain of discipline was less than that of regret
Lifted one foot from the grave when the purpose showed its face
And even on my weakest days you helped me find the strength

When the odds were stacked against me
I needed someone by my side
And when the world left no place for me
I needed someone by my side
And when the skies crashed down upon me
I looked for someone by my side
You were there, when no one else was
You showed me what's born doesn't always die

Divinity
The divinity of purpose
This is my divinity
The divinity of purpose
