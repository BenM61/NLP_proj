 I put my arms around you, your body stalls and droops
I give you consolation but there's nothing I can do
Estranged I listen to a voice so scared
Like a martyr from another world, I no longer share

The anguish of a thousand days, the fear of life like everyone
Against there is no chance to swim, you have to simply drift along

Everyday the sting moves deeper, one day it will reach your soul
It's near so close at hand for everyone

No more consolation, no more aggravation,
no more I am making changes for everyone

Your eyes are breaking, the curtain is to drop
You want her here but you never begged before
If I could only scream and silence your voice
I might achieve to wake you up and make you come to a stop
When my world is quiet and no one fills my head
I give it one more thought and put it back to bed

Everyday the sting moves deeper, one day it will reach your soul
It's near so close at hand I hope you understand

No more consultation, no more aggravation,
No more I am making changes for everyone
