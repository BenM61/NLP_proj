I see you looking fly today, I see you shinin', ay
Shout out to my hustlers that grind all day, I see you shinin', ay
I smelt that Gelato from a mile away, I see you shinin', ay
I'll still be a legend if I die today, I see you shinin', ay

I got packs on the trolly
This rap shit's a hobby
I got hitters but I'll still catch me a body
The streets know me for getting P
My daughter had her first Rollie when she was three
I caught a little case, that's a slight loss
'Cause my lawyers like Harvey and Mike Ross
And me and Skrapz couldn't give a f*ck about rap
'Cause even though we're nice, we're just always in the trap
I stay strapped like some lesbo
Fam I only cook packs on the encrows
When you was inside watching Netflix
I was in the crop house wiring electrics
Me and Streetz rep' the Churches like a pope
Tryna impress bitches that will turn a nigga broke
These chicks be obsessed with my P
I just hit then I gone into the M-I-S to the T
It's Nines

I see you looking fly today, I see you shinin', ay
Shout out to my hustlers that grind all day, I see you shinin', ay
I smelt that Gelato from a mile away, I see you shinin', ay
I'll still be a legend if I die today, I see you shinin', ay

I went LV and got dressed today
Did the same thing yesterday
I'm in the newest Jag' when I come through
'Bout to cop my man Likkle T one too
Don't talk money if it's less then a mill'
Free Hydro, hope he gets his appeal
Told my ex-chick that we never could chill
'Cause I got more bitches than Cruella de Vil
Might see me in Dubai with W
Went 'Dam get high in the W
Or I'm in Brum' with some trapstars
I ain't on tour yet, but these packs are
Feeling like I'm 'bout to levitate
Me and Two Bad smoking wedding cake
Hood-star chillin' in the block
10 years from now Steel Banglez will still be on top
It's Nines
