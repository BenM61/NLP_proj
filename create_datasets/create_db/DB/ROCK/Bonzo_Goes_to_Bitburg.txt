You've got to pick up the pieces
Come on, sort your trash, you better pull yourself back together
Maybe you've got too much cash
Better call, call the law
When you gonna turn yourself in?
Yeah, you're a politician
Don't become one of Hitler's children

Bonzo goes to bitburg then goes out for a cup of tea
As I watched it on TV somehow it really bothered me
Drank in all the bars in town for an extended foreign policy
Pick up the pieces

My brain is hanging upside down, I need something to slow me down
Ooh yeah, my brain is hanging upside down and I need something to slow me down

Shouldn't wish you happiness
Wish her the very best
Fifty-thousand dollar dress
Shaking hands with your highness
See through you like cellophane, you watch the world complain
But you do it anyway, who am I, am I to say?

Bonzo goes to bitburg then goes out for a cup of tea
As I watched it on TV somehow it really bothered me
Drank in all the bars in town for an extended foreign policy
Pick up the pieces

My brain is hanging upside down, I need something to slow me down
Ooh yeah, my brain is hanging upside down and I need something to slow me down

If there's one thing that makes me sick it's when someone tries to hide behind politics
I wish that time could go by fast, somehow they manage to make it last

Ooh yeah, my brain is hanging upside down, I need something to slow me down
Ooh yeah, my brain is hanging upside down and I need something to slow me down
Ooh yeah, my brain is hanging upside down and I need something to slow me down
