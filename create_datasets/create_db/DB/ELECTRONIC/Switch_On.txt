With a heartbeat and a breath
As much emotion as a silhouette
Switching on then switching off
Like machinery devoid of love

Switch on switch off
Switch on switch off

With a footstep on the ice
On the other side is paradise
That's the risk we have to take
Or we never move away from base

The hands on the clock were going

Round and round and round and round
Time is crawling on its knees today
Switch on, love flows through your eyes
Switch off, love goes and we lie again
Lie again, lie again oh oh oh!

With a promise written in your heart
Take a mighty jump into the dark
Face the fear, face to face
And the dark becomes a friendly place
