Just give me a June night
The moonlight and you in my arms with all your charms
The moon above and we'll make love.
I'll hold you in full view
Our dreams will come true

Just give me a June night
The moonlight and you
Give me a June night
Give me the moonlight
But mostly give me you

And when you're in my arms, 
With all your charms and the moon above
We're gonna make love, love, love
I'll hold you, hold you, and hold you
Then each little dream that we're dreaming will come true

Just give me a June night
The moonlight and you
Gotta have you, under the moon
Give me a June night
