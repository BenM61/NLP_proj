I get a calling time of day
I beat a lot a, lot of crime away
There's nothing baby I can't take
With that crime I'm gonna make your body ache

It's no kind of big deal
No Carnegie steal
I don't feel like no heel
When I'm born
Said I'm born
Yeah I'm born
And I'm born to kill
Said I'm born
Yeah I'm born
Know I'm born
When I'm born to kill

Jet along and jive my back
Don't tread on my toes and don't skivvy my back
Cheddar bone chops you real fine-fine-fine
Well take a chance honey you can be mine

It's no kind of big deal
No Carnegie steal
I don't feel like no heel
Said I'm born
Know I'm born
Yeah I'm born
When I'm born to kill
Said I'm born
Y'know I'm born
Yeah I'm born
When I'm born to kill

Born to kill
Born to kill
Born to kill
Born to kill
