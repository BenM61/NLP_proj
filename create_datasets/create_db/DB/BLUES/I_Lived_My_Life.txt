I live my life to please myself
Don't worry about nobody else
If you love the life you live, live it all by yourself

I go to work, yes every day
But when it's night I long to play
If you love the life you live, live it every day

I try real hard to do what's right
But all the folks done wrong my life
But I love the life I lived and I try to live it right
