"Aba, daba, daba, daba, daba, daba, dab"
Said the Chimpie to the Monk
"Baba, daba, daba, daba, daba, daba, dab"
Said the Monkey to the Chimp
All night long they'd chatter away
All day long they're happy and gay
Swinging and singing in their hunky, tonkey way
"Aba, daba, daba, daba, daba, daba, dab"
Means "Monk, I love but you"
"Baba, daba, dab," in monkey talk
Means "Chimp, I love you too"
Then the big baboon, one night in June
He married them, and very soon 
They went upon their aba, daba honeymoon
 
"Aba, daba, daba, daba, daba, daba, dab"
Said the Chimpie to the Monk
"Baba, daba, daba, daba, daba, daba, dab,"
Said the Monkey to the Chimp
All night long they'd chatter away
All day long they're happy and gay
Swinging and singing in their hunky, tonkey way
"Aba, daba, daba, daba, daba, daba, dab"
Means "Monk, I love but you"
"Baba, daba, dab," in monkey talk
Means "Chimp, I love you too"
Then the big baboon, one night in June
He married them, and very soon
