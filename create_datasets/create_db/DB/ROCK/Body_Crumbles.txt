Finally recover when the mood is right
Looking up into a neon sky
Child in me takes over, guess it's been too long
Since the last time that I tried to fly

Finally I find when I lose control
Inside my body crumbles
It's like therapy for my broken soul
Inside my body crumbles

All I need's a moment, chance to get away
From the stressfulness of every day
Know if I don't question and I never doubt
Everything is gonna be okay

Finally I find when I lose control
Inside my body crumbles
It's like therapy for my broken soul
Inside my body crumbles

I don't know if I'll be alright
Is it okay to be myself
Why do we always have to fight
Now I know it's alright

Finally I find when I lose control
Inside my body crumbles
It's like therapy for my broken soul
Inside my body

Finally I find when I lose control
Inside my body crumbles
It's like therapy for my broken soul
Inside my body crumbles
