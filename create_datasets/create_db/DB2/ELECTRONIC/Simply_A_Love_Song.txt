Oh
you left me sad and lonely when you walked out in the night

And I know I was the wrong one but I want to put it right.
I don't know what place you're going -
Drop a line and let me know

There is something that I've written just to say I love you sO.

Simply a love-song
I wrote it for you

Won't you listen and give me a chance.
Simply a love-song
you still get the words

You can well give it more than a glance.
Darling
I'm sorry
it's not meant to hurry
don't you tear me apart.
Simply a love-song
it's written for you from my heart.

Don't forget the times of pleasure
how it felt to be in love

AII the moments that we treasure
how it reached the stars above.
Now I've written down my feelings and I'm trying to get through

Don't 'be blind to what you're seeing
'cause this word is meant for you.

Simply a love-song
I wrote it for you
. . .
Simply a love-song
I wrote it for you
. . .
Simply a love-song
I wrote it for you
. . .
