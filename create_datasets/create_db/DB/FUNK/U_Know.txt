Put your hands together
No, like this
Surprise, suprise
Another treat, another trick
This is sweet
Which one's which

For the record, let me state
That I never had a reason to
Break contractually or sever
Relationship with anyone I pleasure

For the playa, let me stop and say-a
That I only paid attention when
When I heard you mention that
He tried to take your treasure
Oh no he didn't

And as a matter of fact
I would have gave you back
But then he had a heart attack
When you made him pack
And said his shack without you would be better

See, what I really mean

See, what I really mean
Is that our future queen
Should never be in frustulation
With this rock and roll machine
Oh no not ever

Yeah, you know
What

You know how much I want you
You know how much I care
When he gone, he know I'm gonna flaunt you
You know, you know, you know

You know how much I want you
You know how much I care
When he gone, he know I'm gonna flaunt you
You know, you know, you know

If you really wanna find the answer
To this Cancer, then we must rewind
Then nevermind the first opinion
You better act surprised

To run this game requires fame
You stole a name and nothing gained
Unless you sacrifice my dear
It's only claim for his dominion

And any question of the deal
Is met with another demand to kneel
And reprimand concealed allegations of you sinning

That's why
Feminine wiles are not surprised
In recognizing that the power of the breasts
Is just a test that you'll be winning

You know how much I want you
You know how much I care
When he gone, he know I'm gonna flaunt you
You know, you know, you know

You know how much I want you
You know how much I care
When he gone, he know I'm gonna flaunt you
You know, you know, you know

You know how much I want you
You know how much I care
When he gone, he know I'm gonna flaunt you
You know, you know, you know
