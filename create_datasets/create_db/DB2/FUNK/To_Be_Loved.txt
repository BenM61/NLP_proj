Someone to care
Someone to share
Lonely hours
And moments of despair

To be loved to be loved
Oh what a feeling
To be loved

Someone to kiss
Someone to miss
When you're away
To hear from each day

To be loved to be loved (to be loved)
Oh what a feeling
To be loved

Some wish to be a king or a queen
Some wish for fortune and fame
But to be truly truly truly loved
Is more than all of these things

Someone to kiss
Someone to miss
When you're away
To hear from each day

To be loved (to be loved)
To be loved (to be loved)
Oh what a feeling
To be loved

To be loved (to be loved)
To be loved (to be loved)
Oh what a feeling
To be loved
