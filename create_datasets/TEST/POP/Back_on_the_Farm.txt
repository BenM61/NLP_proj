The girl leaves
My heart grieves
Mom and Dad can I stay here please
I'm back on the farm again

Oh, no
Well, there goes
A couple dozen
I told you so's
I'm back on the farm again

Yeah, I swear I got a gun underneath the bunk bed
Gonna blow away the rooster if he wakes up the dead
Had to hock the hot rod to pay the credit card
Debt was too easy, life is too hard

Folks Snore
'Till Four
Then you gotta do the morning chores
I'm back on the farm again

HEY!
When I left
The home town
I flipped the birdie at the drug store clowns
I'm back on the farm again

I can't sleep
It's no good
In this peace infested neighborhood
I'm back on the farm again

Yeah, I swear I got a gun underneath the bunk bed
Gonna blow away the rooster if he wakes up the dead
Had to hock the hot rod to pay the credit card
Debt was too easy, life is too hard

Pretty thing
So soft
Meet me later in the hayloft
I'm back on the farm again

The girl's great
My heart's made
I love drifts with a twist of fate
I'm back on the farm again
I'm back on the farm again
