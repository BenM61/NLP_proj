In the chilly hours and minutes of uncertainty
I long to be in the warm halls of your love and mine
To feel you all around me
To take your hand and walk along the sand
Oh, but I may as well try and catch the wind

When sundown pales the sky
I want to hide a while behind your smile
And everywhere I look your eyes I find
For me to love you now would be the sweetest thing
It would make me sing
Yeah, but I may as well try and catch the wind

I'm gonna catch that wind
Help me catch the wind all for you, babe
Just for you, baby

When rain has hung the leaves with tears
I want you near to kill my fear
Help me to leave my blues behind
For standing inside your heart where I want to be
Oh, I long to be, oh, but I may as well try and catch the wind

I'll try and catch the wind
I'm gonna try, oh, to catch the wind
Feel your arms around me, all around me (unverified)
