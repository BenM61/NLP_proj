My dream
Is a wondrous dream
It's the answer too
Wanting only you
 
My dream
Is a true delight
My escape at night
From a world that's blue
 
The world we know
Seems so far away
And where we go
Is for us to say
 
My dream
Is a wealth of joy
No one can destroy
When I dream my dream
It's no common dream
It's a wondrous dream
Dream
