Cross patch how can anyone be so cross
Won't you tumble off your high horse
You know you love to be loved 
Cross patch, if you feel the wind change, they say 
It will make your face stay that way 
And then you'll never be loved 

Cultivate a smile sweet and sunny 
You can catch a fly with honey 
You're actin so spoiled 
Shame, shame, everybody knows your name
Cross patch don't you know it takes two to fight 
Won't you kiss and make up tonight 
You know you love to be loved
