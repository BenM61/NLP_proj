That there, let me break it off
All the pressure that you got, let me take it off
I swear, we're gonna make it hot
Put your hands in the air, don't stop
I'll knock you down like you're Keri
Forget your name like Rihanna
You can run the world, Queen B
Be unthinkable, Alicia
We can go so far if she let go
And I ain't gonna leave without her

This is for the girl that can get down low
The whole club wanna see you go
Ey, shake, shake like you're famous, girl
Head back, lay it down like a Vegas girl
Bass coming down so hard
That little dress breaking every heart
Ey, shake, shake like you're famous, girl
Head back, lay it down like a Vegas girl

Like a Vegas girl

Roll the dice, I've got your number
Hit the jackpot underneath the cover
Intoxicated, you're like a drug, girl
Grab a glass, girl rain tequila
Tequila, tequila, tequila

I'll knock you down like you're Keri
Forget your name like Rihanna
You can run the world, Queen B
Be unthinkable, Alicia
We can go so far if she let go
And I ain't gonna leave without her

This is for the girl that can get down low
The whole club wanna see you go
Ey, shake, shake like you're famous, girl
Head back, lay it down like a Vegas girl
Bass coming down so hard
That little dress breaking every heart
Ey, shake, shake like you're famous, girl
Head back, lay it down like a Vegas girl

Like a Vegas girl

It feels so right every night
Like you're in Vegas, girl
(Like a Vegas girl) in Vegas, girl
(Like a Vegas girl) in Vegas, girl
(Like a Vegas girl) in Vegas, girl

This is for the girl that can get down low
The whole club wanna see you go
Ey, shake, shake like you're famous, girl
Head back, lay it down like a Vegas girl
Bass coming down so hard
That little dress breaking every heart
Ey, shake, shake like you're famous, girl
Head back, lay it down like a Vegas girl
