You're like quicksand, quicksand, pulling me closer closer in my arms.
Can't you see, it's your loving charms,
It's like quicksand sinking me deeper in love with you.
 
The more I find it, the deeper in love I get.
Each time you call me, I feel nothing but happiness.
It's not sane, loving you this way,
But from your heart I can't stay.
