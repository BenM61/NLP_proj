In my home of sand
Outside the city of gold
Well, the wind's so burning hot
But my heart remains so cold
I need to buy myself some answers
But the truth's already been sold

Well, I know how to use a razor
Carve my initials in the light
Yes, I know how to use a razor
Carve my initials in the light
Sometimes in the depth of the dark, baby
I can make everything all right

In my home of sand
Outside the city of gold
Well, the wind's so burning hot
But my heart remains so cold, yes it does
The shelter in your eyes
I dream about it when I die, thirst for it when I cry

In my home of sand
Outside the city of gold
Well, the wind's so burning hot
But my heart remains so cold
The shelter in your eyes
I dream about it when I die, thirst for it when I cry, when I cry

My meal of salt
Upon that table of stone
My meal of salt
Upon that table of stone
Your feat's so sweet
While I thirst here all alone

In my home of sand
Outside the city of gold
Well, the wind's so burning hot
But my heart remains so cold, yes it does
I need to buy myself some aspirin
But the truth's already been sold
