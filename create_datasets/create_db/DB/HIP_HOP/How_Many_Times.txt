You know how I feel about you
And you keep telling me
That he hurt you again
I must be some kind of man

To sit here and listen to you cry
Knowing if he apologizes
You'd be right back with him again
And girl you know you're all that I hope for
And I wish that you could see
See if you really really really
Want to know the truth about it
You should be right here with me baby

How many times will you accept
His apology when I'm telling you
You'll never hear lies from me

How many times will you accept
His apology when I'm telling you
You'll never hear lies from me

If you want to know the truth
I think that he's a fool
To hurt a beautiful woman
Someone as lovely as you

See no matter how much I say I love you
You go running back
For all the love I give
I give and all

The things that he lacks
And girl you know
You're all that I hope for
And I wish that you could see baby

Oh see if you really really really want to
Know
Really want to know the truth about it
You should be right here you should be
Right here
With me and I want you to know baby

How many times will you accept
His apology when I'm telling you
You'll never hear lies from me

Why won't you let me
Take away the pain
Girl it makes me so sad
When you call out his name

'Cause I'm the one
Who make ya grey skie blue
I never perpetrate love
Like he's done to you

How many times will you accept
His apology when I'm telling you
You'll never hear lies from me
