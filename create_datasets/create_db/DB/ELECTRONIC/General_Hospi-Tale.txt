Rock it hard, rock it steady 
Pick yourself up and get yourself ready 
Wave your arms let me hear you yell 
We're gonna rap about General Hospi-Tale 

It started out in Port Charles town 
Where Frank Smith's mob used to hang around 
No one could prove that he was a crook 
Till Luke stole his little black book 

It had names and numbers all in code 
So Luke and Laura had to hit the road 
They had to find the left-handed boy 
Watch their step, they had to be coy 

The gold involved was worth so much 
Others wanted it like Sally and Hutch 
But there's one thing I must confess 
Sally was a man who wore a dress 

Luke kept his cool, he ain't no fool 
He set them both up cold 
Well Sally died, Hutch survived 
And no one got the gold 

"Paging Dr. Noah Drake to ICU to treat a case of heartbreak" 

They keep me waiting 
I don't mind waiting 
Don't call me crazy 
No I'm not lazy 
My day won't go right 
I can't sleep all night 
My hands start shaking 
My knees start aching 
I just can't cope without my soap 

General Hospi-Tale 
General Hospi-Tale 
Umm, number one 
General Hospi-Tale 
You're my worst affliction 
General Hospi-Tale 
You're my favorite addiction 

Monica likes to have her fun 
That is why she had a son 
She told Rick he was the dad 
Soon found out that he'd been had 

"There's one thing that you can give me that Leslie can't and that's passion" 

Alan was the father, of course 
And he won't give Monica a divorce 
Rick wants to get Leslie back 
Heather's havin' an insane attack 

"I'll get Diana Taylor" 

She's not crazy, uh-uh, no never 
She just wants to get Dr. Jeff Webber 
Jeff wants Annie for his wife 
But he might have to wait all of his life 
Cause good girls don't, and Annie won't 
And you all know what I mean 

Amy Vining likes to blab 
Richard Simmons helps fight flab 
Susan's having Alan's baby 
Noah wants Bobbi for his lady 

Well Luke got another job 
The Quartermaines are the brand new mob 
Laura's the receptionist 
What's missing now is the Ice Princess 

"Yes, Luke Spencer, please" 

Diamonds, not gold, are in it this time 
Scorpio, the house of Cassadine 
On and on and on it goes 
How it ends up nobody knows, cause 

They keep me waiting 
I don't mind waiting 
Don't call me crazy 
No I'm not lazy 
My day won't go right 
I can't sleep all night 
If I don't find out 
It blows my mind out 
I just can't cope without my soap
