As the reality of the times take hold
We come to terms with the sadness we bear
Missing the times we never get to share
Wo wo, wo wo, wo wo
Just a few words because we care
Still I got all the memories
Wowo wowo

Say when mi look up ina mi life its plain to see
That its never gonna be the same
Take another step on towards my destiny
But the memories still remain
Deep ina mi brain inna mi soul I hold the key
Said its never gonna be the same
Throughout life and beyond all eternity
Yo, we keep burnin up the flame

Wish I could rewind all the hands of time and bring back
Daddigon a great bredrin of mine, I
Sit and remember all the things that we spoke of
All of the serious reasonings, all di tings we make jokes of
Still cannot believe them took your life away
But those who pull the trigger cannot take away
The covenant the righteous have with Jah Jah
So I know I'll see you again my brother

As the reality of the times take hold
We come to terms with the sadness we bear
Missing the times we never get to share
Wo wo, wo wo, wo wo
Just a few words because we care
Still I got all the memories
Wowo wowo

Fi all the friends and families that have past on
Leaving impressions and memories that will last on
We give thanks fi all the time that we know them
Reminisce them legacy that is what we owe them
Because they helped to make us who we are
So let us never forget and talk it near and far
Bless up Grandpa Lee and Aunt Chris-I
Can't forget you if I try

As the reality of the times take hold
We come to terms with the sadness we bear
Missing the times we never get to share
Wo wo, wo wo, wo wo
Just a few words because we care
Still I got all the memories
Wowo wowo
