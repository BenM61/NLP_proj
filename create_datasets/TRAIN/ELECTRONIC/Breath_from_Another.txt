You sure do got a pretty mouth
Why don't you drop my pants, I'll make you squeal like a pig

Feet in the water is not cold enough, you're not woman enough
Inside your daughter is not warm enough, and you're not woman enough, no

Don't compromise what's gold
For the soul you never sold
For the soul you never sold, no

So I follow you down this road
Well you try but you can't let go
So hold on to years ago

Cold as a lover, don't you want to stay?
Breath from another, and I'll have my way

Inside your daughter
You can never hold what you can't let go
'Cause he wants it so

She'd sell her own mother
Just to make a dime before closing time
When he tells her so

Don't compromise what's gold
For the soul you never sold
For the soul you never sold, no

So I follow you down this road
Will you drive? well you can't let go
So long, two years ago

She said she wanted me to hit it
But I said I wasn't with it
Eyes red thighs spread better come get it
While it's hot the goods I got nevermind my bad credit
Told me how she was soaking wet and I'm the one who wet it
Can't lie I sweat it, but I knew that if I ran through that
It's up the creek I'm headed
Body was there without nor sight nor vision still embedded
But I knew for fucking sure that in the morning I'd regret it
Had to debt it I jetted

He got me hooked 'til I was shooking in the middle of the game
Teary eyes, touch my thighs, future high you'll be my game
Could have kept it but I left it embedded instead of it dissecting me
Free spirit I feared it but steer it to clear it the stress in me
Possessing me the chemistry mother want me in the ministry
Where misery influenced me corruption claiming custody
And I knew this time that I had to feel the pain
It was needed so I'll see what cause deception in this game

Don't compromise what's gold
For the soul you never sold
For the soul you never sold, no

So I follow you down this road
Will you drive? well you can't let go
So hold on to years ago

I'll try to understand
When you're down on your knees in front of a man
I'll try to understand
