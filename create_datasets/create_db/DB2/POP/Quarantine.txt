I've made one mistake in my life
I should have burned Berlin down
And now the drugs are slowly wearing off
And your smile looks more like a frown

I give you freedom - you are alone
Memento mori, infinitum nihil
I'd tear your heart out if you had one
You took Manhattan and now you take

This ship is in quarantine
Under quarantine
This ship is in quarantine
Q-q-q-q-quarantine

Don't wake me unless you come
To say you're leaving for good
The last fruit just fell off that tree
And now you're trying to sell me the wood

I'm watching my own execution
Hear me laughing at the dead
While I'm waiting for a smallprint
A little ? in the head

This ship is in quarantine
Under quarantine
This ship is in quarantine
Q-q-q-q-quarantine

This ship is in quarantine
Quarantine

It's the sequel of the sequel of the sequel
Impress people you don't like
Spending money you don't have

The sequel of the sequel of the sequel
Impress people you don't like
Spending money you don't have

Pretty flames in a rear-view mirror
As I shake the ashes off my shoe
You appear much closer than you really are
But now I'm ? up in something new

This ship is in quarantine
Q-q-q-q-quarantine
This ship is in quarantine
Q-q-q-q-quarantine

This ship is in quarantine
