Thinkin' of blue thunder
Singin' to myself
Thinkin' how fast it moves
Feelin how it turns
I was singin' somethin
Out on Route 128
Thinkin how blue it looks
Singin out aloud
My my blue thunder
My my blue thunder
My my blue thunder
Singin' out aloud
My my blue thunder
My my blue thunder
My my blue thunder
Singin' out aloud
I'll drive so far away
I'll drive so far away
I'll drive so far away
I'll drive so far away
Blue thunder
Blue thunder
Blue thunder
Blue thunder
