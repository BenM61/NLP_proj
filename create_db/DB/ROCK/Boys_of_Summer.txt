Nobody on the road,
Nobody on the beach.
I feel it in the air,
The summer's out of reach.

Empty lake, empty streets,
The sun goes down alone.
I'm driving by your house
Though I know you're not home.

But I can see you,
Your brown skin shining in the sun.
You got your hair combed back
And your sunglasses on, baby.
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone.

I never will forget those nights.
I wonder if it was a dream.
Remember how you made me crazy,
Remember how I made you scream.

Now I don't understand what
Happened to our love.
But, baby, when I get you back,
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of.

But I can see you,
Your brown skin shining in the sun.
I see you walking real slow and you're
Smiling at everyone.
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone.

Out on the road today I saw a Black Flag
Sticker on a Cadillac.
A little voice inside my head said:
"Don't look back, you can never look back."

I thought I knew what love was.
What did I know?
Those days are gone forever.
I should just let them go, but

But I can see you,
Your brown skin shining in the sun.
You got that top pulled down,
And that radio on, baby.

And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong,
After the boys of summer have gone.

I can see you,
Your brown skin shining in the sun.
You got that hair slicked back,
And those Wayfarers on, baby.
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong,
After the boys of summer have gone.
