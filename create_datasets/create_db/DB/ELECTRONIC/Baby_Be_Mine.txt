Mmm...mmm...hmm...

I've been tryin' to tell myself I don't need you
Trying to hold back the feelings I feel for you
Knowing in the end there's no future for you and I
I can't tell no lie

(Baby, be mine) You never really got to know me
(Baby, be mine) I should have said it at the time
(Words left unspoken)
They only gave you a token of my love, ooh

Take a second chance, see what you're missing
I'm just somebody you don't know as well as you think you do
So understand me this time
Baby, be mine

(Baby, be mine) You never really got to know me
(Baby, be mine) I should have said it at the time
(Words left unspoken)
They only gave you a token of my-my love

Ooh...ooh...hoo...
Ooh...
Ooh...hoo...
Hey...hey...hey...hey...

(Baby be mine) Yeah, yeah...oh...yeah, come on, come on
(Baby, be mine) Maybe I should have said at the time
(Words left unspoken)
They only game you a token of my love, my love

(Baby, be mine)
(Baby, be mine) Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby
(Words left unspoken)
They only game you a token of my-my-my-my-my love, hey...hey...yeah...

Come on, you sweet thing
You know I-I need love everyday

No way
(Baby, won't you be mine) Oh, come on , boy
Give me just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit lovin', baby
(Baby, won't you be mine) Won't you be mine, won't you be mine, oh, yeah, yeah

Oh...baby, baby, baby, baby, be mine

(Words left unspoken)
(They only game you a token of my love)
You haven't even begun to know me, boy, oh...ho...ho...yeah

(Baby, be mine) Come on and be my love
Say that you will, say that you will, say that you will
(Words left unspoken)
(They only gave you a token of my love)
My-my-my-my-my-my-my-my-my-my-my-my-my-my-my-my-my-my-my love

(Baby, be mine) Come on, baby
Say that you love me too, say that you'll be my forever love
Always together love
(Words left unspoken) I promise you
