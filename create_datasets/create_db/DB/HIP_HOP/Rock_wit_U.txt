There's no escape on the spell you have placed 
Leaving my heart and my mind 
Foolish am I if I was to try to ever leave you behind 

I wanna rock wit you, come give me all your love 
No matter what we do, I wanna rock wit you 
Wit you and only you
I wanna rock wit you 
I wanna rock wit you 

I'll stay and walk this life wit you 
No matter what we may go through 
Dead broke, no job, no house, no ride 
I'm gonna stay right by your side 

I wanna rock wit you, come give me all your love 
No matter what we do, I wanna rock wit you 
Wit you wit only you, wit you wit only you 
I wanna rock wit you 

Don't question where you're headed to, my love 
Don't be afraid, just believe in love 

I wanna rock wit you 
No matter what we do 
Wit you wit only you 
I wanna rock wit you 

I wanna rock wit you 
No matter what we do 
Wit you wit only you 
I wanna rock wit you 

I wanna rock wit you 
No matter what we do 
Wit you wit only you 
I wanna rock wit you
