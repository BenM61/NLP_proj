We're curious about the one he loves
We're getting carried away with our guesses
What is she like?
We want to know
She'll be the bride of our dear brother

She's very nice
She's very nice
She's very nice
That's all he said
We're curious
Curious
We're curious about the whole affair

She comes from London
(We think that is so romantic)
Maybe she is distantly related to Di
He met her at college
She'll graduate with honors
Maybe our brother fell in love
With her mind

She's very bright
She's very bright
She's very bright
That's what he said
That's news to us
News to us
We're curious about the whole affair

I know our brother
I know what he wants
He wants to make an entrance
In grand style
I know our brother
He's trying to tease us
He knows the wheels are turning
In our minds

We're curious
Curious
We're curious about the whole affair
We're so curious
Curious
We're so curious
And it's so unfair
