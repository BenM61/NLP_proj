I love your face
I love the way you smile at me
An open door that lets the sunshine in
It lights my world, my days
I love your face
I love the look that's in your eyes
You see right through the deepest part of me,
Right down into the heart of me
I love your face

Don't you ever change
You're just right for me
I love all of you
And especially I love your face
I love the message there for me
The greatest love story I ever heard
Without a sound, without a word
I love your face
I love your face
I love your face
