Thinking of you
That's all I seem to do
When you're not here
I long to hold you near

Baby, this time
Together we must bare
Holdin' you close
Takin' time to let you know

Tonight's the night we will share
Turn off the lights, come close to me
Tell me I'm all you ever need
Tell me it's not just a dream
And if it is my heart believes
That you are mine and this is real, oh, oh

Kissing you
Lovin' you all through the night
Share my love
It will be all right

What's better than
A love that's made for two
I cannot count the ways
I feel for you

But you should know
And startin' from today
From this point on
My love is here to stay

Lie close to me, hold on
Let's make our love last all night long
Baby, I'm yours, take all of me, oh, oh
I'll never try to bring you down
My love will always be around
Yes, I'm convinced you're all I need, oh

Kissing you
Lovin' you all through the night
Share my love
Tonight is our night, yeah

Together kissing you
Lovin' you all through the night
Share my love
It will all turn out right

Tonight's the night we will share
Turn off the lights, come close to me
Tell me I'm all you ever need, oh, oh, oh
Tell me it's not just a dream
And if it is my heart believes
That you are mine and this is real, this is real, oh, oh

My baby
Ooh, lady, let me show you that
Let me show you that I love you, baby
Yes, I do
So do it for me and I'll do it for you, honey

You got me in the mood that I'm in
Can't nobody stop me now
Can't nobody save you now
Cause you're gonna love me
