Wakin' up at nine
Looks at his paper
Can't deal with what he sees

All the troubled lives
The talk of the ages
He's crawling back to bed

Don't take a walk outside
Don't make any new friends
He's crawling back to bed

You'd better convince me man
'Cause I, I don't know what I'm doing
You'd better convince me man
'Cause I, I don't know who I'm screwing
You'd better convince me man
'Cause I, I don't know what I'm doing
You'd better convince me man
'Cause I, I don't know who I'm screwing

Callin' all his friends
He's known 'em for ages
Can't deal with what they say

Connective alibis
Cold and contagious
He's crawling back to bed

So cut off the phone lines
Stock up on water
He's crawling back to bed

You'd better convince me man
'Cause I, I don't know what I'm doing
You'd better convince me man
'Cause I, I don't know who I'm screwing
You'd better convince me man
'Cause I, I don't know what I'm doing
You'd better convince me man
'Cause I, I don't know who I'm screwing

You'd better convince me man
'Cause I, I don't know what I'm doing
You'd better convince me man
'Cause I, I don't know who I'm screwing
You'd better convince me man
'Cause I, I don't know what I'm doing
You'd better convince me man
'Cause I, I don't know who I'm screwing

You'd better convince me man
Yessir
You'd better convince me man
Yessir
You'd better convince me man
Yessir
You'd better convince me man
