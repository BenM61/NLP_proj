Ti amo, Ti amo
I love you
Ti amo, Ti amo
I'm crazy for you

Ti amo, Ti amo
I love you (ooh ooh)
Ti amo, Ti amo
I'm crazy for you (aah)

The way you look at me
The way you love me
The way you look around
Can bind my soul

My love is not a game
It's something special (it's something special)
We'll never be the same
Without you boy

Again and again and again
I love you baby

Ti amo, Ti amo? 
The rain is falling down
Over the window (over the window)
My life is cloudy now
Without your love

So do the best you can
To be my lover (to be my lover)
And tell me why you want
To walk away

Again and again and again
I need you baby

Ti amo, Ti amo? 
Only you can make me wonder (aah)
Only you can make me cry (aah)

Ti amo, Ti amo? 
Ti amo, Ti amo? 
Crazy for you
