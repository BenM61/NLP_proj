Baby, got our head down
Baby, got our head down to the ground
Looking for a stranger
Looking for a stranger to love
You got to touch your eyes and crush your teeth
You gotta let go, come with me
Looking for a stranger
Looking for a stranger to love

You say you want it, but
You can't get it in
You got yourself a bad habit for it
Oh, look at you, walking up and down a hall
I say please, say please
You say you want it, but
You can't get it in
You got yourself a bad habit for it
Oh, look at you, walking up and down a hall
I say please
Oh man, oh man, oh man
You know I wish I had it all

Baby, got our head down
Baby, tryin' stand out in the crowd
Looking for a stranger
Looking for 
You know you got to touch your eyes and crush your teeth
You gotta let go, come with me
Looking for a stranger
Looking for a stranger to love

You say you want it, but
You can't get it in
You got yourself a bad habit for it
Oh look at you, walking up and down a hall
I say please, say please
You say you want it, but
You can't get it in
You got yourself a bad habit for it
Oh, look at you, walking up and down a hall
I say please
Oh man, oh man, oh man
You know I wish I had it all
You know I wish I had it all

You say you want it, but
