Sisters, sisters
There were never such devoted sisters
Never had to have a chaperone, no sir
I'm here to keep my eye on her

Caring, sharing
Every little thing that we are wearing
When a certain gentleman arrives from Rome
She wore the dress and I stayed home

All kinds of weather
We stick together
The same in the rain or sun
Two different faces
But in tight places 
We think and we act as one... uh-huh

Those who've seen us
Know that not a thing could come between us
Many men have tried to split us up but no one can

Lord help the mister
Who comes between me and my sister
And lord help the sister who comes between me and my man

Sister
Sister
Sister don't come between me and my man
