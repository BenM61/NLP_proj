Hey what you gonna do on Friday night
Where ya gonna go
We gotta find some action
Baby I'll meet ya at the Paradise
Start a little chain reaction
Hey anybody got a cigarette
Thanks
Anybody here got a dime
I heard that Frankie's got a blue Corvette
She said to call her any time
Anybody got a situation
Is there any place to go

[Chorus]
We want cool kids
Out on the corner
Cool kids
Out on a limb
Cool kids
Looking for someone, looking for something
Looking for somebody
Kids are all right

We go cruising down the avenue
Lean out the window at the stop light
Just trying to shake up the Main Street blues
Try to break out into the hot night
Anybody got a situation
Is there any place to go

[Chorus]

Anybody got an invitation
Is there any place to go
We want cool kids, so cool
We want cool kids
We want cool kids
Cool kids, Out on the corner
Cool kids,  Out tonight
Cool kids
Cool kids, Out on the corner
Cool kids, Out tonight
Cool kids,  Looking for trouble
Cool kids
Cool kids
Cool kids 
Cool kids
I wanna be cool, I wanna be cool
Cool kids
Kids are all right
Cool kids
Out on the corner
Cool kids
