I call your name but you never answer
You bend you head and run away
If it's not true I wish it were
'Cause we still talk but it's even worse

You don't even dare to look
Into my eyes

In the past we used to talk
For so many hours
About things that only
We could understand

Now I wish I could forget all this
By closing my eyes

It never happens this way
Oh it would be too easy
Because there's no easy
Way out in friendship

Yesterday I dreamt
I was swimming in a giant beer mug
And that you were trying
To whisper something in my ear

It never happens this way
Oh it would be too easy
Because there's no easy way out
In friendship

There were sometimes when I thought
We could have patched things up
Now I don't know

Things never happen the way
You thought they would happen anyway
So why try to find an easy
Easy way out in friendship
There's no easy, easy way out

I try to find an easy
Way out in everything
