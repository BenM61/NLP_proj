See moon, see moon, see moon is she
See moon, see moon, see moon to me

How come no one older than me
Ever seems to understand the things I want to do
It will be a seven and I'd never get to heaven
If I filled my head with glue
What's it all to you

See moon, see moon, see moon is she
See moon, see moon, see moon to me

Bobby lived with Patty
But they never told her daddy
What their love was all about
She could tell her lover that he thought
But she never was the type to let it out
What's it all about

See moon, see moon, oh see moon are we
See moon, see moon, see moon are we

How come no one older than me
Ever seems to understand the things I want to do
It will be a seven and I'd never get to heaven
If I filled my head with glue
What's it all to you

See moon, see moon, see moon is she
See moon, see moon, see moon to me

But they never told her daddy
What their love was all about
She could tell her lover that he thought
But she never wanted to let it out
What's it all about

See moon, see moon, see moon are we
See moon, see moon, see moon are we

Well what's it all about

See moon, see moon, see moon are we
See moon are we
