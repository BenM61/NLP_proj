Whisper, whimper on
I won't forget to close your eyes for you
I'll sing before you lie down, down
And push your sleep along
I'll sink below the ground
Find the weeping, wailing calls you echo
And I'll build a house around you
Stir a moat until you drown, down

I'll whisk away your heart sigh and bury it in mine
I'll whisk away your heart sigh and bury it in mine

Only lonely, hidden breath beneath the floor
Only, only, where your tears drip from the drawers
Only lonely, hid the morning from the stars
Only, only, weeping glimmers in the dark

I can hear your back crackin'
Over the sky so you can wear it
Thunder whispered low, so
You could bare it in

I'll whisk away your heart sigh and bury it in mine
I'll whisk away your heart sigh and bury it in mine

Come down, come now back
Carry on, wearily on
Come down, come now back
Carry on, wearily on

Only lonely, hidden breath beneath the floor
Only, only, where your tears drip from the drawers
Only lonely, hid the morning from the stars
Only, only, weeping glimmers in the dark

I'll whisk away your heart sigh and bury it in mine
I'll whisk away your heart sigh and bury it in mine
