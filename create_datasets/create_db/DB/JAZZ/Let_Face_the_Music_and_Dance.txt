There may be trouble ahead
But while there's moonlight
And music and love and romance
Let's face the music and dance

Before the fiddlers have fled
Before they ask us to pay the bill
And while we still have the chance
Let's face the music and dance

Soon, we'll be without the moon
Humming a different tune and then
There may be tear drops to shed
So while there's moonlight
And music and love and romance
Let's face the music and dance
Let's face the music and dance

Soon, we'll be without the moon
Humming a different tune and then
There may be tear drops to shed
So while there's moonlight
And music and love and romance
Let's face the music and dance
Let's face the music and dance
