I can remember stories, those things my mother said
She told me fairy tales, before I went to bed
She spoke of happy endings, then tucked me in real tight
She turned my night light on, and kissed my face good night
My mind would fill with visions, of perfect paradise
She told me everything, she said he'd be so nice
He'd ride up on his horse and, take me away one night
I'd be so happy with him, we'd ride clean out of sight

She never said that we would, curse, cry and scream and lie
She never said that maybe, someday he'd say goodbye

The story ends, as stories do
Reality steps into view
No longer living life in paradise-or fairy tales-uh
No, uh-huh-mmm-mmm

She spoke about happy endings, of stories not like this
She said he'd slay all dragons, defeat the evil prince
She said he'd come to save me, swim through the stormy seas
I'd understand the story, it would be good for me

You never came to save me, you let me stand alone
Out in the wilderness, alone in the cold
My story ends, as stories do
Reality steps into view
No longer living life in paradise-or fairy tales-yes

I don't look for pie up in the sky, baby
Need reality, now, said I
Don't feel the need to be pacified,
Don't cha try
Honey, I know you lied

You never came to save me, you let me stand alone
Out in the wilderness, alone in the cold
I found no magic potion, no horse with wings to fly
I found the poison apply, my destiny to die

No royal kiss could save me, no magic spell to spin
My fantasy is over, my life must now begin

My story ends, as stories do
Reality steps into view
No longer living life in paradise or fairy tales
Eh, hey, hey-ee

Lord have mercy
oooh
Mmm, mmm, oooh-mmm-oh Lord
