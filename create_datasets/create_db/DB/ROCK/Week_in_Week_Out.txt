Is there something more?
Surely there must be
You can't lose everything
So you're quite happy
To live with nothing more
Than a life-long shopping list
You're ticking off all credit
Well you paid for it 
Week in week out
These lucky charms will always let you down
Maybe next week, we'll see
Maybe
You stand in life completely still
Feel really truly unfulfilled
Week in week out 

Where are you going to turn?
When all ambition fails?
Why try any more
If human nature's still?
Fight the hand of God
To touch the lucky few
There's no such thing as God
Or is he lying too? 

Week in week out
These lucky charms will always let you down
Maybe next week, we'll see
Maybe
You stand in life completely still
Feel really truly unfulfilled
Week in week out 

Week in week out
These lucky charms will always let you down
Maybe next week, we'll see
Maybe
You stand in life completely still
Feel really truly unfulfilled
Week in week out
