When we began, you could be so shy
But by the end, you became a different guy
And so I thought your eyes were fixed on me
But now I know, yourself is all you wanna see!

Mirror man, no one could love you
Better than a mirror can, no
Mirror man, I'll make it easier
For you to understand, oh yeah
I think you're falling for you
Someone should tell ya the truth
You see perfection in your reflection
And trouble's coming for you
Mirror man (Mirror man), I wish I could love you
Better than a mirror can!

You would say that I'm your only one,
But I would tell you to walk before you run
And I was right and I realize it now,
Guess I'm attracted to the kind that let me down!

Mirror man, no one could love you
Better than a mirror can, no
Mirror man, I'll make it easier
For you to understand, oh yeah
I think you're falling for you
Someone should tell ya the truth
You see perfection in your reflection
And trouble's coming for you
'Cause all this foolish pride
Makes you the ugly guy
You can try to change,
But you've already lost your way
Why don't you hear what I say?

Yeah, I think you're falling for you
Someone should tell ya the truth, oh no
You see perfection in your reflection
And trouble's coming for you
Mirror man (Mirror man), I wish I could love you
Better than a mirror can! (Ooh)
Ooh
