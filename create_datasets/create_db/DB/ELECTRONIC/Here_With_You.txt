Movin' in slow motion 
everybody needs to dance 
caught up in the moment 
when I see your freaky glance 

I don't want to get started 
just to end up brokenhearted 
don't play me for a fool 
if you want me 
here with you 

I've got my doubts 
'cause I've been here before 
but if you stay with me 
we'll work things out 
we could be together on the floor 

I don't want to get started 
just to end up brokenhearted 
don't play me for a fool 
if you want me 
here with you 

you won't have to be alone 
just promise you'll stay here and 
we'll be together 
forever more 

Baby look at me 
Your music makes me dance 
baby if you can be just a little open-minded 
we'll be together on the floor 

don't want to get started 
just to end up brokenhearted 
don't play me for a fool 
if you want me 
here with you 

you won't have to be alone 
just promise you'll stay here and 
we'll be together 
forever more
