Tears are not enough - oh, you lose a friend
Baby, the more you live - more you love again
Heaven can be cold - heaven can be hot
In the middle of the night - oh you need some love
That's no fantasy - loving me
Oh, that's extasy - next to me
When you understand - you're man
Oh, just calling me

It's nothing but a heartache
Friends and strangers side by side
It's nothing but a heartache
You wasted days and nights

(I told her I never fall in love)

On the wings of love I'll fly to you
A rainbow at midnight - all your dreams come true
Running with the night - running with a touch
Shadows of your smile - are telling me so much
That's no fantasy - loving me
Oh, that's extasy - next to me
When you understand - you're man
Oh, just calling me

It's nothing but a heartache
Friends and strangers side by side
It's nothing but a heartache
You wasted days and nights

Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
You've been born again
Another heart you undercover
Love is not a game

It's nothing but a heartache
Friends and strangers side by side
It's nothing but a heartache
You wasted days and nights
