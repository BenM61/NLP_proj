It's five a.m. when you walk in
This is where your story begins
You say you've been out with the fellas
But the perfume tells me where you've been

Well I knew for sure, when you walked through the door
You had another lover
I read the signs, but I tried to hide
All the pain I felt inside

You can make the story right
I believe what you say though you tell me lies
You can make the story right
It's a fact to me, but it's fiction to you, oh

Same old song, same old story
You keep telling me lies
You think I don't mind that you're unfaithful
But you never see the tears I cry

You've been letting me down, but I can't give you up
I don't wanna let you go
We've spent so much time, trying to make it right
I don't wanna loose the love we have

(You can make the story right)
You can make the story right
(I believe what you say, though you tell me lies)
I believe what you tell me
(You can make the story right)
Oh, oh
It's a fact to me, but it's fiction to you

You've been lettin' me down, but I can't give you up
Don't want another lover
We've spent so much time trying to make it right
I don't wanna loose the love we had
