I have a picture pinned to my wall
An image of you and of me and we're laughing
With love at it all
But look at our life now, we're tattered and torn
We fuss and we fight and delight in the tears
That we cry until dawn

[Chorus]
Hold me now
Warm my heart
Stay with me
Let lovin' start, let lovin' start

You say I'm a dreamer, we're two of a kind
Both of us searching for some perfect world we know we'll never find
So perhaps I should leave here, yeah yeah, go far away
But you know that there's nowhere that I'd rather be

Than with you here today

[Chorus: x2]

You ask if I love you, well, what can I say?
You know that I do and that this is just one of those games that we play
So I'll sing you a new song, please don't cry any more
I'll even ask your forgiveness though I don't know just what I'm asking it for

Oh, oh, hold me now (hold me in your lovin' arms)
Oh warm my heart (warm my cold and tired heart)
Stay with me (Ooh stay with me)
Let lovin' start, let lovin' start

[Repeat: x4]
Oh, oh, hold me now (hold me in your lovin' arms)
Oh warm my heart (warm my cold and tired heart)
Stay with me (Ooh stay with me)
Let lovin' start, let lovin' start
