But tonight we're just gonna call it fiesta
'Cause I don't wanna care where you are

This night will last forever siempre so come on

Come to the party fiesta

Tonight, its the night I'm gonna change the world

I'm looking for a model, chick
About five foot ten with her hair in curls
And a body like Beyonce you put it on me,
Well she's shaking it right
Making me sweat every step of the way
So I know where I'll be by the end of the night, le uh
We get sexy 'cause the sex with me is like a recipe
Songs ? Royality (Yes swaga)
'Cause she's spoiling me
A potential baby keep boiling me
'Cause the party too hot I been MIA

We in the club and we heated it up
Looking for somebody special tonight 'cause I swear
Shorties be eatin' me up
My life is a party
So tonight we're go party and die on the dance floor
And wake up tomorrow in Vegas
'Cause baby that's just what I ask for
See I'm a working man with a working plan
And just workin' baby

And everyone thought I was crazy
But now we're in Giza, in Ibiza, in Miami and Rio
