Want to love ya,
Want to bug ya,
Want to squeeze ya,
Stupid girl

Want to touch ya,
Want to take ya,
Want to (shut ya?),
Stupid Girl

I can't take this, born to break this

She's going away, she's going away,
What's wrong with my life today
She's going away, she's going away,
What's wrong with my life today

Stupid Girl, stupid girl
Stupid girl, stupid girl

I'm a loner
I'm a loser
I'm a winner
In my mind

I'm a bad one
I'm a good one
I'm a sick one
With a smile

I can't take this, born to break this

She's going away, she's going away,
What's wrong with my life today
She's going away, she's going away,
What's wrong with my life today

She's going away, she's going away,
What's wrong with my life today
She's going away, she's going away,
What's wrong with my life today

Stupid girl, Stupid girl
Stupid girl, Stupid girl

She's going away, she's going away,
What's wrong with my life today
She's going away, she's going away,
What's wrong with my life today

Stupid girl, stupid girl
Stupid girl, stupid girl
