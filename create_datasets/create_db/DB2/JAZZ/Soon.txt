Soon, my dear, you'll never be lonely,
Soon, you'll find I live for you only.
When I'm with you who cares what time it is
Or what the place or what the climate is?

Oh! Soon, our little ship will become sailing
Home through every storm, never failing,
The day you're mine this world will be in tune,
Let's make that day come soon.

Oh! Soon, our little ship will become sailing home
Through every storm, never failing,
The day you're mine this world will be in tune,
Let's make that day come soon.
