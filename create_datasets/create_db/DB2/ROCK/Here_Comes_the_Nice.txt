He knows what I want he's got what I need
He's always there if I need some speed

You know you should meet the man (the man)
The man gonna help you all he can
You don't money to be wise

Here come the nice, looking so cool
Everyone knows the nice is no fool
He'll bring you up, and show you around
He's always there if your feet hit the ground

The man gonna teach you all he can
You don't need money to open your eyes
