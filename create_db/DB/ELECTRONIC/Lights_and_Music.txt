This is why we woke too late
For your birthday
Secrets that we held that day
Will be kept straight

All your friends have gone away
So let's celebrate
With holding hope open for the one
Making new way

Tell me what you hope to say
On your birthday
Secrets that we held that day
Will be kept straight

Everyone will be dismayed
If your promise breaks
But you'll be back again to say
Who you like best

Lights and music
Are on my mind
Be my baby
One more time

Lights and music
Are on my mind
Be my baby
One more time

Fading with the color you
Seeing my face
Cold and crystal you can hide
But your tears race

I?ll be waiting by your time
Put your dreams away
With holding hope, hoping for the one
Making new way

Lights and music
Are on my mind
Be my baby
One more time

Lights and music
Are on my mind
Be my baby
One more time
