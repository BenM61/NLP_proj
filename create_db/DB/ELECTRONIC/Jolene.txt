Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene Can
Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of Spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene

He talks about you in his sleep
And there is nothing I can do to keep
From cryin' when he calls your name Jolene
And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me
Jolene

(*)Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm beggin' of you
Please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him
Just because you can

You could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me, Jolene
I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
Whatever you decide to do, Jolene

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm beggin' of you
Please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him
Just because you can

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm beggin' of you
Please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him
Even though you can, can, can, can
