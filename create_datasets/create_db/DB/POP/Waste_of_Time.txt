Snow fall some how it's doesn't melt boy when it hits you, why?
All this life I've been drowned by confusion.
What you want is slowly losing one love
You say you don't know you were gonna
Break my heart on the winter night

It's that what you want is
Say the words and I'll be gone now.
Show you I was gonna lose you to the blue.

Where is the love we had? Love we had?
Where is the love we had? Ooh
What a waste of time.

Why does it hurt so bad? Hurt so bad
Why do you always make me cry? Ooh
What a waste of time.

You said I was your beat, what the f*ck!
Oh what a waste of time
Now I am just your bitch, what the f*ck!
Ooh what a waste of time

Why this storm how walking on the glass of your broken vows?
Well what I say we're a straight fooled by youth OK

What you wanted is slowly losing one love
Uh, I told you you were gonna take a run on a winter night.
Is that really what you wanted?
Say the words say the words
I'd a told you i was gonna losing you to what is cruel

Where is the love we had? The love we had?
Where is the love we had? Ooh
What a waste of time.

Why does it hurt so bad? Hurt so bad
Why do you always make me cry? Ooh
What a waste of time.

Where is the love we had? The love we had?
Why do you always make me cry? Ooh
What a waste of time.
