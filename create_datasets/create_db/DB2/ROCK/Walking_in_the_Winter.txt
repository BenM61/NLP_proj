We went walking in the winter
It was the coldest
Time of year

It's where I handed you a letter
You turned around
I disappeared

It said someday
I'll find my way
And we'll go walking
In the winter

It's so hard to make a living
When the world
Is so unkind
But it's not something
That you're given
It's something that
You've got to find

It said someday
I'll find my way
And we'll go walking
In the winter

It's o.k. to close your eyes
Those silver sailing ships
Go sailing by
It's all your mind
It's gonna be alright
This time

(Instrumental)

Seasons change
Into summer
Fires burning in the dark
I hope sometimes
You read my letter
And know I had to
Play my part

It said someday
I'll find my way
And we'll go walking
In the winter
