Just for you
Just for you
Just for you
My love
Whoa-whoa-whoa for you
Just for you
My love

Whoa yes my dear, I finally realized
I finally realized that it's just for you

When you see me workin' all night long
Workin' till my strength is gone, it's for you
Whoa yes it is
I finally realized it's all for you, yeah

When you see me workin' all the day
Workin' all of my strength away, it's for you
Whoa, yes it is
I finally realized it's all for you

Just for you, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Could it be for you?
Just for you
Just for you
Whoa, just for you, now

Yes my dear, I finally realized
I finally realized that it's just for you

When you see me workin' all the day
Workin' all of my strength away, it's for you
Whoa, yes it is
I finally realized it's all for you, yeah

When you see me spending all of my money
Just to give you a good time honey, it's for you
Whoa I finally realized, I finally realized that it's just for you

It's for you, for nobody else but you, my love
It's for you
Sweetheart, I know it's for you, whoa
It's for you now
Yes my dear, I finally realized
I finally realized that it's just for you

Mmm, whoa whoa, it's just, for you
