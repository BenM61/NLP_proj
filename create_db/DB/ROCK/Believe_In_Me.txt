If you believe everything has a reason
If you believe that what you've seen will unfold
If you believe that everybody needs to shake it loose
That everyone will rock and everybody will roll, yeah

If you believe everyone is the future
If you believe that nothing ever goes wrong
If you believe that deep down inside you're falling apart
Know that everybody's weak and everyone can be strong

Yeah, believe in me
Believe in me
Believe in me
Believe in me

Say what you want
And take the best of me and everyone else
Oh, yeah
Say what you want
It's all the same to me
Look out for yourself

Believe in me
Believe in me
Believe in me
Believe in me
Believe in me
Believe in me

Say what you want
[Say what you want]
Ah, ah, la la la la
