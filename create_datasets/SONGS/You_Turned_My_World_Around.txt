Walkin' lonely streets, lookin' for a sign
Livin' lonely dreams, life with no design
Like lonely people do, livin' in the past
Only findin' love that didn't last
Then the shadows of my life felt the sun and saw your face
As your love fell all around me making perfect time and space

Then you turned my world around
When you held out your hand
You turned my world around
Bringin' love to a lonely man

Now I walk with you, Spring has come at last
No more lonely dreams, they're all in the past
And each day knows the joy that sharing love can give
Love's the only life that we can li-I've
Now the shadows of my life feel the sun, I see your face
As your love falls all around me making perfect time and space

And you turned my world around
When you held out your hand
You turned my world around
Bringing love to a lonely man
