Girl of my dreams
Things are as bad as they seem
She is only 16
That's why she's only a dream
Woman of my dreams
Lives right down my street
Has a daughter who's 16
That's why she's only a dream

What do I do this for
Got to get out some more
Go down to the grocery store
Meet someone I'll adore
Someone who'll make me laugh
Someone to be my better half
Keep me warm under the sack
Share with me my midnight snack

Job of my dreams
Things are as bad as they seem
Working where I did at 14
Making less pay it seems

What do I do this for
Got to get out some more
Go down to the grocery store
Meet someone I'll adore
Someone who'll make me laugh
Someone to be my better half
Keep me warm under the sack
Share with me my midnight snack

House of my dreams
Things are as bad as they seem
My parents' house I'll stay for free
Till I'm at least 43
