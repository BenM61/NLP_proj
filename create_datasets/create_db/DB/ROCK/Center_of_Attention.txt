You want your independence 
But you won't let me let you go 
You wanna test the waters 
And leave it on the empty shores 

But I'll take my time if you want to 
And I'll give you whatever you need 
And I'll wait a lifetime to give it to you 
Give it to you 

You think that you?re the sun 
The whole world revolves around you 
The center of attention 
And everything is drawn to you 

But I'll take my time if you want to 
And I'll give you whatever you need 
And I'll wait a lifetime to give it to you 
Give it to you 

I would wait a lifetime 
And I would wait for you 
I would wait a lifetime 
And I would wait for you 

But I'll take my time if you want to 
And I'll give you whatever you need 
And I'll wait a lifetime to give it to you 
Give it to you
