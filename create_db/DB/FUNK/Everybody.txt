We have seen some things in our lives
We've had some long and sorrowed roads
That's how I know it's alright to cry

Go on and ease the heavy load
Pray hard, walk tall, do right
Find love, hold on, for life

Lord I know that you are there
An I feel a burning in my bones
Free us from the lion's den
And take us home

Everybody needs love in their life
Everybody needs a little sun to shine
Goin' let love come inside your life
Shine down on me, on me

The Shepard and his angels guard our lives
Go on joy comes early morn
The ways of man will sure subside
Cant walk away cause hear comes love
Smiling, faithful, alright
Find love hold on for life

Lord I know that you are there
I feel a burning in my bones
Free us from the lions den
And take us home
Everybody needs love in their life,
Everybody needs a little sun to shine
Goin' and let love come inside your live
Shine down on me, on me.

Lord rain down on me
And let your joy ease my pain
Take me from this lion's den
And make me smile again yeah
Everybody needs love in their life
Everybody needs a little sun to shine
Goin' let love come inside your life
Shine down on me, on me

Everybody needs love in their life
Everybody needs a little sun to shine
Goin' let love come inside your life
Shine down on me, on me
