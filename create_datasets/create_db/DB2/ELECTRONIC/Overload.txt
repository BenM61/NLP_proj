Know that I've been waiting for so long
You're all that I see
I can't stop the feeling oh no
It's kicking over me

Feel the mercury rising
I feel your baseline bumping
Hear it in your rhythm
You got my heart beat pumping

Oh I can't stop it
No I can't control it
Can you feel it overloading?
Oh overloading, heh
You can't stop it
No you can't control it
Can you feel it overloading
Oh overloading, heh
