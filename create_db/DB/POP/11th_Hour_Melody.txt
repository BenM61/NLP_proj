[Chorus:]
The 11th hour is here
The hour of parting dear

We have one hour my love
For at midnight we must part
Soon my love
You'll obey your wandering heart
Thrill my lips
As you've always thrill them
'Till my lips
Are mine no more

Hold back the time, my love
The 11th hour is here
Hold the time
While I'm holding back a tear
I'll be yours
'Till the last eternity
Darling, come
Back to me

The 11th hour is here
The hour of parting dear

I'll be yours
'Till the last eternity
Darling, come
Back to me

The 11th hour is here
The hour of parting dear
Come back
