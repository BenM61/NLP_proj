Send it up
Send it through
Send it right back, to you
Send it up
Send it through
Send it right back, to you

Your inner view, to me
Is something that I, do desire
Struggling to see, a new
Something that I, fantasize
So I'm sending

Send it up
Send it through
Send it right back, to you
Send it up
Send it through
Send it right back, to you

You can't disguise your emotions
You know that I see, in your eyes
You soul's me, your soul's somethin' that I, feel inside
(run, run, run, run, run) if I run, lord only knows how far
That I and I will fall behind
Gotta find a better place, find a better space
So that I, so my life may be the reason why

Hold on, be strong, for your own
Move on, b4 long, you'll get home
If your feeling insecure
You can be sure
Ho
Even if it take forever and a day for me to do
I gotta send it on, to you
Tell me what will I do
Send it right back to you
