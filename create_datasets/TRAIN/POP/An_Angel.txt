I wish I had your pair of wings
Had them last in my dreams 
I was chaising buterflies 
Till the sunrise broke my eyes 

Tonight the sky has glued my eyes 
'Cause what they see's an angel hive 
I've got to touch that magic star 
And greet the angels in their hive 

Sometimes I wish I were an angel 
Sometimes I wish I were you 

Sometimes I wish I were an angel 
Sometimes I wish I were you 

Oh, sweet honey from above 
Pour it all over me sweet love 
And while you're flying around my head 
Your honey kisses keep me fed 

I wish I had your pair of wings 
Just like last night in my dreams 
I was lost in paradise 
Wish I'd never opened my eyes 

Sometimes I wish I were an angel 
Sometimes I wish I were you 

Sometimes I wish I were an angel 
Sometimes I wish I were you 

But there's danger in the air 
Tryin' so hard to be unfair 

Danger's in the air 
Tryin'so hard to give us a scare 
But were not afraid 

Sometimes I wish I were an angel 
Sometimes I wish I were you 

Sometimes I wish I were an angel 
Sometimes I wish I were you 

Oh I wish I were you

Sometimes I wish I were an angel 
Sometimes I wish I were you 

Wish I were you

Oh I wish I were you
