From the start through all time
Here upon the wind
Disorder reigned hand in hand with Spring
Earth and the fire

Air and the water
Molded the sea and landscape
Moving, flowing with no seeming purpose
Endlessly changing

Survival
Spring into Summer
Time for reflection
Time to grow

World full of meaning
Place rearranging
Face ever changing
For all our lives

These are our roots and it's our way
We grow, we reap and sow
We reap and sow the seasons of our day

Within the heart of all things born that day
The Autumn scene brings the Winters way
Colors are shading
Misting and fading

Turning toward
Changes, living
Each time the past and the future
Holding together

Tomorrow
Winter to Springtime, a season for planning
Time to learn
World full of stillness

World ever waiting
Anticipating
For all of our lives
These are our roots, and it's our way

We grow, we reap, and sow
We reap and sow the seasons of our day

We fall, while aiming so high
We crawl, flying
Man has North, South, East and West
Man has, trying
A song for all seasons through

Man has North, South, East and West
Man has music
Man has North, South, East and West
Man makes music
A song for all seasons through

Song for all seasons
A song for all our time
We'll have a song for all the seasons through
