Mama mama
You're a whiz and a scholar too
Mama open up the room lock
Sip sip
I'm going to the moon dock
He gives to me
Buckles off shingles
Off a cockleshell on norway basin
Coke and tuna
Boots and roses from russia
Now I'll live and die and rise
With my captain
Mama say go
Meet me captain saint lucifer
Darlin' I'll be there
Don't you know
Meet me captain saint lucifer
Darlin' I'll be there
Don't you know
Now don't you know I love you
Meet me captain saint lucifer
La la la la la la la la
Oo I love you 
Love you I do
Mama mama you're a whiz and a scholar too
Mama I'm at anchor in your glow now
Sip sip
Even as I go now
He gives to me
Buckles off shingles
And a jangle from a congo love chase
Early bloomers made of earth and love lace
Now I'll live and die and rise
With my captain
Mama be happy
Meet me captain saint lucifer
Darlin' I'll be there
Don't you know
Meet me captain saint lucifer
Darlin' I'll be there
Don't you know
Gutters in stacks 
Is where I come from
Buckles off a poverty drum
Oh my love trumpet soul
Tell gabriel
To tell the captain 
Thank you baby
You're my baby now
