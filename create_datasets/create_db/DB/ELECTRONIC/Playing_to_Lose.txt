I'm stumbling home again, I always have too much
Don't know how but I'm standing
I never can understand it

I can't keep my head on straight, I'm useless at your touch
You know just had to leave me stranded
Don't know why I even try, try, try

You're bulletproof, ain't no getting to you
I can't breakthrough anything that I do
It's like I'm playing to lose
You're dangerous, don't know which way to move
I should give up when I give in to you
It's like I'm playing to lose

Eyes open, broken down, I'm hopeless at your door again
I say that I'm cold just to get in
The story it's old, but it don't end

Your twice speak miles and tells me to go, but stay instead
It's like you've been slipping in to my head
Don't know why I even try, try, try

You're bulletproof, ain't no getting to you
I can't breakthrough anything that I do
It's like I'm playing to lose
You're dangerous, don't know which way to move
I should give up when I give in to you
It's like I'm playing to lose

You're bullet, bullet
You're bullet, bulletproof
You're bullet, bullet

I can't win, I just can't win
I can't win, I just can't win
I can't win, I just can't win

You're bulletproof, ain't no getting to you
I can't breakthrough anything that I do
It's like I'm playing to lose
You're dangerous don't know which way to move
I should give up when I give in to you
It's like I'm playing to lose

You're bulletproof, ain't no getting to you
I can't breakthrough anything that I do
It's like I'm playing to lose
You're dangerous don't know which way to move
I should give up when I give in to you
It's like I'm playing to lose
