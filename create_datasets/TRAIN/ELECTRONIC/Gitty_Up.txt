Gitty up babe

You can buy that
Feel the bass and the hi-hats
You can buy that
Feel the bass and the hi-hats

I'm-a make you bounce till your hip hurts
Make you work
Sweat till you drench your blouse and your skirt
And I'm-a freak you till you pass out
Pull your cash out, baby tear your back out
Keep bangin'
Ho, B.L.A.Q. make you say "Ho"
S and P, chi-ca, chi-co
Everybody put your hands in the sky
Gitty up, gitty up, that's right

Gitty up baby (Gitty up, gitty up)
Say what?  Gimmie all that you got
Baby don't stop
Keep it comin' strong, make it hot, say what?
Gitty up baby (Gitty up, gitty up)
Say what?  Gimmie all that you got
Baby don't stop
Keep it comin' strong, make it hot, say what?

Gitty up baby, I'm-a take you for a ride
It makes your soul wild when I release vibes
Freak ya down till your asthma hit ya
Salt, non-stop styles, lift ya
Make you wanna get your stash
Blowin' like the wind, no need, got my own ends
Player-haters never win cuz I'm a ball to the end
Send chill up your skin Poppie
Who the fake?  Not me
Can't take what I got, can't stop me
Feel the vibe, ride bass slide
Yo, can't fight it ho
Let it flow and move, show and prove
We can do this, shake your groove thing
Hold tight, ain't nothin' to this
Wanna get down with skills
Romance and no frills?
Uh, it feels ill, don't it?

Gitty up baby (Gitty up, gitty up)
Say what?  Gimmie all that you got
Baby don't stop
Keep it comin' strong, make it hot, say what?
Gitty up baby (Gitty up, gitty up)
Say what?  Gimmie all that you got
Baby don't stop
Keep it comin' strong, make it hot, say what?

I keep it hot like a block full of hustlers
Who can make it blaze like us?
Bless you to death, wanna freak me from the back?
(Girl, don't even play like that)
Keep it comin' strong, give me all that you got
(Chi-co, true baller don't stop)
I throw it like a pitcher, let my sex appeal hit ya
Game so sharp that it split ya
Playa what, keep-a stylin' 
(I ain't been hooked since Ewing was a Hoya)
Can't nobody do it this tight
Pep be the bomb, that's right
Look at all the playas tryin' to get with me, sit with me
Yo, it ain't sh... to me
I'm-a party till I see the sunrise
S to the P, the party live
Keep it comin' baby

Gitty up baby (Gitty up, gitty up)
Say what?  Gimmie all that you got
Baby don't stop
Keep it comin' strong, make it hot, say what?
Gitty up baby (Gitty up, gitty up)
Say what?  Gimmie all that you got
Baby don't stop
Keep it comin' strong, make it hot, say what?

Gitty up baby
Gimmie that S and P, that sweet and funky stuff
Gimmie that S and P, that sweet and funky stuff
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
Give me the funk, that sweet... Yo-ho!

S to the P-I-N, spare with a rella
Ain't no fella, well a...
Freak your body, keep the party hot
Gimmie all that you got and it don't stop
When it moves down on me, put your grooves down, homie
Can't lose now, come on
Can you work it down to the bone?
Boy, you actin' like you grown
Before I take you home, (watch out) you better move

Gitty up baby (Gitty up, gitty up)
Say what?  Gimmie all that you got
Baby don't stop
Keep it comin' strong, make it hot, say what?
Gitty up baby (Gitty up, gitty up)
Say what?  Gimmie all that you got
Baby don't stop
Keep it comin' strong, make it hot, say what?
