Where the blue moons shines
Where the tears melt ice
In a sea of guilt
By the fallen stars
Lonely chimes, sing of pain
There's a storm, only love remains

I been stung by a star seed honey
He shone love like a lightning honey
I been hit by a star seed honey
His love burns like a lightning honey
I'm right here I'm your star crossed lover
I lie here like a starless lover
I'll die here as your phantom lover
I never learn
I never learn
