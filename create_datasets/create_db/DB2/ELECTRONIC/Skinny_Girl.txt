I'm kinda rusted, everyone's noticed
Salty and edgy, it's not my fault
I wear a costume to make up for broken
I wear a ribbon for the problems I've solved

The habit is compelling, treat it like addiction
The rise and fall of conviction
The peace and shame of giving in
I've got a name it's all I have

I'm a skinny wire radio tower
I believe there's something more
I'm a silver jet just passing over
I believe there's something more

I'm covered with choices, it's not becoming
This way or that one, I can't decide
I've got a name, it's all I know
