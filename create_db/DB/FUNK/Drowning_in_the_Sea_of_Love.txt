[Chorus]
I've been down one time,
And I've been down two times,
But now I'm drowning, drowning in the sea of love.

I've been here so very long,
I've lost all my directions.
But, baby, when you came my way,
I thought I had found perfection.
But a strong wind came into my life,
It surely took me by surprise,
I can't seem to control these tears flowing from my eyes.

[Chorus]
I've been down (one time) one time,
I've been down (two times) two times,
But I'm drowning, drowning in the sea of love.

You know that I depend on you,
For our love's an obligation.
But now that you deserted me,
I'm in desperation.
But I'm in the middle of a bad love storm,
It really took me by surprise.
I look around and all I see is water coming over me.

[Chorus]
I've been down (one time) one time,
I've been down (two times) two times,
But I'm drowning, hear me, drowning in the sea of love.

[Chorus]
I've been down one time,
And I've been down (two times) two times,
But now I'm drowning, drowning in the sea of love.

Drowning, you know I'm drowning.
(Watch your love, watch your love, yeah-hey)
(Watch your love, watch your love)
I'm going down for the last time!

Drowning in the sea of love - drowning,
Drowning in the sea of love - drowning,
Drowning in the sea of love - falling,
Drowning in the sea of love - falling,
Drowning in the sea of love,
Drowning in the sea of love,
Drowning in the sea of love,
Drowning in the sea of love.

Watch your love, watch your love,
Watch your love, watch your love,
Watch your love, watch your love.

Drowning in the sea of love - drowning,
Drowning in the sea of love - drowning,
Drowning in the sea of love - falling,
Drowning in the sea of love - falling.

One time.
Two times.
Drowning, drowning in the sea of love.
One time.
Two times.
I'm going down two times.
(Drowning) drowning, drowning in the sea of love.
I've been down (one time) one time,
And I've been down (two times) two times,
But I'm drowning, drowning in the sea of love.

Whoa!

Drowning in the sea of love, I'm drowning!
Drowning in the sea of love, I'm falling!
Drowning in the sea of love, yeah!
Drowning in the sea of love,
Drowning in the sea of love,
Drowning in the sea of love.
