She was insatiable, you know the type 
And she was young, but she was ripe 
And she was vicious, and she took a bite
Baby don't wanna feel this pain anymore 
I've got a message, put it through emergency 
I wanna hear it on the radio tonight
Calling all girls, If you're looking for love (You got it) 
Calling all girls, If you're looking for a hot time 
Calling all girls, If you're looking for fun 
Calling all girls, If you're looking for a good time tonight
Seems all the good girls are home in bed 
We're gonna party to raise the dead 
I'm gonna love that girl right out of my head 
Baby don't wanna feel this pain anymore 
I've got a message, put it through emergency 
I wanna see it on the video tonight
Calling all girls, If you're looking for love 
Calling all girls, If you're looking for a hot time 
Calling all girls, If you're looking for fun 
Calling all girls, If you're looking for a good time tonight
Calling all girls, calling all girls 
Calling all girls, calling all girls 
Calling all girls, calling all girls
Baby don't wanna feel this pain anymore 
I've got a message, put it through emergency 
I wanna hear it on the radio tonight
Calling all girls, If you're looking for love (You've Got It) 
Calling all girls, If you're looking for a hot time 
Calling all girls, If you're looking for fun 
Calling all girls, If you're looking for a good time tonight
Calling all girls, If you're looking for love 
Calling all girls, If you're looking for a hot time 
Calling all girls, If you're looking for fun 
Calling all girls, If you're looking for a good time tonight
Calling all girls, If you're looking for love 
Calling all girls, If you're looking for a hot time 
Calling all girls, If you're looking for fun 
Calling all girls, If you're looking for a good time tonight
