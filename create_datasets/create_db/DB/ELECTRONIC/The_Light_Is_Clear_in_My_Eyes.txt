I couldn't handle the notion
I couldn't handle the need
And my mind is appalling me

We lived under a knife
We wanted so much to die
The dissolution is calling me

An easy out

Try on someone to be
Always alone and free
Afraid and cruel
I'm such a fool

I crashed over the line
Brought dying to mind
Took a second to fall
The light's clear in my eyes
I might try to believe
You want nothing from me
Last vestige to go
And now i'm dying to bleed

Oh someone to be
Always alone and free
Afraid and cruel
I'm such a fool
And who are you
To see me through?

The light's clear in my eyes
