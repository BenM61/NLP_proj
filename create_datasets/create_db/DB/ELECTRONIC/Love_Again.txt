These days I'm afraid of me
There's fire where my heart should be
My cold feet and as weak
My mouth doesn't dare to speak
'Cause I've been looking too hard for something,
Looking too hard for something 
Giving it all for nothing,
Trying too hard to love again

Uh uh uh eh eh eh
Looking for, looking for to love again
Uh uh uh eh eh eh
Looking for, looking for to love again

In light of reality, 
The truth it's too good to be
Looking too hard for something,
Looking too hard for something 
Giving it all for nothing,
Trying too hard to love again

(x3)
Uh uh uh eh eh eh
Looking for, looking for to love again
Uh uh uh eh eh eh
Looking for, looking for to love again

Maybe if I stop lookin'
Take back all that I've put in
Elevate and built you will
Maybe if I, maybe if I stop

(x4)
Uh uh uh eh eh eh
(I don't know where to start at)
Looking for, looking for to love again
Uh uh uh eh eh eh
(I don't know where to start at)
Looking for, looking for to love again
(I don't know where to start at)
