Goodbye jungle Jim,
Goodbye Mary Lou,
You look just like Bugs Bunny,
I was once in love with you.
Goodbye Auntie Flo,
I hope you don't get sore,
I don't believe the stories that you read me any more.

Goodbye Major Tom,
Goodbye Trapper John,
You better check your pockets,
Just in case your money's gone.
When you're tired of being clever,
And you're tired of being afraid,
You might just smell your flowers 
And not the money that you made.

I am happy to be me,
That's all,
I'm happy to be,
I am an absolute nobody,
But I'm happy and I'm free.
I'm sitting on a rock 
Up on a mountain in Nepal,
I'm happy to be nothing,
And I'm the happiest of all.

Mister Magoo,
Tell Betty Boo,
I bought most of your records,
But I stopped at number two.
When you're tired of being clever,
And you're tired of being afraid,
You might just smell your flowers 
And not the money that you made.

I am happy to be me,
That's all,
I'm happy to be,
I am an absolute nobody,
But I'm happy and I'm free.
I'm sitting on a rock 
Up on a mountain in Nepal,
I'm happy to be nothing,
And I'm the happiest of all
