Jack O'Diamonds, on the move

Jack O'Diamonds, one-eyed knave
On the move, hits the street
Bumps his head, on the ground
Well, he's a scout, you're born to lose
Shouldn't stay

Jack O'Diamonds is a hard card to play

Jack O'Diamonds, yeah Jack O'Diamonds
This one-eyed prince, wears a ?single love?
Oh sure, he's not that lovely
Jack O'Diamonds broke my hand
Left me here to stand

Jack O'Diamonds is a hard card to land

Jack O'Diamonds is a hard card 
Jack O'Diamonds is a high card 
Jack O'Diamonds is a hard card 
But it ain't hard enough

Jack O'Diamonds can open for riches
Jack O'Diamonds but then it switches
Colour by picture but it's only a ten

Jack O'Diamonds, yeah Jack O'Diamonds

Jack O'Diamonds is a hard card to play

Jack O'Diamonds, yeah Jack O'Diamonds
This one-eyed prince, wears a single love
Oh sure, he's not that lovely
Jack O'Diamonds broke my hand
Left me here to stand

Jack O'Diamonds is a hard card to play

Jack O'Diamonds is a hard card 
Jack O'Diamonds is a high card 
Jack O'Diamonds is a hard card 
But it ain't hard enough

Jack O'Diamonds can open for riches
Jack O'Diamonds but then it switches
Colour by picture but it's only a ten
Jack O'Diamonds
