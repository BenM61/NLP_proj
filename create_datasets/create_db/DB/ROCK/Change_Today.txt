Well, ain't we gonna let us know what is going on?
Yeah, people lie and so will I, and I still wonder why
I wonder why, why people lie? Why people lie, I wonder why?

Well, don't ask about tomorrow, tomorrow's just the same
Yeah, people die and so will I but I still wonder why
I wonder why, why people die? Why people die, I wonder why?

Well, why can't they just tell us what will happen?
No they shouldn't have to lie
Well, why can't they just tell us what will happen?
The future lies right through their eyes
Right through their eyes, right through their eyes

Machine moves on until you stop it
Yeah, you'll be unseen, you're riding atop it
You're too young to kill and you're too old to drop it
So change today, change today, 'cause we ain't gonna forfeit
I wonder why, why people lie? Why people die, I wonder why?
