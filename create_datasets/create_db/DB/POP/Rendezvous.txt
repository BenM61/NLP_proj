I'm not school girl Juliet
Who falls in love each night 
But I think I've fallen on first sight

Know we only met just yesterday 
I barely know your name 
But I think I love just the same 

I haven't stop thinking about our date tonight
I hope you haven't changed your mind
I haven't stop dreaming about you hold me tight
Tonight all this time 

We got a rendezvous tonight at half past eight 
We got a rendezvous now don't forget our date
Na na na rendezvous just me and you!


My head is swimming bells are ringing
I can't move at all 
Day is dragging night will never fall

I know we only met just yesterday 
In the small cafe 
Since that moment I've been walking tall
