All through my life I've seen so many smiling faces come and go some of them have 
Tryed to bring my spirit low
'Cause they see my hearts devoted to the one who always knows 
Seem to hold my hand so tight or let it go 
I hear people talkin' there's no way I'm stoppin' 
Empty words won't change my love for 

I'm gonna stay true I don't want someone knew 
I'm gonna stay true to you 
I'm gonna stay true this is my attitude 
I'm gonna stay true 'cause nobody else will do 

Always tryin' to convince me that your love is just a lie, 
That I might as well be listenin' to the sky 
Saying you won't really love me when you know what's deep inside, 
You'll just go 'cause your 
Above the sacrifice 
One thing that I know of 
They can't steal your love 
Doubting words won't change my point of view 

I'm gonna stay true I don't want someone knew 
I'm gonna stay true to you 
I'm gonna stay true this is my attitude 
I'm gonna stay true 'cause nobody else will do 

This is all I want out of life 
Please know your love I will not deny 
I'm gonna stay 
I'm gonna stay true to you 
I think I'll stay true I'm gonna see it through I'm gonna stay true 
'Cause nobody else will do 
Ya want to know what I believe that your love is real 
You won't ever leave that they'll never steal 
I'm gonna stay true and that's my attitude 
I'm gonna stay true 'cause nobody else will do
