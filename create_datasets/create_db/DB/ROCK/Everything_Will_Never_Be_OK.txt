Everything in your life is explained away
As part of a process that holds you back
A walk along an avenue of trees is just what you need
But the memory of divorce lingers on

Everything will never be okay
There'll always be some part of you in pain
Everything will never be okay

There's a lack of oxygen inside this town
It stops my brain from getting me high
Every time I wake up it's a brand new day
And I realize my body's designed to die

You can take an hour or two out of every day
Living in a world of lies you feel no pain
Cause I'm waiting for the day when I don't have to work
And love will satisfy my impatience
You know how much my dear that I would love to talk
But I'm far too busy on this occasion

You can take an hour or two out of every day
Living in a world of music you feel no pain

It's just as real to escape as to suffer
