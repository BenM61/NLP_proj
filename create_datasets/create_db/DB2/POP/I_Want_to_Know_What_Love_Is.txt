I gotta take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older

In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me

I'm gonna take a little time
A little time to look around me
I've got nowhere left to hide
It looks like love has finally found me

In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
I can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me, show me

(I wanna know what) I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me (and I feeling so much love)
AI want to feel what love is 
I know you can show me

I wanna know what love is
Let's talk about love
I want you to show me
