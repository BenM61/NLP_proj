When they met, the way they smiled, I saw that I was through
Oh, you crazy moon, what did you do?
And when they kissed, 
They tried to say that it was just in fun
Oh, you crazy moon, look what you've done

Once you promised me, you know, that it would never end
You should be ashamed to show your funny face, my friend

There they are, they fell in love, 
I guess you think that you're smart
Oh, you crazy moon, you broke my heart

Once you promised me, you know, that it would never end
You should be ashamed to show your funny face, my friend

And there they are, they fell in love, 
I guess you think that you're smart
Oh, you crazy moon, you broke my heart
