Drifting further out to sea,
The strength will soon be leaving me.
Our ships have sunk or run aground,
And only sharks now swim around.
Smashed and battered by the waves,
Support their hope of being saved.
And every passing ship to chance,
Salvation in a passing glance.

I may need dreams from time to time,
But dreams aren't keeping me alive.
My dreams have torn my life in two--
Now I just need a rock to cling to.

I'm often closer than I think,
Yet my grip is far too weak.
I grab a box and swim away,
Time and time and time again.
But not for me this time I guess
And then the next and then the next.
Is my fear of crashing waves
Greater than my fear of being saved?

I may need dreams from time to time,
But dreams aren't keeping me alive.
My dreams have torn my life in two
Now I just need a rock to cling to.
