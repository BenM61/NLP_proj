Yo, I'm quite single, and occassionally I mingle
But aside from all the rest, she sparks my interest
No, ma'am, I don't know you
Just offering the common respect I feel I owe you
Also, some conversation, companionship, common-ground and common-sense
There's no such thing as coincidence in, me finding you here
And I really hate screaming in your ear, so some other time, OK?
I waited a day hello?
This is Carlito from a couple of days ago, you sound tired
Forgive me if I've called you too late
But what better time to relate mind-state? Where could I begin?
Hasn't anyone ever told you you got beautiful skin?
You're more than welcome, what do you desire within?
I just, wanna be, there's no need to put titles on you and me
Those are limitations, living and learning are our only obligations
Equality, honesty, independence, intelligence, emotion and devotion
Humbly seeking to hear God when he's speaking
At one time, my mind, just, couldn't conceive
A woman had to dress a certain way to believe
But, in the same breath, a-llow me to say
That, if you believed young lady, you wouldn't dress that way
And I, was attracted to your class, I couldn't see all yo' ass
And, I was very content, and you deserved every complement
Now, remember our indifferences make us the same
You gotta have some game, or
You ain't even gonna be able to take care of yourself, uh
And Love, when I look at you, I see my reflection
So I offer my love, affection and protection
Shawty, you dead fine, but the bottom-line is
You're still my sister

Well, I say you're my, beginnin my end
You're my sista lover and friend
God is, your light from within
It shines through your beautiful skin
What they, say bout you ain't true
There's no me if there is no you
I hope, that you understand
You got to respect yourself before I can

Yeah, I met you and y'all knew, saw you again on Marietta
Downtown Atlanta, checkin your long legs, got me smirkin
Fixed me dinner one night, candles lit
Kinda ahought you was slick in the beginnin
But it teurned out you wouldn't lie
Looked me in my eye, I listened
Sucked it up, pushed on, we made amends, both sides clicked
True friends, since then, years done gon by
Brought a baby girl into this world, made our parents grandfolks
Household with no hope, took care of ye, you me
When shit got put out on the curb
Closer than the skin on the back of my hand
Through the thick and thin, we can win
Beautiful black skin

Well, I say you're my, beginnin my end
You're my sista lover and friend
God is, your light from within
It shines through your beautiful skin
What they, say bout you ain't true
There's no me if there is no you
I hope, that you understand
You got to respect yourself before I can

No need to compete, with the music loud
Or stairs cold, put on a scale, of one to ten, you a twelve
I chose, her over jail and hell
Originally from ATL

Compatible souls come together, under bad weather
To discuss distrust amongst the so-called
Good in every wo-man, how I wish this was true
I deal with facts only, already done cloned me
Why I sang the blues, when there's only one God
That watches over our every step, I need his help
When I'm walkin, lookin for the right female
I can't tell sometimes
They tell me the devil's comin humble in his approach
Spontaneous with the game
He caught the naive of a girl fallin for the OK
Let the pistol smoke the one you live by
Die by, examples of how relationships can be

I rolls the dice, takin a chance at crappin out
Like today boy, I lost one of my best hips
Natural thick lips, no animal fat implants
Wide load, just started workin at the airport
19 years old, worth more than her weight in gold
But it was all my fault, so don't cry, understand
If down the line I want you back and the feelin ain't mutual
Just promise me you'll find a new man that's bout some business
Hope she find what her was lookin for, like a dreamto my end
I wanted to be more than friends
Beautiful black skin (black skin)

Well, I say you're my, beginnin my end
You're my sista lover and friend
God is, your light from within
It shines through your beautiful skin
What they, say bout you ain't true
There's no me if there is no you
I hope, that you understand
You got to respect yourself before I can

Well, I say you're my, beginnin my end
You're my sista lover and friend
God is, your light from within
It shines through your beautiful skin
What they, say bout you ain't true
There's no me if there is no you
I hope, that you understand
You got to respect yourself before I can
