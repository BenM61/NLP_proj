When I first saw you I knew nothing's like it used to be
Boy, you have got to be the finest thing in history
The way I feel inside is just so hard to understand
You feed my appetite in ways I can't explain

I'll eat you up, your love, your love
I'll eat you up, your love, your love
Woah, I'll eat you up,
Woah, so yum yum
Woah, can't get enough,
Woah, oh oh, I think I'm in love

If you move any closer, boy, there is no guarantee
What I will do to you I fear it and it's scaring me
Like I've become some kind of demon in the night
You look so tasty, I could eat you up alive

I'll eat you up, your love, your love
I'll eat you up, your love, your love
Woah, I'll eat you up,
Woah, so yum yum
Woah, can't get enough,
Woah, oh oh, I think I'm in love

I'll eat you up, your love, your love
I'll eat you up, your love, your love
Woah, I'll eat you up,
Woah, so yum yum
Woah, can't get enough,
Woah, oh oh, I think I'm in love

Can't stop thinking 'bout the things I wanna do to you
If you move any closer you'd be asking for it too
I want your love, I need your touch
So much I think I'm in love

I'll eat you up, your love, your love
Woah, I'll eat you up,
Woah, so yum yum
Woah, can't get enough,
Woah, oh oh, I think I'm in love

I wanna take you to my room
I'll eat you up
I wanna take you to my room
Woah I'll eat you up,
Woah, so yum yum
Woah, can't get enough,
Woah, oh oh, I think I'm in love

I'll eat you up
I'll eat you up
I'll eat you up
I'll eat you up

I'll eat you up
I'll eat you up
I'll eat you up
