Coffee,tea or me baby, touche ole
My opening line might be a bit passe
But don't think that I don't know what I'm feeling for you
'Cause I got a vibe on you 
The first time that I saw you, saw you
 
I need your love, and I won't bring no pain
A little birdie told me that you feel the same game
I'm for the real, and for you I'm true blue
Let's make a deal, sugar
All I want to do is be your one and only lover
 
I just want to be your lovergirl
I just want to rock your world
Oh, yea
 
Hook line and sinker baby, that's how you caught me
My second verse might be a bit old hat
But don't think that I don't know what it's doing to me
'Cause I got a vibe on you 
The first time you saw through me, through me
 
I need your love, and I won't bring no pain
A little birdie told me that you feel the same game
I'm for the real, and for you I'm true blue
Let's make a deal, sugar
All I want to do is be your one and only lover
 
I just want to be your lovergirl
I just want to rock your world
Oh, yea
 
I just want to be your lovergirl
I just want to rock your world
Oh, yea
 
I just want to be your lovergirl
I just want to rock your world
Oh, yea
 
I just want to be your lovergirl
I just want to rock your world
Oh, yea
