It was written in the stars 
That our love would be born 
It was written in the stars 
We'd meet early one morn? 

So when first I saw you appear 
As the night left the sea 
This was no coincidence, dear, 
It was fated to be... 

In the heavens high above 
Where dreams flourish and flower 
It was written that our love 
Would grow stronger each hour 

So remember when at last you are mine 
And Venus is mated to Mars 
It was written, 
Always written 
In the stars!
