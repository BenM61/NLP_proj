Teenage rebels rule okay 
I'll be damned if I work all day 
I think that you look okay 
I won't even look your way

Teenage rebels out all night 
Teenage rebels drink and fight 
Rockabilly rebel don't go to school 
Teenage rebel rule rule rule

Teenage rebels out all night 
Teenage rebels drink and fight 
Rockabilly rebel don't go to school

Hey hey hey hey 
You look like something that the cat dragged in 
Yeah well you look something of an assembly line 

I think it's high time you pay some rent 
I'd rather leave home and live in a tent 
The principal say you've been cuttin' class 
Well you can take that school and shove it up your ass 

That music you're playing is way too loud 
Ooh Rock and Roll is never too loud
Teenage rebels rule okay 
I'll be damned if I work all day 

I think that you look okay 
I won't even look your way
Teenage rebels out all night 
Teenage rebels drink and fight 

Rockabilly rebel don't go to school 
Ooh teenage rebel rule rule rule 
Hey hey hey hey
