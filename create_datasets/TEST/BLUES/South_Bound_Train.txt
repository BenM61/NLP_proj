I wonder why that south-bound train don't run
I wonder why that south-bound train don't run
Now you don't need no tellin', little girl, you know what you done

You made me love you, now your man done come
You made me love you, now your man done come
Now you leave me here worryin' baby, and I'm just the lonely one

Standin' at a station, now, waitin' for a train
Standin' at a station, I'm waitin' on a train
Now, deep down in my poor heart, baby, that a lot, an achin' pain

Mr. conductor man, please let me ride your train
Mr. conductor man, please let me ride your train
Now if I make it to that lowland, man, I'll be a happy man

Standin' at a station, tears was in my eye
Standin' at a station, tears was in my eye
Now that I've lost my best friend, how can I be satisfied?

I hear a whistle, wonderin' where is that train
I hear a whistle, wonderin' where is that train
Now that I've lost my baby, I've got all red brain
