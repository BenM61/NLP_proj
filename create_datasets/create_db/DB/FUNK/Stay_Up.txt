Let me start with a soft caress 
Wanna show you I'm not like the rest 
So put me to the test 
Anything that you feel let it go 
Wanna take things nice and slow 
So baby lose control 
I want this, want that 
I want anything, anything 

So let's stay up tonight 
Girl that's all 
Let me sing you a song 
So let's stay up tonight 
Girl that's all 
Let me sing you this song 
'cause it's all about love tonight 
It's all you see 
So stay up with me tonight 

So come make it right next to me 
Let me show you what love can be 
I'll kiss the lips softly 
I'm lookin' you right in the eyes 
Girl I slowly go deep inside 
Your heart is what I mean 
'Cause I want this, want that 
I want anything, anything 

So let's stay up tonight 
Girl that's all
