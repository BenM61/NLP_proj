And then it was over and we took our applause
We passed the peace pipe and thought no more
About the scenes that were missing, about the lines we had crossed
And we smiled at each other and we knew that the moment was lost

I let you snuff out the candles, I let you blow out the flame
And I knew that this time it would never be the same
The smile you had wavered, tears welled in your eyes
And I looked and I knew that this magic, it was only a sign

For sunsets on Empire, it was only a dream
I knew that it was broken when I heard you scream
I know you can't believe it that it meant nothing at all
And we looked at each other and we smiled and the moment was gone

The sunsets on Empire, is this really the end?
Sunsets on Empire left with a friend
Could have been a lover, could have been a wife
But when it comes right down to it all I want is a life
Just a life

You said it never mattered, you said it's just a thrill
You couldn't beat it, another bitter pill
It never was a habit, a one off just for sure
You never really thought it out but I hoped that one time
That you'd come back for more

The sunsets on Empire, that's where I am
Sunsets on Empire, that's all we have
So face a new beginning when you're so close to the end
And you looked at me gently and smiled, could you still be my friend?

You started to smile
Is this really the end?
Is this really the end?

Sunsets on Empire
The sunsets on Empire
