Everybody at your party 
They don't look depressed
Everybody dressin' funny 
Color me impressed

Stayin' out late tonight
Won't be gettin' any sleep
Givin' out their word
Cause that's all that they won't keep

Put the party on the mirror
Oh shit, pass the bill to Chris
Intoxicated lover ending our french kiss

Can you stand me on my feet? (2x)

(Everybody) (many x)

Everybody at your party 
They don't look depressed
And everybody's dressin' funny 
Color me impressed

Color me impressed (4x)
I call it out (?)
