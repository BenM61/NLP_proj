You love sun in the distance
Trying to be a pretty golden brown.
Smoke and rum is my mission
Happiness is all I need right now.

Gonna come a time
There's gonna come a time when
I can go to Mexico

I believe in the here and now
I believe in the here and now tomorrow's pain will melt away.

Get your hands on the trigger
I saw the latest story on TV
A blue bag flowed past my window
This helicopter's too damn close to me.

And there's 
There's gonna come a time
There will come a time, we'll be just like Mexico

When I go there
When I go there, I'll be wearing purple ribbons when I go there
When I go there, I'll be dancing in the street when I go there
When I go there...

We can go to Mexico
