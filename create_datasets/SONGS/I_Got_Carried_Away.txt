Hey girl, now I know
You've been waiting for me much too long
But I got caught up in traffic
One turn I made was wrong

You see the DJ on the radio
Was playing our song
And I was reminiscing of the day
That passed and gone

Oh, I just, baby, I got carried away
Carried away, carried away

And before I knew it
I was ten miles out of the way
My mind was filled with thoughts
Sweet thoughts of yesterday

Of a time when you took my hand
And made me feel just like a man
Of a time when you took a hold
And thrilled my very soul

Oh, I just, baby, I got carried away
Carried away, carried away

294 said the highway sign
I should be home by now, home just in time
To lay her down to sleep
And pray the Lord her soul to keep
'Cause I love her, lover her, love her

By the time I got started
In the right direction
The DJ on the radio
Was playing another selection

But our song
Was still on my mind
Memories lingered on
Of how you have been so kind

Oh, I just, baby, I, I got carried away
Carried away, carried away

Thinking about the times
When you were so good to me

Oh, I just, baby, I got carried away
Carried away, carried away
Carried away, carried away

And before I knew it
I was ten miles out of the way
And I was wondering
Would you believe me when I say

Oh, I just, baby, I got carried away
Carried away, carried away
Carried away, carried away
Carried away, carried away
Carried away, carried away
