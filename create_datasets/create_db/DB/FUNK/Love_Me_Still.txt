Here is my hand for you to hold 
Here's the part of me they have not sold 
I've wandered far, I've had my fill 
I need you now, do you love me still 

Only you have seen the hidden part of me 
Call me foolhardy if you will 
But I loved you when, do you love me still 

So many smiles and lies surround me 
Empty expectations, faceless fears 
Sometimes this life is a bitter pill 
I love you now, do you love me still 

You have been mine since time untold 
Our love is immortal, don't you know 
Others will come, and they will go 
But I loved you young, I love you old 

Only you have seen, the other side of me 
Call me naive, I think you will 
But I loved you then, do you love me still 

Here are the eyes that only see you 
Here is the mouth that only calls your name 
Here is the soul that can not kill 
I love you now, do you love me still
