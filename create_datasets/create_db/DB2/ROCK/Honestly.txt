Please don't mind what I'm trying to say 'cause I'm, I'm being honest
When I tell you that you
You, You're part of the reason I'm so set on the rest of my life
Being a part of you
You tell me what you think about being open,
About being honest with yourself

Cause things will never be the same.

So I guess I'll see you, I'll see you around
I'm spinning, while I'm falling down
Now you know why I'm begging you to stay

Don't waste time getting to the point, 'cause I'm, I'm patiently waiting
For your next phone call, your next excuse for losing sleep again
Tell me what you think about being open,
About being honest with yourself

Cause things will never be the same.

So I guess I'll see you, I'll see you around
I'm spinning, while I'm falling down
Now you know why I'm begging you to stay

Cause I can't stop it now
It's so amazing how
I know I can't, I could never walk away

How can we resolve this now?
We let it go, and wonder how
This can ever be the same
(Can never be the)
Can ever be the same

So I guess I'll see you, I'll see you around
I'm spinning, I'm while falling down
Now you know why I'm begging you, I'm begging!

Cause I can't stop it now,
It's so amazing how,
I know I can't, I could never walk away!

Please don't mind what I'm trying to say 'cause I'm, I'm being honest.
