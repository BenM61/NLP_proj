The times you spent there
I thought you weren't coming back
They moved those stones
I don't know how
I saw what Ezekiel saw
They said "are you?"
I said 'I might'
We know it's wrong but
But hell it's right

I told you so I think you knew
Just what it is we're coming to
I told you so believe me now
You cannot see what I can see
I let you down but you're
Getting me higher and higher
It's hard to take but you're
Three hundred years old today
By the time you've traced me

I'll be miles away
I think you know why
I'm not staying here
I told you so

In the green light of your schemes
Something sends me to sleep
I don't know what it is
I don't know what it is

You should be watching me
I've been asleep for years
It's just that we preserve
It's no big deal you know
I couldn't help realizing
That the French are rising
There'll be an uprising
On the skies' horizon
