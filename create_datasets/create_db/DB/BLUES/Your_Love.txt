It's not the flowers, wrapped in fancy paper
It's not the ring, I wear around my finger
There's nothing in all the world I need
When I have you here beside me, 
Here beside me

So you could give me wings to fly 
And catch me if I fall
Or pull the stars down from the sky
So I could wish on them all
But I couldnt as for more
'cause your love is the greatest gift of all

In your arms, I found a strength inside me 
And in your eyes there's a light to guide me
I would be lost with out you
And all that my heart could ever want
Has come true

So you could give me wings to fly 
And catch me if I fall
Or pull the stars down from the sky
So I could wish on them all
But I couldnt as for more
'Cause your love is the greatest gift of all

You could offer me the sun, the moon
And I would still believe
You gave me everything 
When you gave your heart to me

So you could give me wings to fly 
And catch me if I fall
Or pull the stars down from the sky
So I could wish on them all
But I couldnt as for more
'Cause your love is the greatest gift of all
