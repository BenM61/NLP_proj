When I'm lying on the floor, starring at the door
And tears are falling down

Don't think I can't make it alone.

Been lying here for days,
Soaking up the pain
My tears are slowly drowned

Don't think I can't make it alone.

So I move my feet up off the ground,
Get myself in the shower,
Wash you off.
I'm too strong to fail, stronger now
Don't get twisted, not missing you,
Take a look

This is me,
And I will not be invisible
You can't keep me in control,
Tonight I'm startin' again.

Don't think I can make it alone.

No I will not be invisible,
Shining bright like a star, I'm in control
No you won't hurt me again,
You won't hurt me again

When I'm reaching out for life,
And die a thousand times
Too weak to carry on

Don' think I can't make it alone!

When the silence is the sound,
And hope is fading out
And all the love is gone

Don't think I can't make it alone!

For a while the ground was gone,
Don't worry I weren't there for long
I'm stronger now, too strong to fall
Don't get twisted. 'Not missing you. Take a look.

This is me,
And I will not be invisible
You can't keep me in control, tonight I'm startin' again.

Don't think I can't make it alone.

No I will not be invisible,
Shining bright like a star, I'm in control
No you won't hurt me again,
You won't hurt me again...

Take a look (I won't hurt) 
Take a look (I won't hurt) 
Take a look (I won't hurt) 
Take a look (I won't hurt) 
Take a look (I won't hurt) 
Take a look (I won't hurt) 
Take a look (I won't hurt) 

This is me!

And I will not be invisible
You can't keep me in control,
Tonight I'm startin' again.

Don't think I can't make it alone

No I will not be invisible,
Shining bright like a star, I'm in control
No you won't hurt me again,
You won't hurt me again...
(again, again, again, again)
