It's been a long cold winter without you
I've been crying on the inside over you
You just slipped through my fingers as life turned away
It's been a long cold winter since that day
It's hard to find, hard to find
Hard to find the strength now but I try
And I don't want to, I don't want to
I don't want to to speak now of what's gone by
'cause no matter what I say no matter what I do
I can't change what happened
No matter what I say, no matter what I do
I can't change what happened
You just slipped through my fingers
And I feel so ashamed
You just slipped through my fingers
And I've paid
