You know how we've grown
And how they catch our every turn

Everyone's arrived here
I see the pictures of everyone
And they truly got it

But it's your image burned into my mind
And again I find
That it's worth the climb
And I love
That it's right on time

Our love comes back in the middle of the night
Our love comes back in the middle of the night
Our love comes back in the middle of the night
