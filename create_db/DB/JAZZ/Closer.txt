Now I'm thinking maybe, I was stoned
I felt my feet lifted off the ground
And my heart was screaming
And my bones
I need you closer

As in the middle of the street
Then I pretend he is mine to keep
Cars are running fast on both sides
Of his head, his eyes say
Closer closer closer

I met him when the sun was down
The bar was closed
We both have had no sleep
My face beneath the street lamp
It reveals what it is lonely people seek
Closer closer closer

And I am close enough to lose
Close to the point, where you know that your mind, it can not choose
Close enough to lose
Close enough
To lose your heart
