Oh the feelings never went away
Like she did
Now she haunts all my dreams

Oh love's traces left in memories
I was once alone
Now she haunts all my dreams

Now she haunts all of my dreams
Now she haunts them all

Oh I thought I saw her yesterday
Thought our eyes met
Now she haunts all my dreams

Oh I tried so hard not to believe
I held her
Now she haunts all my dreams

Now she haunts all of my dreams
Now she haunts them all
Now she haunts all of my dreams
Now she haunts them all

Now she haunts all of my dreams
Now she haunts them all
Now she haunts all of my dreams
Now she haunts them all
