We have been risen from out of the grave
For something's disturbed our sleep
Nuclear waste has awakened us all
Bringing pain to those Deceased
We don't know why We are alive
Our bodily functions are dead
Inflicted mutants rising from death
And back to a life We once led.....
We beg for peace, Dead and free, from the world
A nuclear leak has reversed the procedure
Of death the eternal sleep
Why are We here back on this earth?
To march and to stalk and creep?
We are the Dead and We want our peace
So put us back in the grave
Letting us rest in afterlife's hands
An intense mysterious place.....
We beg for peace, Dead and free, from the world
Birth by Radiation!!
