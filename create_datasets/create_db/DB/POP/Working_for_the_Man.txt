Hey now you better listen to me everyone of you
We got a lotta, lotta, lotta, lotta work to do
Forget about your woman and that water can
Today were working for the man

Well pick up your feet
We've got a deadline to meet
I'm gonna see you make it on time
Don't relax
I want elbows and backs
I want to see everybody from behind

'Cause your working for the man working for the man
You gotta make him a hand when you're working for the man

So I'm pickin' 'em up and I'm laying 'em down
I believe he's gonna work me into the ground
I pull to the left, I heave to the right
I want to kill him but it wouldn't be right

'Cause I'm working for the man, working for the man
I gotta make him a hand when you're working for the man

Well the boss man's daughter sneaks me water
Every time her daddy's down the line
She says meet me tonight love a me right
And everything is gonna be fine
So I slave all day without much pay
And I'm just biding my time
'Cause the company and the daughter, you see
They're both gonna be all mine

Yah I'm gonna be the man, I'm gonna be the man
Gotta make him a hand if I'm gonna be the man

Working for the man, working for the man
I gotta make him a hand
Working for the man
