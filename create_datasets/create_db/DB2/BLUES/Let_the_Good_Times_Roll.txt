Hey, everybody, let's have some fun
You only live but once
And when you're dead you're done

So let the good times roll
Let the good times roll
I don't care if you're young or old
Get together, let the good times roll

Don't sit there mumblin', talkin' trash
If you wanna have some fun
You gotta spend some cash

So let the good times roll
Let the good times roll
I don't care if you're young or old
Go out and get together, let the good times roll

Don't sit there mumblin', talkin' trash
If you wanna have a ball
You better spend some cash

So let the good times roll
Let the good times roll
Yeah, I don't care if you're young or old
Go out and get together, let the good times roll

Hey Mister Landlord, lock up all the doors
When the police comes around
Just tell them that the joint is closed

And let the good times roll
Let the good times roll
I don't care if you're young or old
Get up and get together and let the good times roll

Hey everybody, tell everybody
That B.B. and Bob is in town
I got a dollar and a quarter
And I'm just rarin' theclown
But don't let nobody play me cheap
I got fifty cents more that I'm gonna keep

I don't care if you're young or old
Let's get together and let the good times roll

Let them roll, let them roll
Let them roll, let them roll, let them roll, baby
Let them roll all night long, let them roll all night long, let them roll all night long
Let them roll all night long
Let them roll, let them roll
Let them roll, let them roll all night long
Let them, can I hear it one more time, everybody
Let them roll, let them roll all night long
Let them roll all night long, let them roll all night long
Oh shit
Oh shit
