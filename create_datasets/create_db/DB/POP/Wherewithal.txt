I wish I had the wherewithal
To attract your attention.
Wish I had the wherewithal
To attract your attention.

You are so nonpareil
You introduce a new elation in my life
But you are so nonchalant
I don't suppose this new sensation will materialise.

I wish I had the wherewithal
To attract your attention.
Wish I had the wherewithal
To attract your attention.

If I hadn't inhibitions enough to cope with
Now you come along beautiful and leave me hoping
If it wasn't complicated enough to start with
Now you're making this feeling so hard to part with.

INSTRUMENTAL

You are so nonpareil
You introduce a new elation in my life
But you are so nonchalant
I don't suppose this new sensation will materialise.

I wish I had the wherewithal
To attract your attention.
Wish I had the wherewithal
To attract your attention.
I wish I had the wherewithal
To attract your attention.
