Lady love, go back to sleep,
Dry the tears from your eyes,
But I cannot stay with thee,
Until the morning,
For the dawn is breaking,
And my ship is waiting for me,
And I must go,
But I'll be back, yes,
Before this year is over;

And we sailed across the sea,
'Til we found America,
'Round the Cape of Storms,
We set our sails for home,
And when the sea was roaring,
And the Lord I called,
To help my drowning men,
I saw the light, yes, the candle in your window

And I have brought you silver,
And I have brought you gold,
And spices from the Indies in the hold;
I've seen ships on the horizon,
That I'd swear were going down,
And now I know for certain,
The world is round,
I have seen, my eyes have seen.

Oh, one day says Galileo,
A man will reach the sky,
And see the world completely,
From outside,
And gazing down from yonder,
On a world of blue and green,
He'll say with eyes of wonder,
I have seen, I have seen,
My eyes have seen.
