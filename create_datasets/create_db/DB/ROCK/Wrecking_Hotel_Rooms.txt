I wrecked your hotel room
I crashed up the car
Slept in the gutter
I'm outside your door

Saw you through the key hole
Down on your knees
There's really no reason to call the police

Do you hold the phone when you're alone
Imagine that it rings then hold it to your ear
And wish that I was there to sing you off to sleep
Be with you in your dreams for the days I will be gone
I'll be there in your dreams and in this song

I know you don't know me
'Cause we've never met
I'm not really crazy
So don't get upset

I've got all these problems
None with solutions
Been in and out of some nice institutions

Do you hold the phone when you're alone
Imagine that it rings then hold it to your ear
And wish that I was there to sing you off to sleep
Be with you in your dreams for the days I will be gone
I'll be there in your dreams and in this song
I'll be there in your dreams and in this song

Do you hold the phone when you're alone
Imagine that it rings then hold it to your ear
And wish that I was there to sing you off to sleep
Be with you in your dreams for the days I will be gone
I'll be there in your dreams and in this song
I'll be there in your dreams and in this song
I'll be there in your dreams and in this song
I'll be there in your dreams and in this song
I'll be there in your dreams and in this song
