At eight a.m. the alarm bell rings
And I shake myself awake
Halfway through the kitchen when I ask myself
Can there be some kinda mistake
'Cause I'm working on somebody else's time
And I'm working for somebody else's dime

I used to have it all but I lost it in the fall
Now I'm working for somebody else
And the hours are lousy, the boss is a creep
But the paycheck sure does help
And at five o'clock I'm out like a shot
I don't take my workload home

Working for somebody else
Working for somebody else
Working for somebody else
There's no reason to be working for somebody else

Now, listen
I had a girl and a car and a house with a yard
Now that's all gone with the wind
'Cause here it's nine a.m. and I'm standing in line
Just waiting to punch myself in
Someday at ten if I haven't come in
If they want to find me I'll be

Working for somebody else
Working for somebody else
Working for somebody else
There's no reason to be working for somebody else

Working for somebody else is fine
If you need the money and you're so inclined to be
Working for somebody else
Working for somebody else
Working for somebody else
There's no reason to be working for somebody else
There's no reason to be working for somebody else
There's no reason to be working for somebody else

Mmm, mmm, mmm
How long must this go on?
I been working too hard and too long for too little
Seem like every day is just about the same
And it don't get any better
Lord, Mr. Ford, can I please please please have a day off?
