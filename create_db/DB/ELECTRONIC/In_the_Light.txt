You know, and you see
That you got to be you
No other way will do, and you gonna be free
If you are, let yourself be

Sometimes the pain is hard to bear in life,
I understand this to be true
'Cause I'm another human being
In those times when you feel like nobody understands you
I'll leave the light on for you
I'll leave the light on for you

In the light, In the light, In the light
It's on and you cant deny, you cant, no
You can't deny
When it's right there in your face what can you do but
Except whats there for you

I'll leave the light on for you
I'll leave the light on for you
I'll leave the light on for you
The light on

Sometimes it's on, oh, oh
Its time to see what we've been given and move on
Oh, Its time to see what we've been given and move on
Oh woah, you know what I see
Its only that we are
In this time amazing
And the music is strong and I can feel it in my soul
Inside (x15)
Inside your soul

I'll leave the light on for you
I'll leave the light on for you
I'll leave the light on for you
I'll leave the light on for you
The light on
