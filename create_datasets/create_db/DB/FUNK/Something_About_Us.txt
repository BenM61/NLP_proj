I bet you think we don't know how to be a part of this game 
We don't want to talk about the reason but it's true 
We are not the same 
I bet you think what we had is like a picture with no frame 
Baby don't worry and remember the right people know our name 

You try to figure out is it real is it show 
I don't want to hear this nasty stuff 
'Cause you don't know the things I know 
Don't ask me what it's all about 
You've gotta understand 
We're doing things we want to do, we're chosen to 
We're trying to be as real as we can 
Here's something about us straight from the heart 
We belong together right from the start 
Destiny told us there is no doubt 
Respect is what it's all about 

I bet you think we don't know what we have got to do 
'Cause every time you come around you act like we don't have a clue 
And I bet you think we still care if you will like us too 
But we are through, yeah 

You try to figure out is it real is it show 
I don't want to hear this nasty stuff

We try to be as real as we can 

There's something about us straight from the heart 
We belong together right from the start 
Destiny told us there is no doubt 
Respect is what it's all about 

There's something about us you can't explain 
The only thing we're here for is to entertain 
Destiny told us not to run away 
We will make it anyway 

God please save us we are just five angels 
We are puppets on a string 
God please help us we don't earn any money 

Something about us 
This is coming from our heart 
We belong together right from the start
Destiny told us there should be no doubt 

Something about us 
It's something that you can't explain 
All we want to do is to entertain 
Respect is what it's all about 

It's something about us straight from the heart 
We belong together right from the start
