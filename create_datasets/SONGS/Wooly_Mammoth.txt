In the summer, vicious summer
This is nothing 
Like I thought it would look

You say, "Who am I to blame?"
"Who am I to blame?"
Spill yourself at her feet
Stamp me out flickering

You remind me 
Which are the ones that sting
They all look the same to me,
Look the same to me

Spill yourself at her feet
Stamp me out flickering
There's a sun rising
Steady now
Comfort me

Big Sur swallowed, swallowed me alive
You say, "Who am I to blame?"
"Who am I to blame?"

Spill yourself at her feet
Stamp me out flickering
There's a sun rising
Steady now
Comfort me
