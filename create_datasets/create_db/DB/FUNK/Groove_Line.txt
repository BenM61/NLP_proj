Pack your grip, takin' you on a trip
Ain't no seats, all we got's dancin' feet

Leave you worries behind
'Cause rain, shine, won't mind
We're ridin' on the groove line tonight

Get this train, know you'll be glad you came
Hit the track, party hard there and back

Leave you worries behind
'Cause rain, shine, don't mind
We're ridin' on the groove line tonight

Uh uh uh 
Uh uh uh 

Check out, the wheels are turnin', you know we won't stop
We got this boiler burnin', we're keepin' it hot

So grab your friends, get the train comin' through
Climb on board where you leave's up to you

Leave you worries behind
'Cause rain, shine, don't mind
We're ridin' on the groove line tonight
