I sit back and I close my eyes  
Lookin' back at all the lows and all the highs
Through the black and white and in between 
All the miles I've walked the wars I've fought and all I've seen

It all seems like yesterday like a bird, time just flies
No sooner than you said hello its time, its time, its time to say goodbye

Consumed by worry, stress and fear, never learning to live
Weighed down by wondering why we're here
Collected memories, all that's in the end 
I guess a sense of peace wasn't meant for some, my friend

It all seems like yesterday
Like a bird, time just flies
No sooner than you said hello
Its time, its time, its time to say goodbye

Goodbye goodbye goodbye
