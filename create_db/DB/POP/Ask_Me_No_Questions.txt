If I told you I don't mind
Would you believe me?
When I say to you, you're not my kind
Do I deceive you with this fragile disguise?
Ask me no questions
And I will tell you no lies
If you could read my heart I would not deny
But I pretend

All these tears on my face don't imply
That I'm not happy just to see you with her
One small voice that will never be heard
I'm in love with you
Oh, I'm in love with you
But I turn away when you look in my eyes
Ask me no questions I'll tell you no lies
I'm in love with you

I'm in love with you
Oh, I'm in love with you
Trying to smile with a hole in my heart
No one knows I'm falling apart
I'm in love with you
Oh, I'm in love with you
But I turn away when you look in my eyes
Ask me no questions I'll tell you no lies
I'm in love with you
