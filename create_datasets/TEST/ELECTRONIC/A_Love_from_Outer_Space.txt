She loves me she loves me she loves me
A love from outer space

it's true

I know where she's coming from
Space is where we both belong
Got to tell her in this song
This time, love, we can't go wrong

she comes arriving via space express
Meet the girl who (?)
(?) guest
Just can't wait for her caress
She comes from milky way
She's come to earth on my birthday
(?)
(?)

shalalalalalala hey

she loves me she loves me she loves me
A love from outer space
