Loyalty rests in the heart of a dog
Don't set all your eggs on the back of a frog
You can lick it twice but it won't lick you
And salvating salvation gone so long so

Loyalty lives and we don't know why
And the paw is pressed against the nerve of the sky
You can leave him behind but he won't leave you
And the road to Heaven is true - true blue

Loyalty lives and we don't know why
And his paws are pressed to the spine of the sky
You can leave him twice, but he won't leave you
And the way to Heaven is true - true blue

Say - Banga
