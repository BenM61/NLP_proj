Sometimes I hate myself for loving you
And my dreams are just dramatic versions of
My real life.
And life is short, but so am I.
What does it matter anyway?
Just a small price that I pay to feel the same way every single day
Every single day

I want to be somebody else.
Sick of myself and how I feel.
Don't recognize who I see in the morning.
Used to be so clear.
And now I'm waking up to strangers with their shadows on my face.
So quickly I remember what it felt like to be in this place
To be in this place...

The day is done and he has won
again I'm running from the one
I love, but I don't know
if its true.
Do I love you?

The day is done and he has won
again I'm running from the one
I love, but I don't know
if its true.
Who have I become?
Who have I become?
Who have I become?

And now I'm tired
Oh so tired of this story being told.
When did I wake up and
Suddenly my soul has grown so old?

You're never wrong.
You're never right.
It's never told in black and white.

To my surprise
I realize
That I am always on the run
Always on the run

The day is done and he has won
again I'm running from the one
I love, but I don't know
if its true.
Do I love you?

The day is done and he has won
again I'm running from the one
I love, but I don't know
if its true.
Who have I become?
Who have I become?
Who have I become?

It's always coming up so wrong.
And I am always on the run.
It's always coming up so wrong.
And I am always on the run

The day is done and he has won
again I'm running from the one
I love, but I don't know
if its true.
Do I love you?

The day is done and he has won
again I'm running from the one
I love, but I don't know
if its true.
Who have I become?
Who have I become?
Who have I become?
Who have I become?
Who have I become? (Who have I become?)
Who have I become? (Who have I become?)
