You've been acting awful tough lately
Smoking a lot of cigarettes lately
But inside, you're just a little baby
It's okay to say you've got a weak spot
You don't always have to be on top
Better to be hated 
Than loved loved loved for what your not 

You're vulnerable, you're vulnerable
You are not a robot
You're lovable, so lovable
But you're just troubled

Guess what I'm not a robot, a robot
Guess what I'm not a robot, a robot

You've been hanging with the unloved kids
Who you never really liked and you never trusted
But you are so magnetic, you pick up all the pins
Never committing to anything
You don't pick up the phone when it ring, ring, rings
Don't be so pathetic, just open up and sing

I'm vulnerable, I'm vulnerable
I am not a robot
You're lovable, so lovable
But you're just troubled

Guess what I'm not a robot, a robot
Guess what I'm not a robot, a robot

Can you teach me how to feel real
Can you turn my power on
Well, let the drum beat drop

Guess what I'm not a robot
Guess what I'm not a robot

Guess what I'm not a robot, a robot
Guess what I'm not a robot, a robot
Guess what I'm not a robot, a robot
Guess what I'm not a robot, a robot
