What will you do when there's so much to lose
But you won't pay the price to go on?
And where will you stand when there's no helping hand
Or no road to deter right from wrong
What good can it bring to ignore suffering
To shut out all the reason inside?
From life ordinary to the heights, they get scary
No reason it can't be denied

Oh brother, don't you know
The heart starts beating now?
Brother, can't you see?
There is no reason now

Walk between worlds, when you walk between worlds
When you walk between worlds, we will see
When you walk between worlds, when you walk between worlds
When you walk between worlds, you and me

So what will it bring when there's no offering
There's no music, no dreams, no way out?
No flag to unfold when you walk between worlds
No fear, no wisdom, no doubt
What good can it bring to ignore suffering
To shut out all the rage inside?
From life ordinary to the heights, the get scary
No reason it can't be denied

Oh brother, don't you know
The heart starts beating now?
Brother, can't you see?
There is no reason now
There is no reason now

Walk between worlds, when you walk between worlds
When you walk between worlds, you'll see
When you walk between worlds, when you walk between worlds
When you walk between worlds, you and me

Oh brother, don't you know
The heart starts beating now?
