My painted face is chipped and cratcked
My mind seems to fade too fast
Clutching straws, sinking slow
Nothing lasts, nothing lasts

A puppets motions controlled by a string
By a stranger I've never met
A nod of the head and a pull of a thread
I can't say no, can't say no

When a child throws down a toy
When I was new you wanted me
Now I'm old you no longer see me
When a child throws down a toy
Spite for girl, hate for boy
When a child throws out a toy

I'm all dressed up and no where to go
On a music box that never stop
I'll dance for if you want me to
Move in time, move in time

A wooden head and a broken heart
Used, abused and torn apart
I gave you my best and you gave me the rest
It's time to die, time to die
