I'm, going to ease, in on your beat
I'm going to shuffle when I move my feet
I'm gonna stuff your stuff with thang
Until I make your whole thang twang
I'm going to do things to your stuff (stuffs and things and things and stuff)

I got, my guitar, by my side
I got a band full of music, let's take a ride
I'll be flying somewhere in the stratosphere
But at the same time I'll be right here
Doing my utmost to your stuff (stuff and things and things and stuff things)

I'm going, to move in, on your groove
I'm gonna syncopate, good god!, I'm gonna be so cool
I'm gonna stuff your stuff with thangs
Until I make your whole thang twang
I'm gonna do things to your stuff (stuff and things and things and stuff)

I'm getting to your stuff when I get into my thing
I'm being in your stuff when I get into my thing
I'm gonna snuff your stuff when I get into my thing
I'm getting to your stuff when I get into my thing
