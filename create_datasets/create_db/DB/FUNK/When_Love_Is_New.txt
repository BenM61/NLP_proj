When love is new
Every day's a new sensation
When love is new
You thrill with infatuation

When love is born
(When it's born)
It's so warm, soft and tender
(So warm, soft)
Everybody's willing to surrender
When love is new
(When love is new, when it's new)

Don't let our love grow old
'Cause funny things happen
Then that love gets cold

So let's me and you make a pact
A promise to each other
For as long as we live
Long as we love, let's always

Always keep our love brand new
'Cause love is so wonderful
When love is new
(When love is new, when it's new)

I said when love is new
Every day's a new sensation
When love is new
You thrill with infatuation

When love is born
(When it's born)
It's so warm, soft and tender
(So warm, soft)
Everybody's willing to surrender

When love is new
(When love is new, when it's new)
When love is new, when love is new
(When love is new, when it's new)
It's so wonderful, marvelous, thrilling, serious

When love is new
(When love is new, when it's new)
When love is new
(When love is new, when it's new)

When love is new
(When love is new, when it's new)
Every day is a new sensation
When love is new
(When love is new, when it's new)

Warm, soft, tender
When love is new,
(When love is new, when it's new)
When love, when love is new
We want always to be together
