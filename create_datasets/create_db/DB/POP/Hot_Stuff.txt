Hot stuff, can't get enough 
Hot stuff, hot stuff, can't get enough 
The music is mighty, mighty fine 
Hot stuff, hot stuff can't get enough 
Hot stuff, can't get enough 
Hot stuff, can't get enough 
Hot stuff, can't get enough 

Music is mighty fine
Hot stuff

Hot stuff, I can't get enough
I can't get enough 
The music is what I want
My body always moving, ah, stick it
Hot stuff

Everyday I get another dose
I can't stand it when the music stops
Hot stuff

All the people in New York City
I know you're all going broke, but you're tough
Yeah, hot stuff, hot stuff 

To everybody in Jamaica
That's working in the sun
Your hot, your hot stuff
Shake it up, hot stuff

Hot stuff
Hot stuff
Hot stuff
