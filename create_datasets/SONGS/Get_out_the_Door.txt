Come on closer, won't you tell me what you got?
Wait a minute, girl, you're something that you're not
Big city's screaming, driving feathers to and fro
Brass in pocket, thought you hit it when you walked up to my door

I've been down this road so long
Been miles and miles of freaks before

Oh, get out the door, get out the door
Gonna kick you when I saw what you were packing
Gonna kick it out the door
Get out the door, get out the door
Gonna kick you when I saw what you were packing
Gonna kick it out the door

Like Transformers, girl, there's more than meets the eye
Another beer and then I might end up buyin'
The city screams - it's full of Angelos and Toms
Never underestimate the danger of Sunset Boulevard

I've been down this road so long
Been miles and miles of freaks before

Oh, get out the door, get out the door
Gonna kick you when I saw what you were packing
Gonna kick it out the door
Get out the door, get out the door
Gonna kick you when I saw what you were packing
Gonna kick it out the door

I've been down this road so long
Been miles and miles of freaks before

Oh, I've been down this road so long
Been miles and miles of freaks before
Think I'd stop and think I'm strong
But never could I've been so wrong, so wrong

Oh, get out the door, get out the door
Gonna kick you when I saw what you were packing
Gonna kick it out the door
Get out the door, get out the door
Gonna kick you when I saw what you were packing
Gonna kick it out the door
