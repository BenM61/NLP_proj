I am a liberace fan
A megastar in glam I am
I am what bobby is to pam
Khashoggi to iran I am

Looking in the mirror
The beauty that I see
It's hard to be this grand for free
Beg or steal or borrow
You'll never live to be
A charismatic star like me

God created man from dust
And man replied with sin and lust
God created man from dust
Eternal youth on solid ground
Beauty makes the world go round
Beauty makes the world go round
Amen

I am the pinnacle of man
A superselling brand I am
I am a record label scam
The biggest in japan I am

Entering the ballrooms
The clocks come to a still
The multimillionaires I thrill
Headline of the columns
My duellantes I kill
The pantheon obeys my will

Law of nature since big bang
Cry like young wurther sturm und drang
Law of nature since big bang
And louder than the wall of sound
Beauty makes the world go round
Beauty makes the world go round
Amen

I am a liberace fan
A megastar in glam I am
I am what bobby is to pam
Khashoggi to iran I am

You're so selfish
You son of a
Egomaniac
Egomaniac
Egomaniac

God created man from dust
And man replied with sin and lust
God created man from dust
Eternal youth on solid ground
Beauty makes the world go round
Beauty makes the world go round
Amen

I am a liberace fan
A megastar in glam I am
I am what bobby is to pam
Khashoggi to iran I am

I am the pinnacle of man
A superselling brand I am
I am a record label scam
The biggest in japan I am
It's real it's grand I am
