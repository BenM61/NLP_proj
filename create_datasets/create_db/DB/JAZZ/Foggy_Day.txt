I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low and had me down
I viewed the morning, with alarm
The British museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
Yes, for suddenly, I saw you there
And through the foggy London town
The sun was shining everywhere

How long, how long I wondered

But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town
The sun was shining everywhere
