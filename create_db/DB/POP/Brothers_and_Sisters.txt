I am my mama's son
You are your father's child
Sometimes we act as if we hate each other
A different faith, different state of mind
That don't mean we all can't be satisfied

We are all brothers and sisters
We are all brothers and sisters

Some are black and brown
Others white and light
That's all the difference I can remember

A different face, a different kind of smile
That's what we see
But this we must realize

We are all brothers and sisters
We are all brothers and sisters 

Earth is my mother, there is no other
So for you, so for all of I
Don't look me with a scorn
In time mankind was born
So for you, so for all of I
Love must live, hate must die
Don't draw no line, don't you be so blind

We are all brothers and sisters
We are all brothers and sisters 

I am no stranger in your town
Rasta seed is all around
So when you are looking at me
Don't think I am your enemy

I am my father's son
You are your mama's child
Sometimes we act as if we hate each other
A different faith, a different state of mind
That don't mean we all can't be satisfied

Brothers and sisters we are all
Brothers and sisters all and all
Brothers and sisters we are all
Brothers and sisters all and all

Brothers and sisters
Brothers and sisters we are all
Brothers and sisters
Brothers and sisters we are all
