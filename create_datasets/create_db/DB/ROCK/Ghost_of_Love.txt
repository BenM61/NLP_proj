I am near you
You don't see me
Can you feel me
I'm closer than close

Does it hurt?
Does it burn?
Do you know
What you've lost?
Are you scared of the dark?

Now that you're gone
All that remains
Is the ghost of love
Deep in my mind
I hear the chains
Of the ghost of love

You are falling
Down underneath
You'll be crawling
Lower than low

Can you sleep
Can you breathe
When you know
What you've done?
Tell me where will you run

Now that you're gone
All that remains
Is the ghost of love
Deep in my mind
I hear the chains
Of the ghost of love

You were flawless
Cruel and thoughtless
And all that you left me
Is the Ghost of love

I'm fading
I'm barely breathing
Can't hold on
I'm dying
I must be bleeding
Won't be long

Now that you're gone
All that remains
Is the ghost of love
Deep in my mind
I hear the chains
Of the ghost of love
