This bitter earth
What fruit it bears
What good is love
That no one shares
And if my life is like the dust
That hides the glow of a rose
What good am I
Heaven only knows

I wanna tell you
This bitter Earth

Can it be so cold
Today you're young
Too soon your old
But while a voice
A voice Within me cries
someone May answer my call
And this bitter earth
May not be so bitter after all
