Five foot two, eyes of blue
But oh, what those five foot could do
Has anybody seen my girl?
Turned up nose, turned down hose
Never had no other beaus
Has anybody seen my girl?
Now if you run into a 
Five foot two, covered with fur
Diamond rings and all those things
Betcha' life it isn't here
But could she love, could she woo?
Could she, could she, could she coo?
Has anybody seen my girl?
