Far away from God
I had sorrow in my bosom
And my way was mighty hard

Then I heard that gospel story
How He came down from His throne in glory
He paid the debt
I know He paid the debt for you and me

He paid the debt, Jesus paid the debt
He paid the debt, He paid the debt
I know He paid the debt
He paid the, the debt for you and me

You know He's stretched out on a tree
And died on rugged Calvary
That's why I know
Jesus paid the debt for you and me

(Paul)
He paid the debt
Paid the debt
Paid the debt
Oh, yeah
Oh, it was

Jesus paid the debt a long time ago
You know they stretched Him on a tree
On rugged Calvary
Jesus paid the debt for you and me

Jesus paid the debt
For the [unverified]
Jesus paid the debt
It was Jesus He died way out on Cavalry

You know they stretched Him
On a tree on rugged Calvary
You know that Jesus, who paid
Yes, who paid the debt
