Popping, stopping, hopping like a rabbit
When I take the Nina Ross ya know I gotta ta have it
I lay back in the cut retain myself
Think about the shit, and I'm thinking wealth
How can I makes my grip
And how should I make that nigga straight slip
Set trip, gotta get him for his grip
As I dip around the corner, now I'm on a-nother
Mission, wishing, upon a star
Snoop Doggy Dogg with the caviar
In the back of the limo no demo, this is the real
Breaking niggas down like Evander Holyfield, chill
To the next Episode
I make money, and I really don't love hoes
Tell ya the truth, I swoop in the Coupe
I used to sell loot, I used to shoot hoops
But now I, make, hits, every single day
With, that nigga, the diggy Dr. Dre
So lay back in the cut, motherfucker 'fore you get shot
It's 1-8-7 on a motherfucking cop

Boy it's getting hot, yes indeed it is
Snoop Dogg on the mic I'm about as crazy as Biz
Markie, spark the, chronic bud real quick
And let me get into some fly gangsta shit
Yeah, I lay back, stay back in the cut
Niggas try to play the D-O-G like a mutt
I got a little message, don't try to see Snoop
I'm fin to f*ck a bitch, what's her name it's Luke
You tried to see me, on the TV, you'se a B.G.
D-O-double-G, yes I'ma O.G.
You can't see my homey Dr. Dre
So what the f*ck a nigga like you gotta say
Gotta take a trip to the MIA
And serve your ass with a motherfucking AK
You, can't, see, the D-O-double-G, 'cause that be me
I'm serving um, swerving in the Coupe
The Lexus, flexes, from Long Beach to Texas
Sexist, hoes, they want to get with his
'Cause Snoop Dogg is the shit, bitch!

I'm somewhat brain boggled
So I look to the microphone and slowly start to wobble
Grab it, have it, stick it to the plug
It's Snoop, Doggy, I got a got a fat dub
Sack of the chronic in my back pocket loc
Need myself a lighter so I can't take a smoke
I toke everyday, I loc everyday
With the P-O-you-N-D and my nigga Dr. Dre
Lay back in the cut, like I told your ass
Gimme the microphone and let me hit you with a blast
I got a little cousin by the name of Daz
And bitches who f*ck him, gimme the ass
'Cause they know about the shit that we be going through
And they know about the shit that I be putting up
And they be knowing bout the shit I do when I'm on the mic
'Cause Snoop Dogg is Trump tight like a virgin, the surgeon
Is Dr. Drizzay, so lizzay, and plizzay
With D-O-double-Gizzay the fly human being seeing
No I'm not European being all I can
When I put the motherfucking mic in my hand, and
You don't understand when I'm kicking
'Cause Snoop is on the mic and I gets wicked, follow me
Listen to me, 'cause I do you like you want to be done
Snoop Doggy Dogg on this three two one, umm
Dumb, diddy-dumb here I come
With the gat and the guitar was strung, I'm
Not that lunatic nigga who you thought I was
When I caught you slipping, I'm gon catch you then I peel your cap
Snapped back, relax
Ya better not be slipping with them deez on the '83 Cadillac
So we gonna smoke a ounce to this
G's up hoes down while you motherfuckers bounce to this
