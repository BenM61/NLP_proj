Used to feel so close to me 
Everything happened so easily 
Life with you is like a dream 
Without you there's no way to be 

I need your devotion 
I need your devotion 

Ready to love but do you want it enough 
Can we find a way to bring it back again
You say you want to love but do you want it enough 
The end of us it never hurt so much 

I need your devotion 
I need your devotion 

Don't leave me in the dark 
Don't leave me this way 
'Cause nothing's making sense today 

I need you in my heart 
I need you to stay 
(I need your love) 

I need your devotion 
I need your devotion 

Running away are you running to me
Running away are you running to me
Running away are you running to me
Running away are you running to me
Running away are you running to me
Running away are you running to me
