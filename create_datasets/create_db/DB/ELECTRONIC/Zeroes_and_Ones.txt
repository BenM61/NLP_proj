Across the world the message flies
Information, truth and lies
It's all yours and it's all mine
You just have to find the time
We're all the same, we share the blame, we play the games
If it's yes or no the decision is easy, it's easy
Zeroes and ones will take us there.
Zeroes and ones will take us there.

This time the revolution will be computerised
You'll know it as you do it
In real time before your eyes
Slip between realities
There's more to this than anything that you or I can see
The world is mine the world is yours and here's the cause
Zeroes and ones will take us there.
Zeroes and ones will take us there.

I've stared into the heart of it all
Seen the pictures on the wall
The beat of a heart
The oceans part and the patterns in my mind

This time, we've split the world once more
There's those that have and that don't in information wars
Wer'e not alone 'cos all is known and it's everywhere, it's everywhere

Zeroes and ones will take us there.
Zeroes and ones will take us there.
Zeroes and ones will take us there.
