I was addicted to her smile
So much temptation in her eyes
I love the way she touched me
Her beauty made me weak
She gave me so much pleasures
She promised everything
I know that she was lying
But I can't resist

I'm searching in the darkness
For my love, she disappeared
She left me without answers
I know she will not return
The night is full of roses
Black roses in my heart
I was to weak to follow her
Now everything falls apart

I was addicted to her smile
So much temptation in her eyes
I love the way she touched me
Her beauty made me weak
She gave me so much pleasures
She promised everything
I know that she was lying
But I can't resist

I'm searching in the darkness
For my love she disappeared
She left me without answers
I know she will not return
The night is full of roses
Black roses in my heart
I was to weak to follow her
Now everything falls apart

I'm to weak to carry on
I leave the world
There's nothing wrong
I have to pay the price for love
Black roses in my heart
I choose the way into the night
I never saw the light
But now it's shining like the stars
I want to close my eyes
