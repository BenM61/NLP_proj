When am I gonna make a living?
It's gonna take a while before I give in.
See the people fussing and thieving.
While the sharks are wheeling and dealing.

Gotta look up and tell yourself,
There's no end to what you can do.
They'll waste your body and soul if you allow them to.
This is time to start believing in yourself.
Put the blame on no one else.

When am I gonna make a living?
It's gonna take a while before I give in.
See the people fussing and stealing.
Too many lies, no one is achieving.

Haven't I told you before,
"We're hungry for a life we can't afford."
There's no end to what you can do.
If you give yourself a chance to prove.

We're hungry but we won't give in.
Hungry but we won't give in.
Hungry but we won't give in.
Hungry but we won't give in.
Hungry but we won't give in.
We're hungry but we won't give in.
Hungry but we won't give in.
Hungry but we won't give in.

Oh there's no end to what you can do.
They'll waste your body and soul if you allow them to.
Oh start believing in yourself.
Put the blame on no one else.

When am I gonna make a living?.
It's gonna take a while before I give in. Yes it is.
I'm sick and tired of scratching a living.
I am hungry but I'm not gonna give in, no

We're hungry but we won't give in.
Hungry but we won't give in.
Hungry but we won't give in.
Hungry but we won't give in.
Hungry but we won't give in.
Hungry but we won't give in.
Hungry but we won't give in.
Hungry but we're gonna win.
