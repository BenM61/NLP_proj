They say it's all in the mind but
I say it's not, I say it's reality
Looking at these walls 48 hours
White walls, bright white walls
40 hours
But I can see the color in those white walls
There's no black, there's no white
We all one
They lock me up for 48 hours
Bright white walls
Bright white walls
Bright white walls
Bright white walls

Bright white walls
Bright white walls
Bright white walls
Bright white walls
Bright white walls

You can lose your mind
You can lose your mind
You can lose your mind
You can lose your mind
You can lose your mind
You can lose your mind
You can lose your mind
You can lose your mind
You can lose your mind
You can lose your mind
You can lose your mind
You can lose your mind
