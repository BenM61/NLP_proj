Sunshine on your upturned face,
Everything falls into place
Blue sky above, sand underfoot
The happiest I have seen you look.
Sunrise stirs the low landscape,
More beauty than your breath can take,
Boats out to sea, gulls in the air,
I might look as if I didn't care.
Careful with me, careful with my heart,
The world keeps turning, my world falls apart,
When you're out of reach from me
When you're out of reach from me
Fool or wise no in between
I've been both and I can't win
If this love should suffer sudden death,
It won't be because I'm not myself
I don't forget
I depend upon
The simple fact you turn my heart
Over, over, over, over, over.
Careful with me, careful with my heart,
The world keeps turning, my world falls apart,
When you're out of reach from me
When you're out of reach from me
