Midijunkies gonna f*ck you up!

Rage out! no more heroes in the game our trip to the top -
Your chance to win is a chance to lose everything!
Speed! you just wouldn't believe it!
Things get really wierd...
The new video will be as strange as atr
Atari teenage riot to me means more
Than being a number in "everybody's charts"!
Where the hell is the philosophy of punk?
F*ck off cross over! well, could you resist?
Could you resist money? in the name of hate?

Midijunkies gonna f*ck your world! midijunkies gonna f*ck you up! (x4)

Tv and radio say you should do this you should do that!
That's not the kind of program this is!
Let's face it ... the atari is always one step ahead! riot!
Atr ... yesterday becomes 2 days before!
Atari teenage riot! remixing the system!
They go slow and we go fast! beat them up!
Atari teenage riot means more to me
Than being number one in "everybody's charts"!
Where the hell is the philosophy of punk?
F*ck off cross over! well, could you resist?
Could you resist money? in the name of hate?
The dictionary defines heroes as having superior qualities...
And don't forget: a hero is a man who stands up! go!
Midijunkies gonna f*ck your world! midijunkies gonna f*ck you up! (x4)
Midijunkies! midijunkies! (x8)
