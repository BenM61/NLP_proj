Come on little baby got me in a trance
We're both tough so let's just skip the dance
You're lookin' good and I really wanna be with you

Twist action will be good enough
I need a dose of that righteous stuff
I need a little lovin' but fast so baby come on through

I gotta get some time with you alone
Grab onto somethin' I call my own
Ain't got too much time to spare
Come on do the twist action now or I'll be outta here, now

A pretty little girl gotta rock 'n' roll
To get your hand into my pocket is my only goal
The only thing guaranteed is your satisfaction

I got a stiff proposition baby, clench your fist
I'm on a mission to make you twist
Go baby driver gotta get twist action

I gotta get some time with you alone
Grab onto somethin' I call my own
Ain't got too much time to spare
Come on do the twist action now or I'll be outta here, okay

I gotta get some time with you alone
Grab onto somethin' I call my own
Ain't got too much time to spare
Come on do the twist action now or I'll be outta here, girl
Come on do the twist action now or I'll be outta here, girl
Do the twist action now or I'll be outta here, girl
