I found that love provides the key
Unlocks the heart and souls of you and me
Love will learn to sing your song
Love is written in the stone

Every man, I meet is walking time
Free to wander, past his conscious mind
Love will come and take you home
Love is written in the stone

Do you believe, my friend, in what you claim
People of the world, all doubt the same
Bringing questions of their own
Truth is written in the stone

In the stone, you'll find the meaning
You're not standing tall
In the stone the light is shining
Ever touching all

Life experience a passing day
Time will witness, what the ole folks say
Getting stronger every day
Strength is written in the stone

Deep inside your hearts for you to keep
Lies a spark of light that never sleeps
The greatest love you've ever known
Yeah is written in the stone

In the stone, you'll find the meaning
You're not standing tall
In the stone the light is shining
Ever touching all

Never, never my darling, never you'll be alone
Never, never my darling, never you'll be alone
Ever forever my darling
True love is written in the stone

Never, never my darling, never you'll be alone
Ever forever my darling
True love is written in the stone

Never, never my darling, never you'll be alone
Ever forever my darling
True love is written in the stone

Never
Ever
Written in the stone

Never
Written in the stone

Never
