Well, you're the cutest thing that I did ever see 
I really love your peaches, want to shake your tree.
Lovey dovey , lovey dovey all the time 
Lovey dovey, I can't get you out of my mind. 
Every time you kiss me you just thrill me so 
Don't never, never, never, never let me go. 
Oh lovey , lovey dovey all the time 
Lovey dovey, I can't get you out of my mind. 
I sigh with the feeling when you are near me 
I'm high as a ceiling, oh baby hear me 
Cause I'm saying that I love you, place none above you, 
Give it up, pretty mama, I can't wait, because 
My love is tumblin' down, you know I feel the mood 
For you my darlin' I would break my mama's rule 
Ooh lovey , lovey dovey all the time 
Lovey dovey, I can't get you out of my mind.
