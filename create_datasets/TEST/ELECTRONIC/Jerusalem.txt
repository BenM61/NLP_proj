Ran down and the lady said it
It got torn down 
And the priest just said
It got burned
They give me five years five years
It's my turn

Ran down and the lady said it
It got torn down 
And the priest just said
It got burned
They give me five years five years
It's my turn

Oh Jerusalem
Oh Jerusalem

Getting tired of you doing this to me
I'm gonna hit you if you say that to me
One more time
I want to see you 
And you're saying you're busy
I want to stop it 
And you said it would be easy
It sure takes time

Hope your next time 
Gonna be the last time
Hope you don't two-time
It'll be the best time
There won't be no next time
It's show time
I hope you do
What you said
When you swore
You'd make it better
Deliver all the letters
On time

Jerusalem
Jerusalem

Jerusalem
Jerusalem

Jerusalem
