(Nine deuce, black
Nine deuce, black
Nine deuce, black Eldorado
Nine deuce
Nine deuce, black Eldorado)

I'm in a nine deuce, black Eldorado
Deep dishes barely fitting on this Eldorado
Limited editon, triple black, triple terra
Ain't nobody got this, not nobody from my era
She ain't got no door handles or no sideview mirrors
We get attention anytime we make an appearance
Something we love to do
Me, my Eldorado, and you, baby

But you don't ride with me no more
My hands all on your thighs, passenger side of me no more
I've been rolling alone 'cause you probably don't want to ride with me no more
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh
Forgot you're a saint, girl, I am still a sinner
I'm just rolling alone, rolling alone, rolling alone
Rolling alone, rolling alone, rolling alone
Ride with me, ride with me, ride with me

I'm in a nine deuce, black Eldorado
[?] skimpy-looking flat, I need some air though
Limited edition, triple black, triple terra
Ain't nobody got this, in my city or my area
She ain't got no door handles or no sideview mirrors
We get attention anytime we make an appearance
Something we love to do
Me, my Eldorado, and you

But you don't ride with me no more
My hands all on your thighs, passenger side of me no more
I've been rolling alone 'cause you probably don't want to ride with me no more
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh
Forgot you're a saint, girl, I am still a sinner
I'm just rolling alone, rolling alone, rolling alone
Rolling alone, rolling alone, rolling alone
Ride with me, ride with me, ride with me
