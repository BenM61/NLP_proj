Put a man on Mars today
It wasn't the first time
I've seen it all before
Took my hat off in the rain today
It wasn't the first time
I've seen it all before

Trust you
Trust you
Trust you to know everything about me
Trust you
Trust you
Trust you to know everything about me all along

And the coffee is medicine
It's hard to remember
I've seen it all before
And the picture at the factory floor
Rats in a suitcase
I've seen it all before

Trust you
Trust you
Trust you to know everything about me
Trust you
Trust you
Trust you to know everything about me all along

Put a man on Mars today
It wasn't the future
I've seen it all before

Trust you trust you trust you to know everything about me
Trust you trust you trust you to know everything about me all along

All along
All along
All along
