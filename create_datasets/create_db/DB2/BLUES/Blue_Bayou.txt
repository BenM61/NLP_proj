I feel so bad I've got a worried mind
I'm so lonesome all the time
Since I left my baby behind on blue bayou

Savin' nickels, savin' dimes
Workin' till the sun don't shine
Lookin' forward to happier times on blue bayou

I'm goin' back some day, come what may, to blue bayou
Where you sleep all day and the catfish play on blue bayou
All those fishin' boats with their sails afloat, if I could only see
That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes how happy I'd be

Oh, to see my baby again
And to be with some of my friends
Maybe I'd be happy then on blue bayou

I'm goin' back some day, gonna stay on blue bayou
Where the folks are fine and the world is mine on blue bayou
Ah, that girl of mine by my side
The silver moon and the evening tide
Ah, some sweet day gonna take away this hurtin' inside

I'll never be blue, my dreams come true on blue bayou
