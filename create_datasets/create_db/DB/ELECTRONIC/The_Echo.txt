Drifting gardens
Eruptions
Fly over scandal
Hidden princes, ambassadors,
Kings, queens and apprentices
Cloud castles in between
Fantasy and reality,
Fantasy and reality

The last piece is in between, in a clear blow
Not ending alliance
I hear the buzzing, the echo, the echo, the echo, the echo

Definitive number, twisted trunk
For the first time
I can recognise
No screaming, it is a lullaby

The last piece is in between, in a clear blow
Not ending alliance
I hear the buzzing, the echo, the echo, the echo, the echo

The last piece is in between
Not ending alliance, I'll have to understand
No timing this time
It is a lullaby

I began to find
Whisper in my mind

The last piece is in between, in a clear blow
Not ending alliance
I hear the buzzing, the echo, the echo, the echo, the echo

The last piece is in between
Not ending alliance, I'll have to understand
No timing this time
It is a lullaby

I began to find
Whisper in my mind
