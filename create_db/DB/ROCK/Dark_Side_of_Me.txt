In those discouraging days
I always missed the mark
When we were comfort and close
I would neglect to keep

Oh, you safe and unexposed
A portrait of time repeats
This moment now replaced
With an empty wish to give
I give, I gave

I gave my everything
For all the wrong things
In this cold reality I made
This selfish war machine

Oh, this has become hell
How can I share this life
With someone else?
I promise you
There is no weight that can bury us
Beneath the ghosts of all my guilt

Here in the dark side of me
Here in the dark side of me

Now in your absence I wade
Through the coursing, lonely, lost
And in this tragic dismay
I never could believe what I became

I gave my everything
For all the wrong things
In this cold reality I made
This welcomed war machine

Oh, this has become hell
How can I share this life
With someone else?
I promise you
There is no weight that can bury us
Beneath the ghosts of all my guilt

Here in the dark side of me
Here in the dark side of me
Here in the dark side of me
Here in the dark side of me

Oh, I couldn't give you
What you needed
It's all my fault
Too coward to believe I lost it all

I gave my everything
For all the wrong things
In this cold reality I made
This selfish war machine

Oh, this has become hell
How can I share this life
With someone else?
I promise you
There is no weight that can bury us
Beneath the ghosts of all my guilt

Here in the dark side of me
Here in the dark side of me
Here in the dark side of me
Here in the dark side of me
