Girl you wanna know whats up
I can truly say that I love you
And we know that love is not puffed up
So there are things
In love that you'll never do

I would never jump off a building and survive
And if that building were burning up
I'd never leave you inside
I'd probably never live to see a hundred years old
And no matter who's around I'd never
Treat you cold

I will never lie to you baby boo
I will never treat you untrue (no no)
They say never say what you wouldn't do (wouldn't do)
I can say I'll say never, I will never hurt you

So you wanna be, made secure
Never give your heart unless, you were sure
Just wanna know, where I'm at
Me leaving you girl, never that
I can never fight, a hundred men and win
And I've never known the beauty of a girl, in a friend
They say never say, what you wouldn't do
But they never been in love with a girl like you

I will never lie to you baby boo
I will never treat you untrue ( no no no no no no)
They say never say never (They say never)
I can say I'll never (you can trust me
When I say I'll never) yeah

(Oh oh oh oh oh)

How would you know ,what you would and
Would not do, but here is what I say it,
(here is what I say)
Until my dying day
I will never stop loving you

I will never lie to you baby boo
I will never treat you untrue (no no)
They say never say what you wouldn't do (wouldn't do)
I can say I'll say never, I will never hurt you
