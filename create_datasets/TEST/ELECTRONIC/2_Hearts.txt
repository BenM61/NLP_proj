A touch too much, too soon,
Got cast away with you.
Got cast away with you.
Your words, can't hear, cause they hurt,
Can't spend another day with you.
Can't stand another day with you.

These two hearts won't make it last.
These two hearts won't make it last.
It's like you are hopelessly in love,
But I will watch you.
It's like you are hopelessly in love.

Don't move, just close your eyes,
I grab your hands and then (x2
You see, although you've been blind,
I saved your world again.
Just saved your world again.

These two hearts won't make it last.
These two hearts won't make it last.
It's like you are hopelessly in love,
But I will watch you.
It's like you are hopelessly in love.
But it's okay, okay,
'Cause I will stay with you.

You don't need much operation done,
You want the moon but you've got the sun.
You don't need much operation done,
Too much, too soon, for a bit of fun.

These two hearts won't make it last.
These two hearts won't make it last.
These two hearts won't make it last.
But it's okay, okay,
'Cause I will stay with you.
