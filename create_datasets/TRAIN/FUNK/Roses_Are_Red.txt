I'll do anything to prove to you I care for you

Even if I have to catch a falling star.
'Cause to me you are the flower of my heart.

Girl
I love you for being you
And the special way you always touch my heart
Girl

I'll be your adrenalin all and all!

Roses are red
Violets are blue
Baby

It's love you!

And when I think about the things that you have done for me

It explains why you're the apple of my eye.

And I'll be there if ever you call
