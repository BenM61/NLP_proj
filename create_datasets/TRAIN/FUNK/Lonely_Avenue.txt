Now my room has got two windows
But the sunshine never comes through
You know it's always dark and dreary
Since I broke off, baby with you

I live on a lonely avenue
My little girl wouldn't say I do
Well, I feel so sad and blue
And it's all because of you

I could cry, I could cry, I could cry (ooh)
I could die, I could die, I could die (I need help from somebody)
Because I live on a lonely avenue
(Lonely avenue) oh, yes sir

Now you know my covers they feel like lead
And my pillow it feels like stone
Well, I've tossed and turned so every night
I'm not used to being alone

I live on a lonely avenue
My little girl wouldn't say I do
Well, I feel so sad and blue
You know it's all because of you

I could cry, I could cry, I could cry (oh)
I could die, I could die, I could die (oh)
'Cause I live on a lonely avenue
Yes, sir (Lonely avenue)

Lonely avenue
Lonely avenue

Now I've been so sad and lonesome
Since you've left this town
You know if I could beg or borrow the money
Child, I would be a highway bound

I live on a lonely avenue
My little girl wouldn't say I do
Well, I feel so sad and blue
You know its all because of you

I could cry, I could cry, I could cry (oh)
I could die, I could die, I could die (yeah)
I live on a lonely avenue
(Lonely avenue)
