There is one in a million like you
A dream in a million come true
I confess that I really don't know why
But I know that I glow like I do

Only once in a lifetime is par
To find someone rare as you are
But now you're around
I have really found
That there's one in a million like you

Fate was surely kind to help my heart find
Someone like you to be my love
I give thanks each day
That you came my way
Way out of heaven to try love

Yes once in a lifetime you know
Above heaven started below
Though it may be rare
You and I will share
This love that has happened to few
For there's one in a million like you

Fate was surely kind to help my heart find
Someone like you to be my love
I give thanks each day
That you came my way
Way out of heaven to try love

Yes once in a lifetime you know
Above heaven started below
Though it may be rare
You and I will share
This love that has happened to few
For there's one in a million like you
