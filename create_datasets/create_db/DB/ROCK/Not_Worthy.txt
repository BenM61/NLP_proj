Rollin' and a rockin' on a late night
Trying to beat the devil at a fist fight
Looking for a friend in a bottle of red
Making up a word that's never been said

Waiting in line for the next fine
Making up a rhyme but it don't rhyme
Baby, I'm a loser at this game
If you could see me now, you'd be ashamed of me
Be ashamed of me

Cause I'm not worthy of your love
I'm barely keeping up
Feels like every single day, all I ever do is say I'm sorry
I guess that I'm not worthy of your love

Every night living like a runaway
Trying to make it back for the break of day
I never learn from my mistakes
So much for my great escape

Put my future on the back burner
Grew up fast but I'ma slow learner
Only got myself to blame
If you could see me now, you'd be ashamed of me
So ashamed of me

Cause I'm not worthy of your love
I'm barely keeping up
Feels like every single day, all I ever do is say I'm sorry
I guess that I'm not worthy of your love

How could you possibly love someone like me?
A fool I'll always be

I'm not worthy of your love
I'm barely keeping up
Feels like every single day, all I ever do is say I'm sorry
I guess that I'm not worthy of your love
