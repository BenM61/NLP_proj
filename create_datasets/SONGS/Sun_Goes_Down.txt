Nothings ever what we expect
But they keep asking where I go next
Oh, we're chasing as the sun set
Got my mind on you

Doesn't matter where we are are are are
Doesn't matter where we are are are are
Doesn't matter, no

If there's a moment when it's perfect
We'll carve our names as the sun goes down
Yeah
As the sun goes down
Yeah
As the sun goes down

As the sun goes down

Doesn't matter where we are are are are
Doesn't matter where we are are are are
Doesn't matter, no

We were, wash around me now
We were, wash around me now
