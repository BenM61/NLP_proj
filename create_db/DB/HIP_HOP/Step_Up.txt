Girls step up to the party
Grab a boy and move your body
Do like me and my honey

My body just felt it I knew,
Tonight is the start of
Something new
The way you dance, makes we wanna
Get down and show you
That we can become one, not two
As we move to this beat like crazy

Move it, move it, move it, move it
Let's rock it, rock it, rock it, rock it
We can even pop it, pop it, pop it
Tonight is on
Woo!

Turn around on one two (say:
Oh oh oh oh oh ooh)
