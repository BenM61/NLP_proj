She's like a stellar
She's got a fella
She knows Italian too
She just started driving you

I feel I know the man on Mir
I'd love to see what he can see
The black and grey that share his sleep
Alone, alone
Butterfly in cocoon

I've lost my way
I want my way
To see the green and white and blue
See the Great Wall
See me and you

I feel I know the man on Mir
I'd love to see what he can see
The black and grey that share his sleep
Alone, alone
Butterfly in cocoon
