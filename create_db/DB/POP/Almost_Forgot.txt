Sometimes I get confused
'Bout how it all went down
When I feel like I miss you
I just try to block it out

Still remember when we moved into that place too soon
When we paid too much 'cause we loved the view
When we just met, and it didn't make sense
But you said forever, and I did too, too, too
F*ck

I almost forgot about you breaking my heart
I almost forgot what I went through
Left out the most important part
It got really bad, we lost what we had
I almost forgot about you
I almost forgot (I almost forgot)
I almost forgot (I almost forgot)

You're still affectin' my mood
I never let it show (I never let it show)
I know you're feeling it too
It's hard to let it go

I remember when I moved out
And you chased me down
Yelling, "don't forget all that we've been through"
But that's just it, yeah I'm sick of this shit
I don't want forever if it's with you, you, you
F*ck

I almost forgot about you breaking my heart
I almost forgot what I went through
Left out the most important part
It got really bad, we lost what we had
I almost forgot about you
I almost forgot (I almost forgot)

I almost forgot (I almost forgot)
I almost forgot (I almost forgot)
