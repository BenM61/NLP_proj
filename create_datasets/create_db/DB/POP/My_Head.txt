No, I know what you said
But that doesn't mean that I understand
And you don't know what I meant by that
But it's sweet that you tried
That you're on my side

If you were my head
You'd know where it hurts
You'd clean up the dirt
If you were my head
I would be heard

As close, as close as we'll get
We touch and it's gone
I must have been wrong when I thought
Everything melts in us
Though sometimes it does

If you were my head
You'd know where it hurts
You'd clean up the dirt
If you were my head
I would be heard

No, I'll never be you
But I don't need to
As long as you love me like you

If you were my head
You'd know where it hurts
You'd clean up the dirt
And I would be heard

If you were my head
You'd know where it hurts
You'd clean up the dirt
If you were my head
I would be heard
