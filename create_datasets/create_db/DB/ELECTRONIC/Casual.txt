I used to call you after midnight
It was cool 'cause we both agreed
We were easy, kinda weakly
Just a friend sleeping next to me

Feel like we're loving but my body not my heart
I guess we weren't good at keepin' them apart
Now you say you love me and the feeling's mutual
But what the hell, I thought we said

Let's keep it casual
Let's keep it casual

I was sleeping in your T-shirt
With your hands wrapped around my waist
And you call me things like baby
And I stayed over every day

Feel like we're loving but my body not my heart
I guess we weren't good at keepin' them apart
Now you say you love me and the feeling's mutual
But what the hell, I thought we said

Let's keep it casual

We tried so hard to be strong, didn't last long
How could we ever resist?
The way that we feel, way that we touch
Shit got me so powerless
Thought we were chill, so what the hell
How did we end up like this?
Only one I wanna kiss, only your name on my lips

Let's keep it casual
Let's keep it casual
How could we be so damn delusional?
'Cause it was always powerful, beautiful

Let's keep it casual
Let's keep it casual
