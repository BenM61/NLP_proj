See a crack in the sky 
Catch the sun as it folds 
Swim the waves in your eyes 
Keeps me rushing 
Rushing out to shore 

Found a place in the scion 
A place we live and you don't 
As we float from a wealth that is breathless 
No ones frightened anymore 

And we couldn't care 
If we die here, die here 
And we couldn't care 
If they flick the switch 
And took the rest of this 

In Pala 
In Pala 
In Pala 
In Pala 

See the flash in the dark 
Breathe the rest of your sigh 
Hold the rush of a life 
Keep me coming 
Coming back for more 

You feel the lust of a lion 
The one who runs at you cold 
When you start with a look that's endless 
Pits me up against the wall 

And we couldn't care 
If we die here, die here 
And we couldn't care 
If they flick the switch 
And took the rest of this 

In Pala 
In Pala 
In Pala 
In Pala 

It's so quiet here 
Breathing life up here 

In Pala 
In Pala 
In Pala 
In Pala
