Yeah, you can pick me up, baby
And put me back, back on my feet again
I've made this life of mine sweet again
Yes, you got what it takes
To end all the heartaches

Pick me up, baby
And put me back, back on my feet again
I've made this life of mine sweet again
Yes, you got what it takes
To end all the heartaches

In my life, there's been nobody
Who ever cared a bit about me
I was the one guy deserving love
But every time it seemed to be found
To be the one guy, rightly hurt in love
Who ended up flat on the ground
(Flat on the ground)

You can pick me up, baby
And put me back, back on my feet again
I've made this life of mine sweet again
Yes, you got what it takes
To end all the heartaches

Pick me up, baby
And put me back, back on my feet again
I've made this life of mine sweet again
Yes, you got what it takes
To end all the heartaches

Tried so hard to take it cool and easy
When everything seems to go wrong
I was the one guy deserving love
But every time it seemed to be found
To be the one guy, rightly hurt in love
Who ended up flat on his back
(Flat on his back)

You can pick me up, baby
And put me back, back on my feet again
I've made this life of mine sweet again
Yes, you got what it takes
To end all the heartaches

Pick me up, baby
And put me back, back on my feet again
I've made this life of mine sweet again
Yes, you got what it takes
