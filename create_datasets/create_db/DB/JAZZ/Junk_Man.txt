I'm gonna give that junk man my broken heart
The broken heart I got from you
I'm gonna give that junk man my broken heart
For a loaded thirty-two

I'm gonna give that junk man my old gladrags
I'm gonna wear a gown of black
Better pack your trunk man, pack your bags
Cause I'm gettin' on your track

Now I ain't braggin'
You can't throw me down
I'm gonna fix your wagon
So you can't go to town

I'm gonna do you right cause you done me wrong
I'm gonna do you black and blue
And then I'll tell that junk man to come along
And pick up what's left of you
