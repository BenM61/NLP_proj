 Oh, the blues got ways sometimes just like a natural man 
 I don't care which away you turn, they always is on your hands 
 Won't you tell me, baby, how come you don't come back home? 
 Won't you tell me, baby, how come you don't come back home? 
 I lay down last night with my back door open all night long 
 Here come the blues this morning, just 'fore day they shut my door 
 Here come the blues this morning, just 'fore day they s hut my door 
 But the lord forgive me, I won't have them things no more 
 This morning, setting on the side of my bed 
 This morning, setting on the side of my bed 
 (They done come) brought you a letter (for) your plumb good man fell dead 
 (spoken: Blues, what must I do?) 
 Hmmmmm, hmmmmm 
 Hmmmmm, hmmmmm
