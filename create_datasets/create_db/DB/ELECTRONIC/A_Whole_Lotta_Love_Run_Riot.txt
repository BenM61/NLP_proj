She was still a movie star when the lights went out
Ooh-ah-ah, she had such a glittering career
Ooh-ooh-oh, she could never memorize her opening lines
Ooh-ah-ah, couldn't understand why they would leave

A whole lotta
(A whole lotta love run
All my lovin' tonight)

A whole lotta love
Will see you later
Ain't nothing but a come
Will make it right
A whole lotta love
Will see you later
Ain't nothing but a come
My lovin' tonight

She was on another psychic frequency
Ooh-ah-ah, just as well the brakes went out on the car
Her hands were tied with velvet rope behind her back
Ooh-ah-ah, the causes have become her guilty cage

A whole lotta
(A whole lotta love run
All my lovin' tonight)

A whole lotta love
Will see you later
Ain't nothing but a come
Will make it right
A whole lotta love
Will see you later
Ain't nothing but a come
My lovin' tonight

A whole lotta love run
No more lovin' tonight

She ain't no love
We'll see you later
We've had it up to here
With your strange behavior
A whole lotta love
Ain't nothing but a come tonight
