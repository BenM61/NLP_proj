The clock stopped running, darling
When you went away
The sun stops shining
And the clouds turn to gray

To me I can't see nothing in the daze
While your are gone

The birds did bow their heads
'Cause they all seem to know
How much I love you, dear
And wanted you so

No, there isn't no place I'd want to go
While you are gone, gone

I didn't realize how precious love could be
Now it is plain enough to see
To think that I could live
In this big cruel world by myself
Loving you so much, longing for your touch

I know I'm just a fool who didn't play her part
To cause us, darling, to be so far apart
So how can I repair these broken hearts
While you are gone

How can I repair these broken hearts
While you are gone
