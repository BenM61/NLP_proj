One little kiss
Led to another and another and another
Then, ooh, I wanted you
And I feel those good vibrations
Deep inside my soul
Telling me that you're my goal.

But if I'm stepping out of line
If my words don't seem to rhyme
It's because I'm falling head over heels in love with you
Darling, please don't turn away
Open your heart and let me stay
And I will find a way.

Oh, trying to get to you
Is like trying to get a little cat down from the top of a tree
You're scared of me
But believe my ladder to love
Is strong and it will never break
Your little heart will be safe.

But if I'm stepping out of line
If my words don't seem to rhyme
It's because I'm falling head over heels in love with you
Darling, please don't be afraid
Open your heart and let me stay
And I will find a way.

But if I'm stepping out of line
If my words don't seem to rhyme
It's because I'm falling head over heels in love with you
Darling, please don't be afraid
Open your heart and let me stay
And I will find a way.

But if I'm stepping out of line
If my words don't seem to rhyme
It's because I'm falling head over heels in love with you
Darling, please don't be afraid
Open your heart and let me stay
And I will find a way into your heart, girl.
