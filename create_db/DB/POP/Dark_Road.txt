It's a dark road
And a dark way that leads to my house
And the word says you're never gonna find me there, oh no
I've got an open door
It didn't get there by itself
It didn't get there by itself

There's a feelin'
But you're not feelin' it at all
There's a meaning
But you're not listening anymore
I look at that open road
I'm gonna walk there by myself

And if you catch me I might try to run away
You know I can't be here too long
And if you let me I might try to make you stay
Seems you never realize a good thing till it's gone

Maybe I'm still searchin' but I don't know what it means

All the fires of destruction are still burnin' in my dreams
There's no water that can wash away this longin' to come clean

Hey yeah yeah

I can't find the joy within in my soul
It's just sadness takin' hold
I wanna come in from the cold
And make myself renewed again (I wanna go livin' I wanna come renewed) 
It takes strength to live this way (oohh)
The same old madness everyday (nooo)
I wanna kick these blues away (kick away now)
I wanna learn to live again

Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey

It's a dark road
And a dark way that leads to my house
And the word says
You're never gonna find me there oh no
I've got an open door
It didn't get there by itself oh
It didn't get there by itself
