Well you took me for a ride
You beat me to the gun
And from the other side
Well you came undone
But when you tell me to
I want to give in
Just like you want me to
Oh oh I'm fallin' through

Oh you better strap me in
All night long
You got to strap me in
All night long
Got to strap me in
All night long
All all all night long

Well you took me by the way
And you showed me what is fun
Just like a ricochet
Uh back you come
And when you tell me to
I want to give it
Just like you want me to
Oh oh I'm falling through

Uh you better strap me in
All night long
You better strap me in
All night long
You better strap me in
All night long
All all all night long

All night then ?

Uh

Well you took me for a ride
Uh you beat me to the gun
And from the other side
Oh well you came undone
And when you tell me to
I want to give in
Just like you want me to
Oh oh I'm fallin' through

Oh better strap me in
All night long
You better strap me in
All night long
Strap me in
All night long
All all
Well you better strap me in
Strap me in
Strap me in
All night long
All night long
