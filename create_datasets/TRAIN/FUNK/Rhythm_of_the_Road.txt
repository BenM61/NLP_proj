Driving down the highway miles from home
It?s been that way since the day we started to roam.
This is what we wanted, hey look what we've got.
Got to leave that little town behind and move on.
Trees line the highway as we roll down the road.
At the wheel twelve tons of steel can be quite a load.
In the distance the city lights are starting to glow.
Sit back and watch them glimmer, they're starting to grow
And the rhythm of the road
Holds the answer to the questions on our minds.
I know that we can keep the faith
And things will all work out in time.
