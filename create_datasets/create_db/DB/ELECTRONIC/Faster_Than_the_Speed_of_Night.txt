I don't want to let another minute get by
They're slipping through our fingers but we're ready to fly
The night'll be our cover and we'll huddle below
We got the music in our bodies and the radio

And when the morning comes It'll all be gone
Disappearing in(to) the crack of dawn
We better make our move now before the sun is awake
It's time to put up or shut up and to pick up the pace

And I don't want to let another minute get by
Love is going to get us while the moon is in the sky
We may be running out of night but never running out of steam
We're acting on a hunch and we'll be acting out a dream

There really isn't any time to lose
They're going to catch us if we wait until it gets too light
You're such a pretty boy
Let me show you what to do and you'll do it
But you gotta move faster
Faster than the speed of night

[Chorus x2]
Faster than the speed of night
Faster than the speed of night
It's all we ever wanted
And all we'll ever need
And it's slipping through our fingers
Faster than the speed of night

Faster than the speed of night
Faster than the speed of night
Faster than the speed of night
Faster than the speed of night

Let me show you how to drive me crazy
Let me show you how to make me feel so good
Let me show you how to take me to the
Edge of the stars and then back again
You've gotta show me how to drive you crazy
You've gotta show me all the things
You want to happen to you
We've gotta tell each other everything
We always wanted someone to do

I don't want to push you now and I don't want to rush
We're getting closer every second but close is not enough
The night'll be our cover and we'll huddle below
We got the music in our fingers and the radio

There really isn't any time to lose
They're going to catch us if we wait until it gets too light
You're such a pretty boy
Let me show you what to do and you'll do it
But you gotta move faster
Faster than the speed of night

[Chorus x2]

Faster than the speed of night
Faster than the speed of night
Faster than the speed of night
Faster than the speed of night
