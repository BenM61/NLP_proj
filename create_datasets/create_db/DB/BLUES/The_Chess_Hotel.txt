In my town, there's a piece of hell
A little dig called The Chess Hotel
You can move on in and be a small town slave
Or you can get out now if you're feeling brave

Shake a little shake
Give a little give
Take a little chance on the run

Don't let no one forget
Don't let mama regret
Give your love and your sweat
'Till you're shining

Make the best of your time
Don't you finish your prime
Give your all and a dime
'Till you're shining

Well, there's Rachel down in room 103
Had her second child at seventeen
She's got every day to figure out
How the babies gonna do without

Shake a little shake
Give a little give
Take a little chance on the run

Don't let no one forget
Don't let mama regret
Give your love and your sweat
'Till you're shining

Make the best of your time
Don't you finish your prime
Give your all and a dime
'Till you're shining

Get on out of the Chess Hotel, get on out
If you escape alive, you're doing well

Get out now, get out now
Get out now, get out now
