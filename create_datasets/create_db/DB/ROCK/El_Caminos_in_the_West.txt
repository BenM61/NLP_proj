So there's my baby
Laughing at me in the sun
Wonder if I'm the weaker one
I feel so far away from home
Always so far away

The Pacific will pacify us when we're done
If only we weren't always spun
I feel so far away from home
Always so far away

From El Caminos in the west
All collapsed and futureless
I'll paint the words a simple wish 
For peace of mind and happiness
El Caminos in the west
We're all collapsed and futureless
I'll paint the words a simple wish
For peace of mind and happiness
 
Doo doo doo

Here comes the chaos
Perfectly on time again
Is it ever gonna end
I feel so far away from home
Always so far away

The demolition still can be a lot of fun
Someone should tell me that I'm done
I feel so far away from home
Always so far away

From El Caminos in the west
All collapsed and futureless
I'll paint the words a simple wish
For peace of mind and happiness
El Caminos in the west
We're all collapsed and futureless
I'll paint the words a simple wish
For peace of mind and happiness
 
Doo doo doo
