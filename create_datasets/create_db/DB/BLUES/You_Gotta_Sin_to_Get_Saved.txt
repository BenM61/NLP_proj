Well, ya been my Romeo ever since we was in school
An every good thing I've ever felt you have made me feel
Well, it's not that I don't love you, I'll love you honey till I die
But I could never be your bride 'til I tame my wicked side

Whoa, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh
Honey, show a little faith, you gotta sin to get saved

Well, I could never shame you honey, you're my pride and joy
But what's a girl to do now, daddy, I'm drowning in a sea of boys
Well, there ain't no harm in looking but I look too close sometimes
I'll never fix my roving eye 'til I tame my wicked side

Whoa, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh
Honey, show a little faith, you gotta sin to get saved

Now I pray the Lord won't scorn me if I make an honest vow
To someday wear a dress of white 'cause scarlet's what I'm wearing now
Well, it's not that I don't love you, I'll love you honey 'til I die
But I could never be your bride 'til I tame my wicked side

Whoa, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh
Honey, show a little faith, you gotta sin to get saved
