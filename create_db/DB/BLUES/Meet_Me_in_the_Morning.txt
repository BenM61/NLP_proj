Meet me in the morning
56th and Wabasha
Meet me in the morning
56th and Wabasha
Honey, we could be in Kansas
By time the snow begins to thaw

They say the darkest hous
Is right before the dawn
They say the darkest hour
Is right before the dawn
But you wouldn't know it by me
Every day's been darkness since you been gone

Little rooster crowin'
There must be something on his mind
Little rooster crowin'
There must be something on his mind
Well, I feel just like that rooster
Honey, ya treat me so unkind

Well, I struggled through barbed wire
Felt the hail fall from above
Well, I struggled through barbed wire
Felt the hail fall from above
Well, you know I even outran the hound dogs
Honey, you know I've earned your love

Look at the sun
Sinkin' like a ship
Look at the sun
Sinkin' like a ship
Ain't that just like my heart, babe
When you kissed my lips?
