Give me the money now reach for the sky
You better believe, when I say I'm gonna bleed you dry
A few dollars more will keep you alive
Get down on the floor if you'd like to survive

Chorus
They're screaming blue murder
I'm scheming to survive
Blood money they want me
Loud hailers screaming dead or alive

There's blood on my face and I'm out on a limb
I'm fighting for life and I don't know if I'm going to win
Sirens are wailing there's no time to waste
They're shooting to kill-get me out of this place

Chorus
They're screaming blue murder
I'm scheming to survive
Blood money they want me
Loud hailers screaming dead or alive

I'm rolling in money I'm down on the floor
Smashing the windows and kicking the doors
They'll take me alive and that's all that I'll fear
They're getting so close but all I can hear is

Chorus
They're screaming blue murder
I'm scheming to survive
Blood money they want me
Loud hailers screaming dead or alive

The bullets are flying all over my head
I aim to escape I don't care whose blood is shed
A shot in the dark with a loaded gun
They're shooting on sight till this war is won

Chorus
They're screaming blue murder
I'm scheming to survive
Blood money they want me
Loud hailers screaming dead or alive

They're screaming blue murder
I'm scheming to survive
Blood money they want me
Loud hailers screaming dead or alive

Repeat

Blue murder
Blue murder
Blue murder
Blue murder
