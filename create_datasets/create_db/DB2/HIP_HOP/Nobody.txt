When you love me
When you hug me

Nobody nobody ever miss me
Nobody nobody's baby is so real
Nobody can make me feel the way you do

(Baby I can't figure it your kiss is just like honey)

It's just the way you make the way you make me feel 
My friends don't understand 
They just don't know the things you do
They think I'm crazy
Give all my lovin to you
Hold me when you love me baby

When you love me
When you hug me
When you squeeze me
When you touch me
When you set me to a place no other has

Nobody nobody ever miss me
Nobody nobody's baby is so real
Nobody can make me feel the way you do

(Baby I can't figure it out your kiss is just like honey) Honey

Sometimes I sit at home
And think that to the time when I was all alone 
When I was lonley
But you came and made my world complete
Come and love me baby

When you love me
When you hug me
When you squeeze me
When you touch me
When you set me to a place no other has

Nobody nobody ever miss me
Nobody nobody's baby is so real
Nobody can make me feel the way you do

(Baby I just can't figure it out your kiss is just like honey)

When I think about the love we give
Baby I can't figure it out your kiss is just like honey
Baby I can't figure it out your kiss is just like honey
Baby I can't figure it out your kiss is just like honey 
Baby I can't figure it out your kiss is just like honey
Baby I can't figure it out your kiss is just like honey
Baby I can't figure it out your kiss is just like honey
