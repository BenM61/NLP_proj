Heaven's down and Hell is up
All rights reversed
Driven by the planets and their movements

Well, down on earth
The primal chaos is pushing backwards
But even in the danger

It never stops and no one stop him
It never stops and no one stop him
It never stops and no one stop him
It never stops and no one stop him

It never stops and no one's talking
All rights reversed
Undertaking copy left for flying sideways

Well, down on earth
The primal chaos is running forwards
And narrow down to quits but

It never stops and no one stop him
It never stops and no one stop him
It never stops and no one stop him
It never stops and no one stop him

It never stops
It never stops

Never stops and no one stop him
Never stops and no one stop him
Never stops and no one stop him
Never stops and no one stop him

Never stops and no one stop him
Never stops and no one stop him
Never stops and no one stop him
Never stops and no one stop him

Never stops and no one stop him
(It never stops)
Never stops and no one stop him
(It never stops)

Never stops and no one stop him
(It never stops)
Never stops and no one stop him
(It never stops)

Never stops and no one stop him
(It never stops and no one stop him)
Never stops and no one stop him
(It never stops and no one stop him)

Never stops and no one stop him
(It never stops and no one stop him)
Never stops and no one stop him
(It never stops and no one stop him)
