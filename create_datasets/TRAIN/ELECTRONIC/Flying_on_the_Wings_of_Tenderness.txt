I guess I'll never understand it
A billion people on this planet
And here I've found the one who's made for me
Just when I thought my hopes had faded
I found the one who was created
To hold my hand and share this world with me
We're flying on the wings of tenderness
Riding the rivers of gentleness
Into the garden of love wi'll flow and watch it grow together
We'll build a castle out of honesty
Fill every room with the harmony
Seeing the world trough each other's eyes
Wi'll live our lives together
I've always hidden my emotions
But now my my heart is free and open
To give to you the love you gave to me
'cause now the sands of time have shifted
And every burden has been lifted
'cause now I know our love will show the way
Refrain
Refrain
