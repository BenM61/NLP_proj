Come to me high
Come to me restless
Come to me cold
Come to me helpless
Defenseless
When you're on your own
(When you're alone in your room)

Heaven is here at your call
But, darling, love is just 
One of those things you have to ask for

Come to me high
Come to me restless
Come to me cold
Come to me helpless
Defenseless
When you're on your own

I see there on your own
Just like the sun,  can't touch the moon
Give me what I've given to me
And forget the way down
Forget the way down
