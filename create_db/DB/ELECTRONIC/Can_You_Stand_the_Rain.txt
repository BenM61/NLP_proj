On a perfect day
I know that I can count on you
When that's not possible
Tell me can you weather the storm
Cause I need somebody who will stand by me
Through the good times and bad
She will always, always be right there
Sunny days
Everybody loves them
Tell me
Can you stand the rain
Storms will come
This we know for sure
Can you stand the rain
Love unconditional
I'm not asking this of you
We've got to make it last
I'll do whatever needs to be done
Cause I need somebody who will stand by me
Through the good times and bad times
She will always, always be right there
Sunny days
Everybody loves them
Tell me
Can you stand the rain
Storms will come
This we know for sure
Can you stand the rain
Can you stand the rain
Can you stand the rain
Can you stand the rain
Can you stand the rain
No pressure
No pressure from me baby
Cause I want you
And I need you
And I love you
Will you be there for me?
Can you stand the rain?
Can you stand the rain?
Can you stand the rain?
Can you stand the rain?
Can you stand the rain?
Can you stand the rain?
