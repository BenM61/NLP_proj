Now when I'm down on the microphone stand
I give you all the dope lyrics and
Introducing the band
To make you understand
How this is planned, I demand
A microphone to rock the home boys
With an instrumental to make noise
Yo, I rock the home girls too
I'll explain the name of the crew, yo

This beat is, this beat is
This beat is Technotronic
This beat is Technotronic

And Eric's got lyrics for ya
I saw ya posse
But now it's me who's bossing
So I give the orders around here
You don't wanna get sacked so be
A good party goer, get the floor ready
And yaself ready, huh, I rock steady
Like a rock and I won't stop
Till it's at the top and the suckers drop to hop to it
Yo, they couldn't do it, to get more to the point they blew it
But not like ya blowing the speaker
They can't go on because they're weaker

This beat is, this beat is
This beat is Technotronic
This beat is Technotronic
This beat is Technotronic
This beat is, this beat is
This beat is Technotronic
This beat is Technotronic
There's the dance floor, get on it

With an instrumental to make noise
Yo, I rock the home girls too
I'll explain the name of the crew, hah

This beat is, this beat is
