"Well I guess there's nothing for us to worry about,
 We're the ones who've got control."
Look at all the fools
With their eyes sticking out
Backup, backup.
?
?
Backup, backup.
Deceived by the hype
They all want control
Backup, backup.
No tomorrow,
There's no life today
Backup, backup.
Decayed by the plague
Erosion starts
Backup, backup.
They find all their problems
Revenge is sweet
Backup, backup.

We'll steal your dreams,
Control your minds
Persecute the fools,
Left behind
The realm of the freaks,
Is to solve the demise
We'll ravage the poor,
Blinded by lies
Avoid all the victims
Who pray for power
Backup, backup.
The slaughter starts now,
Without a warning
Backup, backup.
The realm of the freaks,
Is to solve the demise
Backup, backup.
Backup, backup
Hold, hold their faith
Avoid all the victims
Who pray for power
Backup, backup.
"It is not safe to hope for the best, without preparing for the worst"
"Our image is not tarnished, we need not to become militaristic"

Sooner or later
We all pay the price
Backup, backup.
The shame and the pain of the mordant view
Backup, backup.
Corrosive devotion
The slate is cleansed
Backup, backup.
We'll steal your dreams,
Control your minds
Persecute the fools,
Left behind

The realm of the freaks,
Is to solve the demise
Ravage the lifeless,
Blinded by lies

Sooner or later
We all pay the price
We'll steal your dreams,
Control your minds
Persecute the fools,
Left behind.
