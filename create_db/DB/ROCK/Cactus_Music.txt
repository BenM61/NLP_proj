Get your 45's together and put a record on the deck 
Well it's time to raise the
Roof off here get ready and get set
Let's all sing this song together 
Everyone in time 
Forget your aggravation let it go it's cactus time

Raise your hands up to the music rock, rock 
Getting' down with
Cactus music never wanna stop

Gonna feel that funky backbeat grease it up
With bass guitar once jimmy starts the
Riffin' you can?t sit down no more this is the
Time of our lives takin' everything in sight 
 cause this is cactus music 
Baby you are ours tonight

Raise your hands up to the music rock, rock 
Getting' down with cactus music 
Never want to stop
Just let it go and lose it this is cactus music 
Rock'n'roll music rock, rock, rock

We supply the feeling you supply the need 
Come on and get movin' feel the beat 
We are built for comfort we are built for speed 
Now everybody boogie 
Let's go, let's go
