I know it's kinda hard, 
To get over someone, 
And try to start aknew, 
A new relationship... 
No need to rush 'cause you've, 
Got all the time in the world, 
Right now let's focus on, 
How we can keep you happy... 
I can feel it when you hurt. 
You will never be alone. 
All those crying days are gone. 
I'll be here to guide you. 
Baby i will be right there and you know i'll always care baby... 
-Chorus- 
You can call on me whenever you need someone, i'll be there 
Put your trust in me whenever girl you need someone, i'll be right

I know he broke your heart, 
Your love is truly over. 
He left you sad and lonely, 
Now you're feeling empty. 
He's got to realize, 
He made a big mistake, 
Leaving you was the worst, 
thing he could ever do... 
I can feel it when you hurt 
Girl you'll never be alone 
All those crying days are gone

Baby i will be right there and you know i'll always care... 
-Chorus- 
You can call on me whenever you need someone, i'll be there 
Put you trust in me, whenever girl you need someone i'll be right 
there.
