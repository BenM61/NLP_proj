I've heard about a great big swindle
I read about it in a book
The book flew out the window
Was later found by thieves and crooks

And now
they're singing hallelujah
I'm wondering just what did they find
They say "what's it to ya?"
Just take a place in line

And wait
So I wait
I wait
And wait
And I

I'm one of a few survivors
I'm a drawer labelled "lost and found"
Moon travelers and deep sea divers
Whose oxygen supply ran out
Now maybe if their gods be willing
They'll give us something, fill our empty cups
Sit down in the boat, don't spill it
Or we'll just have to line back up

And wait
So we wait
We wait
Yes we wait
And we wait
And we wait
We will wait
'Til we

You can hear it in the beat they march to
And you can feel the earth shake when they start to dance
You can tell by the way they move you
It's not murder, it's an act of faith, baby

And as the world moves faster
Whip lashing us round and round
It's quite a slow disaster
But people keep on falling down

As they wait
We wait
And we wait
We wait
Hallelujah!
