It was strange glue that held us together
While we both came apart at the seams
She said your place or mine while we've still got the time
So I played along with her schemes
But I don't have the right to be with you tonight
So please leave me alone with no saviour in sight
I will sleep safe and sound with nobody around me

When faced with my demons, I clothe them and feed them
And I smile, yes I smile as they're taking me over
And if I can not sleep for the secrets I keep
It's the price I'm willing to meet
The end of the night never comes too quickly for me

But I don't have the right to be with you tonight
So please leave me alone with no saviour
I will sleep safe and sound with nobody around me

When faced with my demons
I clothe them and feed them
And I'll smile, yes I'll smile
As they're taking me over

And if I cannot sleep for the secrets I keep
It's the prize I'm willing to steal
Oh the end of the night never comes too quickly for me
And I smile . . .
The end of the night never comes too quickly for me
I smile, smile, I smile as they're taking me over
I smile
The end of the night never comes too quickly for me
Never comes too quickly for me
