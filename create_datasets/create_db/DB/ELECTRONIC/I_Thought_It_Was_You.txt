Don't say your world lights up when I smile
'cause you know it's too late for talk like that
And as this love fades 
We both know that I have been betrayed
I'm not looking for the answer, baby
I'm just looking for a little love
We're all looking for something, baby
And for a minute, a minute, a minute

I thought it was you
I thought it was you
I thought that it was you
I thought it was you

Don't say that you'll be there when I need you
'cause where are you when I need you now
I need you
The truth hurts
Ooh I'm hurting now I'm hurting ooh
I'm not looking for the answer baby
I'm just looking for a little love
We're all looking for someone baby
And for a minute, a minute, a minute

(Repeat chorus)

I wouldn't change a thing except the ending
'Til the part where you broke my heart
Everybody's talking about forgiveness
I can't forgive you for leaving me

I'm not looking for the answer baby
I'm just looking for a little love
We're all looking for something baby
And for a minute, a minute, a minute

(Repeat chorus)
