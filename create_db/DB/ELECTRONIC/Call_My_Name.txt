Can I bring something up
Don't mean to be confrontational
But lately we haven't made time
To be conversational

Don't hear sweet nothing's no more
Like if life has gotten in the way, yeah
How in the world could this have happen to us 
We use to have so much to say

Tell me baby

When was the last time you heard me call you sweet darling, yeah
And when was the last time I heard you say hey baby, hey, (been such a long time)
It's been such long time since you heard me call you sweet darling, (I don't know)
I just can't remember the last time you called my name

Mmmm, I don't know where we went wrong
And I don't won't these days to turn to years, baby (I decided)
So I decided not to live this way
So I'm asking you through my tears (So tell me baby)

When was the last time you heard me call you sweet darling, (I don't remember when)
And when was the last time I heard you say hey baby, (hey baby) hey (hey baby, baby, baby)
It's been such long time since you heard me call you sweet darling 
(And I just can't remember why) 
And I just can't remember the last time you called my name
(I just don't know, hey)

I just can't remember (I just can't remember baby) the last time you called my name (Call me, call my name)

When was the last time I heard you call me sweet darling
And when was the last time I heard you say hey baby, hey (things, things just aren't the same) 
It's been such long time since you heard me call you sweet darling. ( all you gotta do, all you gotta say 
And I just can't remember the last time you called my name
