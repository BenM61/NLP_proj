I can't take anymore 
I can't breathe 
I'm sick of this goddamn darkness, 
Sick of sadness and tears I throw it all up every single day 
Together with last night's dinner 

I have lost myself completely
I have convinced myself I am someone else

For God's sake, 
I need to be real 
I need touch 
I need people 

I have to turn my life around

But I will still be myself, won't I?
