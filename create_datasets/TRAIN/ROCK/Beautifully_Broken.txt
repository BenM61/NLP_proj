Every tear, every doubt
Every time you've fallen down
When you're hurting, feeling shame
When you're numbing all your pain
When you've lost your way
And feel so far away
You're not

You're beautifully broken
And you can be whole again
Even a million scars
Doesn't change whose you are
You're worthy
Beautifully broken

Every fear of being loved
For who you are no matter what
When you're stumbling, with each step
And you're haunted by regret
And the darkness closes in
Just listen

You're beautifully broken
And you can be whole again
Even a million scars
Doesn't change whose you are
You're worthy
Beautifully broken
You're beautifully broken (beautifully broken)
You're beautifully broken

Oh, the god who made the stars
Is the god that made your heart
And he's holding you right now
He can heal the broken parts
And make beauty from the scars, the scars
Beautiful scars!

You're beautifully broken
And you can be whole again
Even a million scars
Doesn't change whose you are
You're worthy
You're beautifully broken oh oh 
And you can be whole again oh oh yeah
Even a million scars
Doesn't change whose you are
You're worthy
You're beautifully broken (you're beautifully broken)
Beautifully broken (you're beautifully broken)
You're beautifully broken
