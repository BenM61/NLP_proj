Well I know she's a tracker, 
Any scarlet would back her
And they say she's a chooser,

And she's dealt with the goons
Now she drinks from the bitter cup,

And as my mind unweaves, 
I feel the freeze down in my knees 
But just before she leaves, she receives

I get weary holding on
Now I'm coldly fading fast, 
I don't think I'm gonna last

With my eyes in the clock

And here I am again
And as my mind unweaves, 
I feel the freeze down in my knees
But just before she leaves, she receives
