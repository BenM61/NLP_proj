Look at the happy people
Christmas is in the air
Well, I know the secret of Christmas
A secret I'm willing to share (oh, right, yeah, yeah)

It's not the glow you feel when snow appears
It's not the Christmas card you've sent for years
Not the joyful sound when sleigh bells ring (ring, ring, ring)
Or the merry songs children sing

Yeah, the little gift you send on Christmas day
Will not bring back the friend you turned away
So may I suggest the secret of Christmas (the secret of Christmas)
It's not the things you do at Christmas time
But the Christmas things you do all year through?

La la, la la la, la la la, la la la la 
So may I suggest the secret of Christmas (the secret of Christmas)
It's not the things you do at Christmas time
But the Christmas things you do all year?
Look at the happy people (it's not the things you do)
Christmas is in the air (it's not the glow you feel)
Well, I know the secret of Christmas 
A secret I'm willing to share
The secret of Christmas
