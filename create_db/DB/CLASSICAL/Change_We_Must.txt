[Chorus]
Oona-a-aya
Tamara ooha
Shana too aya
Lay mi

Coming through vision
Coming through wisdom
Coming together
This love

Giving me daytime
Giving this nighttime
Bringing within me
This love

[Chorus]

Coming through wisdom
Coming together
This love

[Chorus]

Coming to the earth
Singing to the stars
Change we must
To live again

Coming to the earth to the moon
Coming to the sky to the earth
Change we must
To live again

We will witness this song, we will sing
We belong to the world
"Our Mother so Devine"
We live again
This is here
This is now
This is love
This is life that surrounds

Change we must
To live again

[Chorus]
