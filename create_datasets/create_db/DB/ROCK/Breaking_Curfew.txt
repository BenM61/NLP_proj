Walk out
Through the rain
Where the sound of your own footsteps
Speak a change

When we take our refuge
In our higher place
But somewhere no one knows
We'll meet it face to face

Breaking (Breaking) 
The curfew
Walking (Walking) 
Where we want to
Dodging (Dodging) 
The big lights upon the wall
Stand tall

Stand up
Don't slip away
Thought they had you tied and beaten
Not today

When someone tries to tell you
That I was never here
Or our love is obselete
Turn away, stand clear

Breaking (Breaking) 
The curfew
Walking (Walking) 
Where we want to
Dodging (Dodging) 
The big lights upon the wall
Stand tall

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

Look out
Don't walk away
You could have been that finest hour
Break the chains

We're the ones who feed
The winds that blow again
The screams behind the barricade
Stop the bloody rain

Breaking (Breaking) 
The curfew
Walking (Walking) 
Where we want to
Dodging (Dodging) 
The big lights upon the wall

Breaking (Breaking) 
The curfew
Walking (Walking) 
Where we want to
Dodging (Dodging) 
The big lights upon the wall
Stand tall
