No man should have face to face 
His problems alone, alone, alone 
Reach out and help the weak man 
Make him strong, strong, strong 
Now I want to help somebody 
I'd like to help you, you, you 
Now don't that make you want to 
Help somebody too, too, too 

*The love you give 
Might help somebody live 
So give yourself 
Go out and help somebody else 
Your helping hand 
Will make you a better man 
Do wah, do way, let love prevail 
Reach out and help somebody 
Reach out and help somebody 

If we all stand together 
We'll all stand tall, tall, tall 
We wouldn't let each other 
Tumble and fall, fall, fall 
Now let's reach down together 
And lift somebody up, up, up 
Give a little love and kindness 
It won't take much, much, much 

The love you give 
Might help somebody live 
So give yourself 
Go out and help somebody else 
Your helping hand 
Will make you a better man 
Do wah, do way, let love prevail 
Reach out and help somebody 
Reach out and help somebody 

Reach out your hand and help somebody today
