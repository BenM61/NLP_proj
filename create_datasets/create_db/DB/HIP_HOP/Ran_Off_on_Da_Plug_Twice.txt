F*ck a shooter I'm my own shooter
All this ice I'm my own jeweler
Six lawyers and they all Jewish
I'm the star bitch this is my movie
Pinky ring two-fifty on it
Guess it's safe to say nigga I spent your budget on it
Ran off on the plug twice
He steady callin', I ain't callin' back
He said he dissed me on his last album
Guess nobody heard it 'cause nobody bought his last album
I got a Delta go to Howard
That little pussy got some power
Born broke but I'm gonna die rich
Lot of these f*ck niggas counterfeit

I'm just vibin' in the Ritz Carlton
Got the stick, call the Ritz Carlton
Count a mil ridin' Ritz Carlton
Wanna f*ck me baby pull up at the Ritz Carlton

I'm just vibin' in the Ritz Carlton
Got the stick, call the Ritz Carlton
Count a mil ridin' Ritz Carlton
Wanna f*ck me baby pull up at the Ritz Carlton

Everything on me brand new
Call her a mangler 'cause she ran through
Said she want me to take the rubber off
Told her people in Hell want ice water, bitch knock it off
All the cribs came with elevators
Oldschools painted same colors as now and laters
Said if you ain't got haters you ain't poppin' nigga
I don't rap beef let's shoot it out
That's how I'm rockin nigga
Trap money made six figures
If you're thuggin' out you better keep a rocket with you
In front of Neiman's in a black Jag
Told her if the head bad swear I'll buy her a new ass
I spend money for the f*ck of it
I stay flushin' for the rush of it
I want to have me about 10 kids
Give 'em a mill a piece and tell 'em now do what your daddy did

I'm just vibin' in the Ritz Carlton
Got the stick, call the Ritz Carlton
Count a mil ridin' Ritz Carlton
Wanna f*ck me baby pull up at the Ritz Carlton

I'm just vibin' in the Ritz Carlton
Got the stick, call the Ritz Carlton
Count a mil ridin' Ritz Carlton
Wanna f*ck me baby pull up at the Ritz Carlton
