Take your time
I can wait
It's been around us all before,
But nothing has changed

Well I know
What you do
And I know what's funny now,
Will bother me soon

If there was a better life,
I know you'd be shying away
The dream of a better life,
I know that you shied away

Oh, come on

It's a pose
It's a beat
It goes round and round my head
Stuck on the beat

Take your time
I can wait
We'll go round and round this all,
Again and again

If there was a better life,
I know you'd be shying away
The dream of a better life,
I know that you shied away

We're on a knife edge
On a knife edge of a time
And it's you, tearing me apart

Keep me on a knife edge
On a knife, edge of a time
It's you, tearing me apart

We're on a knife edge
On a knife edge of a time
And it's you, tearing me apart

Keep me on a knife edge
On a knife, edge of a time
And it's you, tearing me apart

Around and around and around again
