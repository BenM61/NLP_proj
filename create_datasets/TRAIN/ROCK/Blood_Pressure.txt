Why can't you, be more like your older brother
Why can't you, ooh (blood pressure)
Why can't you, do a little more for Jesus
Why can't you, (blood pressure) ooh
Ah ah

Blood pressure
Do better
Keep rising
Blood pressure

You're on the road, on a road that's bound for nowhere
Why don't you do what you're told? Blood pressure

Don't worry I will help you out on one condition
Be more, do more, check your blood pressure

Ah ah

Blood pressure
Do better
Keep rising
Blood pressure

Ah ah
Oh

Blood pressure
Do better
Keep rising
Blood pressure

Blood pressure
Won't matter
Keep rising
Blood pressure

Blood pressure
