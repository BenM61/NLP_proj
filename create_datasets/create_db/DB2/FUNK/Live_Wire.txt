It's my birthday, and he forgot again 
Every time we date, he's always late 
All the abuses and excuses, I've made up my mind 
Gonna tell him this time we're through 
But everything I plan to say 
Just seems to fade away 
Every time I see his face 
My eyes light up, sparks start to flyin' 
Like a live wire, real live wire 
Just like a bolt of lightnin', it sets my soul on fire 

Sweet kisses are his alibi 
And that's why, that's where my weakness lies 
Though I plan and rehearse the things I want to say 
The words never never come my way, 'cause
'Cause everything I plan to say 
Just seems to fade away 
Every time I see his face 
My eyes light up, sparks start to flyin' 
Like a live wire 

Like a bolt of lightnin', it sets my soul on fire 
Just like a live wire, real live wire 
A bolt of lightnin', oh yeah, sets my soul on fire 
Like a live wire, real live wire
