Somewhere from another time
Asiatic death
Yellow fever bodies writhe
Sugar on my breath

Is this the final curtain
I don't believe what's happening
She hides behind a veil of tears
Plays upon my darkest fears yea

She's malaria
She's malaria
Swamp fever
Water black as mud

Strength fading
Demon hold
Hungry 4 my blood
So desperately I cling 2 life

Pain I know I must survive
Entity
I see the eyes I can't forget
Caught between this world and the next

Misery
She's malaria
She's malaria
She's malaria
