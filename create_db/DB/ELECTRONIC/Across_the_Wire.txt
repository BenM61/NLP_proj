Well it was a mazy run but for now just close your eyes love
Spend all your life in the sun and now you look for somewhere shaded

Whatever brings you around
Don't ever lay down
Under the great skies
Don't ever lay down
Under the great skies
So long, so long 

Across the wire it comes but it's nobody that you know
Skipping along to somewhere to only let them punch out your lights again

Whatever brings you around
Don't ever lay down
Under the great skies
Don't ever lay down
Under the great skies
