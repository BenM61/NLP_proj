(Verse 1)
Look all around
You see the same thing
In every book, every magazine
All of them saying we're worlds apart
Well, maybe we're different but we share the same heart

(Hook 1)
Ask any woman and she'll tell you what's true
What we need ain't nothing new

The heart of a woman
Is just like a man's
She wants someone who needs her
Someone who understands
The heart of a woman needs like his
Somebody who loves her just like she is
It's as simple as this

(Verse 1)
Look all around
It's all the same
So many people so tired of the game
So disappointed with love that's gone wrong
If only we realized the truth all along

(Hook 2)
Ask anybody and they'll tell you what's true
What they need is the same thing as you

The heart of a woman
Is just like a man's
She wants someone who needs her
Someone who understands
The heart of a woman needs like his
Somebody who loves her just like she is
It's as simple as this

(Hook 3)
It's been the same thing through all of history
But the heart of a woman is no mystery

The heart of a woman
Is just like a man's
She wants someone who needs her
Someone who understands
The heart of a woman needs like his
Somebody who loves her just like she is
It's as simple as this
