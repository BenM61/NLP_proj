Farewell, goodbye, God knows we tried
Our union so unsure could never endure

Slowly turn the page and say goodbye and walk away from everything
That we worked so hard to save

Brought down by our storm
Our return is no more

But we were so lost in love
That we never found resolve

Slowly turn the page and say goodbye and walk away form everything
That we worked so hard to save

I don't want to start all over and find another shoulder to lean on
Cause yours makes me feels safe

And now you're holding on
You're such a blessing and please stay strong
For what it's worth, I'm wishing you the best

Slowly turn the page and say goodbye and walk away from everything
That we worked so hard to save

I don't want to start all over and find another shoulder to lean on
Cause yours makes me feel safe

Yours makes me feel safe
Cause yours makes me feels safe
I'm wishing you the best
