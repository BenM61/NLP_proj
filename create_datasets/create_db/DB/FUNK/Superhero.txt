One look in your eye
Though I'm stronger than a locomotive
I can't tell a lie
Now that you've become my very life
Enough is enough
No more disguise

I'm yours
Baby you're mine
I'm your superhero
For you I will fight
I'll save your life
I'm your superhero
All day 
All night

Kal-el
Son of Jor-el
All my secrets
You can never tell
And you know why
Especially about the kryptonite
And by the way
I can fly

I'm yours
Baby you're mine
I'm your superhero
For you I will fight
I'll save your life
I'm your superhero
All day 
All night

I can't see through lead
But I am faster than a speeding bullet
You are all I need to make it
Thought his lonely
Daily planet

I'm yours
Baby you're mine
I'm your superhero
For you I will fight
I'll save your life
I'm your superhero
All day 
All night
