I have a book and all these pictures that we took
From a trip to France last September
They help me to remember
Wanna know how you get this feeling
Thinking of the verbal beating
I got from you when I told you I don't want this

So why am I still sitting here crying
Thinking back to when we were flying
A balloon over Paris, and I kinda miss you

If I flew
Even though you were holding hands
I forget your name before we land
If I flew
Love it comes and lifes unfold
We'll figure it out when we grow old

Lie to my friends, I broke up with my boyfriend
And they all want to protect me
Thinking I can't go on without you
Can't seem to stop this feeling
Thinking of the verbal beating
I wanna give to you
When you tell me I seem lonely

So why am I still sitting here crying
Thinking back to when we were flying
A balloon over Paris and I kinda miss you

If I flew
Even though we were holding hands
I forget your name before we land
If I flew
Love it comes and lifes unfold
We'll figure it out when we grow old

Lovers are faded to climb these stairs
No complaining, nothing is unfair

Love it comes and lives unfold
We'll figure it out when we grow old
Hmm, oh oh
