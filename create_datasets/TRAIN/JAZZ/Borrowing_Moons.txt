Now that you have found her 
Just put your arms around her 
Talk then of love and that soon 
You'll reach out and give her the moon

We move from cold to colder 
So draw her near and hold her 
Weave moonlight into her hair 
Whisper you'll always be there

Stroke away her sadness 
With a touch of moonlight madness 
A moon can be borrowed at will 
Yet come tomorrow it's still

There on high sailing by 
You and I  

Get wise and not just older 
Draw her near and hold her
