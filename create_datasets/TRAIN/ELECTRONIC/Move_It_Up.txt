Baby, I need you here with me 
Because I've tried to make you understand 
I want you, each move you make 
I realize you are the right one for me 

Move it up, come baby, move it up 
Come baby move it up 
Come baby move this rhythm 
Move it up, come baby, move it up 
Come baby move it up 
Come baby move this rhythm 

Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, gonna move it up, gonna move it up 
Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, gonna move it up, gonna move it up 
Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, gonna move it up, gonna move it up 

Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha... 
Take the chance, now step this way 
Make the move, now seize the day 
For what you had is what you miss 
Hand in hand, you know you wish 

That's the way I feel 
The way I'm gonna be 
That's the way I feel 
That's the way I feel 
The way I'm gonna be 
That's the way I feel 

Move it on up, move it on up, move it up 
Move it on up, move it on up, move it up 
Move it to the rhythm - move it up 
Move it to the rhythm
