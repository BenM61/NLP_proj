Ah
Handle your business 
Can't get your grip 
Can I get a witness?! 
Ghetto people  your dreams have now been fulfilled 
Grip your steel

Ghetto people  your dreams have now been fulfilled

What the rawdog feelin? 
An author like, Terry McMillan 
The cat that, maniac 
My fam dark as death in less than a minute 
(The world stop spinnin') 
The rapid firing squad
Keep on mix fire and (hard to kill) 
Loud wires and bombs, firing arms 
Look, we all for it 
Its the dutch burning herbalice 
Gallon drinkin' alcoholics 
Walk through your toughest pack of goons with my chain out 
Kept it real ever since the first jam came out 
First family turned this whole rap game out 
Sheisty individuals, tryin' to wipe my name out 
But they don't f*ck around cause they know I back that thing out 
And try to mark em off when the gun shots ring out 
And in the myst of black, kid I'ma try to wipe they name out 
And keep on dubbin till I break a fucking spring out

You motherfuckas better raise up (they already did) 
Who that? The '87 stick up kids (we're back!) 
I'm hopin that your focused on the side 
'Cause frontin' on me and my, mad niggaz die 
Is this hiphop? Hell no, this is war 
I've been trying to tell you that since ? rocked some hardcore 
You don't listen. See, gee 
I'm on a mission. Look, be 
They gonna find your ass missing 
Ever since me and Fame came, we maintained 
A strange, but a strong game 
(That can't change!) 
The real ghetto bad shit for blastin, subtractin 
Those that ain't matchin my fashion I'm mashin 
(Retality's real) Fatality's ill 
When your stash in my path then your stash is a raw deal 
(Clap, clap) Get your gat 
(Buckabuckabubububububububuckabucka) blow, blow, get the f*ck back

Face mine 'cause I'm here 
Dog its' all clear 
Rap jewels put it on my baseline from a snare 
Then the want to doubt The Kid 
Who analyze this whole fucking shit? 
Trying to make somethin' out of it 
Explode quicker than landmines 
M.O.P. tapes make earthquakes and cause landslides 
Bump this in your Lex coupe 
Or your Lex hoop 
Danze, finish em, twenty-one gun salute 
(The Crew) 

How many niggas runnin with me? (this few) 
A hundred niggaz gunnin with me (to shoot) 
Firing Squad, draw blood on the enemy 
At point-blank range, deliverin the penalty 
Ain't nothin' but the thugs 
Slangin out hollow slugs 
(Nigga), anti-love keepin it real (Thug, let em slide today) 
I'm known best for leavin em stretchin like Doc Holliday 
Salute!
