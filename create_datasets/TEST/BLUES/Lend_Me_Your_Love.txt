Now lend me your love, little girl, please lend me your love 
Lend me your love, baby, please lend me your love 
I know you hear me keep moanin', moanin' just like Noah's dove 
You got a mortgage on my love, girl, there really is no doubt 
You got a mortgage on my love, girl, there really is no doggone doubt 
But someday I be lucky enough to find another woman, 
Gonna buy your love mortgage out
