Show my dear friends
It's to put your hands
I ought to start this here
Rain for a day glow
But when you wants to boy so
And I wake up in the USA

Oh you know we're gonna ride
On a blue highway
Walk with the legs you're blind
On a blue highway
Wave hellow to pride
On my highway
Yes I almost died
On a blue highway

Oh some sweet mask
Or it's kind of a bitter risk
Out to ride the night
Oh sister's so hip too
I hear you and I miss you
Co-starring in the USA

Oh you know we're gonna ride
On a blue highway
Walk with the legs you're blind
On a blue highway
Wave hellow to pride
On my highway
Yes I almost died
On a blue highway

Why do I miss you
Why did I kiss you
Because

Oh you know we're gonna ride
On a blue highway
Walk with the legs you're blind
On a blue highway
Wave hellow to pride
On my highway
Yes I almost died

So glad that you're living now
I'm glad that you're here
I'm glad that you want to stay
Because

You know we're gonna ride
On a blue highway
Walk with the legs you're blind
On a blue highway
Wave hellow to pride
On my highway
Yes I almost died
On a blue highway
On a blue highway

Wings and we'll wind the love
Yes there's a time a time for love
Then you kissed me
On a blue highway

Why do I miss you
Why did I kiss you
