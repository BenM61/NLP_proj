Oh why, oh why do they teach us Shakespeare
When you're only 16, with no idea, what it all means
Oh Romeo, oh Romeo he thinks it's a love thing
All masks and kisses from the balcony
It's deeper than that bro, it's a fuckin' tragedy

Oh you, taught me so much about you
Taught me so much about love
And yet I learn nothing
And yet I learn nothing
And yet I learn nothing

And yet I learn nothing

All night, all night I sat through the movie
And the plot was so thin, and they kissed at the end, and I squeezed your hand
Oh Romeo, oh Romeo spent hours in the bathroom, 
checking every hair and working on his master plan
Working on his moves, and keeping his cool man

Oh you, taught me so much about you
Taught me so much about love
And yet I learn nothing
And yet I learn nothing
And yet I learn nothing

And yet I Learn Nothing
And yet I Learn Nothing

Turn the pages
Turn the pages
Turn the pages
Oh Romeo, oh Romeo he gets so excited
To get to the end
Well turn the pages my friend
And learn nothing
And learn nothing
And learn nothing
And learn nothing
And learn nothing
