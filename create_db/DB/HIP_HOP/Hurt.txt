Ba ba baa baa ba ba baa
You was a nigga finally make me kill one of y'all
Ain't a damn thing change
I still keep that thing
Right up under my shirt
Better tell them I ain't playin'
Because it's all fun and games
Until somebody get hurt

Ain't a damn thing change
I still keep that thing
Right up under my shirt
When I pull away hang and bang
'Cause it all fun and games
Until somebody get hurt

[Chorus]
You finally get hurt murked put 'em in the dirt
Boy you better catch me first
So you finally get hurt murked put 'em in the dirt
Boy you better catch me first
So you finally get hurt murked put 'em in the dirt
Boy you better catch me first
So you finally get hurt murked put 'em in the dirt
Boy you better catch me first

(I hope they ready)

A lot of pussy nigga talk like bro
Little runnin' they mouth
That is till run in they house
Put the gun in they mouth
Tell 'em nigga talk shit now
They think you know they gonna go baw
I ain't scared of the law
Now bout to go to war
What it is nigga win lose or draw
I never get caught murkin' y'all
'Cause it ain't watcha do
The question is who saw
When I'm way to raw
'Catch me any day you want
You can think I'm a play if you want
But the facts that remain
If I got an AK and you don't
Well then playa you gone
Don't get me wrong
Pussy niggas wanna kill me too (where they at)
But this ain't 'bout shit
'Cause its very well known where I'm at
They can catch me in the booth right now
If it really like that
Naw nigga looking hoe gear in the whole shit
The fo fo's is big and all that ol' shit
Protect the heart of you, both it
You better check ya gun cause you so sick
If the chopper leave you with no dick
Buck blast and there holdin your shit
At least 6 of you and a couple more of you bitches
And I don't miss cause I'm focused

Ain't a damn thing change
I still keep that thing
Right up under my shirt
When I pull away hang and bang
'Cause it all fun and games
Until somebody get hurt

Ain't a damn thing change
I still keep that thing
Right up under my shirt
When I pull away hang and bang
'Cause it all fun and games
Until somebody get hurt

[Chorus]

Boy you might talk loud act real
But they don't really want this here
Pussy niggas better act right lay low
We know where yo family live
Trust me you don't want me up in yo grill
Wit a ski mask on duct taping your kids
You can pray all you want
But I don't forgive
You should have been doin' nothing
But what you do with your dick
I ain't gotta spell it out pimpin you know what it is
The rest gangsta on the real man you know what it is
Plus I got a hundred goons wit me
Dressed in black
Fifty at the front door, fifty at the back
Half got gauges, half got mags
Bring 'em out bring 'em out
Show 'em where they at
We can do them right here
We can catch them in a trap

Run up on this nigga
Put a hole in his hat
Put his brains on the dash in the stalks
He has some dumb fifty more with him
Tell them to hold that
Lights out no hasta manana hasta la vista sara nara y tu
No tomorrow no remorse no sorrow
And the next one of y'all niggas try me like that
I swear to God man
I'm really gonna snap

Ain't a damn thing change
I still keep that thing
Right up under my shirt
When I pull away hang and bang
'Cause it all fun and games
Until somebody get hurt

Ain't a damn thing change
I still keep that thing
Right up under my shirt
When I pull away hang and bang
'Cause it all fun and games
Until somebody get hurt

[Chorus]

Way now over there
I'm a now how to make a nigga beg please
When a bullet goes by
Probably feel a little breeze
Drop to yo knees
I can see the big barrel of the chrome flip
Double grip ain't no where to squeeze
I keep a couple lit off for the niggas who talk shit
When I go to Jacob and I cop that brain
If he tried to see me
I'm a cop that thing
And I'm pop that thing
And the shots gonna stay
The nigga bout to set the trunk wit me
For the most part nigga your stuck with me
I'd tell you something if you was really smart
And you knew better
People probably tell ya
Don't f*ck with me
Front if you want mothafucker
You can catch it
The smile on my face
Even if I got a ratchet
Aah Pop off police pull me over
Believe I got a compartment
And now gotta stash it
Must I just remind ya niggas
When I come through
Know that I am a fine ya niggas
Take two break through
Bust so many shots
Come now I'll probably blind y'all niggas
Now okay
Lets go see you don't really want to feel a mobs search blow
Clap up a nigga then I cap up a nigga
When I finish this shit we'll turn it into an obsearch yo
Look, Listen, then you better observe yo,
Listen to the sizzle from the bullet that the glock burst fro (sss)
Should a probably tweaked you up just a little
And had your body leanin, lookin' like a quarter past four
Stay down better, (stay down) checkin' for a nigga who can put yo body in the dirt (ooh)
I don't play bitch
If you really need to go the other way
You know I got it under way, Sir.

Ain't a damn thing change
I still keep that thing
Right up under my shirt
When I pull away hang and bang
'Cause it all fun and games
Until somebody get hurt

Ain't a damn thing change
I still keep that thing
Right up under my shirt
When I pull away hang and bang
'Cause it all fun and games
Until somebody get hurt

[Chorus]
