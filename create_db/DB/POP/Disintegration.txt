You and me
Hold our breath and count to three
I want so much
To give you my everything

Disintegration
Suffocation
My life is taken
Annihilation

Save my love for you
I'm saving my love for you
I save my love for you
I'm saving my love for you

There's a beating inside of me
Open up we can take it slowly
Let's dissolve our humanity
You found the beat of my heart my heart beat

Oh so free
Give in to you endlessly
Live for your touch
Never have I died so much

Disintegration
Suffocation
My life is taken
Annihilation
