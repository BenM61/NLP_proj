Once there was a girl,
Oh, what a girl,
Said to me, where can it be,
Where's your Cadillac car,
Cadillac car, Cadillac car, 
Where can I get me a Cadillac car
I don't have it now but I can git it, (git it)
I don't have it now but I can git it, (git it)
I don't have it now but I can git it,
Or I'll do the best I can, well, say,
Git it, git it, git it, git it, git it

Once there was a girl,
Oh, what a girl,
Said to me, where can it be,
Where's your diamond ring,
Diamond ring, diamond ring, 
Where can I get me a diamond ring
I don't have it now but I can git it, (git it)
I don't have it now but I can git it, (git it)
I don't have it now but I can git it,
Or I'll do the best I can, well, say,
Git it, git it, git it, git it, git it
