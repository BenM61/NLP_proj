I am the hunter, I am the great unknown
Only my love can conquer
I am the, I am the hunter (I am the hunter)
I am the hunter, into the wild, we go
Give up your heart, surrender
'Cause I am the, I am the hunter (I am the, hey!)

We've been on this road
To a place that, one day, we'll know
Adventure to the other side (I am the, I am the)
Searching high and low for the treasure deep in your soul
The fortune teller's always right

Got them red eyes in the night
Like a panther, outta sight
Gonna sing my battle cry
'Cause I am the, I am the, I am the

I am the hunter, I am the great unknown
Only my love can conquer
I am the, I am the hunter (I am the hunter)
I am the hunter, into the wild, we go
Give up your heart, surrender
'Cause I am the, I am the hunter (I am the, hey!)

I am the
I am the, I am the
I am the
I am the, I am the, I am the, I am the

Strangers wild and free
Through the flames, you're all that I see
A force you, that you can't deny (I am the, I am the)
Hear my calling
Lock and load, come running to me
Dancing through the midnight (I am the, I am the)

Got them red eyes in the night
Like a panther, outta sight
Gonna sing my battle cry
'Cause I am the, I am the, I am the

I am the hunter, I am the great unknown
Only my love can conquer
I am the, I am the hunter (I am the hunter)
I am the hunter, into the wild, we go
Give up your heart, surrender
'Cause I am the, I am the hunter (I am the, hey)

I am the
I am the, I am the
I am the

I am the, I am the, I am the
I am the, I am the, I am the, I am the hunt
I am the, I am the, I am the
I am-I am, I am-I am, I am-I am
Hunter
