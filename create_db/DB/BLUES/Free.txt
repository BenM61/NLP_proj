Everybody come together
Free
Everybody get together
Free
It's okay if you can stand to let her dance
It's okay it's your right, come on and take a chance
True romance, when you dance
Free
Don't be in love with the autograph.
Just be in love when you scream that song on and on
Free

Everybody come together
Free
Everybody get together
Free

You can feel her from the palm that you're holding on your arm
Cool hands from the get-go
Can your feast on the real one?
Don't be in love with the autograph
Just be in love when you love that song on and on
Free

It's okay if you can stand to let him dance
It's okay, it's your right, come on and take a chance.
True romance, when you dance
Free
Everybody come together
Free

Don't fall in love with the autograph
Just fall in love when you sing your song on the?
Take a chance
True romance, when you dance

Free [Repeat: x6]
