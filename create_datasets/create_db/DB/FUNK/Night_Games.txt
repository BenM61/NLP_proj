We've made the best of our love
And we gave our all, but the tears began to fall
It seems we're always too late
When we try to change, rearrange the hands of fate
Two lovers lost and alone
It's so hard to face this love we can't replace
Now I'm searchin' to find someone new, isn't easy
Remember that I could have been here next to you

Lost in the night games
I've been missing you
We've only got ourselves to blame
Now love is through

Lost in the night games
I've been missing you
Lost in the night games
All alone

Forever started today
Now we lost our way and our hearts have gone astray
It never entered my mind
What I wouldn't trade today for the love we left behind

Now love should have been more than goodbye
We were so near, now so far, you and I

Now I'm lost in the night games
I've been missing you
We've only got ourselves to blame
Now love is through

Lost in the night games
I've been missing you
Lost in the night games
All alone

Now I'm searchin' to find someone new, isn't easy
Remember that I could have been here next to you

So I'm lost in the night games
I've been missing you
We've only got ourselves to blame
Now love is through

Lost in the night games
I've been missing you
Lost in the night games
All alone

Oh, I'm lost, lost in the night games, oh, oh
We've only got ourselves, ourselves to blame
'Cause we're lost, lost, we're lost, I'm so lost, yeah
Oh, it's nothin', nothin' but a game
And I'm so lost, I'm lost, I'm-I'm lost
We
