Baby hair with a woman's eyes
I can feel you watching in the night
All alone with me, and we're waiting for the sunlight

When I feel cold you warm me
And when I feel like I can't go on you come and hold me
It's you and me forever

Sara smile (smile)
Why don't you smile awhile for me
Sara

If you feel like leaving you know you can go
But why don't you stay until tomorrow
If you want to be free, you know
All you got to do is say so

When you feel cold I warm you
And when you feel you can't go on I'll come and hold you
It's you and me forever

Sara smile (smile)
Why don't you smile awhile for me
Sara
