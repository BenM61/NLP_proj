I've got you under my skin
I feel you coursing through my veins
I don't know where to begin
To talk about somethin'
That's never gonna change
Don't have to tell my body to breathe
And I don't know how to tell you how much I believe that

You're a part of every heartbeat that keeps me alive
You're the best of the best of every dream in my life
I'll need you with me
Permanently

We ride this river of time
So many people drift away
But once in forever we find
A rock of all ages and a love that remains
And for me you are that one
My never-ending story has begun

You're a part of every heartbeat that keeps me alive
You're the best of the best of every dream in my life
I'll need you with me
Permanently

You're a part of every heartbeat that keeps me alive
You're the best of the best of every dream in my life
I'll need you with me
Permanently
