I guess I just got lost
Being someone else.
I tried to kill the pain,
But nothing ever helped.
I left myself behind,
Somewhere along the way
Hoping to come back around
To find myself someday

Lately I'm so tired of waiting for you
To say that it's OK.

Tell me please
Would you one time just let me be myself
So I can shine
With my own light.
Let me be myself.

Would you let me be myself?

I'll never find my heart
Behind someone else.
I'll never see the light of day
Living in this cell.
It's time to make my way
Into the world I knew.
And then take back all of these times
That I gave in to you

Lately I'm so tired of waiting for you
To say that it's OK.

Tell me please
Would you one time just let me be myself
So I can shine
With my own light.
Let me be myself.

For a while,
If you don't mind,
Let me be myself
So I can shine
With my own light.
Let me be myself.

That's all I've wanted from this world,
Is to let me be me.

Tell me please
Would you one time just let me be myself
So I can shine
With my own light.
Let me be myself.

Tell me please
Would you one time just let me be myself
So I can shine
With my own light.
Let me be myself.

Tell me please
Would you one time just let me be myself
So I can shine
With my own light.
Let me be myself.

Would you one time
Oh, let me be myself
And let me be me.
