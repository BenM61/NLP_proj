(Come and walk with me)
(We can go where peaceful waters flow)

If loneliness surrounds you
And rain clouds always hang around you
And wakin' up each day gets you down
(Gets you down, gets you down)

And if the life that you're leading
Seems hollow then maybe
What you're needing
Is someone to turn your world around?

Take my hand and walk with me
Let me teach you how to smile
And I'll show you skies where gentle breezes blow
And I'll take you where peaceful waters flow
(Peaceful waters flow)

If you let me, I'll take you
Where peaceful waters flow
(Come and walk with me)
(We can go where peaceful waters flow)

Now if the sunshine hurts your eyes, boy
Then it's time for you to realize, boy
Beyond this moment there's a better day
(Better day, better day)

And if you let me
I'll guide you, mmm
I'll always be there, right there beside you
Reaching every step of your way

Come take my hand and walk with me awhile
Let me teach you how to smile
And I'll show you skies, where gentle breezes blow
And I'll take you where peaceful waters flow
(Peaceful waters flow)

Hey, hey, if you trust me
I'll take you there where peaceful waters flow
(Come and walk with me)
(We can go) where peaceful waters flow
