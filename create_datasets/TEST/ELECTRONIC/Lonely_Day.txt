Hold me
You said
Hold me closer to your heart
Lonely

So lonely
It seems we fall apart
Don't let it fall apart
On a day

On a lonely day
Like today
I awoke
The sky was grey

We were born dead
I'm waiting for the day
The day we rise again
On a day

On a lonely day
Like today
I awoke
The sky was grey

Deadly pale as you
Slowly slip away
One day we'II rise again
Lovely

My lovely
A glimmer in the dark
Lonely
So lonely

Can't help but break apart
No glue to mend this heart
I always fall
I always fall apart

Don't hold on to me
My love won't set you free
As empty as can be
I wander aimlessly
