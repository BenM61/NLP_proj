Who can bring me back to life?
I can see the way that this could go
Oh, haven't show your face
I heard you're somewhere here with us
I don't know who to believe
But I've been hoping

I can't tell when this would end
You're just wild, and this pass so slow
I just listen to the noise
And the silence in your voice
The sound is in all I hear

You take me higher still
And you'll always will
You take me higher still
You've been healing my heart

You take me higher still
And you'll always will
You take me higher still
You've been healing my heart

Music is the answer to your problems
Keep on moving then you can solve them

Music is the answer to your problems
Keep on moving then you can solve them

Music is the answer to your problems
Keep on moving then you can solve them

Music is the answer to your problems
Keep on moving then you can solve them

Heal my heart, take me higher
Heal my heart, take me higher
Heal my heart, take me higher
Heal my heart, take me higher
Heal my heart, take me higher
Heal my heart, take me higher
Heal my heart, take me higher
Heal my heart, take me higher
Heal my heart, take me higher
Heal my heart, take me higher still

If time is mess for you
Will you find your favorite tune to me?
Been spinning out there at the single threat
I have to hold me up
Now when they came up just can feel the pain is lifting

I can't tell when this would end
You're just wild, and days are passing slow
I just listen to the noise
And the silence in your voice
The sound is in all I hear

You take me higher still
And you'll always will
You take me higher still
You've been healing my heart

You take me higher still
And you'll always will
You take me higher still
You've been healing my heart

Music is the answer to your problems
Keep on moving then you can solve them

Music is the answer to your problems
Keep on moving then you can solve them

Music is the answer to your problems
Keep on moving then you can solve them

Music is the answer to your problems
Keep on moving then you can solve them

Take me higher, heal my heart
Take me higher, heal my heart
Take me higher, heal my heart
Take me higher, heal my heart
Take me higher, heal my heart
Take me higher, heal my heart
Take me higher, heal my heart
Take me higher, heal my heart
Take me higher, heal my heart
