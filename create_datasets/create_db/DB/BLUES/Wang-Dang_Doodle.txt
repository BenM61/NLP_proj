I'm a little red rooster,
Too lazy to crow for day
I'm a little red rooster,
Too lazy to crow for day
Keep everything in the barnyard,
Upset in every way

Dogs begin to bark now,
And the hounds begin to howl
Dogs begin to bark now,
And the hounds begin to howl
Watch out stray cat,
The little red rooster's on the prowl

If you see the little red rooster
Won't you please drive him home
If you see the little red rooster
Won't you please drive him home
Been no peace in the barnyard
Since that little red rooster's been gone

I'm a little red rooster,
Too lazy to crow for day
I'm a little red rooster,
Too lazy to crow for day
Keep everything in the barnyard,
Upset in every way
