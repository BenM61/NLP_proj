I nearly died when you jumped in
But you had to drown before you could swim
All the people on the beach, they were so impressed
That they wanted to join you but no they wouldn't undress
Oh there, that wetness, splashed their skin
So they prayed for a whirlpool to pull you in
Ya ho
Ya ho
Ya ho

So they looked away and they tried to pretend
That it was for you, but no it wasn't for them
Now the fear of sinking remains in place
But it's this fear of failure that a real disgrace

Ya ho
Ya ho
Let me be the one
Let me be the one
Let me be the one
Let me be the one
To get over you wall
To get over you wall

Heads in the sand, sea out of reach
Swept away by the games of the beach
Those people sat and watched your stand
While the wait of their fears pulled them underground
Will anyone learn from the stories that are told
Of the tribe who drown in a grave of gold

Ya ho
Ya ho
Ya ho
Ya ho
Ya ho
Ya ho

I see your heads down
Someone's calling
Put you heads down
Someone's drowning
Look up see what's fit for your eyes
Some escaping on someone drowning

Your head is underground
Your head is underground
Your head is underground
Your head is under the ground
