i want to get to know you bettter
seems like we both belong together
you rock my body like no one dares
full force and lots of care
dance to the rhythm as i watch you move
lots of class as we stomp and grind 
i like that move you got that groove biy
rockin in the streets to this funky beat

funky little beat

2 o clock the party's still going on
and all my friends are ready to go
you turn around
smile at you
that's when you shy down
forget just you want
i been a lady why can't you see what i want you to do to me

you can do it so easy
you and me just rocking with the beat
