Well you know I look like a woman but I
Cut like a buffalo
Stand up like a tower, tall
But I fall
Just like a domino

You can hit me if you want to, hey
Do whatever makes you happy
You should try to take it easy on me
Cause I don't know how to take it

You're a prick with a pin woman,yeah

Wake me up when it's broke
Only if it's broken
You know I treat you like a joke but you
Can't tell when I'm joking

You cut a record on my throat
But the record's not broken
Cut a record on my throat
But the record's not broken

Is that you choking?
Is that you choking?
Is that you choking?
Or are you just joking?

You know I look like a woman but I
Cut it like a buffalo
Wake me up when it's broke
Just like a woman
You cut a record on my throat then you
Break me wide open

Is that you joking with me, yeah
You can do me if you like to
Whatever makes you happy
But don't take it easy on me
All never take it easy

Well you know I look like a woman but I
Cut like a buffalo
Stand up like a tower, tall
But I fall
Just like a domino

You're a prick with a pin woman
Push it into my skin, girl
I'm a prick when I sin and I
Know I can't win

You know I look like a woman and I
Cut like a buffalo
