Pounding heart you shake me
I have never been so close
To an earthquake
Take my word I'm trembling
For I know
What I have felt

Pounding heart believe me
Rain is sweeter than
The spring water fountain
Take my hand and lead me
To a place
For us to melt

Into one another

Think the inconceivable
Desire the untouchable

I've come to understand that bliss
Is quite impossible and if
I'll ever find a way
I'll claim another life

I've come to understand that kiss
Was quite impossible and if
I'll ever find a way
I'll halt the turn of time

Pounding heart awake me
I have never been so far
From the shore
Waves mount up around me
Still I don't want to go back

Loving heart believe me
Your sincerity will
Give me the strength to
Work my way through the sea
Memorize the words you said

Think the inconceivable
Desire the untouchable

I've come to understand that bliss
Is quite impossible and if
I'll ever find a way
I'll claim another life

I've come to understand that kiss
Was quite impossible and if
I'll ever find a way
I'll halt the turn of time
