Cannon... are you unnecessary noise?
Cannon... firing on all of your toys
Cannon... thinks we're the same but we are
Cannon... destiny's towing your car

When fire meets powder
You take your cover, I fly over and
When fire drowns water
It spreads it farther, out of my hands

... asking advice from all the clowns
Cannon... take your frustrations to the ground
Cannon... they wait in the wings for you to fall
Cannon... can't you make dust of them all?

When fire meets powder
You run for cover, I fly under and
When fire drowns water
Don't even bother, out of my hands

In some untimely way, the world asked us to leave
Suddenly we're afraid, no longer can we stay
The thread of life was strung to, each and every one
I knew it all along, your call to arms was wrong

Cannon... are you just unwanted noise?
Loose cannon... remember all those you destroy

When fire meets powder
The strongest cower, half heart, underhand
When fire drowns water
It spreads it farther, out of my hands
