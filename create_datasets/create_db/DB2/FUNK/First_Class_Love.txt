I can give you all you need
A love that's guaranteed on a silver platter
I can fill your hopes and dreams
Of each and every hour
And make your nightmares shatter, well shatter me

First class love for you from me
I'm gonna make you feel it
I'm gonna sign and seal it
Ain't no half steppin from me to you
I'll give you all I've got
And baby that's a lot

I can send you on an endless journey to the moon
And you don't even have to leave your room
I can give you blue skies twelve months out of every year
And make your troubles disappear

First class love for you from me
I'm gonna make you feel it
I'm gonna sign and seal it
Ain't no half steppin from me to you
I'll give you all I've got
And baby that's a lot

I can make you scream and make you crawl and make you plead
Baby baby baby I'll fulfill your need
I can cool you off and heat you up at the same time
Baby baby baby come enjoy the ride

First class love for you from me
I'm gonna make you feel it
I'm gonna sign and seal it
Ain't no half steppin from me to you
I'll give you all I've got
And baby that's a lot

First class love I'm gonna make you feel it, can you feel my love
First class love I'm gonna make you feel, I'll give you all my love

Can you feel the first class love, it's sent from me to you
