So I let the bitch hang out with me right
You know word got around I was fucking this nigga bitch
So the nigga called me, he like "you fuckin my bitch"-
I'm like I'm fuckin her right now

Got ya bitch tip-toein' on my marble floors
Red bottoms only for the centerfolds
Big bodies I got 10 of those
Whippin' work it smelling like they dinner rolls

Told that bitch take your shoes off, look don't even argue
Got your bitch tip-toeing on Italian marble
They on that bad batch, too much pork around it
Shorty ass fat you gotta walk around it
Big body got ten of those
Cars, cribs that's eight hoes
Nine piece that's dinner rolls
Wild freaks, that centrefold
Hundred on my shine
You don't like it fine
Got ya bitch tip-toeing like Gregory Hines
Cashing out with that nina
Ten days you ain't seen her
She ask for it, I beat her
You greedy nigga you eat it
These ? niggas all on my dick
Princess cuts all in my wrist
Hundred rounds all in my hip
200 grand all in my whip

Got ya bitch tip-toein' on my marble floors
Red bottoms only for the centerfolds
Big bodies I got 10 of those
Whippin' work it smelling like they dinner rolls

Wet work, got the kitchen stanking
We call a undercover, a pig in the blanket
Uh, lifestyles of the rich and famous
Shoot you in ya head like Abraham Lincoln
Stuntin' on them bitches like Birdman
Roll the weed in white sheets, Ku Klux Klan
Put it on the scale, watch it do numbers
Playing with them keys like Stevie Wonder
All my hoes pretty, all my niggas brazy
We sell that white, sell that brown, call it rice and gravy
Call me Tunechi Lee or don't call me at all
Man f*ck all you niggas, pause

Got ya bitch tip-toein' on my marble floors
Red bottoms only for the centerfolds
Big bodies I got 10 of those
Whippin' work it smelling like they dinner rolls

2 Chainz, that's your best answer
Cup filled with pink, I'm supporting breast cancer
I might do that walk for the 5k
I get paid every time I leave my driveway
Got yo girl tip-toeing on my marble floors
Sitting by the pool, jumping off the diving board
Getting to the money I'mma need a money counter
So many acres, my neighbours stay in another county
Ted Dibiase in Versace loafers
All you talk is shit nigga halitosis
Ghosts, I pulled up in that pale thang
Got a Chanel chain, on top of Chanel chain, on top of Chanel chain, on top of Chanel chain
Goddamn!

Got ya bitch tip-toein' on my marble floors
Red bottoms only for the centerfolds
Big bodies I got 10 of those
Whippin' work it smelling like they dinner rolls
