Two nights ago I had a dream
The radio was on and the T.V
I was hungry, I couldn't sleep
So I went down to the kitchen to find something to eat
So I opened up the door of my G.E
I didn't have no groceries
So I headed down to the corner store
Cause I had the bills for a few bites more
There were people dancin' in the stret
Moving to the funky beat just groovin'
They were dancin' to the rhythm of the back beat
So I lost my head and followed the crowd
To a doorway where the music was loud
And inside they were dancin' and singin' and 
I heard them shouting

Hey, this is the house of rhythm, welcome everybody 
Yeah, this is the house of rhythm, we come here to party

The girls were fly and the D.J was rough
He was playin' wild and furious
Scratchin', rappin', cuttin' it up
Yo! this homeboy was serious
I'm the love machine, I never lose thwe crowd
Said all you other D.J's just don't know how to do it like Mr. Nice
I'm like Kentucky fried chicken, I di it right
There were people dancin' in the street
Movin' to a funky beat just groovin'
They were dancin' the rhythm of the back beat
Well, I lost my head started to shout
In my p.j I was turnin' it out
And no one stopped to stare
Cause it doesn't even matter what clothes you're wearin'

Hey, this is the house of rhythm, welcome everybody
Hey this is the house of rhythm, we like to party
Live tonight
The house will rock
Live tonight
Live tonight
