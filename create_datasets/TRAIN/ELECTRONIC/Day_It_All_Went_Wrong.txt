i got up, i got upset
the coffee made me angry
so i gave in, went back to bed
waking up aint easy
the day it all went wrong

i fell in love, i fell apart
i fell on my face in the shower
i tried to dance but you broke my heart
and all that within an hour
the day it all went wrong

hey i guess it sounds insane
but it was just one of those days
it was the day it all went wrong
oh yeah, oh yeah

i missed some calls, i walked into walls
i hurt myself on a skateboard
i drank so much wine that i lost my mind
and i fell asleep at a bus stop
the day it all went wrong

hey i guess it sounds insane
but it was just one of those days
it was the day it all went wrong
oh yeah, oh yeah

it was one god damn thing after another 
that all went to hell
it was one of those days where it all went wrong
but what can i say?
what can i do?

hey i guess it sounds insane
but it was just one of those days
it was the day it all went wrong
oh yeah, oh yeah
hey i guess it sounds insane
but it was just one of those days
it was the day it all went wrong
oh yeah, oh yeah
