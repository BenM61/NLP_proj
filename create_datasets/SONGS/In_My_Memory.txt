That summer, we talked endlessly
Always, about everything,
Fusion, nothing new for you
I felt, hey, under and, cool breezes
The heavenly

Face me, sitting in my memory,
Hold me, I remember
Face me, sitting in my memory,
Hold me, I remember

We argue, constantly
Disagree, about everything
Distance, nothing new for me
I feel uneasy, under this thing
Thoughts away
The heavenly

Face me, sitting in my memory,
Hold me, I remember
Face me, sitting in my memory,
Hold me, i remember
I remember

And darkness falls in my eyes
And days are far from rosy now
And if I asked for the sky
Would you still shelter me
When the sky falls

I remember
I remember

Face me, sitting in my memory,
Hold me, I remember
Face me, hidden in my memory,
Hold me, I remember
I remember
Sitting in my memory
I remember
