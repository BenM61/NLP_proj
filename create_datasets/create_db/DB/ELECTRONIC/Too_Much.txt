My head is sore
I'm a tortured man

Am I encased in this devil's plan ?
I'm in pain
I've been rearranged
My conception of love is new.
Why am I running
Runing away from everything that I wanted to do ?

Too much love and I don't want to lose it
- I don't want to lose it -
Don't want to be lonely like before.
All that I want to do is be madly in love with you
You
You

You
You
You
- I don't want to lose it -

You
You
You
You
You
You.

Escape
Escape from this tickertape
God
I'm underground
Oh yeah.
A circle's been drwan
It's lonely dawn

Should I pencil in this emptiness ?
The lesson I've learnt is don't run from it
So go with it !

Too much love and I don't want to lose it
- I don't want to lose it -
Don't want to be lonely like before.
All that I want to do is be madly in love with you
You
You

You
You
You
- I don't want to lose it -

You
You
You
You
You
You.

You
You
You
You
You
You
- I don't want to lose it -

You
You
You
You
You
You.

Too much love and I don't want to lose it
- I don't want to lose it -
Don't want to be lonely like before.
All that I want to do is be madly in love with you
You
You

You
You
You
- I don't want to lose it -

You
You
You
You
You
You.
