Daylight splits the room
You sleep while I watch you
How the light shines on you now
Breathless and playing tricks
But you rise to my fingertips
How the light shines on you now
I'll be the one to set the story straight
I'll be the one to take your hand and say
Now we run, what's done is done
Let time heal time, your hand in mine

Sundance my friend, truth is this city's dead
Its been dying since you left
Don't look for me here, these waters will never clear
Even light dies through the years
I'll be the one to set the story straight
And I'll be the one to take your hand and say
Now we run, what's done is done
And we slip through the wire, fight fire with fire
And we search for a sign, through white noise white lies

Day light leaves the room
You sleep while I watch you
How the light shines on you now
