Walk around, why wear a frown
Say little people, try to put you down 
What you need, is a helpin' hand
All the strength, at your command

How's ya faith? 'Cause ya faith is you
Who you kiddin', to yourself be true
Spread ya love, for a brighter day
For what ya search, you'll find a way

Oh yes sir
Oh yes sir

We are people, of the mighty
Mighty people of the sun
In our heart lies all the answers
To the truth you can't run from

Eagle flies, every seven days
Still cryin the blues, all about ya pay
What ya gonna do? 'Bout your living thang
Will ya make it better, or just complain

Everyday is real, don't run from fear
'Cause better days are very near
There are times when you're bound to cry
One more time, head to the sky

Oh yes sir
Oh yes sir

We are people, of the mighty
Mighty people of the sun
In our heart lies all the answers
To the truth you can't run from

We are people, of the mighty
Mighty people of the sun
In our heart lies all the answers
To the truth you can't run from

We are people, of the mighty
Mighty people of the sun
In our heart lies all the answers
To the truth you can't run from
