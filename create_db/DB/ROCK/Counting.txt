Won't you please step inside?
Something to show, something to share
My knife wants to hide, deep inside of you
I'll announce the grand prize
Arterial spray-paints the carpet
Before your eyes
Better believe it

Take this back
If you really want to
Take this back
I'm counting on you

Want to take you aside
And softly whisper questions at you
As you slowly die, gripping to my shirt
The consolation prize for coming in last
Wishful thinking, cut down to size
Cut up on the floor watching me smile
Take this back
If you really want to
Take this back
I'm counting on you

I'm counting on you [x4]

Won't you please step inside?
Something to show, something to share
My knife still wants to hide
Deep inside of you
I'll announce the grand prize
Arterial spray-painted carpet
Before your eyes
Better fucking believe it

Take this back
If you really want to
Take this back
I'm counting on you

I'm counting on you [x4]
