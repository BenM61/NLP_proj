Comin' down the mountain
One of many children
Everybody has
Their own opinion
Everybody has
Their own opinion
Holding it back
Hurts so bad
Jumping out of my flesh
And I said

Cash in!
Cash in now honey
Cash in now
Cash in now
Cash in now honey
Cash in miss smith
Cash in now!

I was comin down the mountain
Met a child she had pin eyes
We had the same opinion
Had the same opinion
She was holding it back
It hurts do bad
Jumping out of her flesh
And I said

Cash in!
Cash in now honey
Cash in now
Cash in now
Cash in now honey
Cash in miss smith
Cash in now!
