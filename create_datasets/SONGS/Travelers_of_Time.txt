Blind your eyes
The journey is beginning
Hold on tight
We're heading to the past times
Feel how your brain is distorting all you see
And I have been shouthing your name but you just can't hear
Listen to me

I'm your guide
Approaching from the future
Be prepared
To fly above the rainbow
Know that your mind is distorting all you see
Jumping from places in time you have never been
Now come along with me

Riding faster than the speed of light
Flash through the skies
Towards forever
We'll bring a message that can save mankind
Open your minds
'Cause we are the travelers of time

I have been sailing in a dream
You can take me through this door
Eternally
There's so many places we can go
Let's get moving on

We're riding faster than the speed of light
Flash through the skies
The age of forever
We'll bring a message that can save mankind
Open your minds
We are the travelers of time
Flash through the skies
Riding the rainbow's eye
Open your minds
'Cause we are the travelers of time
