It always seems so hard to talk about it
Somethin' about the way you make me feel
Lets me know that I can do without it
Lets me know that love is oh so real

I love the way you love me
I love the way you do
I love the way you love me
And for always, my love, it's forever true

Life is a breeze, the sun is always shinin'
Nothin' is wrong whenever you're around
Whatever I do there's something there remindin'
Of the beautiful friend in you that I found

I'm never alone, you're there when I need you
To keep me from all of the things I feel
I want you to know I could never leave you
It makes me feel good to know that you are near, whoa

I love the way you love me
I love the way you do
(The way you do)
I love the way you love me
(And for always, my love, it's forever true)

I love the way you love me
(Love the way you love me)
I love the way you do
(The way you do, boy)
I love the way you love me
(And for always, and for always my love)

I love the way you love me
I love the way you do
(The way you do)
I love the way you love me
(And for always, my love, oh)

I love the way you love me
I love the way you do
I love the way you love me
