Give me your faith, something I can believe in
And you'll be my family, my brother, my friend 
Tell me a truth that I find not deceiving 
Teach me a lesson that I understand 

Build me a shelter, a place I can dwell in
Show me a future that I can enjoy
Give me a reason and I'll be your fellow
Show me the target I have to destroy

Exterminate annihilate destroy

Show me my leader and I'll pledge obedience
Whisper the name of the enemy mine
Blessed be my fate and my tools of expedience
I'm going to fulfill what's my mission divine

Exterminate annihilate destroy
