I thought I could hear you
Echoing words of denial
Careful not to feel you near me
Clawing out at what you call life
Hold on to what you want, hold on to what you have
Hold on to where you are, hold on to where
I face the change, I've tasted pain, digging a hole, now take the blame
I fell aside, I cast away, covered in shame, now take the blame
Thought I was beneath you
Crawling in your bed of lies
You infected me with envy
Tiny daggers in my eye
Hold on to what you want, hold on to what you have
Hold on to where you are, hold on to where
I face the change, I've tasted pain, digging a hole, now take the blame
I fell aside, I cast away, covered in shame, now take the blame
Thought I could believe you selling me your big surprise
Only needing one more victim, tearing down your one disguise
Hold on to what you want, hold on to what you have
Hold on to where you are, hold on to where
I face the change, I've tasted pain, digging a hole, now take the blame
I fell aside, I cast away, covered in shame, now take the blame
