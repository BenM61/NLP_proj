My friends gonna call me: hey dreamer
The stars you're watching are so far 
Tonight I know I will get there
By plane or by bus - right to my star

Pretend there are things you just don't know 
In spite someone's told you are so cute
You have to ask and I will show
The snow in the summer or so, so

If my star would fall
Or disappear at all

I will follow my star till the end of my days, 
And my heart's gonna lead me through so many ways, 
And if you're join me I'll be your guide, 
Baby, 'never say never', be my 'runaway bride' 

My friends gonna tell me: just calm down
The clouds you're walking are so high
This is my chance, and I'll invite
All the dreamers and lovers to fly (fly).

I'm back from the future, life goes on,
But still I remember my promise
You have to ask and I will show
The snow in the summer or so, so

If my star would fall
Or disappear at all

I will follow my star till the end of my days, 
And my heart's gonna lead me through so many ways, 
And if you're join me I'll be your guide, 
Baby, 'never say never', be my 'runaway bride' 

My 'runaway bride'
Hey, hey, hey,
Heyeah

If my star would fall
Or disappear at all

I will follow my star till the end of my days, 
And my heart's gonna lead me through so many ways, 
And if you're gonna join me I'll be your guide, 
Baby, 'never say never', be my 'Runaway bride'

La, la, la,
Hey, hey
Be my 'runaway'
