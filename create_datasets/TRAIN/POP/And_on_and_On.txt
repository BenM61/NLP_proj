This is a song about 
Summertime 
(Cool summer yeah cool summer) 
May it never end, may it never end 
(Feeling goes on, cool summer, feeling goes on, feeling goes on)
This is a summer of love and the love will go 

On and on and on and on 

I'm not gonna stop, no 
I don't wanna stop, no 
I'm not gonna stop, no ooh 
(Come on, the beat don't stop 'til the break of dawn)
I'm not gonna stop, no 
I don't wanna stop, no 
I'm not gonna stop, no ooh 

And this feeling goes on and on and on and on and on 
And my loving goes on and on and on and on and on 
(Come on, come on, come on, come on) 

Ooh
What a feeling 
What a feeling 
Gotta keep this going 
I got the top down 
Sun is beaming as I'm thinking about you 
Never will you stop this love that you feel 
And I'll do the same with you everyday 
I will always be right here by your side 
I don't want nobody else 

And this feeling goes on and on and on and on and on
And my loving goes on and on and on and on and on 

(Come on, the beat don't stop 'til the break of dawn)
I'm not gonna stop, no 
I don't wanna stop, no 
I'm not gonna stop, no ooh 

Ooh 
What a feeling 
Got me smiling 
As I'm dreaming about you 
Oh you're my baby 
So believe me when I tell ya
Never will I stop this love that I feel 
And you do the same each and everyday 
I will always be right here by your side 
I don't want nobody else 

And this feeling goes on and on and on and on and on
And my loving goes on and on and on and on and on 

Feel it 
Yeah 
Top down 
Just coolin 
Summertime 

Feeling goes on 
Feeling goes on 
(Come on, the beat don't stop 'til the break of dawn) 
Damn this is a long song 
(Come on, the beat don't stop 'til the break of dawn) 

And this feeling goes on and on and on and on and on
And my loving goes on and on and on and on and on 
Feeling goes on and on and on and on and on 

I'm not gonna stop, no 
I don't wanna stop, no 
I'm not gonna stop, no ooh 
I'm not gonna stop, no 
I don't wanna stop, no 
I'm not gonna stop, no ooh
