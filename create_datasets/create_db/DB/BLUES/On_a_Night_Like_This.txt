On a night like this, I'm so glad you came around
Hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce
It sure feels right, on a night like this

Well on a night like this, i,'m so glad you're here to stay
Hold on to me, pretty miss and say you'll never go away to stray
Run your fingers down my spine, bring me a touch of bliss
And it sure feels right, on a night like this

Well on a night like this, I can't get any sleep
The air is so cold outside and the snow's so very deep
Build a fire, throw on logs and listen to it hiss
And let it burn, burn, burn, burn, on a night like this

Get your body next to mine and keep me company
There is plenty a room for all, but don't you elbow me

Let the four winds blow, around this old cabin door
If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before
There's more frost on the window glass, with each new tender kiss
And I sure feels right, on a night like this
