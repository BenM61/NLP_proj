Lookin' for love at the back of a taxi,
Got lucky in a cheap hotel.
Hot pants, mm... nasty.
Don't bother knockin' 'cause you know damn well.

This blind date is cash and carry,
Dead ringer for the big first prize.
Chance meeting in the roaring eighties.
You ain't going home tonight.

So shake it slowly
And do that bump and grind.

Well, I can tell you a few reservations.
More value, pass the buck.
I may be wrong but I think she kinda likes ya.
Think quick or you're out of luck.

This blind date is cash and carry,
We have a winner for the big first prize.
Chance meeting in the roaring eighties.
You ain't going nowhere tonight.

Shake it slowly
And do that bump and grind.
Rotate slowly,
Make it bump and grind.

Oo, I feel romantic.
Oo, I want to let you know.
Have you ever really studied dancing
Or do you make it up as you go?

Shake it slowly,
Do that bump and grind.
Move it slowly
And make it bump and grind.
