It's not hard to believe
That the world isn't real
When the sun doesn't shine in your eyes
All the time

It's not hard to concede
As we cry and we bleed everyday
We just won't leave
Feel your heart stop

Still alive but you're not
So you scream that you've had enough
Done enough, said enough

See the reflections of lives that you've changed
As you look in the mirror and try to believe
It's been hard that I know
But I could have told you so you reap what you sow

Can you see in my face
All these tears I saved for you
Can you see it's not right
That our love was never real

Is it right to hold on to the words that we spoke
Even though now that feeling is gone in your eyes
It's been hard to let you go
Even though you found someone new

Everyday
It's been hard to find
With no peace of mind

Can you see in my face
All these tears I saved for you
Can you see it's not right
That our love was never real
