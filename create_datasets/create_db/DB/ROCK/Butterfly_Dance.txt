Everything you do is true as long as you believe it
And everything you say is play and that's how you should treat it 
And everyone is high until there's something makes them low 
That's when you should stay, that's not the time to go 
No, no, no, no, no, no 
That's when you should stay and let your love just flow

Lady lady won't you come here quick 
This whiskey and wine is making me sick 
I want you now and I don't t care why 
You crazy beautiful butterfly 
And it could take all night to get a single thing right 
It could take all day to find something to say
Ask me a question and I'll tell you a lie 
Ask me another, I'll spit in your eye 
Don't like to leave you but I know I can't stay 
So just keep lovin' in your butterfly way 
And it could take all night to get a single thing right 
It could take all day to find something to say
Too much and too many things on my mind 
Can't make a story of things I can't find 
Rock and roll music playin' in my head 
Gonna keep on dancin' till I drop down dead 
It could take all night to get a single thing right
It could take all day to find something to say

Lady lady won't you come here quick 
Cause these evil drugs are makin' me sick 
I want you now and I don't care why 
You crazy beautiful butterfly 
And it could take all night to get a single thing right 
It could take all day to find something to say 
Magical Margaret 
You know you're so high above 
You fill my head with music 
My heart with love 
And it could take all night to get a single thing right 
It could take all day to find something to say 
Magical Margaret
