There's something in the way you move,
Everybody wants you,
To me you are, a shining star,
Baby what do I do,
To make you see, you're the one for me,
Baby won't you realise.

Girl we could be doin' it, doin' it, doin' it, doin' it,
All night long,
Makin' it, makin' it, makin' sweet love.

It's the way you move your body,
Supersexually, you are the one for me,
So baby move your body,
A little closer to me, so everybody can see,
There's no doubt that you're what I want,
Everything that I need,
'cause you do me Supersexually.

Come over here, so what's your name?
Everybody's watching,
I'll buy the drinks, I'll play the game,
But only if it's worth it,
I guess you heard, it all before,
But baby I ain't telling lies.

Girl we could be doin it, doin it, doin it, doin' it,
All night long,

Makin' it, makin' it, makin' sweet love,

It's the way you move your body,
Supersexually, you are the one for me,
So baby move your body,
A little closer to me, so everybody can see,
There's no doubt that you're what I want,
Everything that I need,
'cause you do me Supersexually.
