It's not the first time that I'm feeling, feeling alone
It's not the last time that tears will flow
I pray to God, I pray to everybody
Who can help me?
You should know, you should know where to go
I close my eyes and see
A birth, a son of you and me
I close my eyes and feel
Your breath, your touch be there for me

It's not the first time I say 'hello', you say 'goodbye'
A misunderstanding's the reason why
It's not the last time I say 'hello', you say 'goodbye'
Remember all the dreams we shared for so long
For so long time

I close my eyes and see
A birth, a son of you and me
I close my eyes and feel
Your breath, your touch
Your breath, your touch
Be there, be there for me
