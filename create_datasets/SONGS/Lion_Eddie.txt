Lion Eddie, let's go steady
When I need you I can feed you
Lion Eddie, let's go steady
When I need you I can feed you
With my love and music sound

At first he knocked me out
And then he went away
And no one hit and ran
Like Eddie did today
Uh uh uh uh I'm so alone
I want him home
Bring him home

Lion Eddie, let's go steady
I just need you here around
When I need you I can feed you
With my love and music sound
Lion Eddie, let's go steady
I just need you here around
When I need you I can feed you
With my love and music sound

I'm so afraid
I'll never see him here again
I lost my lover
And my one and only friend

Uh, uh, uh, uh, I'm so alone
I want him home
Bring him home

Lion Eddie, let's go steady
I just need you here around
When I need you I can feed you
With my love and music sound
Lion Eddie, let's go steady
I just need you here around
When I need you I can feed you
With my love and music sound

Uh uh uh uh I'm so alone
I want him home, bring him home

Lion Eddie, let's go steady
I just need you here around
When I need you I can feed you
With my love and music sound
Lion Eddie, let's go steady
I just need you here around
When I need you I can feed you
With my love and music sound
