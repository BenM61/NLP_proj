With a whoop and a holler and a dime and a dollar
I'm a lucky son of a gun
Wherever I go I guess you know
I tip my hat to none
With a whoop and a holler and a dime and a dollar
I'm a lucky son of a gun.

I'm just a rollin' stone, I wander on my own,
And always take my own advice
I've travelled every trail, and never been in jail
â€˜Cos I've deserved it once or twice

My horse has been my pal, but once I met a gal,
And thought a kiss would be no crime
I darn near lost my life, she was the sheriff's wife,
I just got out of town in time.

With a whoop and a holler and a dime and a dollar
I'm a lucky son of a gun
Wherever I go I guess you know
I tip my hat to none
With a whoop and a holler and a dime and a dollar
I'm a lucky son of a gun.

(Short Musical Break)

Now when I leave a town and get to beddin' down
I kinda wink up at the stars
Nobody knows my name, they only know I came
And drank my weight in all the bars

With a whoop and a holler and a dime and a dollar
I'm a lucky son of a gun
Wherever I go I guess you know
I tip my hat to none
With a whoop and a holler and a dime and a dollar
I'm a lucky son of a gun.
