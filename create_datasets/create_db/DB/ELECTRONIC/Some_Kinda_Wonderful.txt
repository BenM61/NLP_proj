Clap your hands if it feels good
It does indeed, goddamnit

I've been thinking we're meant to be
But I don't know how to show you the best of me
Yeah, I want you, do you want me, too?
Yeah, I want you, do you want me, too?
Showing up in your beat up truck
And now I'm sure it's more than a stroke of luck
Yeah, I love you, do you love me, too?
Yeah, I love you, do you love me, too?

Clap your hands if it feels good
Clap your hands, oh
Clap your hands if it feels good
Clap your hands, oh

Feeling tonight, some kinda wonderful
Feeling inside, some kinda wonderful
The rest of my life is some kinda wonderful
We will always be some kinda wonderful
Some kinda wonderful

I keep showing up in the nines
But you show me you know it's a waste of time
'Cause you want me and I want you, too
'Cause you want me and I want you, too
You've been loving me just for me
You don't care what I wear, and I can't believe
That you love me and I love you, too
Yeah, you love me and I love you, too

Clap your hands if it feels good
Clap your hands, oh
Clap your hands if it feels good
Clap your hands, oh

Feeling tonight, some kinda wonderful
Feeling inside, some kinda wonderful
The rest of my life is some kinda wonderful
We will always be some kinda wonderful
Some kinda wonderful
Some kinda wonderful

I feel you in my body, my soul
You're taking me to heaven, I'm whole
So go tell everybody we've got a sound
That's some kinda wonderful
I've been thinking we're meant to be
And I love that you love to be loving me

Feeling tonight, some kinda wonderful (I feel you in my body)
Feeling inside, some kinda wonderful (you're taking me to heaven)
The rest of my life is some kinda wonderful
We will always be some kinda wonderful
Some kinda wonderful
Some kinda wonderful
