So much, you can't get home
Somehow you lost the wind,
Come up, come up for air
In your mind you have feet ten (?)

You're sure, you're sure your soul
Goes up and in and down
The only dream you own
Wears you out

No ordinary joy,
You will always miss your mark
All the way,
So in the factory
I knew you messed it up
With me.

And now you're missing more
And now you're missing more,
And now you're missing home.

Uncross your eyes and breath
You'll be missing in your skin
Forget where you come from
Imagination always wins

It's locked in the froze
The day passing blue
Too much for everyone
Just try for you

It's no ordinary joy,
You will always miss your mark
All the way
So in the factory
I knew you messed it up
For me.

It's no ordinary joy
You always missed your mark
All the way down.
So in the factory
I knew you messed it up
For me.
