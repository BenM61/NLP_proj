Bratz, Forever Diamondz

Forever Diamondz, girls
One more time
Oh, shine

You've got a style your very own
Don't be afraid to let it show
Come on, express yourself, the way that you feel
Be who you are 'cause you shine like a star

Stir it, love it, work it
'Cause you got it going on

Forever Diamondz, girls
On the catwalk of the world
They know they mean yourself
And everyone can tell

Bratz, Forever Diamondz
Shining like diamondz

You are an individual
So let everybody know
Go on and be yourself, anyway you want to
You're a superstar and you know that you are

Stir it, love it, work it
It's your song and your groove

Forever Diamondz, girls
On the catwalk of the world
They know they mean yourself
And everyone can tell

Bratz, Forever Diamondz

Bratz, Forever Diamondz
Shine, shine, shine, shine

Shining like real diamondz
Shining like real diamondz

Shining like real diamondz
Bratz, Forever Diamondz, girl

You've got a style your very own

'Cause you got it going on

Forever Diamondz, girls
On the catwalk of the world
They know they mean yourself
