I make faces, I make faces
But I can't get into your window
I make wax dolls, I stick pins in
To the most exciting places

Oh, you're so aluminium
Oh, you're so aluminium
It could be so lovely, it could be so lovely

Your name's gorgeous, your name's ugly
Your name's written on my tombstone
Your name's worthless, your name's useless
Your just another welfare number

Oh, you're so aluminium
Oh, you're so aluminium
It could be so lovely, it could be so lovely

Oh, oh, oh, you're so aluminium
Oh, oh, oh, you're so aluminium
It could be so lovely, it could be so lovely

I make faces, I make faces
But I can't get into your window
I make wax dolls, I stick pins in
To the most exciting places

Oh, you're so aluminium
Oh, oh, oh, you're so aluminium
It could be so lovely, it could be so lovely
