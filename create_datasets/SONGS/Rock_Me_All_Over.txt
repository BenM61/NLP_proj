I see you out there every night, waitin' for the show 
My eyes are focused on you, but you don't even know 
I sit up here an' love you, though I know that you can't see... 
I can't believe what's happening to me 

The music starts to break, I feel my body shake 
I'm losin' control... 
You're a movin' fantasy, look what you've done to me... 
You've taken my soul... 

When you want me, you can have me 
I'm dyin' for you, to 
(Rock me all over, rock me all over, rock me all over) 

I get so excited, when I hear your thunder roar 
I can't stop myself, I keep comin' back for more 
You live in your splendour, and I am in my dream 
Sing to me baby, I want to hear ya scream 

There's fire in my veins, an' yet I feel no pain 
Just this hunger for you... 
I'm aching deep inside, I won't be satisfied 
'Til you're, achin' too... 

You can have me, come an' take me 
I'm dyin' for you, to 
(Rock me all over, rock me all over, rock me all over) 
Aww... come on an' rock 

Ho-whoa-whoa-whoa 
Yeah-h yeah... 
Ho-whoa-whoa-whoa 
Ho-oh... 
(Rock me all over) (rock, rock), (rock me all over) (rock, rock) 
(Rock me all over) (rock, rock), (rock me all over) 

(Rock me all over) (rock, rock), (rock me all over) 
(Rock me all over) (rock, rock), (rock me all over) 
(Rock me all over) (rock rock rock) 
(Rock me all over) (rock, rock) 
(Rock me all over) (rock rock rock) 
(Rock me all over) (rock rock rock rock) 
(Rock me all over) (rock rock rock rock) (rock me all over)
