Is that the old man walking in the dark?
Is that the old man walking in the dark?

Take me home
Where them broken brights
Are shining down
Make me feel alright

When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young

Is that the old man walking in the dark?
Is that the old man walking in the dark?
Is that the old man walking in the dark?
Is that the old man walking in the dark?

Shake them bones
Let me love tonight
We'll grow young
Make me feel alright

When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young

Is that the old man walking in the dark?
Is that the old man walking in the dark?
Is that the old man walking in the dark?
Is that the old man?
