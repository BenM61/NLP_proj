Pimp dolls, jam
Jigglettes, slam
Pimp dolls, jam
Jigglettes, slam

Just because I shake and party
And roll my sexy body
don't mean that I'm tryin to tease
Its called body talk
Its not like the walk
cause this time
you're wearin blue jeans

You rub your left leg slow
And let your body go
And do a little sexy scream
Jam, lets party out
Make your body sweat and shout
A visual sex machine
you're talkin

Body talk
Talk body to me, body talk
(talk body to me)
Body talk
Talk body to me, body talk

Jigglettes gonna slam
Pimp dolls gonna jam
Let your body talk to me
you're lookin real fine
you're workin overtime
you're footloose and fancy free

Now its all about the feel
cause now you know the deal
So pump your body cross the floor
And put it in the groove
Gonna make it real smooth
And then you'll want some more
you're talkin

Hook
Spoken:
Say baby, what's that you're doin? 
Well, it looks like your body is talkin to me
I'm hearin something
what's that? 
Go on, get it, girl

Sexy body
Sure looks good to me
Body talk with me
Your sexy body (oh baby)
Sure looks good to me
Body talk, slam

Come on and shake your body
I want to hear your body
So come on and shake your body
I want to hear your body

Your body, your body, your body
Your sexy body
Sure looks good to me
Body talk with me
Your sexy body (oh baby)
Sure looks good to me

Hook
Spoken:
Mmm, there she is again
I wonder what she was tryin to say to me
be	-o-d-why t-a-l-k, ooh talk baby

Hook 2 times
I like the way you wa
