 

When I'm away from you
No wonder I feel blue
Without your love (without your love)
Without your charms
Want you in my arms

I dream about you every night
Hopin', waitin' for you to write
Until at last (until at last)
I find, can't get you off my mind
(off my mind, can't get you off my mind)

If you only knew
How my poor heart yearns for you
Then darling you'll be
Ever true and faithful to me

So when I'm by your side
Please remember how I cried
For your love (for your love)
For your charms
Want you in my arms (in my arms, want you in my arms)

If you only knew
How my poor heart yearns for you
Then darling you'll be
Ever true and faithful to me

So when I'm by your side
Please remember how I cried
For your love (for your love)
For your charms
Want you in my arms
