Oh Baby, oh baby, oh baby
I see myself in your face, a reflection of pain
Somebody made you cry over and over again
Still you and I made it through all of this for a reason
Yes, we did
Could it be that we created affair for all seasons

'Cause you and I were meant to be lovers
The search is over for us, there's no other
We're finally at the rainbow's end
Baby, together we'll mend all the cracks in our heart
And just love all the hurt away
(Love the hurt away)

Woman, you are the thing that I hoped and I prayed for
You gave your love and I'm happy like never before
Love and I love it
You be the strength and I'll be your shoulder to lean on
You can lean on my shoulder
Building a world and fill our whole place with our love songs

'Cause you and I were meant to be lovers
The search is over for us, there's no other
We're finally at the rainbow's end
Baby, together we'll mend all the cracks in our heart
And love all the hurt away

'Cause you and I were meant to be lovers
The search is over for us, there's no other
We're finally at the rainbow's end
Baby, together we'll mend all the cracks in our heart
And just love all the hurt away
(Love the hurt away)

Love all the hurt away
(Love the hurt away)
And love all the hurt away
(Love the hurt away)

Yes, we're gonna love
We're gonna love, baby
Yes, we're gonna love all the hurt, baby
We're gonna love, love, love, love, love, love
(Love the hurt away)
All the hurt away
