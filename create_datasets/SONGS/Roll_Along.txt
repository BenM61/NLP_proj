Oh, the mysteries of any given time
Are thoughts for another day
It's all for another day
And then you shut the door
And you hurry away
And leave these thoughts for another day
The kind of thoughts that get in the way

And you can't keep life from moving on
So roll along 'till there's nowhere to go
And you can't get by from moving on
So roll along 'till there's nowhere to go

And your sweetness is rising out of wine
And so we laugh for another day
And on into another day
And you said I'd be more useful if I had the time
But that's a thought for another day

The kind of thought that gets in the way

And you can't get by from moving on
So roll along 'till there's nowhere to go
And you can't keep life from moving on
So roll along 'till there's nowhere to go

Would you keep asking the same questions
About the nature of time
But they take far too long to answer
Why don't we just go outside?

And you can't keep life from moving on
So roll along 'till there's nowhere to go
And you can't get by from moving on
So roll along 'till there's nowhere to go
Nowhere to go
