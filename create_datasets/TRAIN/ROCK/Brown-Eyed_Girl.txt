Hey now where did we go
Oh yeah, days when the rains came
Way down in the hollow
Yeah, playin' a new game

Laughin' and a runnin', hey, hey, hey
Skippin' and a jumpin',
In the misty morning fog
Oh baby and our hearts a thumpin'
And you
My brown eyed girl
You, my brown eyed girl

Do you remember when
Yeah we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la la la la la
I hear a song makes me think of a girl I used to know
Hey, hey, hey, hey
I sing along when I hear it on the radio now

Now that the years gone by
Yeah, now that I'm on my own
Saw you just the other day
Oh my, baby you have grown
Cast my memory back there, Lord
Sometimes I am overcome just thinkin' 'bout it
Playin ball in the green grass
Behind the stadium with you
My brown eyed girl
You, my brown eyed girl
You, my brown eyed girl

Do you remember when
Yeah, we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la la la la la
Sha la la la da la la la da da da la
Sha la la la la la la la la la la la
I hear a song makes me think of a girl I used to know
Hey, hey, hey
I sing along when I hear it on the radio
Hey, hey, hey
I sing along when I hear it on the radio now
