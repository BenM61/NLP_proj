I'm Alabamy bound,
There'll be no heebie jeebies hangin' round.
Just gave the meanest ticket mam on earth
All I'm worth,
To put my tootsies in an upper berth.

Just hear that choo-choo sound,
I know that soon we're gonna cover ground,
And then I'll holler so
The world will know,
Here I go!
I'm Alabamy bound!

I can hear that choo-choo whistle blow,
Watch that engine when we start to go!
Now we're in Baltimore,
Knockin' at Dixie's door!

What's that bill?
Louisville!
We passed that before!
Field o' cotton, tell me where I am,
Hear that fella yellin', "Alabam!".

Mammy!
Mammy!
Get your kisses ready for your honey lamb!

I'm Alabamy bound,
There'll be no heebie jeebies hangin' round.
Just gave the meanest ticket mam on earth
All I'm worth,
To put my tootsies in an upper berth.

I'm just a lucky lucky hound
To have someone to put my arms around!
That's why I'm shoutin' for the world to know,
Here I go!
I'm Alabamy bound!
