So it cannot hurt you 

You only have to look behind you 
At who's underlined you

Everything you touch you don't feel 
Do not know what you steal 
Shakes your hand 
Takes your gun 
Walks you out of the sun

What you touch do not feel 
Do not know what you steal 
Destroy everything you touch today 
Please destroy me this way

Everything you touch you don't feel 
Do not know what you steal 
Shakes your hand 
Takes your gun 
Walks you out of the sun

Once you touch do not feel 
Do not know what you steal 
Destroy everything you touch today 
Please destroy me this way 

Everything you touch you don't feel 
Do not know what you steal 
Shakes your hand 
Takes your gun 
Walks you out of the sun

Once you touch you don't feel 
Do not know what you steal 
Destroy everything you touch today 
Please destroy me this way 

Everything you touch you don't feel
