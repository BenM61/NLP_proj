I used to see these Scandinavian looking ladies 
All the way down half a crowded block 
And I used to chase those yellow headed ladies 
But it was never you on my block 

I used to press my nose against the stone cold glass 
At Fireside's liquor store 
At the coin-op laundromat, on 15th and Montana 
At sweet Suzy Q's up around the corner 

The way you call to the woods 
Is how the woods call back to you 

I used to hear the front door slam 
I'd run right out into the street
Doing that crazy dance 
Spinning left to right 
My head in my hands 
My momma left me alone tonight 
And she always said 
The way you call to the woods 
Is how the woods call back to you 

How am I gonna get my work done 
With you looking at me? 
I bring home the bacon 
Fry it up in a pan 
I wear that sweet perfume 
To find myself a better man 

The way you call to the woods 
Is how the woods call back to you
