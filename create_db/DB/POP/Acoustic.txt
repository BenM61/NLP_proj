Baby, we could strip it down
We could take it back to basics
Baby, we control the sound
We could make it wake the neighbours
But baby, let's be quiet now
Reach out, pull down on the fader

We don't have to get so theatrical
'Cause you know even simple can be special

We don't have to get loud to lose it
All we need is just me and you
We don't have to scream out to prove it
We could keep it all acoustic
Ooh, keep it all acoustic
Ooh, if you keep it all

Let me see the real you
Baby, take off all your make-up
Undress me to the naked truth
Until we're both uncomplicated
'Cause all the things we wanna do
Are so much better when we're naked

We don't have to get so theatrical
'Cause you know even simple can be special

We don't have to get loud to lose it
All we need is just me and you
We don't have to scream out to prove it
We could keep it all acoustic
And ooh, keep it all acoustic
Ooh, keep it all

Your fingertips on my neck, oh
Pull me in close to your lips, oh

We don't have to get loud to lose it
All we need is just me and you
We don't have to scream out to prove it
We could keep it all acoustic
We don't have to get loud to lose it
All we need is just me and you
We don't have to scream out to prove it
We could keep it all acoustic
And ooh, keep it all acoustic
Ooh, keep it all
