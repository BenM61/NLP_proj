Barenaked

Did you ever have a dream
where you're walking naked down the street
And everyone just stares
Did ya ever feel so deep yet to speak your mind
you put others straight to sleep
you wonder if anybody cares
Sometimes I think I'm the only one whose day turned out
Unlike it had began

And I feel barenaked and I just can't take it
I'm getting jaded no I just can't take it anymore 
'cause I'm barenaked and I know
Life's what you make it
Wish I could float away to some other day

Did you ever go downstairs to start your day but your car's not there
Yeah you know the joke's on you
Did ya ever try your luck with a pick-up line
But you just sucked
You tell yourself it wasn't you
And I know it's hard to hold it inside
It's days like these I run and hide

When I feel barenaked and I just can't take it 
I'm getting jaded no I just can't take it anymore
'cause I'm barenaked and I know
Life's what you make it 
Wish I could float away to some other day

It's all a state of mind
But I don't mind
Trying to find a way to keep my head above the mess I make
What the world creates
Sometimes it feels so good to let it all fall as we will fall
I may fall we all fall
And then the world comes tumbling down down down down down

I'm barenaked and I just can't take it 
I'm getting jaded no I just can't take it anymore
'cause I'm barenaked and I know
Life's what you make it 
Wish I could float away to some other day

When I feel
Barenaked
I feel you feel we all feel
