She, ties her hair up tight
Puts her armour on
When she steps outside
She, lives in black and white
And the colours gone,
But its in her eyes

Time and time again we're going back to the start
And I try and try again to bring some light to the dark
I know everyday's a battle and it tears her apart
And I don't know why
And I'm picking up the pieces when they fall to her feet
She's been fighting all the demons so she'll never be free
She's been hiding in the shadows yeah its hard to believe,
But I don't know why

Love, don't ever change the way you are,
You light the sky just like a star
I don't care what you say you're
Beautiful to me, oh

She, she never gets it right
And it feels like rain on a perfect night
And I'll, I'll be a hand to hold
You can push me hard, but I won't let go

Time and time again we're going back to the start
And I try and try again to bring some light to the dark
I know everyday's a battle and it tears her apart
Don't you cry my

Love, don't ever change the way you are,
You light the sky just like a star,
I don't care what you say you're
Beautiful to me

Love, open your arms and let it go,
You're so amazing don't you know,
I don't care what you say you're
Beautiful to me, oh

Light breaks through your hair and
They all stop and stare and
I'd go anywhere oh why can't you just see that
I'm crazy about you
I can't live without you
You don't see it but you're
Beautiful to me

Love, don't ever change the way you are
You light the sky just like a star
I don't care what you say you're
Beautiful to me, oh

Love, don't ever change the way you are
You light the sky just like a star
I don't care what you say you're
Beautiful to me

Love, open your heart and let it go
You're so amazing don't you know
I don't care what you say you're
Beautiful to me

You're beautiful to me
