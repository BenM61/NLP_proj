Sun's out
Not a thought about the rain
No trace of tears or pain
I hope you're having
A wonderful life

Reaching out
I've thought about you often
My feelings towards you softened over time
I hope you're having
A wonderful life

Truth be told
There's gold in growing older
We open like the roses to the sun
OR the hand of a child
Reaching up to mother over time

For a pot of gold
Or so I have been told
Waits at the rainbow's end
Where all the colors blend
I hope you're having a wonderful life
I hope you get everything that's coming to you
I got everything one's supposed to get
Nothing more and nothing less
Life's been completely fair
Eternally even

Walking in the shadows I
See clearly I'm
Walking in the light
I see clearly I'm
Out of my mind
Out of my mind
Walking in the shadows I
I see clearly I'm
Walking in the light
Out of my mind
Walking in the shadows I
Out of my mind
Walking in the shadows I
Out of my mind
Walking in the shadows I
Out of my mind
