I don't know what it is
That makes me love you so
I only know
I never want to let you go
'cause you started something
Can't you see
That ever since we've met
You've had a hold on me
It happens to be true
I only want to be with you

It doesn't matter where you go
Or what you do
I'd love to spend
Each moment of the day with you
Look what has happened
Just one kiss
I never knew that I that I could be in
Love like this
It's crazy but it's true
I only want to be with you

You stopped, you smiled at me
And asked if I'd care to dance
I fell into your open arms
I didn't stand a chance
Now listen honey
I just want to be beside you everywhere
As long as we're together, honey
I don't care
'cause you started something
Now can't you see
That ever since we've met
You've had a hold on me
No matter what you do
I only want to be with you
