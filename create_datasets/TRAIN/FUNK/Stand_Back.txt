When I first met you, baby
You were like a star in my night
Reaching down to rescue me
You took me on a flight

Then you tried to put your change on me
Tellin' me what I shouldn't do
Shadowing my every move
I can't escape from you

Stand back
Give me room to move in
If you want my time
Ooh, you better stand back
Better keep your distance
Can you read my mind'

Treat me like a lady is
But don't you cramp my style
I've got to live my own life too
To make it worth my while

When I step out in the evening
I can't tell you when I'll return
I'm the pilot of my destiny
It's something you've got to know

So stand back
Give me room to move in
If you want my time
Ooh, you better stand back
Better keep your distance
Can you read my mind'

I'm not saying, I don't need your love
Keep me satisfied, yeah
I'm just like any other girl
I can share my heart only if you treat me right

Whoa, oh, yeah
My love, ooh
Oh, oh, oh

Stand back
Give me room to move in
If you want my time
You better stand back
Oh, better keep your distance
Can you read my mind, ooh

(Stand back)
Give me room to move in, oh, oh,
If you want my time, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Stand back)
Better keep your distance
Can you read my mind' Ooh, ooh, oh

Why don't you
(Stand back)
Give me room to move in
If you want my time, oh, oh, oh
(Stand back)
Better keep your distance, oh
Can you read my mind, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

(Stand back)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh
(Stand back)
Ooh, ho, oh
(Stand back)
Oh, ooh, oh, ooh

(Stand back)
Ooh, ooh, oh, hoo
(Stand back)
Oh, hoo, hoo, oh, oh, ooh, ooh
(Stand back)
Oh, ho, hoo, oh, ho, hoo

(Stand back)
Oh, ho, ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo, oh, ooh
(Stand back)
Oh, oh, oh, ooh, ooh, oh
Why don't you stand back
