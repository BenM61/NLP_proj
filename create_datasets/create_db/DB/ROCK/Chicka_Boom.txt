Chicka-boom, chicka-rack
Chicka-boom, chicka-rack
Chicka-boom, chicka-rack, she's singin'
Her shooes paddy-wack in front and the back
And her yellow curls go swingin'
Bells just rang, Bo-o-o-ing
My eyes lit up and my heart went bang
Her shoes paddy-wack in the front and the back
Chicka-boom, chicka-racky-boom

It was way up in Alaska
And the moment that I passed her
In my heart a little bugle blew attack
Though I knew I should resist her
I walked up to her and kissed her
And she didn't slap my face, she kissed me back

Chicka-boom, chicka-rack
Chicka-boom, chicka-rack
Chicka-boom, chicka-rack, she's singin'
Her shooes paddy-wack in front and the back
And her yellow curls go swingin'
Bells just rang, Bo-o-o-ing
My eyes lit up and my heart went bang
Her shoes paddy-wack in the front and the back
Chicka-boom, chicka-racky-boom

Told me she was from Seattle
Where her Daddy raises cattle
But she's far away from home and so forlorn
Said the Yukon had her freezin'
And it would be mighty pleasin'
If I'd hug her once or twice to keep her warm

Chicka-boom, chicka-rack
Chicka-boom, chicka-rack
Chicka-boom, chicka-rack, she's singin'
Her shooes paddy-wack in the front and the back
And her yellow curls go swingin'
Bells just rang, Bo-o-o-ing
My eyes lit up and my heart went bang
Her shoes paddy-wack in front and the back
Chicka-boom, chicka-racky-boom

Oh, for her love I'd swim to China
But I'm not a rich goldminer
I can't give her things like rings an' fancy furs
But I'm still not gonna back-up
Gonna paint my little shack up
I'll tell her if she wants it, well it's hers

Chicka-boom, chicka-rack
Chicka-boom, chicka-rack
Chicka-boom, chicka-rack, she's singin'
Her shoes paddy-wack in the front and the back
And her yellow curls go swingin'
Bells just rang, Bo-o-o-ing
My eyes lit up and my heart went bang
Her shoes paddy-wack in the front and the back
(Her shoes paddy-wack in the front and the back)
Chicka-boom, chicka-rack, chicka-boom, chicka-rack
(Chicka-boom, chicka-rack, chicka-boom, chicka-rack)
Chicka-boom, chicka-rack
Boom, chicka-rack
Boom, chicka-rack
Chicka-boom
