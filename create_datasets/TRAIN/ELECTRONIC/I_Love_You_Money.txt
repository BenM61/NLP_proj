You live in a man's world
Man, man, man's world
I tell you I don't want to anymore
Let's sing na na na na
Kick you out the door

You live in a man's world
I live in my own world
I tell you I don't want to anymore
You sing na na na na
Kick you out the door

I don't want you anymore
And I kick you out the door

Loved and rusty, take my hand
I'm not for you, you're not my man
You take to me and we dance, dance, dance
It's not for love and not for romance

Na na na na na
Gonna kick you out the door

Money hey

Money hey
Do you want me?

Money hey

Money hey
Do you want me?

Do you want me, too?
I wanna know 'cause I can't help this anymore
All I wanna know is are you gonna come on home?

Do you want me, too?
I wanna know 'cause I can't help this anymore
All I wanna know is are you gonna come on home?

I love you
