I woke up so sad one morning
And there were reasons
For that bad morning
Something told me
You're not ready for this change

I got up stepped into the
Shower, and I thought:
It will be gone
About an hour or so

But something told me
This feeling comes from
Deep inside
And suddenly ran teardrops,
Just like the water
And I lost, I lost the fight
And it felt like someone
Had died away from me
And myself died a thousand times

Have I lost my sense and strength
Are my eyes just full of you
Why come the pictures
Reminding me of love
Suddenly ran teardrops,
Just like the water
And I lost, I lost the fight
And it felt like someone
Had died away from me
And myself died a thousand times
