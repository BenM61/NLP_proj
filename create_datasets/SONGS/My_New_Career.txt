I never wanted to be on my own 
I could be wrong 
But I slipped away from home 
And now I'm gone 

Well, way down south 
They're haveing minor ups and downs 
But they are moving on ahead 
In leaps and bounds 

Why, boy, they're playing our song 
Outside where no-one can hear 
Why, boy, they're playing our song 
At the start of my new career 

Well it's a different walk of life 
That I've come to know 
Because at every port of call comes a time to go 

Well they say down south 
The sun won't set on my home town 
It's just driving in this heat 
That gets me down 

Why, boy, they're playing our song 
Outside where no-one can hear 
Why, boy, they're playing our song 
At the start of my new career 

I could never hurt anyone 
Least of all you 

Why, boy, they're playing our song 
Outside where no-one can hear 
Why, boy, they're playing our song 
At the start of my new career
