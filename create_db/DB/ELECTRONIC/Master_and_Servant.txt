It's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot
It's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, like life

There's a new game we like to play you see
A game with added reality
You treat me like a dog
Get me down on my knees

We call it master and servant
We call it master and servant

It's a lot like life
This play between the sheets
With you on top and me underneath
Forget all about equality

Let's play master and servant
Let's play master and servant

It's a lot like life and that's what's appealing
If you despise that throwaway feeling
From disposable fun
Then this is the one

Domination's the name of the game in bed or in life
They're both just the same
Except in one you're fulfilled at the end of the day

Let's play master and servant
Let's play master and servant

Master and servant
It's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot
It's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, like life
It's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot
It's a lot, it's a lot, master and servant
It's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot
It's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, like life

It's a lot like life and that's what's appealing
If you despise that throwaway feeling from disposable fun
Then this is the one

Let's play master and servant
Come on, master and servant
Let's play master and servant
Come on, master and servant
Let's play master and servant
Come on, master and servant
