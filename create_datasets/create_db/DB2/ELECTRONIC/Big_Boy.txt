Maybe if I spell it out
Big boy will take me out proper
He nailed my heart to you
While you never dusted off after

You're making me feel, uhh
Like what's real ain't real but it's real to me

Maybe if I'm a broken wing, big boy in my nest
You nailed my heart to your wall
And disposed of the rest of me

We threw, pushed and shoved, ohh
Like what's love ain't love
But it's love to me, oh

My boy is not a man yet
My boy is not a man yet
Oh boy, do I love it when you kiss my neck
Oh boy, last night was perfect

You're changing your mind, oh
Like what's mine ain't mine
But you're mine to be

Maybe if we try again, big boy
We could have it my way
You nailed my heart to your wall
But it was damaged anyways, oh

You're making me feel, oh
Like what's real ain't real
But it's real to me, oh
You're making me feel, oh
Like what's real ain't real
But it's real to me, whoa
