To take away our expression
Is to impoverish our existence

Oi!
Yeah, kick it.
Yeah.

It's insatiable;
What we're waiting for

So to keep us from falling apart
We'll write songs in the dark
And to keep us from fading away
We'll write for a better day

So to keep us from falling apart
We'll write songs in the dark
And to keep us from fading away
We'll write...

It will flourish, it will thrive
It will nourish;
A spring cleaning of the mind
It will flourish, it will thrive

To take away our expression
Is to impoverise our existence

They silence and censor
Our right to create
In cells we choke,
Without what is innate

So to keep us from falling apart
We'll write songs in the dark
And to stop us from fading away
We'll write for a better day

This vomiting of anguish and eruption of the soul
To radiate energy to comfort and console
To scatter our thoughts, to splatter our spirit
A blizzard of fire with all we transmit

So to keep us from falling apart
We'll write songs in the dark
And to stop us from fading away
We'll write for a better day

So to keep us from falling apart
We'll write songs in the dark
And to stop us from fading away
We'll write for a better...

So to keep us from falling apart
We'll write songs in the dark
And to keep us from fading away
We'll write for a better day

So to keep us from falling apart
We'll write songs in the dark
And to keep us from fading away
We'll write

It's insatiable
What we're waiting for

It's insatiable
What we're waiting for

It's insatiable
What we're waiting for

It's insatiable
What we're waiting for

It will flourish, it will thrive
It will nourish;
A spring cleaning of the mind
It will flourish, it will thrive
Yeah!

It's insatiable;
What we're waiting for
(woah-oh)

It's insatiable;
What we're waiting for
(woah-oh)

So to keep us from falling apart
We'll write songs in the dark
And to keep us from fading away
We'll write for a better day

So to keep us from falling apart
We'll write songs in the dark
And to stop us from fading away
We'll write for a better day
