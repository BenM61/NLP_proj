I know you hate that I think this way
I know you think that it's wrong of me
I know that everything is strong today
But the longer we go I know the fire will start to fade
I'm maybe walking to long for this race
I know you said that you won't do the same
And so I'm writing this song so the day
See I'm right I'm play this record with a smirk
While I say 

I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
I told you so

I know you hate that I think this way
I could be wrong but the chances ain't great
I know calls your sweet message
Will turn lately just to make me smile
To quite necessary
I know your vision your eye just see me
But somehow time seem to make it blurry
And so I'm writing this song so the day
I see I'm right, I'll play this record
While I cry and I say 

I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
I told you so

I know the newest of it all
Seems right but baby I'm no fool
And I got pride that happily ever
Love should just last a while.
I know you think you love me
But love ain't never stopped nobody
From creeping around every once in a while
When things start to settle down
And so I won't look like a clown
I' m a call it now 

I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
I told you so

I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
