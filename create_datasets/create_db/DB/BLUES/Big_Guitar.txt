Hey now boys take a look right here
Only one comes 'round every million years
She's a midnight rider on a shooting star
Makes the whole world ring like a big guitar

Well she flagged me down with the devil's sway
It was somewhere down that lost highway
She's a lifeboat on the raging sea
She's the high note in the harmony

She takes away my pain and sorrow
Loves me like there's no tomorrow
This, I can't resist
In my life I realize
I have never known a sweeter kiss
Honey what I missed

Got a piece of heaven right here on earth
And believe me I know what it's worth
She's an island dream on a rainy day
She's a desperado's hideaway

Hey now boys, take a look at right here
Only one comes 'round every million years
She's a midnight rider on a shooting star
Makes the whole ring like a big guitar
