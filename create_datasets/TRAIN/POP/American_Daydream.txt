We keep going, don't stop running
They keep selling, we don't want it
So close to it almost found a way 
Two steps closer, they keep coming
We keep yelling, we don't want it
Almost better, this things about to break

Why don't you make yourself available
In fact she told me that she wanted it free
It's easy

Oh no in love I'm just an animal
You said you want me but you want me when ya 
You want me but you want me when you're in need
Until the end, because 

We keep going, don't stop running
They keep selling, we don't want it
So close to it almost found a way 
Two steps closer, they keep coming
We keep yelling, we don't want it
Almost better, this things about to break

After it all it's still repairable
I know that I forgot my history
It's easy

Let's wave goodbye to all the terrible
I know there's a million things we could be
If we could only (???) and agree
Until the end because

We keep going, don't stop running
They keep selling, we don't want it
So close to it almost found a way 
Two steps closer, they keep coming
We keep yelling, we don't want it
Almost better, this things about to break

Oh it was a holiday
I always play and never work
But they sell us all (the bait?)
The western way 
I go berserk I go
