We all go down & I love every moment
You played & lost & you don't even know it
And every day breaks into a thousand pieces
And the rats leave ship, admitting isn't easy

'Cause I'm one-four-nine on a scale of ten
All you loathe is what I am
chapter 13

Shattered Dreams & A bad moon risin'
You dream of hell & your fear is no surprise
And I'm no prophet but your downfall is true
And the back of my head is now facing you

'Cause I'm one-four-nine on a scale of ten
All you loathe is what I am
chapter 13

'Cause I'm one-four-nine on a scale of ten
