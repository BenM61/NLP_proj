Let someone start believing in you
Let him hold out his hand
Let him touch you and watch what happens

Want someone who can look in your eyes
And see into your heart
Let him find you and watch what happens

Cold, no I won't believe your heart is cold
Maybe just afraid to be broken again

So let someone with a deep love to give
Give that deep love to you
And what magic you'll see

Let someone give his heart
Someone who cares like me

Let someone with a deep love to give
Give that deep love to you
And what magic you'll see

Let someone give his heart
Someone who cares like me
Someone who cares like me
