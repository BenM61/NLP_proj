Cursed to be born
Beautiful, poor and female
There's none that suffer more

She's the queen of the bees
That buzz in the bars
Fresh as a strawberry
And she always loved dancing

Cursed to be born
Beautiful, poor and female
There's none that suffer more

Two girls in two nights
Got caught in the back of the alleyway
Fresh as strawberries
Two girls in two nights
When no one came out
Zipped up their clothes
And walked back on home

Cursed to be born
Beautifil, poor and female
There's none that suffer more
