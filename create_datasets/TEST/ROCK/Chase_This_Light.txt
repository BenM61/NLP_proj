I'm a suspect, I'm a traitor
I'm only here in body visiting
Your the faces in the distant screens
The beauty is in what isn't said
I'm rising to my feet 

Because tonight the world turned on me
Because right now I don't dare breath

Oh babe I know 
It's alive 
And somewhere for us to find tonight
Chase this light with me

My just world
My last call 
My life is yours in your gifted hands
Confetti rain falls in a quiet stream
These things I found are special now
The night is in my reach

Because tonight the world turned on me
Because right now I don't dare breath

Oh babe I know 
It's alive
And somewhere for us to find tonight
Chase this light with me

And see still, photograph
Through our mothers eyes I can see
I've seen the best of love 
The best of hate
The best reward is earned and I paid
For every single word 
I've ever read

Confetti rain falls in a quiet stream
The beauty is in what you make it
So get up on your feet

Because tonight the world turned on me
Because right now I don't dare breath
