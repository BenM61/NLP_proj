Have you ever seen beyond the reach?
Have you ever felt the change?
Visions from an altered state
They conceal and relevate

Have you ever seen beyond the reach?
Have you ever felt the change?
Visions from an altered state
They conceal and relevate

Communing once again with Gods
Thread unto the impossible path
Talking with a different tongue
Heralding the unsung

Reach for them, see them turn away
Reach for them, see them turn away

Have you ever seen beyond the reach?
Have you ever felt the change?
Visions from an altered state
They conceal and relevate
Fly away, chains undone

Reach for them, see them turn away
Reach for them, see them turn away

Doors open wide
Step into the light
No turning back
Embrace the night
Breathe eternities
We're not alone
Never to return
Merge with the unknown
