My whole life is like a cardboard
A Roller coaster life - it's bound to fall
Up and down and in and out again where we're living in
Sweet kiss, take me to the moon tonight
Take a good look at what I left behind
In this place of love, and suitcase of night, and my broken pride

So I'm saying goodbye
'Cause London Bridge is falling down, falling down
And it's all right for me, all right for me
London Bridge is falling down, falling down
It's all right for me, all right for me

Tell me what you want, tell me I'm right
But don't go sneaking out in the middle of a night
I want to cradle the sun to warm this heart of mine
But I won't compromise

So I'm saying goodbye
'Cause London Bridge is falling down, falling down
And it's all right for me, all right for me
London Bridge is falling down, falling down
It's all right for me, all right for me

I don't want to know
I just want to go away from here, away
