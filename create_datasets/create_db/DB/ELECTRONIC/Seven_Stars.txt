How long it will take you to reach the stars?
No ? where you are
No one could escape it, and hold it right
No had no companion, and you were right
It's you that I want, it's you that ?
No one for the taking, it will be mine
No ? seven stars, seven stars.

Twenty seconds in counting, fifteen seconds,
Twelve, eleven, ten, eight mission ? stars
Six, five, four, three, two, one, zero.

? where you are
To know where you're going, the seven stars,
The seven stars, seven, and seven more
