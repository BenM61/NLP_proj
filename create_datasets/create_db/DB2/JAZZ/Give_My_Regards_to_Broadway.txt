Give my regards to Broadway
Remember me to Herald Square
Tell all the gang at Forty-Second Street
That I will soon be there

Whisper of how I'm yearning
To mingle with the old-time throng
Give my regards to Old Broadway
And say that I'll be there, 'ere long

Did you ever see two Yankees
Part upon a foreign shore?
When the good ship's just about to start
For Old New York once more?

With tear-dimmed eye, they say goodbye
They're friends, without a doubt
When the man on the pier shouts, "let them clear"
As the ship strikes out

Give my regards to Broadway
Remember me to Herald Square
Tell all the gang at Forty-Second Street
That I will soon be there

Whisper of how I'm yearning
To mingle with the old-time throng
Give my regards to Old Broadway
And say that I'll be there, 'ere long

Give my regards to Broadway
Remember me to Herald Square
Tell all the gang at Forty-Second Street
That I will soon be there

Whisper of how I'm yearning
To mingle with the old-time throng
Give my regards to Old Broadway
And say that I'll be there, 'ere long
