I can sit and watch it right before my eyes
I'd rather just ignore it than just act surprised
I can barely stand, I can hardly fall
Everything is so slow, everything is so small
Little sections make it to me
But I think I see everything
In a second, in a second, in a second will the world end?
I can't deny it that I'm in another place
What's all around me, all I see is just the face
Values of all the things, to me it's just a taste
Take a bite, I want to taste it
I really want to chew it up, but I can't swallow
I've been to places where you hide
I'm wondering who you are
I wanna cut you up and look inside
I think about it, think about it, never seems to come true
I can't stop the bleeding, guess the cut is misunderstood
Misunderstood
I've been to places where you hide
I'm wondering who you are
I wanna cut you up and look inside
I think about it, think about it, never seems to come true
I can't feed desire, guess the point is misunderstood
I think about it, think about it, never turns out too good
I don't get the living part, guess the world is misunderstood
I think about it, think about it, always do what I should
I never play with fire, guess the heat is misunderstood
I think about it, think about it, never turns out too good
I'm in love with fighting, I guess the pain is misunderstood
I think about it, think about it, never seems to come true
I can't stop the bleeding, I guess the cut is misunderstood
