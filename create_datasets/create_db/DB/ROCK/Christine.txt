Christine, still walking at me 
Still talking at me 
Christine, such a sense of loss 
And the baby cried 
Christine, Christine 

And the whole world dragged us down 
And the whole world turned aside 

Christine, you're in deep, pristine 
With a god-like glow 
Christine, Christine, 
Heart and the glory and me 
Chaos and the big sea 

Christine, still walking at me 
Still talking at me 
Christine, Christine, Christine 

And the whole world dragged us down 
Not a sonnet not a sound 
And the whole world turned aside 
The cruelest hand just turned an eye 

Christine
