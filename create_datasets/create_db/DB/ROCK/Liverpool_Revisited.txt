As I wake to a sunset
The light dances on the Mersey
And I think of the 96
As the tears fall down on me

There is courage, there is pride
You can see it in your eyes
Fight for justice, fight for life
There are angels in these
Skies

As the night falls around me
I see joy and devotion
These times will never leave
Like the rain on the ocean

There is dignity and pride
There is poetry and life
There are ghosts within these stones
There's defiance in these
Bones

And all the hatred they tried to throw at you
But you stayed so strong
Yeah all the hatred, it never was the truth
So keep keeping on

This is forever (woah)
We'll never leave you now
This is forever (woah)
We'll never leave you now
