Do you mind if I takes this seat right here cause you're sittin' alone

And if you gotta nigga don't lie, ain't got to front for me

You can hit me on the cell if I'm not home

Or could you be blinded by all this ice you see
I'm willing to give you all this love I got
No relationships involved
Gotta keep it strictly physical

All this love waiting just 4 you

Girl you gotta be the one, girl you gotta be the one

But I want to be that cat that makes you moan
Are you down to swing enough with me
Or could you be blinded by all this ice you see
I'm willing to give you all this love I got
No relationships involved
Gotta keep it strictly phyiscal

All this love waiting just 4 you
