Wonder if I
Should tell you not to wait
I'll ride the heat haze
Wild man take a turn
Finding out more

So many times
Longed for the break of dawn
As the morning will call
The courage waking up

Finding out more
We're finding more ways
If you need it all
We'll try to operate

Show me light
Come to the other road
Where the cold never stays
Wild man take it all

If you like to go far, run fast
But if you chase love don't pass
Chances never build to last
I better run and chase

Finding out more
Finding more ways
If you need it all
We'll try to operate

If you like to go far, run fast
But if you chase love don't pass
Chances never build to last
I better run and chase

And I will find more
Finding more ways
If I need it all
I try to operate
And I will find more
Finding more ways
And if I need it all
I try to operate
