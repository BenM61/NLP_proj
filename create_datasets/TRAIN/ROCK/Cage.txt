Do you feel warm within your cage? 
Friend, you are bigger than this 
I know you see between these lines 
Want for the world in your hands 
You are smarter than these chains 
And have you figured out yet? 
It always figures out best, life goes by
I feel something's not right 
We're living in circles 
With no break in sight yet 
Why can I not live this life? 
The way I feel 
I choose 
Know that is right 
I wanna push this wall 
Till it breaks 
It comes and it goes, it comes 
And it goes and it's never the same 
One day at a time and I can't explain why 
I keep holding on when 
I know this is all a game 
I choose to play but why? 
There's no turning back 

This prison is perfect and moving too fast 
Tell me why should I exist in life this way 
I wanna choose, know this is right 
I wanna push this wall till it breaks 
It comes and it goes, it comes 
And it goes and it's never the same 
One day at a time and I can't explain why I keep holding on when I know this is all a game 
I choose to play but why? 
Do you feel warm within your cage? 
And have you figured out yet, life goes by? 
Is that you standing head down in the line? 
Is that you with your hands held in the sign? 
The real you in this moment now 
Hoping to identify and tore-define 

And now you claim you broke free to decide 
Lonely, you built the wallsto your design 
Is that you wishing? 
You could have learned 
How to just simplify and not analyze 
Do you feel warm within your cage 
Or does it burn almost every day? 
There is still time left 
So make your decision
