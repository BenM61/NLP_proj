i look up at the sky
and see the distant lights there
and pray we all will make it through this life

there's trouble in our hearts
so much crying in the dark
and nobody's religion sets it right

tell me when you think you've had enough
tell me and we'll all just swear right now
to make it stop

you'll have a
beautiful tomorrow
a beautiful tomorrow yea
a beautiful tomorrow
if you just can stop the things

you'll do today

it's like some old cliche
that boy still cries wolf, everyday
and none will come to help him when it's time

it's me who's closed my eyes
it's just too hard to sympathize
and feel the hurt so many feel on waking everyday

you'll have a
beautiful tomorrow
a beautiful tomorrow yea
a beautiful tomorrow
if you just pretend
the world has gone away

tell me when you think you've had enough
tell me and we'll all just swear right now
to make it stop
