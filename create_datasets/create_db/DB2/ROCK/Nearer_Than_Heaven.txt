You are nearer than heaven
I get the feeling I get nearer by the day
I've seen the people go forever descending
It's when we're all inside that summer's on the way

Bullet took it easy dollar lit the room
Monsters making the evening news
Packing up a round trip, I get in the way

Now I know that
You are nearer than heaven
I get the feeling I get nearer by the day
I've seen the people go forever descending
It's when we're all inside that summer's on the way

We could talk forever nothing would get done
Stake your claim on the morning sun
I get in the way

Now I see that
You are nearer than heaven
I get the feeling I get nearer by the day
I've seen the people go forever descending
It's when we're all inside that summer's on the way

Yeah yeah
