All this time
All this changing of mind
Foolish pride and bitter denial
Way of the world, of me, and my kind
Far from grace and weak by design

And when we meet again
I will run into your arms
And when we meet again
I will fall to my knees
And rise to your needs

Beauty enslaved
Slave to the veil
Drawn to the flame
Of bitter betrayal
Way of the world, of me, and my kind
Far from grace and weak by design

And when we meet again
I will run into your arms
And when we meet again
I will fall to my knees
And rise to your needs

Say goodbye
Say my goodbyes and go
People and property
All that I know
Way of the world, of me, and my kind
Far from grace and weak by design

And when we meet again
I will run into your arms
And when we meet again
I will fall to my knees
And rise to your needs

Ain't that the way of the world?
