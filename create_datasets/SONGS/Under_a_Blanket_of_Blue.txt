Under a blanket of blue
Just you and I beneath the stars
Wrapped in the arms of sweet romance
The night is ours

Under a blanket of blue
Let me be thrilled by all your charms
Darling, I know my heart will dance
Within your arms

A summer night's magic, enthralling me so
The night would be tragic
If you weren't here to share it my dear
Covered with heaven above

Let's dream a dream of love for two
Wrapped in the arms of sweet romance
Under a blanket of blue

Under a blanket of blue
Just you and I beneath the stars
Wrapped in the arms of sweet romance
The night is ours

Under a blanket of blue
Let me be thrilled by all your charms
Darling, I know my heart will dance
Within your arms

A summer night's magic, enthralling me so
The night would be tragic
If you weren't here to share it my dear
Covered with heaven above

Let's dream a dream of love for two
Wrapped in the arms of sweet romance
Under a blanket of blue
Under a blanket of blue
