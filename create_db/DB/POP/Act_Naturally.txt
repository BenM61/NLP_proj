They're gonna put me in the movies 
They're gonna make a big star out of me 
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely 
And all I gotta do is act naturally 

[Chorus:]
Well, I'll bet you I'm a-gonna be a big star 
Might win an Oscar you can't never tell 
The movie's gonna make me a big star, 
'Cause I can play the part so well 

Well, I hope you come and see me in the movie 
Then I'll know that you will plainly see 
The biggest fool that's ever hit the big time 
And all I gotta do is act naturally 

We'll make a scene about a man that's sad and lonely 
Begging down upon his bended knee 
I'll play the part but I won't need rehearsing 
All I'll have to do is act naturally 

[Chorus]

Well, I hope you come and see me in the movie 
Then I'll know that you will plainly see 
The biggest fool that's ever hit the big time 
And all I gotta do is act naturally
