Cut off your legs, for you are too slow
I cut off my hair,I won't need it where I'm gonna go
As the nine heads bleed, over all that is mine
Kiss the mouth of the scorpion baby
'Cause Odin sayeth it's time
The sound of ringing bells, of cars smacking into trees
The sign of brother power, coming down to me

I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, not you
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, not you

Gonna cry me a river, a river of tears
Gonna crawl back in my room now, and boil up some fear
Gonna eat me a mountain, a mountain of pills
Ain't got no revolution, but I can fucking kill

I've got mine, I've got mine, I've got mine, f*ck you
I've got mine, I've got mine, I've got mine, f*ck you
