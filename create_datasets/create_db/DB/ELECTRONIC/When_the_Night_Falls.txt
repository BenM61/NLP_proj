When the night falls, oh yeah
You can tell by the way that you feel
Make the right calls, oh yeah
And just hope that she remembers you still

I'm searching for a good time
In a city where there's nobody else around
And I know it's been a little while
But your number is the only one I found

Now we've had our share of ups and downs
In the years I came through your town
But let's put it all to rest
And just have a night of one on one
When the conversation has begun
Put your head on my chest

There's something about you, girl
And it's rather strange
I wanna come back to you, girl
And make another flame

When the night falls, oh yeah
You can tell by the way that you feel
Make the right calls, oh yeah
And just hope that she remembers you still

Well you probably think I'm a fast-talking romantic
With a highfalutin' ways
But it's all about the impression you made
On the first time I met you
That stayed with me for days
And now I want that feeling back
But I'm not sure where to get it
But you have the answer to that

And you say it's nothing but fun and games
But over the phone it's not the same
So let's try to cross paths

There's something about you, girl
And it's rather strange
I wanna come back to you, girl
And make another flame

When the night falls, oh yeah
You can tell by the way that you feel
Make the right calls, oh yeah
And just hope that she remembers you still

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, yeah

When the night falls, oh yeah
You can tell by the way that you feel
Make the right calls, oh yeah
And just hope that she remembers
Hope that she remembers you still
