Did you know I was a danger
Did you know I was a threat
I might even be a killer
But they ain't pushed me that far yet

I've been branded, branded
I wear the mark of the slave on my head
Branded, branded
I know the feeling of the yoke on my neck
Branded, branded
I bear the scars of the lash on my back
Branded, branded
I've had enough and now I'm gonna fight back
Gonna fight back

Did you know I was a rebel
Yes I've always been one out
And though they tried so hard to kill me
You will always hear me shout

I've been branded, branded
I wear the mark of the slave on my head
Branded, branded
I know the feeling of the yoke on my neck
Branded, branded
I bear the scars of the lash on my back
Branded, branded
I've had enough and now I'm gonna fight back
Because I need to fight back
Yes fight back

Did you know I was a danger
Did you know I was a threat
I might even be a killer
But they ain't pushed me that far yet
Did you know I was a rebel
Yes I've always been one out
And though they tried so hard to kill me
You will always hear me shout

'Cause I've been branded, branded
I wear the mark of the slave on my head
Branded, branded
I know the feeling of the yoke on my neck
Branded, branded
I bear the scars of the lash on my back
Branded, branded
I've had enough, I'm gonna fight back

I'm gonna fight back
Yes, 'cause they branded me
They hunted me like an animal
They branded me a slave
They invaded my home
They put a yoke around my neck
They made me work they beat me
Like an animal
They made me, they made me want to kill
Just to be free
They beat me, they took away my freedom
They took away my dignity
They tried to destroy my soul by breakin' my heart
They tried to change what I believed
By breakin' my very will to live
Drove me, they hounded me
I was beaten, I was driven
I was thrown in jail for the things that I said
I got a million thoughts runnin' in my head
I got a million words, that my mouth has just got to say
I gotta speak out, I gotta speak out
I'm gonna reach out and touch your heart
Before they tear us, tear us apart
I gotta tell you about the lies
I think I know why you cry
