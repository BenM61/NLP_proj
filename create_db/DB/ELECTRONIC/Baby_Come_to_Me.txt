Silver moon shining on my bed beside my pillow
Light the pathway to bring that man to me
Oh, ooh, something tells me
My words are goin' straight to his heart
And ooh, somethin' tells me
You will be all mine

Baby, come to me, 'cause I love you
Thinkin' of you, oh
Baby, come to me, gotta have you
You got it goin' on, you turnin' me on
Baby, come to me

Know a secret how to make you want me
How to make you love me, whoa
Sure as there's a moon above
It's a friend of mine, it still makes you burn

Said, ooh, ooh, something tells me
The fire's goin' right up your spine
Whoa, ooh, somethin' tells me
You will be all mine

Baby, come to me
'Cause I love you, thinkin' of you, oh
Baby, come to me
Gotta have you, you got it goin' on, you're turnin' me on
