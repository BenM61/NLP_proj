I found ? the fingers start to twitch
The blood is set in commotion
The feet start to beat strange? on the street
Won't floods falls
The devils dive inside their minds
Everyone's a ?

The night on ? slide, ? tragic display
Silence ? and deserve, ? silence 
? inspiration, seduction ? emotion, ?

I just sing to this allergy, ? rapidly
The ? terrible ?

I will watch them dance them souls to death
I will watch them dance them souls to death
I will watch them dance them souls to death
I will watch them dance them souls to death
I will watch them dance them souls to death
I will watch them dance them souls to death.
