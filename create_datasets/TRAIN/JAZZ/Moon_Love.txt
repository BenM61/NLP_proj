Will this be moon love
Nothing but moon love
Will you be gone when the dawn comes stealing through
Are these just moon dreams
Grand while the moon beams
But when the moon fades away
Will my dreams come true
Much as I love you
Don't let me love you
If I must pay for your kiss with lonely tears
Say it's not moon love
Tell me it's true love
Say you'll be mine when the moon disappears
