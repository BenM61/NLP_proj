The girl may smile the way you do
And touch me like you too
But still she wont be you to me
The world may turn the way it does
But I wont be in love the way I am now with you
Oh it was tangled in your words
Oh but goodbye was all I heard
All I heard

And I will cry if you walk away
Wonder why if you walk away
Did I give too much too soon
What a bitter price to pay
For what are tears if you walk away
Days are years if you walk away
You will take my heart from me if you walk away

So girl if there was something wrong
You held it in too long
Cause now this fool belongs to you
Oh girl if you give me one more day
I'll find something new to say
Some sweet line to make you stay with me
Now I know you are tied up in your doubt
But don't go cause I still believe that we can work it out

And I will cry if you walk away
Wonder why if you walk away
Did I give too much too soon
What a bitter price to pay
For what are tears if you walk away
Days are years if you walk away
You will take my heart from me if you walk away

Stay baby I'll find some line to make you stay
Now I know you are tied up in your doubt
But don't go ain't too proud to beg you
Please don't leave cause I believe
We can work it out

And I will cry if you walk away
Wonder why if you walk away
Did I give too much too soon
What a bitter price to pay
For what are tears if you walk away
Days are years if you walk away
You will take my heart from me if you walk away

The girl may smile the way you do
And touch me like you too
But still she won't be you to me
