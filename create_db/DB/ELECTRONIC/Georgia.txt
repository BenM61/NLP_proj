Well, here we are again, too, too good to be friends
Forever, forever, forever
Well, look at what we've done, three, three worlds into one
Together, together, together
So, how can this be true, we, we thought that me and you
Forever, forever, forever

In a [world full of morning stark]
Rising over [unshed junk]
Dancing in the rigs of the western world
Blindfolds on but we don't care
