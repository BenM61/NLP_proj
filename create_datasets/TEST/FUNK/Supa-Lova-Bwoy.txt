Some girls they just living a lie
With a man who don't even try
Making a plan to escape, just can't wait
Fantasizing day and night

Wondering what it would be like
If the right one came along, to turn them on
Ya hav man like this and man like that,
Sum a dem slim, and some a dem fat

Some a dem cool and some a dem not
Only one cane make you hot
Supa-lovva-bwoy, that's what ya need
Kinda lover who wants ta please

Supa-lover-bwoy, understands
He can lead ya to the promised land
Supa-lova-bwoy, it's no lie
He really knows how to make you fly

Fly on, fly on
Some guys jus cramp yer style
Bore you stiff and all da while
Cheat on you when yer back is turned, never learn

Never say what they really mean
Never mean what they try to say
Always taking you for a fool, so uncool
Girls over there, girls over here

Want a guy who can take dem there
Want a man to put a smile on their face
If they don't get it, they haffa replace
Supa-lovva-bwoy, that's what ya need

Kinda lover who wants ta please
Supa-lover-bwoy, understands
He can lead ya to the promised land
Supa-lova-bwoy, It's no lie

He really knows how to make you fly
Fly on, fly on
Fly on, (fly on) fly on
It's a bird, it's a plane

It's a dream, it's a game
Be strong, have faith
It's all worth the wait
It's a light in the sky

That won't pass you by
It's a prayer, that you say
Waiting for the one
To take your breath away

Supa-lovva-bwoy, that's what ya need
Kinda lover who wants ta please
Supa-lover-bwoy, understands
He can lead ya to the promised land

Supa-lova-bwoy, It's no lie
He really knows how to make you fly
Fly on
