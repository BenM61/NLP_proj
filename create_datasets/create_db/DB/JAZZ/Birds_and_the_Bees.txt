Let me tell you 'bout the birds and the bees
And the flowers and the trees
The moon up above, and the thing called love

Let me tell you 'bout the stars in the sky
The girl and the guy
And the way they could kiss
On a night like this

When I look into your big brown eyes
It's very plain to see
That it's time you learn about the facts in life
Startin' from A to Z
Let me tell you 'bout the birds and the bees
When I look into your big brown eyes...
Well, let me tell you 'bout the birds and the bees...
Let me tell you 'bout the birds and the bees
The flowers and the trees
The stars in the sky, a girl and a guy
The birds and the bees
The flowers and the trees
The stars in the sky and a girl and a guy...
