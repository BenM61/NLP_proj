Dark red
Light years
Brought near

Cold gone
Glowing
Night sing

Star death ringing
Brought fear

I want to lie in
They call Orion
The colors missing
Upon the dark spring

Cold red
Light years
Brought near

Dark gone
Glowing 
Night sing

The worlds colliding
Unreal dividing
The colors missing
Upon the dark spring
