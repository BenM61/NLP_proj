Out in an English harbor waits an old but rugged ship 
Waiting for a crew of men so she can make her trip 
Out searching was the best gang that everyone knew well 
A-searchin' the streets & gutters so the Defiant could set sail 

The captain ordered to see the men to pick them for his crew 
Called for headstruck daughters but for all the good men too 
Out to sail this morning, Italy was her destiny 
To escort back a convoy that was helpless on the sea 

The HMS Defiant sailed to live up to her name 
There was no word of mutiny aboard, but who was there to blame? 

The Defiant reached its destiny, no timber ships in sight 
So returning home, the French approached; the Defiant had to fight 
She captured herself a vessel with a chest of jewels aboard 
Along with the Frenchmen who advised Napoleon under his sword 

With Captain Culvert wounded was there not a man to care 
The first lieutenant took command with mutiny in the air 
The breakout be with 2 men named Evans & Vazar 
Commanded the mutineers to take the ship where they desired 

The HMS Defiant sailed to live up to her name 
There was no word of mutiny aboard, but who was there to blame? 

The English were surrounded by the French who came to fight 
With love for England the mutineers turned to fight with all their might 
The Defiant walked through through fire & hell to save the Admiral Fleet 
A pardon keepin' the mutineers from making the French retreat 

(repeat & fade):
(repeat & fade):
The HMS Defiant sailed to live up to her name 
The word of mutiny now was gone & no man was to blame
