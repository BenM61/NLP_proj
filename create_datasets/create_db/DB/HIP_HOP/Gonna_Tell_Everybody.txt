[Chorus]
I don't want to say I still love you 
It hurts me everyday thinking who you were kissing, not me 
Oh na na na na na na, oh na na na na na na 
I'm going to speak the truth, I ain't gonna lie 
I let you go and for the tears I cry, thought we was going down 
Oh na na na na na na, oh na na na na na na 

Hook 
And I'm gonna tell everybody 
Cuz you cheating (gonna tell everybody) 
That you mistreat me (gonna tell everybody) 
Don't leave me (gonna tell everybody) 
So you're leaving (gonna tell everybody) 
I don't need it (gonna tell everybody) 
Don't believe it (gonna tell everybody) 
You deceived me (gonna tell everybody) 

Sitting up in my room I'm lighting candles 
Candle lit my handle thinking why 
Why did I let this situation get the best of me 
When I gave the best of me 
Its just crazy how in a minute we connect 
I was baby your lady 
Sweet city holding hands was your favorite 
Now I, I ain't got no sad song to sing 
Youse dead wrong to me 
Cuz I was thinking a minute but 
Since we separated I knew you would never find 
Find another chick like me that's why I stay up on your mind 
I know its hard for you to hear but I ain't got the time 
I moved on, I moved on, I don't want you now 

[Chorus]

And I'm gonna tell everybody 
Cuz you cheating (gonna tell everybody) 
That you mistreat me (gonna tell everybody) 
Don't leave me (gonna tell everybody) 
So you're leaving (gonna tell everybody) 
I don't need it (gonna tell everybody) 
Don't believe it (gonna tell everybody) 
You deceived me (gonna tell everybody) 

I ain't tripping I'm just saying look at what your missing out on now 
Yeah its going all out now, I'm going all out now 
And I ain't going to cry 
Grab my keys to that Bentley GT, call my girlfriends and ride 
You ain't got nothing on me (Christina's going out to party) 
You ain't got nothing on me 
You ain't got nothing on me 
Really this thing ain't nothing 
You ain't got nothing on me (run and go and tell everybody) 
You ain't got nothing on me 
You ain't got nothing on me 
Really this thing ain't nothing 

[Chorus]
