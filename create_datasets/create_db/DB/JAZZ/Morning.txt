What of a morning
That brings a day so gently
And bathes the leaves
Of memories
That fell so long ago

I still recall you
In all these early hours
Though I were there
Once more to share
A love lost long ago

Crassness of youth
Concluding only half of the truth
Exuding only one small percent
Of what I surely felt for you

And then one morning
That brought a day so gently
We set apart
Things of the heart
And lost love long ago
