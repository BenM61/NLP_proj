Born on the wrong side of time
Even your best friend
Is ready to watch you die

You don't want to live on the street
So you've got to sweat till you're dead
To make ends meet

Born on the wrong side of time
Your days are so cold
That you curse just something to cry

That you should be living in fear
When you cry out
Your friends just don't want to hear

And you dream of the day
When the great mastertime
Will call us to his side

And you watch your brothers
Shake with fear as they watch
His serpentine eye

And you can smell their fear
As they stand and curse
The fact that they're alive

Born on the wrong side of time
Pretend to yourself
That some day you'll do just fine

You know that you live through a lie
You'll only find out what went wrong
When the sun makes us cry
