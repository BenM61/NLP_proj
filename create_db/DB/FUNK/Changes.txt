I feel unhappy
I feel so sad
I lost the best friend
That I ever had

She was my woman
I loved her so
But it's too late now
I've let her go

I'm going through changes
I'm going through Changes (in my life)

We shared the years
We shared each day
In love together
We found a way

But soon the world
Had its evil way

My heart was blinded
Love went astray

I'm going through changes
I'm going through Changes (in my life)

It took so long
To realize
That I can still hear her
Last goodbyes
Now all my days
Are filled with tears
Wish I could go back
And change these years

I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes, 
In my life, in my life,
There gotta be a change in my life
This little changes, in my life
