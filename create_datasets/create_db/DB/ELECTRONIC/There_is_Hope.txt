There is hope in this life
There is fear in these eyes
And I believe we can fly
Through the hole in the sky

There is hope in this life
There is fear in these eyes
And I believe we can fly
Through the hole in the sky

There is hope
There is fear
And I believe
We can fly

There is hope
There is fear
And I believe
We can fly

There is hope in this life
There is fear in these eyes
And I believe we can fly
Through the hole in the sky

There is hope in this life
There is fear in these eyes
And I believe we can fly
Through the hole in the sky

There is hope in this life
There is fear in these eyes
And I believe we can fly
Through the hole in the sky

There is hope
There is fear
And I believe
We can fly

There is hope
There is fear
And I believe
We can fly

There is hope in this life
There is fear in these eyes
And I believe we can fly
Through the hole in the sky

There is hope in this life
There is fear in these eyes
And I believe we can fly
Through the hole in the sky
