Papa sings a Christmas song
And it's so sweet that nana sings along
The music notes fall from the sky
It's baby's first Christmas lullaby

The angels smile and spread their wings
And if you listen you can hear them sing
And through the room reindeers dance and fly
That's baby's first Christmas lullaby

Charlotte wakes when she hears the croons
Of candy canes and singing spoons
Hush, Amanda, now don't you weep
Your dolls will sing you back to sleep
Then
Santa comes with Rudolph too
And here's a special gift they bring to you
And you can sing it if you try
That's baby's first Christmas lullaby

The Christmas tree begins to sway
And all the toy balloons just seem to say
Don't let the music pass you by
It's baby's first Christmas lullaby
Then
Tweedle dumb and tweedle dee
Are harmonizing 'neath the tree
The mistletoes let out a sigh
They're telling you, you must not cry
So
Join with me in this Christmas song
And you'll feel good if you can sing along
So sing it loud and don't be shy
That's baby's first Christmas lullaby
