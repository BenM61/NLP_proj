Love is a flame
I just got burned again
You're always there
Each time I need a friend

Cool love, cool love
I don't why I didn't never see
The one who was always right there for me
Could it be you and I
Should we give it a try 
I only know
That I'm never gonna let you down
No, I'm never gonna let you down
Cool love

It feels so right being here with you
Just two old friends but now there's something new
So easy to talk
Just taking a walk 
With the one I love
And I'm never gonna let you down
No, I'm never gonna let you down
Cool love

I was so lost
Needed more than a friend
Love was right there
You saved me again
And I'm never gonna let you down
Cool love

Love was so close, finally it came to me
