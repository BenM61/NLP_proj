Launch procedure commence
Countdown start
Ten, nine
Eight, seven
Six, five, four

Keep goin'

(Acceleration into temporal space continuum now begins)

Thirty thousand feet and still-a-counting (live for love)
The attack on my plane is steadily mounting (live for love)
They killed my buddy but I'm supposed to feel nothing (live for love)

How can I live for love?
I'm calling (Live for love)
(Live for love)
I'm calling (live for love)
I'm calling (live for love)

Kicked out of my home at seventeen (live for love) (get outta here!)
A real family, now what does that, now what does that mean? (live for love)
Don't nobody know the trouble I've seen? (live for love)

How can I live for love?
I'm calling (Live for love)
(Live for love)
(Live for love)
(Live for love)

My mission, so they said, was just to drop the bombs
(Acceleration into temporal space continuum now begins)
Just like I got no conscience
Just like I got no qualms (Alpha Seven, acknowledge)
Now what does that mean?

Go, Tommy go, go, Tommy, go
Go, Tommy go, go, Tommy, go
Go, Tommy go, go, Tommy, go
Go, Tommy go, go, Tommy, go

So here, my target is approaching
The angel on my shoulder starts coaching

Live for love, without love you don't live

Boom, I take a deep breath
Is it boom, life, is it boom, death?

Live for love

Maybe I was better off staying in school (live for love)
But everybody said flying planes was cool (live for love)
It's so easy for them to say, 'cause they never have to go through

How can I live for love?
(Live for love) I'm calling! (Live for love)
I'm calling! (live for love)
Aah, I'm coming! (live for love)
(Live for love)
(Live for love)
(Live for love)

Damn, I got hit, but I still complete the mission (live for love)
I flash upon my whole life just-a-steady wishin' (live for love)
The choice you make is vital, so end of my recital
I say, you got to live for love (live for love)
(Live for love)
(Live for love)
(Live for love)
(Live for love)
(Live for love)
(Live) (live for love)

Live for love, without love you don't live
And how you make it is based on what you're givin' back
In fact, only a few of us slip through the cracks
Through generations
The cards have always been stacked against us (live for love)
To love each other is a must
If we just trust and cut the fuss
Believe me, unity is a must
Listen everybody, as I spread the word
Everything is hazy when your vision's blurred
I'm kickin' reality in the streets of the city
There's this mentality what goes around comes around
And 'gangking' any clown who ain't down
With the colors that you're sportin' 'round
Listen G, you are supposed to be
Strivin' to be the best that you can be
So stop tryin' to dominate and push and shove (live for love)
Come on y'all
We got to live for love (live for love)

(Live for love)
(Live for love)
(Live for love)

(Live for love)
(Live for love)
(Live for love)
