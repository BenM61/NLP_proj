The Dr. Frankenstein, with all the things you've brought to life
Tell me, are you satisfied, or are you happy now?
Dr. Frankenstein
There's innocence in every crime
Some in yours and some in mine
But it shouldn't be allowed

'Cause it's not where you go when you die
It's how you live when you're alive
Who you touch and how you feel it?
It's not about the time that you have
It's how you cry and how you laugh
Who you love and how you mean it
And do you mean it?

Dr. Frankenstein, did they think you've wasted all this time
On making monsters in your mind?
Well, I hope they make you proud

'Cause it's not where you go when you die
It's how you live when you're alive
Who you touch and how you feel it?
It's not about the time that you have
It's how you cry and how you laugh
Who you love and how you mean it
And do you mean it?

It's not where you go when you die
It's how you live when you're alive
Who you touch and how you feel it?
It's not about the time that you have
It's how you cry and how you laugh
Who you love and how you mean it
No, no, no

It's not where you go when you die
It's how you live when you're alive
Who you touch and how you feel it?
It's not about the time that you have
It's how you cry and how you laugh
Who you love and how you mean it
And do you mean it?
