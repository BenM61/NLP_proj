While the king and queen lie sleeping 
And their daughters smile so nice
Brothers wait through windows 
And the peasants die for rice
And here I'm standing naked 
Laughing madly at the sun 
Though I wanted to sleep late today 
The Battle's just begun 

Oh, the Devil in all his wisdom 
The father in all his grace 
The servant's sons are washed in blood 
And the man has run his race 

A moving target looms behind the street where soldiers stood 
Siren screams out desperately 
Like only humans could 
And standing on my balcony 
I watch the battle run 
Yes the war is never over 
But the day is never done 

Oh, the Devil in all his wisdom 
The father in all his grace 
The servant's sons are washed in blood 
And the man has run his race 
 
Six-white horses like the wind are running 
Five are far behind 
The captain lost his daughter 
The sergeant lost his mind 
The soldiers they still scream for riches 
Even though they swore 
That sons and daughters wouldn't live 
Unless we won the war

Oh, the Devil in all his wisdom 
The father in all his grace 
The servant's sons are washed in blood 
And the man has run his race
