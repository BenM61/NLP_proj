Are these 2 moons or your eyes?
My heart asks about you
You see me thinking about you
Maybe I am in love
I swear this was not on my mind
Oh love
From the love
Oh love
It is filling my nights
Oh my life
All my life
I have given myself to her
And her eyes have told me something
I am becoming infatuated with you my precious
And me
What has happened to me?
That I now melt in your love
Why is it you whom I love?
How and when did you make me
So infatuated with you?
