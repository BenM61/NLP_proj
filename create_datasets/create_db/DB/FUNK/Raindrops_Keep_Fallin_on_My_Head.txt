Raindrops keep falling on my head
And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed
Nothin' seems to fit
Those raindrops are falling on my head, they keep falling

So I just did me some talkin' to the sun
And I said I didn't like the way he got things done
Sleepin' on the job, oh
Raindrops are falling on my head, they keep falling

But there's one thing I know
The blues they send to meet me, won't defeat me
It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me

Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red
Crying's not for me, oh
I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'

Because I'm free
Nothing's worrying me

It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me

Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red
Crying's not for me, oh
I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'

Because I'm free
Nothing's worrying me
