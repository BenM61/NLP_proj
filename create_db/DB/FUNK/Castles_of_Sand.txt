Why do we build this castle of sand
When we know very well baby, it will never stand

I tried to cope, I really hoped that you would see
You were the only girl for me baby
I tried to mend but you condemned a love affair
You destroyed it beyond repair

You absorb the talk of a friend baby
She said project the harder stalk and never bend
And be free from me and the things I do
Can't you see she's trying to take me from you

Why do we build this castle of sand
When we know very well baby, it will never stand
Why do we build this castle of sand
When we know very well baby, it will never stand

The mental strain in my brain to great a price to pay
For the way you make me feel in bed, baby
And all our plans these grains of sand,
The waves have washed away, the book that I misread

You don't equate sex with love
But isn't the love we make worthy of
More than wishful thoughts and plastic smiles
And ecstasy that only last for a while

Why do we build this castle of sand
When we know very well baby, it will never stand
Why do we build this castle of sand
When we know very well baby, it will never stand

Why do we build this castle of sand
When we know very well baby, it will never stand
Why do we build this castle of sand
When we know very well baby, it will never stand
