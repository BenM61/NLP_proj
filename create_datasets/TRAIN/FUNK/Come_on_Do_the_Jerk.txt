Come on do the jerk (come on do the jerk)
Come on do the jerk (come on do the jerk)
Everybody now gather around
Get hip to the new sensation
There's a brand new dance coming to your town
And sweeping across the nation
Come on do the jerk everybody (come on do the jerk)

I said, come on do the jerk everybody (come on do the jerk)
Now snap your back like a bullwhip crack
Now jerk your hip, let your backbone slip
You've done the monkey, you've done the twist
And the mashed potatoes too

The swim and the fly have all gone by
There's a brand new dance for you
Come on do the jerk everybody (come on do the jerk)
I said, come on do the jerk right now (come on do the jerk)

You've got to bob and weave
Come on bob and weave
And when you do
Let your neck snap too
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's alright

Well now jerk children jerk (jerk children jerk)
Come on jerk children jerk (jerk children jerk)
Well now jerk children jerk (jerk children jerk)
Well jerk children jerk (jerk children jerk)
Well now jerk to the left and jerk to the right

Jerk all day and jerk all night
Jerk it hard and jerk it soft
Jerk your hands and arms right off

Come on do the jerk in the morning (come on do the jerk)
Come on do the jerk right now (come on do the jerk)
Now snap your bac (now snap your back) like a bullwhip crack
Now jerk your hip (now jerk your hip), let your backbone slip (let your back bone slip)

Come on do the jerk right now (come on do the jerk)
Everybody come on do the jerk right now (come on do the jerk)
Jerk children jerk (jerk children jerk)
