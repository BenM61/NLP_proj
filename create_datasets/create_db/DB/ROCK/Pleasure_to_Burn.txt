I'm the million miles on your life
I'm the train wreck waiting that you'll never survive
I'm the hate, I'm the love
I've got the blood of a man that will take you

The dirty thought on your woman's mind
Is the man I am taking over your pride
I'm the hate, I'm the love
I've got the blood of a man that will break you

You thought you felt it all once before
I'll crawl right in
Under your skin
To do you in

And you're a pleasure to burn
I'm twitching skin
Bones break again
The rush sets in

And you're a pleasure to burn
I'm the blade on you're filthy skin
I'm the reason the reason you want it to end
I'm the hate, I'm the love

I've got the blood of a man that will take you
I'm the high that you'll never find
I'm the vein you stick just to get by
I'm the hate, I'm the love

I've got the blood of a man that will break you
I would love to call you a friend
I would love to beat you again
I am your demon inside
I am your favorite lie

Now I cannot be replaced
Now that I have found my place
