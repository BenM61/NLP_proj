I've crossed deserts for miles 
Swam water for time 
Searching places to find 
A piece of something to call mine (I'm coming) 
A piece of something to call mine (I'm coming)
Coming closer to you 

Ran along many moors 
Walked through many doors 
The place where I want to be 
Is the place I can call mine (I'm coming) 
Is the place I can call mine (I'm coming)
Coming closer to you 

I'm moving, I'm coming 
Can you hear what I hear 
It's calling you, my dear 
Out of reach (Take me to my beach) 
I can hear it calling you 
I'm coming, not drowning 
Swimming closer to you 

Never been here before 
I'm intrigued, I'm unsure
I'm searching for more 
I've got something that's all mine 
I've got something that's all mine 

Take me somewhere I can breathe 
I've got so much to see 
This is where I want to be 
In a place I can call mine 
In a place I can call mine 

I'm moving, I'm coming 
Can you hear what I hear 
It's calling you, my dear 
Out of reach (Take me to my beach) 
I can hear it calling you 
I'm coming, not drowning 
Swimming closer to you 

Moving, coming 
Can you hear what I hear? (Hear it out of reach) 
I hear it calling you 
Swimming closer to you 

Many faces I have seen 
Many places I have been 
Walked the deserts, swam the shores (Coming closer to you) 
Many faces I have known 
Many ways in which I've grown 
Moving closer on my own (Coming closer to you) 

I move it, I feel it 
I'm coming, not drowning 
I move it, I feel it 
I'm coming, not drowning 

I'm moving, I'm coming 
Can you hear what I hear 
It's calling you, my dear 
Out of reach (Take me to my beach) 
I can hear it calling you 
I'm coming, not drowning 
Swimming closer to you (Take me to my beach) 

I'm moving, I'm coming 
Can you hear what I hear 
It's calling you, my dear 
Out of reach (Take me to my beach) 
I can hear it calling you 
I'm coming, not drowning 
Swimming closer to you 
(Take me to my beach)

I'm moving, I'm coming 
Can you hear what I hear 
It's calling you, my dear 
Out of reach (Take me to my beach) 
I can hear it calling you
