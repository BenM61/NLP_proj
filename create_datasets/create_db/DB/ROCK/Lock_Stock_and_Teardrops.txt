Someday I won't come runnin'
When you call
The way you hurt me
It's a wonder I'm still here at all

Someday you'll wake up
And you'll find yourself alone
Lock, stock and teardrops
I'll be gone

I can't go on
The way you make me feel
You make me cry
And every time expect me to forgive

Someday you'll wake up
To a cold and lonely dawn
Lock, stock and teardrops
I'll be gone

Oh someday I'll wake up
And find the strength to carry on
And lock, stock and teardrops
I'll be gone

Lock, stock and teardrops
Lock, stock and teardrops
Lock, stock and teardrops
I'll be gone
