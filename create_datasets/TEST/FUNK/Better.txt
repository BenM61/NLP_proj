Love to see you shine in the night like the diamond you are
(Love to see you shine in the night like the diamond you are)
I'm on the other side, it's alright, just hold me in the dark
(I'm on the other side, it's alright, just hold me in the dark)
No one's got to know what we do, hit me up when you're bored
(No one's got to know) Nah (what we do, hit me up when you're bored)
'Cause I live down the street, so we meet when you need it, it's yours
All I hear is

Nothin' feels better than this
Nothin' feels better
Nothin' feels better than this
Nothin' feels better, no, no
We don't gotta hide
This is what you like, got it made
Nothin' feels better than this

You say we're just friends but I swear when nobody's around
(You say we're just friends but I swear when nobody's around)
You keep my hand around your neck, we connect, are you feeling it now?
(Keep my hand around your neck) 'Cause I am (we connect, are you feeling it now?)
I got so high the other night, I swear to God, I felt my feet leave the ground
(I got so high the other night, I swear to God) Ooh yeah (felt my feet leave the ground)
Your back against the wall, this is all we've been talkin' about
In my ears

Nothin' feels better than this (no, no, no)
Nothin' feels better
Nothin' feels better than this
Nothin' feels better, no, no
We don't got to hide
This is what you like, got it made
Nothin' feels better than this

Go left, right, left, like
Take you back when you're side to side
Like that, like that, ayy
No left, right, left, like
Take you back when you're side to side
Like

Nothin' feels better than this
Nothin' feels better
Nothin' feels better than this
(Nothin' feels better) Oh, no, no
(We don't got to hide) Hide
(This is what you like) Ooh (got it made)
Nothin' feels better than this, ooh
(Better than this)

(Nothin' feels better than this, oh yeah)
(Nothin' feels better, nothin' feels better)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
