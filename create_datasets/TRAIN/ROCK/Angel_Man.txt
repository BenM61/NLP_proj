Take the girls 
Take the money 
'cause you want to survive 
It's a hard world 
With hard people 
And it's nothing but heartache

Angel man 
Are you in love with one girl 
Oh angel 
You fight for respect 
But you can't take on 
The whole world

Diamond rough 
Are you a child of the devil 
Oh angel 
There's no stopping you now 
There's no turning back 
Angel man

A man of means 
With the Midas touch 
Everybody's searcing 
'cause they all want as much 
In this hard world 
With hard poeple 
And it's nothing but heartache

Angel man 
Are you in love with one girl 
Oh angel angel 
There's no stopping you now 
There's no turning back 
Angel man 
Angel man 
Angel man 
Oh angel

You're the last of the angry young men 
The only man who has all the power 
And the glory 
Who cares nothing 
For no-one

Angel man 
Are you in love with one girl 
Oh angel 
You fight for respect 
But you can't take on 
The whole world

Diamond rough 
Are you a child of the devil 
Oh angel angel 
There's no stopping you now 
There's no turning back 
Angel man 
Angel man 
You're the last of the angry young men 
Such aggression 
You fight for respect 
But you can't take on the whole world 
Angel man
