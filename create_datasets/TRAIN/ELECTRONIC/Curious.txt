Tumbling dice, seven on 'em, baby
Yeah, come on, yeah
LSG, LSG

When I rise in the morning and face the sunlight
You bounce all my love and it's air tight
Sometimes I'm curious on how you feel
When you're screaming out my name

Is it really for reality, originality, my mentality
Explore every possibility, let's get down
Shorty time will reveal the only true test is pain
You know the deal

Love appears like bright lights in the night sky
Disappears in the blink of a teary eye
That's why I'm C, caught up in your love
U are incredible, your love is a drug

R you the one that can hold me down
I don't know but O I like the sound
U are amazing, there's no doubt
Top it off with a S 'cause you smooth me out

So get ready and let me love you
I got the answer right here beside me, girl
Love is a gamble, I wanna take with you
So let me win girl, I wanna know what's on your mind

I'm curious
(About your lovin')
I'm curious
(I wanna know what's on your mind, baby)
I'm curious
(About your lovin', girl)
I'm curious
(I wanna know what's on your mind, baby)

Hey yo, I'm so serious, your whole package baby
Lookin' so rambunctious, got me wide open to golf
I'm really anxious to get familiar, get in your subconscious
And discuss the many different various
Issues that affiliate the best of both of us
Word the mother and as we ride up on the Bus
Conversation is making the whole situation a plus

Just figure it out, is we dealing wit us?
Or do we capture that feeling that makes you curious
About whether or not we minimize the fuss
Just to move on, you must trust in Bussa Bus
And from the bus, my horse carriages carry us
Singin' Sarafina, a little ghetto fabulous, fabulous

Lovely lady, here's my attention
I've gotta have you right here beside me
Love is a gamble, I wanna take with you
I wanna win girl, so let me know what's on your mind

I'm curious
(About your lovin')
I'm curious
(I wanna know what's on your mind)
I'm curious
(About your lovin')
I'm curious
(I wanna know what's on your mind, baby)

I, I, I, I, oh, I

Curiosity killed the cat, satisfaction brought it back
So how you likin' that while you're digging on me?
I'm digging on your moves but I'm curious daddy
Can you show and prove?
'Cus I wanna feel more than ever what you got

The smell of your cool water makes me hot
Run, dada, he knows the G-spot
And wear me or go dime and forget you're not
Ya, see the way that you be leaves me intrigued
And I do believe tonight you're feelin' me
We can make music easily
And I'd readily give you the best of me, see

What's on your mind, baby?
(I wanna know what's on your mind)
What's on your mind?

So get ready for my love tonight
I'm gonna make you feel
I'm gonna make you feel alright

I'm curious
(About your lovin', girl)
I'm curious
(I wanna know what's on your mind)
I'm curious
(About your lovin', girl)
I'm curious
(Wanna know what's on your mind)

I'm curious
(Never hurt nobody, I like the loving girl)
I'm curious
(I wanna know what's on your mind)
I'm curious
(Never hurt nobody)
