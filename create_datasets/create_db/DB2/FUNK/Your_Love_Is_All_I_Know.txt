In my mind
I only see your face
And time will not erase
What I feel for you, feel for you

In my heart
It was always you and me
That's how I thought it would be
Forever and ever

Where do I go
What do I do 
After all that we've been through

How do I turn around
Just turn around and watch you go
'Cause baby your love is all I know

The touch of your hand
The warmth of your embrace
I always had a place here in your arms
I felt so secure I didn't need anything more

Where do I go
What do I do
After all that we've been through

How do I turn around
Just turn around and watch you go 
(?) Did you baby, 'cause baby your love is all I know

Tell me how
Can you walk away and find somebody new, 
When I can't see myself with anyone but you

Where do I go
What do I do
After all that we've been through
How do I turn around
Just turn around and watch you go 
'Cause baby your love is all I know
Baby, baby, baby your love is all 
Baby, your love is all I know
