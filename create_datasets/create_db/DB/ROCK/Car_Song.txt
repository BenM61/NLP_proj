You could call me a car lover
'Cause I love it in a motor
And the way it feels
To ride around on new wheels.

I hardly know you
But I think I'm going to
Let's go siesta
In your Ford Fiesta

Here we go again
I'm riding in your car
Let me count to ten
'Cause it's gone way too far
Up my street to nowhere
You know what detours are
Here we go again
And it's gone way too far

Sometimes I just can't function
My heart's spaghetti junction
Every shining bonnet
Makes me think of my back on it.

I just can't escape the feeling
That I'd rather be free wheeling
In every little Honda
There may lurk a Peter Fonda, ho

Here we go again
I'm riding in your car
Let me count to ten
'Cause it's gone way too far
Up my street to nowhere
You know what detours are
Here we go again
And it's gone way too far
