I'm living with a guilty secret deep in my heart,
Living in a guilty secret life;

We meet at night, we stay out late,
And we avoid the man who makes her life so bad,
'Cause he doesn't want her the way that I want her,
He doesn't need her the way I do;

The phone is hot with whispered words,
And when we can't speak we have textual delight,
'Cause he doesn't need her the way that I need her,
He doesn't love her the way I do;

We're living with a guilty secret deep in our hearts,
Living in a guilty secret life,
And anytime I want to see her just have to dream;

I love her

Oh it's alright, 'cause we've got time,
A good thing's worth waiting for,
And it's my life and I can say that she's mine, mine, mine;

There was a time he was my friend,
But now the way he treats that woman is the end,
And she doesn't love him the way that she loves me,
She doesn't want him anymore;

We're living with a guilty secret deep in our hearts,
Living in a guilty secret life,
And anytime I want to see her just have to dream;

I love her
I really love her

Oh it's alright, 'cause we've got time,
A good thing's worth waiting for,
And it's my life, and nobody knows that she's mine, mine, mine;

We're living with a guilty secret deep in our hearts,
Living in a guilty secret life,
Living with a guilty secret deep in our hearts,
Living in a guilty secret life,
Living with a guilty secret deep in our hearts,
Living in a guilty secret life;

We meet at night, guilty secret,
We stay out late, guilty secret,
The phone is hot, guilty secret,
Whispered words, guilty secret,
Hmmm living with a guilty secret deep in our hearts,
Living in a guilty secret life.
