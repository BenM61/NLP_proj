Don't you hear the music, baby? 
It's only feel-good (baby) 
Let it get to you, baby 
Try and let go 
You don't have to worry about a thing 
Just come on up, come on up 
Just come on up, baby and have a good time 
Love to watch it happen, baby 
When I dance with you (baby) 
Love to see the music take you 
Right up to the mornin' 
You don't have to worry about a thing 
Come on up, just come on up 
Just come on up, baby and have a good time 
Come on now, give it a try! 

(Instrumental)

Start it nice and easy, baby 
Take it real slow (baby) 
Just let it take you, baby 
Where you want to go (baby) 
Come on with me, baby 
Don't let me go alone (baby) 
Keep on pushin', baby 
Until we get home (baby) 
It's only feel-good 
It's only feel-good 
You know, I just can't stop 
I just can't stop (baby)
