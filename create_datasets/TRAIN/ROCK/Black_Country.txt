It's cold on the mountain
Its cold in the wood
My life is a fountain
It's all in my blood

I go down to the river
I'll never sleep till I'm gone
Its cold on the mountain
I could not leave you alone

I am a messenger
This is my prophecy
I'm goin' back
To the Black Country

I speak for the million
From city to shire
We come from the heartland
We walk through the fire

We rise to the measure
The line in the sand
Its cold on the mountain
And this is our land

I am a messenger
This is my prophecy
I'm goin' back
To the Black Country
