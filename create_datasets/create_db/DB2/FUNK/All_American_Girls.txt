We're all American girls
And we love the life that we lead.
We're all American girls -
Hear what we say
know what we mean.
We're all American girls...

The day has finally come

We're reaching out for number one.
We've worked hard all of our lives

It was a fight just to survive.
You'd better get this straight

Wise up before it's too late.
We're not threatened by your lies
Oryourgoodbyes.
We're all American girls...

Sometimes the struggle gets rough

You give your all
but it's not enough.
A vacant job at the top

Don't let them tell you that right you're not.
We're not asking to reverse roles so long rehearsed.
Give us an equal share - that's just faire.
We're all American girls...
