I did my best but I guess my best wasn't good enough
'Cause here we are back where we were before
Seems nothing ever changes, we're back to being strangers
Wondering if we oughta stay or head on out the door

Just once, can't we figure out what we keep doing wrong
Why we never last for very long
What are we doing wrong
Just once, can't we find a way to finally make it right
Make the magic last for more than just one night
If we could just get to it, I know we could break through it

I gave my all but I think my all may have been too much
'Cause Lord knows we're not getting anywhere
Seems we're always blowing whatever we got going
And it seems at times with all we've got we haven't got a prayer

Just once, can't we figure out what we keep doing wrong
Why the good times never last for long
Where're we going wrong
Just once, can't we find a way to finally make it right
Make the magic last for more than just one night
I know we could break through it, if we could just get to it

Just once, I want to understand
Why it always come back to good-bye
Why can't we get ourselves in hand and admit to one another
We're no good with out the other
Take the best and make it better
Find a way to stay together

Just once can't we find a way to finally make it right
Make the magic last for more than just one night
I know we could break through it, if we could just get to it
Just once
I know we can get through it
Just once
