Mother teach me to walk again 
Milk and honey so intoxicating 

[Chorus]
And into the fire 
I'm reunited 
Into the fire 
I am the spark 
Into the night 
I yearn for comfort 

Open the doors that lead on into Eden 
Don't you disguise
I'll follow the signs marked back to the beginning 
No more compromise 

[Chorus]

Free the water that carries me to the sea 
You I see as my security 

Into the fire 
I'm reunited 
Into the fire 
Oh, I am the spark 
Into the night 
I yearn for comfort 

I will stare into the sun until its light doesn't blind me 
I will walk unto the fire until its heat doesn't burn me 
And I will feed the fire 

[Chorus]

Into the fire
Into the fire
Into the fire 
I'm reunited 
Into the fire 
Oh, I am the spark 
Into the night 
I yearn for comfort 
Into the fire
Into the fire
Into the fire
I'm reunited
Into the fire
I am the spark
Into the night
I yearn for comfort
