I've been looking for you all year long
Just to tell me I have not been wrong
Is this all that you can give me back?
Come on, woman, you'll have to do less than that

And now I see that waking everyday
Always leads straight to feeling this way
And if you have no more to say than that
Oh well, I'll be leaving and I won't come back

I'd give you all I have
If I could get it back
This has been the best of me
I hope you end up missing me
And I'll hold on to that 
And I'll hold on to that
And I'll hold on to that

Is the water dragging at your feet
Urging you to slip down underneath
Are you gonna let me take your soul
My god, you lead me on, I'm gonna eat you whole

You son of a bitch,
Stop writing songs like this
You think you're better than them
But they don't have to pretend

I give you all I have
If I could get it back
This has been the best of me
I hope you end up missing me
And I'll hold on to that 
And I'll hold on to that
And I'll hold on to that
And I'll hold on to that
And I'll hold on to that
