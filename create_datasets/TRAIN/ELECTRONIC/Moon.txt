As the lukewarm hands of the Gods
Came down and gently picked my adrenaline pearls
They placed them in their mouths
And rinsed all of the fear out
Nourished them with their saliva

ooh rested, as if the healthiest past-time
Is being in life-threatening circumstances
And once again be reborn

(All birthed and happy)
All birthed and happy
(All birthed and happy)
All birthed and happy

Best way to start the new is to fail miserably
Fail at loving and fail at giving
Fail at creating a flow then realign the whole
And kick into the start hole

And kick into the start hole
And kick into the start hole

To risk all is the end all and the beginning all
To risk all is the end all and the beginning all
