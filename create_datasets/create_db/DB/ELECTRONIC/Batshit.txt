Oh, you're bad enough to me
Bad enough that we always have something to get over
Oh, you dress up so happy
Lookin' so fancy
I got that salted chip on my shoulder
Oh, but when the night is deep
You find me in the streets
Asking me to come over

Batshit, batshit
Batshit
I'm batshit crazy

I'm batshit crazy
Batshit, batshit
Batshit
I'm batshit crazy
Batshit, batshit
Batshit

Oh, but when the night is deep
You find me in the streets
Asking me to come over

I'm batshit crazy

Batshit, batshit, batshit, batshit crazy
Batshit, batshit, batshit, batshit crazy
Batshit, batshit, batshit, batshit crazy
Batshit, batshit, batshit, batshit crazy
Batshit, batshit, batshit, batshit crazy

Oh, you're bad enough to me
Bad enough that we always have something to get over
Oh, you dress up so happy
Looking so fancy

Oh, but when the night is deep
You find me in the streets
Asking me to come over

Batshit, batshit
Batshit
