(There's a bluebird)

There's a bluebird

(There's a rainbow)

There's a bluebird on your windowsill
There's a rainbow in your sky
There are happy thoughts, your heart to fill
Near enough to make you cry

(There's a bluebird)

There he is.

(There's a rainbow)

And with every tear you've washed away
All the things you've kept inside
You count your joys this lovely day
And you wonder why you cried

There's a bluebird on your windowsill
There's a rainbow in your sky
There are happy thoughts, your heart to fill
Near enough to make you cry

(There's a bluebird)

Look at him out there, ain't he pretty

(There's a rainbow)

And if perchance your heart grow sad
You still can smile again
And with every tear you've ever had
Comes the sunshine after rain

There's a bluebird

(Yes, yes)

There's a rainbow

(Hear, hear.)

(Orchestral Break)

The rainy days may come and go
But the clouds soon roll away
Everything will come that you wish it so
As an answer when you pray.

There's a bluebird on your windowsill
There's a rainbow in your sky
There're happy thoughts, your heart to fill
Near enough to make you cry

(There's a bluebird)

Cutest feathers.

(There's a rainbow)

Lovely weather.

(There's a bluebird)

Look at that bluebird and the rainbow in the sky.
