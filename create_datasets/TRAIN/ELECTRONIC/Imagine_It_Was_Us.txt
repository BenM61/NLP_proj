I should know better than to wait for you
If I leave, well it's no better, so I'll wait for you
I don't know if this is wrong, but it's crept into my mind
I don't know if this is love, but I think it's worth a try

Could it be a deep fantasy?
Could it be a secret to keep?

Are you waiting for something? (Imagine it was us)
Tell me, would you wait all night?
Are you thinking about it like I do, I do?
I would wait all night
(I would wait all night)
(I would wait all night)

There must be a reason why it has to be you
You and me, we need to make it, so it's just us two
I don't know if this is wrong, but it's crept into my mind
I don't know if this is love, but I think it's worth a try

Could it be a deep fantasy?
Could it be a secret to keep?

Are you waiting for something?
Tell me, would you wait all night?
Are you thinking about it like I do, I do?
I would wait all night

Are you waiting for something? (Imagine it was us)
Tell me, would you wait all night?
Are you thinking about it like I do, I do?
I would wait all night

If it takes all night
If it takes all night
If it takes all night for me
If it takes all night for me
