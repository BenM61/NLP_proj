I stayed up all night
Waiting for you to call
But something ain't right
Night after night

I get lonely
It's been awhile
Since I've seen that look in your eyes
Now that you're gone

I can't go on
Without you
Deep inside my heart
I had a feelin' right from the start

You didn't love me
Deep inside my heart
I had a feelin' you tore apart
You didn't want me

Like I wanted you
I turned out the light
I tossed and I turned until dawn
I couldn't sleep

And just couldn't keep
From cryin'
I'll never learn
Whatever I do I get burned

You went away
Now I face the day
Without you
