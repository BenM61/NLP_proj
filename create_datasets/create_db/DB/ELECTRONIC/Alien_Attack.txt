Think of old geology 
It is but a theory 
What about reality 
Nobody was there to see 
So lets go back in time 

60 million years ago 
Another race, superior to our 
Foresaw the catastrophe 
Fled to space and fled the tragedy 
Now they're here again with a simple claim 
Alien attack 
They want their planet back 
No matter what we say 
Extermination is their way 
We will never stand a chance 
To them we are no more than ants 
But I want to say, we'll fight them anyway 
Alien attack 
They want their planet back
