I've got a mild fascination for collectors
Where'd you find all that time,
A place for everything in the house?

Your girlfriend says it's time to sell,
But everything it fits so well.
Rosewood from '75
That Seaboard reciever lost an eye.
One shrunken head from Africa,
Your girlfriend says you better not.
You don't believe in superstition, 
You find the lord in repetition.

Where'd you find all that time,
A place for everything in the house?
I've got a mild fascination for collectors.

A peice of wood from Noah's Ark,
A thing collected from the start.
And if there is another flood,
Your house will float on Noah's wood.
