I'm at work, I don't feel like working
The sun is out, don't tell me off for lazing
It's so hot 'cause my ice cream's melting
We're only used to the same rain belting
Belting down, why don't we take the top down
And drive around and pump up the sound
Leave this desk, oh yes, this is a protest
Go to the seaside and you could be my guest
Rest assured, you know we'll have a good time
Bathe in the sea and bathe in the sunshine
We've got all day 'cause this time is all mine
We'll take it easy, the sun goes down at nine
We'll take a hamper with some cashews and shampoos
Now and then we need a good pamper
We'll make our way for the day with much promptness
Excuse me while I make the most of this

(CHORUS:)
Come on, let me take you there, this is something we can share
Come on, let me take you there, ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh yeah
Come on, let me take you there, this is something we can share
Come on, let me take you there, ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh yeah
Take proctection now, don't say I didn't warn ya
You must be careful, you'll go as pink as a lobster
Only have to look at the sun and then I go brown
Don't want to upset you, come on, let's go to the fairground
The house of fun, the big wheel and the dungeons
There's loads to do, so many of them
I don't feel like going back to the grindstone
But what'll we do when the sun goes down

(CHORUS)
Ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh yeah

(CHORUS)
(REPEAT CHORUS TO FADE)
