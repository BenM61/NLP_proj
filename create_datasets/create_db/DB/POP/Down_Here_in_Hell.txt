I really love it when 
love it when we make mistakes 
because once again 
it gives me a reason to complain 
I love the battle lines 
battle lines we draw across the mud 
oh, I love it when we fight 
standing on the verge of breaking up or making love 

What would I do if we were perfect 
Where would I go for disappointment 
Love without pain would leave me wondering why I stay 

I think I'm savin' myself 
but with nothing to complain about in heaven what am I to do 
I think I'm savin' myself 
but I wouldn't want to work it out down here in hell with you 

I wanna make you feel the fire 
wanna burn you with my bad days 
oh, wanna be unsatisfied 
so you can fell the heat coming from me baby 

What would I do if we were perfect 
Where would I go for disappointment 
words without hate would leave me nothin' left to say 

I think I'm savin' myself 
but with nothing to complain about in heaven what am I to do 
I think I'm savin' myself 
but I wouldn't want to work it out down here in hell with you (2x)
