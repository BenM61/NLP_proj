I'm feeling funny, feeling high
They looking at me, I don't mind
Now it is easy to walk on by
I don't want what you got so you better move along

I ain't gonna break for that
I'm a Wonder Woman
I ain't gonna take all that
I'm a Wonder Woman
That'll get you nowhere
You don't wanna see what happens when I get provoked
You don't wanna go there
See me spin around, see me swing my golden rope

Oh I got power, Pisces sign
They shouted at me, watch out behind
They can't catch me, cause I'm too strong
They all want what I got, never leaving me alone

I ain't gonna break for that
I'm a Wonder Woman
I ain't gonna take all that
I'm a Wonder Woman
You don't wanna go there
Trying to confuse me say I need you when I know I don't
That'll get you nowhere
Go on and try me you can't catch me you just blowing smoke

Uh, I think you playing games
This ain't no Catwoman
Uh, I think you playing games
I don't need a bad girl

Oh I got power, Pisces sign
They shouted at me, watch out behind
They can't catch me, cause I'm too strong
They all want what I got, never leaving me alone

I ain't gonna break for that
I'm a Wonder Woman
I ain't gonna take all that
I'm a Wonder Woman
That'll get you nowhere
