I took a ride on your fingertips
Heaven high with the thrill of it
And in your eyes for a moment
Its like we never said goodbye
We took a walk for the hell of it
And we talk through the thick of it
And in your eyes for a moment
Its like we never said good bye

But something went wrong
You never came home
And time takes so long
What are these tears we're crying

'Cos I remember the open roads
Met at the corner where no one goes
And no one mattered at all
And I remember the driving rain
Soaked to the skin these were perfect days
And I remember it all

Friend is such a horrid word
Is it at home with the thing we learned
You didn't phone
And in a different world
We'd have never said goodbye

Where are we going with feeling alone
Time takes so long
And what are these tears were crying

'cos I remember the open roads
Met at the corner where no one goes
And no one mattered at all
And I remember the driving rain
Soaked to the skin these were perfect days
And I remember it all

And as for then and as for now
As for who and as for how
There's just one thing I cant forget
How beautiful you are
