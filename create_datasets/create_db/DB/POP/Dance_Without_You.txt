So serious, all the time
I feel restrained.
I feel confined.
I cannot take your whispering, your whispering

I wanna dance without you
For once just let me lose myself
I wanna dance without you
For once just let me lose myself
For once let me lose myself

So insecure, so uptight
I break my neck, to be polite
I cannot take your whispering, your whispering

I wanna dance without you
For once just let me lose myself
I wanna dance without you
For once just let me lose myself
For once let me lose myself

How can I make history, with your choreography?
Take your hands off me, Take your hands off me
Before I suffocate

I wanna dance without you
For once just let me lose myself
I wanna dance without you
For once just let me lose myself lose myself
For once let me lose myself
