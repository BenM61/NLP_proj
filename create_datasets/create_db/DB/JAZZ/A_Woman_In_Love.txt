Your eyes are the eyes of a woman in love
And though how they give you away
Why try to deny your a woman in love
When I know very well would I see 
I see no moon in the sky
Ever lent such a glow
Some flame deep within made them shine

Those eyes are the eyes of a woman in love
And may they gaze ever more into mine
Crazily gaze ever more into mine

Those eyes are the eyes of a woman in love
And may they gaze ever more into mine
Crazily gaze ever more into mine
