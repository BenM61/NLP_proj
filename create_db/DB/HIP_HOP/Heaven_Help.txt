There comes a time
To be free of the heart
I want to be ready, 
Ready to start
On a love journey, 
I got places to go
Made up my mind that 
I've got to let you know

[Chorus]
Heaven help the heart
That lets me inside
Heaven help the man
Who comes in my life
Heaven help the fool
That walks through my door
'cause I decided right now
That I'm ready for love

This funny feeling's 
Coming over me
Now I'm inspired and 
I'm open to be
In a love place, 
But it's out of my hands
I'm telling you baby, 
You just got to understand

[Chorus]

I can't see what's out there 
For me, baby
And I know love offers no guarantee
But I'll take a chance and 
I'm telling you something, baby
Gotta let you know

[Chorus]
