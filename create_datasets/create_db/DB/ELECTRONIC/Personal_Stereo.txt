This one goes out to the one I love
This one goes out to the one I love
This one goes out to the one I love
Coming to you, on your personal stereo

I'm coming back to play
But I don't know the rules
And I'm nobody's fool but myself
So should I stay, or should I walk away?

I'm coming back to play
But I don't know the rules
And I don't know the name of this game
So if you want it any other way it's OK

I'm coming back to play
But I don't know the rules
And I'm nobody's fool but myself
So if you want it any other way I would stay

I coming back to play
But there are still things to learn
About religion science and love
I'm an amateur and you're a pro
