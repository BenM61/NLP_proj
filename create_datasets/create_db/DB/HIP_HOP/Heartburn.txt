Let me, let me, let me tell you somethin'
Tell you how I feel
When he comes around
I get to feelin' ill
It's an achin' feelin'
Inside my chest
It's like I'm going in
Into cardiac arrest

Adrenaline rushin' in my body
All my power I just can't fight it
Doesn't matter how I keep on tryin'
I can't deny, I got this

(Heartburn) burnin' in my soul
(Heartburn) call the fire department
(Heartburn) it's out of control
(Heartburn) ooh

You got me trippin', slippin'
And beside myself
I tried some medication
But don't nothin' help
So I said doctor, doctor
Tell me, will I die?!
And he said, count to five, Alicia
And I'm goin' to be alright, let's go
One, two, three, four

Adrenaline rushin' in my body
All my power I just can't fight it
Doesn't matter how I keep on tryin'
I can't deny, I got this

(Heartburn) burnin' in my soul
(Heartburn) call the fire department
(Heartburn) it's out of control
(Heartburn) ooh

Taste so good I can't resist (whoa)
Gettin' harder to digest (whoa)
Can't take no more, got to shake it off (whoa)
Now break it down, and take it to the ground with me now

Everybody say, oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh!

(Heartburn) burnin' in my soul
(Heartburn) call the fire department
(Heartburn) it's out of control
(Heartburn) whatchu tryin' to do

(Heartburn) burnin' in my soul
(Heartburn) call the fire department
(Heartburn) it's out of control
(Heartburn) ooh!

Shake it, shake it, shake it, oh
Go 'head girl
Shake it, shake it, shake it, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Shake it, shake it, shake it, oh
Go 'head girl
Shake it, shake it, shake it, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Go 'head girl!
Ooh, ooh, ooh
