I've seen it all
All through eyes
Heard it in ears
Smelled it alright
Do do you believe you can hide?
I've seen it all
I go under the earth
And listen to the dead people talk
They tell stories

They know it all
They tell stories of you
Do do you believe you can hide?
I've seen it all
Princess Crocodile
A heart full of bells
Rings in your moves
Whatever you do, I see it all in you
