I guess there's no good reason for livin'...
But I'll keep on livin' for you, baby...
There's nothing else to do, babe...
But spend my life holding you and lovin' you...

Oh...
If I ask you more than one million times to forgive me...
You think of a reason why...
That you should make me cry (don't make me cry)...
Walk out and say goodbye away from me...

Oh...
I'm tired of the bright ideas about leavin' me...
When you know you ain't goin' nowhere...
But here with me...
Here with me...
Let me tell you a thing...
Stop and think of just how good I've been to you baby...

I'm causin' no trouble for you baby...
This story just can't be true, baby...
How can I convince you, baby...
But just tell you the truth...

I'm livin' for you... givin' for you... waitin' for you...
(lemme tell you what I'm doin'...)
I'm layin' for you... prayin' for you... workin' for you...
(...livin' my life, I tell you that...)
I'm livin' for you... givin' for you... givin' for you...
Layin' for you... prayin' for you... workin' for you...
(everything I do I still...)
Do with you... (something to) do with you...

(Fade)
