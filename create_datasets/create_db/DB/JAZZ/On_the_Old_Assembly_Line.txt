On the old assembly line 
On the old assembly line 
Everything is hum-hum-hummin? 
On the old assembly line 
When the overalls combine 
With the mighty dollar sign 
there'll be miles and miles 
Of American smiles 
From the factory to the mine 
On the old assembly line 
(repeat once) 
(spoken): 
I'm the farmer who tills the soil 
I'm the driller who drills the oil 
I forge the rivets that weld the tanks 
I buy the bonds in a thousands banks 
I build the ships we?re proud to sail 
I give my man a full dinner pail 
I clerk 
I fight 
I warden at night 
I plan 
I rig 
I jockey a jeep 
Ships, cars, planes, tanks 
North, south, east and west 
Turn the wheels and tanks 
For the millions of Yanks 
From the factory to the mine 
On the old assembly line!
