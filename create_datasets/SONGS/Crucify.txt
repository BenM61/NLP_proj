On that day I took you up
It was now or never
And I savored all you were
On our road to nowhere

I don't want to get out without you now
But you're the same as always

I know you could, but you won't leave them
I know you're cool, but you won't listen

You crucify yourself
Look what's happened baby
Are you still by yourself?
'Cause I can't reach you lately

All you said was not enough
I could not wait forever
If I had stayed to hold you up
It would not make you better

I know you could, but you won't leave them
I know you're cool, but you won't listen

You crucify yourself
Look what's happened baby
Are you still by yourself?
'Cause I can't reach you lately

You said you'd leave this
So run away
You don't need this
So run away
You said you'd leave this

I know you're cool

You crucify yourself
Look what's happened baby
Are you still by yourself?
'Cause I can't reach you lately

You crucify yourself
Look what's happened baby
I know you're cool
I can't reach you lately

Look what's happened baby
