I cut off my head and my cheetah tongue
I can't think straight and my mouth is numb
Don't shut your eyes 'til we fade to black
'Cause maybe this time the good stuff could last

You won me over
My orange cola got black flamingoes crying for ya
Well I'll see you later
I could be your faker
My hands shake like jellyfish when you're near

I cut off my head and my cheetah tongue
I can't think straight and my mouth is numb
Don't shut your eyes 'til we fade to black
'Cause maybe this time the good stuff could last

You're a hammer, sweet firecracker
Stumbling through Chinatown
Liar, liar, my house is on fire
Somewhere between Chinatown and here

I cut off my head and my cheetah tongue
I can't think straight and my mouth is numb
Don't shut your eyes 'til we fade to black
'Cause maybe this time the good stuff could last

Come a little closer, it's alright
I'll be your character with flaws tonight
Come a little closer, my firefly
You're not the only one who doesn't want to be alone tonight

I cut off my head and my cheetah tongue
I can't think straight and my mouth is numb
Don't shut your eyes 'til we fade to black
'Cause maybe this time the good stuff could last
