Find me where I'm hiding call me I will come to you.
And in the midnite hours you tease me out with thoughts of you
so you can paint a scene of warmth and wine and candlelight
But can you tell me how you keep taking me, how you keep taking me to Heaven

there's something about your touch,
cause I'm walking beside you I want you so much.
You're loving me just enough to keep me coming back

How did you uncover that small voice inside of me.
Nothing's been the same, not since you got right to the heart of me.
And how you take your knife and cut the mask right off my face
and then you tell me how you're gonna keep on taking me taking me to Heaven

There's something about your touch,
when I'm lying beside you I need you so much,
keep loving me just enough to keep me coming back
There's something about your touch,
when I'm walking beside you I need you so much
you're loving me just enough to keep me coming back

And in the end you understand
you will always have my hand
In my wildest dreams,
I never thought that anyone could make me feel the way that you can,
baby ohhhhhhh
and when you touch me -- would it be - touch me baby, please put your --
put your hands all over me
there's something about your touch
when I'm walking beside you I want you so much,
you're loving me just enough to keep me coming back
Oh there's something about your touch --
when I'm walking beside you I want you so much -

You're loving me just enough
to keep me coming back - oh to keep
-- won't you please -- won't you touch me - touch me baby
please -- please - so put your hands all, put them all over me
there's something about your touch --
and I'm lying beside you I want you so much --
you're loving me just enough to keep me . . .
