One drop of rain
On your window pane
Doesn't mean to say
There's a thunderstorm comin'
The rain may pour
For an hour or more
But it doesn't matter
You know it doesn't matter

One gentle breeze
Blowin'softly through the trees
Doesn't mean to say
There's a hurricane hummin'
Don't start runnin'
Everytime you hear it comin'
'Cause it doesn't matter
You know it doesn't matter

One little word
That you may have overheard
Doesn't mean to say
That my love for you is dyin'
Don't start cryin'
Over second-hand lyin'
Say it doesn't matter
You know it doesn't matter

It's a storm in a teacup
Brewin' up double
Almost any little trouble
It's a storm in a teacup
It really doesn't matter
If it pitter pitter patters all the day

Pitter patter, pitter patter, pitter patter

One little word
That you may have overheard
Doesn't mean to say
That my love for you is dyin'
Don't start cryin'
Over second-hand lyin'
Say it doesn't matter
You know it doesn't matter

It's a storm in a teacup
Brewin' up double
All those tiny little troubles
It's a storm in a teacup
It really doesn't matter
If it pitter pitter patters all the day

Pitter patter, pitter patter, pitter patter

One drop of rain
On your window pane
Doesn't mean to say
There's a thunderstorm comin'
The rain may pour
For an hour or more
But it doesn't matter
You know it doesn't matter
One gentle breeze
Blowin'softly through the trees
