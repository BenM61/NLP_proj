My my stomach hurts again tonight she says:
And crashes on her floor

Cuts what she can't untie

Ties it to a door
If mercy was a cattle call
She didn't hear
She didn't want to play the role
Of the fool again
Won't be fooled again

Indifference as my witness
I think she'd take me back
She tears down my front door
Just to see my photograph

My my head is getting so confused she says
What's she trying to do to me?
Put my sticker on her car
Bought a CD
If mercy was a cattle call
She didn't hear
She didn't want to play the role of the fool again
Won't be fooled again

Indifference as my witness
I think she'd take me back
She tears down my front door
Just to hear my phonograph

It spins
I ain't too proud to beg sweet darlin'
Don't you leave me baby don't you go
I ain't too proud to beg sweet darlin'
Don't you leave me

My my skin can't take much more of this, she says
You're scaling over me.
Every time I wash it off, I find you underneath
And if mercy was a cattle call
She didn't hear
She didn't want to play the role of the fool again
Won't be fooled again
