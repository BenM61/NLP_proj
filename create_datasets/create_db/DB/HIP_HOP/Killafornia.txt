Living in the city of the Scandalous
Shisty motherfuckers, can't even trust my own brothers
So who can I choose to trust, me, that's who
Niggas want a piece of the pie, f*ck off and die!
Jealous, envious fools want to rush this
Loco, trooping ass nigga with the cash, shit
Motherfuckers just get your own, and leave mine alone
Forty-five places to get done
Send out your invitation
To the party of your elimination
I got peeps that play for keeps, (Hardball)
Now I'm laying your ass down to sleep
But every hustler wants to be bawling
But I got the balls for the shot calling
I pull strings, the Don King, only in America
Then I hustle, and flex my muscle

Yeah, man, I've been out here
running game for eight years
I know I'm getting tired of standing
on this corner
Nigga, I want a fat pad, and fly ass pool
Finest motherfucking bitches, jewels
and all that shit, if I got to take it
from a nigga
Shit, let him run for me then
I can work for myself, don't have to
work for nobody, I'll be my own hustler

Where can I roam to get my hustle on
Killafornia, stacking the chips, got the full clips
Loaded and cocked, I'm used to running with the Glock
Nina Millimeter, lighting up the fucking block
Now, who you gonna trust?, who can you trust?
I don't know, but if you coming on my corner
I think I'm gonna bust
You can't handle us, devious, dangerous
Criminal mentality, insanity
I move weight, from state to state
All the niggas moving weights, can you relate?

Damn, what's up, I see you
pushing that big time weight
I told you, I wasn't bullshitting
You coming up, alright!
When I seen you three or four
months ago I told you
Got respect for a man now
Handle your shit!

Where can I choose to get my hustle on?
In the alleyway, lighting up all night long
F*ck working at McD's, I'm rolling with the O.Z's
In the QP's, puffing on trees
Who can I trust?, who can you trust?
Not that shady motherfucker in the city Los Scandalous

Well, well, little man came up a little bit
It feels good having money in the pocket
F*ck that nine to five bullshit, right?
Yeah, kick that shit to the curb
But you got to look out for the scandalous motherfuckers
'cause niggas is tricky than a motherfucker
Yeah, but motherfuckers got to look out for us too
You know what I'm saying
I'm just as shisty as a nigga
Shit, set me up and niggas are gonna die
You get set up back, 'cause we ain't having that bullshit
I got your back, you got mine, that goes without saying
Twenty-seven and mo' baby, twenty-seven and mo'
Let's get the f*ck out of here"
