You outta see that girl of mine
Always dressed up looking nice
Spending money on the latest styles
I guess she thinks it drives me wild
It don't take no fancy clothes to turn this cowboy on

It could be
Blue jeans or mini skirt
A tank top or my old work shirt
It don't matter what she's wearing
Ohhh that girl she's got me staring
That dress looks good for sure
I like it better laying on the floor
From head to toe I love it all
Now take it off

She don't need to get all dolled up
Could care less about all that stuff
High heels
Fish nets
Don't mean a thing to this here redneck
But one thing I know for sure
Less is always more

It could be
Blue jeans or mini skirt
A tank top or my old work shirt
It don't matter what she's wearing
Ohhh that girl she's got me staring
That dress looks good for sure
I like it better laying on the floor
From head to toe I love it all
Now take it off
It could be
Blue jeans or mini skirt
A tank top or my old work shirt
It don't matter what she's wearing
Ohhh that girl she's got me staring
That dress looks good for sure
I like it better laying on the floor
From head to toe I love it all
Now take it off

She could cover every magazine from Cosmo down to Field and Stream
But I prefer to see her not wearing a thing
Lead ride

It could be
Blue jeans or mini skirt
A tank top or my old work shirt
It don't matter what she's wearing
Ohhh that girl she's got me staring
That dress looks good for sure
I like it better laying on the floor
From head to toe I love it all
Now take it off
She wears
Blue jeans or mini skirt
A tank top or my old work shirt
It don't matter what she's wearing
Ohhh that girl she's got me staring
That dress looks good for sure
I like it better laying on the floor
From head to toe I love it all
Like a ball cap and some cover alls
Cut off shorts a bit too small
Ain't no doubt it turns me own
Now take it off
