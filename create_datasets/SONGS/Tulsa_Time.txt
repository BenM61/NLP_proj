Well I left Oklahoma
Driving in a Pontiac
Just about to lose my mind
I was going to Arizona
Maybe on to California
People all living so fine
My momma called me crazy 
My baby said I'm lazy 
Gonna show em all this time
Cause you know I ain't no fooling 
I don't need no more damn school
Want to just walk the line

Living on Tulsa time
Living on Tulsa time
Gonna set my watch back to it 
Cause you know me, I've been through it 
Living on Tulsa time

So there I was in Hollywood 
Thinking I was doing good
Talking on the telephone line 
They don't want me in the movies
Ain't nobody sing my song
Momma says my baby's doing fine
So then I started thinking 
And I got to weaken 
I really had a flash this time
I had no business leaving 
Ain't nobody would be grieving
Seen I'm on Tulsa time

Living on Tulsa time
Living on Tulsa time
Gonna set my watch back to it 
Cause you know me, I've been through it 
Living on Tulsa time
