Stand by me, I've been stood by you for ages
Stick home and carry on
Maybe nothing's wrong
Is it the comfort of
This information or
Is it the freedom that you feel,
Said I'm the angel of, liberation or
For a second a believer

I'm all your here
While you're here
Don't call it a comeback
Look what I invented here,
I thought it was easy
They can't take it away from us,
The last days of disco

All raved out, bitter is the pill of devotion
Read between the noise, all you disco boys
The fascination of,
A boy and girl in love,
For a second I could see that
In the mir above,
The human animal or a creature that I feel

I'm all your here
While you're here
Don't call it a comeback
Look what I invented here,
I thought it was easy
They can't take it away from us,
The last days of disco
The last days of disco
The last days of disco

I'm all your here
While you're here
Don't call it a comeback,
We'll hold an event in here
This space is beautiful
I'll decide when it is over
So don't call it a comeback,
Look what I invented here
I thought it was easy
They can't take it away from us,
The last days of disco,
The last days of disco,
The last days of disco.
