Boot camp ties and we're not so free
Always thought you could be more like me, more like me
Twenty three years and you're out of time 
Money's on fire and you're making me proud
Sleeping all day with the radio on
Local jokes but not for long

You give me life still, let me breathe
Keep my face on, you're what I need
Leave the lights on, you're all I see
Getting wasted, you're all I need

Followed cars and following you
Living large, hit 'em we're through
I fought JP it felt so weak
Bent up in the corner its not for free

You give me life still, let me breathe
Keep my face on, you're all I need
Leave the lights on, you're all I see
Bent and wasted, you're what I need
