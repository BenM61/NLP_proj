Bad brakes, whole car shakes.
Looks like I'm heading for a breakdown.
Black smoke, engine beginning to choke.
I must be heading for a breakdown.

I pulled up for a mouth of coca-cola
Down at samuel's cafe.
Saw a little spanish lady coming over;
Said: "Lady are you going my way?"  She said: "O-lay."

Bad brakes, carburetor shakes.
Looks like you're heading for a breakdown.
Black smoke, engine beginning to choke.
We must be heading for a breakdown.

We hit the road at ninety miles an hour;
Heading for 'frisco bay.
She said: "Senor, you got cop on your shoulder."
I said: "Oh, now we'd better not stay,
We got to get away with our
Bad brakes, carburetor shakes;
Looks like we're heading for a breakdown"

He was catching up, nose right inside our mirror
When the motor blowed.
We climbed out and she began to shiver.
Oh, no, sir please let us go?
He said: "Don't you know you got
Bad brakes, carburetor shakes;
Looks like you bought yourself a breakdown.
Black smoke, engine beginning to choke,
And you've got yourself a breakdown."

Bad brakes, engine beginning to shake;
Looks like we've got ourselves a breakdown.
Black smoke, engine beginning to choke;
We got ourselves a breakdown.
