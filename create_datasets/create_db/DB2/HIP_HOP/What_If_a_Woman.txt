What if a woman
Had a man on the side
And she never spent time with you
What if a woman
Said she's working late
And it's always the same excuse
What if a woman
Took the keys to your whip
Said I'll be right back 
Don't trip
What if a woman
Left you home with the kids 
Changing diapers and shit
What a twist

Could you stand inside her shoes and walk a mile
(I don't really think so)
Could you hold her down when she doesn't smile
(I don't know a man who could)
What if a woman
What if a woman
What if a woman
Was just like you
What if a woman
What if a woman
What if a woman
Was just like you(try to imagine that) 
What if a woman
What if a woman
What if a woman
Was just like us what if a woman
Was just like us what if a woman
Was just like us what if a woman
Could you ever wonder if she does

What if a woman
Started wearing the pants
Would you feel less of a man and more
Never wanna settle down
Always wanna run around
On the low
You can beg
You can plead
You can cry
She won't be your wife- but your eyes are full of tears
She'll be running the streets
With girls hanging out tonight
It's the same thing you do to her

Could you stand inside her shoes and walk a mile
(See I don't really think so)
Could you hold her down when she doesn't smile
(I don't know a man who could)
What if a woman
What if a woman
What if a woman
Was just like you
What if a woman
What if a woman
What if a woman
Was just like you (try to imagine that)
What if a woman
What if a woman
What if a woman
Was just like us
Could you ever wonder if she does
If the table were turned around
Would you leave
Would you stay
Would you drown
If the cards you were dealt were to change
Would you let your hand go up in flames
