Your always waiting on the tides 
It's time you decide 
I've walked down long roads that seem to have no end at all 
You never wanted time to end 
To let my life offend 
It's time to realize what hides deep inside holy eyes 
Hold on tight Hold on fast 
This ain't the kind that always lasts 
If you want me to go just ask me 
To go I'd go

All the way my love  over the hills and 
Right on to you Run away my love 
Over the hills and right on through you 
Over the hills and right on through you 
Lying awake in these restless dreams 
Life's never what it seems 
I've always tried to read your eyes 
To get inside that scornful mind 
Hold on tight Hold on fast 
This ain't the kind that always lasts 
If you want me to go just ask me 
To go I'd go

All the way my love over the hills 
And right on through you- all the 
Way my love over the hills and right 
On through you... 

I was with you- that pallet 
Steaming spinning round in circles 
Dreaming I was with you on that 
Pallet steaming running round in 
Circles screaming

All the way my love over the hills and 
Right on to you Run away my love 
Over the hills and right on through you 
Over the hills and right on through you 
Lying awake in these restless dreams 
Life's never what it seems 
I've always tried to read your eyes 
To get inside that scornful mind 
Hold on tight Hold on fast 
This ain't the kind that always lasts 
If you want me to go just ask me 
To go I'd go
