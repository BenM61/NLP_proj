It happens that someone knocks at my door
And the whole house starts to shake
So that it gets really hard to stand up
And even worse to walk
I usually fall down on the floor

And I stay there until that someone decides to leave
And the house calms down
And I look through the curtains
To see if he would regret
To see if he would try again

It happens that someone calls me on the phone
Then my heart gets so scared
That it jumps right up into my throat!
I swallow like crazy
Hoping my heart will glide back down
So I can talk to that someone
Maybe talk to a friend
But it is too late

It is beyond my control 
If I don't open up the door
It is beyond my control
If I don't answer your calls
I'm not to blame. It isn't my fault
It was you that made my heart shake
It was you that made my heart jump

And it happens that I take a walk outside
Just to get some nice fresh air
And it happens that I see someone I knew
A long, long time ago

Then I just seem to disappear
Becoming one with a wall
Becoming one with a lamp post
Becoming one with a tree
Becoming one with a street
Becoming one with a house
Becoming one with a door
Becoming one with you all

It is beyond my control
If I don't open up the door
It is beyond my control
If I don't answer your calls
It is beyond my control
If I just seem to disappear
It is beyond my control
If I am suddenly not here

I'm not to blame. It isn't my fault
It was you that made my heart shake
It was you that made my heart jump

It was you that came my way
