This isn't another new fashion
Or a new wave plastic trend
Everybody's searching for something
But in the mean time let's all just pretend
I've got this feeling
And I don't know what it is
This room is overcrowded, man
And I need air to breath

Big bang, big crunch
You know there's no free lunch
Kneel down and pray
Here comes your judgment day
Big crunch, you know
It's going to be quite a show
What goes around always comes around

A million hopeless faces
Dwell within protected walls
All waiting for a moment in their lives
When they can heed the clarion call
And it's all so oppressive
My mind feels like a sieve
This city is overcrowded, man
And I need room to live

I think of the countless shadows
That have all come and gone
All suffering in the notion of better things to come
If you share these beliefs
You know I wish you well
'Cause there's no room left in heaven
And there's sure no room in hell
