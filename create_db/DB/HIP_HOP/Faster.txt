Hold your breath
Yeah yeah
Whoa oh oh
Yeah
I'm feelin' like I'm whippin' in a Porsche girl 
You all up in my thoughts 
Its simple & reinforced
Love that love that that that love
So much that we should back up
You never feel it til it happens 
Then it happens
Cause I guaranteed your life 
Is like math subtract it from your past
And the math you think its like fast 
Talladega honey moon up in Vegas sharin' paper
Cross my fingers hopin' we don't break up 
Now we made it through the basics
We seen it in an instant
Girl id love to see your ass naked 
We should stay connected
Every second record is a 
Girl you got me smilin' so "F" it
I take it there I take it as a blessing
I use it as a weapon
I rhyme they should use it as a reference
When people stay stick together we forever its embedded
And every time we go somewhere we always leave a presence, the essence 

Hold your breath
Don't let this go away
Its moving faster faster faster
Don't let go (don't let go)
Night and day
Its moving faster faster faster 

From mix to the intense 
The second I hope you smell the incense
Entice the moment of innocence
This how we came together
For better bon suited on how to break hearts
Separated then secluded 
Desire was a overwhelming conclusion
Those things of passion created a guard for the delusion 
It makes sense
In a mutual choice the muse 
And states of simple bliss forever we still here 
And in a intense climax the moment a miss 
And the moment of passion is intense enough to commence 
At last we in the depths of orgasm
The experience brought us this far
Now we out fast 
Take the time when expand emotions recommence to the intense
The second is innocence 
Guess the time when expand emotions to the 8 tenths 
A second of innocence, innocence 

Hold your breath
Don't let this go away
Its moving faster faster faster
Don't let go (don't let go)
Night and day
Its moving faster faster faster 

Yeah its like you million miles away
And I cant take that 
Lets get that grip and see where that take us
You need that, feelin' that young girls dream of the Italy
Gotta lay her boat up stream
Love that Paris in the springtime
Wakiki when I, 
When I lost in your eyes I see me in ya
It feels brand new
Just listen, ya mans true 
What you wishin' I cant do 
Its my mission, 
I plan to in addition stay through the good the bad
Whether the rain or shine 
Your remain is mine
Body and brains, ya fine
Yeah you all that and then some 
What a perfect place to begin from
And baby if you let yourself go 
Maybe we could go
Tell you this is all I know
And we could do any dance flow,
A broad way show 
Tell you this is all I know

Hold your breath
Don't let this go away
Its moving faster faster faster
Don't let go (don't let go)
Night and day
Its moving faster faster faster 

Its moving faster faster faster
Its moving faster faster faster
Its moving faster faster faster
