Everything changes when you think about it,
There's not much you can do about it.
But another broken Irish sat on park bench,
Feel his life like a gut wrench,
Like it's passing him by.
So I feel like change,
I feel like walking out and standing in the rain.
I feel like change,
I feel like change.
Everything changes as you stare at it,
We've all learned to live with it.
But another bag lady, beggar man, thief,
Another low flyer came to grief,
Can barely stand.
So I feel like change,
I feel like walking out and standing in the rain.
I feel like change,
I feel like change.
I never wanted to write this song.
It won't help what's going on-
When we look at what's going on,
Two rights could make a wrong.
(solo)
Feel like change, feel like change.
This is such a pointless fight.
Two songs won't make it right.
Three songs won't make it right.
Maybe a hundred songs might make it right.
Sing it.
So I feel like change,
I feel like change,
I feel like change.
And so I feel like change,
I feel like change,
I feel like change...
