The memory lingers on when you were the same as us.
Three months old a child, still you lived off love and fuss.

City baby, city baby, city baby attacked by rats.
Residing in a squalid place, it can't be too much fun.
Your brain is getting eaten away by the rat living in your skull.

A mutant at the age of one, a human rodent cabbage.
It's hard to think a tiny thing can do that much damage.
