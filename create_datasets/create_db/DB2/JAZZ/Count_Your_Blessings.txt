Count your blessings one by one
When dawn appears and day has just begun
They will light your heart with happiness
Make each hour bright and bring you gladness 

Count your blessings one by one
When twilight falls and toil of day is done
And in sweet dreams they'll come again to you
If you will count your blessings each day through 

Count your blessings while you may
For we are here but little time to stay
All around are hearts sincere and true
Lovely things abound just waiting for you 

Count your blessings while you may
The big or small, whichever comes your way
For then you'll find this world a place of love
If you will count your blessings from above
