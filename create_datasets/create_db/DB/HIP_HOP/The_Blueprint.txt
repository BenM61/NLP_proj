Musty fusty yet so crystal clear 
The non commercial set is now here 
Brought to you by the will of positve people 
K are S plus One equals 
Slammin' lyrics and beats unquestionable 
The peofessional while I guess that you'll 
Grab the album that rocks most on the market 
Strong hearted with a target 
  Bloo   and the target is hit 
I shot the lyric then reload the clip 
  Bloo-- another shell hits the ground 
Along with the shell my opponents weak crown 
--Bloo Bloo-- the title comes after 
What a disaster listen to the laughter 
Your heart I capture 
Cause every lecture has tecture 
If you're wack I say next sir 
Who's next cause I've got no time for weakness 
Only the teacher speaks this 
Dialect, which gains nuff resect 
Which money can't buy you yet 
I don't care cause Boogie Down Productions has both 
The most worldwide coast to coast 
We didn't do it with the soft commercial sound 
Try the ghetto cause I refuse to let go 
You see you don't understand I knew it 
You got a copy I read from the blueprint 
Keepin' it on track 
And never wack 
Please step back 
If you speak the weak rap 
Cause I alone can dis your whole pack or posse 
Stupid sit there and watch me 
You can't stop the original with a copy 
Sloppy very sloppy you slouch 
Every time I bite you yell ouch 
Breakout get lost your throat is hoarse 
You lost cause I'm dope of course 
--One and Two and Three and Four-- 
But that comes from years of practice 
Anti-slackness anti-wackness 
Throw on the glasses and teach the masses 
Very simple the question I ask is 
How many MCs must get stomped 
Before somebody says Kris has no calm 
Thousands both here and overseas 
If you're soft I say please leave 
Here's the door here's your hat coat and mitt 
Cause here we read from the blueprint
