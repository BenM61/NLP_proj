The night came down, jungle sounds were in my ears
City screams are all I've heard in twenty years
The razor's edge of night, it cuts into my sleep
I sit upon the edge now
Shall I make that leap?

I'm the omegaman
I'm the omegaman

The sky's alive with turned on television sets
I walk the streets and seek another vision yet
The echo makes me turn to see that last frontier
The edge of time closes down as I disappear

I'm the omegaman
I'm the omegaman
I'm the omegaman
I'm the omegaman
Always talking to myself
Oh!

The time that's best is when surroundings fade away
The presence of another world comes close to me
It's time for me to throw away this paper knife
I'm not alone in reaching for a perfect life

I'm the omegaman
I'm the omegaman
I'm the omegaman
I'm the omegaman

I'm so tired
Of the omegaman
