Hey little girl would you like a dance
Hey little girl want a quick romance
Hey little girl won't you take a chance
And celebrate summer with me
Hey little chick where did you learn that trick
Hey don't you know you got rock and roll
Hey little punk forget all that junk
And celebrate summer with me
Summer's not a bummer
This is summer
And it's now
Summer is heaven in '77
Hey little girl would you like a dance
Hey little girl want a quick romance
Hey little girl won't you be the one
To celebrate summer with me
