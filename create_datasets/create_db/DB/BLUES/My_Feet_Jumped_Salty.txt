The hookin' cow
Spoke about the little young heifer
The buckin' bull, says
"I just now left her"

Then the cow jumps salty
Now 'cause it was against her rules
Now if you think that she liked it
Well, you just a black-eyed fool

The little Guinea rooster
Told the little Guinea hen
"If I ever catch you squattin'
Around my nest again"

I will have to jump salty
Lord, 'cause it's really against my rules
Now if you think that he liked it
Well, you just a black-eyed fool

Beat it out, boy
He another black-eyed fool
My, my, my

Now two old women's
Are runnin' hand in hand
The one found out
The other one had her man

Then that woman jumped salty
Lord, 'cause it was against her rules
Now if you think that she liked it
Well, you just a black-eyed fool

I was chattin' with a girl
In the wrong place
A man cocked a pistol
Right in my face

Then my feet jumped salty
Now 'cause it was against his rules
Now if you think that I liked it
Well, you just a black-eyed fool
