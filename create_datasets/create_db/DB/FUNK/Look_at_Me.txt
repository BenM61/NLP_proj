Look at Me 

Look at me, I?m in love
Look at me, I?m in love

Look at me, I?m in love
I finally found the right girl
Someone that I can spend my life with
Spend my nights with, share my life with

Look at me, I?m in love
-- Look at me, look at me, I?m so happy
Look at me, I?m in love

Look at me, I?m in love
The preacher?s saying she?s my girl
I?m saying, ?I do? for the rest of my life
And I think it?s so nice she?s gonna be my wife

Look at me, I?m in love
-- Look at me, can?t you see I?m beaming all over
Look at me, I?m in love
-- Love, I?m in love

Joy of love is in the air
And love has blossomed around us, it?s everywhere
Oh, how happy you have made me
Let?s stay together until eternity, hey?

Look at me, I?m in love
-- Look at me, look at me, can?t you see I?m so happy
Look at me, I?m in love
-- Look at me

Look at me, I?m in love
-- Can?t you see, can?t you see I?m so happy
Look at me, I?m in love
-- Ooh, I?m in love

Look at me, I?m in love
