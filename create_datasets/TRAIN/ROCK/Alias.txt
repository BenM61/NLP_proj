The serpent knows
When the curtain falls
With denials blindfold
It greets another day

Don't believe the mask
It attempts to really lie
The perfect ten
When reality caves in

Don't tell me, tell my ghost
'Cause I blame him
For all I don't want to know
I found secrets about lies under told

Life's wrapped in a riddle
Easier said than done
Wait to play the victim
Just run and hide

Don't believe the mask
It attempts to really lie
The perfect ten
Where reality caves in

Don't tell me, tell my ghost
'Cause I blame him
For all I don't want to know
Well, I found secrets about life under told
Let them take me far away

Call back in place
It's easier to cope behind the curtain
Wipe the worries away
No thought about a consequence

Don't believe the mask
It attempts to really lie
The perfect ten
When reality caves in

Don't tell me, tell my ghost
'Cause I blame him
For all I don't want to know
Well, I found secrets about life under told
Let them take me far away
