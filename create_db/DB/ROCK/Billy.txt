Billy knows who he wants to be,
He wants to be a non-entity.
The thing about Billy is he ain't too bright,
He don't open his eyes or he sees the light.
Billy, get a life! [Repeat: x 3]

Billy!
Billy wake up before it's too late.
So for every rich guy there's a Billy-no-mates.
The thing about Billy is he ain't too bright,
He don't open his eyes or he sees the light.
Billy, get a life! [Repeat: x 3]

Billy!
