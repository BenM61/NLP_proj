If you ever get famous
Don't forget about me
I hope it's everything that you
Thought it would be

If you ever get famous
Don't forget about her
She was there boy before
Anybody cared who you were
You better remember

If you ever get famous
I say a prayer for your heart
You keep your eyes open wide and
Beware the sharks
Cause they come out in the dark

If you ever get famous
Show your face now and then
Cause all our days are so many
Ways in the wind
And we can't get them back again

So many days in the week
Let them roll on by
So many days in the week
Roll on, roll on, roll on
So many days in the week
Let them roll on by

If you ever get famous
In your white limousine
It's a rainy night and your
Headlights hit the water in the streets
And the rain beats down

And keep an eye on the driver
Cause as the highway unwinds,
Boy, the way home fades and can
Be so hard to find
Oh my oh my, oh my

So many days in the week
You keep on running round
So many days in the week
You've been running all your life
So many days in the week
In the hope to find what you're looking for
So many days

If you ever get famous
Don't forget about me
I hope it's everything that you
Thought it would be
