Sensuous motions, they get my attention.
Stir it up easy to find the right position.
Don't rush, don't hurry now, take your time girl, get it right.
No need to accelerate, 'cause speed can kill the feelin'.
 
Keep it slow and sexy, instant aphrodisiac for the lover man.
Keep it slow and sexy, 
too much movement might hurt the back of a lover man.
 
So much passion, there's more where that came from.
Correct romancin' can never be overdone.
Girls, dey like it when I hold dem tight,
Make de love all thru de night.
Take time to do it right 'cause speed can kill the feeling.

Keep it slow and sexy,

Keep it slow and sexy.
