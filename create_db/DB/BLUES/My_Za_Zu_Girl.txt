When you see me in a hurry
I am busy don't you worry
Getting a place to break 'em down
My Za Zu gal's in town

Everything is hunky-dory
As a moving picture story
Plant my home with morning glories
My Za Zu gal's in town

I don't have to worry
'Bout a thrill or two
Because I know just what my
Za Zu gal can do

When she start her sweet romancin'
I go into triple trancing
We forget the dine an dancin'
My Za Zu gal's in town

'Get it'

When you see me in a hurry
I am busy don't you worry
Getting a place to break 'em down
My Za Zu gal's in town, ah!

Everything is hunky-dory
As a moving picture story
Plant my home with morning glories
My Za Zu gal's in town

I don't have to worry
'Bout a thrill or two
Because I know just what
That Za Zu gal can do

Get in too, now
