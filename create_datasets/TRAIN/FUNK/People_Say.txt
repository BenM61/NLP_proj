Powers of today so pretty darnn confused 
Giving everybody in the world the blues 
Food is getting high and the fuel is getting low 
The rich are getting richer 
And the poor are getting poor 
People say, people say 
Have I got a right to live 
People say, people say 
Have I got a right to live 
People say, people say 
(What the people say) 
(What the people) 
Have your share and my share 
And your share is my share too 
Your eyes are blind folded 
And your mind controlled 
What the powers do to you 
Destruction is in the air, oh yeah 
And when is it going to quit 
Somebody end the madness 
Gettin' sick and tired of it 
People say, people say 
Have I got a right to live 
People say, people say 
Have I got a right to live 
People say, people say 
(What the people say) 
(What the people) 
(What the people say) 
(What the people say) 
(What the people say) 
(What the people say) 
(What the people say) 
You gotta listen to 'em (What the people say) 
Robbing and they're stealing 
And they're breaking in your home 
It's getting a little dangerous 
To walk the street alone 
Somebody better get on the case 
Real thing (Real Thing) 
And you got no time to waste 
People say, people say 
Have I got a right to live 
People say, people say 
Have I got a right to live 
People say, people say 
(What the people say) 
(What the people)
