Yeah baby
That's the soul drummers

Have you heard them cooking? (The soul drummers)
Well, they play so cool (The soul drummers)
It's so hard to resist (The soul drummers)
With the African twist (The soul drummers)

Oh, you know they can swing (The soul drummers)
That African thing (The soul drummers)
When they play that beat (The soul drummers)
That's to move my feet (The soul drummers)

Yeah, baby, oooh
Sack it to me

I wanna know what I mean (The soul drummers)
Well, at the best time to see (The soul drummers)
And from all of the town (The soul drummers)
People gather 'round (The soul drummers)

And when they get that feeling (The soul drummers)
No matter where they're from (The soul drummers)
That's what let people shout (The soul drummers)
Don't give the drummer's sound (The soul drummers)
Yeah

Yeah, baby, oooh
Give me some

Listen to him

Oh, don't you love them now? (The soul drummers)
When they play so cool (The soul drummers)
Yeah they move so good (The soul drummers)
Oh, they play so good (The soul drummers)

Sack it to me, baby
Oooh

Make me shout

Aha

Yeah, you love them now (The soul drummers)
When they play so good (The soul drummers)
Now they make you wanna move (The soul drummers)
Or they make you wanna dance (The soul drummers)

Don't stop it now

Sack it to me
