Our friends think we're opposites
Falling in and out of love
They all said we'd never last
Still we manage to stay together

There's no easy explanation for it
But whenever there's a problem
We always work it out somehow
Work it out somehow

They said, it wouldn't last
We had to prove them wrong
'Cause I've learned in the past
That love will never do without you

Other guys have tried before
To replace you as my lover
Never did I have a doubt
Boy it's you, I can't do without

I feel better when I have you near me
'Cause no other love around
Has quite the same, ooh ooh
Like you do, do, do, do babe

They said, it wouldn't last
We had to prove them wrong
'Cause I've learned in the past
That love will never do without you
