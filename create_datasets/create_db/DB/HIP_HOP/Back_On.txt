(Go) Gucci back home with the bling on
And if you think I ain't strapped, then you think wrong
I ain't goin' back and forth, this ain't ping pong
Get your leg torn off, whole head blown
I was selling bales before I sold a ringtone
The whole hood know my number like Mike Jones
Yellowbone and she dancing in a pink thong
She ask me can we make love with my mink on
I call my migo plug, now, nigga, pack gone
Trapped a trailer full of strong, this my backbone
I used to sell half a ounces out a trailer home
I seen friends turn to foes 'cause the paper gone

I had to cut lil' mama off, now we back on
They think I'm still selling soft like his bag gone
I was gone for a minute, now it's back on
I'm self made and independent, yup, black on
I had to cut lil' mama off, now we back on
They think I'm still selling soft like his bag gone
I was gone for a minute, now it's back on

Gucci Mane a menace (menace back on)
A hundred grand spent at the dentist
Hold up, I'm not even finished
I'm the realest nigga living
I'm the best that ever did it
Here's a message to my critics
F*ck your bitch, go get some business
I just bought my bitch a Bentley
Hold up, I'm lyin' I bought my bitch a business
My wife say she worth twenty millis
We drive a Lambo through the city
I think I'm Rambo with the semi
