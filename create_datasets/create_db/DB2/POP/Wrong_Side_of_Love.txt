Don't wanna hear it.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Baby, it's clear that,
Your past has your vision clouded.
You're countin' on the heartaches;
You're bettin' on the bad breaks;
You're looking at the wrong side of love.

Honey let me help you,
Get a hold of the situation.
I can tell that you've been,
Livin' with misinformation.
Stop talkin' 'bout the hard times;
Start walkin' in the sunshine;
Stop lookin' at the wrong side of love.

Lookin' at the wrong side,
That's no way to find it.
Lookin' at the wrong side,
Your heartache has you blinded.
Just turn around, look at me,
You'll see how right love can be.
Stop looking at the wrong side of love.

Don't want you to miss out.
Don't want you to do without it.
Darlin', there's no doubt,
You don't know enough about it.
If you're ever gonna get wise;
Open up those blue eyes;
Stop looking at the wrong side of love.

Lookin' at the wrong side,
That's no way to find it.
Lookin' at the wrong side,
Your heartache has you blinded.
Just turn around, look at me,
You'll see how right love can be.
Stop looking at the wrong side of love.
Oh, stop it.

You're lookin' at the wrong side,
That's no way to find it.
Lookin' at the wrong side,
Your heartache has you blinded.
Just turn around, look at me,
You'll see how good love can be,
On the right side.
C'mon over to the right side.

Stop looking at the wrong side of love.
Stop looking at the wrong side of love.
