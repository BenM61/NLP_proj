Take my lips and give me yours
Take my arms and give me yours
Take my heart and give me yours
Till we two are one

Just one kiss if we should dare
Just one love for us to share
Just one acts to see us there
Till we two are one

There could be heavenly
Dreams we take and give for
Thrillingly, willingly
Moments that we live for

Take my lips and give me yours
Take my arms and give me yours
Take my heart and give me yours
Till we two are one

MM MM MM, and give me yours
MM MM MM and give me your

There could be heavenly
Dreams we take and give for
Thrillingly, willingly
Moments that we live for

Take my lips and give me yours
Take my arms and give me yours
Take my heart and give me yours
Till we two are one
