I wonder who she's seeing tonight
Is she really going out with him
He's not her type
And doing all the things she used to do to me
Well, I'd say something to her
But I get so jealous
When I think of her loving somebody else
That I can't think why we ever let go
I must have been crazy

Tell me what kind of fool am I
To just let go,
To just let go like that
What kind of fool am I
To lose you

She was cold sometimes
But she made me feel alive
She was such a spoiled baby
But baby, she could love
And she loved me like nobody ever will again
I thought we'd be together
When the world ran down
When the curtain fell and the lights came up
But the gods or whatever make the world go round
Shuffled when they should have cut

Tell me what kind of fool am I
To just let go,
To just let go like that
What kind of fool am I
To lose you

Did it come too easy to the two of us
Did we go too wrong to ever make it right
Were we too busy checking out the left hand
That we didn't see the right

Tell me what kind of fool am I
To just let go,
To just let go like that
What kind of fool am I

Oh baby, please, oh baby, please come back
I meant to say in time
Baby we could work it out
But I never meant to say goodbye

Tell me what kind of fool am I
What kind of fool am I
What kind of fool am I
To lose you
