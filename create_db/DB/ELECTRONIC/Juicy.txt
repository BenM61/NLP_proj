Here we go

I got somebody's dying
You're like a soap opera cover
My love of suffer demands
Juicy
Juicy

You said somebody's saying
You're like a salve for a leper
You sweeten somebody's pain
Juicy
Juicy

Yeah, you gotta live for your own
You say you got all the sordid detail
Check out retail
Watch it sell
J-J-J-Juicy

(I got a delay)
(Mothers, children on the street can't get enough to eat) Juicy
(Off the record issues fly...Don't know the reason why?) Juicy
(Meet me down the checkout stand...You could be the lover man) Juicy
(Conscience bleeding in a song, Juicy as the day is long.)
(Goodbye)

Yeah, you gotta live for your own
You say you got all the sordid detail
Check out retail
Watch it sell

I've got to see that lie
You say what you've got to say
You gotta know it's a bitter poison, sapping all your soul away
