Leaving the keys behind me
I felt you in the dust
A feeling crept inside me
Like twisted wire and rust

Goes where the headlights led me
The ancient trade routes call
The trees close in around me
Too dark to see them all

Broom dusters inside once more
Find out what you're breathing for
'Cause I like a distant call
That sends a strange moon rising

Dead branches in the distance
Your silhouette a shade
My primal fears awaken
You shout across the lake

Broom dusters inside once more
Find out what you're breathing for
'Cause I like your distant call
That sends a strange moon rising

Broom dusters inside once more
Find out what you're breathing for
'Cause I like a distant call
That sends a strange moon rising
