They shot him in the back
Now it's a crime to be black
So don't act surprised
When it gets vandalized

There's good cops
Bad cops
White cops
Black cops

Trayvon Martin
Ezell Ford
Michael Brown
And so many more

Government, policing, hard times
Oppression, racism, fear, suffering
Ain't easy

Gun control
Mind control
Self-control
We've dug ourselves a hole

Call it what it is
Murder
