There's a land of beginning again
Where skies are always blue
Though we've made mistakes, that's true
Let's forget the past and start life anew
Though we wander by a river of tears

Where sunshine won't come through
Let's find that paradise where sorrow can't live
And learn the teachings of forget and forgive
In the land of beginning again
Where broken dreams come true

There's a land of beginning again
Where skies are always blue
Though we've made mistakes, that's true
Let's forget the past and start life anew
Though we wander by a river of tears

Where sunshine won't come through
Let's find that paradise where sorrow can't live
And learn the teachings of forget and forgive
In the land of beginning again
Where broken dreams come true
