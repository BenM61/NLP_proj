I guess you turn me on,
When you're gone,
For me it didn't go wrong,
we just made another song.

Off getting it alone,
Never asking if for long,
It's just that the world ain't enough,
And it never was for the two of us.

Baby, it's okay.

I guess you made me warm,
When you do the hum,
Making everybody come,
Getting creative with your charm.

I tried to be all yours,
Over line ain't answering your calls,
Don't say it's false,
I'm only following my thoughts.

Baby it's okay,
We'll make it better,
Baby, I, I'll survive,
Without these women in my life.
