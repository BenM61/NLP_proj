There's a time when you keep all that's precious
Close to your skin
There's a face in the window
Reflects everywhere that you've been
There's a romantic notion
You're dancing to some silent song
There's a reason unknown
Why a traveler keeps moving on

I'm just a passenger
I'm just a stranger at the wheel
I'm just a messenger
And I can't explain all the things I feel

So I ride
Ride down the wind
Search for the end of the road
That you know might not ever come
Come down in time
Touch every hand that you find
With a smile and a tear in your eye
To a traveler it's always goodbye

There's a whisper of love
That we keep for our innermost prayers
Longing for destination
But somehow I've never found where
There's a whirl and a blur
Where our time and our youth always slips
There's a hope for salvation
On every traveler's lips
 
I'm just a passenger
I'm just a sailor lost at sea
I'm just a messenger
And I can't explain what's inside of me

So I ride
Ride down the wind
Search for the end of the road
That you know might not ever come

Come down in time
Touch every hand that you find
With a smile and a tear in your eye

I'm just a passenger
I'm just a stranger at the wheel
A lonely messenger
And I can't explain all the things I feel

So I ride
Ride down the wind
Search for the end of the road
That you know might not ever come
Come down in time
Touch every hand that you find
With a smile
Oh and I'll ride
Ride down the wind
Search for the end of the road
That you know might not ever come
Come down in time
Touch every heart that you find
With a smile and a tear in your eye
To a traveler it's always goodbye
Goodbye
