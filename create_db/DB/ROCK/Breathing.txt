Big cars...intro music rises
Lights out...underneath disguises
We'd give anything to feel it
We are the ones...begging for more...haunted and living
And we're breathing...and we're dreaming
You smile...serving to remind me...
That when lights go out...you going to find me
You'll be the one...holding me close...reaching into me
And we're breathing...and we're dreaming
We are the ones...begging for more...can you feel it?
And we're breathing...and we're dreaming
