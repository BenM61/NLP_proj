F*ck my life, can't say that girl
Don't tell me you can save that shit
All she want is payback for the way I always play that shit
You ain't getting nothing, now I'm saying
Don't tell me you is
Nothin' like them other motherfuckers
I can make you rich (I can make you rich)
I can make you this, baby, I can make you that
I can take you there, but baby, you won't make it back
Growing sick of this and I don't wanna make you sad
Do I make you scared? Baby, won't you take me back?

Nothin' like them other motherfuckers
I can make you rich (I can make you rich)
Nothin' like them other motherfuckers
I can make you rich (I can make you rich)

Down another lonely road, I go
Just another lonely road, oh
I just wanna know, I just gotta know
Do you wanna go? Baby, we could go
