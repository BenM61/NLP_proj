When you hear this sound a-comin'
Hear the drummer drumming
Won't you join together with the band
We don't move in any 'ticular direction
And we don't make no collections
Won't you join together with the band

Do you really think I care
What you eat or what you wear
Won't you join together with the band
There's a million ways to laugh
Ev'ry one's a path
Come on and join together with the band

Everybody join together
Won't you join together
Come on and join together with the band
We need to join together
Come on join together
Come on and join together with the band

You don't have to play
You can follow or lead the way
Oh won't you join together with the band
We don't know where we're going
But the season's right for knowing
Oh won't you join together with the band

It's the singer not the song
That makes the music move along
Oh won't you join together with the band
This is the biggest band you'll find
It's as deep as it is wide
Come on and join together with the band

Join together
(Ev'rybody come on) join together 
Join together with the band
Join together
(Ev'rybody come on) join together 
Join together with the band
