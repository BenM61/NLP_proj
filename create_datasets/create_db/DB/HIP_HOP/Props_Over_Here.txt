Showing love, with the fucking bass in your face 
New York City have mercy one time, introducing the crew 

[Fashion] 
Hey, you ain't really you and you ain't really down 
Plus I'm tired of seeing you fucking for they face of ground 
'Cause when I sit back and think back of how you found me 
It make me react react my fucking yammy 
Now I don't cock, though my mnd is in the sewer 
I just kick back six pack and then I do 'er 
But she gets stuck on crowing like a cat 
'Cause the toes got sucked on she don't know how to act 
Back in the days I am 237, used to rumble Kevin 
Backing hoes was like heaven 
Eleven, years later I tried to hide 
And hoped they pass me by like I'm the pharycyde 
Just let me puff and lounge with my niggas 
Don't have no time to fake funk with triggers 
Don't believe in kids with that puts cat say 
F*ck around with Fasion get your whole shit bit 
Spend crazy years with the blues pay dues 
Before I met the Psycho is in the junk yard juice 
But now the crew combined and we can't be stopped 
Going around the globe to collect the props

And when the night is through, I won't have a fucking clue 
Of what tomorrow will bring so I pay ten [true] 
Yo life's kind of funny if you don't make money 
Then your days ain't fuckin sunny 
Excuse me for my language 
But I'm trying to get my last thing together 
And bought the crib to be in my damn bids so never 
Acted like I deserve to have it 
I whipped I stabbed it I whipped I grabbed it you silly 
Rabbit, I'm coming at your door 
Tracks behind the stacks better yo I'm brought showa

Use a pistol drop dogging that shit you need to stop

And real niggas could lick their hoes in niggas backs 
And your life's down like a heavy price to pay 
For some bullshit that you ain't even had to say 
But don't sweat that, 'cause I'm 'ma let you keep your head

Taking care of business yeah without a doubt 
And I'm 'ma make a million dollars kid before I'm out

Going hand to hand gettin' loot on the corner
