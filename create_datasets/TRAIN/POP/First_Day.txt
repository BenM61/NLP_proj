Welcome to your new job
Hope you have a wonderful first day
We are so happy to have you join the team
You are so lucky on your first day
And they say

This is the job that people die for
I hope you're ready for the next stage
A lot of people work in the same place
Don't let them get in your way

Dinner time you go to the canteen
You make a new friend at the dinner break
You like to talk when you're eating
But today you listen to him

And he says like it or not
You have to do what they say
And it is something that you would like to talk about
But it's only your first day
And they say

This is the job that people die for
I hope you're ready for the next stage
A lot of people work in the same place
Don't let them get in your way

And they say faster, faster
It's time to take you to the next stage
But it's only your first day
And you're not ready for the next stage

And they say faster, faster
It's time to take you to the next stage
And it is something that you would like to talk about
But it's only your first day
(First day) you are so lucky on your first day (first day)
You feel so happy on your first day (first day)
You are so lucky on your first day (first day)

This is the job that people die for
I hope you're ready for the next stage
A lot of people work in the same place
Don't let them get in your way

Welcome to your new job (first day)
Hope you have a wonderful first day (first day)
We are so happy to have you join the team (first day)

(People die for people die for)
(People die for people die for)
(People die for people die for)
(People die for people die for)
