I used to dream and make believe
Everything so real
Holding future life
That's when we began
You help me understand
There's a life I don't know
And mine I can't let go
I couldn't if I tried-so I'm

Living through vicarious eyes
For times I wanted to know
You're a mirror of a life
That only heaven knows
Only heaven knows

I close my eyes to see behind
So many things so gray
I can't wait to relive the past
Of all the times in my life 
That came close to your life
But not quite the same-till then I'm

Living through vicarious eyes
For times I wanted to know
You're a mirror of a life
That only heaven knows
Only heaven knows

Feel the strength within you soul
I gave you all that you need
So when you leave me, don't forget me
Cause someday you'll need these eyes

When there's times of unknown
Cause there's another side of me
That you'll want to know
And when you see that other side
When we're together again
We'll both learn through the eyes
That only heaven knows
