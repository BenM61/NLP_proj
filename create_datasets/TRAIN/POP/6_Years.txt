I wait six years 
I wait six nights
Wind this rope 
A second chance

I call your name like in a trance
I'll run to you 
I would die for you
Divided hearts 

Divided soul
I'm burning in a flame of hope
I'll run to yo 
I would die for you

You can run 
You can hide
Love is like a lie
Can't you see?

I wait six years 
Six nights for you
I give my heart, my pride 
That's true

I'll wait 
I'll wait till I need you
I'll wait 
I'll wait my dreams come true

I wait six years 
Six nights for sure
I give my heart 
No fight before

I'll wait 
I'll wait down in the flame
I'll wait 
I'll wait see you again

I wait six years 
I wait six nights
A missing heart 
A lonely sky

Above the clouds 
I hear the cry
I'll run to you 
I would die for you

A friend you win 
A friend you lose
But baby take a broken fool
I'll run to you 

I would die for you
You can run 
You can hide

Love is like a lie
Can't you see?
Please forgive my heart
Please forgive my heart
