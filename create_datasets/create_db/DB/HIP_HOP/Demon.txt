Left us midway through
A cowardly way out
The alcoholic way
A loser there's no doubt
A weakling in disguise
He's 31 years old
Supported by his friends
He'll never leave his home

Guided by his peers
A follower at best
Success his only fear
He'll never lead the rest

His demon is his crutch
In life he has no clue
Consuming way to much
And acting like a fool

Left us midway through
A cowardly way out
The alcoholic way
A loser there's no doubt
A weakling in disguise

He's 31 years old
Supported by his friends
He'll never leave his home
