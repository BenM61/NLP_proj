This is my alphabet.
Because time goes on
and things are changing in my world
here is a new alphabet
for the children of my generation.
Of course all these words have a meaning for me
but other generations might find a different mood to their world.

My alphabet goes like this:

A stands for anything
and B for bionic and Bach
C stands for claustrophobia
and D for dirty old man
E stands for everyone
F is full frontal and friends
G of course, stands for getting a divorce
H now stands for hijacking
and I for a king size ego

J now stands for jukebox and junkies
K is for those who kiss and tell
and leading lady stars with L
Naturally M is for me
and N is for never again
O is for that famous story, mmm
and P for pain and poverty
Q stands for quality which is better than quantity
R stands for rock and roll fan
S is sexy and sad
T drives them totally mad
and U are everything to me
V stands for little voodoo
and W for where and when
X sounds extremely mysterious
Y is a question I keep asking
and Z dear child, for the zero you will get if you don't learn my alphabet.
