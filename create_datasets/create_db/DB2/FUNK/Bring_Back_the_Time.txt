Bring back the time
When you were mine
Children were laughing then
I could hear a bluebird sing

Bring back the time
I was finding you
And all your beauty
And all your charms
And the warmth of your arms
Oh the warmth of your arms

Bring back the time
When you were mine
And we were walking by the shore
Forever more
The world was ours
Sunshine, flowers, and you

Bring back the time
That summer day
You said you'd marry me
Now I cry but can't you see
These teardrops in my eyes
Aren't just for you
They're for all we planned
Our whole lives through
Things we'll never do
Things we'll never do

Bring back the time
When you were mine
I wish I could bring back the time
