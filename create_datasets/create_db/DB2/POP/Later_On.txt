That boy behind the curtain was no one that I trusted
I didn't like his face I didn't think he was cute
But I kissed him just to get some information
I used my body and his desperation

We jumped up out of there, yeah we were chased
And I'm telling you that that time was a scary place
But I would do it all again the same yeah,
I would do it all again the same

And later on I'll cry my stupid eyes out
Later on I'm crying like a baby
And yeah baby don't get so disappoint
I am not what you anticipated
Later on I'll cry my stupid eyes out
Later on I'm crying like a baby
And yeah baby don't get so disappoint
I am not what you anticipated

I wish that I did not make the decisions
I'll never get back in to that
I ripped my hair out of my package
Cause I felt bad
I let him down
I didn't mean to make him sad

And later on I'll cry my stupid eyes out
Later on I'm crying like a baby
And yeah baby don't get so disappoint
I am not what you anticipated
Later on I'll cry my stupid eyes out
Later on I'm crying like a baby
And yeah baby don't get so disappoint
I am not what you anticipated

And later on I'll cry my stupid eyes out
Later on I'm crying like a baby
And yeah baby don't get so disappoint
I am not what you anticipated
Later on I'll cry my stupid eyes out
Later on I'm crying like a baby
And yeah baby don't get so disappoint
I am not what you anticipated

I am not what you anticipated
