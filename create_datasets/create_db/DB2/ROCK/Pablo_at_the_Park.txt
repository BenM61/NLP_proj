Fading in the afterglow
I wrinkle in my mind another fear
With ears beside the bedroom door
I close my eyes to keep inside the tears
The question of its worth won't iron out
It's tearing at the very thing I feel

I'm still Pablo at the park
Where's my Gloria when it's hard
How my mind has changed so much
But my heart's the same

He loves and then he hurts some more
It takes a generous man to lose something
Will I know what it means to see the pain through different eyes?
But nothing seems to work this time
I'll live inside the burden till I've healed

I'm still Pablo at the park
I'll find Gloria when it's hard
How my mind has changed so much
But my heart's the same

But nothing seems to work this time
I'm still Pablo at the park
And I've got Gloria when it's hard
How my mind has changed so much
But I'm still Pablo
I'm still Pablo
