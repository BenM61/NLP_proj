I, touch the sky, all around, it's alright
And oh you wouldn't believe
What's happening to me
Expectations all around
My intuition knows no doubt I could
Lose my way on this merry-go-round

So I, like a bird will fly
To the sea
Just what could it be
And patience I will learn
Before this fire burns
Intuition's got a hold on me
There's magic in the air
I want to breathe
Change, change all around
Go with the rhythm

The soul sound (oh mm)
The soul sound (mm, mm)
The soul sound (oh mm)
The soul sound

So I, like a bird will fly
To the sea
Just what could it be
(What could it be yeah)
Patience I will learn
Before this fire burns
Intuition's got a hold on me
There's magic in the air
I want to breathe
Change, change all around
Just go with the rhythm

The soul sound (oh mm)
The soul sound (mm, mm)
The soul sound (feeling free)
The soul sound

Dun-duna, duna-duna, dun-duna, ooh
Sould sound
Dun-duna, dun-duna, dun-duna, dunn
Wait a minute soul sound
Ah, ooh ah, ooh ah, ooh ah

The soul sound (oh mm)
The soul sound (mm, mm)
The soul sound (mm, mm)
The soul sound (mm, mm)
The soul sound (wait a minute soul sound)
