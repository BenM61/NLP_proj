Now the sea eats the sky
But they say it's a lie
And there's no birds left to fly
We'll hide out

Oh, the weather is against us
Houses on the ground
And flowers upside down
In our dreams

In the eye of the storm
In the land where you were born
We try to make no sound
We hide out

'Cause they watch us in sleep
And the language that we speak
And the secrets that we keep
In our dreams
In our dreams
In our dreams

In our dreams
In our dreams
In our dreams

I said I'm so sorry
To have kept you waiting around
I wish I could've come up
I could've shouted out loud
But they got exits covered
All the exits underground
I wish I could figure it out
But the world's upside down

In a world upside down

Oh, to dream this all off
In the islands of the mind
The places they can't find
We'll hide out

And the black sky came down
And the cities underground
The flowers upside down
In our dreams

Oh, to meet you again
To pass you on the stairs
To see you everywhere
In my dreams

'Cause they watch us in sleep
And the language that we speak
And the secrets that we keep to ourselves
In our dreams
In our dreams

In our dreams
In our dreams
In our dreams

I said I'm so sorry
To have kept you waiting around
I wish I could've come up
I could've shouted out loud
But they got exits covered
All the exits underground
I wish I could figure it out
But the world's upside down

I said I'm so sorry
That the world has fallen down
I wish I could do something more
I could shout it out loud
They got exits covered
All the exits underground
I wish I could figure it out
But the world's upside down

In a world upside down

(Up)
(Upside down, oh)
(Upside down, oh)
(Upside down, oh)

That two days of your (?) while you're on summer
I hope you found our horror to discover
We should always scream (?) with each other
That two days of your (?) while you're on summer
I hope you found our horror to discover
We should always scream (?) with each other
That two days of your (?) while you're on summer
