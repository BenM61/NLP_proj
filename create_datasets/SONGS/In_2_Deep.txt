Everybody scatter
There's a madman on the run
Stumblin' through the wreckage
Like a blind man with a gun

Nowhere to hide
I'm in too deep
Can't see the light
'Cause I'm in too deep

Over my head
Caught up in a hurricane
That never seems to end
Hard to know the devil

When he looks like your best friend
Nowhere to hide
I'm in too deep
Can't see the light

'Cause I'm in too deep
Over my head
Oh... I should have known
But I can't let go

'Cause I'm in too deep
Over my head
Oh... someone call somebody
The asylum's under siege

Inmates took a hostage
I'll be damned if it's not me
Nowhere to hide
'Cause I'm in too deep

Bury the light
'Cause I'm in too deep
Can't see the light
In too deep

Bury the light
I'm in too deep
I'm over my head
Over my head
