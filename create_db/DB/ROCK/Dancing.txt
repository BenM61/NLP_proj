It's nineteen thirty-three
???
???
But she just wanna go

Dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing

She walk the street by day
There's people all around
But she don't worry 'bout that
Cause she was gone downtown

She's going dancing, dancing
Making the noise
And dancing, dancing
Girls and the boys
Dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing

???
Sweet mother Germany
Come to the cabaret
Don't worry about history, history, history

Dancing, dancing
Girls and the boys
Dancing, dancing
Making the noise
And dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing

It's nineteen thirty-eight
Sweet mother Germany
It's seems so far away
And she will never be, never be, never be

Dancing, dancing
The girls and the boys
Dancing, dancing
Making the noise
And dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing, dancing,
Never again, never again,
Never again, never again,
Never never never again
Never never never again
Never never never again
Never never never again
Never never never again
Never
