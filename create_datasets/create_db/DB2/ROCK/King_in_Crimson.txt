In the darkness, the raven's head
In the courtyard clothed in fear
I see gates that are opening
There's only one way out of here

Daylight has come
The night has come

See his twisted sons and daughters
Writhing slowly in Satan's mire
If you only could see the visions
The trembling world I now despise

As the veil reveals the outer darkness
I am sucked into the walls of flame

Arise, awake

The King in Crimson comes

Arise awake

The King in Crimson, crimson comes
He knows the weakness that you can't fight
The stone of night that weighs you down
If only you could see the visions
His hand is death if you take it now

As you scream into the web of silence
There is nothing that can save you now

Arise, awake

The King in Crimson comes

Arise, awake

The King in Crimson comes

Arise, awake

The King in Crimson comes

Arise, awake

The King in Crimson, crimson comes
As you scream into the web of silence
There is nothing that can save you now

Arise, awake

The King in Crimson comes

Arise, awake

The King in Crimson comes

Arise, awake

The King in Crimson, crimson comes

To your window he comes

At your window I come
