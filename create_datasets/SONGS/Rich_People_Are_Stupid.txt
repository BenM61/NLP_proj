My friend is an expert, he's always on time
Researching volcanoes and blowing my mind

On my way to work on Sunday morning, I feel mighty fine
Oh, rich people are stupid
Rich people are stupid
And I feel mighty fine

Bourgeoisie morning, breakfast at ten
You don't like your coffee? Guess I'll make it again

On my way to work on Sunday morning, I feel mighty fine
Oh, rich people are stupid
Rich people are stupid
And I feel mighty fine

On my way to work on Sunday morning, I feel mighty fine
Rich people are stupid
Rich people are stupid
And I feel mighty fine

Oh-oh! Two, three, four
Woo-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Shut up!
