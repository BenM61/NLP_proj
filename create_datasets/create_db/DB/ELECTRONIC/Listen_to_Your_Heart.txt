You can see in my eyes 
That I was keeping my feelings inside 
Should I be telling everybody 
I don't know what to do 

Are there the signs to recognize 
Or has someone been telling me lies 
I should never let a rumor 
Change my point of view 

It's just that I'm afraid that I could be 
Falling in love too soon 

Just listen to your heart that's what they say 
Listen to your heart you'll be okay 
Listen to your heart 
Listen to your heart 

Somewhere there's a truth you can't deny 
That life is too short for goodbye 
If I always let my heart 
Control what's in my mind 

It's just that I'm afraid maybe one day 
Of breaking this heart of mine 

Just listen to your heart that's what they say 
Listen to your heart you'll be okay 
Listen to your heart 
Listen to your heart 

Just listen to your heart and you will find 
All your hopes and fears will turn out fine 
Listen to your heart 
Listen to your heart 

It's just that I'm afraid that I could be 
Falling in love too soon 

Just listen to your heart that's what they say 
Listen to your heart you'll be okay 
Listen to your heart 
Listen to your heart 

Just listen to your heart and you will find 
All your hopes and fears will turn out fine 
Listen to your heart 
Listen to your heart 

Just listen to your heart that's what they say 
Listen to your heart you'll be okay 
Listen to your heart 
Listen to your heart
