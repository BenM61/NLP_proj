Ever seen a blind man cross the road
trying to make the other side
Ever seen a young girl growing old
trying to make herself a bride
So what becomes of you my love
When they have finally stripped you of
The handbags and the gladrags
That your Grandad had to sweat so you could buy
Baby
Once I was a young man
and all I thought I had to do was smile
You are still a young girl
and you bought everything in style
Listen
But once you think you're in you're out
cause you don't mean a single thing without
the handbags and the gladrags
that your Grandad had to sweat so you could buy
Sing a song of six-pence for your sake
And take a bottle full of rye
Four and twenty blackbirds in a cake
And bake them all in a pie
They told me you missed school today
So what I suggest you just throw them all away
the handbags and the gladrags
that your poor old Granddad had to sweat to buy
They told me you missed school today
So I suggest you just throw them all away
the handbags and the gladrags
that your poor old Granddad had to sweat to buy ya
