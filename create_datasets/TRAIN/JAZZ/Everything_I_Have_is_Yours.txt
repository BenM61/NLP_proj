The more I'm with you
The more I can see
My love is yours alone
You came and captured 
A heart that was free
Now there's nothing I can call my own

Everything I have is yours, you're part of me
Everything I have is yours, my destiny
I would gladly give the sun to you
If the sun were only mine
I would gladly give the earth to you
And the stars that shine

Everything that I possess, I offer you
That my dream of happiness come true
I'd be happy just to spend my life
Waiting at your beck and call
Everything I have is yours
My life, my all

Everything that I possess, I offer you
That my dream of happiness come true
I'd be happy just to spend my life
Waiting at your beck and call
Everything I have is yours
My life, my all
