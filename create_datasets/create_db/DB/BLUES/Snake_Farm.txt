Well a woman now I love is named Ramona
She kinda looks like tempest storm
She can dance like little Egypt
She works down at the snake farm

Snake farm, it just sounds nasty
Snake farm, it pretty much is
Snake farm, it's a reptile house
Snake farm, ugh

Ramona's got a keen sense of humor
She got a tattoo down her arm
It's of a python eatin' a little mouse 
Wearin' a sailor hat that says snake farm

Snake farm, it just sounds nasty
Snake farm,it  pretty much is
Snake farm, it's a reptile house
Snake farm, ugh

I asked Ramona how come she works there
She says "well, it's got it's charms
There's nothing to do in the winter
Now and then some kid gets bit at the snake farm"

Snake farm, it just sounds nasty
Snake farm, it pretty much is
Snake farm, it's a reptile house
Snake farm, ugh

Well, Ramona likes her malt liquor
And a band from Wales that's called The Alarm
She said she cried when they broke up
She still plays their records at the snake farm

Snake farm, it just sounds nasty
Snake farm, it pretty much is
Snake farm, it's a reptile house
Snake farm, ugh

Sometimes Ramona calls me up 
And says come on down here, it's getting warm
She runs everybody off
And we you know, it's a snake farm

Snake farm, it just sounds nasty
Snake farm, it pretty much is
Snake farm, it's a reptile house
Snake farm, ugh

Snake farm, it just sounds nasty
Snake farm, it pretty much is
Snake farm, it's a reptile house
Snake farm, ugh
