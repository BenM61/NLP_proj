I don't mean up you wait
then you don't call for days
I don't mean up to be too late
then you don't come to me.

How many times you're gonna let me down
you keep it from me hanging all that scene
wrapped around and clingered.
Never believed that I'd ever find myself
Looking up to the upper heading
Loving every minute babe!

I'll mind, I ain't gonna give up the song inside.
Don't mind, I'll mind
I don't want to quit after all this time.

I'll mind, I ain't gonna give up the song inside.
Don't mind, I'll mind
I don't want to quit after all this time.

Totally lost the way you came rainbow color day.
Open up the way you changed
then it all starts to fade.

How many times you're gonna let me down
you keep it from me hanging all that scene
wrapped around and clingered
Never believed that I'd ever find myself
Looking up to the upper heading 
Loving every minute babe!

I'll mind, I ain't gonna give up the song inside.
Don't mind, I'll mind
I don't want to quit after all this time.

I'll mind, I ain't gonna give up the song inside.
Don't mind, I'll mind
I don't want to quit after all this time.

How many times you're gonna let me down
you keep it from me hanging all that scene
wrapped around and clingered.
Never believed that I'd ever find myself
looking up to the upper heading
loving every minute babe!

I'll mind I ain't gonna give up the song inside.
Don't mind I'll mind
I don't want to quit after all this time.

I won't mind. I ain't gonna stop the song inside
even if you stop the song inside
I don't want to quit after all this time
