All the people walking in a straight line
Turn around and you're caught up in the crossfire
Never knowing when you're going, so we go with the flow

And words burn as they travel through the grapevine
And some rebels got to get it in their own time
Breaking down, so alone, getting ready to go

So if you know where you're going
Then I'll follow where you lead
I'm on the darkest road to nowhere
And you're the better part of me

Send me your love
Send me your love
Send me your love
Send me your love

Send me your love

Send me your love
Send me your love
Send me your love
Send me your love

Out of line and you're standing in formation
Last train and it's leaving from the station
Never knowing when you're going, it's the luck of the draw

Day breaking in a million little pieces
Time is flying and it's dying when it freezes
It's getting cold out on the edge and I'm ready to fall

Do you know where I've been hiding?
I'm a broken refugee
And while the world is out there fighting, 
There's nothing left here to believe

So if you know where you're going
Then I'll follow where you lead
I'm on the darkest road to nowhere
And you're the better part of me

Send me your love

Send me your love

Send me your love
Send me your love
Send me your love
Send me your love
