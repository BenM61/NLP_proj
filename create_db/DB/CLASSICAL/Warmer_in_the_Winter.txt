PJs with fuzzy socks
Ugly sweaters with polkadots
Warm cookies, had my fill
A [?] to help with the chill
Hot cocoa, piping hot
Snuggled up in our favorite spot
Whisper things we shouldn't say
And I don't plan on leaving here til Christmas Day

Windows frosted
Summer's sleeping
But I don't really mind

I know that it's cold outside
The world is bundled up in white
I just need you by my side
'Cause I'm warmer in the winter with you
'Cause I'm warmer in the winter with you

Last year I was on my own
Hibernating in my empty home
Santa didn't even help
I left a plate of cookies
But I ate them myself
This year feels so brand new
Tie a ribbon around me and you
Santa is checking twice
He's trying to figure out if we're naughty or nice

Roads are closed
Snow is falling
But I don't really mind

I know that it's cold outside
The world is bundled up in white
I just need you by my side
'Cause I'm warmer in the winter with you

I know that it's cold outside
The world is bundled up in white
I just need you by my side
'Cause I'm warmer in the winter with you
The temperature is toasty for two
I'm warmer in the winter with you
