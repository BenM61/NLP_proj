(Tell me that you want me)
Don't ask me
I want to teach you a lesson
Yes, Aaron, honey
Let me tell you something, baby

(Let me let you love me)
The real romance
The one you get
From the sunshine, okay

Sex potion, attention
Scent of attraction
So mister, mention
What's the position

Tell me your story
I'll tell you my version
You are American
I'm a Jamaican

Me now will show you
Where the right sex comes from
Said it's a potion
It's a love potion

You give me some action
Where I want it
On top of the ocean

(Tell me that you want me)
See you in my bedroom tonight
(I can tell the way you touch me)
Yes, come touch me now, touch me now

(Let me let you love me)
See you in my bedroom tonight
(through the smoke in the room
I smell your scent of attraction)

Patra, ooh, sexy, I want you
I know you want me too
I can see it in your eyes
No need to deny

I can see you grinding, baby
You can't stop moving, my lady
Because I'm right behind you
Doing everything that you do

(Tell me that you want me)
See you in my bedroom tonight
(I can tell the way you touch me)
Yes, come touch me now, touch me now

(Let me let you love me)
See you in my bedroom tonight
(Through the smoke in the room
I smell your scent of attraction)

Tell me that you want me
(Take it easy, mon, easy, mon)
Tell me, baby, baby, ooh
(Yes, come touch me now, touch me now)

See you in my bedroom tonight
