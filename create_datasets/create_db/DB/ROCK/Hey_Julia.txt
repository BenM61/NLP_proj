Hey, hey Julia, you're acting so peculiar 
I know I'd never fool you in a million years
A horn section you resemble and your figure makes me tremble 
And I sure would like to handle what's between your ears
You're a temptation to a man
I could not resist you and I won't if I can
You're so unexpected and whatever you injected made me feel how I felt when I sang

Hey, hey Julia you're acting so peculiar 
I know I'd never fool you in a million years
You're a strain on my eyes and you're full of surprises
Love materializes soon as you come near.
There's a sensation you create, 
Robs me of my sleep and I've forgotten the date
My head started spinning soon as you started singing
And like a fish I just rose to the bait.

Hey, hey Julia with your crazy sense of humor
You turn fact into rumor soon as you come near
A horn section you resemble and your figure makes me tremble 
And I sure would like to handle what's between your ears
You're a temptation to a man
I could not resist you and I won't if I can.
You're so unexpected and whatever you injected made me feel how I felt when I sang
Julia, you're a danger just like giving sweets to strangers 
And I think it's time I took you in hand.
