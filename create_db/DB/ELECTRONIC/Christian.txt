This is emotion
Emotion less war
A torn shirt and a long dead cause
I can't sleep
This kind of thing gets me down
Don't say walk
I may lose my fear

I could lose myself
In this honesty

I read all sorts of things
There's so much to learn
I've seen the hand that rushes in
As it rush over you

I could lose myself
In this honesty
