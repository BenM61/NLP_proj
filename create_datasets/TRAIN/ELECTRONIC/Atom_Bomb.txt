Baby' got an atom bomb
A mother fuckin' atom bomb
Twenty two mega tonne
I ain't ever seen so much fun
Baby got a poison gas
Baby got a heart attack
Baby got a pain on tap
Baby gimme some of that
Baby got a satellite
Baby got second sight
Baby got a master plan
A foolproof master plan
Baby got purple hair
Baby got a secret lair
Baby got an army there
I ain't ever seen baby scared
Baby got a Nobel prize
Given for the perfect crime
Baby got an alibi
Baby got eight more lives
Baby got a crystal ball
Baby doesn't care at all
Baby's having too much fun
She's got a shit kickin' mother fuckin' atom bomb
Baby got a fleet at sea
And a submarine called emergency
She got a motorcade
She got a monorail
Going coat to coast on a campaign trail
Playing deck of cards in an armored car
She got a kung fu star as a body guard
She got a juju charm
She got a magic spell
She got a genie
All three is working well
She got a TV show
She got a shopping mall
She got a miracle
She doesn't want at all
She got a monument and at a great expense
She got a head of state and a president
She got destiny
She got supremacy
She got everything from a-z
She got it all down tight
She got nothing wrong
She got the whole wide world singing baby's song
