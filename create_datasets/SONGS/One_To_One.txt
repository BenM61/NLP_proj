Tried to call you yesterday
But you were at the Monday Club
Or a Communist demonstration
Who cares

You're going somewere everyday
Vegetarians against the Klan
Every Woman Against Every Man
Never

One to One
What's wrong
What's wrong with one to one
Just once

Just me and you
'Cause one to one is real
And you can't hide, just feel
That three's a crowd

I agree with what you say
But I don't want to wear a badge
I don't want to wave a banner like you
Though I don't mind it if you do

You're beautiful when you get mad
Or is that a sexist observation
Or
One to One

What's wrong
What's wrong with one to one
Just once
Just me and you

'Cause one to one is real
And you can't hide, just feel
That three's a crowd
