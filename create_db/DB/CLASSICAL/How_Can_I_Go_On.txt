When all the salt is taken from the sea
I stand dethroned, I'm naked and I bleed
But when your finger points so savagely
Is anybody there to believe in me
To hear my plea and take care of me?

How can I go on, from day to day
Who can make me strong in every way
Where can I be safe, where can I belong
In this great big world of sadness
How can I forget those beautiful dreams that we shared
They're lost and they're nowhere to be found
How can I go on?

Sometimes I seem to tremble in the dark, I cannot see
When people frighten me
I try to hide myself so far from the crowd
Is anybody there to comfort me
Lord, take care of me

How can I go on (how can I go on)
From day to day (from day to day)
Who can make me strong (who can make me strong)
In every way (in every way)
Where can f be safe (where can I be safe)
Where can I belong (where can I belong)
In this great big world of sadness
(In this great big world of sadness)
How can I forget (how can I forget)
Those beautiful dreams that we shared
(Those beautiful dreams that we shared)
They're lost and they're nowhere to be found
How can I go on?

How can I go on? How can I go on? Go on, go on, go on
