You say, "I love You"
And make a promise
So many words are spoken
You ride on feeling
A short devotion
And leave a heart so broken

Love has a name
Love has a face
And when you know love
You know you're not the same
Love never dies
Love never leaves
And when hope is gone
Love will believe
Love every day
Gives me away
Love has a name

You want to fly now
High on emotion
It's like walking on the ceiling
Love isn't blind now
It sees and knows how
To go beyond a feeling

Love has a name
Love has a face
And when you know love
You know you're not the same
Love never dies
Love never leaves
And when hope is gone
Love will believe
Love every day
Gives me away
Love has a name

Love came from Heaven
And died for us all
Now we are forgiven
By the Savior of the world
The Savior of the world

Love has a name
Love has a face
And when you know love
You know you're not the same
Love never dies
Love never leaves
And when hope is gone
Love will believe
Love every day
Gives me away
Love has a name

Love has a Name
Jesus
