Across the river a good woman cried
All because a foolish man had lied
She gave up all she had to show how much she cared
But the man told so many lies, now another man is over there

That woman across the river
Sweet woman across the river, she was mine

Word got around that he had jilted her
And men came running came running from near and far
How could I be such a fool, I'll never, never, never know
That the man, he's got to know, he's a lucky so and so

That woman across the river
I met her one day, about a week ago
She said, "I don't even want to talk to you
'Cause I don't love you any more"

That woman across the river
