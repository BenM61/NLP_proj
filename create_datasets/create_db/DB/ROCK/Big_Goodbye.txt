Hey, hey, baby
No more lies
Hey, hey, baby
This is the big goodbye

Remember baby
Dreams we shared
We ran with crazies
Lived on solid air

Do you remember lady
Who you used to be
Did you become the stranger
Baby you or me

I guess you were just tryin'
To keep a love alive
But baby all your lyin'
Just took it for a ride

Huh huh!

A man of constant sorrow
Under an evil eye
Oh baby when it's over
The truth is first to die

Oh I believe in magic
Fire that binds a band
Baby there's no magic
In hidin' sleight of hand

I guess that I was tryin'
To keep myself alive
But then there's no denyin'
I was losin' all my pride

Hey, hey, baby
No more lies
Hey, hey, baby
This is the big goodbye

I guess you were just tryin'
To buy some piece of mind
But baby there's no buyin'
Eyesight for the blind
