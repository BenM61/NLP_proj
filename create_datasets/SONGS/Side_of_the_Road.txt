It's just one (one)
One is all I need
Let her swing (swing) 
Then bend her knees

I can look ripped as you
Love to look beautiful, love

But this one (one)
Is all I ever need

Just can't give you up
I just can't give you up
Just can't give you up

Won't turn away
Won't feel a thing
Oh, man
Side of the road, baby

Falter to see, I do believe what the soldiers say
I do believe, you silly goose
Young girl, side of the road, baby

No need to wait
No need to wait
Mr. suit and tie

When she's gone, 
I'm crouching on my knees
It must be fun, and fun is all I need

I can look ripped as you
Love to look beautiful, love

Just this one (one)
Is all I ever need

Just can't give you up
I just can't give you up
Just can't give you up

Won't turn away
Won't feel a thing
Oh, man
Side of the road, baby

Falter to see, I do believe what the soldiers say
I do believe, you silly goose
Young girl, side of the road, baby

No need to wait
No need to wait
Mr. suit and tie

Suit and tie
Awkward all the time
Young girl at the side dancin'
Higher than me
At the side of the road

At the side of the road
At the side of the road
At the side of the road
At the side of the road
