T'was a silent night
A midnight clear
Was no Santa Claus
No reindeer.
Only me and you
A love brand new
We fell in love at Christmas
It wasn't Valentine's Day
Or the first day of spring,
Summertime may be fine
But love didn't find me.
Till the snow began to fall
That's when everything changed
Cause that's when I found you.
I remember when holidays were blue
Shopping trips, money spent.
Every year de'ja vu
But now I reminisce on a special gift
In you I found it happened one silent night.
Just one year ago when your love found me
Now my life has changed and it's amazing
Cause I prayed for something special to come
But I never dreamed it would be your love.
