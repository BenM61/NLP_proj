Falling in and out of time
Falling in and out of line
You would always laugh at me
As I came up for air

Just a little boy
Leaning on the corner of the window pane
Watching the falling rain
Would it ever be safe to go out again

Sad sad rain
Sad sad rain
Sad sad rain

Making silly faces at the postman
Waiting for the lights to change
He's thinking of another place
As the rain beads upon his face
Grandma's in the kitchen
Calls the postman out of the rain
Invites him for a cup of tea
It's always them and me

Sad sad rain
Sad sad rain
Sad sad rain
Raining down on me again

Sad sad rain
Sad sad rain
Sad sad rain

Next stop is a lonely place
And I don't want to go
Inside is the only place
To let my feelings show

Sad rain
Sad sad rain
Sad sad rain
Sad sad rain
Raining down on me again

Sad sad rain
Raining down on me again
Sad sad rain
Raining down on me again

Sad sad rain
Raining down on me
Sad sad rain
Sad rain
Sad sad rain
Sad rain
Sad sad rain
Sad rain

Falling in and out of time
Falling in and out of line
And you would always laugh at me
