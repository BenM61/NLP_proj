I don't need no money, I've got lucky oil on my hands
I don't need no woman's voice, always raisin' sand
When I been drinking, yeah, when I been drinking
Now, when I come home, baby, please let me lay down and rest

I'm looking for a woman that ain't never been kissed
Maybe, we can get along and I won't have to use my fist
When I been drinking, yeah, when I been drinking
Now, when I come home, baby, please let me lay down and rest

I want a job to go to work at twelve, get off at one
Have an hour for dinner, boys and my day's work be done
When I been drinking, yeah, when I been drinking
Now, when I come home, baby, please let me lay down and rest

I want somebody to pet me an' feed me in the bed
Talk baby, talk to me girl, when you go to comb my hair
When I been drinking, yeah, when I been drinking
Now when I come home, baby, please let me lay down and rest

I want to be taken out of the bed, baby, put in a wheel chair
Roll me anywhere now, baby, Big Bill won't care, girl
When he been drinking, yeah, when I been drinking
Now when I come home, baby, please let me lay down and rest
