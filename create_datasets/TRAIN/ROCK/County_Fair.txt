(Kimya:)
Walking
Along
I'm in this song
That belongs
Does it belong
Yeah
In
My
Head
Baby do you love me?
I don't even love me
Baby look above me
Baby please don't shove me
Baby if you spoon me
I will let you moon me
Yeah!
Thinking aloud
In a crowd
Feeling Proud
Should I feel Proud?
Yeah
I'm
Not
Dead
Baby do you love me?
I don't even love me
Baby look above me
Baby please don't shove me
Baby if you spoon me
I will let you moon me
Yeah!

(Adam:)
Making myself sick
In my face a floppy disk
Getting dumber by the day
Never got no time to play
Should I feel bad to tell the truth
Sitting sideways on my chair
Pencils in your hair
Make you so spunkified

Take me to the county fair
Tons and tons of things are there
Take me on a rollercoaster
Yeah

I could race a car
Through a tunnel in my yard
Make these hills too steep to climb
So much steeper in my mind
Should I feel bad
Cause now I know
How to stay but still I go
I'm confused
And now you look so spunkified

Take me to the county fair
Tons and tons of things are there
Take me on a rollercoaster
Yeah
