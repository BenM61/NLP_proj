I drank from this cup
'Till it watered down my soul
I need you so I'll thirst no more

I started down this path such a long long time ago
I need to find my way home

I want to be the one that holds you high
I want to be the one that brings you praise

I'm the king of my desires
I've tried them all a thousand times
I have got to choose between this world and you

It's got a grip I must admit
I can't explain this emptiness
I hurt without you by my side

I've cried to you in my darkest hour
And you brought my soul up from the grave
