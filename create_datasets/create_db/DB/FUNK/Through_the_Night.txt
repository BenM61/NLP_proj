I'm so nervous, don't know what I'm supposed to do,
Don't know what I'm supposed to say,
I love you.

I'm so anxious, you don't know what I'm going through,
Don't know why I'm so afraid.
I love you.

Through the night, through the night dear
Through the night, through the night dear
You don't see the love within my eyes,
Every night, every night you're creeping through my dreams and I need more.
You had us fooled, as skies, I love you

Feel so breathless, as you dance around my mind,
The thought of you sends me so high.
I love you.

Through the night, through the night dear 
Through the night, through the night dear
You don't see the love within my eyes,
Through the night, through the night dear
Through the night, gonna loose my nerve or loose my mind

Every night, every night your creeping through my dreams and I need more.
You had us fooled, as skies, I love you
Through the night,
You don't see the love.

Through the night, through the night.

Every night every night you're creeping through my dreams and I need more
I love you.
