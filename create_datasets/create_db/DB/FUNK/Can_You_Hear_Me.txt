Once we were lovers, can they understand? 
Closer than others I was your, I was your man
Don't talk of heartaches, oh, I remember them all
When I'm checking you out one day, to see if I'm
Faking it all

Can you hear me? 
Can you feel me inside? 
Show your love, love
Take it in right (take it in right)
Take it in right (take it in right)

There's been many others (oh) so many times
Sixty new cities an' what do I, what do I
What do I find? 
I want love so badly, I want you most of all
You know it's harder to take it from anyone
It's harder to fall
Can you hear me call? 

Well, can you hear me (yeah)
Can you feel me inside? 
Show your love, love

Take it in right (take it in right)
Take it in right (take it in right)

Can you hear me? 
Can you feel me inside? (I do)
Show your love, show your sweet, sweet love (love, love)
Show me your love
Take it in right (take it in right)
Take it in right (take it in right)

Take it in right to your love life, baby
Take it in right, to your love life
Take it in right, take it in right, right to your love life
Take it in right, ah (why don't you take it)
Take it in, take it in right
Right down, right down
(Why don't you take it) 
Why don't you take it? 
(Right to your heart)
Can you hear me? 
(Why don't you take it) can you feel me? 
(Why don't you take it) can you, take it in right
(Why don't you take it) right down, right down
(Right to your heart) can you take it, feel me (why don't you take it)
Down, to right down (why don't you take it) to your heart
(Why don't you take it) to your heart
(Right to your heart) take it down, take it down
Why don't you take it
Why don't you take it? 
Take it in right
(Right to your heart)
