It's just searching for the new hype
But reading it is like smokin' Marlboro Light
They try to set their trends with boring student-bands
Spex is a fat bitch! 

They tell you who's cool and they tell you who's the fool
It's forcing you upon the right opinion and ev'ry airhead
Believes
In trendy fashion scene plans
Spex is a fat bitch! 

The concept is too simple, too sceny boring simple
The writers eating cat's-food
Supporting industries, who try to kill our politics and
Say we are fanatics
Spex is a fat bitch! 

It's just searching for the new hype
But reading it is like fuckin' Michael Stipe
They try to set their trends with boring student-bands
Spex is a fat bitch!
