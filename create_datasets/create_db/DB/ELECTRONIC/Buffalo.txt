Looking for the one to blame is tough
Doesn't matter what you're talking about
She's gonna keep calling your bluff
We're not the only ones doing this
You see the buffalo
Just another one in the road
We laugh about it in his face
Caught between the rock and the other place
I know how this goes
It's always gonna be the boy who gives
It's always gonna be the girl to please
Did you get anything?
I'll see

'Cause you love it all
'Cause you'll find a way to keep on

He doesn't seem to get the joke
He's turning yellow, as a yolk
Someone took away his microphone
Pushed him off the stage 'til he's on his own
Can't feel a thing when he takes a shot
Ends up taking three right to the eyes
Cash in when the time is right
Can't stop by if he ever stops
Get down from there, or fall
Don't make us wait, too long

'Cause you love it all
'Cause you'll find a way to keep on

'Cause you love it all
'Cause you'll find a way to keep on

'Cause you love it all
'Cause you'll find a way to keep on
