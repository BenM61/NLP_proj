All the world is a room and the room is painted blue
You look at me and I look at you
We need our song to pull us through
But the melody is changing and the words all slip away

And we cannot sing our good old song
Like we could in the good old days

This leavin' you sure ain't easy
I think of the summer nights we knew
I remember the way you used to please me
But the time has come us now to go our separate ways

'Cause we cannot sing our good old song
Like we could in the good old days

Don't you wanna have your chance?
Don't you wanna try a new romance?
Oh, and I know you will when the time is right
And you will dance on the highest hill in the night

Tonight I want to hold you close
I wanna feel you near me one more time
It's too bad it's sad but that's, it's how it goes
And when your friends all come an ask you
Why your lover went away?
 
Just say that we could not sing our good old song
Like we could in the good old days
Like we could in the good old days

Oh, we could not sing our good old song
Like we could in the good old days

We couldn't make it, no
No, we couldn't take it any more

We could not sing our good old song
Like we could in the good old days
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

We could not sing our good old song
Like we could in the good old days
Couldn't take the time couldn't make it right
