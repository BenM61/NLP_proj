Do I look like I'm fakin' with you?

(And I) would get me to you
(And I) just wanted from you
(And I) was not out to please you
(And I) could show you I'm true
(If I) gave my world to you
(If I) showed you how I do
(If I) made your words untrue
(If I) tell you I need you
(If I) set my heart for you
(If I) can't live without you
(If I) can't sleep without you
Would you know I'm feelin you?

If you would just hear what I say
(If you) would just look my way
(If you) would not turn away
(If you) would see I don't play
(If you) just listen to me
(If you) knew what I can be
(If you) would play into me
(If you) were open to me
(Then you) would see what I'm 'bout
(Then you) know how I get down
