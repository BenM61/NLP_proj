Now once there lived an old man with a very crooked nose
He lived in log hut and they called him Old Man Mose, yeah
Early one mornin' I knocked at his door
Didn't hear a single sound; I ain't gonna do it no more

'Cause I believe Old Man, I believe Old Man
I believe Old Man, that Old Man Mose is dead
I'm tellin' you, I believe Old Man, I believe Old Man
I do believe Old Man, that Old Man Mose is dead

Now, we believe Mose kicked the bucket
We believe Mose kicked the bucket
We believe Mose kicked the bucket
We believe he's dead; oh, we believe

We believe Mose kicked the bucket
We believe Mose kicked the bucket
We believe Mose kicked the bucket
We believe he's dead; I'm lookin' here

I went around to the side and I peeped through the crack
I saw an old man layin' flat on his back, yeah
If Old Man Mose was dead asleep, I did not know
But after lookin' through that window, I ain't gonna do that no more

'Cause I found out Old Man, I found out Old Man
I found out Old Man, that Old Man Mose is dead
I'm tellin' you I found out Old Man, what it's all about, Old Man
I found out Old Man, that Old Man Mose is dead

Now, we found out Mose kicked the bucket
We found out Mose kicked the bucket
We found out Mose kicked the bucket
We found out he's dead, oh

We found out Mose kicked the bucket
We found out Mose kicked the bucket
We found out Mose kicked the bucket
We found out he's dead

Old Man Mose is dead
