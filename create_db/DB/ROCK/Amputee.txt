This king of overstatement now 
Would like to whisper 
A sweet something in your ear all day 
From now till then 
I can't swim for liars on my tail, they want an answer 
And hip-hip hooray we lose again 
Dear god you can suit yourself 

Oh you could be an amputee 
There's got to be 
Something better than...

We stink of understatement, we're so over-friendly 
More people to latch on to 
More ears to bend 
And I swam the long route home and I've got broken shoulders 
And hip-hip hooray, we lose again 
Dear god how do you forgive yourself?

You could be an amputee 
It wouldn't matter all that much 
It wouldn't mean a thing to me 
So answer me 
Do you believe its true? 
There's gotta be something better than...

So don't listen to
Don't listen to yourselves 
We are addicted to ourselves 
We leave room for on one else 
So answer me 
Do you believe its true? 
There's gotta be something better than 

Keep pushin' back and you'll come up roses  
Keep pushin' back and you'll come up roses
We're not the same even though we share a name 
Keep pushin' back and you'll come up roses 
Keep pushin' back and you'll come up roses

I've heard it all before 
Seen it all before 
Played this scene before 

Oh you could be an amputee 
It wouldn't matter all that much, 
It wouldn't mean a thing to me 
So answer me 
Do you believe it's true? 
There's gotta be something better than this 

But it's nothing to you 
But it's nothing to you 
No it's nothing to you 
It's something better than this 

But it's nothing to you 
But it's nothing to you
No it's nothing to you 
It's something better than this
