We've got all night, lets take our time
        Tell me your secret, I'll tell you mine
        If it makes us feel better, 
        (call it love)

        You say you won't, I say you will
        You make me (crazy but I want you still)
        If it makes us feel better, 
        (call it love)

        (Do we tell the truth, do we live our lives)
        (Is the feeling good, is that what makes you fly)
        (When you say those words look me in the eye)
        Tell me why you (call it love)

        I've played my hand, you've called my bluff
        Refresh each (other till we've had enough)
        (When it's all you've got, call it love)

        (If I didn't have money, would you want me still)
        (When you look real cross do we fit the bill)
        Darling (what you want) only (time will tell)

        (break)

        (Do we tell the truth, do we live our lives)
        (Is the feeling good, is that what makes you fly)
        (When you say those words look me in the eye)
        Tell me why you (call it love)

        We've got all night, lets take our time
        Tell me your secret, I'll tell you mine
        If it makes us feel better, 
        (call it love)
        (call it love)
        (call it love)
        (call it love)
        When it's all you've got, 
        (call it love)
