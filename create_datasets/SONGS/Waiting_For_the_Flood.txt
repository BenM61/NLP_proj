Look at me, look at you
Searching for the purest blue
It's a thirst so hard to quench
And we're waiting
And we're waiting
And we're waiting
Occasional showers never drench

We're waiting for the flood

Take a glimpse behind the veil
Set you sights upon the grail
Then have it taken from hands
And you're waiting
And you're waiting
And you're waiting
All your colours turn to pale

Seems all that we get here are showers
Take a look at all the flowers
Relying on the showers
For their life's blood
For their life's blood
For their life's blood
Bet that water sure tastes good

We're waiting for the flood
