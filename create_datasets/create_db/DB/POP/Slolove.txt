I gotta take, I wanna do all the day through slow love
Ooh

You are all of me
And all that you're showing me
Is so beyond belief
I'm living a dream

Baby, take it to another level tonight
Express our lovin' in the music
Baby don't you realize that this is the time
That I am yours and you will be all mine

Oh I wanna tell you all I wanna do do is
(Uh uh)
Huh huh all the day through and
(Uh uh)
Slo slo loving undercover
Take it up, nice and slow

Oh I wanna tell you all I wanna do do is
(Uh uh)
Huh huh all the day through and
(Uh uh)
Slow slow loving undercover
Take it up, nice and slow

Freeze this moment please
Don't wanna get it out of my head
Can't control the heat
When our bodies meet
Baby, take it to another level tonight
So excited I'm beyond control
Baby don't you realize that this is the time
Didn't you know it
Didn't you know it
