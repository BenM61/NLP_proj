Don't want you for the weekend
Don't want you for a day
Don't need love divided
Don't want to feel this way
See I want you to need me (the way I need you)
Just like I need you (the way I see you)
And I want you to see me
Like no-one before

It's indefinable - magical, illogical
So make-you-mineable
You're mine

So can't you see I'm tortured
Oh can't you hear my pain
If you just let me show you
I'll be your summer rain
Then you'll feel that you want me (the way I'm feeling)
The way I want you (the way I want you)
And you know nothing's better
It's like nothing before

It's indefinable - magical, illogical
So make-you-mineable
You're mine

Now you feel what I'm feeling (don't you feel what I'm feeling)
Don't you know that it's more (it can take you places)
It can take you places
Like never before
