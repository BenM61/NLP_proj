There goes our love again
Forgive my heart, forgive my heart.
There goes our love again
Elate my heart and take the time
That's burning at the back of my mind
Cause I'm broken and blind
And holding out the drawer of desire.
There goes our love again.

I didn't go far, I didn't go far, I didn't go far and I came home.
I didn't go far, I didn't go far, I didn't go far and I came home.
But he said, "There goes our love again."
There goes our love again.

Home is a desperate end.
Cocoon my heart, cocoon my heart
And carry me to love again.
Cocoon my heart and bring me calm.
Hushing at the fear and the love,
I know you're opening doors
Just trying to pick my feelings undone
There goes our love again.

I didn't go far, I didn't go far, I didn't go far and I came home.
I didn't go far, I didn't go far, I didn't go far and I came home.
But he said, "There goes our love again."
But he said, "There goes our love again."
There goes our love again.

I didn't go far, I didn't go far, I didn't go far and I came home.
I didn't go far, I didn't go far, I didn't go far and I came home.
But he said, "There goes our love again."
But he said, "There goes our love again."
There goes our love again.

I didn't go far, I didn't go far, I didn't go far and I came home
