Heart over mind - heart over mind
I've given my heart only to you
While you stand there thinking about it
There's nothing more that I can do
When you're hiding what you feel inside
The closer we get the farther you run from the voice
That speaks from the heart
The higher we climb the harder we fall
So don't leave me hanging'
Don't leave me hangin' on!
Look over you shoulder then leave it behind
Put all the heartbreak away
We'll start all over
One step at a time
Don't let the past take my place
It's heart over mind
Heart over mind
Time after time you say:
Give up
It's too hard for you to give in
Don't let the hurt speak louder than love
Don't live yesterday again
Your mind's holding back what your heart's letting go
I'm fighting to help set you free
I'm wanting you
You're needing me
So don't leave me hangin'
Don't leave me hangin' on!
Look over your shoulder then leave it behind

Time heals the wounded and I know you will survive
Let's pick up the pieces
And put them together again
Together again
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Heart over mind 
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Heart over mind 
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Heart over mind 
Look over your shoulder then leave it behind

Oooh
Ooh
Ooh
Heart over mind 
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Heart over mind...
