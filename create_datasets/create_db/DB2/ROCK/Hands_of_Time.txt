No more tomorrow
Is what they talk about
Everyone borrows
On time while living in doubt
Innocent laughter
Filling the children's eyes
Don't let disaster
Destroy the magic of life

The sun is fading darkness comes in the sky
I wish we could turn back the hands of time

Why are we destined
Making the same mistakes
Especially next time
It could be far too late

Living together
Needing to compromise
Harder than ever
To stand the test of time
