Everytime I think of you
It always turns out good
Everytime I've held you
I thought you understood
People say a love like ours
Will surely pass
But I know a love like ours
Will last and last

But maybe I was wrong
Not knowing how our love should go
(How our love, how our love should go)
But I wasn't wrong
In knowing how our love would grow
(How our love, how our love would grow)
And everytime I think of you
Everytime
Everytime I think of you
Every single time
It always turns out good

Seasons come and seasons go
But our love will never die
Let me hold you darlin'
So you won't cry
Cause people say that our love affair
Will never last
But we know a love like ours
Will never pass

But maybe I was wrong
Not knowing how our love should go
(How our love, how our love should go)
But I wasn't wrong
In knowing how our love would grow
(How our love, how our love would grow)
And everytime I think of you
Everytime
Everytime I think of you
Every single time
It always turns out good

People say a love like ours
Will surely pass
But I know a love like ours
Will last and last

But maybe I was wrong
Not knowing how our love should go
(How our love, how our love should go)
But I wasn't wrong
In knowing how our love would grow
(How our love, how our love would grow)

Everytime I think of you
Everytime I think of you
Everytime I think of you
It always turns out good

Everytime I think of you
Everytime I think of you
Everytime I think of you (everytime)
Everytime I think of you (think of you)
Everytime I think of you (everytime)
Everytime I think of you (think of you)
