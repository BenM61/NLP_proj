I wanna hold counsel with the ghost of my father
Tell him I'll be everything he could never be
And if I face the obstacles that he failed to conquer
I'll make it to the other side

I don't wanna go lonely
I don't wanna reach out in the dead of night
And find no one to hold me
But I'm burning my bridges at the speed of light
I got a monochrome candle
Hollow in the middle, but I can't deny
That I'm just like you
Oh, I'm just like you

I wanna hold counsel with the ghost of my father
Tell him I'll be everything he could never be
And if I tame the anger in me he failed to sunder
I'll make it to the other side

I don't wanna go lonely
I don't wanna reach out in the dead of night
And find no one to hold me
But I'm burning my bridges at the speed of light
I got a monochrome candle
Hollow in the middle, but I can't deny
That I'm just like you
Oh, I'm just like you

But maybe I'm wrong
And I'm just another prodigal, and cynical son, wrong
I need to wake up, wake up, wake up
Would someone tell me how come
I can't find my equilibrium?

I don't wanna go lonely
No, I don't wanna reach out in the dead of night
And find no one to hold me
But I'm burning my bridges at the speed of light
I got a monochrome candle
Hollow in the middle, but I can't deny
That I'm just like you
That  I'm just like you
I don't wanna go lonely
I don't wanna reach out in the dead of night
And find no one to hold me
But I'm burning my bridges at the speed of light
I got a monochrome candle
Hollow in the middle, but I can't deny
That I'm just like you
Oh, I'm just like you

I'm just like you
Oh, I'm just like you
I'm just like you
Oh, I'm just like you
I'm just like you
Oh, I'm just like you
I'm just like you
I'm just like you
