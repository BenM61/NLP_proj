Baby girl, used ride on the metro
Had a dream of diamonds and stilettos
First class in Miami from the West Coast
Never wanted to be homecoming queen
Not just another girl in the strip club
Working hard, not a dollar's gonna miss her
Big, big bags, I'm gonna tip her
Making sure she's gonna come home with me

One money, two honey
How much can I throw?
And for her I can't say no
I won't let go

I fell in love with a dancer, dancer
Throwing all this cake, ooh
It's your birthday girl, I like that there
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with a dancer, dancer
In the champagne room until the sun comes up, oh my god
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with a

It's three AM and we're only getting started
In the cab on the way to your apartment
Tonight you made the killing 'cause you're gorgeous
Yeah, we're gonna have a hell of a time
Blew hunneds everywhere like a cartoon
Ooh baby, I can't take my eyes off you
Give it to me like yo mamma never taught you
I'll make it rain for the rest of your life

One money, two honey
How much can I throw?
And for her I can't say no
Oh, I won't let go

I fell in love with a dancer, dancer
Throwing all this cake, ooh
It's your birthday girl, I like that there
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with a dancer, dancer
In the champagne room until the sun comes up, oh my god
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with a

Nothing gets me going like when she put on a show
Ain't ashamed to say it, I'll let everybody know
You don't have to say no words, you let your body speak
Baby I don't care, no I don't care

I fell in love with a dancer, dancer
Throwing all this cake, ooh
It's your birthday girl, I like that there
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with a dancer, dancer
In the champagne room until the sun comes up, oh my god
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with a dancer, dancer
Throwing all this cake, ooh
It's your birthday girl, I like that there
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with a dancer, dancer
In the champagne room until the sun comes up, oh my god
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with a
