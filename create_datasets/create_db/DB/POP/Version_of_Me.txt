This is not your playground, I'm not here for you to shoot me down
Praying on my weakness, even when you're not around
Nothing lasts forever but you're wrapped around my DNA
And I'm hiding in the corner, the wounded kid I was
Like it was yesterday, like nothing's changed

All that you've done, you see
Ever so quietly comes creeping back up on me
Haunting me, goading me, why can't you let go of me?
I don't have the patience anymore

That's not me, I won't be the version of me (me)
The one you think you're comfortable with (me)
The one you think you had your fun with
If I can't trust myself, why should I trust anyone else?
