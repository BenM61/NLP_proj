Doom, da da-di da-di, doom, da da-di da-di

Everybody's gonna love today
Gonna love today, gonna love today
Everybody's gonna love today, gonna love today
Anyway you want to, anyway you've got to
Love love me, love love me, love love

I've been crying for so long
Fighting tears just to carry on
But now, but now it's gone away

Hey girl, why can't you carry on?
Is it 'cause you're just like your mother?
Little tyke, like to tease for fun?
Well, you ain't gonna tease no other
Gonna make you a lover

Everybody's gonna love today, love today, love today
Everybody's gonna love today
Anyway you want to, anyway you've got to
Love love me, love love me, love love

Girl in a groove with the big bust on
Big bust on, big bust on
Wait till your mother and your papa's gone, papa's gone
Momma, momma papa
Shock shock me, shock shock me, shock shock

Said everybody's gonna love today
Gonna love today, gonna love today
I said everybody's gonna love today, gonna love today
Anyway you want to, anyway you've got to
Love love me, love love me, love love

Carolina sits on ninety-five
Give her a dollar and she'll make you smile
Hooker, what a looker, walk away!

Carry dresses like a kid for fun
Licks her lips like they're something other
Tries to tell you life has just begun
But you know she's getting something other
Than the love from her mother

Everybody's gonna love today, love today, love today
Everybody's gonna love today
Anyway you want to, anyway you've got to
Love love me, love love me, love love

Girl in a groove with the big bust on
Big bust on, big bust on
Wait till your mother and your papa's gone, papa's gone
Momma, momma papa
Shock shock me, shock shock me, shock shock

I said everybody's gonna love today
Gonna love today, gonna love today
I said everybody's gonna love today, gonna love today
Anyway you want to, anyway you've got to
Love love me, love love me, love love
