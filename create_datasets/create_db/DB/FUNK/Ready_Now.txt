I think I'm ready now
I think I'm ready, ready for love
I know what to do
I think I'm ready now
I think I'm ready, ready for love
You know what to do

I think I'm ready now
I think I'm ready, ready for love
I know what to do
I think I'm ready now
I think I'm ready, ready for love
You know what to do

I been holdin' on so damn long
But now I'm quittin' the game
See, I was thinkin' that I could be wifey
If I made you wait

Unless you know every woman
Has piece and mine are overdue
I'm open if you wanna
Get all up inside of truth

I think I'm ready now
I think I'm ready, ready for love
I know what to do
I think I'm ready now
I think I'm ready, ready for love
You know what to do

I think I'm ready now
I think I'm ready, ready for love
I know what to do
I think I'm ready now
I think I'm ready, ready for love
You know what to do

You make me so [Incomprehensible] with you
Can't believe that you teachin' me things
That I thought I already knew

Don't think I ever wanted somethin' so bad
I'm willin' to just blow the time
Oh, I wanted to call someone my own like this
Tell them other niggas in line

I think I'm ready now
I think I'm ready, ready for love
I know what to do
I think I'm ready now
I think I'm ready, ready for love
You know what to do

I think I'm ready now
I think I'm ready, ready for love
I know what to do
I think I'm ready now
I think I'm ready, ready for love
You know what to do

Throw me on the counter by the kitchen door
Let's do acrobatics, make my body soar
Make the neighbors jealous and I'll make you scream
My legs around your pelvis, ain't got no other things

I think I'm ready now
I think I'm ready, ready for love
I know what to do
I think I'm ready now
I think I'm ready, ready for love
You know what to do

I think I'm ready now
I think I'm ready, ready for love
I know what to do
I think I'm ready now
I think I'm ready, ready for love
You know what to do

Ooh, by the candlelight
Ooh, you know what I like
