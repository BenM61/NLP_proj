Hey
Wait a minute
Hey

I said, baby
I love the way that you hold me
And you touch me like you know me
See, I don't want nobody else
And I, I'm 'bout to offer all I can give him
'Cause I'm a slave to his rhythm
I said, I just can't help myself

'Cause, baby, I love ya
And I trust ya
You don't have to worry 'bout nothing
Oh, I'm alive right now; look at me
And I want ya
No, I need ya
And I'll do anything to please ya
I just want you to take control of me (take control)

[Chorus:]
I said, hey (hey)
Show me how you want it now
(Do you) like it when I take it down?
I got everything
And anything you need, I wanna bring it to you, baby
Hey (hey)
Come a little closer now
(Don't stop) Wanna go another round
You got everything
And anything I need, want you to bring it to me, baby

Take control of me (Take control of me)
Take control of me (Take control of me)
Take control of me (Take control of me)
Take control

I said, baby
I got to tell you how much I love it
The way you kiss my neck in public
I try my best not to blush
Even when an argument comes around
You take the time to break it down
And you're never, ever in a rush
(Never, never, never, ever, never, never!)

And I'm scared, and I'm nervous
Trying is always worth it
Oh, I'm alive right now; look at me
And I want him, I need him
I'll find him, I'll forgive him, I'll feed him
(Oh) I just want you to take control of me (take control)

[Chorus]

Take control of me (Take control of me)
Take control of me (Take control of me)
Take control of me (Take control of me)
Take control

[Bridge:]
Now, if you feel what I feel, come and take control of me
Don't you mind how you feelin'; just take control of me
'Cause you got my soul on fire, and I feel just fine
You got what I need
Na, na, na, na
(Na, na, na, na, hey, hey, hey) hey, hey, hey!
(Na, na, na, na, hey, hey, hey)

I said, hey (hey)
Show me how you want it now (Show me how you want it)
(Do you) like it when I take it down?
I got everything
And anything you need, I wanna bring it to you, baby (oh)
Hey (hey)
Come a little closer now (Come a little closer)
(Don't stop) Wanna go another round
You got everything
And anything I need, want you to bring it to me, baby

Take control of me (Take control of me)
Take control of me (lost to me)
Take control of me (Take control of me)
Why don't you come a little closer?

Hey!

(Na, na, na, na, hey, hey, hey)
(Na, na, na, na, hey, hey, hey)

Hey, hey, hey!
