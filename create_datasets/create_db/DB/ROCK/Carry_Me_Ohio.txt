I'm Sorry that
I could never love you back
I could never care enough
In these last days

Her tears
Fell on her pages found me well
On her words I don't know what
To do or say

Wading through
Warm canals and pools clear blue
Where Tuscarawas flow into
The Great Lakes

Riding back
To where the highway met
Dead end tracks
The ground is now cement and glass
And far away

Heal her soul, carry her, my angel, Ohio

Green green youth
What about the sweetness we knew
What about what's good what's true
From those days

Can't count to
All the lovers I've burned through
So why do I still burn for you
I can't say

Sorry that
I could never love you back
I could never care enough in these last days

Heal her soul, carry her, my angel, Ohio

Children bless
And gather round the bed she rests
So poor and cold in their Midwest
Moon and sun

Flashes bringing on
My open eyes to lightning storm
The touch of mist felt soft, felt warm
On my face

Graving dreams
A million miles ago you seem
A star that I just don't see
Anymore

Words long gone
Lost on journeys we walked on
Lost are voices heard along the way

Sorry for
Never going by your door
Never feeling love like that
Anymore

Heal her soul, carry her, my angel, Ohio
