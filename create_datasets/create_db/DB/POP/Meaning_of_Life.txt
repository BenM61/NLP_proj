Baby, I've been living in the dark
The only friend I've got here is my broken heart
Feeling like I've finally had enough
Living like an animal can be so rough

I've been waiting so long for you to come my way
And now I, I can't wait another day

When you hold me, I finally see
When you say love, I know what it means
I was broke down so long in the dark
Until you showed me the light (baby)
'Cause when you kiss me, I know who I am
And when you let me feel it I understand
When I'm lost I just look in your eyes
You show me the meaning of life
Meaning of life, life, life, life
You show me the meaning of life
Meaning of life, life, life, life
You show me the meaning of life

Every time I spend a lonely night, yeah
Thinking I won't make it 'til the morning light
All I do is think of you and I (you and I)
Suddenly the wrongs they start to feel so right

I've been waiting so long for you to come my way (come my way, yeah)
And now I, I can't wait another day

When you hold me, I finally see
When you say love, I know what it means
I was broke down so long in the dark
Until you showed me the light
'Cause when you kiss me, I know who I am
And when you let me feel it, I understand
When I'm lost I just look in your eyes
You show me the meaning of life
Meaning of life, life, life, life
You show me the meaning of life
Meaning of life, life, life, life
Show me the meaning of life

You show me love
You lift me up
You take me higher and higher
The truth is I'm in love
Can you feel us, we're flying higher
Oh, you show me love
You lift me up
You take me higher and higher
The truth is I'm in love
Can you feel us, we're flying higher

Meaning of life, life, life, life
You show me the meaning of life
Meaning of life, life, life, life
Show me the meaning of life
Show me the meaning of life
Show me the meaning of life
