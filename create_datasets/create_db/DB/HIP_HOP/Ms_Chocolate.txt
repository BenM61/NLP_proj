This is for the chocolate girls
All Around the word

Every block
Every club
Every hood
I'm in love

So sweet, so round, so thick
So nasty ooh I love that shit
So smooth, so creamy
Goddamn it I must be dreaming
So jiggly, so soft
Goddamn it I wanna break you off
So hot you gon' melt
Eat you all up by myself
Girl I can't wait to unwrap ya
It's a chocolate fix I'm after
So tasty, my treat
Miss Chocolate let me get a little piece
I'm cuckoo for cocoa
So good I want me some more
I'm caught up
I need to stop it
Goddamn I love you Miss Chocolate!

Talking to my silky smooth, dark skin, chocolate, women
Independent, this is y'alls anthem
I like them light skinned girls
But that dark skin I love
Chocolate girls stand up
This is y'alls anthem

Talking about hips
Talking about thighs
Talking about big ol' booties and brown eyes
Chocolate, that's what I gotta have tonight
Leave up out the club with two tonight
Take shots then more shots
Then we drink like we own the bar
And she's pushing that all on me
Conversation like let's just leave

And I don't hesitate(No)
To the crib right away
She dropping it
Dropping it
That Chocolate
Chocolate

Talking to my silky smooth, dark skin, chocolate, women
Independent, this is y'alls anthem
I like them light skinned girls
But that dark skin I love
Chocolate girls stand up
This is y'alls anthem

Had a red bone chick before
She don't do it like you do
So I know what I want tonight
Fly,
On a chocolate high
Baby girl your thick in all the right places
Let me lick that chocolate baby I wanna taste it
Think I'm in love(with your dark skin)
Said I'm in love with Miss Chocolate!

Talking to my silky smooth, dark skin, chocolate, women
