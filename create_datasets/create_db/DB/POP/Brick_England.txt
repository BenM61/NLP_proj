Evening
When the sun begins to sink
Behind the smoke
There's a burning red glow
All around

Watching
As the colour starts to fade
And the darkness
Seems to rise out of the ground
Of the ground

Walls, rise and fall
And now that buildings talk
In the city
Brick England

They build them up
And then they
Knock 'em down
To put up another
Brick England

Evening
Creeps beyond the terraced walls
Up the church steeples
And the chimney pots so high
So high

Watching
The moon is lost behind black clouds
And the darkness
Seems to crawl up to the sky
To the sky

Walls, rise and fall
And now that buildings talk
In the city
Brick England

They build them up
And then they
Knock 'em down
To put up another
Brick England

England

They build them up
And then they
Knock 'em down
To put up another
Brick England

Brick Lane in the rain
Road closed
Diversion
Snake of tourists meandering under grey cloud
In brick England
