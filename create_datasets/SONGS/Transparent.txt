Look at how they look at you
Used up again
Feel
Feel how they're treating you
Only for their use again
Respect
They've never seen it
Another one is how they see it
Only in this to be used
You're only in this to be used

Hands on mine
Hands all over me
Scarring my mind so easily
Hands all over you
Tearing every part of me
Hands all over you
There's always something that reminds me

I've been there before
Deep inside the innocent
I've laid there before
Feeling transparent
But this time it's you
I'm in love with what they've all used
I'm afraid to say it
I know you know it

Hands on mine
Hands all over me
Scarring my mind so easily
Hands all over you
Tearing every part of me
Hands all over you
There's always something that reminds me

Live, lust life
Live, I tried to live
Lust, I tried to forget
Life, I tried
But it's you
