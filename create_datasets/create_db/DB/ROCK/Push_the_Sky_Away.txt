I was riding, I was riding home
The sun, the sun, the sun was rising from the field

I got a feeling I just can't shake
I got a feeling that just won't go away

You've got to just keep on pushing it
Keep on pushing it
Push the sky away

And if your friends think that you should do it different
And if they think that you should do it the same

You've got to just keep on pushing it
Keep on pushing it
Push the sky away

And if you feel you got everything you came for
If you got everything and you don't want no more

You've got to just keep on pushing it
Keep on pushing it
Push the sky away

And some people say it's just rock and roll
Ah but it gets you right down to your soul

You've got to just keep on pushing it
Keep on pushing it
Push the sky away

You've got to just keep on pushing it
Keep on pushing it
Push the sky away

You've got to just keep on pushing it
Keep on pushing it
