Think I'm off my head
One more drink and I might be dead
And I know that I'm a mess
Got no money left in my Natwest
Think I'm off my head
Think I'm off my head

It's 25 past 10 and again I'm all alone
Can't remember what I said
But I bet it went something like, something like
Gina, I know that I felt fine
But I need a helpline to kill this fever

Gina, I know that I felt fine
But I need a helpline to kill this fever
Gina, I know that I felt fine
But I need a helpline to kill this fever
I know what I felt, would you send me a helpline?

Think I lost my head, can't find my phone
And I wanna know when I got back home
Think I lost my head
Think I lost my head
 
It's 25 past 10 and again I'm all alone
Can't remember what I said
But I bet it went something like, something like
Gina, I know that I felt fine
But I need a helpline to kill this fever

Gina, I know that I felt fine
But I need a helpline to kill this fever
Gina, I know that I felt fine
But I need a helpline to kill this fever
I know what I felt, would you send me a helpline?

I saying, Gina
I'm saying, Gina
