I need your body
Ooh that sexy body baby
I got to have you now
(ooh you're from heaven babe)
But I could never sex you
And not see you mama
When I'm lovin' you down

I feel the raindrops fallin' down
I wish the sun would come around
I miss the warm wind in your hair
And when it comes we will be there
And you know we'll be

[Chorus]
Livin' it up in the sunshine
Givin' it up only you and me
Givin' it up in the sunshine baby
Livin' it up where we can see
Givin' it up in the sunshine
Livin' it up only you and me
Livin' it up in the sunshine baby
Givin' it up where we can see

I got to have you baby
I know you want me too
But I can't see you well at night

Well I got to wait for the sun
I'd never love you in darkness
So baby don't ask me to commit
Such a crime

[Chorus]
There's gonna be a party for days
Playin' when the players play

[Chorus]
Don't want to love you in the darkness baby
I'll only love you in the sunlight sugar
Well it's a crime not to see that body
We are just givin' it up, yeah

There's gonna be a party for days
Playin' when the players play
