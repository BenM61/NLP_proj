The sound that you're listening to 
Is from my guitar that's named Lucille
I'm very crazy about Lucille, Lucille took me from the plantation
Or you might say, brought me fame
I don't think I could just talk enough about Lucille
Sometime when I'm blue seem like Lucille try to help me call my name

I used to sing spirituals and I thought that this 
Was the thing that I wanted to do 
But somehow or other When I went in the army I picked up on Lucille, and started the singing blues

Well, now when I'm paying my dues, 
Maybe you don't know what I mean when I say paying dues, I mean when things are bad with me
I can always, I can always, you know like, depend on Lucille

Sort of hard to talk to you myself
I guess I'll let Lucille say a few words and then

You know, I doubt if you can feel it like I do
But when I think about the things that I've gone through,
Like, well for instance, if I have a girlfriend and she misuses me,
And I go home at night, maybe I'm lonely 
Well not maybe, I am lonely, I pick up Lucille
And it bring out those funny sounds that sound good to me, you know?
Sometime I get to the place where I can't even say nothing
Look out

Sometime I think it's crying

You know, if I could sing pop tunes like Frank Sinatra or, 
Sammy Davis Junior, I don't think I still could do it, 
'Cause Lucille don't wanna play nothing but the blues
And I think I'm, I think I'm pretty glad about that
'Cause don't nobody sing to me like Lucille
Sing, Lucille

Well, I'll put it like this, take it easy, Lucille
I like the way Sammy sings and I like the way Frank sings, 
But I can get a little Frank, Sammy, 
A little Ray Charles, in fact all the people with soul in this

A little Mahalia Jackson in there

One more, Lucille!

Take it easy now, ah!

You know, I imagine a lot of you wanna know, 
A lot of you wanna know why I call the guitar Lucille 
Lucille has practically saved my life two or three times 
No kidding, it really has

I remember once I was in an automobile accident, and
When the car stopped turning over, it fell over on Lucille, 
And it held it up off me, really, it held it up off me 
So that's one time it saved my life

The way, the way I came by the name of Lucille, 
I was Over in Twist, Arkansas, I know you've never heard of that one, have you? 
And one night the guys started a ball over there, you know, started brawling, you know what I mean
And the guy that was mad with his old lady, 
When she fell over on this gas tank that was burning for heat, 
The gas ran all over the floor

And when the gas ran all over the floor, the building
Caught on fire, and almost burned me up trying to save Lucille
Oh I, I imagine you're still wondering why I call it Lucille
The lady that started that brawl that night was named Lucille

And that's been Lucille ever since to me
One more now, Lucille

Sounds pretty good to me. Can I do one more?

Look out, Lucille

Sounds pretty good. I think I'll try one more 
All right
