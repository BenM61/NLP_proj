I was looking in the wrong direction
Last year's my toll
Last year's life
I was living by the false impression
Everyone will have their time
If we're staying
What's the role we're playing?
I got lost in all these lines
I've been dreaming
And at best, believing
I'll come around before I die

All the races you're not gonna run
When tomorrow's gone, tomorrow's gone
All the places we'd never belong
When tomorrow's gone, tomorrow's gone
I will lie in wait for your song
A way to turn on
The lines to be drawn
Yeah, taking you on
When tomorrow's gone

I was looking in the wrong direction
Crept up on me just in time
You've been giving me the wrong connections
I can't waste what I can't find
Are you seeing? 
You're on your own
No where to start, no where to go. 
I'm bleeding
Every fool that's bleeding,
Let it go, connect the lines.

All the races you're not gonna run
When tomorrow's gone, tomorrow's gone
All the places we'd never belong
When tomorrow's gone, tomorrow's gone
I will lie in wait for your song
A way to turn on
The lines to be drawn
Yeah, I am taking you on.

All the races you're not gonna run
When tomorrow's gone, tomorrow's gone
All the places we'd never belong
When tomorrow's gone, tomorrow's gone
I will lie in wait for your song
A way to turn on
The lines to be drawn
Yeah, I am taking you on
Yeah, I am taking you on
Yeah, I am taking you on
