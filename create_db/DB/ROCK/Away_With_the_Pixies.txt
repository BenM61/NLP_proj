I'll cross your path
You won't let me forget it
You can change your name
And make me remember it

And they think that you're too much for words
But they don't know how to show it
They've labeled you most likely to succeed
Though you don't know how they'd know it

I don't want your stories anymore
They were fun when I was four
I'd do away with the pixies
If you could give me something more
She's away with the pixies

We'll work it out
We'll make it worthwhile
Cause you can't always change your name
Like your clothes go out of style

And they're jealous cause you know so much
They can't quite get a grip
You're everything they wish they were
You never miss a trick

I don't want your stories anymore
They were fun when I was four
I'd do away with the pixies
If you could give me something more
She's away with the pixies
