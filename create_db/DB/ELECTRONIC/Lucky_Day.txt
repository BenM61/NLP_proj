Could it my, could it be my
Could it be my lucky day?

I like a phone call
I like to hear something like this
Woah, woah, woah, woah
A conversation
That maybe leads into a kiss (aha)
Mwoah, mwoah, mwoah, mwoah

Aah, say that you love me
Say that you need me too
Best you ever had
It could be so easy
For you to please me, baby
So how come you tease me?

You told me so what do you say?
Are you gonna take this golden opportunity?
Won't you give it to me, because you've got what I want
Maybe it's my lucky day

Just like the first spark
And watch the fireworks explode
Boom, boom, baby
You've got a fast car
So why the hell we driving slow?
Zoom, zoom, zoom to me

Kisses on my pillow
I've hundreds of those though
I want something more
So congratulations
It's not the occasion they went
I get my way

You told me so what do you say?
Are you gonna take this golden opportunity?
Won't you give it to me, because you've got what I want
Maybe it's my lucky day

Uhu, ow
Gonna be my lu-uh-uh-uh
My lucky da-ay, my lucky day
What do you say?
Are you gonna take this golden opportunity?
Just give it to me, because you've got what I want
Maybe it's my lucky day, my, my lucky day

Could it my, could it be my
Could it be my lucky day (day, day, day, maybe it's my lucky day)?

You told me so what do you say?
Are you gonna take this golden opportunity?
Won't you give it to me, because you've got what I want
Maybe it's my lucky day

My day, day, day
Maybe it's my lucky day
Maybe it's my lucky day
Maybe it's my lucky day
