(My DJ is live in the place)

We're all here for just one thing
DJ, play one for the girls to sing
'Cause we know where there's girls there'll always be guys
With the soul he's playing got me feeling so high, yeah

Can he read my mind how'd he know the next one is my tune
He's teasing me mixing in quietly for the drop, better make room (Come on)

If you ain't moving tell me what you came for
If you ain't moving tell me what you came for
Reload the track and have me screaming out for more
Tell me what you came for

If you ain't moving tell me what you came for
If you ain't moving tell me what you came for
Reload the track and have me screaming out for more
Tell me what you came for

Give me that groove, give me that swing
'Cause when I go hard I'll give you everything
I won't need no rest, won't find me by the bar
'Cause the dance floor's only where I keep my heart

Can he read my mind how'd he know the next one is my tune
He's teasing me mixing in quietly for the drop, better make room (Come on)

If you ain't moving tell me what you came for 
If you ain't moving tell me what you came for
Reload the track and have me screaming out for more
Tell me what you came for

If you ain't moving tell me what you came for
If you ain't moving tell me what you came for
Reload the track and have me screaming out for more
Tell me what you came for

Come DJ, feed the fire
Throw 'em down like gasoline
Get in my blood, come take me higher
No-one can challenge our scene

Come DJ, feed the fire
Throw 'em down like gasoline
Get in my blood, come take me higher
No-one can challenge our scene

If you ain't moving tell me what you came for
If you ain't moving tell me what you came for
Reload the track and have me screaming out for more
Tell me what you came for

If you ain't moving tell me what you came for
If you ain't moving tell me what you came for
Reload the track and have me screaming out for more
Tell me what you came for
