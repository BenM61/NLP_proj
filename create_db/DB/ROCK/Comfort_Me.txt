inside, I'm all twisted around feeling uptight and I can't come down
and I need someone to tell me
I'll be safe again
and I need someone to tell me
that they really care

what have we become
could you comfort me, comfort me
the whole world's come undone
could you comfort me, comfort me

back up, evolution here
all the sick fucks
being born to kill
they just need someone to tell them
they're safe again
they all need someone to tell them
that somebody cares

you're going to bring the world down
the whole world down
