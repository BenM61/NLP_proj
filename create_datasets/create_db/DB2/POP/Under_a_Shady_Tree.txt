Under a shady tree you and me
Under a shady tree you and me
Under a shady tree you and me
Lying under a shady tree you and me

Can you feel the breeze blow by?
Can you feel it on your face?
This is our special place

Under a shady tree you and me
Lying under a shady tree you and me
Under a shady tree you and me
Under a shady tree you and me

Can you feel the soft cool grass?
Can you feel it with your toes?
We can sit here while it grows

Under a shady tree you and me
Under a shady tree you and me

If you want to close your eyes
And sleep beneath the tree
You can rest your head on me

Under a shady tree, you and me
Under a shady tree, you and me
Lying under a shady tree, you and me
Under a shady tree, you and me

Ba beda ba ba dee ba, you and me

Do dodo do do do do, you and me
Do dodo do do do do, you and me

La ladee da la la la, you and me
La la la la la la la, you and me

Ba beda ba ba dee da, you and me
Ba beda ba, ba beda ba, you and me

Ba beda ba ba dee da, you and me
