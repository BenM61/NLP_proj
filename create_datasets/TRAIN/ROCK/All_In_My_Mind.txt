Walk around so cold 
So cold and lonely 
Or lay in bed wondering what 
To do with time 
You've got no sense of fun 
Until you know you've won again 
And yet you feel so much 
You feel so much inside 

You want to rip all the 
Jewels off all the idiots' backs so badly 
You scream give me what I've always 
Missed, give me a good time 
But if you look into your mirror 
You'll see that nobody has ever ripped you off 
It's all in your mind 

Her beauty can only ever be skin deep 
But if I'm honest that's all I ever 
Really need 
So throw us some flowers and we'll 
Give you some songs and sunshine 

And if you give me an hour 
I'll show you how you feel

Ohhh baby, ohhh I'm much too lazy 
Ohhh it's all in my mind 
So don't be unkind 
It's all in my mind 
It's all in my mind 

Sometimes you really don't 
Really don't really don't know 
What I mean 
Sometimes you really don't 
Really don't really don't 
Know what I need 

I say I've got no sense of 
Fun until I know I've won again 
And how do you think yes how 
Do you think that feels 
So, just give me an hour 
I'll show you how you feel 

Ohhh baby 
Ohhh I'm much too lazy 
Ohhh baby 
Ohhh it's all in my mind 
So don't be unkind 
It's all in my mind
