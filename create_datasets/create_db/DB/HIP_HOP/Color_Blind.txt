I've been so colorblind
And I've been so colorblind (haha, yeah)

Ayy, trips to the mall, I just stripped in the fall
I think I might really be the one after all
The one to rule them all, I'm the chosen one, the savior
But all these triple six, make it look like I was up to no good
At least that's what my momma said, yeah
Now I'm the one givin' momma bread
Done with that pain, I'm just so heartless

I've been so colorblind
And I've been so colorblind
(I said)
(I said)

Love don't cost a thing
Yeah, so all my girls need diamond rings
Yeah, yo, yo 
Text that I sent that you never ever read got me feeling like you never ever ever ever really cared (yeah)
But that's ok though
I hope you feel ok though
They used to call me Diego
My favorite drink is Faygo
I been so
(I said)
(I said)

I've been so colorblind
I've been so colorblind

And I've been so colorblind
I said, I've been so colorblind
