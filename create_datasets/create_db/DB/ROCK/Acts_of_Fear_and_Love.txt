Acts of fear and love

I had this teacher once tell me
'There's no such thing as hate
Just acts of fear and love'
I said 'that's a bold statement to make'
She said 'think about it' and went on to explain
With every word that was spoken
The clearer it all became
I was looking out the window
I was watching colours change
I was waving at the children
In passenger aeroplanes
It's funny how you forget things
So important at the time
It's funny how you forget things

Acts of fear and acts of love
Acts of fear and acts of love

I had a friend when I was younger
Do anything for anyone
He had the weight of the world on his back
He loved the birds and the sun
He would make quick money
Settle scores with his hands
But little did he know back then
That there were flaws in his plans
Things went a little too far
Got lost in his own design
Lost his footing on the ladder
He carelessly continued to climb
Fell down from a great height
Into the hands of the law
He got sentenced to eight long years
But he'll be out in four

Acts of fear and acts of love
Acts of fear and acts of love

Two motivating forces make space for your darkness
Transcends your fear, let love in
Fear, love
Fear, love
Fear, love
Fear, love
Fear

Acts of love can be seen
If only few and far between
Acts of love can be seen
If only few and far between
Acts of love can be seen
If only few and far between
Acts of love can be seen
If only few and far between
