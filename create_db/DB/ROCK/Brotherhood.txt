As I walk through this land,
I remember the boys who took a stand,
Who stood there strong when things got rough,
They would shout and scream at the things that were tough,
No weapon formed against them would live,
A punch to the face, a kick to the rib
Their cause was justice and they strove to be pure,
All of hell shook when their knees hit the floor,

Never look back never give up,
There's someone behind who will pick you up,
I got a sword in my hand and I'm ready for the attack.

Raise up the flag let them see,
Our creed is a symbol for those who are free,
We fight against evil, we fight against sin,
Our battles not outward, our battles within.
