Yo, nowadays girls be out for the money and things
But to me it's all sweet when I'm runnin' my game
I give 'em nothing but game till it's stuck in their brain
So once it's stuck in they brain, yeah my funnin' began
I'm in the want-ad, lookin' for a special woman
That's gonna gimme what I need anytime I want it
I take a cruise to Aruba, I'll bring you wit me
Then let you float out on the beach
With the string o' yo' "G"
I need a pretty momma
Silly momma, diddy poppa
Like that go to Great Adventure in they mini-chopper
That get her own chips, push her own six
And make me do my sits when I finish my dips

I like it, I like it
I really really like it
You want it and you know it
But you play hard to get boy

I like it, I like it
I really really like it
You want it and you know it
But you play hard to get boy

Yo, real chicks do real things
Like find a man wit' a deal that still wanna sling
Always speak my mind whenever I feel things
Probably got no wings but I'mma still swing
And my real chicks feel what I mean
Am I right? Am I tight?
Do this chick bring it to the light
Is my body so right I could even attract a dyke
Uh Baby Stase, uh Baby Stase
While you was lovin' John Doe 
I copped a condo
While you was layin' backs down, I was layin' tracks down
I see it for a fact now, it's intact now
It's no need to beef, it's my turn to eat
Bring the drama to a cease, cars I don't lease
I push a Green Z-3, watch a screen TV, what
I'ma forever rise 
Rings be tetra-size
Girls be petrified
It's a heavy meza-ride

I like it, I like it
I really really like it
You want it and you know it
But you play hard to get boy

I like it, I like it
I really really like it
You want it and you know it
But you play hard to get boy

Yo, you better do what I say yo
Get this through your head-o
Long time comin', but waitin for my date-o
My man Blake-o, leave the scene hardly awake-o
If he could take three shots, he could take four
I'm on the low though
But wit a lot of dough tho'
And I hate a smart chick givin' me a dodo
That gimme mo' pleasin', and mo' reason
Just to lay up in Cali in the Four Season
Wit' a chick half Black, half Indonesian
Appalachian, I know this sound unbelievin'
Switch the rim's on the Benz every four seasons
Open up a new account just to through G's in
Got Blink chick follow me for no reason
And my girl stick around if she know I'm cheatin', what
