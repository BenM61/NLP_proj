For a little piece of a second
I have seen men blinking and sparkling
Test screen colored, wiped out afterwards
Still they're thinking they were universe

They swallow the worlds
They swallow the worlds around me

Located everywhere, decentralized
Cut into pieces and set up again
They burst to dust, they turn to liquid
Spread themselves like sunlight
Thinking they were universe

They swallow the worlds
They swallow the worlds around me
They swallow the worlds
They swallow the worlds around me

They swallow the worlds
They swallow the worlds around me
They swallow the worlds
They swallow the worlds around me
