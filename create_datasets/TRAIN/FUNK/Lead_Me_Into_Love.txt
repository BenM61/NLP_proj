We may never understand
If love just happens or it's planned
We must believe our spirits know somehow
Baby, we can't stop the falling we feel now oooh

New emotions overflow
And now this heartbeat wants control oooh baby
If the love was meant to be so strong
Something close to magic's coming on

Take my heart and lead me into love
Light the way for me
Without your touch, I cannot see
Lead me into love 

I'm deep in the miracle of you oooh
