Say that you'll be The one
Drowning in my heart, to be
Drowning in your arms, (take me)
3 summers heat, tangled up
In sheets (take me)

I'm as steady as a sea saw,
And as longing as the wind,
Visions of you come so filling
I swoon -- so far

And distant and under the same
Moon, all I ask is you to
Take Me
Under the strength of your

Words my heart is carried
By a hundred birds (Take me)

Into death I do seep, into
The arms of your hearts
Sleep (take me)

Breathing as you where,
Lying on The floor
Take Me
Take Me.
