i've got to find the time to look back let down so many times before had to find something more i've been pushed aside,but in the end i just keep pushing back been left behind,but i found something more and what i found helped me turn it around but i'll never forget...i understand that look in your eyes and the story of your life tells me that we've travelled different roads but on the same path you've been pushed aside,but in the end you just keep pushing back been left behind,but you found something more and what you found helped you turn it around and what we found wont let us ever forget that we've been betrayed had to find something more i can learn to forgive,but never to forget because we've been betrayed
