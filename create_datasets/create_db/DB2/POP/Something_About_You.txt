Follow me, just trust me
It's gonna be a good thing for us
I know that you're worried
There is nothing to fear
Let me lead, believe me
We're gonna be just fine, I promise
The storm clouds are parting
No more counting the tears

There's something about you I can't describe
If only you could see yourself through my eyes
There is nothing I won't do to show you why
You cannot hide, you're simply one of a kind

Your laugh is contagious
I could look in your eyes for ages
Really, there's no ending
All the joy that you bring

There's something about you I can't describe
If only you could see yourself through my eyes
There is nothing I won't do to show you why
You cannot hide, you're simply one of a kind
There's something about you (something that I can't describe)
If only you could see yourself through my eyes

There is nothing I won't do (and now I'm here to show you why)
You cannot hide, you're simply one of a kind

When your universe begins to shake
If you feel like it's all falling a, falling a, falling a, falling a, falling apart
(Something that I can't describe)
(And now I'm here to show you why)
I'll be there, I'll be there to remind you

There's something about you I can't describe
If only you could see yourself through my eyes
There is nothing I won't do to show you why 
You cannot hide

I can see your universe (something that I can't describe)
Begin to shake (could you see yourself through my eyes?)
And you feel like it's hard (and now I'm here to show you why)
Falling (apart)
I can see your universe (something that I can't describe)
Begin to shake (could you see yourself through my eyes?)
And you feel like it's hard (and now I'm here to show you why)
Falling apart
