Took a look to the future
Thought I could see love slippin' away
And I just couldn't take it
But I never forget you
I couldn't get by another day
And I just wouldn't make it

Could I tell ya how much I need you?
How ever far away, yeah
Could I tell ya how much I miss you?
So much more than words can say

I love you more than words can say

Took a look in my mirror
Thought I could see love fading away
And I just couldn't face it
And I dreamt that you left me
Takin' away the light from my day
And I couldn't replace it

Could I tell ya how much I need you?
How ever far away, yeah
Could I tell ya how much I miss you?
So much more than words can say

It can take a long time to realize that your mine
But you can be a fool forever
You're not forever, you're not forever
Woh

Took a look to the future
Thought I could see love slippin' away
And I just couldn't take it

Could I tell ya how much I need you?
How ever far away, yeah
Could I tell ya how much I miss you?
So much more than words can say

Could I tell ya how much I need you?
How ever far away, yeah
Could I tell ya how much I miss you?
So much more than words can say

Could I tell ya how much I need you?
How ever far away, yeah
Could I tell you how much I miss you?
