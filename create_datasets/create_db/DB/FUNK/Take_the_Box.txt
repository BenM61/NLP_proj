Your neighbors were screaming
I don't have a key for downstairs
So I punched all the buzzers hoping he would be there
And now my head's hurting 
You say I always get my own way
But you were in the shower when I got there
And I don' wanted to stay, but I got nothing to say

You were so beautiful before today
And then I heard what you say'man that was ugly

The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Frank's in there and I don't care
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Just take it
Take the box

Take the box

I came home this evening and nothing felt like how it should be
I feel like writing you a letter but that is not me'you know me
Feel so fucking angry; don't want to be reminded of you
But when I left my shit in your kitchen
I said goodbye to your bedroom it smelled of you

Mr False Pretence, you don't make sense
I just don't know you
But you make me cry, where's my kiss goodbye'
I think I love you

The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Frank's in there and I don't care
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Now take it
Take the box
Just take it, take it 
Take the box
And now just take the box
Take the box

Take the box
