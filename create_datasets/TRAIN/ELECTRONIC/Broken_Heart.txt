It's not the way you bring me to my knees
It's not the way you borrow, beg or plead
It could be false although it could be true
A simple touch, a hand to hold onto
I'm on the verge of nowhere
The sight, the sound, of nobody there
You can't break the pieces of a broken heart in two
So why do you
You can't break the pieces of a broken heart in two
Tell me tell me why do you
It's not the way you look from side to side
Unlock the door, you need not run and hide
It could be true we've taken it a bit too far
Sweet and simple is all we really are
There comes a time, my love, there comes a time
A friend for summer is a friend forever
So they say and so we go
Do you believe I would hide the truth from you
Oh silly girl, there's things I would rather do
We spend our time in search of the perfect rhyme
When all the while, we have it all the time
Falling off the edge of nowhere
The sight, the sound, of nobody there
You can't break the pieces of a broken heart in two,
So why do you
You can't break the pieces of a broken heart in two,
So tell me tell me why do you
