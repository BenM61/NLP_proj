Who do you know in Heaven
That made you the angel you are
Who did you see I wonder
That made you just the cutest little charmer by far

Where did you get those good looks
Those eyes that glow like a star
It seems they made the sun shine only twice
In your sweet smile and Paradise

So, tell me, won't you, Darling
Who do you know in Heaven
That made you the angel you are

(Who do you know in Heaven , Honey)
(That made you the angel you are)
(Who did you see I wonder)
(That made you just the cutest little charmer by far)
(And where did you get those good looks, Baby)
(Those eyes that glow just like a star)
It seems they made the sun shine only twice
In your sweet smile and Paradise

So, tell me, won't you, Darling
Who do you know in Heaven
That made you the angel you are

Darling, won't you tell me
Who do you know in Heaven
That made you the angel you are
