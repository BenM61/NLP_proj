Think of all the things that money can buy
Like a ranch in the mountains or a pleasure for your eye
Then think of all the things that a dollar bill won't bring
Like someone to hold you close and a song for you to sing

Then think of all the years that it takes to be a fool
Like the lessons you learn in a lifetime like your lifetime was a school
And then think of all the things that don't turn out what they seem
Like the love that you thought you owned in the American dream

The American dreamer sometimes a thinker sometimes a schemer
Sometimes a child sometimes a wise man
A lonely sole, great extremer
But none the less the American Dreamer
