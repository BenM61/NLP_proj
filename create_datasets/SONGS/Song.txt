Song, music that seemed to blur
All that my heart would say
Song, you didn't change our tune
You didn't end too soon

Love is forever, still you play on in my heart
Each note really tears me apart
How could a love so right go wrong?

How can I learn to let go?
Your words keep on haunting me so
Love is forever, love is forever

Song, tell her and make her see
She is my life to me
And all that is left of a beautiful love
Is a beautiful love song

Still you play on in my heart
Each note really tears me apart
How could a love so right go wrong?

How can I learn to let go?
Your words keep on haunting me so
Love is forever, love is forever

Song, tell her and make her see
She is my life to me
And all that is left of a beautiful love
Is a beautiful love song
