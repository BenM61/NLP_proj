Stunnas on

Stunaas on
Stunnas on, got my stunnas on 
Stunnas on, got my stunnas on

You'll never catch me without my stunnas on
I be on that green I be cheifen mean forgot my Vsine
But I got my stunnas on they don't wanna let me in the club wit em on
Say i'm lookin' like a thug wit em on (wit em on)
I take em off I get in and put em right back on
You'll never catch yo boy without his stunnas on

Big whips or rocks we goin' get 'em
Loose lips ain't leavin' out now we wit 'em
Any top notch dime in ya city we wit 'em
Don't stop late night till the morn keep the stunnas on
If its fresh or flashy yes we wit it
Got kicks so quick the first to go get it
Before u approach that dyme prolly already hit it
Don't waist time steady on my grind wit ma stunnas on

Now we sailin' in the mall homie ice got it all

Hands b turnin' so fast who's dat wit dem stunnas on
My eyes tinted got a lean in the lac
Let a nigga look g in the lac

Loose lips ain't leavin' out now we wit 'em
Any top notch dime in ya city we wit em
Don't stop late night till the morn keep the stunnas on

Got kicks so quick the first to go get it
Before u approach that dime prolly already hit it
Don't waist time steady on my grind wit ma stunnas on

Wood grain frame wit my name in the shades
And when I wanna switch it up I put dem garda d's on
Same stunnas wood goin' now they all chrome

Shorty say she love it so she let a niggas beat in 'em
Its a important part of my attire apart of my fresh
I cant leave home without 'em like my american express

Hit the mall man every day buy some
The bigger the better the harder to stunt
He ain't doin' it like me baby tell 'em stop frontin'

Like this big whips or rocks we gon get em
Loose lips ain't leavin' out now we wit em
Any top notch dime in ya city we wit em
Don't stop late night till the morn keep the stunnas on
If its fresh or flashy yes we wit it
Got kicks so quick the first to go get it
Before you approach that dime prolly already hit it
Don't waist time steady on my grind wit ma stunnas on
