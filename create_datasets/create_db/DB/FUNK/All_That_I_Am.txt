I can't buy you fancy rings
Or all of the expensive things you're used to  baby
No trips around the world  no diamonds or pearls
To give to you  baby
But what I've got a give is more precious
Than you'll ever know
My deepest inner feelings  my heart and soul

Cause all that I am  is a man in love with you
Cause all that I am  is a man who's heart is true
And in love with you

Oh baby
Oh girl, yeah, yeah
Girl I know you're not blind
Cause when I look into your eyes, you meet me half way
Yes you do
Just accept me as I am
Try to understand, that I want you always
Just give me the chance and I'll show you
The world my love, yeah, yeah
My deepest inner feeling, my heart and soul
yeah yeah yeah

Denying all you aren't
I know you have your doubts about me (your doubts about me)
Just put them all aside
And follow where your heart leads

Cause all that I am is a man who loves you
All that I am is a man whose heart is true
Cause all that I am is a man who loves you
Man in love with you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
Man in love with you
