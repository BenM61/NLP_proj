If you want to be my friend
You want us to get along
Please do not expect me to
Wrap it up and keep it there 
The observation I am doing could
Easily be understood
As cynical demeanor
But one of us misread

And what do you know
It happened again 

A friend is not a means
You utilize to get somewhere
Somehow I didn't notice
Friendship is an end
What do you know
It happened again 

How come no-one told me
All throughout history
The loneliest people
Were the ones who always spoke the truth
The ones who made a difference
By withstanding the indifference
I guess it's up to me now
Should I take that risk or just smile? 

What do you know
It happened again 
What do you know
