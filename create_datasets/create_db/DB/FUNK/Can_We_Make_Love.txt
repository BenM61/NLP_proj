Girl girl girl girl
I know that it's late and you're probably asleep
It's so good to hear your voice although it's on a machine
My baby's taken off but tomorrow I'll be home
And although the love is gone I still feel you're the one

I realize it's over but honey I thought maybe you and me could make love
It's not a crime to show that you feel for somebody
Can we make love?

I been waitin' for you I'm glad that you came
Thanks for returnin' my message
How do you like the new place?
You see it's kinda lonely
Can't you tell it's kinda lonely?
Girl without you I am nothing
Baby let me tell you something oh I...

I realize it's over but honey I thought maybe you and me could make love
It's not a crime to show that you feel for somebody
Can we make love?

I realize it's over but honey I thought maybe you and me could make love
It's not a crime to show that you feel for somebody
Can we make love?

Now Lady open your heart and just show me
(baby show me what you're feelings are)
And I'll dearly surrender to you
Girl I can't rest until you are back in...my life!

I realize it's over but honey I thought maybe you and me could make love
It's not a crime to show that you feel for somebody
Can we make love?

Break it down...Profyle help me sing...Can we make love?
