Baby I've been searching
Searching through these crowds
To make my find someone who knows what I'm about
All these excuses, too young to settle down
So it's crazy what you got me doing now

Hold up baby
You know you drive me crazy
And I want everybody to know

I'm down
Nobody's looking right now
Ain't not time for messing around
But it won't take a minute
Baby come kiss me quick
The satire feeling right here
Make this unforgettable
Baby come kiss me quick

No we don't know what tomorrow's gonna bring
So don't put the pause when giving everything
You got me hooked on your VDA
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Before you go away

Hold up baby
You know you drive me crazy
And I want everybody to know

I'm down
Nobody's looking right now
Ain't not time for messing around
But it won't take a minute
Baby come kiss me quick
The satire feeling right here
Make this unforgettable, yeah
Baby come kiss me quick

Kiss me quick baby
Kiss me quick baby
Kiss me quick baby
Baby come kiss me quick

Put your lips right here
Then your body will follow
Put your hands on my face
Don't worry about tomorrow
Make sure you're feeling that magic
Before you disappear
You got me baby, you got me baby

I'm down
Nobody's looking right now
Ain't not time for messing around
But it won't take a minute
Baby come kiss me quick
The satire feeling right here
Make this unforgettable, yeah
Baby come kiss me quick

Kiss me quick baby
Kiss me quick baby
Kiss me quick baby
Baby come kiss me quick
