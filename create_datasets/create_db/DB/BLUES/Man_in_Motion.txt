Still life is overrated
Burn-out factor is part of the game
Life should be an adventure
Anything else is a crying shame
People gather round to see
Day by day

Just what he's gonna be
He's here, he's gone
He's moving on
What do you expect the boy to do
He's just a fire burning

A storm passing through
Proceed with caution
He's a man in motion
Hard to say when the motion began
Big time dreams in a
Small town man

Some days peace of mind
Is all you hope to find
Folks back home wouldn't understand
Moving town to town
Band to band

You say someday you're gonna stop
But they keep moving the finish line
What do you expect the boy to do

He's just a fire burning
A storm passing through
Proceed with caution
He's a man in motion

His life has been a race
Love of the game thrill of the chase
It's only 8 seconds but you live for the ride
What do you expect the boy to do
What do you expect the boy to do
He's just a fire burning

A storm passing through
Proceed with caution
Proceed with caution
Proceed with caution
He's a man in motion
