It's funny how the whole thing started
But you found your way into my heart
I always figured that you were innocent, girl
And it was plain to see that you'd been hurt

I can't be your saviour
I'll never erase the past
I can't overlook what you've done
Look what you've done
You say you want to change but you can't, yeah

I've been taking a cold look - a cold look
And I don't like what I see
I'm taking a cold look - a cold look
Your love's been hurting me
I'm taking a cold look - yeah - cold look

Sometimes I don't express my feelings
I can't expect you to guess
But this hasn't been fun for such a long time
And I just can't go on like this

Now don't try to hold me
Don't say we'll make it one last time
I'm gonna make a clean break
Admit my mistake
'Cause this is killing me inside, yeah

I've been taking a cold look - a cold look
And I don't like what I see
I'm taking a cold look - a cold look
Your love's been hurting me
I've been taking a cold look

I've been holding it back too long

Cold look, Cold look
Ooh, and I don't like what I see

I'm taking a long hard look
How your love's been hurting me
Taking a cold look, yeah
I don't like what I see
Your love's been hurting me
I've been taking a cold look,
A long hard look
Your love's been hurting me
