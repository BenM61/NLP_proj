Well I get up in the morning
Kick the covers from my bed
The sunlight in my eyes
Playin' tricks on my head
I work like a dog
On the job every day
Tryin' to make some money
So I can go and play

In the night time
Oh that's the right time
I say the night time
That's the right time
I wanna be with you
In the night time

Well I come home from work
You know I'm tired of the beat
I try to make some supper
Get myself something to eat
I jump in the shower
Wash the world off my back
I'm gonna get you baby
That's a natural fact

In the night time
Oh that's the right time
I say the night time
That's the right time
I wanna be with you
In the night time

Ah come here baby
Got your radio turned down too low
Turn it up so you can hear what I'm saying baby
Now you got me turned on baby

Well eight hundred million people
With nothing to say
They run around in circles
They just living the day
Stick with me baby
I'll show you how to fly
We'll make some pretty music
Watch the world go by

In the night time
Oh that's the right time
I say the night time
That's the right time
I wanna be with you
In the night time
