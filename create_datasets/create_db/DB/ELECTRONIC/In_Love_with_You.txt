I'm in love with you
I know I saw you yesterday
But there's so much I want to say
Can't seem to shake off feeling strange
All my emotions rearranged
I'm twisted up inside
You give me butterflies
There's something in your eyes, and now I know that

I'm in love with you, in love with you, in love with you
I'm in love with you, in love with you, in love with you

I can't remember what I said
Too many thoughts went through my head
If I believe this love is real
I should show you how I feel
I'm twisted up inside
You give me butterflies
There's something in your eyes, and now I know that

I'm in love with you, in love with you, in love with you
I'm in love with you, in love with you, in love with you
