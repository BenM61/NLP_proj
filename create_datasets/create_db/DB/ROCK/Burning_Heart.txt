Does it feel the same
When he calls your name
And does it feel the same
When you play the game
Of love 

When he holds you tight
Does it feel alright
Just like it used to do
When I was with you
Making love to you 

This burning heart of mine
It still hurts after all this time
This burning heart in me
Won't let me be 

After all this time
You still haunt my mind
I just can't seem to find
The peace of mind
I need so bad 

Does it feel the same
When he calls your name
And does it feel the same
When you play the game
Of love 

This burning heart of mine
It still hurts after all this time
This burning heart in me
Won't let me be
Won't let me be 

This burning heart of mine
It still hurts after all this time
This burning heart in me
Won't let me be 

Solo 

This burning heart of mine
It still hurts after all this time
This burning heart in me
Won't let me be
Won't let me be 

This burning heart of mine
It still hurts after all this time
This burning heart in me
Won't let me be 

Oooh, won't you let me be
