My left side, feel so heavy
Feet that ain't steady
Feels like my heart is givin' up
How come I'm
So heart headed, so forgiving
Forgetting how you bring me down

Who's gonna pick me up?
Who's gonna give a f*ck? Ooh whoah
Who's gonna go the mile?
Fly me to the clouds?

I'm singing love
Don't fail me now, don't count me out
Oh love
Don't let me down, come back around, hey

It's like a jungle sometimes
It make me wonder how I keep on going under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It make me wonder how I keep on going under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It make me wonder how I keep on going under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It make me wonder how I keep on going under

My vision, so misleading
Me believing
In things I never saw
Deep inside
When I right now
Things got different
Oh it's not what we thought, no

Who's gonna pick me up?
Who's gonna give a f*ck? Ooh whoah
Who's gonna go the mile?
Fly me to the clouds?

I'm singing love
Don't fail me now, don't count me out
Oh love
Don't let me down, come back around, hey

It's like a jungle sometimes
It make me wonder how I keep on going under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It make me wonder how I keep on going under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It make me wonder how I keep on going under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It make me wonder how I keep on going under

Everyday, it's a fight
Sinking fast, going down
I just wanna get back right
So I need you out of my life

I'm singing love
Don't fail me now, don't count me out
Oh love
Don't let me down, come back around

It's like a jungle sometimes
It make me wonder how I keep on going under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It make me wonder how I keep on going under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It make me wonder how I keep on going under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It make me wonder how I keep on going under
