You told me I would never see you walk away
Said you'd never break my heart
Never leave me in the dark
I guess there's just some promises you shouldn't make
Should've known from the start

Now I'm in the dark
Show a little loving
Shine a little light on me
Show a little loving
Shine a little light on me
Show a little loving
Shine a little light on me
Show a little loving

I'm in the dark
I can't see
Can't see it
Can't see it
Feeling my way back to you
I can't feel
Can't feel it
Can't feel it

Reach out and show a little loving
Shine a little light on me
Show a little loving
Shine a little light on me

I'm in the dark
Show a little loving
Shine a little on me
Show a little loving
Show a little loving

You told me I would never see you go astray
Said we'd never be apart
Never leave me in the dark
I guess there's just some promises you shouldn't make
Should've known from the start

I'm in the dark
I can't see
Can't see it
Can't see it
Just feeling my way back to you
I can't feel
Can't feel it
Can't feel it

Reach out and show a little loving
Shine a little light on me
Show a little loving
Shine a little light on me

I'm in the dark
Show a little lovin'
Shine a little light on me
Show a little loving

I can't see
Can't see it
Can't see it
Just feeling my way back to you
I can't feel
Can't feel it
Can't feel it

Reach out and show a little loving
Shine a little light on me
Show a little loving
Shine a little light on me

I'm in the dark
Show a little loving
Shine a little light on me
Show a little loving
Show a little loving
