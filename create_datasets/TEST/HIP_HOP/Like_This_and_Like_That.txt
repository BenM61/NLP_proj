Ooh, baby
Ooh oh, yea yea 

I just can't keep on going
I'm falling in love with you
I need to know if you want me for sure
We messed around for too long 
I need a commitment
To make me feel I belong to someone 

So if you'd like to 
Then this is your chance to I'm moving on without you
Gotta find another in me
You say you want me
Then you better show me 
Come 'on and get to know me 
And then you will find that I want you
And I feel the same
We ought to be sure I know by now
But if we can prove our love

Like this and like that I gonna move along
Like this and like that (yea)
Like this and like that (like this and like that)
Like this and like that (ooh)
Like this and like that I'm gonna move along

You are that special to me
Don't want to lose you no
I've gotten used to the way we hang out
No way to understand me
You said one day we'll be
But I can't wait around to see

So if you like to
Then this is your chance to
I'm moving on without you
Gotta find another baby (ah ah)
You said you want me
Then you better show me

I feels a whoop comin' on 'cause
I feels a whoop comin' on 'cause
I said whoops there it was
?
It goes, engine engine, who's the Gemini
But it's the Mr. and the Mrs. brothas and sistas it goes
Like that and like this as conflict kicks flows
It was one of those days not much to do
So what I strut to the mall just to buy a thing or two
I met a wise guy playing the harmonica
By him was Foxy Brown, slow down, she says "I'm Monica"
Monica? Oh yeah, Monica so she say
I be the M-A-L-I-K
Excuse Miss Thang, my god you look smooth
Put away your loot you all in with me boo
She said "oh no, 'cause I'd rather a bore of you 
Not to get on your nerves but haven't you served a star or two?
Only the ones with no class, the ones with no shape
Shine on em like a diamond in the rain off the window pane
It spittin' on your kitten, can I slob it too?
Of course I got the sauce to put on the barbecue
Well if tonight is tonight like Betty Wright
Can I see you as I dig you ? out of sight
Well I say honey ? as it seems but I must reveal
You're that chocolate ? doctor with that sex appeal, that's you

So if you'd like to 
Then this is your chance to I'm moving on without you
Gotta find another in me
You say you want me
Then you better show me 
Come 'on and get to know me 
And then you will find that I want you
And I feel the same
We ought to be sure I know by now
But if we can prove our love
