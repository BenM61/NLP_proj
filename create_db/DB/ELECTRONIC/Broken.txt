Between the searching and the need to work it out
I stop believing everything will be alright
Broken
We are broken
I'm walking uphill being turned around and round
Secret in motion when my feet are on the ground
Broken
We are broken
In my mind's eye
One little boy anger one little man
Funny how time flies
