When I couldn't see you for the wall
What was that you said?
What was that you said, before you called?

And when I couldn't catch you for the fall
What was that you said?
What was that you said?

"Nothing hurts this much"

But I've seen the way
That bodies lie
And bodies tend to break

And I've been away
I've been away too long
Too long to be afraid

But you know
What you know is better
Is brighter

And you know
You know
What you know is better
Is brighter

And this is where we were, when I showed you the dark
Inside of me, in spite of me
On a bench in the park
You said to me:

"This is not you
This is not you..
This is not you!"

But I've seen the way
That bodies lie
And bodies tend to break

And I've been away
I've been away too long
And I don't know a better place

(Chorus)

And this is where we are
In your bed, in my arms
Outside of me
In spite of, 'we'

I showed you the dark
And you said to me:

"You know
What you know is better
Is brighter"

"And you know, you know
What you know is better
Is brighter"
