Dream on dreamer life gets in your way
Dream on dreamer life gets in your way

There you go day and night
Up in the clouds flying so high
You try your best to stretch your mind
Beyond reality and sense and rhyme
You see things that make you big heart sing
Like the flowers trees and birds and pretty things
Hate to put your two feet on the ground
You like to step aside
And release yourself and fly

Dream on dreamer life gets in your way
If the life you live is a spinning top of pain then you can
Dream on dreamer life gets in your way
If ya live to learn you'll be lucky one day

Now the paisley pages of your mind
Are so complete like seeing colours black and white
Do you realize that you look so spaced out
You've made your peace with the need to be free
Without a doubt
Yeah I frown 'cause something don't look right
It's the twinkly twinkle start that's in your eyes
Hate to put your two feet on the ground
You like to step aside
And release yourself and fly

Dream on dreamer life gets in your way
If the life you live is a spinning top of pain then you can
Dream on dreamer life gets in your way
If ya live to learn you'll be lucky one day
You know you gotta
Dream on dreamer life gets in your way
If the life you live is a spinning top of pain then you can
Dream on dreamer life gets in your way
If ya live you'll be lucky one day

Over over over and over
Over over over and over
Over over over and over
Over over over and over

Dream on dreamer life gets in your way
If the life you live is a spinning top of pain then you can
Dream on dreamer life gets in your way
If ya live to learn you'll be lucky one day

Over over over and over
Over over over and over
Over over over and over
Over over over and over

Dream on dreamer over over over and over
Dream on dreamer over over over and over
Dream on dreamer over over over and over
Dream on dreamer over over over and over
