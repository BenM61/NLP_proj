I ain't goin' down that big road by myself 
I ain't goin' down that big road by myself 
If I can't carry my baby, gon' carry somebody else 

Sun don't shine in my back door somedays 
Sun don't shine in my back door somedays 
Big wind gonna blow up, take my blues away 

(???)
Reach in the corner mama hand me my travelin shoes
you know I got them big road blues

Sun gonna shine in my back door someday
The sun gonna shine in my back door someday 
Big wind gonna blow up, take my blues away 

I ain't goin' down that big road by myself
I said I ain't goin' down that big road by myself
If I can't carry my baby, gon' carry somebody else
