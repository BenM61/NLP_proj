Breaking Away
Balance

No chance to keep me waiting
Can't explain 
You know I've been saying that
Someday soon you know I'll be breaking away
Every night you try to change me
Its not right, I feel you caging me
Don't tie me down
Cause you know I'll be breaking away
I'm breaking away
Ooh
I'm breaking away
Ooh
I'm breaking away
Ooh
I'm breaking away
There's not doubt about my leaving
I'm checkin' out cause I've been feelin' that
I should leave
And so I'll be breaking away
Just in case you think I'm foolin'
Don't chase its only proving
That I should leave
And so I'll be breaking away
I'm breaking away
Ooh
I'm breaking away
Ooh
I'm breaking away
No chance to keep me waiting
I can't explain you know I've been saying that
Its coming soon
You know I'll be breaking away
I'm breaking away
Ooh
I'm breaking away
Ooh
I'm breaking away
Yeah
I'm breaking away
Ooh

Ooh
