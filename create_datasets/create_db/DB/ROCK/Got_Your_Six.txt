Charge

I'm a fucking soldier
Just like I told ya
While I'm just warming up
You're getting colder
Out on the battleground
Let's take a look around
Well there's a million of us ready to throw down

They'll never take me alive

In the pit
Blood on the bricks
Don't look back 'cause I got your six
Won't go down, never gonna quit
Don't turn back 'cause I got your six

You know I got your back
They'll never take that
Until the bitter end
You know I'll never crack
I'll face an army
Can't fucking harm me
Out on the front line
That's where you'll find me
They'll never take me alive

In the pit
Blood on the bricks
Don't look back 'cause I got your six
Won't go down, never gonna quit
Don't turn back 'cause I got your six

I will never accept defeat and I will never quit

I got your six

I got your six

In the pit
Blood on the bricks
Don't look back 'cause I got your six
Won't go down, never gonna quit
Don't turn back 'cause I got your six

In the pit
Blood on the bricks
Don't look back 'cause I got your six
Won't go down, never gonna quit
Don't turn back 'cause I got your six
