We'll be having fun
Under the golden sun
Christmas in Jamaica here we come
We'll just sail on, just sail

Toni Braxton
Mister Boombastic
Just call me Santa Claus
Lovers frolickin'
Playin' in the sand
Got my Coppertone
Getting on my tan

Exotic setting for a
Lady and her man
A perfect little holiday
Sounds like a plan

We can stay in bed all afternoon
We can make out to some cool reggae tunes
We can sail under the light of the moon
Wish we could freeze this moment
Then it wouldn't end so soon

We'll be having fun
Under the golden sun
Christmas in Jamaica here we come
We'll just sail on, just sail

We'll be having fun
Under the golden sun
Christmas in Jamaica here we come
We'll just sail on, just sail

Unplug the phones, why'all
Don't need no calls
No callin' home
Take a break from it all

'Cause we both grown
And we can do whatever, see?
Baby, it's just you and me
Let's live out a fantasy

Hiking in the mountains, romantic rendezvous
Bathing in the fountains, stop, let me look at you
Just in case you're doubtin', let me paint a view
Picture you're in heaven, everything is true

We'll be having fun
Under the golden sun
Christmas in Jamaica here we come
We'll just sail on, just sail

We'll be having fun
Under the golden sun
Christmas in Jamaica here we come
We'll just sail on, just sail

It's Christmas time let's catch the vibe
Just come on come on girl
I'm rockin' you Jamaican style
Just come on come on girl
We can chill here for a while
Come on come on girl
Baby it's just you and me girl
Come on come on, it's a fantasy
Just come on come on girl
Toni Braxton, shut it
Come on come on, it's a fantasy

We'll be having fun
Under the golden sun
Christmas in Jamaica here we come
We'll just sail on, just sail

We'll be having fun
Under the golden sun
Christmas in Jamaica here we come
We'll just sail on, just sail

You know when you come to this Jamaica
Lovin' it
I'm an all nighter, girl
Yeah girl, it's an all nighter
Sing it to me girl
We'll be having fun
Under the golden sun
Christmas in Jamaica here we come
We'll just sail on, just sail

We'll be having fun
Under the golden sun
Christmas in Jamaica here we come
We'll just sail on, just sail

We'll be having fun
Under the golden sun
Christmas in Jamaica here we come
We'll just sail on, just sail

We'll be having fun
Under the golden sun
Christmas in Jamaica here we come
We'll just sail on, just sail
