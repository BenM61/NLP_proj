I'm looking for a miracle man that tells me no lies
I'm looking for a miracle man who's not in disguise

I don't know where he'll come from and I don't know where he's been
But he's not our Jimmy sinner because he's so obscene

Miracle man got busted, miracle man got busted

Today i saw a miracle man, on TV cryin'
Such a hypocritical man, born again, dying

He don't know where he's goin' but we know where he's been
It was out little Jimmy sinner 
Our eyes are on the screen

Miracle man got busted, miracle man got busted, miracle
man got busted, miracle man

A devil with a crucifix
Brimstone and fire
He needs another carnal fix
To take him higher and higher
Now Jimmy, he got busted with his pants down
Repent ye wretched sinners, self righteous clown

Miracle man got busted, miracle man got busted, miracle
man got busted, miracle man got busted, miracle man got
busted, miracle man got busted, miracle man got busted
