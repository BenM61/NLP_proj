[Intro:]
Yeah, On behalf of Chamillitary Entertainment
I'd like to extent my deepest apologies
To anyone who feels they are offended by the following content
Now that we done with all of the nonsense
If you know you ain't a groupie, make some noise

[Chorus]
G-R-O-U-P-I-E
Told me that she ain't a freak x2
G-R-O-U-P-I-E
Told me that she ain't a freak x2
Baby, You was kinda high maintenance to me
Spent my paper but you let my partner sleep with you for free
Baby, I thought you were in love with me
But obviously, your just a groupie (Groupie Love!)

[Verse 1:]
See, I got a clue when Young Dro said his girlfriend got a girlfriend
That girlfriend of his girlfriend had Chamillionaire as her man
Then T-Pain said he was sprung, said he had fell in love with a stripper
I shoulda known that you was the stripper that was on the pole tuggin on his zipper
Kanye said that you was a gold digger, You always wanted to be major paid
I turned on my TV and then I seen you kissin on Flava Flav
We was both fans of UGK, we was both dreaming bout ridin blades
While I was dreaming, you was gettin laid on everybodys bed and I was getting played
Yung Joc knew that we was through, said he knew he didn't stand a chance
You stood still while my song played and his came on and you did his dance
You kept begging me for romance, I kept telling you that's enough
You turned on my boy Juvenile and then proceeded to back that up
Pitbull said 'Culo!' and I ain't even that good at Spanish
But I knew he was talking to you, I was down with you so I couldn't stand it
Don't try to lie, Don't try to cry, Ain't nothing more for us to talk about
Like Unk told ya take 2-Steps towards the door and just walk it out

[Chorus]
G-R-O-U-P-I-E
Told me that she ain't a freak x2

G-R-O-U-P-I-E
Told me that she ain't a freak x2
Baby, You was kinda high maintenance to me
Spent my paper but you let my partner sleep with you for free
Baby, I thought you were in love with me
But obviously, your just a groupie (Groupie Love!)

[Verse 2:]
Gave Bun B a little groupie love, you gave Pimp C a little groupie love
And then you bumped into the whole Screwed Up Click and gave every member in the group a hug
Even messed with my boy Slim Thug, he pulled up, you had a heart attack
You tried to mess with Game and 50 but neither one of em called you back
Ask J.R., my car was pushed to the limit on Cool & Dre
Plus Rick Ross was Hustlin' that money outcha like everyday
You knew that I loved you was them three words that I'd never say
Now your business all over the radio and its the penalty that you have to pay
You made the choice to go and be a freak, even had Akon been smacking that
Her plan was to get ran through by a linebacker or a quarterback
R Kelly didn't have to tell me about your bump-n-grind and your foreplay
I found out and I asked you if this was true, you said no way
Birdman said 'Believe Dat!', T.I.P. was like 'Shawty!'
Then Young Jeezy said 'That's Right!' and Lil' Jon said 'Okay!'
Heard you was messin with Ray J, you did a flick is what they say
I ain't even wanna look at the tape until P.Diddy said Press Play

[Chorus]
G-R-O-U-P-I-E
Told me that she ain't a freak x2
G-R-O-U-P-I-E
Told me that she ain't a freak x2
Baby, You was kinda high maintenance to me
Spent my paper but you let my partner sleep with you for free
Baby, I thought you were in love with me
But obviously, your just a groupie (Groupie Love!)
