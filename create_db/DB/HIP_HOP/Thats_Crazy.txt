Y'all ain't ready (the saga continues)
The tootsie roll (we still here, keep it up, keep it up)
Yo, pd, bad boy, alumni, Br (keep it up, keep, keep, keep it up)

I had this bad bitch uptown, she was whoa! (oh that's crazy)
Almost had me pushing up daisies (oh that's crazy)
Had some big nigga with keys to the crib (oh that's crazy)
Just came home from doing a bid (oh that's crazy)
Now how you ain't gon' change the locks? (oh that's crazy)
Didn't sit there and call the cops (oh that's crazy)
Got up out the back door like whoa! (oh that's crazy)
Hop in the excursion with sixteen wheels (oh that's crazy)
Yeah you love it how we huggin' the curb (oh that's crazy)
Plus it's jumpin' off up in the spot (oh that's crazy)
Boobie cat, lapdance with kid (oh that's crazy)
Plus the similin' chick put in the bid (oh that's crazy)
Now the driver smoking chron' (oh that's crazy)
If he crash, then we all gone (oh that's crazy)
F*ck it, pump the sound to ten (oh that's crazy)
Catch br on the cover of spin (oh that's crazy)

[Chorus]
Man it's alright, hold tight
Watch out, push it on tonight
It's crazy
Don't hold back
I'ma put it where it 'pose to be at
And that's non-stop and party-hoppin', it's on

Just broke up where this kid is stayin' (oh that's crazy)
Cause I found out he was a one minute man (oh that's crazy)
I'm like, dad, can you get my freak on? (oh that's crazy)
Cause he couldn't last one minute long (oh that's crazy)
I'm like boy, don't you know I'm addictive? (oh that's crazy)
Admit this the lines that I spit is ridiculous (oh that's crazy)
Oh, how dare he play me (oh that's crazy)
Told him next time he want to f*ck me, pay me (oh that's crazy)
Cause I been waiting too damn long (oh that's crazy)
And I know if ya scared bring that tired ass home (oh that's crazy)
Oh, man ya know that's crazy (oh that's crazy)
I need to find out if ya feel what I'm saying (oh that's crazy)

[Chorus]

You had the nerve to say I had a gun (oh that's crazy)
Man for twelve years I had to run (oh that's crazy)
And ain't a threat in my family, dog (that's crazy)
Courthouse got my name in the law (oh that's crazy)
And they ain't care if my name Sean John? (oh that's crazy)
Or about the movie star chick on my arm (oh that's crazy)
Even had foul shit to say to my moms (oh that's crazy)
They even called the office to say it's a bomb (oh that's crazy)
But yet, I'm supposed to be so calm? (oh that's crazy)
Tavis smiley, I killed him with the charm (oh that's crazy)
Yeah, looked like there wasn't nothin' wrong (oh that's crazy)
That's how it is when you in the game so long (oh that's crazy)
Man, we been had the keys to the city (oh that's crazy)
From now on, it's no puff, just Diddy (oh that's crazy)
Man, new york never looked so pretty (oh that's crazy)
Can't picture NY without no Diddy (oh that's crazy), oh no!

[Chorus]

Yo, how dep ain't on, that's crazy (oh that's crazy)
Man, I wouldn't miss this if ya paid me (oh that's crazy)
Come through man, pop the lock (oh that's crazy)
F*ck cops, we watch the block (oh that's crazy)
Yo, we hustle when them cameras is hidden (oh that's crazy)
I did a bitch, still puttin' my bid in (oh that's crazy)
Shit, it's hard to get one red cent (oh that's crazy)
And they charging this high ass rent (oh that's crazy)
And now my back pocket starting to leak (oh that's crazy)
Somebody get this nigga something to eat (oh that's crazy)
I got a meal when I signed my deal (oh that's crazy)
Plus trains, planes, and automobiles (oh that's crazy)
Now the bank done stretching my credit (oh that's crazy)
Now the boobies got a g. dep fetish (oh that's crazy)
Thousand dollar honeys givin' me leather (oh that's crazy)
Over-respect due to "let's get it" (oh that's crazy)

[Chorus]

Waking up with a braud (oh that's crazy)
And I don't even know her name, dog (oh that's crazy)
I'm on the run from the law (oh that's crazy)
These fools runnin' up and chickens raw (oh that's crazy)
It's a g from the streets (oh that's crazy)
That fool working with the police (oh that's crazy)
Don't bring that fool around me no more (oh that's crazy)
And to think he tried to sell me some glo (oh that's crazy)
Good thing I had my head on straight (oh that's crazy)
So I'ma snake his little freak on a date (oh that's crazy)
Went straight to the mizzel, tizzel (oh that's crazy)
I drove straight past my hizzel, dizzel (oh that's crazy)
It's a slizzel nizzel fa shizzel (oh that's crazy)
On the wizzel fa dizzel (oh that's crazy)
I do a verse for a sweat suit and a g (oh that's crazy)
Cause it's all in the motherfucking family (oh that's crazy)

[Chorus: x3]
