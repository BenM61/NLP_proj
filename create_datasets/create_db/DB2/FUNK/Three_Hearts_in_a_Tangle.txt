Three hearts in a tangle
And one heart will have to break
Three hearts in a tangle
What will be the loser's fate

One heart, I'm tied to
And the other heart
Our love is true
Either way I go
I'll bring sorrow, yeah, and
One heart will be broken in two

If I had to choose
Either one of these hearts
Then the other heart
I'll surely break

And if I ever leave
I will suffer, yeah
And who's heart will
Pay for my mistake

Three hearts in a tangle
And one heart will have to break
Three hearts in a tangle
What will be the loser's fate

Now I sit by my window
I'm watching the people
Go dancing by and I'm
I'm trying to reach a decision
And I'm afraid I won't do what's right

Three hearts in a tangle
And one heart will have to break
Three hearts in a tangle
What will be the loser's fate

I want you to sing
A little bit louder

Three hearts in a tangle
And one heart will have to break
Three hearts in a tangle
What will be the loser's fate
