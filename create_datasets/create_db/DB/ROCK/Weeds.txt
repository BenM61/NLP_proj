If tomorrow never shows
I want you all to know
That I loved you all, you're beautiful
And I had myself a ball

I've wasted so much precious time
Been skating along these fine lines
Now these weeds have grown where the sun once shown
And my life has passed me by

And my life has passed me by
And I don't know why
I keep searching for something that I never found
While these weeds get deeper as I turn around

And time grows older and I've grown colder
So long has passed that I forgot to count

These weeds have grown where the sun once shown
And I can feel it

Today I cut off all the ties
Been led blind for all this time
But somewhere in between the lies
Are the hearts and minds of those who tried

And although I've heard your lies

This space between us
