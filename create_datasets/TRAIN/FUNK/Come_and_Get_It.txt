If you want the love of a man,
Come and get it (baby)
If you want the love of a man,
Come and get it

If you want the love of a real good man
Come and shout me
I make you understand
Don't you just look
Come and take it
Cause what I've got
You know you can't fake it

If you want the love of a man,
Come and get it
If you want the love of a man,
You got to get with it
If you want the love of a man,
Come and get it
If you want the love of a man,
You got to get with it

Listen
Remember girl, I've been around the block
My legs are shied, but I won't stop
It's your turn to make a choice
Don't just sit there girl
Stand up to raise your voice

If you want the love of a man,
Come and get it
If you want the love of a man,
You got to get with it
If you want the love of a man,
Come and get it
If you want the love of a man,
You got to get with it

All my love came tumbling down

Quite playing games
Beat around the bush
All that love really needs is
Just a little pitty push

If you want the love of a man,
Come and get it
If you want the love of a man,
You got to get with it
If you want the love of a man,
Come and get it
If you want the love of a man,
You got to get with it
If you want the love of a man,
Come and get it
If you want the love of a man,
You got to get with it
If you want the love of a man,
Come and get it
If you want the love of a man,
You want to get with it
