I don't think that it's gonna rain again today
There's a devil at your side but an angel on her way

Someone hit the light 'cause there's more here to be seen
When you caught my eye, I saw everywhere I'd been and wanna go to

You came on your own, that's how you'll leave
With hope in your hands and air to breathe

I won't disappoint you as you fall apart
Some things should be simple; even an end has a start

Someone hit the light 'cause there's more here to be seen
When you caught my eye, I saw everywhere I'd been and wanna go to

You came on your own, that's how you'll leave
With hope in your hands and air to breathe

You'll lose everything by the end
Still my broken limbs you find time to mend

More and more people I
Know are getting ill
Pull something good from the
Ashes, now be still

You came on your own, that's how you'll leave
With hope in your hands and air to breathe

You lose everything by the end
Still my broken limbs you choose to mend

You came on your own, that's how you'll leave
You came on your own, that's how you'll leave

You came on your own
You came on your own
