Don't rescue me
When I play with with fire
Don't need to know
Is this desire

We hold back words
Our eyes are giving away
Deny the past
We've come to radiate

In need of some substance
In need of some substance
A little's less than nothing
In need of some substance

The sun might set
Tonight could be the night
And if that's the case
You'll get on all right

But there's no point
In spoiling for a fight
Because we're blinded by
The darkest ray of light
