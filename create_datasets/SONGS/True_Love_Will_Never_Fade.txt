True love will never fade
True love will never fade
True love will never fade
True love will never fade
True love will never fade

I wonder if there's no forever
No walking hand in hand
Down a yellow brick road
To never never land
These days I get to where I'm going
Make it there eventually
Follow the trail of breadcrumbs
To where I'm meant to be
To where I'm meant to be

I don't know what brought you to me
That was up to you
There's so many come to see me
Who want their own tattoo
I fixed a needle in a holder
Laid my hand upon your spine
And there upon your shoulder
I drew the picture as your sign
When I think about us
I see the picture that we made
The picture to remind us

True love will never fade
True love will never fade
True love will never fade
True love will never fade

I worked the rowdies and daytrippers
Now and then I think of you
Any which way we're all shufflin'
Forward in the queue
They like to move my operation
They like to get me off the pier
And I dream I'm on a steamer
Pullin' out of here

When I think about us
I see a picture that we made
The picture to remind us

True love will never fade
True love will never fade
True love will never fade
True love will never fade
True love will never fade
True love will never fade
