Because of you, because of you 
Even though I said we're through 
It's all because of you, Nikki 

She told me she would always be there 
And I believed her, believed her 
This girl was no good for me 
She had so many secrets, secrets, yeah 
Even though she wasn't my main girl 
I was still committed, it was me and you 
You said you wouldn't tell 
But you saved my voice mails 
But I always knew 

So now cry 'till you drown your face 
And bitch I give a damn how harsh this may seem 
I'm here to put your heart in its place 
Chained up at the bottom of the lake 

Now let the waterfall, abyss.
Now let the waterfall, abyss. 
Now let the waterfall, abyss. 
Now let the waterfall, abyss. 
Now let the waterfall, abyss. 
Now let the waterfall, abyss. 
Now let the waterfall, abyss. 
Now let the waterfall, abyss. 

I was the innocent bystander 
She had etiquette, she had good manners 
Pretty little thing, great little body 
Never in magazines, never at after parties 
And I could sense it then, but it didn't matter 
As long as me and you were together 
Thought it was better than that 
I'll never let you back to me 
Tell your boy at US weekly 
I sent your photos to T-M-Z 

Now cry 'till you drown your face 
And bitch I could give a damn how harsh this may seem 
But I'm here to put your heart in its place 
Chained up at the bottom of the lake 

Now let the waterfall, abyss.
Now let the waterfall, abyss.
Now let the waterfall, abyss. 
Now let the waterfall, abyss. 
Now let the waterfall, abyss. 
Now let the waterfall, abyss. 
Now let the waterfall, abyss. 
Now let the waterfall, abyss. 
Now let the waterfall, abyss. 

If only the sun would come 
And dry the water away 
But you're in the abyss, my lady 
And you wont see another day 

Now cry till you drown your face 
And bitch I could give a damn how harsh this may seem 
But I'm here to put your heart in its place (uh) 
Chained up at the bottom of the lake 
Now let the water fall 

If only the sun would come (water fall) 
And dry the water away (now let the water fall) 
(now let the water fall) 
(now let the water fall) 
(now let the water fall) 
(now let the water fall) 
(now let the water fall) 
(now let the water fall) 
(now let the water fall) 
(now let the water fall) 
(now let the water fall) 
But you're in the abyss, my lady 
And you won't see another day
And you won't see another day
And you won't see another day
And you won't see another day

Oh damn it baby 
Oh yeah baby 
Oh yeah baby
Oh yeah baby
You won't see it 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
Oh no, oh no 
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no 

If only the sun would come 
And dry the water away 
But you're in the abyss, my lady 
And you won't see another day
