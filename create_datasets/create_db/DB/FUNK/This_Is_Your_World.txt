This is your world, I'm just livin' in it
This is your world, I'm just livin' in it

I'm all wrapped up in you, baby
'Cause without you I couldn't live
Every moment, every moment we're away from each other
Happiness will fade and my sorrow will breathe

This is your world, I'm just livin' in it
This is your world, I'm just livin' in it

You're my sunshine and you are my rain
You can bring me joy or you can bring me pain
You control my very soul
What I like about your love, that it never grow old

This is your world, I'm just livin' in it
This is your world, I'm just livin' in it

A sad thing about it that I don't understand
How can a woman have so much power over a man?
If heaven can beat this, love, I'd wring her both hands
Oh you're in charge, mama, what a sweet command

This is your world, I'm just livin' in it
This is your world, I'm just livin' in it

This is your world, I'm just livin' in it
This is your world, I'm just livin' in it

This is your world, I'm just livin' in it
This is your world, I'm just livin' in it
