Much better off is my life since you came
And your heart spoke my name
Bringing me so much joy
From a lonely boy your love is me

Much better off friends
And neighbors say so
Just you and I and they know
You were made for me
Everyone can see your love is me

Much better off
Four words to define now
Since you said your mine now
It's my day right now
Let me say right now
Your love is me
