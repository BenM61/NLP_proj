There is no such place, 
O yes I have seen it too 
Just a little different from how you do, 
A river winding blue among the dunes 
And a marble bed 
A sun that doesn't set but settles. 
There is no such place. 
If I lower mine to yours 
Would you kiss me on the face? 
If you're looking for an unmarked place, 
There is no such place 

Blasted in appearance and 
A composite of fearful minutes 
Frozen in the waking instant 
Longing, things I long for, 
Peaceful nights, 
Strangers at the door, 
O come in, come in, 
You've been here before. 
There is no such place, 
So perhaps we have a reason 
For our long and falling face, 
Above all it would be warm 
But we would keep our heads all 
Clear as Winter, storms would be 
A sight to make us shiver 
But without the chill 
Of thinking all is hither-thither 

Longing, 
Things I long for, 
Peaceful nights, 
Strangers at the door, 
O come in, come through the door, 
You've been here before, 
You've been here before 
There is no such place, 
O yes I have seen it too 
Just a little different from how you do, 
A house upon a hill with no windows 
Just a can upon the sill 
To catch your tears 
To feed your garden.
