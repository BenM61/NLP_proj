Uh uh uh
I just gotta bring it to they attention dirty, that's all

You better watch who you talkin bout, runnin your mouth, like you know me
You gon' f*ck around and show why the "Show Me" get called the "Show Me"
Why one-on-one you can't hold me if your last name was Hanes
Only way you wear me out is stitch my name on your pants
No resident of France, but you swear I'm from Paris
Hundred-six karats, total? Naw that's per wrist
Trying to compare this, my chain to yo' chain
I'm like Sprint or Motorola, no service, out of your range
You out of your brains, thinkin' I'mma shout out your name
You gotta come up with better ways than that to catch your fame
All that pressure you applyin it's time to ease off
Before I hit you from the blindside takin' your sleeves off
As much as we's floss, still hard to please boss
Don't be lyin' bitchin' and cryin suck it up as a loss
'Cause your, acts is wack, your whole label is wack
And matter fact, eh eh-eh eh a-hold that

I am, number one, no matter if you like it
Here take it sit down and write it ey
I, am, number one ey ey, ey ey
Now let me ask you man
What does it take to be, number one?
Two is not a winner and three nobody remembers (ey)
What does it take to be, number one?
Ey ey, ey ey

Do you like it when I shake it for ya, daddy?
Move it all around?
Let you get a peep before it touches the ground?

Hell yeah ma I love a girl that's willin to learn
Willin to get in the driver's seat and willin to turn
And not concerned about that he say, she say, did he say
What I think he said? Squash that, he probably got that off eBay
Or some, Internet access some, website chat line
Mad 'cause I got mine, don't wind up on the flat line
Oh if my uncle could see me know
If he could see how many rappers wanna be me now
Straight emulatin my style right to the "down down"
Can't leave out the store now better wait 'til they calm down
I got hella shorties, comin' askin, "Yo where the party?"
Oh lordy, will I continue to act naughty?
Mixing Cris' and Bacardi, got me thinkin fo' sho'
I'm not a man of many words but there's one thing I know, PIMP

I am, number one, no matter if you like it
Here take it sit down and write it ey
I, am, number one ey ey, ey ey
And tell me now der
What does it take to be, number one?
Two is not a winner and three nobody remembers (ey)
(Tell me) What does it take to be, number one?
Ey ey, ey ey (Check it, uh, check, yo)

Aiyyo I'm tired of people judgin what's real Hip-Hop
Half the time you be them niggas who fuckin album flop
You know! Boat done sank and it ain't left the dock
C'mon! Mad 'cause I'm hot, he just, mad 'cause he not
You ain't gotta gimme my props, just gimme the yachts
Gimme my rocks, and keep my fans comin' in flocks
'Til you top the Superbowl, keep your mouth on lock
Shh
I'm awake
I'm cocky on the mic but I'm humble in real life
Taking nothin' for granted blessin' e'rything on my life
Tryin' to see a new light at the top of the roof
Baby name not Sigel but I speak the truth
I heat the booth, Nelly actin' so uncouth (so crazy)
Top down shirt off in the coupe, spreadin' the loot
With my family and friends, and my closest of kin
And I'll do it again if it means I'mma win dirty, dity

I, am, number one
No matter if you like it, here take it sit down and write it
I, I, I, I , number one
'Cause two is not a winner and three nobody remembers
Number one
'Cause two is not a winner and three nobody remembers

Girls say I miss you, cause my shit's official
They be all over my shit like Scottie tissue
The issue is I wish you stop sweatin' me, I quit you
Damn, I never shoulda hit you
They call me "Chocolate Lover" 10 inches of terror lovin'
I pull out my jimmy and bitches be like "You buggin', you buggin'"
But I ?????? and I leave it in pieces
Said my name was "Tone" but you still sayin' "Oh Jesus"
Check my resume, I should get paid for my lay
Got the type of sex to make Jennifer's Holiday, everyday
Releasing my fluid into it

Ain't no slackin' in my mackin'

[Red Hot Lover Tone]
Hey baby, we can do it

{Chorus #1} [Both together}
From the Kitchen to the Bedroom
To the Bathroom floor
Then Baby, hit the door
And when you're sure that you can't go no more
'Cause your poom poom's sore
Baby, hit the door
And when I'm fresh out of Jimmy hat's
I'm sayin' "that's I don't go raw"
So baby, hit the door
And when you can't be my lover
'Cause you love me and you want a lot more
Baby, hit the door....

{Chorus #2}
It's hard being the number 1 player (say what)
Hey, it's hard being the number 1 player (I can dig it)
It's hard being the number 1 player (mack on)
Baby, it's hard being the number 1 player

[Red Hot Lover Tone]
Yo, women never understand the way that I think
How I could hit the skins and wash my balls in your sink
I'm into freaky shit like women that inflate
My dick is insured 'cause I fucked in "All-States"
I'll take a blind date, and she's a fine mate
Pull out a condom, so she don't complain that "I'm late"
I'll be your "Almond Joy" if you feel like a nut
Mirros all around so I could watch my ass go up
And down and up and down, with sound
Ladies wet their panties whenever Red Hot's around
So come kiss the mister, it's the drifter
Who licks ya from your ass to your toe-jam, sister
When I'm erectness, check this
Let me cum on your neck and make a pearl sperm necklace
I'll lick your body if it's ashy, I'm nasty, ain't nothing to it
Let's run through it, we can do it

{Chorus #1} [Both together}
From the Kitchen to the Bedroom
To the Bathroom floor
Then Baby, hit the door
And when you're sure that you can't go no more
'Cause your poom poom's sore
Baby, hit the door
And when I'm fresh out of Jimmy hat's
I'm sayin' "that's I don't go raw"
So baby, hit the door
And when you can't be my lover
'Cause you love me and you want a lot more
Baby, hit the door....

{Chorus #2} 
It's hard being the number 1 player (say what)
Hey, it's hard being the number 1 player (I can dig it)
It's hard being the number 1 player (mack on)
Baby, it's hard being the number 1 player

[Rich Nice]

Face down in a bloodstained carpet
Get chicks at the farmers' market
White girls buy produce

I drink a can of Sparks and try to freestyle
Ex-girlfriend's on speed dial
Oh that's a drunk dial, drunk sexting
Drunk stagger, drunk swagger

I don't rap good, it don't matter
Can't sing good, it don't matter
Cause I'm blacked out sleepwalking
On a quest for God at my friend's apartment

White boy wasted
Glue stick pasted

People killin' people dyin'
Children hurtin', I hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preachin'?
Would you turn the other cheek again?
Mama, mama, mama, tell us what the hell is goin' on
Can't we all just get along?
Father, father, father help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me
Questioning
(Where's the love)

Yo what's going on with the world, momma
(Where's the love)
Yo people living like they ain't got no mommas
(Where's the love)
I think they all distracted by the drama and
Attracted to the trauma, mamma
(Where's the love)
I think they don't understand the concept or
The meaning of karma
(Where's the love)

Overseas, yeah they trying to stop terrorism
(Where's the love)
Over here on the streets the police shoot
The people put the bullets in 'em
(Where's the love)
But if you only got love for your own race
(Where's the love)
Then you're gonna leave space for others to discriminate
(Where's the love)

And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate then you're bound to get irate
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how hate works and operates
Man, we gotta set it straight
Take control of your mind and just meditate
And let your soul just gravitate
To the love, so the whole world celebrate it

People killin' people dyin'
Children hurtin', I hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preachin'?
Would you turn the other cheek again?
Mama, mama, mama, tell us what the hell is goin' on
Can't we all just get along?
Father, Father, Father help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning
(Where's the love)

It just ain't the same, always in change
(Where's the love)
New days are strange, is the world insane?
(Where's the love)
Nation droppin' bombs killing our little ones
(Where's the love)
Ongoing suffering as the youth die young
(Where's the love)

Where's the love when a child gets murdered
Or a cop gets knocked down
Black lives not now
Everybody matter to me
All races, y'all don't like what I'm sayin'? Haterade, tall cases
Everybody hate somebody
Guess we all racist
Black Eyed Peas do a song about love and y'all hate this
All these protests with different colored faces
We was all born with a heart
Why we gotta chase it?
And every time I look around

Every time I look up, every time I look down
No one's on a common ground
(Where's the love)
And if you never speak truth then you never know how love sounds
(Where's the love)
And if you never know love then you never know God, wow
(Where's the love)
Where's the love y'all? I don't, I don't know
Where's the truth y'all? I don't know

People killin' people dyin'
Children hurtin', I hear them cryin'
Could you practice what you preach?
Would you turn the other cheek?
Father, Father, Father help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning
(Where's the love)
(Where's the love)

Love is the key
(Where's the love)
Love is the answer
(Where's the love)
Love is the solution
(Where's the love)
(Where's the love)
They don't want us to love
(Where's the love)
Love is powerful
(Where's the love)
(Where's the love)

My mama asked me why I never vote never vote
'Cause police men want me dead and gone (Dead and gone)
That election looking like a joke (Such a joke)
And the weed man still sellin' dope
Somebody gotta give these niggas hope (Please hope)
All he ever wanted was a smoke (My gosh)
Said he can't breathe with his hands in the air
Layin' on the ground died from a choke
(Where's the love)

I feel the weight of the world on my shoulders
As I'm gettin' older y'all people gets colder
Most of us only care about money makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinemas
What happened to the love and the values of humanity?
(Where's the love)
What happened to the love and the fairness and equality?
(Where's the love)
Instead of spreading love we're spreading animosity
(Where's the love)
Lack of understanding leading us away from unity
(Where's the love)

name: '03 Bonnie & Clyde(Jay-Z):
Look for me, Young, B
Cruisin' down the west-side, highway
Doing what we like to do, our way
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason
All of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl wit' me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel; it's true to the heart
She rides with me--the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during "Sex and the City"
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together--how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov' and B

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride till the very end it's me and my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride till the very end it's me and my boyfriend

The problem is you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
Dat ain't 'bout nothin
If ever you mad about somethin', it won't be that, oh no, it won't be that
I don't be at places where we comfy at
With no be-atch; oh no, you won't see that
And, no, I ain't perfect; nobody walkin' this earth's surface is
But, girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin' at Hermes, Birkin' bag
Manolo Blahnik, Timbs, aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry--only worry is him
She'd do anything necessary for him
And I'd do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yup

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride till the very end it's me and my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride till the very end it's me and my boyfriend

(Talk to 'em, B)
If I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you if somebody hurts you
Even if the somebody was me
(Break it down for 'em, B)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride till the very end it's me and my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride till the very end it's me and my boyfriend

Just the two of us

C'mon hai-hai, we goin' to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama? she's takin a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell (whew!) da-da musta runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinkin', it's kind of late to go swimmin'
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you actin' bashful?
Don't you want to help da-da build a sand castle? (yeah!)
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch, it don't hurt, her was eatin'
Dinner while you were sweepin' and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy isn't she? we'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?

See honey, there's a place called heaven and a place called hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And da-da's probably on his way to all of em except one
'cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother do ya? (nah)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say mama was real real bad
She was bein' mean to dad and made him real real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin' to climb out (wa'!)
I told you it's okay hai hai, want to ba-ba?
Take a night-night? nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make goo-goo ca-ca? da-da change your dia-dee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
Ninety-seven bonnie and clyde, me and my daughter

Just the two of us
Just the two of us
And when we ride!
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Just you and I!
Just the two of us

Wake up sweepy head we're here, before we pway
We're gonna take mama for a whittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin' in her ear (ma-ma!)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you want to help da-da tie a rope around this rock? (yeah!)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of three dummies
One, two, free, wee! (whoosh)
There goes mama, spwashin' in the wa-ta
No more fightin wit dad, no more restraining order
No more step-da-da, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her (mommy!)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk

Just the two of us
Just the two of us
And when we ride!

Before I think about coming to cribs, I be lugging my glitz so big
On the waist it be rubbing my ribs, it's very dangerous fuckin' with this

I been doublin' chips holdin' my own with the chrome double-grips
Up in the mix, caught a couple of vics when I used to fight
But I ain't been scufflin' since this is as tough as it gets
Never leave nothin' with prints or you get blast

I stay stoned, smokin' while I'm on the low, I'm copin'

A cool guy, but at times you catch me Tone-Locin'
Been through a lotta shit, but never had a bone broken
It's tragic how I rap shit with my own potion
From here to Hoboken I was hoppin' trains with no token
Now I'm on stage, they say I'm show-boatin' my flow potent
'Cause it's mixed in raw spell it backwards, it's 'War' the gat spits
You back flip through the door I kill 'em all, Terror Squadian style

name: 'Bout That Time(Large Professor):
It's 'bout that time
Woo, yeah, aha, aha, you know
Yeah, word up

Come on, lights, cameras, action it's on
Straight outta gate with another hot song
Keepin' it real though gonna last long
Break out the stiletto coming mad strong

Bounce if you wanna, lounge will play the corner
I'm New York talking that gangster talk
Twenty-four bases, queue to the oasis
Suspicious see eyes and no faces

Been there, years just put in to work
For the dough, so you know that I couldn't get jerked
Street mental, throw on the hoodie then lurk
In the rental until the end of the earth

I'ma be that fellow with the mozzarella
Always cooking up the new hot seller
Putting that money in the bank like the teller
And this be the number one rank, let me tell you

It's 'bout that time, it's 'bout that time
It's 'bout that time, it's 'bout that time
It's 'bout that time, it's 'bout that time
It's 'bout that time, it's 'bout that time

On the fast track chilling, creeping like a villain
In 2000 new car, new house and
Buy the whole store up, style I'm too pro, son
Get even more buck wild, I draw crowds and

In every state I still draw them at every forum
Don't lose no points I just score them
And count blessings at the top of my freshness
Live, get it right this is not no job

Today or tomorrow it doesn't matter
Got the stages moving on up the ladder
And stay grounded, remember the Bronx 'cause they founded
Cutting them old joints up by James Brown, kid

Golden, 'fore I forget hold it
Got to shout out the block, four-fifth Holden
And Jamaica, Queens I'm true to the fort
Every day, all day not new to the sport

In Elisabeth, kids in Queens is who I feast with
When I ain't in the lab flipping beats with
Drums to pound, I be breaking it down
With homeboy Van on the way uptown, how that sound

It's 'bout that time, it's 'bout that time
It's 'bout that time, it's 'bout that time
It's 'bout that time, it's 'bout that time
It's 'bout that time, it's 'bout that time

There's a whole lot of rappers in the world today
Some good, there is some that got nothing to say
Some fake, some false, some imitation
But I'm the uncut raw for your generation

Work magic with terms like never before
Hang them rappers live, leave their head on the floor
Drop hits for the hip hop crowd that rock kicks and hats
Crisped jeans and whips to match

Hardcore system up on blast
Cock, dip and stash live now and forget the past
In the streets try to hustle while eating a meal
Watching out so you don't get beaten in the grill

'Cause the crossroads is deep, sleep and you will
Be the next one up, I'm feeding the real
So get eardrums son, start heating the drill
One time and this is what y'all feel and I'ma still be


name: 'Till I Collapse(Eminem):
'Cause sometimes you just feel tired, you feel weak
And when you feel weak you feel like you want to just give up

But you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you want to just fall flat on your face and collapse

'Til I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em
'Cause when I am not then I'm a stop pinning them
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts when I'm stop sending them
Women are caught in webs spin and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin is just not real enough
The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling a
Minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're coming with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics that shock, is it a miracle
Or am I just a product of pop fizzing up
For shizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up
You Bizzles forgot Slizzle does not give a f*ck

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Music is like magic there's a certain feeling you get
When you're real and you spit and people are feeling your shit
This is your moment and every single minute you spittin'
Trying to hold onto it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in;
It goes, Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie
Andre from Outkast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it but you know respect you've got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney, Nate hit me

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Soon as a verse starts I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? Enough to not go against me, smart
And its absurd how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers'
So this is like a full blown attack I'm launching at 'em
The track is on some battling raps who want some static
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Until the roof (Until the roof)
The roof comes off (The roof comes off)
Until my legs (Until my legs)
Give out from underneath me (Underneath me, I)

I will not fall
I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me

name: (Everything I Do) I Do It for You(Brandy):
Look into my eyes
You will see, what you mean to me
Search your heart, search your soul
When you find me then, you'll search no more

Don't tell me its not worth trying for
You cant tell me its not worth dying for
You know its true, everything I do, I do it for you

Look into your heart, you will find
There is nothing there to hide
Take me as I am, take my life
I would give it all, I would sacrifice

Don't tell me its not worth fighting for
I cant help it, there's nothing I want more
You know its true, everything I do, I do it for you

There is no love, like your love
And no other, could give me more love
There's nowhere, unless you're there
All the time, all the way

You cant tell me its not worth trying for
Just cant help it, there's nothing in the world I want more
I would fight for you, yeah I'd lie for you
Walk the wire for you, yeah I'd die for you

You know its true
Everything I do, I do it for you

name: (How Could You) Bring Him Home(Eamon):
I got the first flight out when I finished up the tour, because I missed you
I even flew home a day too soon, all because I couldn't wait to kiss you
"Oh, how she will be loved"
Was the one thing stuck in my mind
And how tonight would be
Remembered for the rest of your life

I never thought that I'd do something like that
When I saw you two, it hit me like a heart attack
Oh no
How could you let somebody in through our door?
How could you bring him home?

I never thought I'd lose my temper like that
Now it's a fucked-up situation; he ain't coming back
Oh no
How could you please another man on our floor?
How could you bring him home?

I know you know I passed on every girl because I thought I really loved you
And you know that I'd never put anyone or anything above you
Because I loved you
And it was that love (It was that love)
That made me lose my head, and now it's too late
One day too soon
You'll regret it for the rest of your days

I never thought that I'd do something like that
When I saw you two, it hit me like a heart attack
Oh no
How could you let somebody in through our door?
How could you bring him home?

I never thought I'd lose my temper like that
Now it's a fucked-up situation; he ain't coming back
Oh no
How could you please another man on our floor?
How could you bring him home?

Hey
Oh
Hey
Oh

Please, God, forgive
Me for what I did
This day will stay for as long as I live
But if you walked in
And seen what I seen
I know any man would have done just the same

Please, God, forgive (No)
Me for what I did (No)
This day will stay for as long as I live
But if you walked in (No)

name: (Rock) Superstar(Cypress Hill):
[B-Real talking]
A lot of a, sharks out there, try'na take a bite of somethin'
What's hot
Lot of chameleons out there, try'na change up
Anytime somethin' new comes along, everybody wants a bite
Don't happen overnight

[Chorus]
So you want to be a rock superstar? 
And live large 
A big house. Five cars, You're in charge. 
Comin' up in the world. 
Don't trust nobody got to look over your shoulder constantly

I remember the days when I was a young kid growing up
Looking in the mirror, dreaming about blowin' up 
The rock crowds. Make money. Chill with the honeys. 
Sign autographs and whatever the people want from me.
Shit's funny how impossible dreams manifest 
And the games that be comin' with it 
Nevertheless, you got to go for the gusto 
But you don't know about the blood, sweat, and tears and 
Losin' some of your peers.

And losin' some of yourself to the years past, gone by 
Hopefully it don't manifest for the wrong guy 
Egomaniac and the brainiac don't know how to act 
Shit's deep 
48 track studio gangsta mack sign the deal 
Think he's gonna make a mil but never will 
'Til he crosses over, still 
Fillin' your head with fantasies 
Come with me 
Show the sacrifice it takes to make the G's 

You want to be a rock superstar in the biz 
And take shit from people who don't know what it is 
I wish it was all fun and games 
But the price of fame is high 
And some can't pay the way 
Feel trapped in
What you rappin' about? 
Tell me what happened when you lost clout? 
The route you took started collapsing 
No fans. No fame. No respect. No change. No women and
Everybody shits on your name. 

[Chorus: x2]

People see rock stars, you know what I'm sayin'? But you still try to get out 
More like everybody else, you know, its a fun job, but its still a job. There's 
Gonna be another cat comin' out,
Looking like me, sounding like me next year. I know this. It'll be a flipside 
Tell what you did someone trying to spin off like some circus.

You ever have big dreams? Or makin' big cream? 
Big shot, heavy hitter on the mainstream 
You want to look trendy in the Bentley 
Be a star band, never act friendly. 
You want to have big fame 
Let me explain what happens to these stars and their big brains 
First they get played like all damn day 
Long as you sell everything will be ok 
Then you get dissed by the media and fans 
Things never stay the same way they began 
I heard that some never get fooled to the fullest 
That's why fools end up dining on a bullet 
Think everything's fine in the big time 
See me in my Lex with the chrome ray shine 
So you roll far and live large 
It ain't all that goes with being a rock star

[Chorus: x2]

My own son don't know me 
I'm chillin' in a hotel room, lonely 
But I thank God I'm with my homies 
But sometimes I wish I was back home 
But only no radio or video's gonna show me no love 
They're phony 
Got to hit the road solely so the record gets pushed by Sony 
I'm in the middle like Monie 
And the press say that my own people disown me 
The best way back to keep your head straight 
Never inflate the cranium 
They're too worried about them honeys at the Palladium 
Who just want to cling on, swing on, and so on 
Go on fall off - the ho's fall off 
To the next rock superstar with no shame 
Give him a year and they'll be right out the game 
The same as the last one who came before him 
Gained fame started getting' ignored 
I warned him 
Asured him this ain't easy 
Take it from the weazy 
Sleazy people want to be so cheesy 
They're fucking evil 
Assassins, assassins

[Chorus: x2]

If gettin money is a crime, then I confess
Ain't about money? I could care less
When you see us comin know it's time to collect
Niggaz be like, "Here come the IRS!"
Kick down doors, shoot through walls
Queen Bee's a movement, fight for the cause
Got a bite that's bigger than "Jaws"
With or without my boys, I still make noise

New York - when Kim say, "Can you hear me now?"
That's when y'all turn it up
Midwest - when Kim say, "Can you hear me now?"
That's when y'all burn it up
L.A. - when Kim say, "Can you hear me now?"
Y'all make them cars jump
Dirty South - when Kim say, "Can you hear me now?"
That's when y'all get it crunk!

My last album, some of y'all wasn't ready for it
Alright, I slow it up, put the brakes on for ya
I know what I'm doin, I ain't losin my mind
I'm just so advanced I'm ahead of my time
You all stuck at the back, I'm ahead of the line
Even in the dark, I'm still gon' shine
You'll see what I mean in 2009
I kick outer space raps - ILL RHYMES
Live guitars, nigga f*ck cars
I'm tryin to buy a spaceship to get to Mars
Look out the window, and reach for the stars
It's a new day, Lil' Kim's in charge
Got a big dick, I'll bone you out
Like money in the bank, loan you out
If you ain't straight I'll comb you out
Lil' Kim and Scott Storch be zonin out!

You actin like y'all real tough act to follow
I got medallions the size of a half a dollar
And about to buy my best friend a beauty parlor
I know y'all don't wanna see Kim on top
Please stop worryin about what I got
What the f*ck y'all know about the Yonker Rock
When I'm cookin, keep your hands out my pot
Them boys ain't bad and ain't no bitch greater
Stop tryin to use me as a respirator
I'm the same bitch on the escalator
And I still ain't got no time for you fuckin haters
I might start my day at Piarage'
Or with a Mafia meetin at the Brooklyn Cafe
"Okay, y'all wanna play?"
Like 9/11, you gon' remember this day

name: (You're My One and Only) True Love(Seduction):
When you came into my life
You showed me what true love was meant to be
You brought light into my shadows
And made me be your number one priority
And when you hold me in your arms
The rest of the world seems to disappear
I'm in heaven when I'm with you
And for the first time I can tell it's real

You're my one and only, my one and only true love, true love

Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh

So many times before
I thought that I had really found true love
But all I really found
Was someone who would abuse my love
Seduction, surrender, to a feeling
That is oh so new
My heart is on fire, so I'm giving
All my love to you

Ooh

You're my one and only
My one and only true love
True Love

Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh

Were two great tastes that taste great together
Well be around forever & ever
A symbol of love thatll last through time
A river in France, a statue in the Guggenheim
Tight like a punch a Mike Tyson blow
I'm in love-Youre my one and only

It's you and only you
Just you that I want to share my life with
No one in this world
Can bring me all the joy
All the joy you bring
You're my one and only
My one and only true love
True love
Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh

We teach girls to shrink themselves
To make themselves smaller
We say to girls
"You can have ambition
But not too much
You should aim to be successful
But not too successful
Otherwise you will threaten the man"
Because I am female
I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices
Always keeping in mind that
Marriage is the most important
Now marriage can be a source of
Joy and love and mutual support
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage
And we don't teach boys the same?
We raise girls to each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments
Which I think can be a good thing
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings
In the way that boys are
Feminist: the person who believes in the social
Political, and economic equality of the sexes

You wake up, flawless
Post up, flawless
Ride round in it, flawless
Flossin on that, flawless

My Daddy taught me how to love my haters
My sister taught me I should speak my mind
My man made me feel so God damn fine

name: ---- tha Police(N.W.A):
Right about now, N.W.A. court is in full effect
Judge Dre presiding
In the case of N.W.A. vs. the Police Department
Prosecuting attorneys are: MC Ren, Ice Cube, 
And Eazy motherfuckin E

Order, order, order
Ice Cube, take the motherfuckin stand
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
And nothin but the truth so help your black ass?

You god damn right!

Well won't you tell everybody what the f*ck you gotta say?

F*ck the police comin' straight from the underground
A young nigga got it bad cause I'm brown
And not the other color so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
F*ck that shit, cause I ain't the one
For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
To be beatin' on, and thrown in jail
We can go toe to toe in the middle of a cell
Fuckin' with me cause I'm a teenager
With a little bit of gold and a pager
Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product
Thinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics
You'd rather see, me in the pen
Than me and Lorenzo rollin' in a Benz-o
Beat a police out of shape
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still gettin' swoll off bread and water
I don't know if they fags or what
Search a nigga down, and grabbin' his nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top
Black police showin' out for the white cop
Ice Cube will swarm
On ANY motherfucker in a blue uniform
Just cause I'm from, the CPT
Punk police are afraid of me!
HUH, a young nigga on the warpath
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops, dyin' in L.A.
Yo Dre, I got somethin' to say

[Chorus]
F*ck the police
F*ck the police
F*ck the police
F*ck the Police

Pull your god damn ass over right now
Aww shit, now what the f*ck you pullin' me over for?
'Cause I feel like it!
Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the f*ck up
Man, f*ck this shit
Aight smart ass, I'm takin' your black ass to jail!

MC Ren, will you please give your testimony 
To the jury about this fucked up incident?

F*ck the police and Ren said it with authority
Because the niggas on the street is a majority
A gang, is with whoever I'm steppin'
And the motherfuckin' weapon is kept in 
A stash box, for the so-called law
Wishin' Ren was a nigga that they never saw
Lights start flashin' behind me
But they're scared of a nigga so they mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh
Because it gives em a hint, not to step in my path
For police, I'm sayin, "F*ck you punk!"
Readin' my rights and shit, it's all junk
Pullin' out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake-assed badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so you can see what's up
And we'll go at it punk, and I'm a f*ck you up!
Make you think I'm a kick your ass
But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast
I'm sneaky as f*ck when it comes to crime
But I'm a smoke 'em now and not next time
Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me
Or any asshole, that threatens me
I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
Takin' out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
The motherfuckin' villain that's mad
With potential, to get bad as f*ck
So I'm a turn it around
Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound
Yeah, somethin' like that
But it all depends on the size of the gat
Takin' out a police, would make my day
But a nigga like Ren don't give a f*ck to say
 
[Chorus]

Yeah man, what you need?
Police, open now
Aww shit
We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest
Get down and put your hands up where I can see 'em
(Move motherfucker, move now!)
What the f*ck did I do, man what did I do?
Just shut the f*ck up
And get your motherfuckin' ass on the floor
(You heard the man, shut the f*ck up!)
But I didn't do shit
Man just shut the f*ck up!

Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand
And tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?

I'm tired of the motherfuckin jackin
Sweatin my gang, while I'm chillin in the shack, and
Shinin the light in my face, and for what?
Maybe it's because I kick so much butt
I kick ass, or maybe cause I blast
On a stupid-assed nigga when I'm playin with the trigger
Of any Uzi or an AK
Cause the police always got somethin stupid to say
They put out my picture with silence
Cause my identity by itself causes violence
The E with the criminal behavior
Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge, what do ya got?
A sucker in a uniform waitin to get shot
By me, or another nigga
And with a gat it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger
(Size ain't shit, he's from the old school fool)
And as you all know, E's here to rule
Whenever I'm rollin, keep lookin in the mirror
And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a
Dumb motherfucker with a gun
And if I'm rollin off the 8, he'll be the one
That I take out, and then get away
While I'm drivin off laughin this is what I'll say
 
[Chorus]

The verdict
The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck, 
White bread, chicken shit motherfucker
But wait, that's a lie!  That's a god damn lie!
Get him out of here!
I want justice!
Get him the f*ck out my face!
I want justice!
Out, right now!
F*ck you, you black mother fuckers!
 
[Chorus]

name: ...In the Dog House(Dog Eat Dog):
You don't have to be the person actin' like the fool
About time you learned you somethin', so go to school
You never knew you had the answer but that's a lie
Livin' by your intuition and that ain't right 
Face first
In the doghouse
Face first 

Would not could not should not, but you did
Don't even try to cross me you snot nosed kid
This fight ain't half way over, you soft skin clown
That ill pill you're selling just won't wash down 
I see what you do to others, and what you've done
I can't help but think and wonder when my time will come
So when you go for yours, you better knock me out
You come back to my neighborhood and I'll bust your crown

And you're bout to roll that shit up

Well pop this cd in right here and take a hit of me

My album is so addictive {*echoes}

Was Showbiz interessant macht

Wie sich Leute plötzlich ändern, 
Wie zum Beispiel die phantasielosesten Wesen

So erfahr' ich Sachen über mich

Hab gehört, ich rasier meine Beine und Brusthaare.
Hab gehört, ich hätte Crewnamen plus Initialen
In Gothic-Lettern tätowiert auf meinen Genitalien.
Hab gehört, ich sei nicht HipHop,

Hab gehört, dass ich nix anderes als dissen kann.
Hab gehört, ich stifte die Jungend zum Kiffen an.
Hab gehört, ich hätte die Allüren eines Superstars.
Hab gehört, ich hätte Beef mit Kool Savas.

Achja: angeblich hab' ich sogar Beef mit ganz Berlin. [Ui! ]
Ich hab gehört, dass ich in Liedern immer nur dasselbe sage,
Hab gehört, dass ich tagsüber nackt in der Elbe bade.
Hab gehört, ich rap' nicht mehr, hätt' nur aufs Geld gewartet.
Viele meinen sogar, dass ich zu oft dasselbe sage.
Hab gehört, ich wurd auf der Straße gesehen,
Beim Schlafen Im Gehen, [Gähnen]
Weil ich aus Langeweile anfing, Schafe zu zählen.
Ich hab gehört, man soll nicht alles glauben, was Leute erzählen
Denn die Meisten labern zu viel Scheiße.

Ich hab' gehört, ich sei frustriert
Und dass meine Frau mich verlassen hat.
Wer ist dann die Frau, die letzte Nacht in meinem Bett geschlafen hat?
Ich hab gehört, ich hätte ausgesorgt und sei schon reich.
Wenn das so ist, dann wieso sagt mir meine Bank nicht Bescheid?

Ich hab gehört, dass ich eigentlich Sachse wär
Und nur nach Hamburg gezogen, weils gerade so abgeht hier.

Hab alles gehört, vom größten Kompliment zum schlimmsten Diss,
Von der höchsten Prominenz bis zu den jüngsten Kids.
Wurd verglichen mit allen möglichen Rappern der Szene,
Hab gehört, ich sei cooler als diese und besser als jene
Aber nicht so DEEP wie er und nicht so tight wie ER -
Erzählt das jemand anders, ich will diesen Scheiß nicht hör'n.
Ich finde mich selbst am besten, da kann kommen, wer will,
Deren Promoplatten landen in meinem Sondermüll.
Also, hört bitte auf, die und mich zu vergleichen,

Ich hab gehört, man soll nicht alles glauben, was man hört
Denn die Meisten reden zu viel Scheiße.

Ich hab' gehört, ich sei frustriert
Und dass meine Frau mich verlassen hat.
Wer ist dann die Frau, die letzte Nacht in meinem Bett geschlafen hat?
Ich hab gehört, ich hätte ausgesorgt und sei schon reich.
Wenn das so ist, dann wieso sagt mir meine Bank nicht Bescheid?

Ich hab' gehört, ich sei frustriert
Und dass meine Frau mich verlassen hat.
Wer ist dann die Frau, die letzte Nacht in meinem Bett geschlafen hat?

Ich hörte, ich sei nicht mehr down mit Dynamite und Tropf.
Wenn das so ist, dann woher kommen dann die Beats aus Deiner Box?

name: 0 To 100/The Catch Up(Drake):
F*ck bein' on some chill shit
We go 0 to 100 nigga, real quick
They be on that rap to pay the bill shit
And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga
Niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up
The 6 ain't friendly but it's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce, chef, curry with the pot, boy
360 with the wrist, boy
Who the f*ck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man we really with the shits, boy
Really with the shits
I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy cause I got all the hits, boy
F*ck all that "Drake you gotta chill" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
F*ck all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit
Yeah, I'm on some Raptors pay my bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to money mart to make the pickups
Man it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billi's, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOAT's for it
Ugh, I run this shit, they like "Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest"
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this

The other night, Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how I feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if it wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems, askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, f*ck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real

name: 03' Bonnie & Clyde(Jay-Z):
Uhh uhh uhh
You ready B? Let's go get 'em

Look for me, Young B
Cruisin' down the westside highway
Doing what we like to do our way
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason
All of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel
It's true to the heart

She rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during 'Sex and the City'
She gets Carrie fever but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
What ever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track mami is keepin me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov' and B

All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down the ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
(Me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down the ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
(Me and my boyfriend)

The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
Now they 'bout nothin' if ever you mad about somethin'
It won't be that, oh no, it won't be that
I don't be at places where we comfy at
With no be-atch, oh no, you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect, nobody walkin' this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid

I keep you workin' at Hermes, Birkin bag
Manolo Blahnik, Timbs, aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep

All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down the ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
(Me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down the ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
(Me and my boyfriend)

Talk to 'em B, if I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if it's somebody was me
Yeah, break it down for 'em
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could've been
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us

And I promise I'll give my life
All of my trust if you was my boyfriend
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
All of my trust if you was my boyfriend

All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down the ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
(Me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down the ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
(Me and my boyfriend)

Check it

One day, I was tryin to be myself
The same day this thug say, "You gotta come hard!"
Nigga, times is hard, I'm tryin hard to make it
It ain't hard to tell, it's hard for me to fake it
Plus, it's hard to be me, it's hard to stop drinkin
I guess it's hard for you hard niggas to start thinkin
Pussy MC's stinkin so I can't get hard
Some, become MC's cause it's hard to get a job
Hard for you to trust people, you don't trust in God
Even harder to be the Gods we created to be
This Western way of life ain't native to me
Put one nigga in your Pulp Fiction and relate it to me?
I hate it that we, the only race that call our women hoes
Niggas, be too hard to say "ho" at the shows
I rose... like a florist to bring the flavor like a Taurus
Might not have the murderous verse, but I stay hard to the chorus
Took this girl to work, she say I ain't have a real job
Like that dick you had last night, baby, I work real hard
Simple motherfuckers tellin me hard is criminal
Niggas you thought was hard, you pourin out your liquor for
Years ago, I thought I was hard, in high school fightin
Now, I'm the hardest man working in show business
Handle your business or shut the f*ck up

(Dug Infinite) It's just one two many niggas got cars and no land

Forever, I ain't gon' be rappin
Shit'll happen to me, I gotta let niggas know
This mark asked me do I know his cousin Jimbo
Nigga, I don't even know myself
You want me to get you in
Jack, I'm trying to get through the do' myself
Opportunity knocked, but he ain't call 'fore he came
Yeah, I got a name, but only twenty dollars to it
Next album you gon' blow, up my ass, you done blew it before
Being in my video, what's that gonna do for your life?
Get you some pussy? You should be gettin rump off GP
Quit that you look like you say I seen you on TV
I be readin niggas but readin be makin me sleepy (Hey!)
So strong am I, A Hundred Styles and Runnin
Niggas stuck on one and them I ran by
Claimin they fly but they stand-by
I come truer than a dream, and youse a damn lie
With that anti-rap, complainin about this and about that
Sounding bitch like, that ain't gonna make a nigga get right
I'm number one

Cuz if I ran home and didn't fight back my mom'd beat that tail

And uh, no more beef and pork just muslim books and fish fork

Huh, thinkin back, you gotta watch your back and play it well
Enjoyed myself when I was out there tryin ta get in that mail
We used to kick it at the waterfront the whole Vallejo
Watchin the pervin contestses between E-40 and Del
That's what we did up under the bridge fools posted up
Choppin game conversatin gettin toast up
Leanin against my seamless convertible tops and boosted cleaners
Them Click boys mobbin deep in cuts, actin meanest
The good times, they gone, here in the can is my new phone
Guess in order to do some right I had to do some wrong
Picked up a package yesterday and I was HAPPY
It was a box and full of goodies from my PAPPY
Tripped me out ain't seen or heard from Poppa Duke in years
Sent me a picture and some fetti dang they sheadin tears
See first you born then you live then you die
One day soon I'll get another try, one love

Niggas we be digital, subliminal, come in
From the 5 star general
Attack you from the blind side, invisible
To the naked eye

Better have your 8 essential vitamins and minerals
The wu is coming through you know the outcome
Critical
Condition in your physical for injurin
The officer and gentleman who stack by the benjamen

Off a beat like this
I keep a night stick
In case any stick up care where heat might miss
I chicken fry rice bitch
In a white trench
Bustin off two macks I'm like "I'm hit"!!!
I'm just playin, I clear the croud out
Like a peppa can sprayin

Go guard your pray

From deputant down to stripper

A drink mixed with four kinds of liquors
Catch me at the bar "Fu Bar"
Ladies know who we are and
Dream of fuckin a star
Who da scrub
Shotgun in this man car
Burnin up
Forever gettin thrown out the club
It be us Paul
Shot out and bugged
I smoke bud, sniff a bee's ass to get a buzz
I'm everything you think you don't know

I throw a 5 in the power
Poppa wheely with the front end hittin speed bumps, 40 miles per hour
I'm out at Howard, next to Baltimore
Takin change out the fountains at shoppin malls
Rats can only afford Chuck E Cheese
The blood in my jeans is tough like Buddy Lee
Semi-dart auto off ya, blood coughin
Meth pull the last spark plug with a heart pump

New jacks studderin, that the man from the upperhand
Punch, atomic bomb I hit many
From Bricks to South Park you dyin with Kenny
While you bailin I'm trailin
Rockin hard hat helmets clip the satellite servallence
When I walk by you better not be kickin
Or i put two more in that terriyaki chicken

You've just been fitted for them seeman shoes
This is bottom of the lake raps
Stab you in the back
Kung Fu
52 cops can't withstand the 52 blocks
Unless they bust like 52 shots
I'm the has been that have not
Battle kids at Maxwell's house
Know when I'm good to the last drop
what's my name Meth he's name Doc
Just like urban
See me in the gran transportation splurgin
Drivin with a turban who push a black suburban (come on)
We rollin windows half down through the urban
Network law lay it down like a persian
M to the E to the F, spell curtain

Get out your car sucker
This ain't yours
Robbed you with a gun that filled with paint balls
And brauds got the nerve to act funny
You a champaine ho, with cool aide money
Frown bitch, Doc up in that town quick
You back down a point on NFL blitz
I'm lyin buddah break fool and take two
And put your hole in the earth to escape through

We say
Wa wa wa wa 1 2 1 2
Wa wa wa wa 1 2 1 2
We say
Wa wa wa wa 1 2 1 2 we say
Wa wa wa wa 1 2 1 2
We say
Wa wa wa wa 1 2 1 2
Wa wa wa wa 1 2 1 2
And if you say f*ck me
I'm a say f*ck you
Wa wa wa wa 1 2 1 2
