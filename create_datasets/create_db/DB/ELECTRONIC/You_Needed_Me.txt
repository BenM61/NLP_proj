I cried a tear 
Oh I did try 
I was confused 
You cleared my mind 

I sold my soul 
You bought it back for me 
And held the earth 
You gave me dignity 

Somehow you needed me 
You gave me strength 
To stand alone again 
To face the world 

Out on my own again 
You put me high 
Upon a pedestal 
So high that I could almost see eternity 

You needed me 
You needed me 

I can't believe it's you 
I can't believe it's you 
I needed you 
And you were there 

And I'll never leave, why should I leave? 
I needed you 
I finally found someone who really cares 

(You needed me) 

You held my hand 
It was cold 
And I was lost 
You took me home 

You gave me love 
That I was at the end 
I turned my life 
Back into truth again You even called me 'friend' 

You gave me strength 
To stand alone again 
To face the world 
Out on my own again 

You put me high 
Upon a pedestal 
So high that I could almost see eternity 
You needed me 
You needed me 

You needed me 
You needed me 
Oh, yes, you needed me 
You needed me
