You've got fashion and style
I'm lovin' your smile and
The way you get down
I can't see no one else
It's you by yourself, yea
In spite of the crowd
(Baby no one else matters)

[Bridge]
It started off with a kiss (uh huh)
Never expectin' this (uh huh)
And now I'm here copin' with
My addiction (addiction)
It started off with a kiss (uh huh)
Never expectin' this (uh huh)
And now I'm here copin' with
My addiction

While all the girls say

[Chorus]
I'm addicted to you
I'm addicted to you
I'm addicted to you
You're my addiction
I'm addicted to you
I'm addicted to you
I'm addicted to you
You're my addiction

When I'm lookin' in the mirror
Honey, you are all I see
And it could not be no clearer
That I need you here with me

I was hopin you'd notice
The way that I like to
Have you around
Listen and you will find that
Your heart beats for me
Girl, I hear the soun

[Bridge]

While all the girls say

[Chorus]

Hey lemme find out I got you Amy wined out
I get em hooked like I threw a fishing line out
My white girl keep me Federlined out
Im to G so I stay Gucci signed out (gucci)
And I get so much attention
They sit and talk about me like intervention
They say that white phantom look so cocaine
I hop out the suicides lookin' so Kobain
And I just Courtney Love when they know your name
They like loso we already know so damn
They come back one more grams
Right back like Lindsay out the program

When I'm lookin' in the mirror
Honey, you are all I see
And it could not be no clearer
That I need you here with me

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

I'm addicted to you [Repeat: x3]
You're my addiction
