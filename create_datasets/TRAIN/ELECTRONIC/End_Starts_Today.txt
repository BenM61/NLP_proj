Not really sure what I am looking for
A destiny that leaves you wanting so much more
I need to stop putting it before me
I'm straying but I know I've not lost it
Transparent but I know what I am (so near)
So why don't I listen to what you're saying to me

Convenient but I have no function
It's just routine but there is no corruption
Nail me down, I know my head's not here
Bring it back, the end's starting today
Will you leave this party with me
We were not invited anyway
I have a path but I can't keep to it (no way)

I followed it and don't know where it took me (nowhere)
I don't talk back or even question
The odd one out but kept my involvement
Nail me down, I know my head's not here

Bring it back, the end's starting today
Will you leave this party with me
We were not invited anyway
(Nail me down)
(Nowhere)
(Nowhere)
