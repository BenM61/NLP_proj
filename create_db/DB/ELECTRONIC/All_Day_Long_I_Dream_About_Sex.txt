So you want to be a rock star
Keep it going, don't stop
Work it while you're on top, call the cops

Roller coaster riding, baby
Up and down
I love to watch you do it

I just want to get close to you
Find out what it takes to move you

Feel the rhythm, hit the spot, getting hot
All night long

All day long I dream about sex
And all night long I think about sex
And all the time I think about sex with you, with you
All day long I dream about sex
And all night long I think about sex
And all the time I think about sex with you, with you

Keep in mind, I'm a love machine
Get it twenty four seven, call me any time you need

Some extra attention, did I forget to mention
School's back in session, get ready for a lesson

I just want to feel alive
And do what it takes to satisfy you

Hour after hour baby
All night long with you

[Repeats]
All day long I dream about sex
And all night long I think about sex
And all the time I think about sex with you, with you
All day long I dream about sex
And all night long I think about sex
And all the time I think about sex with you, with you
