I'd give the World to start all over
Back in the old routine
To live my life in fields of clover
Back in the old routine
Give me my old straw hat and a-double-truckin'
Down the avenue we'll go
Folks passin' by us will stop and eye us
Soon there'll be more, all callin' "Encore"
We'll walk in a wonderful glow, Mister 'O'

Gee, The joy to be there floggin'
(Take your best shot, Son)
Back in the old routine
You're up, you're down, you're in there sluggin'
And you're makin' good)
Back in the old routine
Oh, give me the jazz, the razzamatazz
And we'll tread on Heaven's scene
Back in the old routine

I'd give the World to start all over
(No more blue songs)
Back in the old routine
To live my life in fields of clover
(Too-rah-loo-rah-loo songs)
Back in the old routine
Give me my old straw hat and a-double-truckin'
Down the avenue we'll go
(Man, you're flyin')
Folks passin' by us
(I'm lyin', I'm dyin')
Will stop and eye us
And soon there'll be more, all callin' "Encore"
We'll walk in a wonderful glow
(Oh-ho)

Oh gee, the joy to be there floggin'
(Heaven's near us)
Back in the old routine
You're up, you're down
(Hear them cheer us)
You're in there sluggin'

Back in the old routine
Oh, give me the jazz, the razzamatazz
And we'll tread on Heaven's scene
Back in the old routine

Oh, give me the jazz, the razzamatazz
And we'll tread on Heaven's scene
Back in the old routine
Back where the corn is green
Back in the old routine
