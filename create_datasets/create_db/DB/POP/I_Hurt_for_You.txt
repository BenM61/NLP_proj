You know it kills me to see you crying, to think of all your love
He's been denyin' and I can't blame you for feeling cheated
Being so in love and so unneeded
But, the reason you keep trying is a feelin' that I know

Oh, I hurt for you every time, he breaks your heart
Baby, I hurt for you and it's tearing me apart
To care the way I do, baby I'm a fool
I watch you long for him and I hurt for you

So love won't work out the way you planned it
Darling, all to well I understand it but I'll be right here to console you
If that's the only chance I'll have to hold you
'Cause you're so lonely being stranded with a dream you can't let go

Oh, I hurt for you every time he breaks your heart
Baby, I hurt for you and it's tearing me apart
To care the way I do, baby, I'm a fool
I watch you long for him and I hurt for you

Oh, if you could want the one who loves you
Oh, maybe you would want me now if you could just see how

I hurt for you every time he breaks your heart
Baby, I hurt for you and it's tearing me apart
To care the way I do, baby, I'm a fool
I watch you long for him and I hurt for you
I know you long for him, but I hurt for you
