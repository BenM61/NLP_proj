Iron flowers
And water towers
And lonesome stretches of black

Drunken cowboys
And AM white noise
And Tucson running down my back

This highway runs longer and faster than I do
It rolls on for always dipping in and out of view
The clay turns to asphault and the dark sky turns to blue
This highways runs away from you

Truck stop phone calls
And knuckles
And phony brick walls
And cornfields growing up too fast

Orphan tires
And chapel spires
And other things I thought were gonna last
