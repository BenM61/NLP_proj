I savor every minute that you're here
That you're here with me
Close my eyes and remember every breath
Every memory

Through all these sleepless nights alone
I still feel you
Across these miles away from home
That I never get used to

Every time you go, you take a part of me
A part of me with you
Every time you go
I feel it in my soul
Every, every
Every time you go, half what I used to be
You were in my arms
Every time you go
You take a part of me, a part of me with you
Every time you go

I count the days until you're back again
Back here by my side
When we're apart it feels like, something in me
Something in me dies

I hear your voice over the phone
And God I miss you
Still all these miles away from home
That I never get used to

Every time you go, you take a part of me
A part of me with you
Every time you go
I feel it in my soul
Every, every
Every time you go, half what I used to be
When you were in my arms
Every time you go
You take a part of me, a part of me with you

Oh I'm there with you in your heart
No matter how far apart we are
You're with me, everywhere you go

Every time you go, you take a part of me
A part of me with you
Every time you go
I feel it in my soul

Every time you go, you take a part of me
A part of me with you
Every time you go
I feel it in my soul

Every, every
Every time you go, half what I used to be
When you were in my arms
Every time you go
You take a part of me, a part of me with you
Every time you go
