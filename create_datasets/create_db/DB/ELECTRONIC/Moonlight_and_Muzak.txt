in the teeny weeny world getting smaller all the time
you're the kind of girl i'd like to wine and dine
things go better with a subtle harmony
it's the international motel fantasy

are you the girl i wanted to be
collaborating on the balcony?

moonlight and muzak tonight

we danced all night and i lost all sense of time
to another damn tune i can't get out of my mind
she is a cold war baby from behind the iron curtain
i think we made contact but i can't be certain

am i the man you wanted to be 
operating this strategy?

moonlight and muzak tonight

i'm sentimental but don't betray me
with all that incidental music you play me

moonlight and muzak tonight
