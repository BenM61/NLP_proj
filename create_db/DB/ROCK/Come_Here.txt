There's wind that blows in from the north
And it says that loving takes this course
Come here 
Come here

No I'm not impossible to touch 
I have never wanted you so much
Come here 
Come here

Have I never laid down by your side
Baby, let's forget about this pride
Come here 
Come here

Well I'm in no hurry 
You don't have to run away this time
I know you're timid
But it's gonna be all right this time

There's wind that blows in from the north
And it says that loving takes this course
Come here 
Come here

Please, hey, hey 
Hey, hey
