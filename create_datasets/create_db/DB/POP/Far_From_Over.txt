Well this life's stretched out before me
The highway shimmering with stars
The knowing glances of the runaways
That never made it this far

I can't believe she said that we can work it out
I thought that we were near the end
Gone are the days
All the trouble and the doubt
This is far from over my friend

My lover's name is music
Well she's held my heart so long
Tethered and pulling at the chains of disregard
What if all of this is wrong

I can't believe she said that we can work it out
I thought that we were near the end
Gone are the days
All the trouble and the doubt
This is far from over my friend

And we throw our prayers up skyward
Hoping anyone will hear
From Storyville to Broadway
This soul won't disappear

Well I heard that boy in Memphis
Playing memories and dreams
The ghosts of miracles played upon the stage
And then vanishing like steam

I can't believe she said that we can work it out
I thought that we were near the end
Gone are the days
All the trouble and the doubt
This is far from over my friend
