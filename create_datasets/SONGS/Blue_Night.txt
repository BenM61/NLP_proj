Lately you have been asking me
If all my words are true
Don't you know I'll do anything for you

Sometimes I haven't been good to you
Sometimes I've made you cry
And I am sorry for everything

But I promise you girl
I promise you this

When the blue night is over my face
On the dark side of the world in space
When I'm all alone with the stars above
You are the one I love

So there's no need to worry girl
My heart is sealed for you
And no one's gonna take it away

Cos' I promise you girl
I promise you this

When the blue night is over my face
On the dark side of the world in space
When I'm all alone with the stars above
You are the one I love

Your voice is calling to me in my dreams
My love is stronger than it's ever been
