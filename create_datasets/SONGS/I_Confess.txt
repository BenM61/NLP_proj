I've been really really bad 
I said mean things just to get you mad 
I've been really really glad 
To see you fight for me 
I've been carrying around 
An awful lot of weight that holds me down 
I've got a heavy, heavy heart 
That's making me too crazy 

I might explode or melt down from distress 
I'll never know 'til it gets off my chest 

I confess to loving you too much 
Dying for your touch 
That never is enough to hold me 
Driving way too fast 
Living in the past 
And never knowing that I'm happy 

I've been really, really bad 
I keep shutting down when you get sad 
I don't really understand how to give to you 
I've been known to jump the gun 
I'm the first to leave if it's not fun 
My heart is always on the run 
As soon as I'm confused 

It can't be good to make life the enemy 
If I could I'd tame what's inside me 

I confess I give you little tests 
I do not do my best 
Forgetting that I'm blessed and lucky 
Wasting too much time 
Pouring too much wine 
And tuning out sometimes when you f*ck me 
Being self obsessed 
Too long getting dressed 
Take your tenderness for granted 
Getting negative 
I'm hyper-sensitive 
I come down on you heavy handed 

They say that all things heal faster with the truth 
And confession is the way a soul finds its groove 

Oh I know I gotta confess to 
Loving you too much 
Dying for your touch 
That never is enough to hold me 
Driving way too fast 
Living in the past 
And never knowing that I'm happy 
I give you little tests 
I do not do my best 
Forgetting that I'm blessed and lucky 
Wasting too much time 
Pouring too much wine 
And tuning out sometimes when you f*ck me 

But I do love you
