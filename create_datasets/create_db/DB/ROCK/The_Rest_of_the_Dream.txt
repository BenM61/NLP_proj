You were a tiny spark
Caught in your parents' eyes
When they made love in the dark
You were the big surprise
And the old man came through
Gave his very best for you
And your mother's arms
They kept you warm
Like no other arms could do

When you couldn't find the light
At the top of the stairs
When you cried in the night
Well, you knew they were there
Will the light of the day
Was as bright as it seemed
And you knew in your heart
You were livin' the rest of the dream

Well, I had a dream of you
But I never realized
Baby, the dream was true
That's when you opened my eyes

And I will come through
Do my very best for you
And your lovin' arms
Gonna keep me warm
Like no other arms will do

When you couldn't find the light
At the top of the stairs
When you cried in the night
Well, you knew they were there
Will the light of the day
Was as bright as it seemed
And you knew in your heart
You were livin' the rest of the dream

Now I see a tiny spark
Caught in your lovin' eyes
As we make love in the dark
And wait for the big surprise

And the old man will come through
Son or daughter, just for you
And your mama's arms
Gonna keep you warm
Like no other arms can do

When you couldn't find the light
At the top of the stairs
When you cried in the night
Well, you knew they were there
Will the light of the day
Was as bright as it seemed
And you knew in your heart
You were livin' the rest of the dream

When you couldn't find the light
At the top of the stairs
When you cried in the night
Well, you knew they were there
Will the light of the day
Was as bright as it seemed
And you knew in your heart
You were livin' the rest of the dream
