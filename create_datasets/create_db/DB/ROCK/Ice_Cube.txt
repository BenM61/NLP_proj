I'm feeling like the ice cube in your glass melting away 
I could close my eyes and go to sleep right here in the ashtray 
Does anybody ever got what they want 
What do you mean when you talk about love, love 

I could make the bed when we awake with a hammer and a nail 
Or make a sandwich of us both but the bread is too stale 
Does anybody ever got what they want 
What do you mean when you talk about love, love, love 

I'm feeling like the ice cube in your mouth melting away 
I don't want to leave, unless of course, you ask me to stay 
Does anybody ever got what they want 
What do you mean when you talk about 
What do you mean when you talk about 
What do you mean when you talk about love
