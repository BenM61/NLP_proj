By the look in your eye I can tell you're gonna cry
Is it over me?
If it is, save your tears
For I'm not worth it, you see
For I'm the type of boy who is always on the roam
Wherever I lay my hat that's my home
I'm telling you that's my home

You had romance, did you break it by chance
Over me?
If it's so I'd like for you to know
That I'm not worth it, you see
For I'm the type of boy who is always on the roam, mm
Wherever I lay my hat that's my home

Oh, you keep telling me, you keep telling me I'm your man
What do I have to do to make you understand?
For I'm the type of guy 
Who gives girl the eye everybody knows
But I love them and I leave them
Break their hearts and deceive them everywhere I go
Don't you know that I'm the type of man who is always on the roam
Wherever I lay my hat that's my home
Wherever I lay my hat, that's my home
Mmm that's my home
And I like it that way

That's my home uhh la la la
That's my home 
Wherever I lay my hat, that's my home
