Well Ive had my fun if I dont get well no more
Well Ive had my fun if I dont get well no more
Yeah my head is spinning
And Im going down slow
Please write my mother tell her the shape Im in
Please write my mother tell her the shape Im in
Tell her to pray for me
Forgive me for my sins

Dont send me no doctor he wont do me no good
Dont send me no doctor he wont do me no good
I said its all my fault
Did do things I shouldnt have... (chris)

Driftin and stumblin like a ship out on the sea
Driftin and stumblin like a ship out on the sea
I aint got nobody
To care for me
