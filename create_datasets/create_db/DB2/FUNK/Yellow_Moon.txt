Yellow moon, yellow moon,
why you keep peeping in my window?
Do you know something I don't know?
Did you see my baby
walking down the railroad tracks?
You can tell me if the girls
ever coming back.

Is she hid out with another
or is she trying to get back home?
Is she wrapped up in some other's arms?
Or is the girl somewhere all alone?
Can you see if she is missing me,
or is she having a real good time?
Has she forgotten all about,
or is the girl still mine all mine?

With your eye so big a shiney
You can see the whole damn land
Yellow moon can you tell me
If the girl's with another man?

Refrain:
Oh yellow moon,
have you seen that creole woman
You can tell me,
Now ain't you a friend of mine.
