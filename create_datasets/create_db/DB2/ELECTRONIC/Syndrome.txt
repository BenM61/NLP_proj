Such a dirty disease fights under your skin
It eats and it burns and it rapes and it turns
Such an infested thing laying eggs within
They hatch in your lungs with dirty tongues

I'm gonna touch you inside
I'm gonna be your little child
Right where your blood runs wild
Inside, that's where I'll hide

Such a violent syndrome taped to your spine
It's a virus storm and it's about to be born

Such a violent word that wants to be heard
You got me deep within and under your skin

I'm gonna touch you inside
I'm gonna be your little child
Right where your blood runs wild
Inside, that's where I'll hide
