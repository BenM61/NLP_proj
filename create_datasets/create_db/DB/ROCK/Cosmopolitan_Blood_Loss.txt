Many ways
Many days
Many faces down the line
When people whisper it makes her nervous

Its you from the airport
Addressing most littlest
In several days I just might prove worth it

[Chorus]
So after all, after all
They let you decide
After all, after all
They let you decide

Anyways
Anyway
Walk the wire, wonder why
When people whisper it makes her nervous

And its you from the airport
Addressing most littlest
Several days too late to unearth it

[Chorus]

We are the most impassioned ugly people
Ugly people
Ugly people, say.

[Chorus]
