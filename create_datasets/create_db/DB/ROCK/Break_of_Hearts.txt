Break of hearts
Drifting to far apart
To be heard
Empty words
Making up too late from a losing start

Break of hearts
Waiting on a loosing game
Fleeting thing
Beautiful thing
There's nothing here worth saving
Too many pieces now all breaking

We were two crazy fools
Running out of things to do
Betting on distant dreams
Getting only empty things

Giving up
We were both beyond trying
I've had enough
There's something here that's dying

Break of hearts
Drifting too long too far apart
To be heard
Empty words
There's nothing here worth saving
Too many pieces now all breaking
