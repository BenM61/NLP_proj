I blinked again and
I wasn't dead
I was a favorite child in it's bed

You had to look
In praise and alarm
Yet I hold nothing
In my arms but my arms

Pouring through me
The world is saved
The world is saved
Take it from me
The world is saved
The world is saved

I clashed with silence
I stumbled and fell
I blinked again, sure
This wasn't hell?

You had to look
In awe and surprise
Yet I'd found nothing
To life but my life

Pouring through me
The world is saved
The world is saved
Take it from me
The world is saved
The world is saved
