There's no one on the radar
No creature in the grove
No reason to be hateful
Life is a treasure trove

And peace of mind is easy to find when the time is right
Come away, come away, come away, come here
Come, I'm callin', come

We'll take a ship to Cairo, 
We'll find the Gods, I'm told
I heard the sun is blinding, 
I hear the streets are gold
We'll build a bridge to Eden 
And then we'll burn it down
We'll never leave, we'll never die
We'll never turn around

Well peace of mind is easy to find when the time is right
So come away, come away, come away, come here
Come, I'm callin', come

Peace of mind
Peace of mind

When the time is right (When the time is right)
When the time is right (When the time is right)
Come away, come away, come away, come here
Come, I'm callin', come
Come away, come away, come away, come here
Come, I'm callin', come

And peace of mind is easy to find when the time is right
So come away, come away, come away, come here
Come, I'm callin', come

It's rattling my bones now, 
It's rushing though my veins
Everything we know is purpose
There's no need to stay in chains
You've got to learn to let go
Just let go and I'll let it be
And every fighter goes down
Just slow down and turn the cheek

Because peace of mind is easy to find when the time is right
So come away, come away, come away, come here
Come, I'm callin', come

Peace of mind is easy to find when the time is right
Come away, come away, come away, come here
Come, I'm callin', come
