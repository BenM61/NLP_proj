Last night I fell in love
It takes control of me when I see love in your eyes your like 
A spring time breeze you send chills through me a natural high
It's just the way you've been my best friend right bye my side 
And there's no one else like you baby last night I realized
That's why

Last night I fell in love see I fell in love with you all over again 
It's true I fell in love with you 

It was unbelievable when you touch me so tenderly your kiss 
Was so sweet and though you will never know it was like a dream
I hope that it will never end please do it again cause it feels 
All right I need someone to pinch me please cause I can't
Believe It happened in one night 

Last night I fell in love see I fell in love with you all over again
It's true I fell in love with you 

Last night felt just like the very first time when you
And I first made love on that first night it would be only right if
We live our lives side by side cause last night I feel in love with you again

Last night I fell in love see I fell in love with you all over again
It's true I fell in love with you 
Last night I fell in love see I fell in love with you all over again 
It's true I fell in love with you 
Last night I fell in love see I fell in love with you all over again 
It's true I fell in love with you
