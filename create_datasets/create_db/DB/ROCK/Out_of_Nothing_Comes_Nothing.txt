This one is for the workers unite,
This one is for the people that believe in a fight,
This one is for everlasting dream to be free,
This one, this one is for liberty.

This is a loading gun mission,
With words as our ammunition,
A mental revolution unviolently.
This one, this one is for anarchy.

There's no strength where there's no struggle,
Without struggle there is no strength.

This is the result of frustration,
Total boredom but we still find motivation,
It's not much but it's a start.
This one, this one comes from the heart.

This is the call of the useless generation.
We await the fall of the great nations.
The flame of freedom burns in our eyes.
We had enough of fucking lies.

There's no strength where's there's no struggle,
Without struggle there is no strength.
There is a light in the end of the tunnel.
There is still time for the wind to change.

Out of nothing comes nothing...
