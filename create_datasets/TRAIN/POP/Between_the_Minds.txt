I've never been the one to shout because I listen
I don't like to raise my voice
But maybe I should learn to lose my inhibitions
And let my feelings make some noise
'Cause you don't know what I'm going through
When silence is all I give to you

So hear me if you're out there
Take these words and try to understand
That I want you and I need you
To take the hand of a quiet man

I love the way you hear the words unspoken
It's like you read between the minds
You know before the silence has been broken
Well, at least most of the time
But I don't know what you're going through
It must be something I didn't say to you

So hear me if your out there
Take these words and try to understand
That I want you and I need you
To take the hand of a quiet man
Of a quiet man

So hear me if your out there
Take these words and try to understand
That I want you and I need you
To take the hand of a quiet man
Of a quiet man, of a quiet man
