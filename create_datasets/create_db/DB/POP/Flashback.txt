I was walking past this woman
Just the other day
From her neck
I felt the very same aroma
She was dipped in that cologne
That you used to spray
I just frozed and realized
That you are gone now

Can't believe
That you and I are separated
Not living together
Remember when you said that night
That you and I would be forever
Reminiscing as the tissue
Wipe the tears away
Wonder if I'm gonna wake up
From this coma

That's when it hit me
Like a flashback
On how it used to be
When you and I were still in love
It hit me like a flashback
Something that reminded me
I can't believe that you are gone 
I can't believe that you are gone

I was driving past your
Neighborhood the other day
Couldn't help from
Staring at your open window
The I heard your favorite song
That you used to play
My whole world just crashed
Like a cymbal

Can't believe
That you and I are separated
Not living together
Remember when you said that night
That you and I would be forever
What I wouldn't do to have you
Coming back my way
Now I'm standing brokenhearted
Lost and single

That's when it hit me
Like a flashback
On how it used to be
When you and I were still in love
It hit me like a flashback
Something that reminded me
I can't believe that you are gone 
I can't believe that you are gone

Just like a time machine
Taking me back to yesterday
A million thoughts
Are running through my head
I think I'll go insane miss you so much
I'm going crazy crazy crazy
Feels like I stumble in a storm
And I can't find my way back
'Cause I just realized I lost
The most precious thing that I had
I'm going crazy crazy crazy

That's when it hit me
Like a flashback
On how it used to be
When you and I were still in love
It hit me like a flashback
Something that reminded me
I can't believe that you are gone
I can't believe that you are gone
