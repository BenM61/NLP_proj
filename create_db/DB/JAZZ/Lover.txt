Lover, when i'm near you
And i hear you speak my name
Softly in my ear you breathe a flame

Lover, when we're dancing
Keep on glancing in my eyes
Till love's own entrancing music dies

All of my future is in you
Your every plan i design
Promise you'll always continue to be mine

Hey lover, please be tender

When your tender fears depart
Lover, i surrender to my heart

I say "the devil is in you"
And to resist you i try
But if you didn't continue i would die

Lover, please be tender
When your tender fears depart
Lover, i surrender to my heart
What a lover
Yes, he is
Sweet lover
