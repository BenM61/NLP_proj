I saw you move
Moving on the dance-floor
I really like
I like what I saw
In time I'm yours
Anyway you want me
Is this a sign you're the one
I've been looking for

You cast your spell
Magic's running through me
The music plays
I'm in heaven boy
I've got what you want
I am the girl for you
No time to lose

Do it, do it, do it to me baby
Do it, do it, do it to me baby

If you wanna
Rock the rhythm with me babe
All through the night
If you wanna
Rock the rhythm with me babe
All through the night
If you wanna
(Keep it comin')
If you wanna
(Keep it comin')
(Keep it comin')
(Keep it comin')

Come on to me
Take me home tonight
Ain't nothing wrong
It could feel alright
Let's lose control
Turn it inside out
We could be getting it on
'Til the morning light

Don't have no doubts
Take a chance on me
I'm ready boy
I'm in ecstasy
I've got what you want
I am the girl for you
No time to lose

Do it, do it, do it to me baby
Do it, do it, do it to me baby

If you wanna
Rock the rhythm with me babe
All through the night

Do it, do it, do it to me baby

If you wanna
Rock the rhythm with me babe
All through the night
If you wanna
Rock the rhythm with me babe
All through the night
If you wanna
Rock the rhythm with me babe
All through the night
If you wanna
Rock the rhythm with me babe
All through the night
If you wanna
(Keep it comin')
(Keep it comin')
(Keep it comin')

If you wanna
Rock the rhythm with me babe
All through the night
If you wanna
Rock the rhythm with me babe
All through the night
If you wanna
Rock the rhythm with me babe
All through the night

If you wanna
If you wanna
If you wanna

If you wanna
If you wanna
If you wanna
