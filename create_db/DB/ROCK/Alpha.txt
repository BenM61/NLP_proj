We're going to do a song called alpha!

(Just move) you never were there (when I needed you)
Where were you when I needed you
(So long) look me in the eyes when I'm talking to ya
You see the whites now (turn around) walk away can't help me) you never wanted too
(Soon I'll show you) what I mean cause

(I) don't need for you to rescue me
(From what) you believe is tear'n me apart, you'll never
(Know) how it feels to be like me
(F*ck you) I relieve you of the duty that you gave
(To yourself)

(Face down) in your own shit you look up at me
In your eyes is something like pity for me
(Reach) up from the bottom lend a helpless hand
(You volunteer to be) my true savior

(You can't help me) but if you wanted too
(I would show you) what I see cause

(I) don?t need for you to rescue me
(From what) you believe is tear'n me apart, you'll never
(Know) how it feels to be like me
(F*ck you) I remind you of the duty that you gave
(To yourself)
(Face down)

(Just move) you never were there 
When needed you
(Face down) in your own shit you look up at me
(You can't help me)

(I) don't need for you to rescue me
(From what) you believe is tear'n me apart, you'll never
(Know) how it feels to be like me
(F*ck you) I relieve you of the duty that you gave
(To yourself)

(Now go f*ck yourself)
