You don't feel damned between the sunrise and sunset
You're damned well panicky, I know the rainy days
Please them or run on the turf
You could be raising money with your momma
You might be sure when you're round and dressed up with kid
Take a toast to that, imbibe, you're alone
Men are so nice
(Lays can be)
Roses may fly
Men are so useful
(He's a flirt)
Men are so useful
(Reflection beauty)
Men are so nice
He pleases me fine
(Reflection beauty)
Men are so useful
(Be able to feel)

(Fine, fine (x4))
