When the day is dawnin'
On a Texas Sunday mornin'
How I long to be there
With Marie who's waitin' for me there.
Ev'ry lonely city where I hang my hat
Ain't as half as pretty as where my baby's at.

Is this the way to Amarillo?
Ev'ry night I've been huggin' my pillow
Dreamin' dreams of Amarillo
And sweet Marie who waits for me.
Show me the way to Amarillo
I've been weepin' like a willow
Cryin' over Amarillo
And sweet Marie who waits for me.

Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la
And Marie who waits for me.

There's a church bell ringin'
Hear the sound of joy that it's singin'
For the sweet Maria
And the guy who's comin' to see her.
Just beyond the highway
Lies an open plain
And it keeps me goin'
Through the wind and rain.

Is this the way to Amarillo?
Ev'ry night I've been huggin' my pillow
Dreamin' dreams of Amarillo
And sweet Marie who waits for me.
Show me the way to Amarillo
I've been weepin' like a willow
Cryin' over Amarillo
And sweet Marie who waits for me.

Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la
And Marie who waits for me.

Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la
And Marie who waits for me.

Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la
And Marie who waits for me.
