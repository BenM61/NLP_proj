Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see
Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see

Won't someone please explain, why all the hurt and the pain?
Can't you make 'em see, it's not supposed to be
All this beautiful land, see the children playing in the sand
I put to you this question
Total destruction and I don't understand why

Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see
Sometimes it seems that way to me, yeah
It's easier to love, don't you see
Sometimes it seems that way to me, oh
It's easier to love, don't you see

What more can I say, war is no game you play
Give a person a little might
Well, that don't make him right
And I hope and pray, oh please let the children play
All this killing each other, you should be loving your brother
And I don't understand why, why

Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see
Sometimes it seems that way to me, yeah
It's easier to love, don't you see
Sometimes it seems that way to me, oh
It's easier to love, don't you see

Yeah, let me hear you say
I do, I love you, I do, I love you, I do, I love you, I do, I love you
I do, I love you, I do, I love you, I do, I love you, I do, I love you
And I don't understand why

Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see
Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see
Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see
Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see
