Michelle, ma belle
These are words that go together well
My Michelle

Michelle, ma belle
Sont des mots qui vont tres bien ensemble
Tres bien ensemble

I love you, I love you, I love you
That's all I want to say
Until I find a way, I will say
The only words I know that you'll understand

Michelle, ma belle
Sont des mots qui vont tres bien ensemble
Tres bien ensemble

I need to, I need to, I need to
I need to make you see
What you mean to me, until I do
I'm hoping you will know what I mean
My Michelle

I want you, I want you, I want you
I think, you know that by now
I'll get to you some how and until I do
I'm telling you so you'll understand
My Michelle

My Michelle
My Michelle
Michelle
