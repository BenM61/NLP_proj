I love acting, I'm not acting
Swipe that old thing for this new thing
In the city we drive taxi
In the front seat you won't find me
You keep your friends, I'll keep my friends
Have a party in the West End
Make some money, make more money
With your new friends throw a party

I've got silver and signet ring
From night climbing and fine dining
I love sex and I love dancing
And reclining in your backseat
You keep your friends, I'll keep my friends
Have a party in the West End
Make some money, make more money
With your new friends throw a party
Watch your percent, watch your money
And stop acting, acting funny
In the city we smoke taxi
In the backseat's where you'll find me
You keep your friends, I'll keep my friends
Have a party in the West End
Make some money, make more money
With your new friends throw a party

You keep your friends, I'll keep my friends
Have a party in the West End
Make some money, make more money
With your new friends throw a party
