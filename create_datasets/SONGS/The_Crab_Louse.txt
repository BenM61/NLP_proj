(Super Scratcher With A Golden Shower Rainbow Mix) 
I want to talk to you about forbidden pleasures of the flesh 
The most thrilling satisfaction for all mankind 
Better than everything you've ever imagined in your wildest dreams 

The secret of ? the crab louse 
Here's a message for the girls about vaginas 
And the consequence of fiddling with a partner 
Mind your labia they're never out of danger 

If you're gonna go to bed with a stranger 
Creatures might be hidden in his pubic area 
It's the crab louse it's out to getcha 
It's gonna grab you by the pubic hair 

Shake your pussy when the bastard's there 
It's there to stay 
Sucks all day 
It's there to bite 

My parasite 
The little vampire, horny and so greedy 
It doesn't care about a penis and it's envy 
Its intelligence is nasty and it's sick 

A party animal, a pervert, and a pig If a crab louse mixes up with your saliva 
Stumbles through your body right into your vulva 
Then waits patiently until a penetration 
Gets it out of there and right into salvation 

It's there to stay 
Sucks all day 
It's there to bite 
My parasite 

My love machine 
My maddest dream 
Turns me on 
Makes me cum 

Now we know the little crab louse is a raver 
You can't get rid of it unless you use a razor 
It's unbearable, funky and so cool 
A real smartass and nobody's fool 

If you meet a guy who's scratching at his totem 
We all know that it's connected with his scrotum 
He might tell you his undie is too tight 
You will know that it's a crab louse and you're right 

It's there to stay 
Sucks all day 
It's there to bite 
My parasite 

My love machine 
My maddest dream 
Turns me on 
Makes me cum
