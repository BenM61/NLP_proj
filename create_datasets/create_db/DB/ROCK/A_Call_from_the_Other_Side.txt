
Come on and get it while it's here coz it's running out and you're in a rush
Don't want to get it over there, want to get it here but you ain't the first
Come on and get it from me - come on and get it fast
Come on and get it while it's here coz it's fading out and it ain't gonna last

Hear a call from the other side
I'll give you one good reason one that's gonna get you high

I got it sitting at my place waitin for you to call I got it sitting here
Got it ready got it wrapped waitin for your call and I am itching here

You're like a glass of water and I'll throw you on the coals
You're like a glass of water I'll throw you on my coals

Hear a call from the other side
I'll give you one good reason, one to be reckoned, one that's gonna get you high
Yeah hear a call from the other side 
I'll give you one good reason - one that's gonna get you high

One good reason - to go out on a limb
One good reason - to face the void
One good reason - to leave the rest behind
I'll give you one good reason

Hear a call from the other side
I'll give you one good reason one that's gonna get you high

I'll give you one good reason, one to be reckoned 
one to get it going it is time to put the rest behind
I'll give you one good reason to go out on a limb
to face the void to be looking it right into the eye.
One good reason
