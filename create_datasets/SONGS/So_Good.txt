Damn, your lovin got me tranked out, the handkerchief out
We walk the bank route
Shorty be careful with your link out
Miss Fendi girl, Wimbledon chick who rock a stick shift
Photogenic, crazy athletic, mad equipped, tempted
Using your mind, that's the jewel of life
Science is right
Walking the righteous path
Peace God, love you mad
So when you're zonin from the head start we blessin your heart
Peace, I'm outta here girl, check out the best part

Never have I been so mystified by anyone's love before
Hey, I feel so natural
I keep comin back for more
And each time we touch you open up a new door

Baby you're such a midnight tease
It's gonna take everything to keep you from me, hey
And the joy that your lovin brings
Can separate the mountains from the sea

I don't want to be wrong
But it feels right
If loving you is so wrong
I don't want to go on
I don't want to be wrong
But it feels right
It feels good
So good, so good, so good

Spent so many nights believing I was wrong for you bein in my life
I can't ignore it when some say that it ain't right
(It ain't right)
I decided you're the best thing that happened in my life

I haven't had everything, oh no
But you come close to everything that love means, hey yeah
In heaven's eyes love is embraced between you and I
Now that we have each other I don't have to dream

I don't want to be wrong
But it feels right
If loving you is so wrong
I don't want to go on
I don't want to be wrong
But it feels right
It feels good
So good, so good, so good

I don't want to be wrong
But it feels right
If loving you is so wrong
I don't want to go on
I don't want to be wrong
But it feels right
It feels good
So good, so good, so good

I don't want to be wrong
But it feels right
If loving you is so wrong
I don't want to go on
I don't want to be wrong
But it feels right
It feels good
So good, so good, so good
