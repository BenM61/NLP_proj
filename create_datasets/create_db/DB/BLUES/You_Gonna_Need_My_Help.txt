You're going to need
You're going to need my help, I say
You know I won't have to worry
I'll have everything going my way

Well, you wake up in the morning
Your face so full of frowns
Asked you, "What's wrong?"
You say, "I'm sorry, I'm putting you down!"

Well, you're going to need
You're going to need my help, I say
You know I won't have to worry
Because I'll have everything going my way

Well, you leave home in the morning
And you won't come back tonight
You won't give me no food
You still say you treat me right
