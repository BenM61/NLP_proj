Get up! It's time! 
Get up and make it snappy! 

Dance like a psycho 
A sight like nothing on earth 
Keep a wide berth 
From anyone you might know 
So no first night nerves 
All first serves! All aces! 
Straight home bases 
Sweating like a pig doing the jig 
At the gig of the century 
Because we'll never be 
Told by the old school 
Sold the old rules 
Tho' we're no fools 
Downbeats down to earth 
You down with me? 
Clowning round the town 
Step easy 
Cooking up new tricks 
Looking for a new kick 
Found a new sound 
Found that it sticks 

Heard about the bird 
'Bout the plane and 
The superman? 
Word is: We can outlast anyone 
Supercede the superfly guys 
Who will concede 
They are dying flies 
This range of suss 
Could be dangerous 
Let's test! At best it's religious 
At worst a thirst 
Bursting for the next rhyme 
All times sacred 
Even stripped naked 
This damned nation 
Needing salvation 
Reach out! 
Teach in musical elation 
Shout! Get out of it get within it 
Get out of it get within it 

All the way mad and bad 
All the way hyped 
Play it mad DJ! Play it bad DJ 
All the way mad and bad 
All the way hyped 

Are you with me 
Are you with it? 

A musical nasty 
Fast as it has to be 
A catastrophe 
Heavy duty chaos 
'cause I'm all attitude 
The dude to kickstart 
The party mood 
Cue the truth: 
Sleuths are never sober 
The proof of youth 
So move over rover 
Hey! Disco King 
You've stopped dancing 

Best admit 
This hit's an obsession 
Lost in lust 
Better listen to the lessons 
Bright lights big city 
Broad minds 
Bored pretty easily 
Busted just for justice sake 
They can't control a soul 
Ther's an outbreak 
Of outrageous love 
It's contageous and 
It's here to save us 
Some say: 
"Now way DJ don't play 
The laterst the greatest 
The mad and bad way." 
If it ain't music use it abuse it 
Call it a wall of noise 
But don't refuse it 

This damned nation 
Needing salvation 
Reach out! 
Teach in musical elation 
Shout! Get out of it get within it 
Get out of it get within it 
Dedicated to all the bores 
All the whores 
Who forced the laws 
You thought 
We'd stop dancing and 
You were wrong 

1-2-3-4-5-6-7 
Kiss my ass and go to heaven 
Y.O.U. spells you
