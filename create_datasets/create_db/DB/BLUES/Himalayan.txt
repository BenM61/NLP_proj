Himalayan, bigger than you or me
I'm just saying, it's unnatural history
Put on your Bonnie and Clyde grin, your crackle and sin
Gonna hear the coin drop that's when it's gonna begin

Say that you know, the path that you're gonna walk to be free
Throw your hands up, kick back your heels and dance to the beat

I woke up, in the middle of the night
Started praying, just like a tribalite
and when you lick your lips and you're moving in fits
Gonna hear the coin drop that's when it will hit

Say that you know the path that you're gonna walk, to be free
Throw your hands up, kick back your heels and dance to the beat

Himalayan, Himalayan, Himalayan, Himalayan

Say that you know the path that you're gonna walk, to be free
Throw your hands up, kick back your heels and dance to the beat
Say that you know the path that you're gonna walk, to be free
Throw your hands up, kick back your heels and dance to the beat
