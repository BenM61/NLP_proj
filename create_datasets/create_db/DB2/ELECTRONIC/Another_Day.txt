Is it really over?
Between us two,
Then why don't you love me?
The way that I still love you,
So many mistakes made,
In so little time,
Girl I'm so regretful,
I must have been out of my mind. 

I don't want to live another day
Without you by my side
I don't want to run anymore
Running out of places to hide
Ever since you went away
Slowly I've seen
That I shoulda got
Down on my knees
And begged you to stay with me 

And what I'm feeling for you,
Never could I try to hide,
The fact that I adore you,
Always seems to come outside,
You were my heartbeat,
The reason I breathe,
Please baby forgive me,
While I'm down on my knees 

I don't want to live another day
Without you by my side
I don't want to run anymore
Running out of places to hide
Ever since you went away
Slowly I've seen
That I shoulda got
Down on my knees
And begged you to stay with me 

I don't want to live another day
Without you by my side
I don't want to run anymore
Running out of places to hide
Ever since you went away
Slowly I've seen
That I shoulda got
Down on my knees
And begged you to stay with me 

I shoulda got down on my knees
And begged you to stay with me 

I don't want to see
I don't want to throw
I can't see the night
You're my heart and soul
