Ooh, baby wait for me
Ooh, baby wait for me

I know that you're so fine
That men would stand in line
For a chance to kiss you on the cheek
This is the gift God gave for you to be this way
And you surely use it naturally

Alone in my room all night
Fantasies of our life
The past of those memories last

To wait is all that I ask

Ooh, baby wait for me
Umm, umm, umm
Ooh, baby wait for me

I'm just the kind of man
I know just who I am
In your tender arms
I'd like to be
While other guys tell you
That they want you too
I'm persistent baby
I know what to do-oo-oo

Oh

Alone in my room all night
Fantasies of our life
The past of those memories last
To wait is all that I ask

Don't go nowhere baby, baby

Alone in my room all night
Fantasies of our life
The past of those memories last
To wait is all that I ask

How do you know?

Ooh, baby wait for me
Ooh, baby wait for me
