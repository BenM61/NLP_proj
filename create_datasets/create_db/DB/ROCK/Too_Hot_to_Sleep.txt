Sweat rollin down my hands and face,
Big fan on the screen porch turnin',
Cat looking for a hiding place,
Sun's sinking but the fire's still burnin',
Music playin' a few doors down
I'm drawn to the sound,
It's just too hot to sleep

I walk restless to the street cafe'
See what's shakin' at the drop-in zone
A cold Corona and a twist of lime,
Cools me down when I'm alone
Movin' closer from across the room,
I've seen her before and she looks so fine.
I never wanted any woman more,
I look at the door and she reads my mind.

Too hot to sleep!!
Give up the fight,
Throw back the sheets, 
Oh! shoot out the lights
Too Hot to sleep!!
Come take me higher, 
Caught up in the heat
Of the moments fire.

Still burning in the after-glow,
Sun peekin' through mirrored glasses.
A little groggy from the night before.
Feeling wild as the day advances
Can't seem to keep my mind off you.
It's just no use , It's blind desire.
I want to know that I can count on you
To throw a little gasoline on the fire!!

In the heat of the night, Oh I, tossed
And I turned.
Come share the heat of the night passin' by us!!
