Oh boys, I'm Hollywood bound
She not from the East
She not from the West
I'm so crazy 'bout my baby
I love the way she wears her dress

Oh boys, I'm Hollywood bound
Hmm, she's not my color (Not my color)
She's jus' my style (She's just my style)
Hmm boys, I'm crazy 'bout my baby
All of California's gonna know she's mine
