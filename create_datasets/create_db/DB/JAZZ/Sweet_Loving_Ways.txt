Can it be a part of me has changed a lot
That you have come into my life and brought so much?

With your sweet loving ways, I don't want to change
The sweet loving ways, let me just say
That your sweet loving ways have saved

I remember watching you from far away
Now my love grows stronger near you everyday

With your sweet loving ways, I don't want to change
The sweet loving ways, let me just say
That your sweet loving ways have saved

Every night in your bed
Everyday in my head
How those nerves sound so clear
As I hold you so near

You saved me, you saved me
You saved me, you saved me
You saved me, you saved me

Sweet loving ways, don't you change
Sweet loving ways, don't you change
Sweet loving ways, don't you change
Sweet loving ways

Every night in your bed
Everyday in my head
How those words sound so clear
As I hold you so near

Can it be a part of me has changed a lot
That you have come into my life and brought so much?

With your sweet loving ways, I don't want to change
The sweet loving ways, let me just say
That the sweet loving ways, I don't want to change
The sweet loving ways, let me just say

That your sweet loving ways, with them I'm saved
The sweet loving ways, I don't want to change
And your sweet loving ways, let me just say
The sweet loving ways, with them I'm saved
