Make it count,
Play it straight.
Don't look back,
Don't hesitate.
When you go big time.

Whatcha want,
Whatcha feel.
Never quit,
Make it real.
When you roll big time.

Whatcha gotta lose?
Go and make your luck with the life you choose,
If you want it all,
Lay it on the line.
It's the only life ya got,
So ya gotta live it big time.

Step it up,
Get in gear.
Go for broke,
Make it clear.
Gotta go big time.

Get it right.

Gotta dream big time.

Look around,
Every light is shining now,
It's brighter somehow.
Look around,
Nothing's really as it seems,
Nothing but dreams.
You and I,
Gonna make a brand new sound,
Like we own this town.

We can't die,
Now our feet are off the ground,
We'll never look down.
Welcome to the big time,
All the pretty people see you walking in the sunshine.
Welcome to the good times,
Life will never be the same.

Go shake it up!

So ya gotta live it big time.

If you want it all,
Lay it on the line
It's the only life ya got,
So ya gotta live it big time.
