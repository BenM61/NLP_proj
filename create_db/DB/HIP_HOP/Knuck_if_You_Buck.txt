Punch 'em dead up in his nose
And stomp his a** down to the flo'

Throwin'dem bows like Johnny Cage
All my n****s startin' riots
Knockin down the barracade
Everywhere we be to deep
And M.O.B is to elite
The flawless n****s lawless 
You be jawless gettin' close to me
Bullets bussin' constantly
Ravagin' yo' city streets
Broken bones lay alones scattered 'cross the concrete
Knuckin' if you buckin' you'll be duckin'
If you get too close
In my eyes you wasn't wise
I think it's time I knuck you ho

I come in da club
Shakin my dreads, throwin these bows
And bussin these heads
B**** you irrelevant step to my residence
Besta back up boy I thank you for that 
I'ma a Diamond committing no crime
Not leavin a trace not leavin a line
We knuckin and buckin 'cause I got a nine
I blow you away 'cause you wastin my time
Stupid a** n****s y'all know what to do

You talkin bout me then I'm talkin' to you
You buckin on us 'cause we leadin' yo cla** 
Keep bussin' on me and that s*** gone get nasty

Bussin off the rip soon as a hit the do'
