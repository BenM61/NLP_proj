Sometimes I just don't feel like waking up
Wanna stay inside my dreams
Sometimes I feel like I am breaking up
Do you know just how that feels

Hope is for the hopeful
It's a dream that never dies
Safe is for the faithful
I see it in your eyes

And I got angels on my side
I got angels flying high
And everything will be alright
'Cause I got angels on my side

I need the people that I really love
To only give me truth
Don't fake it, I can't take it
My heart is close to breaking
It reminds me of my youth

Hope is for the hopeful
It's a dream that never fades
Faith is for the faithful
And I will not be swayed

'Cause I got angels on my side
I got angels flying high
And everything will be alright
'Cause I got angels on my side

Everything will be alright

Everything will be alright
'Cause I got angels on my side
Oh, yeah

Can you see them?
Can you see them?

I got angels on my side
Angels flying high
And everything will be alright
'Cause I got angels on my side

I got angels, you got angels
Everybody got their angels on their side
Everything's gonna be alright
You got angels, I got angels
Everybody got their angels by their side
It's alright, it's alright
I got angels, you got angels
Everybody got an angel by their side
We got angels on my side
I got angels, you got angels
Everybody got their angels by their side
Oh, yeah
