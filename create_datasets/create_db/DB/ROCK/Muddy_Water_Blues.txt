Walking alone in the rain
Water in my shoes
All I can feel is this pain in my heart
And these Muddy Water Blues

River weep for me
Got nothing left to loose
Under the weeping willow tree
With these Muddy Water Blues

Muddy Water Blues
Muddy Water Blues
Muddy Water Blues
Ooh, tell me to lose

Try to get free from you, baby
Oh, but I'm stuck like glue
Try to get free from you, baby
No one else but you
(No one else)
Hey, yeah

Muddy Water Blues
Muddy Water Blues
I got the Muddy Water Blues, yeah, yeah
Somebody tell me, tell me to lose

The women and whiskey will frame you
It's no good you're looking for clues
You got them bad and who can blame you?
Muddy Water Blues, hey, yeah

Muddy Water Blues
Tell me now, Muddy Water Blues
I got the Muddy Water Blues
Hey, hey, hey, now tell me to lose

Muddy, Muddy Water Blues
Yeah, Muddy my Water Blues
You got the Muddy Water Blues
Tell me, tell me, tell me to lose
(Tell me to lose)
