I Will Try
I Will Try Not To Lose My Own
If You Cry
That Secret Down
Open Up Your Eyes Again
Even You Can Try
Don't You Think You Toil In Vain
What Have You Come To Be To Be Now?

Stop For A Minute
You Better Change Your Heart In Time
Stop For A Minute
You Can Believe That Part Of Mine
I'll Be Protectin' You
From What You Run Into
If You Will Hold On
Stop For A Minute

I Rely
I Rely On My Chance To Know
You And I
Could Feel As One
Open Up And Start Again
An' Take A Look Around
Don't You See What I Have Meant
What Have You Come To Be Now?

Stop For A Minute
You Better Change Your Heart In Time
Stop For A Minute
You Can Believe That Part Of Mine
I'll Be Protectin' You
From What You Run Into
If You Will Hold On
Stop For A Minute

And What Is Left To You
Where Are You Goin' To
That Sorrow In Your Life In Your Life
What Did You Come To Be To Be Now?

Stop For A Minute
You Better Change Your Heart In Time
Stop For A Minute
You Can Believe That Part Of Mine
I'll Be Protectin' You
From What You Run Into
If You Will Hold On
Stop For A Minute

Stop For A Minute...
