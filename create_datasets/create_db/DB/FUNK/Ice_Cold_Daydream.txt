I looked at you, girl, I saw a smile
For my love, you said you'd walk a mile
Today I see your face, you wear a frown
Now you're telling me that I'm a clown
What's the reason for this sudden change?
I never thought you'd act so strange

You say that I'm a boy and we should part
So you can go and make a brand new start
You laughed at me and then I almost cried
You hurt my heart so bad I had to hide
What's the reason for this sudden change?
I never thought that you would act so strange

I'm gettin' tired of listenin' to you talk
I think I'll go outside and take a walk
Took my guitar and got up off the floor
I must have dozed off while you were next door

My mind's at ease now I know that you're on my side
That ice cold daydream took me for an ugly ride
