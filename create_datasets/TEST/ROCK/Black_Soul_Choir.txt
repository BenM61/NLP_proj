Ain't none ever seen the face of his foe no 
He ain't made of flesh & bone 
He's the one who sits up close beside you 
An when he's there you are alone 
Every man is evil yes an every man is a liar 
An unashamed with the wicked tongues sing 
In the black soul choir 
Yes an no man ever seen the face of my lord no 
Not since he left his skin 
He's the one you keep cold on the outside girl 
He's at your door let him in 
O I will forgive your wrongs 
Yes I am able 
An for my own I feel great shame 
I would offer up a brick to the back of your head boy 
If I were cain
