Till then, my darling, please wait for me
(Baby, baby, till then)
Till then, no matter when it will be
(Baby, baby, till then)
One day I know I'll be back again
Please wait till then

Till then, our love will live though we are apart
(Baby, baby, till then)
Our love, I know we'll keep in our hearts
(Baby, baby, till then)
Till then, when all the world will be free
Please wait for me

Although there are oceans we must cross
And mountains that we must climb
I know every game must have a loss
So pray that our loss is nothing but time

Till then, let's dream of what there will be
Till then, we'll call on each memory
Till then, when I will hold you again
(When I will hold you again)
Please wait till then

Till then, we'll dream of what there will be
(Baby, baby, till then)
Till then, we'll call on each memory
(Baby, baby, till then)
Till then, when I will hold you again
Please wait till then
