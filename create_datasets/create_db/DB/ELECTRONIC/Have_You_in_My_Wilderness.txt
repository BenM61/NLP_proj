Shake me awake!
Am I the man you see
Through your mystery eyes?
Oh yea, I second that emotion

You'll see lightning cascading
Pronouncements of our love

Lady of gold, you would fit beautiful in my wilderness
In your waters I've dropped anchor

You'll see lightning cascading
Pronouncements of our love

Tell me, why do I feel you running away?
