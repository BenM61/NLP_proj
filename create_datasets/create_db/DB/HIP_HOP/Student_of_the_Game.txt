I feel like something special bout to happen
Queens nigga but the meetings be up in Manhattan
Move the packs fast, hoops ain't full crick
We up to cook another one, bullshit
We should have the hood Olympics, a cook off
Let's see which coke is terrific and who is gifted
With the coffee pot, biggest hold the cookie jar
Let us separate the hustlers from the rookies y'all
I knew enough Spanish not to get jerked when I want work
Plus plus, plus I let my gun off, beserk
Got my cousins in the pink houses, never had job niggas
They was into murdering, kidnaps and rob niggas
I was to rhyme as a hobby in my closet lobby
Fuckin' up ounces, take it back to quarters then
Ho sales with Sa Kimble, even show I water min
Fast forward, got locked for a shooting
Hits whop it, back when like kings first recruitin'
Locked in the zone, mind separate - guidance counselor,
I went to school with a weapon, not for protection
Just to show it off, but I'm gon really use it
The power of the gun, it gave me strength, I would abuse it
I never ever ever thought I'd make it out in music
Started writing rhymes harder, and to vision the youth
Locked up, readin' Daniel Gorren's books
Expanding my imagination, I got created with the bendo
Started writing rhymes loud the streets, stand a symbol
My persona identified
Hood pride, logical, wrote about the blocks, streets and the obstacles
Man, this shit work when you think about it
I mean I still get money when you think about it
Rap, probably saved my life twice with it
I'm still nice with it, let's forget all the ice with ice
Forget my accolades and other big things I did
I was a wild kid, I would've ran up in yo crib
Remember war report, CNN legacy
Hip-hop pedigree, rhymes is a felony
Student of the game, I take responsibility
Give me tranquility so niggas can't belittle me
I'm still doing what I do way past you
This album's home the heart, sorta feel like I have to
Prove shit, do the new shit
And the true school shit, wild with the deuces
Little guns for the little guns gala
Blade back, in a leather couch, harawana
Eye vision clearer, I love who I see in the mirror
I couldn't make that clearer
Try to compete with a real street nigga
Doing street shit, you as soft as aloe vera hah?

Something special bout to happen
Queens nigga, Queens nigga
I'm still nice with it
Cook another one
Separate the hustlers from the rookies y'all
CNN, CNN legacy
Hip-hop hop pedigree
Rhymes is a felony
Bill doin' what up dude?
True school shit, real street niggas
