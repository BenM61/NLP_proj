Up behind the Bus-stop in the toilets off the street
There are traces of  a killing on the floor beneath your feet
Mixed up with the piss and beer are bloodstains on the floor

Homophobia
The worst disease
You can't love who you want to love in times like these
Homophobia
The worst disease
You can't love who you want to love in times like these

In the pubs, clubs and burgerbars breeding pens for pigs
Alcohol, testosterons and ignorance and fist
Packs of hunting animals roam across the town
They find an easy victim and they punch him to the ground

Homophobia
The worst disease
You can't love who you want to love in times like these
Homophobia
The worst disease
You can't love who you want to love in times like these

The siren of the ambulance the deadpan of the cops
Chalk to mark the outline where the boy first dropped
Beware the holy trinity - church and state and law
For every death the virus gets more deadly then before

Homophobia
The worst disease
You can't love who you want to love in times like these
