With his arms around your love
Oh no, here comes the pain that you can't ignore

With his arms around your girl
He'll do all of the things you didn't do before
You had every chance, but you closed the door

[Chorus]
Now you're just gonna have to take it
('Cause if you didn't know)
She's gonna make you pay for it
(Price you can't afford)
You're just gonna have to take it
With his arms around your love [Repeat: x3]

Oh, yeah

Pretend that you don't mind
But you know everything that you left behind

And it would have been alright
If you'd gave half of the praise that you held inside
You thought she'd hang around for the ride

[Chorus]

Coming clean feels so dangerous
Just a little bit would have been enough
But you never said all the words caught in your head

As if your heart was dead
Well now its surely bled and broken up

And it would have been alright
If you'd gave half of the praise that you held inside
You thought she'd hang around for the ride

[Chorus]

(Take it) With his arms around your love
(Pay for it) With his arms around your love
With his arms around your love
With his arms around your love
