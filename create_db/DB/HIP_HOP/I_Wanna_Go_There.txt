Yo I want to go there
And I think you gonna like it
Just when I get there get ready

Sit back and relax,
Let me do my thing
I'm about to go there
For that old time swing
Anything that you want
Anything you desire babe
Just let me know 
Cause you light my fire lady

[Bridge]
I can tell that you want me tonight
All I came to do is make it right
Let's get sweaty in front of the fire place

It's on
Bring it on
Cause I'm ready

[Chorus]
I want to go there with you
And do all the things no one would do
I want to go where no one has been
I want to go there with you
So I gotta go there
I want to go there with you
And give you everything you need me to
I want to go where no one has been
I want to go there with you

Girl I know this is new
But keep an open mind
After I do this once
You gonna want it all the time
Girl you got me babe
Long as you keep it real
I see you like the appetizer
Here's the main course meal

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Listen
The temperature is rising
And all I came to do is make you feel all right
Cause I came to please your body, please your body
The way that we made love
Made me forget that was me and your first night
And I want to go there

[Chorus]

Should I lick my lips (oh yeah)
Should I grab on them hips (yeah yeah)
Should I start to do it real slow ( oh yeah)
And go in where no one else could go
Should I try to make you sweat
Should I take you all the way there
Should I make you bust once or twice
Girl I'm gonna give you bragging rights

[Chorus]
