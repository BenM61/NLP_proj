It's such a beautiful day to be feeling like this 
Don't you think about anything that might make you miss 
That ray of light, something that might drag you down 

If I could give you just a blue sky, get you out of the dark 
Cause you've been going round in circles and you never stop 
To look around 
You're losing out on the best part 

I find myself turning the other way when I don't understand 
I can?t help feeling I'm the one to blame for all your pain 

This is our time to fly 
And I don't want to leave you behind 
It should be you and I on the same side 

You don't know what you have til the moment has gone 
Catch it while you can cause this ride won't last very long 
You look so bright 
You look so bright through my eyes 

I want you to know your place is here with me 
If that's what you want 

This is our time to fly 
And I don't want to leave you behind 
It should be you and I on the same side 

Have I got you too close? 
Do you really want to let go? 
Cause I love you more than you'll ever know 
But if it's hurting you, what can I do? 

From now on this is our time to fly 
And I don't want to leave you behind 
It should be you and I on the same side 

This is our chance to try 
Both of us under one sky 
It should be you and I on the same side
