When push comes to a shovin'
I'd rather make some lovin'
And if I'm being sneaky
For something too, too freaky

I get high on you
I get high on you
What'd you say?
High on you
I get high on you

Naturally, my temperature is risin'
I hope you're realizin'
To know you is my pleasure
'Cause you're my only treasure

So I get high on you
I get high on you
I get high on you
High on you
Singin' high on you

Even when I'm sleepin'
Your body seems to creepin'
And surely will wake me
But my (Incomprehensible) will take me

I get high on you
Get high on you
You know I enjoy it
I get high on you

(I get little)
I get high on you
I get high on you
High on you
High on you, my baby
I get high
