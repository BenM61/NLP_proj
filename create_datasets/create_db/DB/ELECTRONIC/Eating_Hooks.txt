Why must I hide
In the forest of my mind?
I want to come out of the woods

They offer me shade
A face with no name
A game I can play
But I can't beat it

Meditation, medication
I'm eating the hooks that tear me
Meditation, medication
I'm eating the hooks that tear me

I'm walking back
Through my living hell
To eat the hooks that tear
Somehow I'm not scared of this

Meditation, medication
I'm eating the hooks that tear me

Under my skin
Lies the world feeding
The cure of my sin
The cure of my sin
The cure of my sin
The cure of my sin
