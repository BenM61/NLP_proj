And I'm not sure what this is all about,
As we watch the waves crashing in and out, 
And only they know what we've found
And it almost feels like day time now

Somehow we gonna make it through
I'll break every single rule for you
Well I'll try to least anyway

We decided to turn our world around,
We can drive away from this loser town
Have to escape or go insane, 
A thousand miles an hour through the rain.

And we're not sure if we even know
Just where we are or where we're gonna go
But we're not afraid, not tonight 
Gonna try all we can to get it right
