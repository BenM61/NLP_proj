We won't get far
Flying in circles inside a jar
'Cause the air we breathe
Is thinning with the words that we speak

That we speak
You and me
That we speak
You and me

You're on the floor
Fearful of what's outside your door
But the codes and keys
They can protect you
From the pangs of jealousy

When you scream
Love you see
Like a child
Throwing stones at the sky
When they fall back to earth
As minor chords of major works
Separate rooms of single life
We are one
We are alive

We are alive
We are alive
We are alive
We are alive
