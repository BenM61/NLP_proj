So many times I dream of somebody just like you 
So many times I wish that one little dream came true 
For though I'm asleep or awake I see your face 
Oh, why does the dawn have to break our sweet embrace? 
So many times I breathe your name and sweet music starts 
I only hope that same ol' song is in both our hearts 
To hear you confess that your care has been my prayer 
So many times, my darling, so many times!
