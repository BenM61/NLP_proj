What does it matter if we're rich or we're poor
Fortune and fame they never endure
For love is the thing, love is the thing

What good is money if your heart isn't light
Here in your arms I'm wealthy tonight
When youth has its fling, love is the thing

While others fight for power
We can walk among the flowers
Knowing that the best thing in life
Is the thing that's free
Love for you and me

And even though our castles crumble and fall
We have the right to laugh at them all
For love is still king, love is the thing

And even though our castles crumble and fall
We have the right to laugh at them all
For love is still king, love is the thing
