I do not see the way out
I do not really know how
Like a shot in the dark went your hallowed ground
Had you taken too much
Keep him well out of touch 
And refused to let him go
I cannot see to your pain
I do not hear you complain
You are now but a dot in the pouring rain
You created this mess
Now he's bent to your stress
And it seems to suit you well

One and only
Two can be lonely
One last child
Blessed and unholy
In his eyes the storm's surely rising up
Doo doo doo doo doo doo

I do not see the way out
You cannot turn this around
Like a walk in the dark
You have weighed him down
I can't stand in your place
Can't take this away
It was all too good to be true

You never talk about it
You never scream about it
You took a spirit young and whole
And turned the child to an old soul

You never talk about it
You never screamed about it
You covet things that you don't own
You turned the child to an old soul
