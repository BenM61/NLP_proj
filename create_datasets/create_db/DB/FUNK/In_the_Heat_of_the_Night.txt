In a cold hard world when you're out on your own

Oh
there's a cruel harsh word you'll get to know.
No one understands what it's like in misery

All the great demands your love has made on me
In the heat
in the heat of the night.
In the heat
in the heat of the night.

As their faces turn everywhere that you go

It's the eyes that burn right through to your sole.
Feel the rhythm of the street

A distant scream from who knows where 
Now the picture is complete 
Through the dark and running scared. 
In the heat
in the heat of the night.
In the heat
in the heat of the night. 

In the heat
in the heat

No one understands in the heat of the night. 

No one understands in the heat of the night.
