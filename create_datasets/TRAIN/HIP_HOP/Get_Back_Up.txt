I'm only
I'm only human dog

Hello out there (I'm only human y'all)
Can you hear me? (I'm only human y'all)
It's an S.O.S. to let me be me (I'm only human y'all)

Aye, aye, aye listen to me
And when they push you down,
You got to get back up
And when they push you down,
You got to get back up
Push the dirt off your jersey than go for the cup
Or the trophy or the ring, champion no matter what
Cause when you got the belt and the ring
People with ya poppin' bottles, taking pictures look around
But soon as you fall down all the haters pass a judgment
Fly's I'm is shorty, I'm about to pour this

Aye, what it is world
Yeah it's me again, back before you, at your mercy
Don't bend your knee again, no running from the truth
As much as we pretend, 
That it ain't what it is, than it hits C.N.N.
Apologies to my fans and my closest friends, (I'm sorry)
For letting you down, I wont take you down this road again
Most of you now saying whatever, here we go again
Blogs, radio, and television all going in
I laugh to keep from crying through all of the embarrassment
I gotta say you fucking haters is hilarious
How dare you sit right there and act as if you holier than thou'
Point your finger now 
With me looking down
Same clown that was twitpic'ing at my wedding
On the same twitter page disrespecting
Wait a second (hold up)
Never mind my imperfections this is fact, remember that
No mistakes too great to recover and bounce back

And when they push you down, 
You got to get back up
And when they push you down, 
You got to get back up

Push the dirt off your jersey than go for the cup
Or the trophy or the ring, champion no matter what
Cause when you got the belt and the ring
People with ya poppin' bottles, taking pictures look around
But soon as you fall down all the haters pass a judgment
Fly's I'm is shorty, I'm about to pour this

I admit, yeah, I done some dumb shit,
Disappointed everybody I know
Try not to hold that against me though
My road to redemption has no G.P.S.
So guess the time must be invested for this to be manifested
Yes it's hard living life in the spotlight
Trying to dodge the haters same time as the cop light
The bible say let he without sin cast the stone first (stone first)
The sinner or the one who judged him, who was wrong first?
Yeah he go to work, never done no drugs or to be fair
He just drink his liquor, touch his kids, beat his wife instead
Difference is, my shortcomings hit the media
Thanks to T.M.Z., the A.J.C. and Wikipedia
See the stairway to heaven while stepping down Jacob's ladder
My good outweigh the bad, God, ain't that what really matters, nope
A matter of fact I'm wrong but after that the good I've done in your hood
Should it overshadow that?
Got the world laughing at me for the moment
But it gonna be your turn 'fore it's over with
Even if you so legit that you get a house with a dog and a picket fence
The people with you then but when they turn on you remember this

And when they push you down, 
You got to get back up
And when they push you down, 
You got to get back up

Push the dirt off your jersey than go for the cup
Or the trophy or the ring, champion no matter what
Cause when you got the belt and the ring
People with ya poppin' bottles, taking pictures look around
But soon as you fall down all the haters pass a judgment
Fly's I'm is shorty, I'm about to pour this

Hello, out there
Can you hear me
Can you hear me
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Can you (hear you)
Hello, out there,
Can you hear me
You gotta get 
You gotta get
You gotta gotta believe in me
Hey
Hello out there 
Can you hear me? 
It's an S.O.S. to let me be me 

I accept full responsibility 
For the all the wrong I've done
If y'all thought I were perfect
I apologize for being human man
But never again partner
You can put my life on that

And when they push you down,
You got to get back up
And when they push you down,
You got to get back up
Push the dirt off your jersey than go for the cup
Or the trophy or the ring, champion no matter what
Cause when you got the belt and the ring
People with ya poppin' bottles, taking pictures look around
But soon as you fall down all the haters pass a judgment
Fly's I'm is shorty, I'm about to pour this

And you can love me, or you can leave me
Before you judge me, just let me be me
And you can love me or either leave me
Before you judge me, see life ain't easy
