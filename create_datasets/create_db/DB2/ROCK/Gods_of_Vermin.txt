Decay of mind comes gradually
It keeps creeping up my spine
Just a human's life deficiency

I am a god of vermin
I want to disappear
What reason can I find, what reason can I find?
Swallowing the things I can't control

What happens when they come and violate my inner sun?
What happens when they try to smother all behind their eyes?
Will I still justify those goddamn lies?
I had control

It grows inside
The brave divine
Inhale deny the stains inside

The angel comes inside
The words he silent sighs

What happens when they come and violate my inner sun?
What happens when they try to smother all behind their eyes?
Will I still justify those goddamn lies?
I had control

It grows inside
The brave divine
Inhale deny the stains inside
