Hey, Run it through a red light,
Twice the speed of sound,
Drive it on the white line,
Pull it in and out,

Grab the wheel and take a chance at luck,
We got the rythem, gonna tear it up,
And burn it after midnight,

You know what time it is?
It's time to get wild......

(Ohh - ohh - ohh)
It's getting dangerous, it's contagious,
(Ohh - ohh -ohh)
It's outragious, it's contagious,


Say (Hey) Walkin' on the high wire,
Over a net of flames,
Headin' for the wild life,
We're free to break the chains,


Well, Don't hesitate when the feelings right,
Forget about it shake and roll the dice,
And burn it after midnight,
