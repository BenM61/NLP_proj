Every time I try to play it safe
Holding back just a little part of me
I find myself forgetting what
I say that I believe
The promise of your word
Is all I need, its all I need
I'll lay my life down
And give it up
I'll give it up

I wanna be reckless
'Cause you are endless
I wanna be shameless
And shout your greatness
I will not be afraid
To surrender my way
And follow who you are
I wanna be reckless, reckless

I will lose my life
And just let go
Because I know this world is not my home
With fearless faith
I won't be moved
Unshakeable inside your truth
You laid your life down
And gave it up
So I'll give it up

I wanna be reckless
'Cause you are endless
I wanna be shameless
And shout your greatness
I will not be afraid
To surrender my way
And follow who you are
I wanna be reckless, reckless

I won't waste any more time
My life's Yours it is not mine
Use me Lord no matter what's at stake

I wanna be reckless
'Cause you are endless
I wanna be shameless
And shout your greatness
I will not be afraid
To surrender my way
And follow who you are
I wanna be reckless, reckless
For you, oh
For you, oh
For you, oh
For you, oh

I wanna be reckless
'Cause you are endless
I wanna be shameless
And shout your greatness
