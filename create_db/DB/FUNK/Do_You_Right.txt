Pa**in' the kind buds.
Kickin' back in the sand in the sun.
To be alive is lovin'.
Where the shore meets the sea.
Man I'm hummin' I'm hummin'

I'm free as I stare at the sea.
And I'm not comin' down.
The world is yours once you have found.
The good is to share.
Which is elsewhere.

The beauty of green is where light is now broken by what it touches. 
Remembering what you once had told me hit home.
And hasn't it always been so.

[Chorus]
I'm free as I stare at the sea.
And I'm not comin' down.
The world is yours once you have found.
The good is to share.
Which is elsewhere.

Like I said before I'll say it once more.
Knew you would make me feel so good.
Wanna do you right.
Can't get enough.

This is the stuff
Life's about and it trips me out.
Wanna do you right.

Bright mornings, days when I want so much.
I want nothing, just this life and no more.
I'll come within this world
There's only one for me.
She's waiting, I'll soon come.

[Chorus]

Free from the burn the burn that helps spite and 
Free from the burn now baby dib your price 
No buzz hack, no buzz hack 
No buzz hack, no buzz hack 

Swing the thing you bring check it out 
How could you be so good to me 
How could you be so good to me I want to be worth I want to be worth 
Buzz hack hack hack buzz 

Yea swing to the thing you bring 
Check it out 
Like I said before I'll say it once more. 
Knew you would make me feel so good. 

Wanna do you right. 
Can't get enough. 
This is the stuff life's about and it trips me out. 
Wanna do you right.
