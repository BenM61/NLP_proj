It's been so long since I touched your face
It's been so long since I had the taste
It's been so long since I had you here with me
It's been so long since I yesterdays
It's been so long since you get away
It's been so long I never thought I would have seen you again

So that's why, girl I don't want to let you go
That's why, feeling starts let you know
That's why, baby girl don't tell me no
Why don't we try our love again?
So that's why, you're the woman I should be with
That's why, miss you more than a little bit
That's why, think I have had enough of this
Why don't we try our love again?

It's been so long has been quite a while
It's been so long since I seen that smile
It's been so long since I had you close to me
It's been so long so much has changed
It's been so long girl I take the blame
It's been so long but I knew someday I'll see you again

I used to have you here with me
I think about you constantly
And I just had to let you know
Can't remember why I let you go
But here we got us a second chance
The answers are our true romance
And we don't have to be alone
It's time for you to come on home
