I write down
Everything that you say
So I don't get lonely
When you are away
 
I've got a book of love
 
If you should
Ever happen to leave
I'll add your book to my
Lovelorn library
 
I've got a book of love
 
I know you'd never try
To leave me
'Cause I've got a chain
Around your heart
And you'll never be free
 
I've got a book of love
