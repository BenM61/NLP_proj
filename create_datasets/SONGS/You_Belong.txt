I'll take the high road if you ask too 
Or buy a pretty house with a naked view 
Of the lakeside where we're all alone 
Where we can make a life of our very own 
You'll be my lifetime hero 
I'll be the girl of your dreams 
I'll sew our lives at the seams 
'Cause I know that... 

You belong right here next to me 
You belong right here endlessly 
I' won't ever let you down 
You won't shead a tear 
'Cause you belong right here, 
Right here with me 

I can serve you breakfast on the store 
You can kiss me there like you did before 
So many lifetimes long ago 
We rest assured cause we truly know 
That you are my lifetime hero 
And I am the girl of your dreams 
And we'll sew our lives at the seams 
'Cause I know that...
