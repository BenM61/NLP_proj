It is a bad time to be poor,
'Cause we don't give a shit no more.
If you want to go for help, don't look next door.
The line's been drawn and staked outside.

I see to trying to lay the blame
On the folks in charge who hide in shame
For growing up with an open purse,
And learning not about being alive.

Haven't I done enough to burn out?
Haven't I been there to help out?

It is a bad time to be young.
What's left to us can't be undone
Without it riding on our backs
When young and poor go hand in hand.

It is a bad time to be poor,
And feeling winter through a crack in the door.
