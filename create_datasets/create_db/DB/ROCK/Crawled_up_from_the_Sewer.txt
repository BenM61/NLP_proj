I Crawled up from the Sewer in a Quest to Eat Your Brain
Manhole for a Cranium I Bathe in Toilet Rain
Burning Red Desire Eating Out my Insides
My Jellifed Skin Stinking up the Night

Hiding from the World Until It's Time to Feed
Emerging From the Darkness Human Flesh I Need
Buglamp Eyes Aglaze Veins Pulsate with Muck
Carnivoric Frenzy Bone Marrow I Suck

Ground Up Powdered Rats Fly up My Nose
Tail in the Rail Savor Pulverized Toes
Eyes water Head Pounds Ready Up for Grub
Thinking Stinking Sewage Drinking Drown In Filthy Crud
