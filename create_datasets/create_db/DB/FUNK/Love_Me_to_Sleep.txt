Long nights
Those everything wrong nights -
I used to lie awake and play for morning to come
It sees like years before my tears dried in the sun
'cause you had gone.
So love me to sleep tonight
Kiss away the pain of all those mem'ries one by one
And show me the river still runs strong and deep
Tonight my love - love me to sleep.
Slow now
We can't let it go now
Here in my arms you've got a perfect place to hide
If you've got doubts why don't we let the night decide
Just let it ride.
And love me to sleep tonight
Kiss away the pain of all those mem'ries one by one
. . .
Love me to sleep tonight
Kiss away the pain of all those mem'ries one by one
. . .
Tonight my love - love me to sleep.
