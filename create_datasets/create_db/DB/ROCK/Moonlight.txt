Enter the night as the day fades away
Feel it's dark embrace
Your all alone except a million stars in space
As you walk lost and astray

The man in the moon stares with a ghastly grin
With cold eyes that cannot see
Is it the echo of your footsteps that you hear
Or is it someone there?

Shadows at night
Dance the walls when your out of sight
Creep up from behind
When you walk in the moonlight

I'm the one in from behind
I'm your shadow in the night
I am the dark side of you
Where you are I am too
Wherever you go I follow you
When you walk in the pale moonlight
