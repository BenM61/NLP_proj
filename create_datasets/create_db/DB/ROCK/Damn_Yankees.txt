Hey brother
Ready for another
Dose of my Yankee pride
In the jungle
Ya just might stumble
Onto something that you never tried

Got that right

There was trouble in the east
Worry in the west
Till the wall came tumblin' down
Shift in the sand
Rockets to the madman
Haven't heard a sound

You don't have to worry
Help is on the way
We don't need no "thank you, ma'am"
We know what they're gonna say

(they say) hey, hey, damn Yankee
Woh, oh, oh, damn Yankee

(how we doin')

Now I say what I want 
And I do what I want
And I go where I want to go
Ain't no strong man
Safe from the hang man
Baby, now, don't ya know

If you need assistance
I'll be on the way
Run into a little resistance
Ya know what they're gonna say

(they say) hey, hey, damn Yankee
Woh, oh, oh, damn Yankee
Hey, hey, damn Yankee

They landed at Plymouth rock
The kids was ready to roll
Greasy dictator down south of us 
Lost all control 
He didn't have time to see me
He didn't have time to thank me
Suck on the barrel of my hot shotgun
Smile when you say "damn Yankee"

Hey, hey, damn Yankee
Woh, oh, oh, damn Yankee
Hey, hey, damn Yankee
Woh, oh, oh, damn Yankee

Damn Yankee
Damn Yankee
