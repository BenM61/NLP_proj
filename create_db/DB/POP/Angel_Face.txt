Are you ready for the rest of your life
Does your comforter provide
Are you ready to remain evermore in your world of ice
All your feelings all locked inside

Are you a woman or just a mannequin
Does your heart beat like the rest
Do you ever feel like joining in with the human race
Or are you happier outside?

But now you're gone you've broke the spell
I've got no memories just a photograph
I've got the best there is of you
You're just a devil with a pretty angel face

You've made your choice and that's ok
It never would have worked out anyway
I've got the best there is of you
You're just a devil with a pretty angel face

Will you be ready in your later life
When your looks are on the wane
and you're thinking of the ones and the scores
that you left behind
As they come to haunt your mind
And when the twilight moment comes at last
and you have to face that nobody's there to care

But now you're gone you've broke the spell
I've got no memories just a photograph
I've got the best there is of you
You're just a devil with a pretty angel face

You've made your choice and that's ok
It never would have worked out anyway
I've got the best there is of you
You're just a devil with a pretty angel face

Pretty angel face
