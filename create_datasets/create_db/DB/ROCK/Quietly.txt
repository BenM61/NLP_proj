Quitely explodes your love
Your insecurity is so soft to me
I can't let you bleeding
We are falling into us
I see you dyin' in my eyes

Just let it all go
you left
so am I

we go insane

Just let it all go
you left
so am I

you leave on inside

Quietly we arrive
Your insecurity is so soft to you
You can't let me bleeding
We are falling into deep
I'm dying in your open mouth

Just let it all go
you left
so am I

we go insane

Just let it all go
you left
so am I

you leave on
you leave on inside

So you care
leave them on
So you care
leave them on with a shine
and you can't go on with your life
it's a fact we can't deny

If you have to go, please go quiet
Please go quietly

Just let it all go
you left
so am I

we go insane

Just let it all go
you left
so am I

you leave on
you leave on inside

let it all go
