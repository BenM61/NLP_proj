First I saw her face In school
I remember I was a fool
Now I'm longing for her today
But she'll never come my way oh-baby

I travel around the world
I'm looking for something
But I'll never forget This girl

Sometimes I'm In the underworld
then again I spread my wings
And I cannot forget this (girl)

I search for her in every magazine
I heard she became a beauty queen
Pictures in my head of yesterday
Make me feel she was o.k. - my baby

And baby if you can
Please let me be your man

I was just afraid she might say "no"
I was just so mad to let her go
I want a chance and then I'd say
"Let's settle down come on please stay, oh baby please"
