Built a house of cards around your heart 
Show yourself to no one 
Wear a mask 
Didn't think you'd tear it all apart 
Didn't know you had the nerve for that 
Every bit of trouble that I've cherished 
Every bit of truth that I let perish 
Every little bit of me is naked 
I am naked now 
I am naked now 
I am naked now 
Yeah 

Close your eyes and wonder why it's dark 
Built a house of cards around your heart 
Act surprised when you keep fallin' down 
Something about you is like a spark 
Didn't think you'd tear it all apart 

Yeah you burn all other life down to the ground 
Every bit of time that I have wasted 
Every bit of truth I never tasted 
Every little bit of me is naked 
I am naked now 
I am naked now 
I am naked now 

Every bit of trouble that I've cherished 
Every bit of truth that I let perish 
Every little bit of me is naked 
I am naked now 
I am naked now 
I am naked now 
I am naked now 
I am naked now 
Naked now 
Now 
Naked now 
Now 
I am naked now
