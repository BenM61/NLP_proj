Get down

Disco Baby.
Ever see a room start arockin'
Ever see the ceilin' fall?
Ever sge a dance floor burnin'
Up from wall to wall?
Disco Baby
Disco Baby.
When she grooves
She makes the moves
That drive you crazy.
That's my Disco Baby
Freakin' out the discothek.

When they play a real bad record
And the beat is really cool
Ev'rybody claps their hands
And watches you know who.
Disco Baby
