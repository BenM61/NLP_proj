Oh, he's a moody old man. 
Song of summer in his hand. 
Ooh, he's a moody old man. 
In, in, in his hand. 
In his hand.

Delius, 
Delius amat. 
Syphilus, 
Deus,
Genius, oh.

To be sung of a summer night on the water. 
Oh, on the water.

"Ta, ta-ta! 
Ta, ta-ta! 
In be, Fenby!"

To be sung of a summer night on the water 
Oh, on the water. 
On the water.
