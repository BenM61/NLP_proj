I'm just tryna try
When haters do what they do and steady hidin' the lie
Laughing while we, ridin' and high
'Cause we know that they ladies will let us slide in their pie
Yeah, they call us nook nook crooks
'Cause all they hear from the room is babadook-dook-dook
Yeah, you think I make rooks book?
Well my singin' partner 'bout to murder before he do the hook, look

Starting from nothing, I did it
Y'all mad 'cause you didn't
Y'all mad 'cause y'all ain't in it
Y'all mad 'cause I got the master plan, cash got no limit
I might ride to your block and let this drop when I finish
Uh, yeah, put that on your head
People thought we was recording 'cause the dot shot red
I just do this for my homies 'till the block get fed
I rap slow so you understand what the f*ck I said
But
Ok I'm still on my grind, holding minds down with it
I'm keepin' my side
Open ya third eye
They thinking you're blind
Strap to the back, with a Mac' in a backpack
Homies' strapped, and ready to ride
Feeling like Biggie, I'm Ready To Die

So get off me
Bitch, get off me
I just don't got no time for all these bitches and your soft way
So get off me
Bitch, get off me
I just don't got no time for all you bitches and your soft way

Whoever said Tech Nina ain't the shizzy is a busta deluxe with cheese
My foot is ready to touch ya and scuff the 3's
You couldn't move 'em with a Mustard beat plus with Yeez
'Cause you's a sorry mother-sucker, I'll buck ya then puff the trees
I'm for real
Do I kill her, certainly so
Your lady say she don't 'member ever squirting before
Till she had this player in the middle of the west, a flirtin' negro
I'll knock her way down the coach from her burkin' ego
Ya heard it?! (I heard it!)
Let's give it up for the KC King
But I never wanna get up in the race, we sing
When I get up on a beat, I'ma bake these schemes
Look at the Nina
I'm comin' at you with a team of cleaners
Rippin' and packin' the reamers
Thinkin' he better then he be the dreamer

So get off me
Bitch, get off me
I just don't got no time for all these bitches and your soft way
So get off me
Bitch, get off me
I just don't got no time for all you bitches and your soft way

Bitches ain't shit and ain't never gon' be shit
Talk like a asshole, baby girl eat shit
Chach on this thief shit
Dog off the leash shit
Get yo BMF
Yeah I'm on that leach shit (what)
Money everywhere, nigga disrespect mine and we gunnin' everywhere
Pussy's gettin' no love motherfuck a (February)
Cracked my enemy's girl then I fucked her everywhere
Yeah I'm all up in these streets and you suckas never there
80's baby and I grew up wish cluckas everywhere
F*ck that mad doggin' got a shot for every stare
If you wanna see fake take a look up in the mirror

So get off me
Bitch, get off me
I just don't got no time for all these bitches and your soft way
So get off me
Bitch, get off me
I just don't got no time for all you bitches and your soft way

Clown Town!
Clown Town!
