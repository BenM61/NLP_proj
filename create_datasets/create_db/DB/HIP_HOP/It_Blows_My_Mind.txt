(It blows my mind)

Blowing chronic to me, it's like a tradition to me
I got the pi-doun, so sit down and listen to me
Don't go against me fool, go wit me
We could blow it all together like Bobby Brown and Whitney

Yeah, we got something in common
They could search a nigga, but they never finding my bomb
And I got the stash, spot my cash
Got lot of motherfuckas pulling police shots

I'm not The One, nigga you could call me The Two
Bob Marley reincarnated, pupils dilated
Emancipated, concentrated, debated, rated many times
You surprised how I made it, huh?

You hate it, huh, but you know I ain't even trippin'
I'm splitting that Swisha up, plotting on the come up
I'm living my life and never putting my gun up
Drinking my drink, and I'ma smoke that blunt

The chronic's blowing
The chronic's blowing
The chronic's blowing
The chronic's blowing
(It blows my mind)

The greener the tree, the better the bud
The strength of the branch, will tell you how chronic it was
I'm buzzing high, sliding, slippin'
Gotcha listening to Snoop and now you feel like you crippin'

It's all to the good, the dash is wood
You got some hoes in ya truck and now ya ready to f*ck
But, they frontin' and fakin' and time is wastin'
She don't wanna give ya number now she howlin' at Jason

Now don't get mad, just roll to the pad
And keep a G on the bitch and roll another dub bag
(My nigga)
Light that shit, hit that bitch
Then past it to ya homie like playa, pimp
(Blaze that bitch)

And when you get dizzone, crack the do'
And let me get a little snizzle
Cause ain't no fun, if the homies can't get none
Puff, puff, pass my nigga, one lizza

The chronic's blowing

It's the diabolical, chronical, mythological
Psychological, make a model hoe, f*ck a G
Pre-medical, steady slow those, ready can get it
Teacher taught it to those inside with mind apparatus

My status has been the baddest ever since I intro'd
I'm that nigga that brought y'all the info
On the Chucks, French braids and endo
Big Snoop Dogg with the fog on the window

Spell ya name in it, put ya face in it
And hang with the nigga with the gang bang spinach
Drag it, blunt wrap it or zig zag it
Don't really matter even if it's in the package

Put it to the side, so when ya boy hit the eastside
I'm look for the firefied G-5
Aiyyo Pharrell, gimme that VA discount
I'm tryna bounce wit the whole ounce
(Smoke me out)

The chronic's blowing

Come and keep me company
Baby come and f*ck with me
