Lately
I find myself out gazing at stars
Hearing guitars
Like someone in love

Sometimes the things I do astound me
Mostly whenever you're around me

Lately
I seem to walk as though I have wings
Bump into things
Like someone in love
Each time I look at you I'm limp as a glove
And feeling like someone in love
