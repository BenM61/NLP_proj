When the temperature dips
I'm in my baby's arms
His tender fingertips
Know just how to keep me warm
It may be zero degrees
With the snow falling down
I've got warm and tender love
Just as long as he's around

It may be winter outside
But in my heart it's spring
How much joy and pleasure baby
Can one guy bring

Winter nights can be awful cold
Without someone to hold
But when I have you next to me
Baby, I'm in ecstasy

It may be winter outside
But in my heart it's spring
How much joy and pleasure baby
Can one guy bring

Throughout my life
I've had my share of guys
But he's been the only one
Who can make my temperature rise
Things are just not the same
When he's not by my side
But yet I shouldn't complain
But be waiting with my arms open wide

It may be winter outside
But in my heart it's spring
How much joy and pleasure baby
Can one guy bring

It may be winter outside
But in my heart it's spring
How much joy and pleasure baby
Can one guy bring

It may be winter outside
But in my heart it's spring
How much joy and pleasure baby
Can one guy bring
