We shall kill, we shall kill, we shall kill, we shall kill

Rise god of violence in immortal majesty
The forces of separatists to arms
Malicious titans and the fear their words can breed 
The one commandment echoes forth as clouds of drones attack

We shall kill, we shall kill, we shall kill, we shall kill

Rise of usurpers, indestructible regimes
And in times of war destroyers of hope
Kings of the earth inject the core of the doctrine
Conflict yield to degradate the strongest minds of all

We shall kill, all as one
We shall kill, these battles can be won
We shall kill until we die

As the gods of violence
Gods of violence
Gods of violence come alive

We shall kill, all as one
We shall kill, these battles can be won
We shall kill until we die

As the gods of violence
Gods of violence
Gods of violence come alive

Dehumanizing killing spree, supported by technology
Women, children everyone will die
Praying there must come a day, the spark of peace enflames again
Heaven through the world into their lives
Protectors of the masterplan, waken darker sides of men 
Instigate the war for all to see
Collateral damage in their name posse of luciferian 
Commanders of satanic liberty liberty

We shall kill, we shall kill, we shall kill, we shall kill
We shall kill, we shall kill, we shall kill, we shall kill
We shall kill, all as one
We shall kill, these battles can be won
We shall kill until we die

As the gods of violence
Gods of violence
Gods of violence come alive
