Go on, show me your ace of spades
I'll let you win again
Just to fall
No dice, this is real life we live
And I choose to fake it now and then
But I'm not alright
Not at all, 'cause

I act so bulletproof
But you take me down
You take me down
Gave all I got to you
Now I'm standing my ground
Standing my ground

I'm no house of cards, house of cards
Not caving into you, not caving into you
I'm no house of cards, house of cards
Not for you, oh

Not caving into you

Your voice smothered in lies for me
I told you you were king
Just to fall
I hold the fucking world on my head
Just to keep it out your hands
I won't let it fall
Not at all

I act so bulletproof
But you take me down
You take me down
Gave all I got to you
Now I'm standing my ground
Standing my ground

I'm no house of cards, house of cards
I'm no house of cards, house of cards, no
I'm no house of cards, house of cards
Not caving into you

I'm no house of cards, house of cards
Not caving into you, not caving into you
I'm no house of cards, house of cards
Not for you, oh
