Like a flower waiting to bloom
like a light bulb in a dark room
I am sitting here waiting for you to come home and turn me on
like the desert waiting for rain
like a school kid waiting for spring
I am sitting here waiting for you to come back home and turn me on
My poor heart, it's been so dark
since you've been gone
after all you're the one who turned me off
now you're the only one that can turn me back on
uh
my hi-fi's waiting for a new tune
and my glass is waiting for some fresh ice-cubes
I'm just sitting here waiting for you to come on
back home and turn me on.
