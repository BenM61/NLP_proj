Woo, gave you my money, I gave you my time
Why you want to hurt me, girl
Are you serious, I'm just curious
Why you want to hurt me, girl

Just because you're not for real
Why you hurt me, girl
Just because you're not for real
Why you hurt me, girl

Never, ever had a lover
Who put the peddle to the metal
And burn rubber on me, Charlie
Oh, no

You took my money, you took my time
Made me think everything was fine
Then you upped and ran away
And made me just go crazy

I never, ever had a lover
Who put the peddle to the metal
And burn rubber on me, Charlie
Oh, no, no, no

Just because you're not for real
Why you hurt me, girl
Just because you're not for real
Why you hurt me, girl

I never, ever had a lover
Who put the peddle to the metal
And burn rubber on me, Charlie
Oh, no, no, no

Just because you're not for real
Why you hurt me, girl
Just because you're not for real
Why you hurt me, girl

You told me to go up the block
To get you a strawberry pop
When I got back to the flat
You had burned rubber out the back

I went to the closet and saw no clothes
All I saw was hangers and poles
I went to the phone and called your mother
And told me that you had burned rubber on me, Charlie
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Just because you're not for real
Why you hurt me, girl
Just because you're not for real
Why you hurt me, girl

I never, ever had a lover
Who put the peddle to the metal
And burn rubber on me, Charlie
Oh, no, no, no, no, oh, no, yeah, yeah

Just because you're not for real
Why you hurt me, girl
Just because you're not for real
Why you hurt me, girl

Just because you're not for real
Why you hurt me, girl

You took my money, you took my time
You made me think everything was fine
Like the clock on the wall said ding-ding-dong
Got to find another lover that won't be gone

She won't put the medal to the metal
And burn rubber, burn rubber on me, Charlie
No, no, no, no

Never, ever had a lover
Who put the peddle to the metal
And burn rubber on me, Charlie
No, no, no, no, no, no
Never, ever had a lover
Who put the peddle to the metal
And burn rubber on me, Charlie
No, no, no, no, no, no
Never, ever had a lover
Who put the peddle to the metal
And burn rubber on me, Charlie
No, no, no, no, no, no
Never, ever had a lover
Who put the peddle to the metal
And burn rubber on me, Charlie
No, no, no, no, no, no
Never, ever had a lover
Who put the peddle to the metal
And burn rubber on me, Charlie
No, no, no, no, no, no
Never, ever had a lover
Who put the peddle to the metal
And burn rubber on me, Charlie
No, no, no, no, no, no
Never, ever had a lover
Who put the peddle to the metal
And burn rubber on me, Charlie
No, no, no, no, no, no
Never, ever had a lover
Who put the peddle to the metal
And burn rubber on me, Charlie
No, no, no, no, no, no
