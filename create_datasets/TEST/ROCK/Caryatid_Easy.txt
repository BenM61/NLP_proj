And I remember one faded summer
And I remember the curtain call
Waiting outside, watching the time fly

Way you roll the dice
Leaves my eyes
There is no way to hide
You live inside my mind
You play
A caryatid  easy
Leaves my eyes
A caryatid  easy
Way you roll the dice, the dice

Walking in line
With this life's shadow
The spot line's surprise
Are guarding from gallows

Solid stone wall
Wouldn't turn back the time at all

There is no compromise
Now all the names are called
Senses summoned to realize
They live inside my mind
They play

Consumed by this crowd scene
Breaking out this dislocated dream

Educated
With poison laughter
Seems like high times
Every morning after

Waiting outside
Watching the time fly

Way you roll the dice
Leaves my eyes
There is no way to hide
You live inside
My mind
You play
