[G.O.D]
We got hits for years, I got a bitch for every day of the year
We got chips, ice with glocks and clips
Push the hottest whips and shit we came from the bottomless pit
Now we reign on the top of the shit
[GAMBINO]
Foul things in my past that I'll never forget
Would I last, will I die young I never gave up
Now we up
[TY KNITTY]
In the class for delf, the most felt stay to ourself
We playing with the cards that was dealt like
First time I seen a man get killed that shit was mad real
Damn that was my brother
[G.O.D]

So we foreverly shine, now we vow to divide pie
