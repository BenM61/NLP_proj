Take the long road
Past the city
To the last sign
When you go

Wind your way down
Down the canyon
To find the lost sign
Past the road

Driving
We can take you there
Please don't follow

But Leave a light on
Leave a light on
To light your way home
If you go

For there are secrets
That you can't know
On the last sign
Past the road

Driving
We can take you there
Please don't follow

Driving over bridges

Driving
