Oh baby you see the light
Please show me the way to go
Night time is so far away
Oh baby believe in me

I want to love oh baby see the light
I want to love please show me the way to go
I really want to love night time is so far away
I want to love oh baby believe in me

In the day
I just can't concentrate
On Anything
At all

Yes my mind
It just slips away
To the night time
With you

Yes my mind
It just slips away
To the night time
With you
