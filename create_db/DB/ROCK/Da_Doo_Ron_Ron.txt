I met her on a Monday and my heart stood still
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron ron
Someboy told me that her name was Jill
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron ron

   Yes, my heart stood still
   Yes, her name was Jill
   And when I walked her home
   da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron ron

I knew what she was thinkin' when she caught my eye
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron ron
I looked so quiet but my oh my
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron ron

   Yes, she caught my eye
   Yes, but my oh my
   And when I walked her home
   da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron ron

Well, I picked her up at seven and she looked so fine
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron ron
Someday soon I'm gonna make her mine
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron ron

   Yes, he looked so fine
   Yes, I'll make her mine
   And when I walked her home
   da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron ron
   Yeah, yeah, yeah
   da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron ron
