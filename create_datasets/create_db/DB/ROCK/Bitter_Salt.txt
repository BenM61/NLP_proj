Hang around on the weekends, darling
While we figure it out
Many leave on the Sunday morning
'Cause I like tough and we break up
It's on, it's on

Never mind what you said last week, babe
I forgive what you've done
You come back on a Sunday evening
We go out, we lay in the dark
It's on, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on

It's getting old and it's all your fault
Because I won't do what I'm told
It's makes my mind meet bitter salt
It's on, it's on

Shall we go to the pictures, darling
Shall we go see what's on
Just to argue about everything
'Cause when we're out, you and me shout
It's on, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on

It's getting old and it's all your fault
Because I won't do what I'm told
It's makes my mind meet bitter salt
It's on
It's on, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on

It's getting to know that it's all your fault
Because I won't do what I'm told
It's makes my mind meet bitter salt
It's on, it's on, it's on

It's on, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on
