(Now you've gone now you've gone)
Since you've gone the moon the sun the stars in the sky
Know the reason why I cry
Love divine once was mine now you've gone

Since you've gone my heart my lips my tear dimmed eyes
A lonely soul within me cries
I acted smart broke your heart now you've gone
Oh what I'd give for the lifetime I've wasted
The love that I've tasted I was wrong now you've wrong
(Now you've gone now you've gone
Since you've gone my heart
(Now you've gone) now you've gone
