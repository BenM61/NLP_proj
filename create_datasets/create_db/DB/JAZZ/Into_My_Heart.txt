You don't hear me
So I holler
You don't see me
As I stand before you

You don't touch me
When I'm lying naked
But I won't forget you
'Cause I've carved your name

Into my heart
And into my skin
But you won't let me in
Into my head

The words that you said
But you won't let me in
(but you won't let me in)
You're not my leader

So why do I chase you
I don't need your approval
So why do I face you
I keep on hurting

But I can't erase you
And I dial your number
Again and again
'Cause you're into my heart

And under my skin
But you won't let me in
Into your head
Where I have been (dead?)

But you won't let me in
Into your heart
And under your skin
But you won't let me in

You're into my heart
And under my skin
But you won't let me in
Into your heart

And under your skin
But you won't let me in
If you're not near me
I am hollow

You don't hear me
As I scream before you
You don't touch me
I am broken

But I can't forget you
Your name's engraved

But I can't forget you
Your name's engraved

Into my heart
And under my skin
But you won't let me in
Into your heart

And under your skin
But you won't let me in
Into my heart
And under my skin
But you won't let me in
