Once we sailed across the seas
Yet some doubts tainted winds blew
Once our tale you believed in
Yet these doubts have drowned your soul

Man plans and god laughs
This is what I've learnt from you
Once we stood just like two halves
Yet these doubts have drowned your soul

I wonder will we be
Up to the legend once we heard
I wonder if we will see
Each other flying as two halcyon birds

For a while, I thought you were lost
In the depths where lovers meet
One last smile and fingers crossed
Is how you left the lovers seat

I wonder will we be
Up to the legend once we heard
I wonder if we will see
Each other flying as two halcyon birds

I've tried to make them burn and let them all fade away
Yet these memories remain, stuck in my bones and my brain
I've tried to make them burn and let them all fade away
Yet these memories remain, stuck in my bones and my brain

I wonder will we be
Up to the legend once we heard
I wonder if we will see
Each other flying as two halcyon birds
