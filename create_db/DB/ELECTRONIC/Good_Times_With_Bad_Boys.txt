You're gonna see some changes in me
From now on I have a heart of stone
I'm not the girl I used to be
I'm going out into the danger zone

And I don't mind what people may say
Should I care what they think of me?
I'm looking out for a different way
I'm cuttin' loose, runnin' wild and free

Know what I want, know where to go
No one can stop me, no
Whoa, whoa

Good times with bad, bad boys
They live it up and get down easy
Good times with bad, bad boys
That's what I want, that's what I'm needin'

Don't need their love, I want to be free
I'm not a toy that anyone can own
They take it all so seriously
I'm going out into the great unknown

You only live once, that's what they say
No one can stop me, no
Whoa, whoa

Good times with bad, bad boys
They live it up and get down easy
Good times with bad, bad boys
That's what I want, that's what I'm needin'

Good times with bad, bad boys
Just havin' fun, fast and easy
Good times with bad, bad boys
Know what it takes, know how to please me

Know what I want, know where to go
You'll never stop me, no
Whoa, whoa

Good times with bad, bad boys
They live it up and get down easy
Good times with bad, bad boys
That's what I want, that's what I'm needin'
Good times with bad, bad boys
They live it up and get down easy
Good times with bad, bad boys
That's what I want, that's what I'm needin'
Good times with bad, bad boys

They live it up and get down easy
Good times with bad, bad boys
That's what I want, that's what I'm needin'
