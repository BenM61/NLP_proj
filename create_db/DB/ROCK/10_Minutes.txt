Ten minutes to downtown
Is ten minutes too far?
When my friends all say I'm crazy
Maybe I'm being selfish
Maybe I'm just scared

Don't be gone when I get home, I need you there

If I had to explain it
I wouldn't know where to start
It's like you're falling in love while I just fall apart

Ten minutes to downtown
Is ten minutes too far?
When my heart is saying you're crazy
Maybe things are getting better
Maybe things aren't so bad

Don't be gone when I get home, you're all I have

If I had to explain it
I wouldn't know where to start
It's like you're falling in love while I just fall apart

Pockets empty
How can you tell me that everything will work out?
A pointless fight 
When you're always right and everything will work out
It works out

Sometimes I miss you more
Whenever I'm at home
I've been home all summer
Now I'm leaving you alone

Pockets empty
How can you tell me that everything will work out?
A pointless fight 
When you're always right and everything will work out
Everything will work out
Everything will work out
