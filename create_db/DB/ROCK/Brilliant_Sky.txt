Nothing has changed I'm exactly the same
As before we went cruising in a high speed lane
I'm still dreaming of open sky open road

The grass is not greener on the other side
I know by now, 'cause I walked the red carped and died
There is so much more to life than what meets the eye

We're running wild on the ocean
Running wild

Brilliant sky all over
There's a brilliant sky all over these days

And I thought I was safe on this one-way crusade
But reality claimed my heart and my friends
Now this is day one in the rest of my life
And I'm feeling all grounded and my spirit is high

And I'm longing for open sky open road
We're running wild on the ocean
Running wild

There's a brilliant sky all over
There's a brilliant sky all over these days

Hang on
