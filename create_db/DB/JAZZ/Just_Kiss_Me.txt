No don't speak just kiss me
Just kiss me just kiss me
Please don't move just kiss me
Just kiss me and I'll know
You don't have to tell me of your desire
'Cause I'll never hear you while my heart's on fire
So don't explain kiss me
Just kiss me and I'll know
(To have and to hold you)
To have and to hold you
(It's so divine)
It's so divine
(Love fills me completely)
So completely
(When your lips meet mine)
Ah when your lips meet mine
So don't explain kiss me
Just kiss me and I'll know
(And I'll know)
