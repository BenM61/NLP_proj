Burn man, burn, burn it all
Chemical trips and I can face you
Chemical tricks and the bullshits gone

Burn man, burn, burn it all
Burn man, burn, burn it all

Suicide Jack, I can see you
I'm electric fix and you were gone
What you didn't know was only skin seep
Suicide Jack and you are gone

Burn man, burn, burn it all

The burning man
Burn man, burn, burn it all
