A little rain fallin', a little clock keep away the time
A little rain fallin', the little clock keep away the time
Well now, a little rain keep a-fallin', on this little love of mine

Little flowers bloomin', the little birds keep a-singin' tune
The little flowers bloomin', little birds keep-a singin' tune
I would like to love ya baby, underneath the shinin' moon
