Tell it face to face
You got you a race
Got no time to taste

If I went away
You could walk today

You're gonna kill some
You're gonna free some
You're gonna lose someone
You're gonna taste some
You're gonna want some
You're gonna be someone

Lines you're feedin' me
Don't make a mark of me
I don't bruise so easily

I tell it face to face
Got no time to taste
My memory's your fate

You're gonna kill some
You're gonna free some
You're gonna lose someone
You're gonna taste some
You're gonna want some
You're gonna believe someone

Send me alone
I'm solemn and sorry

I'm gonna need some
I'm gonna need some
You're gonna need someone
Did you believe some
You gotta breathe some
You're gonna free someone

Tell it face to face...
