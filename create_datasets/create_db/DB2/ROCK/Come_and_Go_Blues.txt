People say that you're no good
But I wouldn't cut you loose, baby, if I could
Well, I seem to stay down on the ground,
Baby, I'm too far gone to turn around
Oh, if only you would make up your mind,
Take me where you go, you're leaving me behind

Lord, you got those come and go blues,
Lord, you got those come and go blues,
Yes, you do, oh and you got me feelin' like a fool

Round 'n' 'round, 'round we go
Don't ask me why I stay here, I don't know
Well maybe I'm a fool to care
Without your sweet love, baby I would be nowhere
Here I'll stay, locked in your web,
'Till that day I might find somebody else
I don't know just when that would be,
I don't know, I can't say as I can't see

Woman, you got those come and go blues, yes you do
Lord, you got those come and go blues,
Yes, you do, oh and you got me feelin' like a fool
