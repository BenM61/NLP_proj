Fish fell out of water
Bird stuck on the ground
Chaos giving orders
Everything is upside down
Whole world's gonna fly by
I wonder where they'll go, oh
Trouble's on the outside, I know
So now, all I can think about is you

All I can think about is you
We fall in a wonderland
So low
A wonderland for you
I wanna walk into

It's all I can
It's all I can
It's all I can
It's all I can do
It's all I can do
All I can think about is you
It's all I can
All I can think about is you
It's all I can
All I can think about is you
Love is the only thing that is true
