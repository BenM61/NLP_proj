In 1925 she stole the show
But that was many, many years ago
Abandoned in a pile of useless junk
I found her never to be lost again
While I'm around her
I could ride forever in my old funky rolls
Just give me a bad hat and some old funky clothes
We don't care if folks are laughing
When we're on the road
Can't you feel that surge of power
Going 18 miles an hour
I could ride forever in my old funky rolls
She ain't even paid for but she's mine I suppose
Once they tried to repossess her
But she wouldn't start
God bless her
Spunky hunk a junk my funky rolls
For 30 years she got by on her looks
That was chic, that was very chic
Her face appeared in all the motor books

Once a week each and every week
When they checked her gasket out
The old girl blew it
Funky was a lemon
She never knew it
But I could ride forever in my old funky, my old funky rolls
She's got Plymouth headlights and
A tank full of holes
Once I thought I really lost her on Cid Boulevard
Funky found the love she needed
Metaphor, overheated
I could ride forever in my old funky, my old funky rolls
Just give me a bad hat and some old, old funky clothes
There goes the radiator
Break me up, I'll see you later
Spunky hunk a junk my funky
My funky rolls
Rickitick and teak my honey
Wackitack, hack, she's a honey
Funky hunk a junk
My funky rolls
Come on funky, will you please start?
Funky, I'll kick your ass
Funky, would you please start?
Funky, here comes the man from the finance company
That's a nice car
Nice, Funky
I'll see you later!
My funky, my funky rolls
