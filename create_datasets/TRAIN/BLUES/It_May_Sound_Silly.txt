It may sound silly for me to say this
After the way you broke my heart
But I still love you although we are apart

It may sound silly to say I miss you
I must confess that this is true
I want you only, 'cause no one else will do

The day we quarreled and you left me
Before you walked out through the door
I wanted to tell you how much I would miss you
But my pride wouldn't let me tell you so

It may sound silly but if you phone me
And ask forgiveness for doin' me wrong
It may sound silly but I'd be waiting with open arms

Oh yes it may sound silly but if you phone me
And ask forgiveness for doin' me wrong
It may sound silly but I'd be waiting with open arms
