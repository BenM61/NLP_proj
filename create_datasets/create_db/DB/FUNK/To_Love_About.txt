Yeah, baby, baby
I've been trying not to let my patience
Get the best of me when I feel weak
Always hoping for new conversation
But all I do is talk about you when I sleep

Having such a hard time getting over us
And the fact our love has flown away
The memory of your touch just ain't enough
To look forward and embrace another day

I wanna hear you say
I need your heart, I need your mind
I just can't live my life without
Your breathe, your kiss
Your smile, your lips to love about

It's been a long time since I held you near
Held your body gently close to me
The way you looked at me I miss the most
And now all I'm longing for is yesterday

I wanna hear you say
I need your heart, I need your mind
I just can't live my life without
Your breathe, your kiss
Your smile, your lips to love about

I can't live
(Incomprehensible)
Got to find a way

I wanna hear you say
I need your heart, I need your mind
I just can't live my life without
Your breathe, your kiss
Your smile, your lips to love about

I wanna hear you say
I need your heart, I need your mind
I just can't live my life without
Your breathe, your kiss
Your smile, your lips to love about

I wanna hear you say
I need your heart, I need your mind
I just can't live my life without
Your breathe, your kiss
Your smile, your lips to love about

Wanna hear you say
I need your heart, I need your mind
I just can't live my life without
Your breathe, your kiss
Your smile, your lips to love about

I wanna hear you say
I need your heart, I need your mind
I just can't live my life without
Your breathe, your kiss
Your smile, your lips to love about

I wanna hear you say
I need your heart, I need your mind
I just can't live my life without
Your breathe, your kiss
Your smile, your lips to love about

I can't live
(Incomprehensible)
Got to find a way
