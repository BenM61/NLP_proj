I used to sing to an empty room,
I was so lonely and so out of tune
Then you came along and
Made my life a happy song

It's a joy to have your love
Such a joy to feel your love
Ever set me free
Cause darlin' I can't be without you
Without you baby

I used to go to the show all alone
I sit through it two times
I couldn't go home
Then my darling you came along
And made my life a happy song

It's a joy to have your love
Such a joy to feel your love
Ever set me free
Cause darlin' I can't be without you
Without you baby

Then my darling you came along
And made my life a happy song

It's a joy to have your love
Such a joy to feel your love
Ever set me free
Cause darlin' I can't be without you
Without you baby
