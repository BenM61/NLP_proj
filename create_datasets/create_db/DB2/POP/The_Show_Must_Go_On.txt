Baby, although I chose this lonely life
It seems it's strangling me now
All the wild men with big cigars and gigantic cars
They're all laughing at me now
Oh I've been used, used
I've been taken for a fool, oh what a fool
I broke all the rules, rules, yeah
But I won't let the show go on

Baby, there's an enormous crowd of people
And they're all after my blood
I wish maybe they'd tear down the walls of this theater
And let me out, let me out
Oh, I've been so blind, yeah
I've wasted time, wasted, wasted oh so much time
Walking on the wire, high wire, yeah
But I won't let the show go on

I've been so blind, oh yes, I've been so blind
Wasted my time, wasted so much time
Walking on the wire, high wire, yeah
But I won't let the show go on

Baby, I wish you'd help me escape
And help me get away
Leave me outside my address
Far away from this masquerade
I've been so used, I've been so abused
I've been a fool, I broke all the rules
I've been so used oh and abused
But I won't let the show go
Ah, but I won't let the show
Ho, I won't let the show go on
