Suddenly I, am in front of the lights
Everything, I'm feeling
Scary and beautiful at the same time
And every day I try just to breathe 
I want to show the whole world
The truth inside of me

Suddenly people know my name
Suddenly everything has changed
Suddenly I feel so alive
In the blink of an eye

My dreams begin to rain
Suddenly time, feels like the wind
It changes everywhere I go 
I'm just trying to fit in
Now here I stand
And I'm still just that girl
I'm following my heart
In this amazing crazy world

Suddenly people know my name
Suddenly everything has changed
Suddenly I feel so alive
In the blink of an eye
Suddenly I am center stage
Suddenly I am not afraid
Suddenly I believe again
In a blink of an eye it's happening now

As my dreams begin to rain
I want to say to love me for me
What's inside
I'm gonna be positive, not run away, so much for you 
This is my life

Suddenly I am center stage
Suddenly I am not afraid
Suddenly I believe again
In the blink of an eye 
My dreams begin to reign
