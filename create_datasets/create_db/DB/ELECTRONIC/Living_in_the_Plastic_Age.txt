Every day my metal friend
Shakes my bed at 6am

Run in with my telephones

Talking fast I make a deal
Buy the fake and sell whats real
Whats this pain here in my chest
Maybe I should take a rest

They send the heart police to put you under, Cardiac arrest

Living in the
Living in the plastic age
Looking only half my age

I wish my skin could stand the pace

In the bed I read my mind
Remember how the mice were blind
I watch them fighting in their cage
Could this be the plastic age?

Plastic age
