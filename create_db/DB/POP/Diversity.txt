No trouble's ever gonna take anything away from me
No trouble's ever gonna take anything away from me

Sometimes you make me lie awake at night it doesn't work
Sometimes you make me wanna run away but I don't go
So I close my eyes and picture if I can flip my pillow
Dream a dream and put the stars back in the sky

Whoa whoa

No trouble's ever gonna take anything away from me
No trouble's ever gonna take anything away from me

Oh yeah yeah

No one is ever gonna take anything from me again
No one is ever gonna take anything from me again
No one is ever gonna take anything from me again
No one is ever gonna take anything from me again

Sometimes you make me lie awake at night it doesn't work
Sometimes you make me wanna run away but I don't go
So I close my eyes and picture if I can flip my pillow
Dream a dream and put the stars back in the sky

Whoa

No trouble's ever gonna take anything away from me
No trouble's ever gonna take anything away from me
No trouble's ever gonna take anything away from me
No trouble's ever gonna take anything away from me
No trouble's ever gonna take anything away from me
No trouble's ever gonna take anything away from me
No trouble's ever gonna take anything away from me
