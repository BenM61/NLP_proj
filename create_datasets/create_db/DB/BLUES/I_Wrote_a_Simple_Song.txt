I wrote a simple song
With simple words and harmony
Wasn't very long
Before a star, I was bound to be

I didn't care if it made the charts
I only wrote it for you and me
They think they're so smart now
They're not as smart as they want to be

They took my simple song, yes, they did
They changed the words and the melody
Made it all sound wrong, yeah
Now it sounds like a symphony

Who told them to mess with my
Oh, now, who gave them the right
I wanna know now
That song was personal

Because I wrote it for you
It's yours and mine, girl

I don't care if it
Makes the charts, y'all, no
I only wrote it for you and me

They think they're so smart
Yes, they do
They're not as smart
As they want to be

Who told them to mess with my
Oh, now, who gave them the right
I wanna know
That song was personal

Whoa, I wrote it for you
It's yours and mine

Yeah, yeah, oh, oh
