Take my eyes, take them aside
Take my face and desecrate
My arms and legs, they get in the way

Take my hands, they'll understand
Take my heart, pull it apart
And take my brains, they get in the way

'cause I've grown tired of this body
Cumbersome and heavy body

Take my lungs, take them and run
Take my tongue, go have some fun
And take the ears, take them and disappear

Take my joints, take them for points
Take my teeth, tear through my cheeks
And take the nose, take it and go dispose
Just go dispose, just go dispose

'cause I've grown tired of this body
Cumbersome and heavy body
I've grown tire of this body
Fall apart without me, body

Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Take my eyes, take them aside
Take my face and desecrate
Arms and legs get in the way
Bodies break

I've grown tired of this body
Cumbersome and heavy body
I've grown tire of this body
Fall apart without me, body

I've grown tire of this body
Cumbersome and heavy
Tired this body
Fall apart without me

Tired of this body
Tired of this body
