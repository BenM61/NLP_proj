I apologize to the streets, my bad (my bad)

Ya ready, look (yay yay yah)

It's back to the money (money), back to the block (block)
Back on the charts (charts), straight to the top (top)
Me I'm a hustla I can't stop won't stop
If I ain't on the route I'm in the one stop shop (yeah)
Everywhere I go they ask me 'Geezy where ya been?'
You ain't been looking hard enough I tell em look again (look again)
I hit the sit back, clock plan strategize
I look in the mirror and all I see is dollar signs (signs)
I can't lie, I had started to feel the recession
I signed my deal but I really wasn't feeling progression
But I'm a go getta, by all means I'm a get it
I'm a executer if I started then I'm a finish

You know you ain't seen me in so long

Cause I was getting back to the money, back to the money
Back to the money, back to the money
If you know about me
You know that I be in them streets, I can't sleep

Back to the money, back to the money (back to it)

[Verse 2: B.G.]

All on my money is getting back to the money (money)
Back to the cheese (cheese) back to the cheddar (cheddar)
Back to the green (green) and for that it's whatever (whatever)

Back to VL, where I sold my first rock (rock)
And it's uptown where I bust my first glock (blah, blah)
