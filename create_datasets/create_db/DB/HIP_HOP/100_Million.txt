Dis for da hood, Dis for da ghetto
Dis for all dem niggas gettin' dat money
Dat cash money, Dat 100 million dollar money
We got money
We da best

Ridin' big, gettin' mine
Two microwaves flip a brick at a time
Bandanna on da handle ready for da whip
When I wear da whitest soft watch it disappear
I disappear in da middle of da night
When I reappear bet da boss look so bright
Fo life, dough boy, More strikes, O boy
We ridin' low, Gettin' high
80 round drum let ya know da time
When you see da Maybachs nigga know its mine
Ridin' on da 2 4's runnin' ahead of my time
Watch runnin' from kind, anotha' one on my mind
Phone bill 4 grand get ya ho in da line
In da hood ho niggas act funny
Only real niggas really get to touch cash money

[Chorus]
I smell a lot of 100 million dollars, 100 million dollars, 100 million dollars
And I came from da ghetto (ghetto), and I came from da ghetto (ghetto)
If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up, If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up
If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up, If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up
If ya ghetto

Everyday a new whip hommie, So you know I gets my shine on
Flip after we flip hommie, So you know I gets my grind on
Birdman daddy, Pullin' up in dat brand new Cadi
Got money, livin' lavish, Got bitches, shippin' baggage
Move dem thangs, Get dem thangs, Switch dat lane
Get dat chains, Flip dem thangs, Get yo money hommie do yo thang
See I got em like 10 times, spend money got em like 10 times
Flip dat got em like 10 times, Got money like 10 more times nigga

[Chorus]

I'm from da ghetto, da bottoms, da hood, da slums
There's money out here, we just tryin' to get some
Cool like Dre nigga, A like K
When ya talk about me you better watch what ya say
Don't ever keep dem thangs where ya lay
Cuz dem pussy ass niggas show da folks where ya stay
Ya thought he was ya dawg, said he was a G
Sounds like anotha' code feeling to me
Niggas move sloppy and I really don't like it
F*ck around and get everybody indicted
Saw dis shit commin', you woulda thought I was a psychic
F**k around go dead broke tryin' to fight it

I, I, I all nighted, I every dayed it
And when it comes to my dues, I over payed it
Rated hood bitch, bitch I'm hood bitch
I ain't a asshole, but I'm on some hood shit
I wish I would switch, I don't know how
Blood gang swarm like a red ant pile
Mean mug, like I can't smile
Like my grill big, cost me a hundred thou'

[Chorus]

Cash Money Millionaires, 
Cash Money Billionaires, 
Cash Money Trillionaires
We rich, We ain't neva gone stop, Neva
We got money nigga
