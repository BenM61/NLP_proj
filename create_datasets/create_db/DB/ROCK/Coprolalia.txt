Feed me I got my head interstate
Got my head interstate when I'm alone
Give me a break, I've got to work up to hate
Only get out of bed when I'm alone
Give me a call, chest feeling small
It don't mean shit 'till I see it all
Got my head interstate
Head interstate
Head interstate
Got my head

Look I'm into staying in 'til
I get the gall to tell me that it's
Safe outside, a happy ending

Feed me another story that's true
Another story brand new I can't forget
Diagnosis around from a book that you found
And a pill you won't have me swallow yet
Suck me a line, anything to feel right
Only get out of bed if you'll turn out the light

Got my head interstate

Look I'm into staying in 'til
I get the gall to tell me that it's
Safe outside, a happy ending

Feet in the stall, juicing the call
Don't mean nothing 'til you feel it all
