Don't like the direction you are going to
Seems to lack the attention that it used to
You stay out all night and get high with your friends
Wonder why you don't get one thing done in the end
Don't like the direction you are going to

Don't like the direction you have come to
Now it has the attention that it used to
Stay home all night with the tv and wife
Comfortable life ain't all it's cracked up to be
Don't like the direction you have come to

And it's easy to get caught
And the weight of the world
It's falling on your face
So unsure that you would

Don't like the direction you are going to
Seems to lack the attention that it used to
You stay out all night and get high with your friends
Wonder why you don't get one thing done in the end
Don't like the direction you are going to

And it's easy to get caught
And the weight of the world
It's falling on your face
So unsure that you would

Don't like the direction you are going to
Seems to lack the attention that it used to
You stay out all night and get high with your friends
Wonder why you don't get one thing done in the end
Don't like the direction you are going to
