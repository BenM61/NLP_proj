So there it is
All the truth is on the table
Nothing to forgive
It's ok to start again

The wedding cake
Almost fades into a memory thrown
In cupid's face
Love's just frosting anyway
They both think back to long ago
When thoughts of them both
Growing old
Had given them the grey hair they
Deserved
Singing bye bye bye...
Well I've come to take you home

Another wife
Neglected to the end
Lives her on prison life
Solitaire's not just a game

She called his bluff
Even thought the token and gold
Watch were never enough
To tell the time and start again

It seems all of these tragedies
That last and last eternities
Have broken every bank and every
Bone singing bye bye bye...
Well I've come to take you home
