Tune in, drop out of love,
Pull the trigger, I'm a hippie,
So said a truth, in blood,
Alive and well,
You push the buttons.

Standing in line of fire,
For the whole,
My soul,
Step codes,
The drums,
And sing,
Love the children,
Learn to live with everything.

Love love love, I'm a trigger hippie, yeah
Love love love, we're trigger hippies, yeah.

Zoom in, cut out, add sound, 
Make it feel so trippy
Hung up, let down to ground,
Forget the kill it's far to sticky

Love love love, I'm a trigger hippie, yeah
Love love love, we're trigger hippies, yeah.

Love love love, I'm a trigger hippie, yeah
Love love love, we're trigger hippies, yeah.

Love love love, I'm a trigger hippie, yeah
Love love love, we're trigger hippies, yeah.
