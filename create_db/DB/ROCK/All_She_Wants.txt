Old men were throwing dice
The night you fell in love
She walked into the light
Like an angel from above

But this girls been a block or two
Just about time for someone new
What she really means by how d'ya do
Is boy I'm gonna walk all over you

All she wants from you is a good time lover
Pretty litle boy for a week or two
Gonna break your heart and it won't recover
Leaving you all bitter and blue

You gout so much to say but
She just don't wanna hear
Shell leave you bills to pay
And you crying in your beer

Well it's no use thinking it's a honeymoon
All your gonna hear from now till noon
Just a broken man in a rented room
Keep playing that lady's favourite tune

All she wants from you is a good time lover
Gonna go right out and find some other
Do the same thing that she did to you
But she needs to know that you'll always love her
Like a harem in a desert sea
In her big black book gonna put your number
Let your love sink in a sea of dreams

there's a place that she left long ago (goodbye girl)
Where a boy used her only for show (goodbye girl)
Came the time for the end of her world
Told her thank you but now it's goodbye, it's goodbye
Goodbye girl

Well it's no use thinking it's a honeymoon
All you're gonna hear from now till noon
Just a broken man in a rented room
Keep playing that lady's favourite tune

All she wants from you is a good time lover
Pretty little boy for a week or two
Gonna go right out and find some other
Do the same thing that she did to you

But she needs to know that you'll always lover her
Like a harem in a desert sea
In her big black book gonna out your number
All she wants

Its been goodbye all along - goodbye all along
(repeat to fade)
