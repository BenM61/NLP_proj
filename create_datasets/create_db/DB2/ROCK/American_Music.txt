I see you down in the front line
Such a sight for sore eyes
You're a suicide makeover
Plastic eyes

Looking through a numb skull
Sell effaced, what's his face
You erased yourself
So shut up, you don't let up

You have a growth that must be treated
Like a sudden severe pain in the neck
You can smell it but you can't see it
No explanation identified
'Cause you don't know, you don't say

And you got no reply
Hey you, where did you come from?
Got a head full of lead
You're an inbred bastard son

All dressed up, redblooded
A mannequin, do or die, no reply
Don't deny that you're synthetic
You're pathetic
