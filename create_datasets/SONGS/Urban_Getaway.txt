Sometimes I feel like I should not be living here
Feeling Shostakovich
Sometimes the things you say they really frustrate m
Twice in as many hours
I live within
A two kilometre, it's now a barrier
Near perfect circle
I snapped you left with nothing more to say
I got carried away
Please carry me away

Sun shining, it's holidays
Much needed, urban getaway
I'm smiling, it's Holidays
The Nature's got something to say

Looks like you've heard
And I can understand you're sad
Please don't analyze it
I'm not the guy who look for a ride then said
I guess your paying for it
I live within
A two kilometer, it's now a barrier
Near perfect circle
Damn straight you're strong
But be honest your wrong
And I can carry on
Lets try to carry on

Sun shining, it's holidays
Much needed, urban getaway
I'm smiling, it's Holidays
The Nature's got something to say

(Outro:) Looks like, you've heard, and I can understand you're sad
