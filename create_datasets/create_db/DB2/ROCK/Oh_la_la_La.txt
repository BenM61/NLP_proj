And it rolls 
And it goes 
I see lovers 
I see losers 
And it's heavy 
And it's funny 
Sparks fly tears roll 

O la la la 
O la la la 
C'est magnifique 

Too many failures 
Too many winners 
Have a good time 
Too much nothing 
Tooty frooty wooty 
Tooty frooty wooty 

She looks so snappy she's so pretty 
She looks so snappy she's so pretty 

O la la la 
O la la la 
C'est magnifique 

Too much pressure 
Too much talk 
Too many singers 
Too many songs 

O la la la 
O la la la 
C'est magnifique 

O la la la 
O la la la
