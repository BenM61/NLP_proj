You touch my hand
I live for you
Because your eyes
They understand
I live for you

Come to me
Lay your body down
I won't deny you anything
Look at me
I feel so different now
You're the one I cry to

You're all around me
I breathe you in like air
Your arms have found me
Like waves that find the sand
And, baby, I'll be there

[Chorus]
You touch my hand
I live for you
Because your eyes 
They understand
I live for you
In my life
You come through
I live for... 
I live for...
I live for you

Walk with me
The future's in the wind
Though the road is winding
I'll be near
Talk to me
Tell me all your fears
I'm the one you cry to

You call me lover
And tell me I'm your life
I won't run for cover
I've shown you who I am
And in the darkest night

[Chorus]

In your arms, I come alive
In my life
I am free
No one could ever understand what you do to me

[Chorus]

You hear my soul
So deep in you
Nobody knows the things you know
I live for you
In my life
You come through
I live for...
I live for...
I live for you
