Love, love, love
I ain't supposed to give it to you
Love, love, love, love, love
Until you start approchin' me true

Love, love, love, love, love
I don't mean to be picky but its life's education
Love, love, love, love, love
And the chase that makes the sensation
Love, love, love, love

Everyday, everyday I wondered how I'm gonna get through it
Took the page of the 'Book Of Life', said there was nothing through it
From chapter to chapter I was after the definition of true love
I didn't know what to do

Love, love, love
I ain't supposed to give it to you
Love, love, love, love, love
Until you start approchin' me through

Love, love, love, love, love
I don't mean to be picky but its life's education
Love, love, love, love, love
And the chase that makes the sensation
Love, love, love, love

It took so long to come around and say, hello
But now it's so strong, I never wanna let it go
My heart, my pain, my strength, it isn't so emotionally
Mama said it's the way it's gon' be

But I must believe if you could sing your Kenny G
Specially if it's only the situation left to me, yeah
I must believe if you can see then you can achieve
Specially if it's only the situation left to me for the love, love, love

Love, love, love
I ain't supposed to give it to you
Love, love, love, love, love
Until you start approchin' me through

Love, love, love, love, love
I don't mean to be picky but its life's education
Love, love, love, love, love
And the chase that makes the sensation
Love, love, love, love

My love is yours if you can enjoy
The times spent back and forth
My life's revolving door
My heart is yours, but can I be sure

That this time our love
Anything you do for me
Ain't that the way it's supposed to be
Specially if it's only a situation left to me

You know that I must believe
If you can see then you can achieve
Specially if it's only
A situation left to me for the

Love, love, love
I ain't supposed to give it to you
Love, love, love, love, love
Until you start approchin' me through

Love, love, love, love, love
I don't mean to be picky but its life's education
Love, love, love, love, love
And the chase that makes the sensation
Love, love, love, love

Love, love, love, love
