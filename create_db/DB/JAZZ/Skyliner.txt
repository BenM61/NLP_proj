Skyliner, skyliner
Flying so freely
We seem to really
Touch heaven higher
Higher, ever higher

Sunbeams all dance
On your wings
Where the light falls
And then when night falls
Stars dance above

Giving a show
For the people below
As we fly, as we fly
So high

Hearing each single beat
Of the motor's repeat
With a sigh, baby
By and by

[Chorus]
I'll hold him close
That's the sweet song they sing me
Skyliner, bring me home to love

I'm hurrying home to you
I'm through with being lonely
I'm hurrying home to you
Don't you know you're
My one and only

Fast, fast, traveling fast
Dear, all the quarrels of the past
We'll keep in the past, dear

I wanna be in your arms
Where I can hug and kiss you
I wanna be in your arms
Wanna show you the way I miss you

Fast, fast, traveling fast
Dear, and to have you close
Is all that I'm thinking of

[Chorus]
