Professor Night haunts a bar
Where he says that there are two chicks for every guy
He says hi and gets laid, he's got it made and he hardly has to try

And they don't put up a fight with Professor Night
Oh no they don't put up a fight with Professor Night
He's Professor Night

Professor Night has a flair
Combs his hair with something the barber recommends
He blends right in and takes control
He really plays the role at least he tries with all his might

And they don't put up a fight with Professor Night
Oh no they don't put up a fight with Professor Night
Meet Professor Night

He's the Professor, he's Professor Night, he's the Professor

He's got a million lies on top, got to keep the ladies happy
He says anything that makes the river flow
Is good to know Professor Night

Professor Night has no love
And a driving glove won't keep U warm when the storm comes down
Pound for pound he's a loser
A destroyer not a cruiser, Johnny on the spot not Mister Right

And they don't put up a fight with Professor Night
Oh no they don't put up a fight with Professor Night
Meet Professor Night

He's the Professor, meet Professor Night
He's the Professor, he professed the night
He's the Professor, meet Professor Night
He's the Professor, he professed the night
