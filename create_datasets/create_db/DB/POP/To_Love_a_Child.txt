As one human to another, I'd like to question you (what's the question?)
If it takes the sun and the rain to make a tree grow, (that's a hard one)
If it takes the moon and the tide to make the sea flow
What does it take to love a child? (to love a child)
To love a child (to love a child)

To love a child (to love a child), hm, hm, hm (hm, hm, hm)
(Said the bigger to the smaller raccoon, do you need someone to move you)
(Said the smaller to the bigger raccoon, if you move I will follow)
(Up they went to climb a tree, they end the day most happily)
(Anything that they can do, humans can do too)
As one human to another, I'd like to question you.
If it takes the sun and the rain to make the tree grow, (to make the tree grow)

What does it take to love a child? (to love a child)
To love a child (to love a child)

To love a child (to love a child), to love a child (hm, hm, hm)
To love a child
