Someone lights the moon in the sky above
Moon beams pour but they're for
Only those in love
Love
My all
I would gladly give for a chance to live
In the world of love
Someone send the one
That I'm dreaming of
Give my heart to part of
Only those in love

Jealously my eyes
Watch the little dove
All day through cooing to 
Only those in love
Love
My all
I would gladly give for a chance to live
In the world of love
Someone send the one
That I'm dreaming of
Give my heart to part of
Only those in love
