Now if I give up, my friends I know
And in return, you give up yours, before we think
What would we do later on
What kind of life would we have, just in case we both were wrong

I could give up my woman, you could give up your man
But it don't make sense to, take the chance, before we think
What would we do later on
What kind of life would we have, just in case we both were wrong

Horn Solo

They say love is a gamble, and we know that's true
So why gamble on me and and, why should I on you before we think
What would we do later on
What kind of life would we have, just in case we both were wrong
