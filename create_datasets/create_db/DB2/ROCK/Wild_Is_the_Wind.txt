Love me, love me, love me, love me
Say you do
Let me fly away
With you
For my love is like
The wind
And wild is the wind
Wild is the wind

Give me more
Than one caress
Satisfy this
Hungriness
Let the wind
Blow through your heart
For wild is the wind
Wild is the wind

You
Touch me
I hear the sound
Of mandolins
You
Kiss me
With your kiss
My life begins
You're spring to me
All things
To me

Don't you know you're
Life itself

Like a leaf clings
To the tree
Oh my darling,
Cling to me
For we're like creatures
Of the wind
Wild is the wind
Wild is the wind

You
Touch me
I hear the sound
Of mandolins
You
Kiss me
With your kiss
My life begins
You're spring to me
All things
To me

Don't you know you're
Life itself

Like a leaf clings
To the tree
Oh my darling,
Cling to me
For we're like creatures
In the wind
And wild is the wind
Wild is the wind

Wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
