Party girl, party girl.
Why don't you stay at home.
Party girl, party girl.
Why don't you stay at home.
You've lost all your glamour,
And your health its almost gone.

Party girl, party girl.
You used to be so fine.
Party girl, party girl,
You used to be so fine.
Bright lights and whiskey has caused you to lose your mind.

You drink straight whiskey,
Til it makes your tonsells sore.
You've got bags under your eyes
Big as a barn yard door.
Wake up Party girl, don't you know the cops around.
Your dead on your feet,
And your on your last go round.
