Mirror, mirror 
Is on the shelf 
Found another way 
To ruin and waste my health 
Took to the flame 
Put the blade away 
Just cut my lifeline 
Quickly in half today 
Chemical euphoria 
I'm about to crack 
Mass hysteria 
Won't get off my back 
Chemical euphoria 
I'm about to crack 
Mass hysteria 
Speeds my heart attack 

When it rains it pours 
And man I'd say 
Looks like it's time 
To build an arc today 
Absorb me to a pleasant void 
Somewhere temptation 
Can't link it's hand to destroy 

Chemical euphoria 
I'm about to crack 
Mass hysteria 
Won't get off my back 
Chemical euphoria 
I'm about to crack 
Mass hysteria 
Speeds my heart attack 
The heart attack 

Addicted and there's no release 
Addicted won't you help me please 
Oh how the road bends 
Off the deep end 

Mirror, mirror 
Is on the shelf 
Can't find satisfaction 
Til I help myself 
Took to the flame 
Put the blade away 
Here come the lookout 
What a price to pay 

Chemical euphoria 
I'm about to crack 
Mass hysteria 
Won't get off my back 
Chemical euphoria 
I'm about to crack 
Mass hysteria 
Speedin' up the heart attack 

Chemical euphoria 
Chemical euphoria 
Chemical euphoria
