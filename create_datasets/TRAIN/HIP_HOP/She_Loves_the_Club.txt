Damn you playing games already
'Cause you sorta got me sea-sick, waving your belly
Like in and out then out and then in
Then back to out, girl drop your friends

'Cause I ain't trying to have 'em with us all night
Face looking all tight, ask if it's alright
If you just leave for a minute, come back
My mind freeze for a minute, but your waist throwback

You looking good in that teeny-weeny-mini skirt
Girl you hot as a shorty, any cherry-red lipstick
Sucking a lollipop, winding your body
Looking at me, ma' you know you need to stop

You got my hands all over you
Girl you got something, nothing I don't do
And I can see you're down to do whatever
You's a girl gone wild so now it's going down tonight

Shorty love the club, and she like to go
On and on and on and on and on and
She love the club and she like to make it
Drop and crank it up and ride the pony

Shorty love the club, and she like to go
On and on and on and on and on and
She love the club and she like to make it
Get it, get it girl, get it, get it girl

Shorty's bad as hell and she knows it, ferocious
I could've sworn I seen mami on a poster
And she keeps moving closer and closer
She's a pro so I don't have to coach her

I'm digging her 'cause she handle her business
My hand on her hip, when I dip then she dip
And all the homies want to dance with her
'Cause she's hot to death, young and sexy, she loves the club

Shorty love the club, and she like to go
On and on and on and on and on and
She love the club and she like to make it
Drop and crank it up and ride the pony

Shorty love the club, and she like to go
On and on and on and on and on and
She love the club and she like to make it
Get it, get it girl, get it, get it girl

Wait, I need time to breathe
Just a minute and I promise I'mma follow your lead
And we could, two step to the bass line
Hands on your waistline, I don't understand why we waste time

'Cause you bumped and grind
And the reason why we still here, stumps my mind, mama
I see you sorta looking like you want more
So we can do the same thing with our clothes off, holla

Girl, we might as well, be crushing on the floor
Our bodies so close, your skin is so soft
Tonight I'mma slide with you, girl

Girl, do you like what you see?
Girl you know what you're doing
Turn around and dance for me

Now dance little mama
You like it when I shake my, don't you? Yeah
Now dance little mama
Let me show you what I'm twerking with, whoa

Now dance little mama
Like to go on and on and on and on and on and
Now dance little mama
Come and get it boy, come and get it boy

Shorty love the club, and she like to go
On and on and on and on and on and
She love the club and she like to make it
Drop and crank it up and ride the pony

Shorty love the club, and she like to go
On and on and on and on and on and
She love the club and she like to make it
Get it, get it girl, get it, get it girl
