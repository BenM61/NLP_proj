Late into the night
Comes a glow like ice
I don't recognize
There in black and white
All your twisted thoughts

Brutal starry eyes
Stuck inside your head
Fallen from the sky
Risen from the dead
Views from all the past
Taken to new heights

Melancholy sky
You made me blue
Still hanging on
There's nothing I can do
Not this time

There you are again
Calling from the hills
Haunted and the damned
From imagined worlds
It's too late my friend
I don't love you anymore

Melancholy sky
You made me blue
Still hanging on
There's nothing I can do
Melancholy sky
Still hanging on
You're crazy now
I didn't do you wrong
Not this time
