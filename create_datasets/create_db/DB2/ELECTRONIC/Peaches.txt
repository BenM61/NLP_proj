I've been working on my knees baby it's alright
Everybody got disease maybe it's alright

You can steal from me baby that's just fine
You can say it's free baby that's alright

Working on a feeling
Breaking down the ceiling
Digging up a deep end
Freezing on the beaches
Reaching for the sweetest, sweetest peaches

We won't live too long
So let's love for one song
The lion won't lay down
When the holy man's in town

You've been drinking all week baby that's alright
You've been stepping on me baby it's alright

You've been tearing me apart in the dead of night
I'll be raising my hands when the lighting strikes

Working on a feeling
Breaking down the ceiling
Digging up a deep end
Freezing on the beaches
Reaching for the sweetest, sweetest peaches

We won't live too long
So let's love for one song
The lion won't lay down
When the holy man's in town

Working on a feeling
Breaking down the ceiling
Digging up a deep end
Freezing on the beaches
Reaching for the sweetest, sweetest peaches

We won't live too long
So let's love for one song
The lion won't lay down
When the holy man's in town

Working on a feeling
Breaking down the ceiling
Digging up a deep end
Freezing on the beaches
Reaching for the sweetest, sweetest peaches
