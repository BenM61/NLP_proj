Friends say I'll get over you soon
Thoughts of you come back to fill me with gloom
Time forgets but I'm not over you yet
There's no sense of asking why
Until the tears run dry

There's no one but you on my mind
Searching for a perfect ending that we'll never find
If we could make it work this time

Years have flown by since you've been gone
This broken heart of mine's been waiting too long
All alone without you I can't carry on
There's no sense of asking why
Until I'm there by your side

There's no one but you on my mind
Searching for a perfect ending that we'll never find
If we could make it work this time
We could plant tomorrow's dreams now together
In a garden to last forever more
All the flowers would grow
From the seeds we'd sow...

There's no one but you on my mind
Searching for a perfect ending that we'll never find
If we could make it work this time

There's no sense of asking why
Until the tears run dry
I could be there by your side
If you would only change your mind
If we could make it work this time
