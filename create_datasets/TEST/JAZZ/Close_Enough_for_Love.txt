You and I, an unmatched pair
Took the time to touch, to share
Worlds apart the night we met
We braved the odds and won the bet

Not perfect yet
But close enough for love

How old-fashioned, pure romance
We shared a kiss, we shared the dance
We shared the body and bouquet
And we'll taste the wine another day

When you and I
Are close enough for love

Not just lovers, more than friends
Who knows where one starts and one ends
Tracing lights through sleepless nights
That I'll remember always, always

Long goodbyes and tearful looks
Hold up well in poems and in books
But you and I have life to hold
The greatest story never told

Not perfect yet
But close enough for love
