...oh...
Oh, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah
Ooh, ooh
Oh, yeah, yeah

Sitting here
Daydreamin' about you
Oh, everything we had
Wish I could get it back

?Cause if it ain't you, then I don't want it
And if it ain't you, then it ain't for me
I can see your face whenever I be sleepin'
But it hurts when I realize I'm dreamin'

So if I can't have you
I'll just be single for the rest of my life (My life)
?Cause you can't be replaced by nobody else
I'll go crazy if I can't have you for myself (If I
can't have you)

If I can't have you (I'll be)
I'll just be single for the rest of my life 
I've decided that nobody could compare to you (Nobody)
There's nobody that can make me feel the way you do
(Oh)

There've been a few
Who've tried to take your place
I've been on many dates
Still it just ain't the same

if its not a letter sent from you, then I don't read it
If it's not a gift sent from you, then I don't need it
I've been longin' just to find somebody like you
But nobody can just do it quite like you, if I

So if I can't have you
I'll just be single for the rest of my life
?Cause you can't be replaced by nobody else
I'll go crazy if I can't have you for myself (I'll go crazy)

If I can't have you
I'll just be single for the rest of my life
I've decided that nobody could compare to you 

There's nobody that can make me feel the way you do

I took your pictures off the wall
That didn't seem to help at all
So I'mma put it out there, I'mma let you know
If you need to rest your head you can come back home

I thought that I could live without your love, you
know I tried
But I feel incomplete when I don't have you in my life
So I'mma put it out there, I'mma let you know (Let you
know)
If you need to rest your head you can come back home
(Come back home)

So if I can't have you
I'll just be single for the rest of my life
?Cause you can't be replaced by nobody else
I'll go crazy if I can't have you for myself

If I can't have you
I'll just be single for the rest of my life
I've decided that nobody could compare to you 
There's nobody that can make me feel the way you do

So if I can't have you
I'll just be single for the rest of my life
?Cause you can't be replaced by nobody else (Nobody)
I'll go crazy if I can't have you for myself (Oh, oh)

If I can't have you (If I can't have you)
I'll just be single for the rest of my life (I'll just
be single)
I've decided that nobody could compare to you 
There's nobody that can make me feel the way you do

Nobody can make me feel like you do
Oh, no, nobody
Can make me feel the way you do
