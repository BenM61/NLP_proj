I'm walking
Blue eyes down
Orphan town
Wisdom town
Let me know the way

You said so
You said you're mine
There's no world without you
When statues crumble into sand
You're my crucifix in dream land

Midnight 
Crashing down
Lonesome town
Spanish town
Fire flies in jars
And street cars of my desire
There's no love without you
When statues crumble into sand 
You're my crucifix in dream land

Will you come back my runaway
There'll be no rain coats on that splendid day
I'd know you any where
I've heard you in the desert air
Where dragons live and taxis line up
In the dark

You said so
You said you're mine
There's no love without you
When statues crumble into sand
You're my crucifix in dream land
