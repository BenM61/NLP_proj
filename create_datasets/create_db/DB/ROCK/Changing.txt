You fall apart each time you start to say goodbye
But there is nobody watching.
(nobody watching)
You've watched your grip, you step and slip but don't know why.
And this is just the beginning.
(just the beginning)
You had the hopes to make it last, it's moving fast.
And now you're realizing.
(realizing)
That in the past, the dreams you had make people feel
Like you were just reciting.
(just reciting)

Bathing in the afterglow;
A chance at luck and pride.
Where we end up we can never know.
And all I know is we seem to be

Changing, better to turn and walk away.
Fading, all these lights just turn to gray.
Changing, better to turn and walk away.
But the strange thing
Is that I don't feel a thing.

This is an act, stop holding back. The things you lost
Cannot replace what's missing.
(replace what's missing)
And from the start you played the part and now your heart's
Become a great deception.

Bathing in the afterglow;
A chance at luck and pride.
When we end up we can never know.
All I know is we seem to be

Changing, better to turn and walk away.
Fading, all these lights just turn to gray.
Changing, better to turn and walk away.
But the strange thing
Is that I don't feel a thing.

One last breath to say goodbye.
I tell myself another lie.
Stripped of all I hold so dear.
The moment's lost.
And I am sinking down lower,
I drown myself in the water.
And I am watching my life pass before my eyes,
It comes as no surprise.

You fall apart and then you stop.
You fall apart and then you stop.
You fall apart and then you
Stop.

Changing, better to turn and walk away.
Fading, all these lights just turn to gray.
Now I'm changing, better to turn and walk away.
But the strange thing
Is that I don't feel a thing.

You fall apart and then you stop.
You fall apart and then you stop.
You fall apart and then you
Stop.
