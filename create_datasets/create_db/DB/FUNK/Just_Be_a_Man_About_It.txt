Hey, hey, hold up a minute
Let me stop up here and use this pay phone real quick
Hey, hey, Toni, it's me; I was calling
You know, just calling to let you know
Don't wait up for me tonight
I mean, I just got a lot of things on my
Mind I gotta think about, you know
Just um, I'll be over Brian's house
You know, it's not you, it's me
You know it's really me, you know
I mean basically, I just think I'm gonna
Need some space

Why are you calling me on the phone?
Why you not at home on time?
You say you're staying over at your friends
'Cause you got a lot on your mind
Now you're swearing up and down that it ain't me
Still, you say that things have changed
So, tell me, what exactly does it mean
When you say you need your space?

Just don't make no excuses, no, no
Why you gotta lie to me?
Just be a man about it
Baby, you don't gotta lie to me, no
Just be a man about it
If you want to leave, go on
Just be a man about it
Come and grab your things and go on
Right now
Just be a man about it

I mean, you gotta understand I love you
You know what I'm saying
And I love you enough to say that I think
I think you deserve somebody better
Than me, you know
And right now, I can't give you what
You need, you know

I mean, I want to love you
And I'm gonna love you, one day
But you know, I mean, you just gotta understand
Where I'm coming from

You say right now that you're not
What I'm looking for
And what you really need is time to grow
You're promising that one day you may
Come around
And I'm supposed to let that go
But where the hell do you get off
Telling me your mama said
I'm not what you need?
Tell you what, since she knows it all
Then that's where you need to be

Just don't make no excuses, no, no
Why you gotta lie to me?
Just be a man about it
Baby, you don't gotta lie to me, no
Just be a man about it
If you want to leave, go on
Just be a man about it
Come and grab your things and go on
Right now
Just be a man about it

Can you tell me how you can
Say you're loved and then
Treat me so bad?
Boy, you know it just ain't right
I cannot believe the way you handled things
You wouldn't lie if you were a man

Just don't make no excuses, no, no
Why you gotta lie to me?
Just be a man about it
Baby, you don't gotta lie to me, no
Just be a man about it
If you want to leave, go on
Just be a man about it
Come and grab your things and go on
Right now
Just be a man about it
