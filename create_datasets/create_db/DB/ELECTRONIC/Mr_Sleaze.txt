[Chorus]
Dirty dirty
Dirty dirty
Dirty dirty
Dirty dirty
He's dirty and mean
He's just a sleaze machine

He's not here to please
He's only here to tease
He may look cute but he's unclean
And you don't know where he's been
He'll bring you to your knees
'Cause he's Mister Sleaze

[Chorus: x2]

He's not here to please
He's only here to tease
He may look cute but he's unclean
And you don't know where he's been
He'll bring you to your knees
'Cause he's Mister Sleaze

[Chorus: x2]
