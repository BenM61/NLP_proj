Watch the world argue
Argue with itself
Who's gonna teach me
Peace and happiness?

We can sit here forever
Just never get old
Listen to the world
Letting Gods tie us down

Hit cities, sharp knives
Right clothing
Dancing on the jetty
So our feet stay dry

Watch the world argue
Argue with itself
Who's gonna teach me
Peace and happiness?

Watch the world argue
Argue with itself
Who's gonna teach me
Peace and happiness?

Blood is upon the steps
Two thousand years ago
Pray like hell every war in fight
Another war in the holy land

Shock the world
True story
Snap decisions
In our moment's glory
We're gonna watch them keep it strong

Watch the world argue
Argue with itself
Who's gonna teach me
Peace and happiness?

Watch the world argue
Argue with itself
Who's gonna teach me
Peace and happiness?

We're making trouble
We change tracks
Fool the system
Take time to take notice

Hit cities, sharp knives
Right clothing
Dancing on the jetty

Watch the world argue
Argue with itself
Who's gonna teach me
Peace and happiness?

Watch the world argue
Argue with itself
Who's gonna teach me
Peace and happiness?
