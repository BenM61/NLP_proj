Born to Expire
Exhausted, but still I can't sleep
I'm trying to survive another fucking week
Meaningless job, a menial slave
Absorbing knowledge to bring to my grave

Born to expire
Frustrating, seething and teemed
My blood's boiling higher
God please, please set me free

Little bits of bullshit making me weak
I don't want my life to be hopelessly bleak
Sweating like a dog just to get in this game

And I'm just a number no name

How much more does life have in store
Before the reaper comes to get paid?
Authorites catch
Civil laws don't match
And it takes my P.M.A.
Staring at the walls, constantly numb
Try to think of what I can do for fun
Aggravation coursing through my nerves
Can't sit here as the world burns
