The radio plays my holiday faves
It takes me back to when our love was new
Young lovers pass me by with their glow
That used to be us not so long ago
You said then
"I just want to spend a silent night with you"
With you
A silent night with you

Joy to the world, your arms kept me warm
Night after night, in such a cold world
Hear the bell strike, old pictures instead
Tell me the past is filling my head
You said then
"I just want to spend a silent night with you"
With you
A silent night with you

The radio plays my holiday faves
It takes me back to when our love was new
Lost in my daze, you slip past and say
"Girl, take my hand, see, nothing has changed
Now or then
I just want to spend a silent night with you"
With you
A silent night with you

All is calm
All is bright.
