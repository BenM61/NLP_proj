I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill
On Blueberry Hill, when I found you.

The moon stood still on Blueberry Hill
And lingered until my dream came true.

The wind in the willow played, love's sweet melody

But all of those vows you made were never to be
Though we're apart, you're part of me still

For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill.
