Know it sounds funny but, I just can't stand the pain
Girl, I'm leaving you tomorrow
Seems to me girl you know I've done all I can
You see I begged, stole, and I borrowed (yeah)

Oh that's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning yeah
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning

I wanna be high, so high
I wanna be free to know the things I do are right
I wanna be free
Just me whoa, oh babe

Oh that's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning, yeah
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning
