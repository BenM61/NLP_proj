Could you be loved and be loved?
Could you be loved and be loved?

Don't let them fool ya,
Or even try to school ya! Oh, no!
We've got a mind of our own,
So go to hell if what you're thinking is not right!
Love would never leave us alone,
Ayin the darkness there must come out to light.

Could you be loved and be loved?
Could you be loved, wo now!  and be loved?

(The road of life is rocky and you may stumble too,
So while you point your fingers someone else is judging you)
Love your brotherman!
(Could you be  could you be  could you be loved?
Could you be  could you be loved?
Could you be  could you be  could you be loved?
Could you be  could you be loved?)

Don't let them change ya, oh! 
Or even rearrange ya! Oh, no!
We've got a life to live.
They say: only  only 
Only the fittest of the fittest shall survive 
Stay alive! Eh!

Could you be loved and be loved?
Could you be loved, wo now!  and be loved?

(You ain't gonna miss your water until your well runs dry;
No matter how you treat him, the man will never be satisfied.)
