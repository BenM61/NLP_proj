At night my love is you,
Love is like the fun time
Congratulations,
My love is just the same old song
Girl, girl you getting me in trouble

Bringing me down, bringing me up,
Spinning me all around
Girl, girl you're nothing but trouble

I can't get with you,
Can't live without you
Breaking up is hard to do
Can't get used to loosing you
I need you, oh yes girl is true
Congratulations,
My love am
Using self control
Girl, girl you're nothing but trouble

Bringing me down,
Bringing me up,
Spinning me all around
Girl, girl you're nothing but trouble

Shake it loose,
I just can't smile without you
Can't those boys just see that you're mine
Girl I can't wait another minute
To say I love you, and say she's mine

Congratulations,
My love is the same old song
Girl, girl you getting me in trouble

Bringing me down, bringing me up,
Spinning me all around
Girl, girl you're nothing but trouble

Hey sugar mama you're the one in my mind
Let me tell you how I feel my love is blind
Bewitched by you and the things you do
Am overjoyed with being with you
You're the one on top of my list
Number one in my chart
The only thing I really want is
To make good love to you
My darling you're with me
Can't shake it loose!
Can't start without you
Can't those boys just see that you're mine
Girl can't wait another minute
Can say I love you,
Can say she's mine
Congratulations,

Girl is true
Congratulations,
Am using self control
Bringing me down, bringing me up,
Spinning me all around
Girl, girl you're nothing but trouble
