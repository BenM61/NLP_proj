Some boys hate themselves
Spend their lives resenting their fathers
Some girls hate their bodies
Stand in the mirror and wait for the feedback

Saying God, make me famous
If you can't just make it painless
Just make it painless

Assisted suicide
She dreams about dying all the time
She told me she came so close
Filled up the bathtub and put on our first record

Saying God, make me famous
If you can't just make it painless
Just make it painless

It goes on and on, I don't know what I want
On and on, I don't know if I want it
On and on, I don't know what I want
On and on, I don't know if I want it
(On and on I don't know what I want)
(On and on I don't know if I want it)
(On and on I don't know what I want)
(On and on I don't know if I want it)

Some girls hate themselves
Hide under the covers with sleeping pills and
Some girls cut themselves
Stand in the mirror and wait for the feedback
Some boys get too much, too much love, too much touch
Some boys starve themselves
Stand in the mirror and wait for the feedback

Creature comfort makes it painless
Bury me penniless and nameless
Born in a diamond mine
It's all around you but you can't see it
Born in a diamond mine
It's all around you but you can't touch it

Saying God, make me famous
If you can't just make it painless
Just make it painless

It's not painless
She was a friend of mine, a friend of mine
And we're not nameless, oh

It goes on and on, I don't know what I want
On and on, I don't know if I want it
On and on, I don't know what I want
On and on, I don't know if I want it
(On and on I don't know what I want)
(On and on I don't know if I want it)
(On and on I don't know what I want)
Well if you're not sure, better safe than sorry

Creature comfort, make it painless
Creature comfort, make it painless

We're the bones under your feet
The white lie of American prosperity
We wanna dance but we can't feel the beat
I'm a liar, don't doubt my sincerity

Just make it painless
Creature comfort, make it painless

Na-na-na-na 
Na-na-na na-na-na-na 
(Na-na-na-na na-na-na)
(Na-na-na-na na-na-na)
Na-na-na na-na-na-na 
Na-na-na na-na-na-na 
(Na-na-na-na na-na-na)
Creature comfort, make it painless
