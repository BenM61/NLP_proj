Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm telling the world, here and now
That I'm gonna love you and love you
I take this vow (yeah)
You captured my heart, so long ago
Still there are some critical things
That you should know (yeah yeah yeah)

Do I give all I am
To be all and forever your man?
Do I take you to be?
Without question, the woman for me
Do I promise you? I do
Do I promise you? I do, I do

This love has been worth
But waiting for
This love doesn't matter to me
If it's not yours
As we become one
Through and through
I dedicate all of my life
To loving you (yeah yeah yeah)

Do I give all I am
To be all and forever your man?
Do I take you to be?
Without question, the woman for me
Do I promise you? I do
Do I promise you? I do, I do

To have and to hold
Our passions unfold
I promise a life you won't regret
For better or worse
No one can reverse the way that I've felt
Since we met
And you ain't seen nothing yet

Do I give all I am
To be all and forever your man?
Do I take you to be?
Without question, the woman for me
Do I swear on my life?
We'll be happy as husband and wife

Do I promise you?
Do I promise you?
Do I promise you? I do
Do I promise you? I do, I do (I, I do)
