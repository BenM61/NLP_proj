Farther on up the road
Someone gonna hurt you like you hurt me
Farther on up the road
Someone gonna hurt you like you hurt me
Farther on up the road
Baby, you just wait and see

You got to reap just what you sow
That old saying is true
You got to reap just what you sow
That old saying is true
Like you mistreated someone
Someone gonna mistreat you

Mmm baby

Now you're laughing, pretty baby
Someday you're gonna be crying
Now you're laughing, pretty baby
Some someday you're gonna be crying
Farther on up the road
You'll find out I wasn't lying

Yeah baby
Hmm baby

Farther on up the road
When you're all alone and blue
Farther on up the road
When you're all alone and blue
You gonna ask me to take you back, baby
But I'll have somebody new

Hmm baby
Hmm baby

Ooh, farther on up the road
