Lies, lies, using lies as alibis
Lie's, lies, just a devil in disguise

It's the same game
Played in so many ways
Everyone is the victim too
It's just a waste of time
Made for simple minds
So why do people insist on lies

I'll give my life a different way
Refuse to let myself become a victim
Getting caught you in a vicious web of lies, they can hurt you
And destroy you, you watch out for lies, just a devil in disguise

Lies, lies, using lies as alibis
Lie's, lies, just a devil in disguise

The nation's leaders as well as teachers
Practice lies as a way of lie, yes they do
So think before you speak
Cause what you sow you reap

The truth will always come to light
Will we ever learn one day
That telling lies always bring to matters
Misery and sometimes pain

Lies, lies, using lies as alibis
Lie's, lies, just a devil in disguise

Lies, lies, using lies as alibis
Lie's, lies, just a devil in disguise

Lies, lies, using lies as alibis
Lie's, lies, just a devil in disguise

Lies, lies, using lies as alibis
Lie's, lies, just a devil in disguise

Lies and deceit
Yes it's running real rampant
Communities suffering, yo I can't stand it
When we think of lies we tend to think of politicians
But what about the husband who's on a mission
Lying to his wife so he can get it on and get some
Coming back home with a dumb expression
Written on a face that he's guilty as a criminal
It's time to change your attitude
People do you hear me, don't listen
To a funky rhyme that's kickin' knowledge that we need
We lie about our hair
And we know we got a weave
Politicians lie about the things they're gonna do
And everybody's tale affects me and you
A smoker lies about the money that he stole
And a dope dealer never tells you how he got his gold
I guess what Debbie T. is really trying to say
When you break it all down we're all the same

I'll live my life a different way
Refuse to let myself be caught up
In a vicious web of lies

Lies, lies, using lies as alibis
Lie's, lies, just a devil in disguise

Lies, lies, using lies as alibis
Lie's, lies, just a devil in disguise

Lies, lies, using lies as alibis
Lie's, lies, just a devil in disguise

Lies, lies, using lies as alibis
Lie's, lies, just a devil in disguise
