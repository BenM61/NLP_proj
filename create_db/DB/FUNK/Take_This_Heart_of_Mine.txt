Ooh, you say you're feelin' nervous
The least thing makes you cry
Sounds like a real bad case of a girl who needs a guy
I think I know the perfect jewel
The one you ought to try
Take a heart that's full of love, on this you can rely

And if you need some quick reaction, take this heart of mine
And if you need some satisfaction, take this heart of mine
And if you're tired of being lonely, take this heart of mine
I think I can help you if you'll only take this heart of mine

I may not be a doctor who can cure your ills
Goodbye to all those different drugs and hard-to-swallow pills
My remedy is older than the tale of Jack and Jill
My prescription is the kind you love to have refilled

If you need some satisfaction, take this heart of mine
If you need some quick reaction, take this heart of mine
Baby, if you're tired of being lonely, take this heart of mine
Honey, I can help you if you'll only take this heart of mine

Got a lovin' side (this heart of mine)
That's pure as gold (this heart of mine)
Take it, it's yours (this heart of mine)
Have and to hold (this heart of mine)
And if you do that, baby (this heart of mine)
After we grow old (this heart of mine)
We'll have the greatest love story (this heart of mine)
That was ever told (this heart of mine)
Oh, baby (greatest story that was ever told)

Oh, medicine won't cure you
Just relieve you at the most
But relief is only temporary, pretty soon it'll go
But love can last a lifetime
When two hearts are close
Take as much as you want to, there is no overdose

If you need some quick reaction, take this heart of mine
Baby, if you need some satisfaction, take this heart of mine
If you're tired of being lonely, take this heart of mine
I can help you if you'll only take this heart of mine, take it, baby
