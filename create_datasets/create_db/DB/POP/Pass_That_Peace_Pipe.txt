A medicine man I met 
Said don't get yourself in a sweat 
When things look gray, 
Just shrug and say: 
"It musta been somethin' I et!" 
"So don't get yourself in a snit, " he said, 
"Tuck your tantrums into your kit instead 
"It's disarming to be charming," 
Quoth the medicine man, 
Whom all agree it's plain to see 
Nobody could be wiser than 

So if your temper's getting a top hand, 
All you have to do is just stop and 
Pass that peace pipe and bury that hatchet 
Like the Choctaws, Chickasaws, 
Chattahoochee's, Chippewas do 

If you're feeling mad as a wet hen, 
Mad as you can possibly get, then 
Pass that peace pipe, bury that tomahawk 
Like those Chichamecks, Cherokees, 
Chapultepec's do 
That cold shoulder never solved a single complaint 
When you're older, you'll wipe off all of that war paint 

If you find yourself in a fury, 
Be your own judge and your own jury 
Pass that peace pipe and bury that hatchet 
Like the Choctaws, Chickasaws, 
Chattahoochee's, Chippewas do 

If you want to hover out west, too, 
You will soon discover it's best to 
Pass that peace pipe and bury that hatchet 
Like the Choktohs, Changos, 
Chattanooga's, Cheekarohs do 

Even in colonial days, you 
Know the ceremonial ways to 
Pass that peace pipe and bury that tomahawk 
Like those Chakootamees, Chepacheps 
'N' Chicopees, too 
Pull your ears in, try to use a little control 
When "all clear"'s in, you'll be top man on the totem pole 

So, if you wanna be an all-right guy 
Not a long face, blues-in-the-night guy 
Write that apology and dispatch it! 
When you quarrel, it's grand to patch it! 
Pass that peace pipe and bury that hatchet 

Like those Choctaws, Chickasaws, 
Chattahoochee's, Chippewas 
And those Chickadees, Cherokees, 
Chapultepecs 
And those Chakootamees, Chepacheps 
'N' Chicopees, Choktohs, Changos, 
Chattanoogas, Cheekarohs do-o-o-o
