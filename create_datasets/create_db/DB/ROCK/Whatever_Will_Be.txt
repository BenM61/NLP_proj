Sometimes I feel like I'm a bird with broken wings
At times I dread my now and envy where I've been.
Cause that's when quiet wisdom takes control
At least I've got a story no ones told

I finally learned to say

Whatever will be, will be
I learned to take
The good, the bad and breathe (the good)
Cause although we like, to know what lifes got planned
No one knows if shootings stars will land

These days it feels naive to put your faith in hope.
To imitate a child, fall backwards on the snow
Cause that's when fears will usually lead you blind
Now i try to under analyse

I finally learned to say

Whatever will be, will be
I learned to take
The good, the bad and breathe (the good)
Cause although we like, to know what lifes got planned
No one knows if shootings stars will land

Is the rope I walk wearing thin?
Is the life I love caving in?
Is the rain on your mind
A heavy black bird caged inside.

Say, Whatever will be, will be
Take, the good the bad just breathe

'Cause although,(yeah) we like, to know what lifes got planned,
No one knows if shooting stars will land

I finally learned to say!
Whatever will be will be,
I learned to take
The good the bad and breathe(the good)

'Cause although we like to know what life's got planned
Things like that are never in your hands
No one knows if shooting stars will land.
