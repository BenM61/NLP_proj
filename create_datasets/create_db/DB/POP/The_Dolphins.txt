This old world may never change
Not the way it's been
And all the ways of war
Can't change it back again

I've been searching for the dolphins in the sea
Sometimes I wonder do you ever think of me

I'm not the one to tell this world
How to get along
I only know that peace will come
When all hate is gone

I've been searching for the dolphins in the sea
Sometimes I wonder do you ever think of me

Sometimes I think about
Saturday's child
And all about the times
When we were running wild

I've been searching for the dolphins in the sea
Sometimes I wonder do you ever think of me

This old world may never change
This old world may never change
