Some friends go bowling every Saturday night
Some sit around and watch the TV fight
But all I wanna do is hold you tight

'Cause I got a one track
Yes, I've got a one track
I've got a one track mind

My buddy finds all kind of things to do
He's always coming up with something new
But all I wanna do, I wanna do with you

'Cause I got a one track
Yes, I've got a one track
I've got a one track mind

Well, I can't keep my mind
On nothing else but you
You know it's you, ain't it only you

And if there's ever anything
You ever want me to do
I'll say

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

A lot of people like to go on trips
Others stay at home
And read the comic strips
But all I want to do is kiss your lips

'Cause I got a one track
Yes, I've got a one track
I've got a one track mind

Hey, yeah, yeah

Well, I can't keep my mind
On nothing else but you
You know it's true
And it's only you

And if there's ever anything
You ever want me to do
I say

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

A lot of people like to go on trips
Some sit at home and read the comic strips
But all I want to do is kiss your lips

'Cause I got a one track
Yes, I've got a one track
I've got a one track

Oh, my, my, my, my
I've got a one track
Well, I've got a one track
You know I've got a one track

Because I love you so
I've got a one track
I've got a one track
