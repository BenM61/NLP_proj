You can't change it
Can't re-arrange it
If time is all that we got
Then baby let's take it

Lovin' is a lovin'
The moment is a-right
It's worth all the years in the past
Let's go one more night

Get away from the blind side of life
Honey I want you to be by my side
Me and my back door moves ain't no more
No more

Get away from the blind side of life
Honey I want you to be by my side
Me and my back door moves ain't no more
No more

Get away from the blind side of life
Honey I want you to be by my side
Me and my back door moves ain't no more
No more

Goodnight my darlin'
Another day has passed
Forget all those painful memories
Our love's gonna last

Come to me baby
Come to me one more time
It's time we got movin'
Time to move on
Let's slide out the door
Let's slide out the door
Ride our way home
Let's glide our way home

Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
I've come back for more
