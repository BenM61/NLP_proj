I was walkin' down the street
When this boy started following me
Though I ignored all the things he said
He moved me in every way
With his collar unbuttoned
By my side he was struttin'

He was really sayin' somethin' 
Really sayin' somethin' 
(Bop bop soo-be-do-wa)
(Bop bop soo-be-do-wa) 

He flirted every step of the way 
I could hear every word he'd say 
My resistance was gettin' low 
And my feelings started to show 
My heart started pumpin', blood pressure jumpin' 

He was really sayin' somethin', 
Really sayin' somethin' 
(Bop bop soo-be-do-wa)
(Bop bop soo-be-do-wa) 

He walked me to my door 
I agreed to see him once more 
Late night it may not be 
But he moved me tremendously 
Though he was bold, my heart he stole 
He was really sayin' somethin', 
Really sayin' somethin' 
(Bop bop soo-be-do-wa)
(Bop bop soo-be-do-wa) 

He was really sayin' somethin'
