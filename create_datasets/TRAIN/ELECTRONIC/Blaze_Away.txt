It's Morcheeba and Roots Manuva
And we are together in unity
Into the furnace we blaze away
Forevermore

No doubt, this life
Ready to go left and right
We're giving it up and bringing it all tonight
Come lay in the dark
The bed I once knew without the spark
You better believe it's there to retrieve in you

You got to celebrate and get in time
But I learn to step around the jealous kind

Come down, up high
They're gonna eat some humble pies
So gimme the knife, I'm sharing a slice or two

Big love, big night
Already in flames and we're alright
Fuel the fire, blaze away
(We blaze away)
Oh no, baby don't cry
Spin it around, tears will dry
With deep desire, here we stay

Something pours out when I think of love
Mentally blazing away, disgust
Ransoms and randoms, scared of phantom
We guess it's hurried reasonings
Of the most high
And I, and I know
Love to share like we don't care
Inside the flames, making a change
Being upstanding, more upstanding
Make it to the plateau, we never let go
And we got that saving grace
No more hatred, love for the lovers
She's my one and only, I'm no phony
Told you before, don't mess with my legacy
Let it be greatness, we can't fake this
Making the statements up to the gateway
We do it straight away because

'Cause only love can save us from the rut
From the rut, from the rut
'Cause only love can save us from the rut
From the rut, from the rut

What next? What now?
Live and let live and lose the cloud
Now that you're free, you're clearer to see the view
Oh me, oh my
Stuck in that line all this time
You gotta step up 'cause you know what the f*ck I could give

We're gonna celebrate and get in time
We're gonna learn to step around the jealous kind

Come down, up high
They're gonna eat some humble pies
So gimme the knife, I'm sharing a slice or two

Big love, big night
Already in flames and we're alright
Fuel the fire, blaze away
(We blaze away)
Oh no, baby don't cry
Spin it around, tears will dry
With deep desire, here we stay
(Blaze away)

'Cause only love can save us from the rut
From the rut, from the rut
'Cause only love can save us from the rut
From the rut, from the rut
