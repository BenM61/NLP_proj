Baby I wasn't, all the same things that you want.
Baby I need, all the same things you need.

When it comes to lovin' you, I can relate.
We're two of a kind. I know how you operate.
Baby, You are my ritual.
Burnin' in my soul. Never let you go.
You are my ritual, my ritual baby.

I love, all the same things you love.
Baby I long for, all the same things you long for. Every night!

When it comes to lovin' you, I can relate.
We're two of a kind, honey I know how you operate.
Baby, You are my ritual.
Burnin' in my soul. Never let you go.
You are my ritual, my ritual.
Baby, You are my ritual.
Burnin' in my soul. Never let you go.
You are my ritual.

Every night I worship the love we got. There's a bond between us.
Every night, I pray to the gods of love

There's a certain passion, that covers us at night.
It's more than one desire. It's a bond that keeps us tight.
Images of love, burning in my soul.
You are my ritual. I can't let go.

When it comes to lovin' you, I can relate.
We want the same things. I don't care if you make me wait.
We're two of a kind, honey I know how you operate..
Baby, You are my ritual.
Burnin' in my soul. Never let you go.
You are my ritual, my ritual
Baby, You are my ritual.
Burnin' in my soul. Never let you go.
You are my ritual, my ritual...
