'Cause you're lost in front of me
It's true, I'm losing you
'Cause you're lost in front of me
It's true, I'm losing you

And you know it's alright,
When you're gonna bring down
Take everything and live for the moment,
It's only gonna bring you down tonight

When your locked up in my view,
It's true I love you
When your locked up in my blue,
It's true I love you

And you know it's alright,
When you're gonna bring down,
Take everything and live for the moment
It's only gonna bring you down
Bring you down
Bring you down

When I'm lost I'll come to you,
So blue, I'm feeling you,
When I'm lost I'll come to you,
I'm blue, I feel you

And you know it's alright,
When you're gonna bring down,
Take everything and live for the moment
It's only gonna bring you down
Bring you down
Bring you down

And you know it's alright,
When you're gonna bring down
Take everything and live for the moment,
It's only gonna bring you down tonight
