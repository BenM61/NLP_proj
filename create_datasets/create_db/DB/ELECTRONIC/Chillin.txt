One night in a disco 
Chillin' with my friends 
Feelin' kinda low 
I was sitting on a fence 
Suddenly I saw her 
Dancing on the scene 
Just like in a dream (dream)
She would set my heart on fire 

[Chorus:]
I feel so high 
Dancing all night 
You blow my mind 
Cause you're so fine 

She had such a swing 
Anyone could see 
Her body meaning things 
That look so good to me 
Music got my head 
Spinning all around
She got me in a trance (trance)
Just by the way she danced 

[Chorus:Repeat x3]
I feel so high 
Dancing all night 
You blow my mind 
Cause you're so fine
 
(She had such a swing) I feel so high 
(Anyone could see) Dancing all night 
(Her body meaning things) You blow my mind 
(That look so good to me) 'cause you're so fine 
(Music got my head) I feel so high 
(Spinning all around) Dancing all night 
(She got me in a trance) You blow my mind 
(Just by the way she danced) 'cause you're so fine 

(Music got my head) I feel so high 
(Spinning all around) Dancing all night 
(She got me in a trance) You blow my mind 
(Just by the way she danced) ''cause you're so fine 

(Music got my head) I feel so high 
(Spinning all around) Dancing all night 
(She got me in a trance) You blow my mind 
(Just by the way she danced) 'cause you're so fine
