If you love me, you won't let me go
I don't want to leave you, no no no
So if you love me, you won't let me go

I can't go on this way
Because you won't let me stay
But if you love me, you won't let me go

I can't go on this way
Because you won't let me stay
But if you love me, you won't let me go

I tried, oh how I tried
To satisfy your foolish pride
But if you love me, you won't let me go
