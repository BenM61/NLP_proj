No New Years Day to celebrate
No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring, no song to sing
In fact, here's just another ordinary day

Just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

No April rain, no flowers' bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

Just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

No summer's high, no warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze, no falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies

Just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

No Libra sun, no Halloween
No giving thanks for all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, tho' old, so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do

Just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
