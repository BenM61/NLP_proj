Let me just take you somewhere secret
Gonna cut out of the lights down dim, forget all
About your world we gonna not flow it what we feel and share, uh
Few private thoughts, I'm not just
Out for your sex, let me simplify
The things and life that
You find complex, forget what
You heard bout me 'cause you're a
Scarecrow who think but there's no
Pressure on you 'cause you know
What you must do, check this out
Let's have a drink and I give
You time to think let me puff
This Buddha blunt and cut on
This porno bunk here come lounge
Here by my side tonight your
My devils bride and there's a
Freak deep inside have no shame
No need to high ride, do you
Keep all the shame get it all
Like thugsta she she must be
Candle tipsy on this crystal like your gypsy now I got
Her on all fours, bout to break
Down the head, boy crash this crowd
On through the wall now she howlin' like a dog swept poor
We hit the floor it don't quit
Another one break it's just another victim of Lord Infamous late night tip

I'm not the type to get involved in long relationships (Why)
Takin' trips and buyin' gifts, I'm sorry you're not on the tip (What)
If you want romance you should just stick who you already with (Ok)
If you in that means you can just hit me on that late night tip (Oh)

Some funny shh since I got in this game
They wants my crib they wants my kid since I ain't gots my thang
I never recall you askin' last boyfriend but Nathan
But now they be purple on gold
Got ya aggrivatin'
(I need a coach bag)
I can't be even doin' it
(I need my hair done)
Me too, I ain't got nothin' to do with it
I've been through with it, you and the since the first time you ask and might a add
Playas like me can't be savin' your ass

I ain't with that nonsense
All that love and dub be missed
Feelin' kind of huh
I call and all I want is sex
Slip on Victoria Secret's hit the liquor store before it close
Call Chris so I can't get somethin' white to go get up my
Never feelin' fine
Nothin' but sex is on my mind
If you cannot please me boy
Then please don't waste all of my time
Got you caught up in the mist
Mystic girl from triple
Late night tip is all we have
It's payin' so trick that sick

I can't understand why these ballas be trippin'
Can't stand the heat get out of the kitchen
Ballin' in my Lexus dropped low to the ground
Just a young playa tryin' put my bid in
Freaks want to trick that be constantly payin'
Not a girl thug they be constantly layin'
Rainbow in on a summer motel
Oh well that's where the juice man stayin'
Gotta have a lady that want to do what I do
Likes skippin' work or love cuttin' high school
Several other playas in the three 6 mafia
Camcorder on skinny dippin' in the swimmin' pool
Never try to argue, but you all fight
Kill a pack of Jimmy hand strapped pen real tight
Fillin' a lazy on top and a Bud Light
Just for your freaks on a moon like tonight

Tell me three 6 whose that bumpin' that music
Hypnotizin' Koop, I tell you who, I'm 'bout to lose it
Could it be that late night crew tight
Just inside the party
Always kind of lonely
Someone want me, hold me, I say
Come here come here come here the Koopsta cryin' tears
I can't think positive when no one cares of how I feel
Realize my mind so tired that I even tried to find
I cannot lie though I can ride hide late night
