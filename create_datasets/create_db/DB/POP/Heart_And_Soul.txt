Heart and soul
I fell in love with you
Heart and soul
The way a fool would do madly
Because you held me tight
(Held me tight) Held me tight
(Held me tight) Held me tight
(Held me tight) Held me tight
(Held me tight)
And so the kiss bear in the night

Heart and soul
I beg to be adored
Yes, and I lost control
And tumbled overboard gladly
That magic night we kissed
(That we kissed) Oh, we kissed
(That we kissed) Oh, we kissed
(That we kissed) Oh we kissed
(That we kissed)
There in the moon-mist

Oh, but your lips were thrilling
Much too much too thrilling
Never before were mine so strangely thrilling

Darling, and now I see
What one embrace can do
Come on, look at me
You've got me loving you madly
That little kiss you stole
(You stole) Oh, you stole
(You stole) Oh, you stole
(You stole) Oh, you stole
(Yes, you stole) All my heart
(You stole) and soul
(Yes, you stole) All my heart
(You stole) and soul
(Yes, you stole) Oh, you stole
(You stole) my heart
(Yes you stole) and soul...
