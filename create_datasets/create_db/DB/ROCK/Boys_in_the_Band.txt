You're walking like you never seen the light
You're walking like it every night
But I've never seen you dance,
And I've never heard you sing
So how can it mean a single thing
It's all so rudimentary

You're talking like your handy in a fight
You talk about it every night
But I've never seen your flowers,
In the barrel of a gun
All I've ever seen you do is run
It's all so rudimentary

So tell me baby how does it feel
I know you like the roll of the limousine wheel

And they all get them out for
(They all get them out)
The boys in the band
(Only for the boys in the band)
They scream and they shout for
(Twist and scream and shout)
For the boys in the band
(Only for the boys in the band)

You're walking like you never seen the light
You're walking like it every night
But I've never seen you laugh,
And I've never seen you cry
One of those things that darling you must try
It's all so rudimentary

Now I'm jealous, I'm jealous of my own
I've no homestead but through these hearts I will roam

And they all get them out for
(They all get them out)
The boys in the band
(Only for the boys in the band)
Yes they all roll them out for
(Twist and scream and shout)
The boys in the band
Only for the boys in the band

Well tell me baby how does it feel
I know you like the roll of the limousine wheel

And they all get them out for
(They all get them out)
The boys in the band
(Only for the boys in the band)
They scream and they shout for
(Twist and scream and shout)
For the boys in the band
(Only for the boys in the band)
