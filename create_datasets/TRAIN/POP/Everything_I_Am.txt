Seems only yesterday now,
Hiding my heart away
I kept my world outside
Tonight love could not be mine
Then suddenly I see you

I knew it had to be you
I feel your spirit in me
Love has saved my life

Everything I am. everything I own
Everything that's happening before my eyes
I owe it all to you

Pure is the love
Soft is the touch, you thrill
Like no one before, how could I want you more?
Like rain falls to the ocean

Like changes of the seasons
Some things are meant to be
I found myself in you

Everything I am. everything I own
Everything that's happening before my eyes
I owe it all to you
