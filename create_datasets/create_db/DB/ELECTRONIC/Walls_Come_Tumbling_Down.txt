You don't have to take this crap
You don't have to sit back and relax
You can actually try changing it
I know we've always been taught to rely
Upon those in authority,
But you never know until you try
How things just might be,
If we came together so strongly

Are you gonna try to make this work
Or spend your days down in the dirt
You see things can change,
YES an' walls can come tumbling down!

Governments crack and systems fall
'cause Unity is powerful,
Lights go out, walls come tumbling down!

The competition is a color T-V
We're on still pause with the video machine
That keep you slave to the H.P.

Until the Unity is threatened by
Those who have and who have not,
Those who are with and those who are without
And dangle jobs like a donkey's carrot,
Until you don't know where you are

Are you gonna realize
The class war's real and not mythologized
And like Jericho, You see walls can come tumbling down!

Are you gonna be threatened by
The public enemies No. 10,
Those who play the power game
They take the profits, you take the blame,
When they tell you there's no rise in pay

Are you gonna try an' make this work
Or spend your days down in the dirt,
You see things can change,
Yes an' walls can come tumbling down!
