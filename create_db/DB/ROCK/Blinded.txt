I remember things about it, hoping every day you'll call.
This can't be, I expected to see, I am human after all.
Can't believe that you were fooling, always sounded so sincere,
I can't look back, as a matter of fact, I'm still sad that you're not here.
Someone scream, it's a terrible dream, it's all a big mistake.
Now I lost that thread deep inside of my head, it's so hard to never break,
Hard to never break.

I was blinded, yes I was blinded
And the tender touch that said so much doesn't need me now.
I was blinded, how I was blinded,
When I think about how far I've got to fall
It won't help that I was blinded by it all.

Walked in with my eyes wide open, seeing what I want to see,
And I'm not so strong so I did it all wrong, now the one that hurts is me.
Can I learn to live without you, someone better tell me how.
It's understood, we were always so good, but it doesn't help me now.
Every one's there all pretending to care with a different point of view,
If a love's that real, then they'll know how it feels, and there's nothing I can do,
Nothing I can do.
I was blinded, yes I was blinded
And the tender touch that said so much doesn't need me now.
I was blinded, how I was blinded,
When I think about how far I've got to fall
It won't help that I was blinded by it all.
