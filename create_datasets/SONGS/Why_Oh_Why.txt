Do da n de da n dai (Do da n de da n dai) 
It's a feeling I got inside 
Tell me just why oh why 
Do da n de da n dai 

Sky is blue and the day is light 
I look to the sun 
I see your face and your smile is bright 
The clouds are on the run 

You ask me why I look so sad 
But I find the words to say 

Do da n de da n dai (Do da n de da n dai) 
It's a feeling i got inside 
Tell me just why oh why 
Do da n de da n dai 

You're getting close and I kiss your lips 
It never felt so strange 
I feel your soul on a different trip 
It's time to rearrange 

You ask me where all the love is gone 
but I find the words to say 

Do da n de da n dai (Do da n de da n dai) 
It's a feeling I got inside 
Tell me just why oh why 
Do da n de da n dai
