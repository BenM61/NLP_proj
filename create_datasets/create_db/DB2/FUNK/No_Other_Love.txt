No other love I'm thinkin' of
No other love can measure
No other love I'm thinkin' of
No other love can measure

Pretty little baby
You have given me good times
And all I wanna do is make it better
I could never tell you
That I didn't love you now
And no other love can compare to you

No other love I'm thinkin' of
No other love can measure
No other love I'm thinkin' of
No other love can measure

This is a matter I must confess
You're the only lover
Who can love me like no other
There's only one man
Who can give me what I need
You've got me goin' crazy
Baby, give your lovin' to me

If only you could see
That you are all I need
I can't walk away, boy
I can't walk away

No other love I'm thinkin' of
No other love can measure
No other love I'm thinkin' of
No other love can measure

No other love I'm thinkin' of
No other love can measure
No other love I'm thinkin' of
No other love can measure

Baby, it's only you I'm thinkin' of
No other love can measure
Baby, it's only you I'm thinkin' of
No other love can measure

Baby, it's only you I'm thinkin' of
No other love can measure
Baby, it's only you I'm thinkin' of
No other love can measure
