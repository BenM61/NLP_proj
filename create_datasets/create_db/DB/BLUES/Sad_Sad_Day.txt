Oh, sad, sad day
Since my baby, she went away
Oh, sad, sad day
Since my baby she went away
How long she been cheatin'
I just found it out yesterday

Oh, sad, sad day
My baby, she don't love me no more, what a shame
Oh, sad, sad day
My baby, she don't love me no more
You know I was knockin' at the front
Somebody went out of my back door

Oh, sad, sad day
My baby, she don't love me no more
Oh, sad, sad day
My baby, she don't love me no more
You know if you don't want me little girl
I pack my few rags and go

Oh, sad, sad day
Since my baby, she put me down
Oh, sad, sad day
Since my baby, she put me down
Yeah, you know my heart's been broken
I'm about to lose my doggone mind
