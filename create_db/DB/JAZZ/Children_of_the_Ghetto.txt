The children of the ghetto
Runnin' wild and free

Children of the ghetto
Runnin' wild and free
In the concrete jungle
Filled with misery
There's no inspiration
To brighten up our day
Out of desperation
I would like to say
Children of the ghetto
Keep your head
To the sky

Children of the ghetto
Always in the news
Toughness is their moto
And bitter are their blues
But deep inside the ghetto
There's a unity
Their councils are for sorrows
And no misery

Children of the ghetto
Keep your head
To the sky

Children of the ghetto
Keep your head
To the sky

Na na na na na na
Du du du du
La la la la, la la la la  

Children of the ghetto
Keep your head to the sky
Looking up, looking up to the sky

Na na na na na 

To the sky
Looking up to the sky
To the sky
la la la la la 

To the sky
To the sky
To the sky
To the sky
