On a cold December mornin'
When my demons take control
And the rain turns into thunder
Somewhere in my soul

You are the Asylum
In the madness of my day
In a world without much kindness
Somehow I always find the way

Every time I turn around
I can see your shadow
Right there on the ground
And every time I call your name

I can hear a voice that I can't explain
When I find myself in a faceless crowd
I know you're right behind me baby
Every time I turn around

In the struggle for survival
Every day becomes a year
How to keep a cool perspective
Isn't always very clear

I need all the shelter
Your lovin' can provide
Like a bridge across the raging river
Take me to the other side

Every time I turn around
I can see your shadow
Right there on the ground
And every time I call your name

I can hear a voice that I can't explain
When I find myself in a faceless crowd
I know you're right behind me
Baby, every time I turn around
Every time I turn around

If an ocean stands between us
And my heart begins to pound
I know you're right behind me baby
Every time I turn around

Every time I turn around
I can see your shadow
Right there on the ground
And every time I call your name

I can hear a voice that I can't explain
When I find myself in a faceless crowd
I know you're right behind me
Baby, every time I turn around
