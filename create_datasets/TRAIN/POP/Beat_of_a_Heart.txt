The heat of the sun
Was a little too much today
Love on the wing
Flew so high it just melted away

So sweet on the run
So little time to make you see
What can't be undone
Was maybe never meant to be

But sometimes a fool
Gets lucky and wins
Sometimes the innocent pay
For an old man's sin

But when the amber light
Of daylight's gone
All I want to feel
Is the beat of a heart

The street that night
Had a little too much to say
And the look in your eyes
It was a little too far away

But sometimes a fool
Gets lucky and wins
Sometimes the innocent pay
For an old man's sin
Sometimes a fool
Gets lucky and wins
Sometimes the innocent pay
For an old man's sin

But when the amber light
Of daylight's gone
All I want to feel
Is the beat of a heart
Just a little life ticking away
The beat of a heart
You come take me far away (Musical Break)

Sometimes a fool
Gets lucky and wins
Sometimes the innocent pay
For an old man's sin

But when the tears are dark
And we stand as one
All I want to feel
And when the amber light
Of daylight's gone
All I want to hear
Is the beat of a heart
The beat of a heart
You come and take me far away
