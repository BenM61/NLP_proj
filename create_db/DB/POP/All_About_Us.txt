Take my hand
I'll teach you to Dance
I'll spin you around
Won't let you fall down

Would you let me lead?
You can step on my feet
Give it a try
It'll be alright

The room's hush hush
And now is our moment
Take it in
Feel it all
And hold it
Eyes on you
Eyes on me
We're doin' this right

'Cause lovers dance when they're feelin' in love
Spotlight's shinin' it's all about us
It's all about us
And every heart in the room will melt
This is a feeling I've never felt but
It's all about us

Suddenly,
I'm feeling brave
I don't know what's got into me
Why I feel this way
Can we dance
Real slow?
Can I hold you
Can I hold you close?

The room's hush hush
And now is our moment
Take it in
Feel it all
And hold it
Eyes on you
Eyes on me
We're doin' this right

'Cause lovers dance when they're feelin' in love
Spotlight's shinin' it's all about us
It's all about us
And every heart in the room will melt
This is a feeling I've never felt but
It's all about us

Do you hear that, love?
They're playin' our song

Do you think we're ready?
Oh I'm really feelin' it

Do you hear that, love?
Do you hear that, love?

Do you hear that, love?
Do you hear that, love?

Do you hear that, love?
Do you hear that, love?

Lovers dance when they're feeling in love
Spotlight's shining
it's all about us (It's all about us)
it's all about us
(do you hear that, love?)

Every heart in the room will melt
This is a feeling I've never felt but
It's all about us

'Cause lover's dance when they're feeling in love
Spotlight's shining it's all about us
It's all about us
Every heart in the room will melt
This is a feeling I've never felt but
It's all
It's all about us.
