Free the, free hippo
Free the, free hippo
Be the free hippo

La, la, la, hippo
La, la, la, hippo
Free the, free hippo

Waiting for it to rain
(I'm telling you)
Waiting for it to rain
Waiting for it to rain
(I'm telling you)
Hope it's gonna rain

Some one's dying
You aren't cryin'
I'm gonna show my heart rate rapid

In every way, in every route
In every way, in every route
In every way

He is comin'
Show our garden
I'm gonna tell my heart rate rapid

In every route, in every route
In every route, in every route
In every route

Free the, free hippo
Free the, free hippo
Be the free hippo
Be the free hippo

La, la, la, hippo
La, la, la, hippo
Free the, free hippo
Free the, free hippo

Waiting for it to rain
(I'm tellin' you)
Waiting for it to rain
Waiting for it to rain
(I'm telling you)
Hope it's gonna rain

You are dying
Aren't you cryin'
I'm gonna show your heart rate rapid

In every way
In every way
In every way
In every way

In every way
In every way
In every way
In every way

In every way
In every way
In every way
In every way

In every way
In every way
In every way

In every way
In every way
In every way
In every way
