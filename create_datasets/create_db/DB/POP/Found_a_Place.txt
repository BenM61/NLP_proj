I've found a place where I can go
I've found a place that's holy
I've found a place where You are no long reaching for me
I've found a place that's close to you
I've found a place that's close to me
I've found a place where You are and that's where I want to be

And You'll find me at Your feet
And You'll find me kneeling
And You'll find me near or far
You will find me where You are

I've found a place where I can hide
I've found a place that gives me strength
I've found a place where I am sevant and You're the King
I've found a place that I call home
I've found a place that I know well
I've found a place where I am less and You're everything

And You'll find me at Your feet
And You'll find me kneeling
And You'll find me near or far
You will find me where You are
I've traveled far with tired feet
And ended here on bended knee
Asking for some sympathy
And you rescued me

I've found a place where I can rest
I've found a place of sweet relief
I've found a place where I can hear You whisper to me
I see the writing on the wall
I realize that after all is said and done
That You are holding eternity

And You'll find me at Your feet
And You'll find me kneeling
And You'll find me near or far
You will find me where You are
