I can see you when the rains come
In a flood of memory
And I go back
To that place where love was new
To those days of me and you
We thought would never end...
Remember September
And the promise of love we made
Believing forever
Nothing in this world would ever change
Everything we felt would stay the same...

Can you see me like you once did
Can I touch you like before
'Cause I need you
Even more than I did then
Put your kisses on my skin
Forever in my soul...

Remember September
And the promise of love we made
Believing forever
Nothing in this world would ever change
Everything we felt would stay the same

Ooh my love...
I still want you...
Ooh my love...

Remember September
And the promise of love we made
Believing forever
Nothing in this world would ever change
Everything we felt would stay the same...
