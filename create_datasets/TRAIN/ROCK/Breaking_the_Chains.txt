Sit there thinkin'
In your room
You feel the pressure
You're goin' crazy too
The walls around you
Closin' in
You need a change

Claustophobic
Feelin' scared
You need somebody
But no one seems to care
A one way ticket
A change of pace
You've had enough
Can't take no more

Breaking the chains around you
Nobody else can bind you
Take a good look around you
Now you're breaking the chains

Got this letter
Came today
From my baby
Who left me yesterday
Said she loves me
She'll come back
She wants to try

I won't let her
She'll be upset
I know it's better
Than somethin' I'll regret
She's been dishonest
And insincere
I lost my mind
Twenty times a year

Breaking the chains around you
Nobody else can bind you
Take a good look around you
Now you're breaking the chains
Breaking the chains around me
Nobody else can bind me
Take a good look around me
Now I'm breaking the chains

(Solo)

Woke up today
I'm alone
I look around
But baby you were gone
But I don't mind
And I don't worry
I will survive

I'm alone
Now that you're gone
Don't need nobody
To hold or tie me down
I broke the chains
So let me be
I've gotta be free

Breaking the chains around you
Nobody else can bind you
Take a good look around you
Now you're breaking the chains
Breaking the chains around you
Nobody else can bind you
Take a good look around you
Now you're breaking the chains
