Every time I'm walkin' down the streets 
Some pretty mama stop breakin' down with me 
Stop breakin' down, yes stop breakin' down 
The stuff I got'll bust your brains out, baby 
Ooh, it'll make you lose your mind 

I can't walk the streets now, can't consulate my mind 
Some no good woman she starts breakin' down 
Stop breakin' down, please stop breakin' down 
The stuff I got'll bust your brains out, baby 
Ooh, it'll make you lose your mind 

Now, you Saturday night womens, you love to ape and clown 
You won't do nothin' but tear a good man reputation down 
Stop breakin' down, please stop breakin' down 
The stuff I got'll bust your brains out, baby 
Ooh, it'll make you lose your mind 

Now, I give my baby, now the 99 degree 
She jumped up and throwed a pistol down on me 
Stop breakin' down, please stop breakin' down 
Stuff I got'll bust your brains out, baby 
Ooh, it'll make you lose your mind 

I can't start walkin' down the streets 
But my pretty mama don't start breakin' down with me 
Stop breakin' down, yeah stop breakin' down 
The stuff I got'll bust your brains out, baby 
Ooh, it'll make you lose your mind
