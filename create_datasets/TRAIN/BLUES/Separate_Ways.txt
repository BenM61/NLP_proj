What is it that you want from me?
I really wish I knew.
I try so hard to do my best,
but it's not good enough for you.
Over and over again
we will make the same mistakes.
Over and over again
there's a feelin' I just can't shake.
Is it time to go our separate ways?
Is it time to go our separate ways?
You know I need your love so bad.
Can't you see what you do to me?
I try so hard to understand,
but the truth's never plain to see.
Is it time to go our separate ways?
Is it time to go our separate ways?
Time after time we will try to understand.
I don't know where we went wrong,
but there's no use in holdin' on.
Over and over again
we will make the same mistakes.
Over and over again
and it's more than a man can take.
Is it time to go our separate ways?
Is it time to go our separate ways?
Is it time to go our separate ways?
Is it time to go our separate ways?
