I could tell you that her eyes could outshine any star
That she looks like an angel but you'd think I'd gone too far
Tell you that her lips burn like the desert sand
No matter what I say, you would never understand

I can't tell you how she makes me feel
All I know is what we have is real
Words can't describe our love
That I'll say for sure
But if you can picture perfect
You can picture her

I could tell you that her heart is made of solid gold
That I'm a lucky man for having her to hold
Tell you that her touch could drive a man insane
But what's the use of talkin' 'bout something I can't explain

I can't tell you how she makes me feel
All I know is what we have is real
Words can't describe our love
That I'll say for sure
But if you can picture perfect
You can picture her

Every little thing she does makes me love her that much more
And every night when I come home I walk through heaven's door

I can't tell you how she makes me feel
All I know is what we have is real
Words can't describe our love
That I'll say for sure
But if you can picture perfect
You can picture her

If you can picture perfect
You can picture
You can picture her
