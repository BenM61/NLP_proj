I think about it baby all the time, all right
It feels so good it must be a crime, all right
I want to do it baby every day, all right
In a bed, on the stairs, anywhere, all right
I want to do it baby all the time, all right
'Cause when we do it girl, it's so divine, all right

I could be guilty for my honesty, all right
But I've got to tell you what you mean to me, all right (all right)
With you I swear, I'm a maniac, all right
You see it ain't no joke, just a natural fact, all right, all right

I want to do it baby all the time, all right (ooh ooh)
'Cause when we do it girl, it's so divine, all right

Doin' it, doin' it, doin' it, doin' it

(Come on)
(Come on)

I could be guilty for my honesty, all right
(But I've got to) I've got to tell you what you mean to me, all right

(Yeah, I wanna)

I wanna do it baby all the time, all right, yeah
'Cause when we do it girl, it's so divine, all right

I wanna do it baby all the time, all right, eh
'Cause when we do it girl, it's so divine, all right

I wanna do you baby all the time, all right
'Cause when we do it girl, it's so divine, all right

(You wanna) think about it, (you wanna) think about it (baby, all the time)
Think about it all the time (fuckin' on your mind)
Feels so good it must be a crime

Woo, woo, woo
Doin' it (doin' it), doin' it (doin' it), doin' it (doin' it), doin' it (doin' it), ooh, ooh, ooh
Come on
Come on
Come on
