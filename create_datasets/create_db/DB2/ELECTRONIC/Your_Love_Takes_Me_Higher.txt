Baby, well let me tell you something about love.
Let me tell you that I've had enough.
I've had enough of your playing away,
And I've only got one thing to say...

Only your love takes me higher.
It's the kind of love that leaves me burning with desire.
If you think of me, if you care,
Stop your fooling 'round because it's going nowhere.

Baby, well let me tell you the one thing that's true.
I've got to try to get through to you.
I've had enough of your playing away,
And now I've only got one thing to say...

Only your love takes me higher.
It's the kind of love that leaves me burning with desire.
If you think of me, if you care,
Stop your fooling 'round because it's going nowhere.

Ask me, I will recommend
Something that will surely put your troubles at an end.
All this heartache's more than I can bear.
It's still going nowhere, nowhere.

Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere, nowhere...
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere, nowhere...

Only your love takes me higher.
It's the kind of love that leaves me burning with desire.
If you think of me, if you care,
Stop your fooling 'round because it's going nowhere.

Ask me, I will recommend
Something that will surely put your troubles at an end.
All this heartache's more than I can bear.
It's still going nowhere, nowhere.

It's the kind of love that leaves me burning with desire.
Stop your fooling 'round because it's going nowhere.
Something that will surely put your troubles at an end.
