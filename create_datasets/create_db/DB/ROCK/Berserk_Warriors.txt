Bjorn is just a viking 
He is very a handy with a sword
He loves nothing better
Than to cut and slash right through a horde
Mutilation, jubilation
Friendly muscles, in a tussle

Anna's a girl viking 
She is very handy with a spear
She won't wear silk stockings 
Armour-plated garments are her sphere
In the fjords, you can hear them
Eerie horns blow, viking love show 

Bjorn and Anna earn their leisure
They have each other for their pleasure

Bjorn is on his long ship
He and Anna fought it out today
He says it is their Waterloo
Vikings shouldn't mix their work and play

All that blonde hair for them to share
So much plunder, Cut asunder 
Now when Bjorn and Anna see each other
It's on the battlefield, not as lovers 

Those vikings love to fight and play 
Fighting berserk warriors hey hey! 
Those vikings love to fight and play 
Fighting berserk warriors hey hey! 
Those vikings love to fight and play 
Fighting berserk warriors hey hey!
