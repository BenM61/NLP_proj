As I was walking down the street
A pretty girl did I meet
She's looking all so sweet
Got a major from her head to her feet

I was looking back to see
If she was looking back to see
If I was looking back at her

She glowed with such a beautiful smile
She must have been a beautiful child
Man she was all so neat
A major from her head to her feet

I was looking back to see
If she was looking back to see
If I was looking back at her

Her hair was curly shining bright
Her shoes in black were just delight
She wore the very best of clothes
And also black and nylon hose

I was looking back to see
If she was looking back to see
If I was looking back at her

As I was walking down the street

She was looking back
I was looking back at her

I was looking back to see
If she was looking back to see
