At the dark end of the street
That is where we always meet
Hiding in shadows where we don't belong
Living in darkness, to right our wrong
You and me, at the dark end of the street
You and me

I know a time has gonna take it's toll
We have to pay for the love we stole
It's a sin and we know it's wrong
But, our love keeps going on strong
Steal away to the dark end of the street

They're gonna find us, they're gonna find us
Someday they may come along and find us love someday
You and me, at the dark end of the street
You and me

When the daylight hour rolls around
And if by chance we're both taken in taken down the town
But if we should leave before then and just walk on by
Oh sweet baby please don't you cry
Because tonight we'll share the same dream at the dark end of the street
You and me
You and me
You and me
At the dark end of the street
