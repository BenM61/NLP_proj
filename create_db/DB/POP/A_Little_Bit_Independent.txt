A little bit independent in your walk
A little bit independent in your talk
There's nothing like you in Paris or New York
You're awfully easy on the eyes

A little bit independent when we dance
A little bit independent toward romance
A bit of sophistication in your glance
And yet you're easy on the eyes

Whenever I'm with you alone
You weave a magic spell
And though it be a danger zone
I only know that you're swell

A little bit independent with your smile
A little bit independent in your style
But how can I help but love you all the while
When you're so easy on the eyes
