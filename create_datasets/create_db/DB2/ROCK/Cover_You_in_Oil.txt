I like to slip into something good
I see a young girl in the neighborhood
The way she move, I must confess
I like to run my hands up and down her legs
The way she dress, she look so fine
I'll make her wet, I'll make her mine        (Gonna make her mine)
She like it hard, she like it slow           (She don't like it slow)
All right honey, come on lets go          

Baby, what you want, it's the way she move   (Baby, feel what you want)
Feel what you need, come on let's go         (Baby, feel what you need)

Cover you in oil 
I want to cover you in oil                     (Let me cover you in oil)
Let me cover you in oil                      (I want to cover you in oil)
Cover you in oil                             (Let me cover you in oil)
(Yeah)
Pull on the zip, she give good lip service
It's nothing for the show, I just pay to see her go
She make you hot, you spray your lot
(So) Comin' in honey, we're headin' to the top
The way she push, don't give a dime          (she don't give a dime)
Abuse your life, gonna make you satisfied
She's kinda rough, she give it tough
Come on honey and strut your stuff

Baby (feel) what you want, it's the way she move
(Baby,) Feel what you need, come on let's go

Cover you in oil
