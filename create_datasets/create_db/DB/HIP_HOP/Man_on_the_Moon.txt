I never gave a f*ck
I never a f*ck about what niggas thought about me
I mean I did but like f*ck it you know'm sayin
You gon' love me man
You gon' love me man

They can't comprehend
Or even come close to understanding him
I guess if I was borin' they would love me more
Guess if I was simple in the mind
Everything would be fine
Maybe if I was jerk to girls
Instead of being nice and speakin' kind words
Then maybe it would be OK to say then
I wasn't a good guy to begin with

But my mind is all crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
They got me thinkin I ain't human,
Like I came in from above, above, above, above
Feelin like a airplane in the sky
But then they say I'm crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
They got me thinkin I ain't human,
Like I came in from above, above, above, above
Feelin' like a bird sittin' high high

I be that man on the moon
I'm that man on the moon
And i'm a do what I do
so do you hey hey
I be posted with my blunt and a brew my dude
I'm that man on the moon
I'm up up on the moon

Its like I,
I'm a play my stuff for everybody
And you know all my people
Give me feedback
you know and they'll be like
yo, yo, why, why your shit sound so different
Know'm saying why why your shit like on 'nother level
why it sound so diffrenet like its bad thing
And i be like why not?
Nigga, haha

Close my eyes, hide in the dark
It's a curtain call, come one come all
All I do is try to make it simple
The ones that make it complicated
Never get congratulated
I'm somethin' different in all aspects
Don't want a woman just to love her assets
I still wife her up even with her flat chest
The type to get hurt
But that's the past tense

My mind is all hazy, hazy, hazy, hazy
I be thinkin' that I'm bomb,
'cause they used to call me lame, lame, lame, lame
But my swagg was a little different
But then my mind is hazy, hazy, hazy, hazy
I be thinkin that I'm wrong,
But they the ones who blame, blame, blame, blame
I got the last laugh nigga

I be that man on the moon
I'm that man on the moon
And i'm a do what I do
so do you hey hey
I be posted with my blunt and a brew my dude
I'm that man on the moon
I'm up up on the moon
