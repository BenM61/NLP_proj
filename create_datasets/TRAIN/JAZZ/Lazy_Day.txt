Blue sky, sunshine
What a day to take a walk in the park
Ice cream, daydream
Till the sky becomes a blanket of stars

What a day for a pickin' daisies
And lots of red balloons
And what a day for holdin' hands
And bein' with you

Lazy day just right for lovin' away
Lazy day made for a stroll in the lane
Baby you and me
And a honey bee
Lazy day, lazy day
Lazy day for you and me

Blue sky, sunshine
Flowers bloomin', squirrels are sayin' hello
Rowboats, bird notes
People smilin' everywhere that we go

What a day to be together
And what a sky of blue
And what a day for thinkin' right out loud
I love you

Lazy day just right for lovin' away
Lazy day made for a stroll in the lane
Baby you and me
'Neath a shady tree
Lazy day, lazy day
Lazy day for you and me

And what a day for thinkin' right out loud
I love you

Lazy day just right for lovin' away
Lazy day made for a stroll in the lane
Lazy day just right for lovin' away
Lazy day
