The sun went down and the ground started sort of grinding
A blinding light tore across the sky
A cyclone swept the landscape out
And left it completely flattened out
And several twirls of smoke unfolded like gigantic flowers

The way the morning broke was quite unusual

I should have wakened up at once,
But this was no concern of mine,
So I kept on dreaming

My eyes roamed over the burning ruins

In less time than it takes to tell

And I felt like
And I felt like being numbed,
I felt like mesmerized

The way the morning broke was quite unusual
More than words can say

In less time than it takes to tell
