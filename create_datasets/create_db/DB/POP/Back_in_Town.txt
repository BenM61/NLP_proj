It seems just like yesterday when we were standing here
Yankee's hat upon my head and your voice in my ear
As I talked about the future and all the things we'd do
I never thought your lovin' words would frighten me from you

I remember when I sold my car to board that train
You said you were sure that I would not come back again
And now you see with your own eyes and start to realize
I'm not the man I thought I was so try to sympathize

The way you think about your life
Is gonna change, change tonight
Don't even try out that frown
'cause your man is back in town

I'm sure you've been thinkin' 'bout just where the hell I've been'
Painted your own pictures of the trouble I got in
There were times I will admit my heart saw better days
But I'm the type that has to lose to find I had it made

No use talkin' too much about things we cannot change
I know you think it's crazy but I'm here to set things straight
I'm standing here to say that I'll give love a try
It's my complicated way to say I'll simplify

The way you think about your life
Is gonna change, change tonight
Don't even try out that frown
'cause you man is back in town

Baby, it's cool to take your time
I was a fool out of my mind
So let's jump off of this merry-go-round
'cause your man is back in town

I was drawn away, now I'm back to stay
I was wrong to think there was a better way
Now I see with my own eyes, 'bout time I realize
I hope in time you will forgive, I'll never leave your side

The way you think about your life
Is gonna change, change tonight
Don't even try out that frown
'cause you man is back in town

Baby, it's cool to take your time
I was a fool out of my mind
So let's jump off of this merry-go-round
'cause your man is back in town
So let's jump off of this merry-go-round
'cause your man is back in town
