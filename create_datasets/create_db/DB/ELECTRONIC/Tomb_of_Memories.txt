When a man had a thing to say
Sometimes words never come his way
Strong enough to transact something physical.

All the ways that a head can find
To evolve a picture from a state of mind.
You never seems to mean the same to every guy. something physical

Words can be found and twisted round.
Words are no substitute when it seems if we're locked in a room
That's a tomb of memories.

The hurt it don't stop
The hurt it don't stop
The hurt it don't stop memories

Simple words from a simple man
Can see more than the learning head.
They turn emotion into something physical, yeh. something physical

Words can be found and twisted round.
Words are no substitute when it seems if we're locked in a room
That's a tomb of memories.

The hurt it don't stop
The hurt it don't stop
The hurt it don't stop
The hurt it don't stop
The hurt it don't stop memories

The hurt it don't stop
The hurt it don't stop
