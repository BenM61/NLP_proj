When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you 
I'll take your part, oh, when darkness comes
And pain is all, is all around
Just like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Just like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

Sail on, silver girl
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All of your dreams are on their way
See how they shine
Oh, if you ever need a friend
Look around I'm sailing right behind
Just like a bridge over troubled water
I'll be there to lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
