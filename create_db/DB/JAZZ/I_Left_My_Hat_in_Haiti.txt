I left my hat in Haiti
In some forgotten flat in Haiti
I couldn't tell you how I got there
I only know it was so hot there

She took my hat politely
And wound her arms around me tightly
But I remember nothing clearly
Except the flame when she came near me

Her eyes had the glow of surrender
And her touch it was tender
And with someone as fiery as that
You forget about your hat

So if you go to Haiti
There is a girl I know in Haiti
If you can find her you'll adore her
Just look around till you've found someone who has a blue-grey fedora
