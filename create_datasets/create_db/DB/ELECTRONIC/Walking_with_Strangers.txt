Look around for a means to dissuade her attention
Can't remember the places or names that she mentions

My words are falling apart in spite of me
I'm stepping out of the light so she can't see
Don't think I'll miss her but I want to take her picture
When I've found a place where she can't find me

And she's falling asleep as she's walking with strangers
Talking cheap as the flies on the wall entertain her

Her world is falling apart in front of me
She's stepping into the light but she can't see
It's hard to miss her when she's posing for a picture
But I've found a place where she can't find me

My words are falling apart in spite of me
I'm stepping out of the light so she can't see
Don't think I'll miss her but I want to take her picture
When I've found a place where she can't find me
