It's another night in

Rats are in the kitchen, scratchin'
Whisperin' my name and laughin'
Edgin' up the hall into my bed
Faces on the walls are screamin'
Driftin' out across the ceilin'
Droppin' off and fallin' in my head

All alone they cut the phones
But then again there's no one left to ring
There's gonna be no peace
'Til the bones break through my skin

Another night in, another night in
I shiver within, a slow hand clap begins
Another night in, another night in
Woah, my skeleton is waitin' in the wings
Of a skeleton grin, oh no
'Cause I don't know where he stops and I begin

A hundred million bugs are crawlin'
In and out of every openin'
Up and down and over me all night
Lookin' through my old scrapbook
I search in vain for pleasant memory
Tearin' out my hair 'til it gets light

All alone, I'm heard to groan
My epitaph, I regret everythin'
There's gonna be no sleep 'til the bones
Break through my skin

Another night in, another night in
I shiver within, a slow hand clap begins
Another night in, another night in
Woah, my skeleton is eager in the wings
Of a skeleton grin, oh no
And I don't know where he stops and I begin

It's just another night in, another night in
I shiver within, a slow hand clap begins
Another night in, another night in
Woah, my skeleton is waitin' in the wings
Of another night in, just another night in
Woah, another night in

Watchin' the wildlife drift by on the outside
Watchin' the movement on my bit of sky
Watchin' my face disappear in the mirror
All in the name of another night in

Woah, another night in, woah, another night in
Oh no no, this skeleton thing
Feelin' the pain of another night in
