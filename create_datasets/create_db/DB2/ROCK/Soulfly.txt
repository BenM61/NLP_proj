I am what I create 
Believing in my fate 
Integrity is my name 
All that I am doing 
Can never be ruined 
My song remains insane 

Eye for an eye 
Got to watch my back 
Got to let my heart 
Believe one day I'll fly

To reunite the tribe 
To find a better way 
Fucking envy changes everything 
I hit the bottom 
You don't understand 
Pain, hate, pain

To be born again 
Arise again 
I believe is the only way
