Let Me Be The One 
Baby, listen to me please
I've been dreamin' 'bout you every night
Now that you are here with me

All I want to do is hold you tight
Now take me in your arms
I've waited for so long
Let me be the one

Ooh, please don't deny my heart
Everything I want
Let me be the one
Baby, if you only knew

All the times I've loved you in ym mind
And if you let my dreams come true
I promise you it?s gonna feel alright
Oh, now take me in your arms

I've waited for so long
Let me be the one
Ooh, please don't deny my heart
Everything I want

Let me be the one
Now take me in your arms
I've waited for so long
Let me be the one

Baby, please don't deny my heart
Everything I want
Let me be the one
Oh, baby

Oh... oh... oh... oh... baby
Let me be the one
