Six AM, Las Vegas
In a suite, yeah, I got bitches on the way

And she on ecstasy, so she fucking all night
All night, yeah, she fucking all night

'Cause nigga, I don't give a f*ck
I be so dosed, smoking that dope, ain't no telling what's in my cup
You ain't putting nothing on nothing, my nigga, so you should just shut the f*ck up
You ain't been rolling nothing, I'm trying to stuff seven grams up in my blunt
My Backwood like a back, gotta roll it off a flat
She started off on her knees, she gonna end up on her back
She mixing the Xan with the Purp'
Noddin' off, look like she breaking her neck
I gotta treat that ass like a lateral, she steady throwing it back
Mixing the Kush with the Purp', that's how you smoke when you rich
I drop a bean in the lean, that's how you get high as shit
Mixing the dark with the white and bubbly, we gon' just call it a twist
I'ma just pass that lil' bitch to my bro, we gonna call that an assist

F*ck a bitch, black or she white
Older bitch might be from Canada
Give me her cheese like a manager
Her nigga a lame, he can't handle her
She gave me brain on the camera
Smoke weed but got stamina
Gin turn me into an animal
Don't Snapchat me that pussy, I want it for real
She claim that she ain't fucking, but she know the deal
Got bars like a jail
Got pounds on a scale
F*ck a broad and don't tell
She only get Taco Bell
Niggas buying they own coffin, they just need the nail
I turn on the TV and watch the KK sail
Wake up in the morning and roll me some joints, put them all in the air
Just pour me up some drinks I'm about to

Mix the weed with the drank and let's have a good night

And she on ecstasy, so she fucking all night
All night, yeah, she fucking all night

You got that Xan' and lean, she gon' f*ck you on sight
When she wake up from her, I'ma give her all pipe
And that pussy ain't that good, that shit was just alright
Had to call my homie and tell him that it just all hype
And that bitches gave me dome and it took all night
And that sloppy ain't toppy, she didn't hold the balls right
She just wanna do drugs and smoke my weed up all night
So I kicked that bitch out and told her, bust a hard right
See, she a cutie with a booty but she don't know what she doin'
So I had to stop her, tell that bitch to keep it movin'
Money right in front of her, but she don't know what she viewin'
Put a milli' in her mouth but she don't know what she chewin'
