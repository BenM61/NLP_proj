Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?
Will it be the same if I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on
'Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven

Would you hold my hand if I saw you in heaven?
Would you help me stand if I saw you in heaven?
I'll find my way through night and day
'Cause I know I just can't stay here in heaven

Time can bring you down
Time can bend your knees
Time can break your heart
Have you begging please, begging please

If I saw you
Beyond the door there's peace I'm sure
And I know there'll be no more tears in heaven

Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?
Will it be the same if I, if I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on
'Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven
Heaven, heaven, no, no, no, here in heaven
