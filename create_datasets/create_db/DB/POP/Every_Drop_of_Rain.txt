Every Drop Of Rain
They say there will be rain tonight,
But that's okay, we'll stay inside,
This is the first time I have felt so satisfied,
I know love has found me;

And now the night, is getting wild,
And she is sleeping like a child,
And though I know, I know I should be dreaming,
I'm tossing and turning, 'cause I wonder,

Yes I wonder, how it began,
Growing in the forests and the freeways,
Minute by minute she became a part of me,
And suddenly love is here and I'm falling,

Just like every drop of rain,
Many drops can someday make a river,
And many rivers go down to the sea,
And the sea rolls on forever, forever;

And now I'll sleep till morning light,
I have no fear of stormy nights,
Because the one that I have wanted all my life,
Is right here beside me, and I wonder,

Oh the wonder, how it began,
Growing in the forests and the freeways,
Minute by minute she became a part of me,
And suddenly love is here and I'm falling,

Just like every drop of rain,
Many drops can someday make a river,
And many rivers go down to the sea,
And the sea rolls on forever,

Oh oh every drop of rain
