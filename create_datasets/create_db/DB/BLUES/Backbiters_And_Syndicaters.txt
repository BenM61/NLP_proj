Back biters and syndicators
Standing all around the door

An' it wished 'bout ev'ryday
Hopin' I'd go way to stay

Ooo-wee-ooo
Almost ruin my happy home

That you don't know they don't mean you no good
You'll find these kind-a people
In any neighborhood

Back biters and syndicators
Can't you see 'em standin' 'round the do'?
Back biters and the syndicator
Can't you see 'em standin' 'round the do'?
