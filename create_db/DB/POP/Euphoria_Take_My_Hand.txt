Heartbreak, I'm not holding your hand any more
Why can't you understand?
Euphoria, take my hand
Euphoria

Your ways, my ways
Never, always
The future, the past
The first, the last

Heartbreak, I'm not holding your hand any more
Why can't you understand?
Euphoria, take my hand
Euphoria

Right time, wrong line
Myself, I'm alien
I swear to god, lies and bad thoughts
1, 2, 3, 4, let go

Heartbreak, I'm not holding your hand any more
Why can't you understand?
Euphoria, take my hand
Euphoria

I wish upon a falling star
I feel, never felt, I hit
You hit me, sunshine a liking to our evil evening
Heartbreak, I'm not holding your hand anymore

Heartbreak, I'm not holding your hand, let me go
Why can't you understand?
Why can't you understand?
Why can't you understand?

Euphoria, take my hand
Euphoria, take my hand
Euphoria, take my hand
Euphoria

Euphoria
Take my hand
Euphoria
Take my hand
