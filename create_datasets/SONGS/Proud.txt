When my strength was gone, and I just gave up on life
In my darkest place you were my guide
And you told me that I should live my life to the limit
When you fall down get back up and fight
Well the shape of my heart don't lie
I'm determined when you trust in me
It's all I need

Now I'm hoping, if you hear this
You believe that all that I do is to make you proud
Make me stronger, so that I rise up
Made my mind up
So that all that I do is to make you proud
Proud, proud, make you proud, proud
Proud, proud, make you proud, proud
All that I do is to make you proud

I never gave up then cause you said keep hope alive
The champion gives one last try
Said I deserve the best in life
I should be winning
Gotta spread your wings and prepare to fly

Well the shape of my heart don't lie
I'm determined with your faith in me
To make you see

Now I'm hoping, if you hear this
You believe that all that I do is to make you proud
Make me stronger, so that I rise up
Made my mind up
All that I do is to make you proud
Proud, proud, make you proud, proud
Proud, proud, make you proud, proud
All that I do is to make you proud

Nobody can tell me they were there for me
Before you came around
There was pain in every heart beat
But eventually you built my reserve to be strong
Now I'm hoping, if you hear this
You believe that all that I do is to make you proud

Now I'm hoping, if you hear this
You believe that all that I do is to make you proud
Make me stronger, so that I rise up
Made my mind up

All that I do is to make you proud
Proud, proud, make you proud, proud
Proud, proud, make you proud, proud
All that I do is to make you proud

Proud, proud, make you proud, proud
Proud, proud, make you proud, proud
All that I do is to make you proud
