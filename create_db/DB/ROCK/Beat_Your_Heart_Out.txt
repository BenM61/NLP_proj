Baby you make my heart beat faster
Baby you make my heart beat faster
I know let alone to rust alone
You're making me
I had to run the damage is done
I give it up
Thee nothing left take the rest
You're draining me

Me I set it light it burns so bright
Stab it out
Stab it out

Baby you make my heart beat faster
Baby you make my heart beat faster

I know, I know, I know
I had to run the damage is done
I give it up
I had to go
It got control
You're breaking me
There's nothing left so take the rest
Stab it out
Stab it out
I set it light
It burns so bright
You're draining me

You make my heart beat faster
Baby you make my heart beat faster

I know, I know, that it's true
Let alone rust alone
Let alone rust alone
Let alone rust alone

Baby you make my heart beat faster
Baby you make my heart beat fast
Baby you make my heart beat faster

There's nothing so take the rest
There's nothing so take the rest
There's nothing so take the rest
There's nothing so take the rest
There's nothing so take the rest

Baby you make my heart beat faster
Baby you make my heart beat faster

Baby you make my heart beat faster
Baby you make my heart beat faster
