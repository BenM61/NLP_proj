Savoy, the home of sweet romance
Savoy, it wins you at a glance
Savoy, gives happy feet a chance to dance.

Your form, just like a clingin' vine
Your lips, as warm and sweet as wine
Your cheek, so soft and close to mine, divine.

How my heart is singin'
While the band is swingin'
Never tired of rompin'
An' Stompin' with you at the Savoy

What joy, a perfect holiday
Savoy, where we can glide and sway
There let me stomp away with you

Savoy,
Savoy,
Savoy.

Your form just like a clingin' vine
Your lips, as warm and sweet as wine
Your cheek, so soft and close to mine, divine.

Oh, how my heart is singin'
While the band is swingin'
Never tired of rompin'
An' Stompin' with you at the Savoy

What joy,
Savoy,
Savoy, there let me stomp away
With you.
