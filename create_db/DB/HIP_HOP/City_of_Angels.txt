They all are yellin' out freeze
As I'm on these backstreets gettin' mine
Dodgin' the law, dodgin' it sublime
And if you feel me, I'm a keep it real for this episode

Makin' you raw and do some critical overload
What must I do to live in the City of Angels?
Like a fucker, who unclockin' the chamber
'Cause it remains to be the same to me
I gotta be an OG like my daddy and my grand peppy

Don't ever touch mine, don't ever disrespect mine
Better get out to protect in case you ever cross the line
Yo, I'm like the crow, no dumb birdy
As I handle my business and as I take you on the journey

It ain't no City of the Angels, brother Mack
It's just people playin' get back and more get back
Yo, a lotta drama on my block, but I never stress
Because I'm build like a Presidential Rolex

A lotta people got over the red, over the blue
A lotta people hustle 'cause they got to
But if I ever go out before I'm supposed to go
I'm gonna revenge myself like The Crow

L.A. is sure a crazy ass place to stay
Where the riders ride and the players play
I've been around the world and around the way
24-7 like everyday

I see the clock struck half past
I'm movin' fast with a blast
I'm like an angel in the city with the devil's path
And everybody's out to get me
So I quickly stick and move
And if he moves I trip, my fingers itch

I got a vision, I'm on a mission, listen
I can hear 'em, but I can't trust my intuition
I'm wishin' upon that midnight mystical
And through the darkness I'm hopin' for a miracle

I can't holler 'till you hear me
I gotta get me through the madness
Even though I'm guilty
And as I reload I'm all alone, set to explode
Like an unlogical murderer that's in the zone

I know they workin', the spirit's lurkin', I'm hurtin'
The triple six with the kiss got my soul searchin'
Then I woke and I choked on a cloud of smoke
It was a dream and in my dream I'd seen a black crow

Another day in L.A. comes to an end
The dark of the night starts to set in
Lots of deals goin' down under the city lights

Welcome to the city of drag where my pants sag
And the homies still relyin' on the flag
Yeah, life starts to twist and turn
Then they hit you at another angle
Just some more drama in the City of Angels

Violence is brought forth too many years
Fuckin' memories, we cried so many tears
Oh, the devil plays the repo man
And he's suckin' up souls as fast as he can

It's no question, it's in our nature
A .45 brings out the criminal behavior
When the clouds in the sky turn black and gloom
As soon as the smoke starts to fill the room

Your heart starts to beat, it's like a ritual
And the feelin' that you get is somewhat spiritual
I'm a have to let you know how reality go
Learn to fly like The Crow as you slide into limbo
