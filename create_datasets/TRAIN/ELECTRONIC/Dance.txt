Love all over the world
Makin' love all over the world
Ooh oh oh oh
Love all over the world
Makin' love all over the world
Oooh oh oh oh

In my dreams you're falling, you're falling, you're falling down
I'm breaking, I'm breaking your rules
I really believe you can try and change your ways
'Cause by the time you'll know I'm gonna take your hand
Won't let you go
We'll lose our mind, we'll lose our mind

Why don't you dance dance dance
And fall in love in France, let's start a new romance
Ooh oh oh
Why don't you dance dance dance
And fall in love in France, let's start a new romance
Ooh oh oh
Why don't you dance dance dance

Love all over the world
Makin' love all over the world
Ooh oh oh oh

This feels lost thinking there's nothing to bring you up
I'll show you, I'll show we're no fools
I'll make you believe you can turn your life around
'Cause by the time you'll know I'm gonna take your hand
Won't let you go,
We'll lose our mind, we'll lose our mind

Why don't you dance dance dance
And fall in love in France, let's start a new romance
Why don't you dance dance dance
And fall in love in France, let's start a new romance
Why don't you dance dance dance
And fall in love in France, let's start a new romance
Ooh oh oh
Why don't you dance dance dance
And fall in love in France, let's start a new romance
Ooh oh oh
Why don't you dance dance dance dance 

Why don't you dance dance dance
And fall in love in France, let's start a new romance
Ooh oh oh
Why don't you dance dance dance
And fall in love in France, let's start a new romance
Ooh oh oh
Why don't you dance dance dance
And fall in love in France, let's start a new romance
Why don't you dance dance dance
And fall in love in France, let's start a new romance
