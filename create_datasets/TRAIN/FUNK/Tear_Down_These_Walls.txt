Tear down these walls
Tear down these walls
Tear down these walls
Its gotta be all
Or nothing
She's the girl
Always dreaming of
She's in my memory
I would love to keep her in a castle
Where I am king
She's the queen
I want to show you
What love can do
I'm no casanova
Just want to get next to you
Tear down these walls
It's gotta be all
Or nothing
Tear it down
Tear it down
I can tell
That you could change your mind
And start to think of us
I could be
Your knight in shining armour
In a tower of love I want to show you
Love that is true
I'm no Casanova
Just want to get next to you
Tear down these walls
It's gotta be all
Or nothing
Tear it down
Tear it down
Forever in love
We would be together
Don't shatter my dreams
I need a little bit of love
Don't close the door
Don't drop this bomb on me
Tear down these walls
Gotta be all
Or nothing
Tear it down
Tear it down
