Let's take our time and concentrate
The mood is right for living, ooh I can't wait
I've waited so long to be with you this special way
Don't be afraid, afraid to stay
And share your love with me this way

I understand baby it's your very first time
I'll be gentle with you baby, it's gonna be alright
And so if we're gonna be together tonight
I'll be good to you baby, sweet to you lady
Guess what we're gonna be tonight

Lovers
Baby, let me be your lover
Lovers
Let me be the only one
Lovers
Baby let me be your lover
Lovers
Let me be the one

Don't let your thoughts get in the way
The time is right for love, it's not too late
The feeling's so strong to be as one this special way
Just take my hand, I'll lead the way
I need you so much, baby won't you stay

I understand baby it's your very first time
I'll be gentle with you baby, it's gonna be alright
And so if we're gonna be together tonight
I'll be good to you baby, sweet to you lady
Guess what we're gonna be tonight

Lovers
Baby, let me be your lover
Lovers
Let me be the only one
Lovers
Baby let me be your lover
Lovers
Let me be the one

Lovers
Baby, let me be your lover
Lovers
Let me be the only one
Lovers
Baby let me be your lover
Lovers
Let me be the one

I want to hold you
I want to touch you
I want to squeeze you
I'll never tease you
Hold you tight all through the night
I'm gonna make you feel alright

Lovers
