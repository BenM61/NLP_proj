I wish that I could take back
All of the things that I've done to hurt you!
I didn't mean to be so cruel!
And yet I know that I've been selfish
And, at times, a just fool!

And every thoughtless thing I've done
Keeps comin' back to haunt me
Because you took each one to heart!
And as I realize it's my fault
We've grown worlds apart . . .

I have regrets, regrets,
For my mistakes an' thinking only of my self
And all that I have left are these regrets, regrets,
For the things I did that somehow you just can't forgive
I guess I'll always have to live with these regrets

If I could right the wrong I've done
Maybe I could stop your leavin'
But there's so much I'm guilty of
And it's too late to say I'm sorry
'cause bein' sorry is not enough!

'cause with each angry word that I've said
Your love for me was dyin',
Each word left a lasting scar
And right now I feel so helpless,
Wishin' I could change the way things are . . .

I have regrets, regrets,
For my mistakes an' thinking only of my self
And all that I have left are these regrets, regrets,
For the things I did that somehow you just can't forgive
I guess I'll always have to live with these regrets . . .
