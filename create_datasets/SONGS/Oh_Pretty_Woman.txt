Pretty woman, walking down the street
Pretty woman, the kind I like to meet
Pretty woman, I don't believe you, you're not the truth
No one can look as good as you

Pretty woman, won't you pardon me?
Pretty woman,  I couldn't help but see
Pretty woman, that you look lovely as can be
Now are you lonely just like me?

Pretty woman, stop while
Pretty woman, talk awhile
Pretty woman, give your smile to me
Pretty woman, hey hey
Pretty woman, look my way
Pretty woman, give your smile to me

Cause I need you, I'll treat you right
Come to me baby, be mine tonight

Pretty woman, stop while
Pretty woman, talk awhile
Pretty woman, give your smile to me
Pretty woman, hey hey
Pretty woman, look my way
Pretty woman, give your smile to me
