Another time, another place
A chance to start all over
I've had my share, I've paid my dues
I'm slowly moving forward
I've had to learn how to forget
But I'm still living with my regrets

[chorus:]
If I could break through time
I'd wipe it out, I'd come out clean
Re-do it all like it should have been
I'd live it loud and chase my dreams
You'd follow me if I could break through time

I've failed to see, there's good in me
If only I'd know better
But in my mind I've learned to fly
High above these walls

[chorus:]
If I could break through time
I'd wipe it out, I'd come out clean
Re-do it all like it should have been
I'd live it loud and chase my dreams
You'd follow me if I could break through time

[bridge:]
No there's no making up for wasted time
Here's for all the loved ones I let down
All I want is to leave the past behind
Make the future mine

[chorus:]
If I could break through time
I'd wipe it out, I'd come out clean
Re-do it all like it should have been
I'd live it loud and chase my dreams
You'd follow me if I could break through time

If I could break through time
Make the future mine
