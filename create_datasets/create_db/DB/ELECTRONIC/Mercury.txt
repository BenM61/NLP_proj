My mercury's in retrograde
My mercury's in retrograde
My mercury's in retrograde
My mercury's in retrograde

Mercury's in, Mercury's in, Mercury's
In retrograde

This is not the time, the time to start a new love
This is not the time, the time to sign a lease
Try not to worry about what's forgotten
Try not to worry about what's been missed
Scars on shins and scars on my knuckles
Today I woke up in a basketball court
Jonjo's in Sydney and he ain't returning
I'm sitting in Soho trying to stay drunk

In any bar in the world
From Silverlake to Williamsburg
You could pick another stranger
And fall in love

My mercury's in retrograde
Mercury's in, mercury's in retrograde

This is not the time, the tie to start a new love
This is not the time, the time to sign a lease
Try not to worry about what's forgotten
Try not to worry about what's been missed
Bleeding gums and veins protruding
You're starting to hate all of your clothes
Neumayr's in LA and she ain't returning
I'm sleeping with people I don't even like

In any bar in the world
From Silverlake to Williamsburg
You could pick another stranger
And fall in love

My mercury's in retrograde
Mercury's in, mercury's in retrograde
Mercyry's in, mercury's in retrograde

When I saw you last night
I wanted to say, run away with me
Away from these cynics
That this could be the start of
Something truly real
But all that I could say was "hey"
Was hey
Was hey
Was hey

My mercury's in retrograde
Mercury's in, mercury's in retrograde
Mercyry's in, mercury's in retrograde
My mercury's in retrograde
Mercury's in, mercury's in retrograde
Mercyry's in, mercury's in retrograde.
