I don't know about your brain-
But mine is really bossy
I come home from a day on the golf course
And I find all these messages

Scribbled on wrinkled up scraps of paper
And they say thing like:
Why don't you get a real job?
Or: You and what army?

Or: Get a horse.
And then I hear this voice
Comin from the back of my head Uh huh
(Whoa-ho) Yep! It's my brain again

And when my brain talks to me, he says:
Take me out to the ballgame
Take me out to the park
Take me to the movies

'Cause I love to sit in the dark
Take me to Tahiti
'Cause I love to be hot
And take me out on the town tonight

'Cause I know the new hot spot. He says:
Babydoll! Ooo oo oo Babydoll Ooo He says:
Babydoll! I love it when you come when I call
Babydoll! You don't have to talk I know it all

Babydoll! Ooo oo oo Babydoll Ooo
Well I'm sitting around trying to write a letter
I'm wracking my brains trying to think
Of another word for horse

I ask my brain for some assistance.
And he says: Huh...Let's see...How about cow?
That's close. He says:
Take me out to the ballgame

Take me out to the park
Take me to the movies
'Cause I love to sit in the dark
Take me to your leader

And I say: Do you mean George?
And he says: I just want to meet him
And I say:
Come on I mean I don't even know George!

And he says:
Babydoll! Ooo oo oo Babydoll Ooo He says:
Babydoll! I love it when you come when I call
Babydoll! You don't have to talk I know it all

Babydoll! Ooo oo oo Babydoll Ooo
Babydoll! Babydoll! Ooo oo oo
Babydoll! Babydoll! Ooo oo oo
Babydoll! Babydoll! Ooo oo oo
