I have heard of a land on the far away strand,
'Tis a beautiful home of the soul
Built by Jesus on high, where we never shall die,
'Tis a land where we never grow old.

Never grow old, never grow old,
In a land where well never grow old
Never grow old, never grow old,
In a land where well never grow old.

In that beautiful home where well never more roam,
We shall be in the sweet by and by
Happy praise to the King through eternity sing,
'Tis a land where we never shall die.

Never grow old, never grow old,
In a land where well never grow old
Never grow old, never grow old,
In a land where well never grow old.

When our work here is done and the life crown is won,
And our troubles and trials are o'er
All our sorrow will end, and our voices will blend,
With the loved ones who've gone on before.
