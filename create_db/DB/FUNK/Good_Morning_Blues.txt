Good morning blues
Walk right on in
I knew you would be around today
My babe said goodbye last night
Because we had a silly fight 
She packed her thing and went her way

Good morning blues
How have you been?
Who ever though we would meet again
But faith can play such funny tricks
Like break a heart in two for kicks
So settle down and stay a while my friend
Help yourself to some heartache
Pour out a glass of misery 
Then let's sit in the gloom
And let her perfume stir up a haunting memory

Good morning blues
Ain't a sin?
She's gone and left me all alone
Until the day she's back with me
You'll be my only company
Take off your shoes and make yourself at home

Good morning blues
Just make yourself at home
Good morning blues
Ain't it a sin?
She's gone and left me all alone
Until the day she's back with me
You'll be my only company
Take off your shoes and make yourself at home

Good morning blues
Just make yourself at home, oh yeah
