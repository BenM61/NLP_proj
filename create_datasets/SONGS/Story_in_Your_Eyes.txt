I've been thinking about our fortune
And I've decided that we're really not to blame
For the love that's deep inside us now, is still the same
And the sound we make together
Is the music to the story in your eyes
It's been shining down upon you now, I realize

Listen to the tide slowly turning
Wash all our heartaches away
We are part of the fire that is burning
And from the ashes we can build another day
But I'm frightened for your children
And the life that we are living is in vain
And the sunshine we've been waiting for
Will turn to rain

When the final line is over
And it's certain that the curtain's gonna fall
I can hide inside your sweet sweet love
Forever more

Listen to the tide slowly turning
Wash all our heartaches away
We are part of the fire that is burning
And from the ashes we can build another day
But I'm frightened for your children
And the life that we are living is in vain
And the sunshine we've been waiting for
Will turn to rain
