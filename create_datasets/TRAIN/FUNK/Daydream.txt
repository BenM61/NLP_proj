I can do nothing but daydream, baby
All I do is daydream

I can do nothing but daydream
I daydream about you, baby
I can do nothing but daydream
I daydream about you, baby

I'm sitting on my job
And I'm staring into space, yeah
My supervisor's watching
I know I'll soon be replaced, yeah

I can't keep my concentration
No matter how hard I try

I can do nothing but daydream
I daydream about you, baby
I can do nothing but daydream
I daydream about you, baby

The day is long and it's so boring
'Cause I'd rather be with you
But I've got to put this time in
Because I've got some bills that's due

I can't help reminiscing
About the warmth of your kisses

I can do nothing but daydream
I daydream about you, baby
I can do nothing but daydream
I daydream about you, baby, ooh babe

On the crowded bus with stand room only
Trying to make it home to you
My feet are sore, my back is aching
I'm so glad the day is through

I'm in deep medication
Some folks say I'm in a trance

I can do nothing but daydream
I daydream about you, baby
I can do nothing but daydream
I daydream about you, baby

I can do nothing but daydream
I daydream about you, baby
I can do nothing but daydream
I daydream about you, baby

I can do nothing but daydream
I daydream about you, baby
I can do nothing but daydream
I daydream about you, baby

I can do nothing but daydream
I daydream about you, baby
I can do nothing but daydream
I daydream about you, baby

I can do nothing but daydream
I daydream about you, baby
I can do nothing but daydream
I daydream
