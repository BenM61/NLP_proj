The weight falls upon my back
Dig deep to balance attack
Anger appear
Bury big fear
Soon old fire consumes
Battle with will
But something will spill
So I take the time slowly
Learn to loose my mind
Finding another unreason
And I leave the goal lightly
Learn to valentine
Kissing another true fiction
Kissing another true fiction
We say
Welcome home
The weight waits to call my bluff
Dares me to shed this tough
Shell of resolve
And self-absolve
With plenty to go around
Why me martyr, with sound
Watch it unfold
Grow young and old
So I take the time slowly
Learn to lose my mind
Finding another unreason
And I leave the goal lightly
Learn to valentine
Kissing another true fiction
Kissing another true fiction
We say
Welcome home
The weight has a way to evolve
Attach it to ego dissolve
Guru within
Air fusion
We all sin
We all win
So I take the time slowly
