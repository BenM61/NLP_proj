Give me your best Copper Kiss
Let's bite until our lips are split
You kinda look like him
I'll dress and act like her
Dreamt of fabricated love

You're so gross you make me sick
I'll lose your taste with my spit
When you crack your bones
I hope they snap in half
I would never call for help

Pour your metal in my mouth
Lick my lips and taste yourself
Let me roll your blood on my tongue, oh no

Pour your metal in my mouth
Lick my lips and taste yourself
Let me roll your blood on my tongue, oh no
Oh no, it's stained my clothes

No one ever has to know
Where we go or who we are
I can't be seen with you
Don't ever go that far
Meet me at your lovers place

Pour your metal in my mouth
Lick my lips and taste yourself
Let me roll your blood on my tongue, oh no

Pour metal in my mouth
Lick my lips and taste yourself
Let me roll your blood on my tongue, oh no
Oh no, it's stained my clothes

Don't leave without my copper kiss
Say the lisp before you slip
When you're crawling back
I won't step on you
No one would remember it

Pour your metal in my mouth
Lick my lips and taste yourself
Let me roll your blood on my tongue, oh no

Pour your metal in my mouth
Lick my lips and taste yourself
Let me roll your blood on my tongue, oh no

Pour your metal in my mouth
Lick my lips and taste yourself
Let me roll your blood on my tongue, oh no

Pour your metal in my mouth
Lick my lips and taste yourself
Let me roll your blood on my tongue, oh no
Oh no, it's stained my clothes
