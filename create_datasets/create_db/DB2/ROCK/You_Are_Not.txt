Lonely, lonely, undefined
You say you take your time, I say you hide away
Lonely, lonely, hard to shine when they don't notice you at all
Sink further every day

You're only so lonely, and I never had a doubt, 
You don't even know me, still you pass your judgement out
When you belong, you're just a face in the crowd, 
You're only lonely, so lonely, like everybody else

Lonely, lonely, little fly, you say they pay no mind
I say there's no better way
You hang yourself in your own web, drawn and quartered out
The more you hurt, the more you heal, the more you'll figure out

You're only so lonely and I never had a doubt, 
You don't even know me, still you pass your judgement out
When you belong, you're just a face in the crowd, 
You're only lonely, so lonely, like everybody else

You are not a diamond, you are not a shining star
It doesn't mean that you're not perfect exactly as you are

You're only so lonely, and I never had a doubt, 
You don't even know me, still you pass your judgement out
When you belong, you're just a face in the crowd, 
You're only lonely so lonely, like everybody else

You are not a diamond, 
You are not a shining star, 
It doesn't mean that you're not perfect exactly as you are
