Everybody get up

Flash back, who's that dancin' to the latest
Suave de bone, the greatest, ooh, he sure is moving me
That's what I said though you didn't know yet
Our love is was kismet, soon to be made history

So don't you have no doubt, I'm gonna spell it out

Baby, what's happening
Entre vous Lady Tee
I've heard a boatload of others ladies' raps
But they ain't got nothin' on me
I'm less than five foot one, a hundred pounds of fun
I like sophisticated funk
I live on Dom Perignon, caviar, filet mignon
And you can best believe that's bunk
Here's what I'm talking, baby
Square Biz, Square Biz

I've been called Casper, Shorty, Lil' Bit
And some they call me Vanilla Child
But you know that don't mean my world to me
?Cause baby, names can't cramp my style
I love chick-icken
And Buff's collard greens
A little hot water corn bread
I love you too Cat daddy
But don't you let that go to your head
That's what I'm talking, baby
Square Biz, Square Biz

You know I love spirituals and rock
Sarah Vaughn, Johann Sebastian Bach
Shakespeare, Maya Angelou
And Nikki Giovanni just to name a few
Well, I'm wild and peaceful Lady Tee
I got to keep my irons in the fire, you see
I got the point, the scam, the low, the deal
What you feel, say what

Flash back, who's that
Flash back
Flash back, who's that
Flash back

So don't you have no doubt, I'm gonna spell it out
I'll hip you to the Tee that is
I got the best, the most, baby, from coast to coast
And I don't wanna boast, but I love you Square Biz

I'm talkin' Square Biz to you, baby
Square, Square Biz
I'm talkin' love that it
Square, Square Biz

I'm talkin' Square Biz to you, baby
Square, Square Biz
I'm talkin' love that is
Woo

I'm gonna talk about it
I'm gonna talk my love
I'm gonna talk about it
I'm gonna talk my love

I'm gonna hip you to the Tee
The Tee, The Tee
What's the Tee
Now you know that's me

Flash back, who's that
Flash back
Flash back, who's that
Flash back
Flash back, who's that
Flash back
Flash back, who's that
Flash back

I'm gonna talk about it
I'm gonna talk my love
I'm gonna talk about it
I'm gonna talk my love

I'm gonna hip you to the Tee
Everybody's dancing on the Tee
Quit talking Square Biz
Everybody's dancing on the Tee
Quit talking Square Biz
