All the boys and all the pretty girls
Summertime, I'm gonna make you mine
And all the fun to shine on everyone
Summertime, I'm gonna make you mine
Summertime, I'm gonna make you mine

It gets dark, you watch them fall
Then it gets light, then it gets louder
Watch them bloom, watch them blossom, they grow higher
Not here forever, but for now, let's do whatever
And then never even find something that's close to being better
Then you fall into its arms, you got bare feet out in the barn
And you know that whatever, there will never be no harm

All the boys and all the pretty girls
Summertime, I'm gonna make you mine
And all the fun to shine on everyone
Summertime, I'm gonna make you mine
Summertime, I'm gonna make you mine

So much sand stuck inside my shoe
We watch a thunderstorm, kill an afternoon
We feel no pain, go swimming in the rain
Two hearts that were apart are now the same

So won't you tell me if you wanna be my baby?
Yes, for sure, and not a maybe
We won't try, come along, no need to cry
Then the sun comes back around, I'm back in time, you just got found just now
It's just that good, cause we could and we were always down

All the boys and all the pretty girls
Summertime, I'm gonna make you mine
And all the fun to shine on everyone
Summertime, I'm gonna make you mine
Summertime, I'm gonna make you mine

If I can't have you, you don't wanna know what I'm gonna do
If I can't have you, you don't wanna know what I'm gonna do
I'll never find another one
So if I can't have you, think of what you'll be putting me through

All the boys and all the pretty girls
Summertime, I'm gonna make you mine
And all the fun to shine on everyone
Summertime, I'm gonna make you mine
Summertime, I'm gonna make you mine

So won't you tell me if you wanna be my baby?
Yes, for sure, and not a maybe
We won't try, come along, no need to cry
Then the sun comes back around, I'm back in time, you just got found just now
It's just that good, cause we could and we were always down

Summertime, I'm gonna make you mine
