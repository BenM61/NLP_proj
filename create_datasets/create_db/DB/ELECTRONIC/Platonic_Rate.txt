Military bliss 
Shamens in your shoes 
Dollar tambourines
Fall in the stream blue and green

Turn the summer over 
Let me feel too much
Then all that energy could not guarantee
Hawking talking rust 

Kicking up the dust
Goldrush is the air
Spilling everywhere hidden virtue
Turn the summer over 

Let me feel too much
Then all that energy could not guarantee
Take a seat and fall asleep and sing my little song 
Carry on

Military bliss: never knew someone 
Shavings in the food who won't know who you are
Dollar tambourines driving in my car
You fall in the stream in too deep fantasies finding their fusions

Turn the summer over turn the summer over
Let me feel too much let me feel too much
Then all that energy could not guarantee then all that energy could not shake the freeze
Take a seat and fall asleep and sing my little song 

Carry on
