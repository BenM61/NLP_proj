Baby Love, I think its time now 
To share with you these feelings that I'm feeling now 
It's been three years since I've known you 
Nothing but happiness since I've found you 

Its been a long time coming still going strong 
Through good and bad we've been holding on 
Within my soul its been overdue 
'Cause my hearts been longing to ask you 

Will you be mine on this day 
Will you be the sun shining may 
Will you be the stars and my nights 
Will you be the joy, the joy in my life 
Will you be my everything 
Will you be the happy every song I sing 
Will you be the love I can't deny 
Will you be the love, the love of all time 
Will you be mine 

When I think about how it all began 
I was looking for fun but somehow we became 
Good friends 
We couldn't see this fate that lied ahead 
Or that we would ever bond like we did 

I praise the day my fate was revealed 
Now I know that destiny is real 
Is it a sin for love to feel this good 
I don't think but I'm asking you 

Will you be mine on this day 
Will you be the sun shining may 
Will you be the stars and my nights 
Will you be the joy, the joy in my life 
Will you be my everything 
Will you be the happy every song I sing 
Will you be the love I can't deny 
Will you be the love, the love of all time 
Will you be mine 

I'm down on my knees to vow to you 
My everlasting love because its overdue 
For all the times we shared and those to come 
Is ever still coming 
This ring is a token of my love with you 

Will you be mine on this day 
Will you be the sun shining may 
Will you be the stars and my nights 
Will you be the joy, the joy in my life 
Will you be my everything 
Will you be the happy every song I sing 
Will you be the love I can't deny 
Will you be the love, the love of all time 
Will you be mine
