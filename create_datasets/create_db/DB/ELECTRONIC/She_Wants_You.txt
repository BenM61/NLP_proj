I Know she wants, I know she wants 
I Know she wants, I know she wants 
I Know she wants, I know she wants 
I Know she wants, I know she wants 

Boy I know you better 
That you think you know yourself 
I know where your coming from 
Seeing you together 
And I swear I can tell 
There's somthing going on 

I've seen her expression 
as she looks in your direction 
Its there in your eyes 
You say there's no conection 
You don' think that's her intention 
Baby you must be blind 

I know that she want you 
She wants you, She wants you 
I know it instinctivly 
(I Know she wants, I know she wants you) 
I know that she wants you 
She wants you, She wants you 
You say your in love with me 
(I Know she wants, I know she wants you) 

Boy you think I'm crazy 
You say she don't mean a thing 
That I'm the one for you 
She just wants your body baby 
She don't give a damm 
What I've been going through 

She wants satisfaction 
To be centre of attraction 
I'ts clear to me 
She needs no imitations 
she's got such dertermination 
Baby you still don't see 

I know that she want you 
She wants you, She wants you 
I know it instinctivly 
(I Know she wants, I know she wants you) 
I know that she wants you 
She wants you, She wants you 
You say your in love with me 
(I Know she wants, I know she wants you) 

You understand 
You take my hand 
You're proud to be my man 
And I won't let you go 
I've seen her expression 
As she looks in your direction 
Its there in your eyes 
You say there's no conection 
You don't think that's her intention 
Baby you must be blind 

I know that she want you 
She wants you, She wants you 
I know it instinctivly 
(I Know she wants, I know she wants you) 
I know that she wants you 
She wants you, She wants you 
You say your in love with me 
(I Know she wants, I know she wants you)
