Come to
Come to
Come to
I'm kneeling down 
To get closer to the sign 
And you're breaking my back every time
It's hard to see it 
For all the rust 
But I saw it fading and I have some faith in us
Don't need to tell me 
You know this ain't nothing new 
Of course I love you 
Of course I do
To outplay is not to love 
And yet I keep on coming back to call your bluff
It's hard to see it 
For all the rust 
But I saw it fading and I have some faith in us
Your evening eyes the rain outside the way I know 
No fear that I'll be fading out alone
Your evening eyes the rain outside the way I know 
No fear that I'll be fading out alone
Your evening eyes the rain outside the way I know 
No fear that I'll be fading out alone
It's hard to see it, for all the rust, 
But I saw it fading and I have some faith in us
