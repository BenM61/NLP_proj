I got someone on the left of my left side
I got cigarette on cigarette mindful
I got foolish so I took him on home I said ooo oo

you don't need me don't tell me you want me
I I'm over it
You can't have it and that's why you want it
I I'm over it

baby if you and me aren't trying
I can't see the point
Come on come on
Baby if you and me aren't trying
I can't see the point
Come on come on

I got exorcist on my morning station
A foolish mind giving me my own halo
I am tempted into your living room
I said ooo ooo oo

you don't need me don't tell me you want me
I I'm over it
You can't have it and that's why you want it
I I'm over it

baby if you and me aren't trying
I can't see the point
Come on come on
Baby if you and me aren't trying
I can't see the point
Come on come on

Coz you and me are holdin'
You and me are holding on
But if time alone, aches and bruises this heart of mine
I will place my weary head and sleep alone

baby if you and me aren't trying
I can't see the point
Come on come on
Baby if you and me aren't trying
I can't see the point
Come on come on
