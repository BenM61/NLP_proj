[B-Real]
Come inside, hello everybody, welcome
Think you better be ready for the battle when the shit goes down
Cause we warring
All you fucking yellow comets running from the front line
If anybody wanna get away hey
I'll find your fucking ass in due time
Run and seek shelter but you never will escape
Flipping over the gate, cause you can't wait
To get your fucking ass away
But you're trapped, and there's no way out of this mushroom cloud
But you never wanna realize that I'm planted
In your mind now
Cypress Hill compound, you could hear the sound
Let another motherfucker run up
And I'll put your ass down (down)
Then I'll peal from your cap the Cypress Hill star
Quick look around, you can't hide
You just might die right where you are

[Chorus: B-Real]
AUDIO X, We gonna your blow your head up (up)
Synthetic flows, they gonna make you get up
Give me any record and I'll flip it any style
Niggas can't help it, cause they bumping the shit loud

[Barron Ricks]
Hey yo whats up kid, feel the rush, glad you kept in touch
With these niggas who be puffin on the Dutch
Busting guns, lay back in the cut
Can it be, it's just a dream when you're on your scene smoking the green
Cause ain't shit never what you think it seem
From the streets where life ain't cheap
Cypress Hill, Soul Assassins, while you asking, "Who that rapping?"
We get all up inside your grill, with the skill
Shoot to kill when it's time for action
See you can't hide, from this homicide, that ain't no lie
Better kiss that black ass goodbye
When you try to play these wiseguys
So who's complaining when we intensify the levels on the rhyme
You better get ready for the battle when the shit goes down
Because we are the wild

[Chorus]

[Barron Ricks]
"Audio terrorists
Mic specialists
About to blow this
Blast off"

[B-Real]
Lookin in your eyes, I see your body bag figure
Better be ready for the battle when the shit goes down
Cause it's on nigga
What you wanna do, you better pay close attention
Let it be known, I control the zone
Beyond your comprehension
Blunt session, you feel the tension begin to rise
F*ck and feed him, if they can't take a joke
And get high
I'm feeling lye, in my lungs, what the deal bro?
So many people wanna hit my joint
But they never got none
Imagine that bullshit, happens all the time
Niggas better start growing they own
They cannot f*ck with mine
Give me any record and I'll flip it any style
Beginners better run back to the lab
And practice for a while

[Chorus]

Blast off!"
