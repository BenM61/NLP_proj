There's my dreams
Bloody dyin', face down on the floor
I can't believe the emptiness
Struggle all alone by my own

Day by day I feel it slippin' away
(Away from me)
The more I stumble
The more I fade away, yeah

All the things you tried to hide
And every time you had to lie, I'm broken
Every smile I had to fake
And every time I want to break, I'm broken again

Nothin' seems to be just what I've become
With every ounce of faith I give
Still feel it all comin' undone

Day by day I feel you slippin' away
(Away from me)
The more I crumble
The more I need to breathe, yeah

All the things you tried to hide
And every time you had to lie, I'm broken
Every smile I had to fake
And every time I want to break, I'm broken

(You can't break me)
You can't break me
(You can't break me)
You can't break me

You can't break me
You can't break me
You can't break me, yeah

All the things you tried to hide
And every time you had to lie, I'm broken
Every smile I had to fake
And every time I want to break, I'm broken

All the things you tried to hide
And every time you had to lie, I'm broken
Every smile I had to fake
And every time I want to break, I'm broken

(You can't break me)
You can't break me
(You can't break me)
You can't break me

You can't break me
You can't break me
You can't break me, yeah
