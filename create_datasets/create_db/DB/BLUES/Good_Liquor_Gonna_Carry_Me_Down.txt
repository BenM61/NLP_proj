Lord, I know a little girl
'Bout sixteen years old
She says, "Bill, stop drinkin'
I will satisfy your soul

But I just keep on-a drinkin'
Yeah, I keep on drinkin'
Yeah, I just keep on drinkin'
Till good liquor carry me down

Now, my woman told me
About fifteen years ago
"Bill, you gonna drink one of these mornings
And you'll never drink no more

But I just keep on-a drinkin'
Yeah, I keep on drinkin'
Yeah, I just keep on drinkin'
Till good liquor carry me down

Yes, I went to the doctor
With my head in my hands
The doctor said, "Big Bill, I think
I'll have to give you monkey glands"

But I just keep on-a drinkin'
Yeah, I keep on drinkin'
Yeah, I just keep on drinkin'
Till good liquor carry me down

Lord, my woman told me to stop drinkin'
And come on home
Say, "If you don't big bill, some other man
Gonna carry your business home"

But I just keep on-a drinkin'
Yeah, I keep on drinkin'
Yeah, I just keep on drinkin'
Till good liquor carry me down
