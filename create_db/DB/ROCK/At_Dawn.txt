At dawn they ride again, 
They'll haul you out to the streets. 

They'll burn your papers and your empty trash cans, 
Beat this thought into your head.
Singin over and over again: 

"All your life is obscene!" 
"Forget the papers, forget your musical dreams!" 
But that's when my knife rises, 
Their life ends and my life starts again.
Again (4x)
