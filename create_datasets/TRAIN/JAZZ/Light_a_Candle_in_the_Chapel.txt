Light a candle in the chapel
At the closing of each day
Keep it burning while you're yearning
For the one who went away
Say a pray'r and ask the angel
To guide and to watch from above
Light a candle in the chapel
For the one you love
Say a pray'are and ask the angel
To guide and to watch from above
Light a candle in the chapel
For the one you love
