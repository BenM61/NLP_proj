I opened the curtains wide
The sun caught your face, made you light up the bedroom
Feeling all soft inside
When you smile with that beautiful smile

And I turned on the radio
It was something I vaguely remembered from way back
When life was a bit more slow
I think I can say things are...

Like a cloud of blossoms falling
Ain''t it such a gorgeous morning?
Hold your breath and reach for the blue
Just me and you

Like a cloud of blossoms falling
I thought I''d reached the end this morning
Like a cloud of blossoms falling
Falling for you!

And I sat by the side of you
Tracing a line from your lips to your shoulders
Seemed to me like you knew
When you smiled with that beautiful smile...

Like a cloud of blossoms falling
Ain''t it such a gorgeous morning?
Hold your breath and reach for the blue
Just me and you

Like a cloud of blossoms falling
I thought I''d reached the end this morning
Like a cloud of blossoms falling
Falling for you!

I should say I love you, I want to, I want to
I should say I love you, I want to, I want to

I should say I love you, I want to, I want to
I should say I love you, I want to, I want to!

Closing my eyes and I fell asleep...
