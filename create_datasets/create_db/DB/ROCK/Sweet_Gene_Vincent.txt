Blue gene baby
Skinny white sailor, the chances were slender
The beauties were breif
Shall I mourn you decline with some thunderbird wine
And a black hankercheif? 
I miss your sad Virginia whisper
I miss the voice that called my heart

Sweet gene vincent
Young and old and gone
Sweet gene vincent

Who, who, who slapped john?
White face, black shirt
White socks, black shoes
Black hair, white strat
Bled white, died black

Sweet gene vincent
Let the blue roll tonight
At the sock hop ball in the union hall
Where the bop is there delight

Here come duck-tailed Danny dragging Uncanny Annie
She's tehone with the flying feet
You can break the peace daddy sickle grease
The beat is reet complete
And you jump back honey in the dungerees
Tight sweater and a ponny tail
Will you guess her age when she comes back stage?
The hoodlems bite their nails

Black gloves, white frost 
Black crepe, white lead 
White sheet, black knight 
Jet black, dead white 

Sweet gene vincent
There's one in every town
And the devil drives 'till the hurse arrives
And you lay that pistol down

Sweet gene vincent
There's nowhere left to hide
With lazy skin and ash-tray eyes
A perforated pride

So farewell mademoiselle, knicker-bocker hotel
Farewell to money owed
But when your leg still hurts and you need more shirts
You got to get back on the road
