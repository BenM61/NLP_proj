Don't speak of your beliefs
They are yours to keep
Memories will fade as time goes by

Remember just yourself
Me, I'm someone else
You will be the only one to try

Freedom to believe don't cost a thing
Innocence should not be bought and sold

Kissing bolts of lightning
It'll make you sing
Electricity deep in your soul

Don't tell me who I am
I don't give a damn
Your dreams are nothing, you're a nowhere man

Think you're really smart
Think you're pure in heart
Go ahead and tell yourself you're not

Disbelief don't ever cost a dime
Innocence should not be bought and sold

You need an open mind
Shiver up your spine
Electricity deep in your soul, hey, hey

Don't speak of time gone by
Don't even try
My memories are skulls and vultures in the sky

I remember everyone
Tall or deaf and dumb
Now I am the only one passed by

Freedom to believe don't have a price
Innocence never gets too old
You need a bolt of rock
Severe toxic shock

Electricity deep in your soul
