I reach for the stars
When I reach for your love
For so far above me you always will be
Like a clown longs to be a king in a play
I long for the things that are so far away

I reach for the stars
When I reach for your hand
But stars tumble down
From the clouds to the land

When you come to my arms
In that moment devine
All the stars in the sky
Are mine, all mine

I reach for the stars
When I reach for your hand
But stars tumble down
From the clouds to the land

When you come to my arms
In that moment devine
All the stars in the sky
Are mine, all mine
