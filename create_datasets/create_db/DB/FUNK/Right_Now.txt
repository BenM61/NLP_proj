Right now, let me take you by the hand
Right now, put your lips at my command
Right now, fly me onto lovers' land
Baby, don't you leave me at the post
Kiss me, let me feel it coast to coast
Right now, baby, need your love the most

You have set my soul on fire
Only you can satisfy this great desire

Right now, let the whole world break in two
Right now, stars will tumble from the blue
Right now, just as long as I'm with you

Right now, it's the time and it's the place
Right now, for a ride through outer space
Right now, let me have that wild embrace

You have set my soul on fire
Only you can satisfy this great desire

One time, let the wine of love flow free
One time, be the lover you can be
Right now, come and give yourself to me
