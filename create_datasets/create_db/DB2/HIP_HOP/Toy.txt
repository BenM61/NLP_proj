I'm chasing

I'm chasing shadows in the gallows
Collecting what was stolen from me

I got ss-stammers and no manners I'm the man that's gonna play it for keeps
Oceanic cinematic appetite for something bigger than free

You lick it and you stick it
And it's kinda like the taste
Of everyting

Emaciated kinda wasted
Can't remember what the time in which we met

Somewhere in Tucson
I watched for one or two songs
Then I left

I give two cents and a dollar
For all the paranoia I forget
Well boredom is a killer
For me the sealer dealer
Now you're dead
(Come on)

You paid your debt
You're playing dead
There's no respect

You're just a broken little toy
Silly little boy
Broken little toy
You're just a silly little boy

Lover, lover
We had a flutter
Now I make you shudder
I wonder if you ever think of me
Watching from the cupboard
You think I'm narcissistic
But if he's in the picture
Then I'll just be in the kitchen making tea
Do we agree on everything we discussed
Remember when we begun
I never meant to disrupt
You promised we'd stay in touch
I know I'm on the sidelines
But if you don't mind I'll stay
You can let me be your puppy dog
Leading you astray
F*ck

You just a broken little toy
Silly little boy
Broken little toy
You silly little boy
Juh-juh-juh-juh-juh-juh-juh-juh
You just a broken little toy
Silly little boy
Broken little toy
You silly little boy

Sold for what I get
I'm burning dirty money to light a cigarette
I'm not for sale
I'm not for rent
I never repent
Yes yes yes
I teach a class in sinning
I'm always winning
Just for you
Fictitious revenue
