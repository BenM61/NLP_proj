When I was young
Coach called me the tiger
I always had
A knack with the danger

Living in fear in the year of the tiger 
Living in fear in the year of the tiger 

Italian shoes
Like these rubes know the difference
Suitcase of cash
In the back of my stick shift
I had to be the best of the bourgeoisie
Now my kingdom for a cup of coffee

Living in fear in the year of the tiger
Living in fear in the year of the tiger

Oh America,
Can I owe you one
Oh America,
Can I owe you one
Oh America
Can I owe you one
Oh America
Can I owe you one

Living in fear in the year of the tiger 
Living in fear in the year of the tiger 
Living in fear in the year of the tiger 
Living in fear in the year of the tiger
