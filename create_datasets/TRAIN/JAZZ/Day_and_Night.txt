All of the day, all of the night 
You do the things that make me feel so right 
My shining star, my guiding light (my shining light) 
And that's the day and night, babe 

I just ain't the same when you're away 
You are my inspiration 
I'm hanging on to every word you say 
'Cause you are my motivation 
You make me feel so right 
Every day and night 

'Cause the only time I think of you 
Is every day and all night through 
Whenever I breathe you're on my mind 
Every day and night, babe 
All of the day, all of the night 
You do the things that make me feel so right 
My shining star, my guiding light(my shining light) 
And that's the day and night, babe 

I need you tonight, but you're not around 
I need to hear your voice, baby 
Something feels strange, there's not a single sound 
I wish you were at my door, babe 
You make me feel so right 
Every day and night 

'Cause the only time I think of you 
Is every day and all night through 
Whenever I breathe you're on my mind 
Every day and every night, babe 
All of the day, all of the night 
You do the things that make me feel so right 
My shining star, my guiding light(my shining light) 
And that's the day and night, babe 

Gotta let me know, oh, yeah 
When you're comin' home (when you're coming home) 
You know you make me feel so right 
Every day and night 

All of the day, all of the night 
You do the things that make me feel so right 
My shining star, my guilding light(my shining light) 
Day and night, babe 

'Cause the only time I think of you 
Is every day and all night through 
Whenever I breathe you're on my mind 
Every day and night, babe 
All of the day, all of the night 
You do the things that make me feel so right 
My shining star, my guiding light(my shining light) 
And that's th day and night, babe
