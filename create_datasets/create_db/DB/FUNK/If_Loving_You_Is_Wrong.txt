If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
If being right means being without
Id rather be wrong
My old man says it's a shame
It's a downright disgrace
As long as I got you by my side
I don't care what our people say
My friend tell me there's no future in loving a married man
If I can't have you when I want you
I'm a see you when I can

Am I wrong to fall so deeply in love with you
Knowing you have a wife and two little children depending on you too
Am I wrong to hunger for the gentleness of your touch
Oh when I got someone else at home who needs me just as much

Am I wrong for giving my love to a married man
Tell me am I wrong for trying to hold on to the best thing I ever had?
