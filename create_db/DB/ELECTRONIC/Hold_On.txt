Chorus:
Give us, give us a chance
I just wanna hold on, 
I just wanna hold on
Hold on
I just wanna hold on

Waiting for your love
Cause I can?t break away
No I can?t break this start
Fading from your touch
Why do I keeW us safe
To your distant heart

Chorus:
Give us, give us a chance
I just wanna hold on, 
I just wanna hold on
I just wanna hold on
I just wanna hold on
Hold on
Hold on
I just wanna hold on
I just wanna hold on
Just wanna, just wanna, just wanna
Hold on
Just wanna, just wanna, just wanna
Hold on
I just wanna hold on
