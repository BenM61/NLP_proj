Damn, I just don't know how to say this
How am I gonna tell her this?
I know there's something wrong
What am I gonna do?
I have so much on my mind that I want to say to her
I love her
That's the only way she's gonna trust me
That's the only way she's gonna have faith in me
And I can be the only one in her life, forever

I heard the news through the grapevine
That things are not right in your life
And you feel so lonely cause there's no one holding you at night
And you said that you're tired
You're tired of living two lives
So I'm telling you with a straight face
That I'll show you a better life

It's all plain to see
You don't deserve the things you're going through
All you gotta do is call me
And I'll come running to your rescue
Baby just

Come to me, I've got what you need
All I want to do is to rescue you
Come to me, I've got what you need
All I want to do is to rescue you

You sit at home relaxing
And you work so hard to earn a dollar
And when you're home relieving
There's so much stress and hardships on your shoulders
What does it take to realize?
That you're the only woman I need in my life
You have your doubts baby
You won't have to worry, worry, worry
Worry another night

Come to me, I've got what you need
All I want to do is to rescue you
Come to me, I've got what you need
All I want to do is to rescue you

I will run page me 911
And I'll set you free
From your misery
Come to me
I've got what you need
All I want to do is to rescue you

Hey (Hi)
What's wrong? (Nothing)
Come on you can talk to me
Are you crying? (Nothing)
Come on just talk to me
(I can't talk about it right now)
Yeah I'm on my way over

Come to me, I've got what you need
All I want to do is to rescue you
Come to me, I've got what you need
All I want to do is to rescue you

I will run page me 911
And I'll set you free
From your misery
Come to me
I've got what you need
All I want to do is to rescue you
