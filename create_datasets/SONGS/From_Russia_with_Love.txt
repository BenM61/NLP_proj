From Russia with love, I fly to you
Much wiser since my goodbye to you
I've travelled the world to learn
I must return
From Russia with love

I've seen places, faces
And smile for a moment
But, oh, you haunted me so
Still, my tongue tied young bride
Would not let my love for you show
In case you'd say "No"

To Russia I flew but there and then
I suddenly knew you'd care again
My running around is through
I'd fly to you
From Russia with love
