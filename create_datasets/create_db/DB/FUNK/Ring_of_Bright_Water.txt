Where sun and wind play on a ring of bright water
Thats where my heartland will be
The deer on the hill in the first snows of winter
the gull in the sky flying free

I wandered away from the dark crowded city,
Leaving my old life behind,
And I came to a place where a ring of bright water,
Dazzled all cares from my mind.

So I live with the wonder of the sky and the sea
And I'll always remember who revealed them to me

But now you are gone with your whirlpools of laughter
Leading me down to the sea
But I'll always smile when a ring of bright water
Echoes your laughter to me.

(key change)

But now you are gone with your whirlpools of laughter
Racing me down to the sea
But I'll always smile when a ring of bright water
Echoes your laughter to me.
Echoes your laughter to me
