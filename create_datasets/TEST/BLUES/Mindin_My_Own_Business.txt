I'm just mindin' my own business
Lord, and I'm leavin' other peoples alone
Yeah, I'm just mindin' my own business
Oh, and I'm leavin' other peoples alone

Oh, because I got plenty of trouble
Already in my home

Good book proudly tell you
You gotta reap just what you sow
Good book proudly tell you
You gotta reap just what you sow

I declare you gotta repay, hoo, Lord
I don't care why you go

Some men spend all their money on gamblin'
All in good time
Yeah, some men spend all their money on gamblin'
Baby, in good time

Oh, but why should I worry
When I do what I wanna do with mine
It take me six months to attend to my business
Six months to leave other peoples alone

Six months to attend to my business
Six months to leave other peoples alone
Yeah, by the time I do that
I declare the whole twelve months is gone
