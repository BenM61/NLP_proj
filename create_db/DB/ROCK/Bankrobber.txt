My daddy was a bank robber
But he never hurt nobody
He just loved to live that way
And he loved to steal your money

Some is rich, and some is poor
And that's the way the world is
But I don't believe in laying back
Sayin' how bad your luck is

So he came to jazz it up
Never learned to shovel
Break your back to earn our pay
Don't forget to grovel

My daddy was a bank robber
But he never hurt nobody
He just loved to live that way
And he loved to take your money

He's gone now

The old man spoke up in a bar
Said "I never been in prison
A lifetime serving one machine
Is ten times worse than prison"

Imagine if all the boys in jail
Could get out now together
Whadda you think they'd want to say to us?
While we was being clever

Someday you'll meet your rocking chair
'Cause that's where we're spinning
There's no point to want to comb your hair
When it's grey and thinning

Oh

Hey, my daddy was a bank robber
But he never hurt nobody
He just loved to live that way
And he loved to steal your money

So he came to jazz it up
We never learned to shovel
Break your back to earn your pay
And don't forget to grovel, hey

Get away, get away, get away, get away, get away, get away, get away

My daddy was a bank robber
But he never hurt nobody
He just loved to live that way
And he loved to steal your money

Hey
Run, rabbit run

Brrrp, strike out boys, for the hills
I can find that hole in the wall
I know that they never will

Daddy was a bank robber
But he never hurt nobody
He just loved to live that way
