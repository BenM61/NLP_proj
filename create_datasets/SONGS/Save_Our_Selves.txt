So this is how it's gonna be, you and me are history
We will never look the same but the end is coming
Your time is running out, the rain is pouring
So raise your voice and shout

This is a blackout and you'll find out
It's gonna come and take everything you love away
A blackout coming to your town
We'll never run away so stand and fight another day

So this is where it all began, this is where the story ends
We will never need to leave, we keep running
The walls keep coming down, this is a warning
So raise your voice and shout

This is a blackout and you'll find out
It's gonna come and take everything you love away
A blackout coming to your town
We'll never run away so stand and fight another day

Going out, going out, going out
Going out, going out, going out
Going out, going out, going out
Going out, going out, going out
Going out, going out, going out

Going out, going out, going out
Going out, going out, going out
Going out, going out, going out
Going out, going out, going out

Going out, going out, going out
Going out, going out, going out
Going out, going out, going out
Going out, going out, going out

This is a blackout and you'll find out
It's gonna come and take everything you love away
The blackout coming to your town
We'll never run away so stand and fight another day

This is a blackout, this is a blackout
