There once was a king of Paris
There once was an emperor of Brazil
There was maybe a Loch ness monster
There once was a buffalo bill
Now you can search the whole wide planet
Scratching in the mud and worms
But an honest politician
Is just a contradiction in terms

And if I had the keys to the kingdom
I'd hand them straight to you
In another time another place
Another life another waste
Sometimes the last thing you wanna know is the truth

With your bishops priests and mullahs
And all the mumbo jumbo clans
When you're not accepting women
How can you love your fellow man?
Well you can search the whole wide planet
Down to viruses and germs
A 'sensible' religion
Is just a contradiction in terms

And if I had the keys to the kingdom
I'd hand them straight to you
In another time another place
Another life another waste
Another love another lie
Another small way to die
Sometimes the last thing you wanna know is the truth
