Early in the morning
When the sun begins to shine
You will see this poor boy
Leavin', leavin' love behind
Seems it's just another day
Guess I'm goin' another way
Away from home

She was the cause of all the grief you see me wearin'
Nobody thought that we would ever split apart
Seems it was an open door
One that I've been through before
Away from home away, away from home
Away, away, I must go

I've done some livin' and for sure I'll do some dyin'
Her kind of woman almost makes me give up tryin'
Packed up everything I own, strapped it on my back
I'm goin' away from home, away, away from home
Seems what I've been looking for wasn't just an open door
I must go away, away from home

So movin' on along, I'll go
This old road is all I know, go
Away, away from home
Seems what I've been looking for wasn't just an open door
I must go away, away from home
So movin' on along I'll go

Away hey hey away from home
Away from home, away from home, away from home
Away from home away away
Down the road, down the road, the way I'm goin'
Away from home, Away from home
Down the road, down the road
Away from home
