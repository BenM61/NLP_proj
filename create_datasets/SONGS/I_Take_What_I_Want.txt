I take what I want, I'm a bad go-getter, yeah, yes I am 
I'm never a loser & I'm never bitter, yeah, oh no 
'Cause I take what I want, yeah yeah, baby I want you, yes, you 

I've been watchin' you walk by, & I haven't said a word, not one word 
But now I'm ready to get you & I'm gonna make you my girl, my lovin' girl 
'Cause I take what I want, yeah yeah, baby I want you 

Gonna pick you up now, carry you away, yes I am 
So you better pack up now baby, pack him up today 
Here I come, just a big bad man 
When I walk away, baby, you'll be holdin' my hand 

'Cause I take what I want, I'm a bad go-getter, yeah, yes I am 
But now I'm ready to get you & I'm gonna make you my girl, my lovin' girl 
'Cause I take what I want, yeah baby I want you 
Nobody but you, baby (Whaddya need now?) 
Nobody but you, your love to be by my side 
Your heart to be by my guide, told your mind 
I love you baby, nothin' but your soul
