(Are you trying to tell me that you will fight against me?) 
Oh you will win that too
For if you fail to silence me  you know what I will do

(What will you do physician?) 
I will go among the people  
And try to answer the questions that burn in their hearts 
The questions that I've asked myself  for all my life 
Wherever I've wandered in the world  and which were answered for me 
By a dying man  I will wear the clothes of a slave 

And kick the sandles from my feet, and speak to the wives 
As they fry their fish before their mud huts by the river 
To the porters on the docks, to the smiths by their belows 
To the slaves under the yolks, and I will say
