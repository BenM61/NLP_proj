I'm goin' back south in New Orleans
Get myself some of them cabbage greens
Ooh, them greens, yes, them greens
Oh, them greens, they call them cabbage greens

I love my cabbage like a horse likes grass
'Cause they is right in my class
Oh, them greens, yes, them greens
Oh, them greens, they call them cabbage greens

Beat it out, boy
I love my cabbage

Give me cabbage for my dinner, cabbage for my desert
Oh, when I don't get my cabbage, boy, how it hurt
Oh, them greens, yes, them greens
Oh, them greens, they call them cabbage greens

My wife woke up at night, hurts me in the side
Says, "Get up here, Daddy, I've got yo' cabbage fried"
Oh, them greens, yes, them greens
Oh, them greens, they call them cabbage greens

When you give me greens and don't give me no meat
Woman, you know that's one thing, knock me off my feet
Oh, them greens, yes, them greens
Oh, them greens, they call them cabbage greens
