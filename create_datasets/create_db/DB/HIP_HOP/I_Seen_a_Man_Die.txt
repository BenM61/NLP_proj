(So what you gonna do when you get outta here cat daddy?)
I don't know dawg, just trying to live it one day at a time, ya know?
(I hear you talkin' man, live it one day at a time, it ain't nothing but a thang though, bro
Yeah I hear you fool
Well let me get up outta here, my ride out here waitin' for me
(Alright cat, take it easy baby)
You stay up fool
(Peace)

He greets his father with his hands out 
Rehabilitated slightly, glad to be the man's child 
The world is different since he's seen it last 
Out of jail been seven years and he's happy that he's free at last 
All he had was his mother's worth 
Now she's gone and he's gotta make a change and make it for the beddah 
But he's back so he's got one strike against him 
And he's young plus he came up in the system 
But he's smart and he's finally makin' eighteen 
And his goal's to get on top and try to stay clean 
So he's calling up his homie who dun came up 
Livin' like this now they dealin' with the same stuff 
And had that attitude that who he was was worth it 
And with that fucked up attitude he killed his first mate 
Now it's different, he's in dead dirt 
And realized that the name ain't coming up but it still hurt 
And can't nobody change this 
It's nineteen-ninety-four and we up against the same shit 

I never understand why 
I could never seen a man cry, 'til I seen a man die 
Man cry

Imagine life at it's full peak 
Then imagine lying dead in the arms of your enemy 
Imagine peace on this earth when there's no grief 
Imagine grief on this earth when there's no peace 
Everybody's got a different way of endin' it 
And when your number comes for service then they send it in 
Now your time has arrived for the final touch 
I see the fear in your eyes and hear your final breath 
How much longer will it be 'til it's all done? 
Total darkness and ease be in all one 
I watch him die and when he dies let us celebrate 
You took his life, but your memory he'll never take 
You'll be headin' to another place 
And the life you used to live will reflect in your mother's face 

I still got to wonder why 
I never seen a man cry, 'til I seen a man die 

I hear you breathin' but your heart no longer sounds strong 
But you kinda scared of dying so you hold on 
And you keep on blacking out, and yo pulse is low 
Stop trying to fight the reaper just relax and let it go 
Because there's no way you can fight it, though you'll still try 
And you can try it 'til you fight it but you'll still die 
Your spirits leave your body and your mind clears
The rigor mortis starts to set, now you outta here 
You start your journey into outer space 
You see yourself in the light but you're still feeling outta place 
So you standing in the tunnel of eternal light, 
And you see the ones you never learn to love in life 
Make the choice let it go but you can back it up 
If you ain't at peace with God you need to patch it up 
But if you're ready close your eyes and we can set it free 
There lies a man not scared to die, may he rest in peace 

I still got to wonder why, 
I never seen a man cry til I seen a man die
