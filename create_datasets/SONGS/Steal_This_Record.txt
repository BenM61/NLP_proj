Just a product dressed to impress
Did you press a plastic abscess
Is there anything left - Rhetoric uninspired theft
It's all burning with nothingness - I'm so sick of your voices

The revolution will be telivised - Bought and sold and advertized
Who's the real charlaton - The pusher man pushin - Or did the writer lie
Your validity nullified - Do you consume the con - Do you sing along?
