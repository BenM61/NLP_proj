United we stand and divided we fall
Black man know yourself before your back is against the wall

Ah soh yuh stay
Yuh ongle ah tink one way
But I'm not a one way DJ
Coin two side, get that?
Hear dis

Shabba Rankin', reggae people's callin' out
People from east, west, north and south
Say, I'm the MC with the nasty mouth
Dem feel like is pure slackness alone I can talk about

I know me Roots and Culture
Who is the route Robert Nesta?
And Bunny Wailer follow after
It is music, mi charge for
Look how deh world noh stop suffer
What have black people under pressure

Some talk dis and some talk dat
Say everything from Shabba mouth is slack
I love roots and reality straight to the max
Because I'm a article oil abash

And some of dem waah people be vulgar

Make them listen to me like a pastor
