Yeah yeah yeah...yeah yeah... (x2)
Lemme talk to y'all fo a minute

I woke up this mornin, tried to get myself together
Gotta face anotha day, people laugh, smile in my face
Have to keep it movin, roll my spliff and sip my henny
Gotta clear my mind, time is precious, gotta stay on da grind

No one said that this life would be easy
So sick and tired of bein tired please believe me
No one said everyday I'd have to hustle
Everyday in my life seems like a struggle

On my way to the doctor, boy today is not my day
Got some mornin sickness, and my period is late
Am I hallucinatin, 'cause things ain't went my way since 
Back in da day, nobody said, that my life would be easy

No one said that this life would be easy
So sick and tired of bein tired please believe me
No one said, everyday I'd have to hustle
Everyday in my life seems like a struggle

In the end, I will always come out fighting
Keep it real, keep it movin, keep on grinding
You can't lose if you stay true, that I promise
'cause no one said, no one said...hey...

No one said that this life would be easy
So sick and tired of bein tired please believe me
No one said everyday I'd have to hustle
Everyday in my life seems like a struggle (x2)
