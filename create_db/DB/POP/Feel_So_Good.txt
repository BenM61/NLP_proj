So long...
I've been waiting so long
Just for someone like you
To happen along
And I know
Ooh, that I've been before
When I think of your smile
And I hear your song 

For you make me feel so good
(Make me feel so good)
Make me feel better than I thought I could
I hope that it's understood
I love you so much,
'Cause you make me feel so good 

Someday...
Ooh, I dreamed that someday
All the trouble and steam
Will be out of our way
I know...
Our time together's been short
Just believe what I say...
You remain in my heart...
There you stay 

You make me feel so good
(Make me feel so good)
Make me feel better than I thought I could
I hope that it's understood
I love you so much,
'Cause you make me feel so good 

You make me feel so good
(Make me feel so good)
Make me feel better than I thought I could
I hope that it's understood
I love you so much,
'Cause you make me feel so good
