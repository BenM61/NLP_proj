It all seemed to happen so fast
Will you ever believe the way he passed away
I saw his widow speak on her fortune
She was feelin' pretty apathetic 

Coax me, cajole me
Coax me, cajole me 

If I drink concentrated OJ
Can I think Consolidated's okay?
It's not the band I hate, it's their fans
Three cans of water perverts me 

Coax me, cajole me
Coax me, cajole me
Coax me, cajole me 

And after he died
By rights she'd have cried
I gave mine away
I gave mine away 

I saw a widow's peak on her forehead
It was full of lines and sinkers 

Coax me, cajole me
Coax me, cajole me
Coax me, cajole me
