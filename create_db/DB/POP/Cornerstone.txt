I am alone in a box of stone
When all is said and done
As the wind blows to the east from the west
Unto this bed, my tears have their solemn rest

I am lonely, alone in a box of stone
They claim to love me but they're all lying
I've been lonely alone in a box of my own
And this is the place, I now belong

It's my home, home, home, home home home home home
It's my home, home, home, home home home home home

It wasn't easy getting used to this
I used to scream
It's not true, that it's only when the door is locked
That nobody enters
'Cause mine had been open till your demise
But none had come, well who am I,
What have I done, what have I done?

I've been lonely, alone in a box of my own
They claim to be near me but they're all lying, it's not true
I've been lonely alone in a box of my own
And this is the place, I now belong

It's my home, home, home, home home home home home
It's my home, home, home, home home home home home

Friends, I have met
Lovers have slept and wept
Promises to stay had never been kept
This bare truth of which most won't share
I hope you share

'Cause I have been lonely
Alone in a box of my own
They claim to love me and be near me
But they are all lying
I have been lonely, alone in a box of stone
And this is the place I now I belong

It's my home, home, home, home home home home home
It's my home, home, home, home home home home home
