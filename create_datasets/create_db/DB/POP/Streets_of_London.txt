Now it's too late
The only thing that's left is a-wishing (Mmmm, oh yeah)
The lights have gone out in your house (Whoa)
And everybody's missing

I wonder if it's sunny in California (Oh Yeah)
California used to be my home (Ooh)
I've come so far from San Francisco
To walk these streets alone

I tried to sell my soul; nobody wants to buy it
Try to get my love to you, but you don't even want to try it
All my dreams are undone

In the Streets of London
(In the Streets of London)
In the Streets of London
(In the Streets of London)

I guess I knew
My eyes were blind by my command (Mmmm)
I could have reached out, pulled up the shades
Maybe it was all too close at hand

Ooh, so call me a clown
Let me play my charade for you
Pull my strings and watch me walk (watch me walk)
Down the lonely avenue

People passing by, I don't see their faces
Looking back behind me I can't even find the traces
All my dreams are undone

In the Streets of London
(In the Streets of London)
In the Streets of London
Oh (In the Streets of London)

In the Streets of London
(In the Streets of London)
In the Streets of London
(In the Streets of London)

In the Streets of London
(In the Streets of London)
In the Streets of London, yeah
(In the Streets of London)

In the Streets I'm
Walking the street going up and down
I'm acting like a fool and I feel like a clown
Oh, rain coming down on the avenue
I got nothing left to lose

In the Streets of London
(In the Streets of London, yeah)
In the Streets of London
I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm walking, yeah
(Ooh, in the Streets of London, yeah)
etc.
