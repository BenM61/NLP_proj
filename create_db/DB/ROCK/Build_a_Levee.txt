When I was just a little girl my mamma said to me
"Beware of the the devil my child in the dark rocky places he'll keep 
Beware of the devil my child Beware of his charming ways 
You'll fall under a spell just looking at his beautiful face 
You gotta build yourself a levee deep inside" 

"Don't go walking by the riverside alone in the pale moonlight 
He'll come up upon you girl with no earthly body in sight
Come up on you girl and and he'll whisper something sweet 
Then take you where the waters rise so high and run so deep" 

"You gotta build yourself a levee deep inside 
Gotta build yourself a levee deep inside 
Build yourself a levee girl when the waters run high" 

Now when I was just a little girl my mamma said to me
"Beware of the the devil my child but if by chance you should meet
Beware his cold dark eyes full of bold and unholy deceit 
He'll tempt you with a whirling pool of lies 
And promises he'll deny or that he will never keep" 

"You gotta build yourself a levee deep inside 
Build yourself a levee deep inside 
Build yourself a levee girl when the waters run high"
