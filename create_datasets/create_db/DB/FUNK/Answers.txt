Broken, down on my knees
I've been beggin' for peace for so long
Hoping that you would believe
All the words that I breathe from my lungs
I've been wrong, oh
But nobody alive can be right all the time
And I know, oh, I know

And all alone
I never opened my eyes to see
That all along
The answers were right there in front me

The answers, the answers
The answers are right there in front of me
The answers, the answers
The answers are right there in front of me
Been weighted down on the ground
By all of these questions, oh
The answers, the answers
The answers are right there in front of me

Hiding out from the light
When I needed it most, now I'm done
Lying about everything
That has led me to right here
And I've broken a promise, how soon we forget
That the ones that we love take the biggest hit
And I know, oh, I know

And all alone
I never opened my eyes to see
That all along
The answers were right there in front me

The answers, the answers
The answers are right there in front of me
The answers, the answers
The answers are right there in front of me
Been weighted down on the ground
By all of these questions, oh
The answers, the answers
The answers are right there in front of me

Tickin', it's tickin'
My mind is a time bomb, it's growin'
You know that I'm human, but I'm strong
I'll blow them away, more hungry as I grow
The voice that's inside of your head
Let it guide and let go
You're searching for answers
Stop looking down now
They're right where you plant them
We all have our days, we all have our ways
We all have the option to find them today

The answers, the answers
They're right there in front of me
The answers, the answers

The answers, the answers
The answers are right there in front of me
The answers, the answers
The answers are right there in front of me
Been weighted down on the ground
By all of these questions, oh
The answers, the answers
The answers are right there in front of me
