I lie awake on this phone call, 
She's dreaming of better days
Flowers lie on the counter, 
Remind her of better days

She sends a prayer up to Jesus
And she asks him for his strength
And the night will go on bleeding
Was it faith that paid the rent?

And I know you're barely listening
I know you're barely listening
I know you're barely listening
Now I know you're
I know you're barely listening
I know you're barely listening
I know you're barely listening
Now I know you're

Standing here in the doorway 
With a candle and a gun
The lights you threw open windows
For now the day has won

And I know you're barely listening
I know you're barely listening
I know you're barely listening
Now I know you're
I know you're barely listening
I know you're barely listening
I know you're barely listening
Now I know you're

Like a child on her way here
You just smile and run the other way
And faith won't find me a reason
It just smiles and runs the other way
And it just smiles
It just smiles and runs the other way
It just smiles
It just smiles and then runs the other way

It's not worth waiting

And I know you're barely listening
I know you're barely listening
I know you're barely listening
Now I know you're
I know you're barely listening
I know you're barely listening
I know you're barely listening
Now I know you're

You question love with a camera
And you're catching love with a will
Well heart lies in loneliness
Now fight the past can kill
