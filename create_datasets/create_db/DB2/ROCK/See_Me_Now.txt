Well I've been a lot places
I learned to tie my own tie too
I've met a lot of faces
I've got some questions I'd like to ask you

If you could see me now
If you could see my smile
See your little boy
Oh, would you be proud?

I've been in sticky situations
I fell in love with a girl who likes girls
I know mom's thinking of you
I'm busy trying to make it in this world
I hope I'm living your dream, daddy
Have a drink on me upstairs

If you could see me now
If you could see my smile
See your little boy
Oh, would you be proud?
If you could see me now
If you could see my smile
See your little boy
Oh, would you be proud?
If you could see me now
If you could see my smile
See your little boy
Would you be proud?

If you could see me now
If you could see my smile
See your little boy
Oh, would you be proud?

Well I've been a lot places
I learned to tie my own tie too
