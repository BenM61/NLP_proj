I know what life has done to you
Things haven't been too much fun for you
That's why you ran away
And now I'm all alone
I wasn't meant to be on my own
Turn back, turn back

And come and get me, oh, come and get me
Take me along
I don't care where you lead me, if you lead me
It can't be wrong
Just to be with you there's no place in this world
That I wouldn't go

This time isn't the time for you
You have to be where the skies are blue
And here the skies are gray
Darling, I understand
Don't you need someone to hold your hand?
Turn back, turn back

And come and get me, oh, come and get me
Take me along
I don't care where you lead me, if you lead me
It can't be wrong
Just to be with you there's no place in this world
That I wouldn't go

Oh please, won't you tell me where you've gone to, gone to?
If I knew where you were I'd be right there
I need something I want to be hangin' onto
Just to show me you care
