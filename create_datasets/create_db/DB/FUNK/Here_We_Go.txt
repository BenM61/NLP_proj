It's a lazy afternoon 
Just a kind of a day made for lovin' you 
Soon the evening breezes will start to blow 
Baby, grab your hat now 'cause here we go 

Ooh, I love the things you do 
And the way that I feel when I'm close to you 
I have dreamed so long, is it really so? 
Baby, grab your hat now 'cause here we go 

Off to wonderland... floating hand in hand 
Like in the movies 
everyone can tell that I'm in love with you 
I never knew what love could do 
My heart begins to pound whenever you're around 
I'm never coming down 
Oh No 

It's a quarter after two 
And there's no one around except me and you 
Well it's times like this that I'm living for 
Shall we turn the lights down and lock the door 
Baby don't stop... don't you dare no 
Just a little bit more we're almost there 
Any second now I'll explode 
Baby, grab your hat now 'cause here we go
