You overwhelm me, 
When you move your body next to mine
Won't you tell me
How you always know what's on my mind

It's a fever you know how to soothe 
And a calm contentment
Only you can get to

You overwhelm me
Oh babe I think you look so fine

I may be turned around
You'll show me the way
I may be tired of trying
You'll show me the light of day
My imagination is fired
I had only dreamt love could be so inspired

You overwhelm me
When you move your body next to mine
It's a fever you know how to soothe 
And a calm contentment
Only you can get to

You overwhelm me, baby
You fill my soul with desire
Only fools aren't afraid to be burned by fire
You overwhelm me, 
When you move your body next to mine
Won't you tell me
Oh babe I think you look so fine

You overwhelm me yeah
Won't you tell me
How you always know what's on my mind
