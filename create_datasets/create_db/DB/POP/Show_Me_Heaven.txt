Don't Ask
Show Me Heaven

There you go
Flashing fever from your eyes
Hey babe
Come over here and shut them tight

I'm not denying
We're flying above it all
Hold my hand
Don't let me fall

You've such amazing grace
I've never felt this way
Oh  show me heaven  cover me
Leave me breathless
Oh  show me heaven please

Here I go
I'm shaking just like the breeze
Hey babe
I need your head to steady me

I'm not denying
I'm frightened a much as you
Though I'm barely touching you
I've shivers down my spine, and it feels divine

Oh, show me heaven, cover me
Leave me breathless
Oh, show me heaven please

Do you know what it's like to dream a dream
Baby hold me tight and let this be
Oh, show me heaven, cover me
Leave me breathless

Oh, show me heaven please
