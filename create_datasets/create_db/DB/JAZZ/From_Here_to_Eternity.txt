You vowed your love
From here to eternity
A love so true
It never would die
You gave your lips
Gave them so willingly
How could I know
Your kiss meant goodbye?
Now I'm alone
With only a memory
My empty arms
Will never know why...
Though you are gone
This love that you left with me
Will live from here to eternity
Now I'm alone
With only a memory
My empty arms
Will never know why...
Though you are gone
This love that you left with me
Will live...
From here to eternity
