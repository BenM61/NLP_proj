And the air was alive
With piercing sound and burning skies
The horror did me good,
The magic was on my side
And hot and cold ideas
Were running onto your eyes
Your sinking grey eyes
She shook his head like so much meat
The horror did me good
Time to exercise 

Like ice about to melt
You empty yourself of everything
It's cold and grey again
Your body begins to fall
The color blinds your eyes
The flavor dulls your taste of anything
You try to break out,
But some thing's just locked the door 

[Repeat: x3]
(You'll get blue eyes
If you stand too close to him
And la la la la la
You die inside your dream)
I love you like you love me not
I love you like you love me not 

And the, exercise
