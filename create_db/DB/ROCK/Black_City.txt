I'm accused of being cold
With no emotions at all
Well I'm having a ball
I've got my motor running

I'm jumping with joy
Search and destroy
Come on come on come on
I've got my motor running

Nowhere you can hide
You won't leave this place alive
Cause the sun ain't gonna rise
The sun will never shine
In Black City

I've got smog in my brain
And gasoline in the veins
Get out of my way
I've got my motor running

Accused of being cold
Well I'm having a ball
Search and destroy
I've got my motor running

I use you as I please
The price you pay for walking my streets
Cause the sun ain't gonna rise
The sun will never shine
In Black City
