Lucille, you won't do your daddy's will
Lucille, you won't do your daddy's will
You ran off and married, but I love you still

Lucille, please come back where you belong
Lucille, please come back where you belong
I've beggin' to ya, baby, please don't leave me alone

I woke up this mornin', Lucille was not in sight
I asked my friends about her but all their lips was tight
Lucille, please come back where you belong
I've been good to you baby, please don't leave me alone

Lucille, baby, satisfy my heart
Lucille, baby, satisfy my heart
I played love with you baby, and gave you such a wonderful start
