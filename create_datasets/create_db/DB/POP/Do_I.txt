Someone said in a book I read
Love turns on like a light in your head
When it does, you can't see why
Just hold on tight, go for a ride

Life can change in a second or two
That's how it felt when I saw you
All I need is honesty
Tell me, baby...

[Chorus:]
Do I, do I
Do I feel like someone you could love? Yeah
Do I, do I
Do I feel like someone you could hold on to?
Am I the one
The one who makes you come undone?
Do I, do I?

Like a planet spinning around the sun
Something cosmic has begun
We won't swim against the tide
We'll just hold on tight, go for a ride

Lightning strikes in a second or two
That's how it felt when I saw you
I can't hold it back no more
Tell me, baby...

[Chorus]

Do I, do I?
(Do I, do, do I?)
Do I, do I?

Something happened when I met you
I can see in your eyes, you felt it too
I don't want to talk anymore
Be my baby

[Chorus]

Do I, do I?
Do I, do I?
