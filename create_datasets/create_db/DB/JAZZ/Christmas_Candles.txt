In the warm yellow glow of the Christmas Candles
I see the magic of Christmas shining bright, shining bright
Like the star that led the kings and shepherds
All to a tiny stable on that night, Holy night
With the lambs and the donkeys, cows and the camels breathing low

The perfect Child of God was born so long ago
In the dancing flame of the Christmas candles
I hear the whisper of angels soft and clear, soft and clear

As they watched in the night over Baby Jesus
I know they're watching me, always near, always near
I love the Christmas gifts and the trimming of the tree
Like the candles they remind us what Christmas really means

So, tonight as we light our Christmas candles
I'll hold the love of Jesus in my heart, in my heart
And keep the flame where the spirit of Christmas starts
