They call me the juice
The no chicken lover
A gigglo at night
Dats always in trouble
I cruise around the city
I'm rollin' up the sticky
I'm ridin' 22's and I love big titties
Gel and weave, gel and weave
If she from the hood then she down wit me
She got gel and weave, gel and weave
Wit a big round ass I'm yo man to be
As I'm rollin' down the block
A player gotta beep
That said "I want to f*ck"
A two way freak
Her name is Rhonda Peary
Who works at the dairy
Her chewin' is da bomb
But her face looks scary
I'm pushin' down the street
Tryin' to make it to her house
And then I gotta beep from my freak named Minnie Mouse
They call her Minnie Mouse
She live a couple trees
She eat a lot of cheese
If you hit she'll squeak

She's a two way freak, a two way freak
She goin' threw your people when she know you asleep
She's a two way bitch, a two way bitch
She wastin' up your characters and ain't talk about shit
She's a two way freak, a two way freak
She beamin' up your boys for her own private creep
She's a two way bitch, a two way bitch
She wastin' up your characters and ain't talk about shit

Early in the mornin'
My two way is jumpin'
Wit da petty want some boys
Daddy want nothin'
Wastin' up my characters
You don't have to pay thus
I ain't got no time for no whatchu doin' unless it's just
Goin' to the bathroom
Two way on the TV
Come back, it's my baby daddy tryin' to see who's beepin' me
Dog that's a no, no
Get yo stuff you gotta go
Scrollin' threw my two way is like scrollin' threw my cash flow
Look jack, in the club
Boys they be tryin' to holla
Don't know how to act
Gotta two way on yo collar
Askin' can you get a beep
Hell naw, not at all
You'll be dat dude dat'll make me throw my junk into the wall
How you get yo business
Some times its for playas yo
I can make exceptions when you want to spend dat chedda
If you want to hit me up
Make sure daddies worth a hit
Or you when like you responded I don't mess with two-way tricks

She's a two way freak, a two way freak
