Sometimes the comfort of a room
Sometimes I'm quite alone 
I pack to leave a foreign town 
It seems I'll never know 
But I'll rent new accommodation 
We'll make plans from mobile homes 

The slow boat's moving with the tide 
Drifting far from shore 
It's the nature of this country life 
I've never known before 
Still we'll make plans for buildings and houses 
From mobile homes 

Plant life 
My life 
Still life in mobile homes 

The sound of wildlife fills the air 
So warm and dry 
The bushland burns in this southern heat 
Like an open fire 
Still we'll make plans for buildings and houses 
From mobile homes 
In mobile homes 

Plant life 
My life 
Still life in mobile homes 

A voice screams from heaven 
As we start to sail 
It's the going of the fatherland I used to know so well 
Still I'll find new accommodation 
We'll make plans from mobile homes 

Plant life 
My life 
Still life in mobile homes
