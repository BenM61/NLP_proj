Look out for the land rush, it's coming day by day.
Said, get ready for the land rush, it's headed right your way.
Look what you're paying, to live on your land,
And most folks don't even have some, but I don't understand.

Spread the news across the land, and just do the best you can,
All we've got is just the land; take a stand, save the land.

Sometimes I sit here thinking, but all the answers just don't appear.
I'm calling to my brothers and sisters, let's get together and kill this fear.
There ain't really gonna' be much to it. we can control the thing if we try.
With just a little more understanding, the whole world will get by.

Spread the news across the land, and just do the best you can,
All we've got is just the land; take a stand, save the land.

Spread the news across the land, and just do the best you can,
All we've got is just the land; take a stand, save the land.
