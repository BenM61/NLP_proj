In the days, the golden days,
When everybody knew what they wanted
That ain't here today

Through the times of last and low
And stop the things trying the past day
They don't feel the same

Dreams, so believe they come
Time, life it self goes on

From beyond the shoupion skies
The money talks and leaves us hypnotized
Don't pay the way

Underneath the fading sun
The silent song of a business man
Has left us choking

Dreams, so believe they come
Time, life it self goes on

In the days, the golden days,
When everybody knew what they wanted
It ain't here today

Dreams, I believe they've gone
Time, life it self goes on
