Do you still feel the same way about it
Like you always said you would
Or has time re-written everything
Like you never dreamt it could
Remember when we wanted to fly forever
On a magic carpet ride
Well forever seems a long time
Cutting us down in size
No matter how hard we try

And I could see all I had done
Just chasing dreams across the fields
In the shadow of the sun

I plan to have it all while I'm still young
And chase the fields across my dreams
In the shadow of the sun
In the shadow of the sun

Once upon a time I might have told you
But now nothing seems that plain
However much we're changing
There are some things the same
And those same things still say

And I could see all I had done
Just chasing dreams across the fields
In the shadow of the sun

I plan to have it all while I'm still young
And chase the fields across my dreams
In the shadow of the sun
In the shadow of the sun
