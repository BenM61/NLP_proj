Weight of love on my shoulders
I thought that it would be easier than this
I found my heart had grown colder
But the warmth of your kiss, I can't dismiss

Though my past has left me bruised
I ain't hiding from the truth
When the truth won't let me lie right next to you

But it's holding on
And it's holding strong
Even though I tried to make it
Played the part, but I can't fake it
It keeps holding on
And it's holding strong
Even though I tried to break it
Heaven knows that I can't shake it
But it's holding on
And it's holding strong
Even though I tried to make it
Played the part, but I can't fake it
It keeps holding on
And it's holding strong
Even though I tried to break it
Heaven knows that I can't shake it

Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
It keeps holding on and on
It keeps holding on and on
It keeps holding on and on
It keeps holding on and on

I've seen times that were harder
I remember the taste of bitterness
Won't you help me, my father?
Help me fall in the love that I have missed

Though my past has left me bruised
I ain't hiding from the truth
When the truth won't let me lie right next to you

But it's holding on
And it's holding strong
Even though I tried to make it
Played the part, but I can't fake it
It keeps holding on
And it's holding strong
Even though I tried to break it
Heaven knows that I can't shake it
But it's holding on
And it's holding strong
Even though I tried to make it
Played the part, but I can't fake it
It keeps holding on
And it's holding strong
Even though I tried to break it
Heaven knows that I can't shake it

Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it,
It keeps holding on and on
It keeps holding on and on
It keeps holding on and on
It keeps holding on and on
Sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
(It keeps holding on and on
It keeps holding on and on
It keeps holding on and on
It keeps holding on and on)
