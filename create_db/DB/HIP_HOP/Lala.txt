Hi Kevin

What's the point? Lala da da da
What you mean? Lala da da da
All those words, lala da da da
In one ear and out the other one

Moving slow, eyes low, cup full, blunt rolled
I don't even know where I land
You know I get money so, when they see me flexin'
They can't do nothin' but act like a fan
I don't do word to mouth, watch what you say
Or I make sure that you can't say it again
New city, new show, baby take it slow
You might never see me again
Yeah

What's the point? Lala da da da
What you mean? Lala da da da
All those words, lala da da da
In one ear and out the other one

I've seen angels cry, I've seen demons dance
Baby take a picture, make the moment last
Weed residue all over my designer pants
That's my old flow, you could have that
I don't look at the pricetag, I just ring it up
I got these bitches so mad, now they teamin' up
You gon' get what you lookin' for if you keep it up
People always got a problem but they never speakin' up
