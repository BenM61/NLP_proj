I've been missing you for so many days
I keep wanting you, Lord, in so many ways
I can't get you off of my mind 
But true love is so hard to find 

I want yet another day
Ooh, I need another day
Darling, let me have another more day 
And I can be anything that you want me to be, now 

The sweet things you used to do to me
Sometimes, Lord, you used to say them to me
I can't forget those lovely days 
But this is the price I'm about to pay 

Ooh, I want another day
You can let me have just one more day
Ooh, I need one more day 
And I will do anything that you want me to do, now

I will do anything that you want me to do, now
Say anything that you want me to say
Buy you anything you want me to buy 
And I can cherish you till the day I die 

If you let me have another day
Please let me have one more day
Ooh, I want just one more day, Lord
And it could be anything that you want it to be 

Ooh no, ooh
Just one more day now 
You can let me have just another day, now 
Please I want to stay and the day after and the day after 
And I want all the days 
I want all the days 
I want you here
I want you here by my side
And I don't want you to leave me 
And I can love you long for the rest of my life 
I cry and cry and cry and cry and cry, oh my Lord

Please, let me have just one more day, oh my
Just another day, just another day
I want all the days
Let me have, let me have all my days, my days
I need 'em, I gotsta, I gotsta, I gotta
I gotta have just all the days, I need 'em
