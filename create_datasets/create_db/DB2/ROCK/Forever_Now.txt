Taking her seat at the bar
She don't talk to anyone
Plane leaving soon for afar
Where she don't know anyone
She thinks of her precious time
There's no-one she leaves behind
Who could change her mind

Is this the way it's gonna be forever
Is this the way it's gonna be forever
Is this the way it's gonna be
Forever now

Take a whole life's loneliness
Wrap it up in some tenderness
Send it off to some emptiness
With all my love
'cause it's only you and me
There'll be nothing we need to see
Only one thing can set you free
Is all my love

Making his way down the stairs
He can't help but looking back
Thinks of the things that they shared
There'll be no more turning back
He thinks of the day they met
The words that she said of love
He just can't forget

Just the way they want to be forever
Just the way they want to be forever
Tell me it will always be
Forever now

Take a whole life's loneliness
Wrap it up in some tenderness
Send it off to some emptiness
With all my love
It's only you and me
There'll be nothing we need to see
Only one thing can set you free
Is all my love
It's only you and me
There'll be nothing we need to see
Only one thing can set you free
Is all our love, oh yeah
