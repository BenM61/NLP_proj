If I sent a rose to you
For every time you made me blue
You'd have a room full of roses
If I sent a rose of white
For every time I cried all night
You'd have a room full of roses

And if you took the petals
And you took them all apart
You'd be tearing at the roses
Just the way you tore my heart

If someday you're feeling blue
And you could send some roses too
Well I don't want a room full of roses
I just want my arms full of you

And if you took the petals
And you took them all apart
You'd be tearing at the roses
Just the way you tore my heart

If someday you're feeling blue
And you could send some roses too
Well I don't want a room full of roses
I just want my arms full of you
