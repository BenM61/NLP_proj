Somebody gon' snatch you so I gotta make you mine quick fast
See I come and pass, I don't really wanna wonder
So I gotta put her numbers on my sidekick fast
Rollin witcha mob workin' hard, gettin' money, pullin' capers
If I ain't got papers you will bring me some beans home
Supervisor givin' orders on the job
But you still lookin' good with them skin-tight jeans on
Lookin' hot in them heels, I think I want that
Come and back it up to the bottom of my throwback
With you rollin' yo' rims lookin' like a Kodak
Watch I drive I wanna smoke, she will roll that
Miss mobstress rollin' with the hardest
Holdin' it down like a female Joe Pesci
And I wanna make her a made woman
And I hope she gon' let me, cause she looks so sexy

Oh! And this is for them girls that be wantin', dutty
And this is for them girls that be lovin', dutty
And this is for them girls that be ridin', dutty

Met a chick, lookin' fine and her measures was

Ain't no reason to be scared of us
Lovin' how you do your own thang
And how you smokin' on your own flame
Lookin' finer than a girl that be groovin' on Soul Train
I try to to hit her with some cold game
I hope she, feel me, try to holla at a shorty
Get a better vibe wit her while I'm sippin' on my, Henny
I wanna kiss her on her body
But I gotta make her holla while I'm givin' her, dutty
Gotta really love a girl
They know to kick it but she know she gotta make that, money
Goin' shoppin' for the minks and the leather
But come back and bounce that ass, for me
My East coast girls, that's what's up
Tell my South side shorties we can get it crunk
My Cali girl make it bounce like a six-fo'
My Chi girl bust down, make it straight buck
When I see up all the girls that get down for hers

Career woman with some goals, f*ck the broke-ass hoes
Baby girl cause you look so sexy
