Well I fought for you
I fought too hard, to do it all again
It's gone too far
You never needed me, you only wanted me around
It gets me down

[Chorus]
There's been a change
Yeah there's been a change of heart
I said there's been a change
You pushed just a little too far
Made it just a little too hard
There's been a change of heart

I'll get over you, it won't take long
I've stood in your gallery
I've seen what's hangin' from the walls
You were the moon and sun
You're just a loaded gun now
It gets me down --

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, oh boy looks like we finally hit the turning point --
Oh me, oh my looks like it's time for me to kiss it goodbye

[Chorus]
