Imagine the sun
Lazy on a deep blue sea
And I cry for the sailor man
And I cry to be free

Fire on the beachhead
Reflecting deep blue sea
And we sail from the mainland
And we sail to be free

Whisper softly spoken
Echoes from behind
Shall we stay until the morning
Shall we sail on the tide
