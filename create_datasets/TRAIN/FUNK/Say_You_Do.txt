If you love me, say you do
If you want me, say you do
If you need me, say you do
If you love me, say you do

Your body chemistry, your history, your smile
I like it, I like your style
Magnetic mystery, your hypnotistic child
I'm knee deep, You drive me wild

If you love me, say you do
If you want me, say you do
If you need me, say you do
If you love me, say you do

So electrifying, you soon might just blow my fuse
Love skipper, it's you I choose
I'd buy a trip, desire, systematic smooth
I'm hooked up, I'm hooked on you
