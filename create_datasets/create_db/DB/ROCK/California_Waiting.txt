Little Mona Lisa laying by my side
"Crimson and Clover" pullin' overtime
I feel too close to be losin' touch
By givin' in, what am I givin' up
Am I losin' way too much

Hey
California waiting
Every little thing's gotta be just right
Say
While you're tryin' to save me
Can't I get back my lonely life

I'm goin' so fast that I can't slow down
It's hard to get up when you're spinnin' round and round
I'd give you the the news but nothin's changed
I'd sing you a song but they blew it away
All wrapped up in this stupid ass game

Hey
California waiting
Every little thing's gotta be just right
Say
While you're tryin' to save me
Can't I get back my lonely life
Hey
California waiting
Every little thing's gotta be just right
Say
While you're tryin' to save me
Can't I get back my lonely life

Hey
California waiting
Every little thing's gotta be just right
Say
While you're tryin' to save me
Can't I get back my lonely life

Can't I get back my lonely life
Can't I get back my lonely life
