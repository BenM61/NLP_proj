New power, new power, give it to me
Oh, it need some bottom in here lay it on me

(Hey now, hey now)

Everybody on the block say it is the best
The most vital is what they say, more or less
It put my name upon my thigh
It makes me dance, it makes me cry
And when I touch it race cars burn rubber in my pants

This feeling's so good in every single way
I want it morning, noon and night of every day
And if by chance I can not have it I can't say
But with it I know heaven's just a kiss away
Kiss away

Dig me now

Anyone that's ever touched it
They don't want anything else (no they don't)
And I got to tell the world
I just can't keep it to myself
All in life becomes easier
No question is unresolved
And I'm not afraid

Come on and touch it, I know you will love it
With it I know that heaven's a butterfly kiss away

This feeling's so good in every single way
I want it morning, noon and night of every day
And if by chance I can not have it I can't say
But with it I know heaven's just a kiss away
Kiss away

Lovesexy

Lovesexy

Rain is wet, sugar is sweet
Clap your hands, stomp your feet
Everybody, everybody knows (lovesexy)
When love calls, you got to go

Lovesexy

Tonight we make love with only words
Girls first, girls first
Ok so like first I'll start by telling you how
Intelligent a curve your behind has
And then I can tell you that I can just smell you
And race cars burn rubber in my pants
But I really dig trippin' on the thought of
Being caught by someone with your beauty, style and grace
Baby I don't care I would rip out my hair
For just two nights with your face
I don't want to make love to you
I just want to look at you
I just want to listen to you

Oh, pretty little whip, you got me drippin'
Drippin' all over the floor, the floor
If I come back as a woman, I want a body like yours
A body like yours

Living rooms
I think I think you would
I think you want to play house
Yeah, I think you want to play house

Lovesexy

You don't mind
I think you uh
I think you want me toinside of you
Yea yeah I

You want (lovesexy) me to suck around your living room
Ha ha
Yeah, you you want me to walk right down your halls

Mmm hmmm
Lovesexy

You want me to swivel in your love seat
Don't you baby?

You want me to write my name on your walls
You want me to write my name

Lovesexy
We make love with only words
I'll make love to you, tomorrow

Sweet dreams
