She makes the place a jumpin'
The way she move around
She like a romp and rollin'
That when she get it out
And when she start a rockin'
She bring me to the boil
She like to give it up some

New satellite blues (new satellite blues)
New satellite blues (new satellite blues)

The dish is running hot
The box is set for pumpin'
She gonna take the lot
The way she get the butt in
She's gettin set to ball
I like to chew it up some

New satellite blues (new satellite blues)
New satellite blues (new satellite blues)

New satellite blues (new satellite blues)
New satellite blues (new satellite blues)

Can't get nothing on the dial
The frickin' thing's gone wild
All I get is the dumbed down news
New satellite blues
Yeah

New satellite blues (new satellite blues)

New satellite blues (new satellite blues)

New satellite blues (new satellite blues)
