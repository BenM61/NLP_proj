He's a man
Gonna do what the can to make this world a decent place
He's a man
Got a great little plan on how to give it a brand new face
He wants to erase
He wants to replace
He wants to wipe the scum of the earth off its pretty face

Didn't wanna be just another voice with an answer
He'd seen it done before and turn into a cancer
But he was a chancer
Way romancer
He had such great planes
To get the damn deal done
