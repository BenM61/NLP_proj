I'm gettin out and steppin' in 
To somewhere where it's warmer 
First come will be first served 
You'd better put in your order 

Been out in the cold far too long 
Gonna set the town on fire (fire) 
If you're not with me you better step aside 
This boy's out for the kill kickin' higher 

Oh, forty eight hour parole
But I got to be a good boy 
Oh, forty eight hour parole 

Toein' the line ain't my style 
And I ain't looking for trouble 
I wasn't born, I was carved out of stone 
So don't try bustin' my bubble 

Oh, forty eight hour parole
But I got to be a good boy 
Oh, forty eight hour parole
