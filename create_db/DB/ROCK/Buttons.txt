She told me, 'I've been missin' you.'
We's a-leaving
She said, stay
She kissed my lips and quickly ran away

Lost some buttons to my overcoat
Pull your knife away from my throat
She said, 'smoke your cigarette, I hope you choke'
Kissed my lips and quickly ran away

I shake, I shake
I can never see
How good a young love could really be
I know, I know
It's not that bad
Take a look at what we had

Walked you home from the park
I held your hand, it was after dark
Hold me closer, she'll always stay
She kissed my lips and quickly ran away

Lost some buttons to my overcoat
Pull your knife away from my throat
She said, 'smoke your cigarette, I hope you choke'
Kissed my lips and quickly ran away

You shake, you shake
I could never see 
How good young love could really be
I know, I know
It's not that bad
