After all, the broken stones
That were thrown, for no good reason
Inside, she's loving him still
After all this time
And though her heart, begs the stars
No sign of healing, it's all right
She's loving him still, after all this time.

Oh yeah

Trying to push the past away
Still waiting for the lights to change
Try, try for the sake of it
Learning to barely feel the pain
Thicker the skin the less the strain
And though it's really hurting
She ain't breaking, breaking, breaking
Coz she's loving him still, after all this time

Now he knows his weakness shows
Selfish soul, never changing
That's fine, because she's loving him still
After all this time

And to the outside eye
You see you found a different guy
And it all seems perfect, and that's how she wants it
Coz she's loving him still, after all this time.

Trying to push the past away
Still waiting for the lights to change
Try, try for the sake of it
Learning to barely feel the pain
Thicker the skin the less the strain
And though it's really hurting
She ain't breaking, breaking, breaking
Coz she's loving him still, after all this time

After all this time
After all, after all, after all this time

Bones have to grow, and age it shows
Though we try and hide it
Inside, she's loving him still
After all this time
And behind his tired eyes, she sees the boy with his arms wide

Who made her feel like an angel
Oh that's why she's loving him still
For the rest of her life, she's loving him still
For the last of many miles
She's loving him still
After all this time
