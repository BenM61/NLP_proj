Goin' Where the Wind Blows
Mr. Big

Someone said life is for the takin'
Here I am with my hand out, waiting for a ride
I've been living on my great expectations
What good is it when I'm stranded here and the world just passes by
Where are the signs to help me get out of this place

If I should stumble on my moment in time how will I know
If the story's written on my face does it show
Am I strong enough to walk on water 
Smart enough to come in out of the rain
Or am i a fool going where the wind blows

Here I sit halfway to somewhere 
Thinking about what's in front of me and what I left behind
On my own its supposed to be so easy
Is this what I've been after or have I lost my mind
Maybe this is my chance and its coming to take me away

If I should stumble on my moment in time how will I know
If the story's written on my face does it show
Am I strong enough to walk on water 
Smart enough to come in out of the rain
Or am i a fool going where the wind blows
(Bridge:)
Here I am what can make it through the world
Taking up space society's shadow
Make room for me, make room for me, make room for me

If I should stumble on my moment in time how will I know
If the story's written on my face does it show
Am I strong enough to walk on water 
Smart enough to come in out of the rain
Or am i a fool going where the wind blows
