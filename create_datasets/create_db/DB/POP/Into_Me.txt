Like a little girl, little girl 
In another bad dream 
I'm wakin' up
You're still next to me
When I go away, go away
When I turn the key 
I'm petrified
No, please don't leave
'Cause I'm finally starting to believe

That you're not, you're not
Going anywhere, anywhere
No, you're not, you're not
Going anywhere, anywhere
Yes, I'm finally starting to believe
That you're into me

Am I found out, found out
Oh, can you see
I'm trapped in a world
I can't get free
And you're the, you're the, you're the only thing
That can save me now
I'm in too deep

'Cause I'm finally starting to believe
That you and me and this thing it's really happening

And you're not, you're not
Going anywhere, anywhere
No, you're not, you're not
Going anywhere, anywhere

You're not, you're not
Going anywhere, anywhere
No, you're not, you're not
Going anywhere, anywhere

And yes, I'm finally starting to believe
That you're into me

Me the beast
Me the flower
Me the dragon in my tower
Me the bull with my horns 
You give it all and I want more
I want more
And I want more
I want more
I want more
And I want more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more

And you're not, you're not
Going anywhere, anywhere
No, you're not, you're not
Going anywhere, anywhere

You're not, you're not
Going anywhere, anywhere
No, you're not, you're not
Going anywhere, anywhere

And yes, I'm finally starting to believe
And yes, I'm finally starting to believe
That you're into me
