There's a hole in the soul of happyland
We stay high in our castles made of sand
There's a church where we go to numb the pain
We messed up and I know you feel the same

And it goes on and I don't understand how we became a one-man band
Oh Lord, I guess we all fucked up, woah

Come to happy, happy, happy, happyland 
Happy, happy, happyland
Happy, happy, happyland 
Happyland
Happy, happy, happyland 
Happy, happy, happyland
Happy, happy, happyland

There's a scar in the heart of happyland
And the shadows are where we used to stand
So we sleep and we dream but our dreams don't mean a thing, oh
We could run but we're puppets on a string

And it goes on, I guess we all fucked up, woah

Come to happy, happy, happy, happyland 
Happy, happy, happyland
Happy, happy, happyland 
Happyland
Happy, happy, happyland 
Happy, happy, happyland
Happy, happy, happyland
Happy, happy, happyland

And it goes on and I don't understand how we became a one-man band
Oh Lord, I guess we all fucked up, woah

Come to happy, happy, happy
Happyland
Happyland
Happyland 

Now we all wanna be happy (happyland)
No matter what we do we (happyland)
We all wanna be happy, oh
In happyland
