Woo

If you don't know how I feel for you
It's time I let all feelings show
I love you and I'll never
Let you go, no, baby

Right now we're just friends
But baby I pray some you'll surrender to love so tender
I won't push you
As long as you know that my love is true

Get closer to you, baby, hey
Closer than just friends
I want to get closer to you, baby, hey
Closer than just friends

How about you?
How about you?

It's hard to explain when you're close to me
I get a warm sensation inside
I can't deny this, I want to try it
Each and every time you come by

Girl, I don't wanna lose your love
By putting my cards on the table, you know I'm thankful
For what we have
But I have feelings inside, they're so strong, I can't hide

Get closer to you, baby
I want to get closer than just friends
Get closer to you, baby, yeah
Closer than just friends

How about you?

I know you're probably thinkin'
That you heard this so many times before
But, girl, when you're here
I want you to stay
And when you're gone
I want you even more every day

Girl, I don't wanna lose your love
By putting my cards on the table, you know I'm thankful
For what we have
But I have feelings inside, they're so strong, I can't hide

Get closer to you, baby (No, baby)
Closer than just friends (They're so strong, I can't hide)
Get closer to you, baby (How 'bout you get closer, baby)
(How about you?)

Get closer to you, baby (How about you?), hey
My baby, my baby
Whoa...whoa...to you, lady, hey...yeah...
Closer than friends

Me and you, woo
I want to
How 'bout, 'bout you
Whoa...oh...

Nothing I won't do
To get close to you, baby, yeah
