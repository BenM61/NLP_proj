Do you feel anything at all? 
Do you hear steps at the door? 
Do you reckon the smell of...? 
It's life - the the dark that binds you 

Frightened by your own smell 
Bitterness will run you through 

Silent screaming 
Turning, twisting the alphabet 
Frantic eyes 
Awaiting the answer 
Splinters of a poem 
Fragments of what you used to be 
Habitual and gullible 
Run-down memoirs is all that's left 

Do you wish to sleep? 
Do you aim for the shadow? 
Do you feel infected? 
It's life the the dark that binds you 

It's the cowardice that pulls you under 
And takes you to the end, where it begins 
Release, the world is waiting on your arrival 
Close your eyes, as we witness another bullet ride 

Do you know about atrocity? 
Do you that everybody's gone? 
Do you know that you're on your own? 
It's life - the the dark that binds you
