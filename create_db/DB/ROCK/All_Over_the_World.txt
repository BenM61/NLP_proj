Everybody all around the world, gotta tell you what I just heard
There's gonna be a party all over the world

I got a message on the radio, but where it came from I don't really know
And I heard these voices calling all over the world

All over the world, everybody got the word
Everybody everywhere is gonna feel tonight

Everybody walkin' down the street, everybody movin' to the beat
They're gonna get hot down in the U.S.A.
(New York, Detroit, L.A.)

We're gonna take a trip across the sea, everybody come along with me
We're gonna hit the night down in gay Paris

All over the world
Everybody got the word
Everybody everywhere is gonna feel tonight

All over the world

All over the world
Everybody got the word
Everybody everywhere is gonna feel tonight

Everybody all around the world, 
Gotta tell you what I just heard
Everybody walkin' down the street,

Everybody gonna have a good time, 
Everybody will shine till the daylight

All over the world, everybody got the word
Everybody everywhere is gonna feel tonight
