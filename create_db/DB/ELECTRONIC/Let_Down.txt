I had a job in about a year,
Living down in my parents base-ment. 
I wish that I could get out of here,
Sometimes I think I need a vacation

Get my mother off my back
She won't go far to go and drive me crazy,
Some day that bitch is gonna make me crack,
Might be the last time she calls me baby.

I'm a letdown, Pardon me?
If I'm a letdown, don't have a family.
I'm a let down, uh 1, 2, 3!
If I'm a letdown, are you like me?

And now my sisters got a fancy car,
I've got a piece of shit from 1980
But at least I've got my two guitars
A one way ticket to nowhere Baby!

I'm a letdown, Pardon me?
If I'm a letdown, don't have a family.
I'm a letdown, uh 1, 2, 3!
If I'm a letdown, are you like me?
Are you like me?
Are you like me?
Oh yeah, yeah! 

Now I've got a dream, 
You don't understand.
It won't be long,
I'm not what I've seen, 
See I've got a plan.
That's right!

I have to act like I don't exist,
Or else they treat me like I'm slim to nothing.
There is no resentment more than this
When we're done I might be 27!

I'm a letdown, Pardon me?
If I'm a letdown, don't have a family.
I'm a letdown, uh 1, 2, 3!
If I'm a letdown, are you like me?
Are you like me?
Are you like me?!
