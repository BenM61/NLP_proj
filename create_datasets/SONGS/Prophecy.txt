A living giving corpse so weak
A sacred path where do we fall
Desired anguish fear of life
Makes martyrs of us all

Delusioned prayers fill the air
A hopeful soul is hard to see
Human cruelty frozen in time
A world so hard to feed

Nothing seems to matter
The rain begins to fall
Nothing to believe in
Even angels learn to fall

A trantic march into the sea
Being hunted to extinction
This human bond of frail mortality
A tarnished ground of true conviction

A teardrop falls behind closed walls
There's so much more of life to see
The closing of the door
The mind and so much more
A broken moment to believe

Torment and anger
Runs through my veins
Leaving me cold inside
Surrender your feeling

Unfolding is the veil
Turning love to despair

This anger
A silent rage
This anger
A silent rate
