You are mine
Haven't I told you so
You are mine
Even the angels know

I thought you knew
It's only you
Yes, you are mine

I loved you the
First time that we met
Then I knew that
I could not forget
All that we shared
How much I cared for you

Now, I may not be a poet
Who can tell his love with words
But I'm sure my heart will show it
That I am asking you

To be my wife
Love me eternally
And be my life
Please be a part of me

Then I'll possess
Life's happiness
When you are mine

Oh oh, be my wife
Love me eternally
And be my life
Please be a part of me

Then I'll possess
Life's happiness
When you are mine
When you are mine
