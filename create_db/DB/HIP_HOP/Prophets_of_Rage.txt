With vice I hold the mic device
With force I keep it away of course
And I'm keeping (keeping)
You from sleeping (sleeping)
And on stage I rage
And I'm rolling (rolling)
To the poor I pour in on in metaphors
I ain't bluffin', it's nothin'
That we ain't did before
We played you stayed
The points made
You consider it done
By the prophets of rage
Can you kick it like

Clear the way
Clear the way
Clear the way
Clear the way for the prophets of rage
Can you kick it like

Clear the way
Clear the way
Clear the way
Clear the way for the prophets of rage

When choice became the people's voice
Shout loud
Put your hands up in the crowd
Raise your fist up (fist up)
While I lift up (lift up)
Fucking everything wrong with the system (system)
People hungry and dyin'
They ain't got a home
This is the nature created
From the terrordome (terrordome)
Let's turn the page
Shaman burn the sage
Clear the way for the prophets of rage
Can you kick it like

Clear the way
Clear the way
Clear the way
Clear the way for the prophets of rage
Can you kick it like

Clear the way
Clear the way
Clear the way
Clear the way for the prophets of rage

I roll with the punches so I survive
Try to rock cause it keeps the crowd alive
I'm not ballin' (ballin')
I'm just callin' (callin')
But I'm past the days of yes y'allin' (y'allin')
Wa wiggle round and round
I pump, you jump up
Hear my words my verbs
And get juiced up
I been around a while
You can't describe my sound
Get down for the prophets of rage
Can you kick it like

Clear the way
Clear the way
Clear the way
Clear the way for the prophets of rage
Can you kick it like

Clear the way
