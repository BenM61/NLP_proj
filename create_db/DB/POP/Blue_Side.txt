It's the same old me
In the same old clothes
Same old face
That you're sure to know

Same old blue side of me, baby
With the same old love for you

It's the same old day
In the same old week
I got the same old shivers
Won't you sail away with me?

Same old blue side of me, baby
With the same old love for you

Oh, the blue side is the true side
For anyone who's had a broken heart
And the blue side is the you side
'Cause you won't give this love another start

Got the same old legs
In the same blue jeans
In the same old head
Lies the same old dream

Same old blue side of me, baby
With the same old love for you

And the blue side is the you side
'Cause you won't give this love another start

It's the same old blue side of me, baby
With the same old love
It's the same old blue side of me, baby
With the same old love for you, ooh
