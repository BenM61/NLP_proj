You can find me, in St. Louis rollin' on dubs
Smoking dubs in clubs, blowin' up like cocoa puff
sippin' Bud, gettin' perved and getting dubbed
Daps and hugs, mean mugs and shoulder shrugs
And it's all because, accumulated enough stretch
Just to navigate it, fully decorated on chrome
And it's candy painted, fans fainted
While I'm entertaining, wild ain't it
How me and mugs, I hang with Hannibal Lector (Hot Shit)
So feel me when I bring it, sing it loud wha
I'm from the Loop and I'm proud
Run a mile for the cause
I'm righteous above the law
Playa my style's raw
I'm "Born to Mack" like Todd Shaw
Forget the fame, and the glamor
Give me D's wit a rubber hammer
My grammar B's ebonics, gin tonic and chronic
F*ck bionic it's ironic, slammin' niggas like Onyx
Lunatics til the day I die
I run more game then the Bulls and Sonics

Hey I'm, ready to cut you up any day now
Play by, my rules boo and you gon' stay high
May I, answer yo third question like hey I
Say hi, to my niggas left in the slamma'
From St. Louis to Memphis
From Texas back up to Indiana, Chi-Town

All my niggas wit Country Grammar
Smokin' blunts in Savannah
Blow thirty mill like I'm Hammer
