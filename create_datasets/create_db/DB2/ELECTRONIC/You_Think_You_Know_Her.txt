Like Children
Rarely seen and never heard
Emotion
Bare your soul you'll never learn
But don't ask why
And you won't get lied to
Speak other softly
It's something you get used to
You Think you know Her
But you never really
Lived a life without her
Couldn't tell me
The things she said
The books she read
The way she walked when the morning came
The time of night that you held her tight
But you'll never forget the day she'll ran away
I found her all alone lost in a crowd
Hen she saw me
I felt so much i cried aloud
She turned away
I couldn't speak to stop her
The only sound i heard
Was the echo of her laughter

You Think you know Her
But you never really
Lived a life without her
Couldn't tell me
The things she said
The books she read
The way she walked when the morning came
The time of night that you held her tight
But you'll never forget the day she'll ran away
I found her all alone lost in a crowd
Hen she saw me
I felt so much i cried aloud
She turned away
I couldn't speak to stop her
The only sound i heard
Was the echo of her laughter
You Think you know Her
But you never really
Lived a life without her
Couldn't tell me

The things she said
The books she read
The way she walked when the morning came
The time of night that you held her tight
But you'll never forget the day she'll ran away
