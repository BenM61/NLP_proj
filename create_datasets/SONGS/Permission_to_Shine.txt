Hey, what would you say
If I can't play the hero tonight
'Cause lately I've been feelin' like
I can't get anything right

I've been fading into the woodwork again
And I'm feelin' like I just want to hide
But guess what
I'm gonna try something just a little bit different this time

I'm gonna give myself permission to shine
I'm gonna shine so bright
Gonna make every head want to turn
You're finally gonna see me
Give myself permission to shine
Gonna light up the night
Shine a little of my light on the world

I've been crazy
I've been holdin' myself back for so long
But I've got so much I can give
Don't want to be afraid to be wrong

You know I'm not too good at too many things
But I've been gettin' real good at gettin' down on myself
But guess what
I'm gonna try to break free from this prison I"ve built

I'm gonna give myself permission to shine
I'm gonna shine so bright
Gonna make every head want to turn
You're finally gonna see me
Give myself permission to shine
Gonna light up the night
Shine a little of my light on the world

Oh, that's right
I'm gonna try something just a little bit different this time

I'm gonna give myself permission to shine
I'm gonna shine so bright
Gonna make every head want to turn
You're finally gonna see me
Give myself permission to shine
Gonna light up the night
Shine a little of my light on the world

(Give myself permission to shine)
I want to light up the night
Shine a little of my light on the world
