They say what you don't know - won't hurt you
And I believe that's so - so don't tell me
That you've found someone new
To go through life with you
Because I love you - my darling
My dearest - I love you
You're the one I want nearest me
I love you - and I hope that you love me too
I'd rather die thinking you love me
Than to go on through life without you
And you with someone new 
To go through life with you
Because I love you - my darling
My dearest - I love you - I love you
You're the one I want nearest me
I love you - I love you - and I hope that you love me too
