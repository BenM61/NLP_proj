Staring at the sidewalk, there's a crack in which a flower grows
Reminded me of somebody not hangin' around here anymore
And everything is so pretty 
Pretty fucked up, obvious
When you call me from the other side to tell me everything is fine and I will always love even when your eyes are fading
And if they catch you, I will save you, I will get you out

And this, what about this?
Is it anything at all, is it a growing cancer in your heart
And this life I don't have a clue
But when they told you not to worry, didn't it bother you?
Well all that's very nice but this is the song against life

Where do all these people come from, 
Where do all these words belong?
A never-ending bible, everything they say is our command
And everybody wants the same, everybody here wants nothing,
Grow up to be a millionaire is all there is
Well all that's very nice but this is the song against life 

He goes out in the kitchen, he goes there every second
And your plastic father said:
"It's just too boring standing here all day"
And went out for a lover
Or a new world to discover
And the watertower threw its shadow over your house
And this, what about this? is it anything at all?
Is it a growing cancer in your heart?
And this life I don't have a clue
But when they told you not to worry, didn't it bother you?
Well all that's very nice
But this is the song against life
