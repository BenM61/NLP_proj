You're my Heartbeat of life
And you fill up my mind
I wanna stay close, close to you

It's the old lover's spell
That you weave oh so well
Oh at least hold to me
Oh you got to see

I just want to hang around you
Every day and night
All of my life around you
I just want to hang around you
Every day and night
All of my life around you
Hang around you

I get so Hypnotized
When I look in your eyes
Oh you can co control me

I feel all butterflies
When I'm right here by your side
Oh I need your touch,
Can't get enough
Love Me
Oh you've got to see

I just want to hang around you
Every day and night
All of my life around you
Hang around you

Spending every moment of my life
Within your gaze my forever love
To have you and to hold you
So you never ever need to use
Your crystal ball
To know where I'll be, always

I just want to hang around you
Every day and night
All of my life around you
Hang around you

All I want to do is hang around you

I just want to hang around you
Every day and night
All of my life around you
Hang around you

All I want to do is hang around you

I just want to hang around you
Every day and night (everyday and night)
All of my life around you (all of my life around you)
Hang around you
