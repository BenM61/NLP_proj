Receiving you
The games we ever knew now
Now get the pain
My heart's receiving you
Inviting me
The scares we ever knew now
Now get the pain
Your heart's receiving me

If I could save the love I found
Every move and every sound
To get you closer
(To get you closer)
To get you closer
If I could dance on holy ground
Every groove and every sound
To get you closer
(To get you closer)
To get you closer

Believing you
The dunes we ever knew now
Now get the pain
My heart's believing you
Forgiving me
The stars we ever knew now
Now get the pain
You heart's believing me

If I could save the love I found
Every move and every sound
To get you closer
(To get you closer)
To get you closer
If I could dance on holy ground
Every groove and every sound
To get you closer
(To get you closer)
To get you closer

Now get the pain
You heart's believing me

If I could dance on holy ground
Every groove and every sound
To get you closer
To get you closer

If I could save the love I found
Every move and every sound
To get you closer
(To get you closer)
To get you closer
If I could dance on holy ground
Every groove and every sound
To get you closer
(To get you closer)
To get you closer
