So dark and deep
All the shadows on the wall
They seem as real
As dali's creatures, great and small

My hope is gone
All my demons come to call
From disk 'till dawn
I look for shelter from it all

My life's so confused
And I try to stumble through the day
My mind's abused
All these thoughts forever stay
