In the land of San Domingo
Lived a girl called Oh By Jingo
From the fields and from the marshes
Came the young and oh by goshes

They all spoke with a different lingo
But they all loved Oh By Jingo
And every night, they sang in the pale moonlight
Oh by gee by gosh by gum by jove

Oh By Jingo won't you hear our love
We will build for you a hut
You will be our favourite nut
We will have a lot of little Oh By Gollies

And we'll put them in the follies
By Jingo said "By gosh by gee
By jiminy please don't bother me"
So they all went away singing

Oh by gee by gosh by gum by jove By Jingo
By gee, you're the only girl for me.
Oh by gee by gosh by gum by jove
Oh By Jingo won't you hear our love

We will build for you a hut
You will be our favourite nut
We will have a lot of little Oh By Gollies
And we'll put them in the follies

By Jingo said "By gosh by gee
By jiminy please don't bother me"
So they all went away singing
Oh by gee by gosh by gum by jove By Jingo

By gee, you're the only girl for me.
