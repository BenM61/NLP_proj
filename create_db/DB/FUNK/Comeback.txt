[Chorus:]
I got that comeback, that hubba bubba
I got that run back, run back and tell your mother
I throw that RA-RA, only I put it all the way down
I got a lifetime warranty, guaranteed you'll never leave

Warning, beware, handle with care
If you're lucky, there's a chance you'll make it there
This is serious; girls like me are so rare
Ones that put that on him, put that on him
Put that, put that, put that on him

Now, I know what I'm doing; what chu gon' do with this?
I'll let you catch a feeling with just a little bit
Don't wanna rush into it and catch a sugar fit
Ones that put that on him, put that on him
Put that, put that, put that on him

[Chorus]

Caution, keep away from open flames 
'Cause it's hot, hot, hot, fire marshals can't contain it
You'll need rehab 'cause this thing is so addictive
Ones that put that on him, put that on him
Put that, put that, put that on him

The hazard lights are flashing, and you're now too close behind
I won't give you directions; you better read the signs
I'll reach my destination; you better fall in line
Ones that put that on him, put that on him
Put that, put that, put that on him

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
(Don't ask no questions) Don't ask me questions of what you thinking I'm 'bout to do
Don't get all clingy on me after I'm finished with you
I'll let you taste this honey, but you better have a clue
Or I ain't coming back to you

[Chorus]

Thinking it's the wrong truth?
You can go away now, but you gonna return
Thinking it's the wrong truth?
You can go away now, but you gonna return
You're gonna return to me
Ones that put that on him, put that on him
Put that, put that, put that on him

(Hey! Yeah! Yeah!)

Ones that put that on him, put that on him
Put that, put that, put that on him
