Forget your troubles and your aggravations
We're gonna have ourselves a celebration
Forget your worries and any sorrow
We're gonna dance like there is no-no tomorrow
Whatever the hang up
We're getting a gang up
And we are gonna have us some fun

I-if you're worried and fu-you'll of trouble
Come on do-own and it will pop like a bubble
I-if your problems are caused by heartbreak
Come and join us you'll forget all your heartache
Whatever the hang up
We're getting a gang up
And we are gonna have us some fun

Is everybody happy
We're gonna have some fun
Is everybody happy
Well everybody have a lotta
Everybody have a lotta fun

If you're surrounded by clouds of thunder
Don't let it get ya and pull-you'll you under
You gotta fight it and learn your lesson
Or you will end up in deep deep depression
Whatever the hang up
We're getting a gang up
And we are gonna have us some fun
