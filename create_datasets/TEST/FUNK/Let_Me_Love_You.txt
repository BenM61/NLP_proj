Maybe time and space will run and continue on like
Einstein said
And maybe time travel might even be possible, but long
After we're dead
Maybe the sun revolves around the earth, we don't
Think it do
Maybe serendipity brought you here to meet me to you
Maybe for a sudden my woman said this thing here can't
Possibly last
And maybe, just maybe I want somethin' more from you
Than to get some ass
Maybe there are things you could put me through
Maybe we should do the things that lovers do

So let me love you with all that I've got
Let me love you from the top to the bottom, from the
Bottom to the top
Let me hold you, touch you, tease you, please you
Let me love you

Maybe April showers don't bring me flowers, it's all
Been a lie
Maybe the sky ain't blue and maybe Tiger might lose
And babies don't cry
And maybe my felonious and trained weren't really that
Good
And maybe everyone that didn't place or show didn't
Give it all they could

Maybe foresight is tellin' you that this here thing
Can't last
And maybe, just maybe I want somethin' more from you
Then to get some ass
Maybe there's some things I might put you through
Maybe we should do the things that lovers do

So let me love you with all that I've got
Let me love you from the top to the bottom, from the
Bottom to the top
Let me hold you, touch you, tease you, and please you
Let me love you

My brothers help me see
That maybe this is heaven sent (Maybe this is heaven
Sent)
Maybe this could be as good as it gets (Maybe this
Could be as good as it gets)
Maybe this is everything you need and more (Everything
You need and more)
Maybe all that I've been waitin' for (All that I've
Been waitin' for)
Maybe this is just the way that it should be (Just the
Way that it should be)
I got you standin' right in front of me (Standin'
Right in front of me)
Maybe there are things you will put me through
But maybe you were made for me and I was made for you

Let me love you, yes, with all that I've got
Let me love you from the top to the bottom (Bottom to
The top), hey (You're all I got)
Love you, oh, with all that I've got
Let me love you from the top to the bottom (Bottom to
The top), oh (You're all I got)
Let me love you, let me love you, let me love you,
Baby
