Don't be surprised if I'm ripping out my eyes
I'm on fire
I said don't be surprised I'm ripping out my eyes
I'm on fire

We break
We break too easily
We pull all the breaks
You break too easily

Don't be such used until you know the truth
I'm on fire
Don't be such used until you know my truth
I'm on fire

We break
We break too easily
We pull all the breaks
You break too easily

I break too easily
I break too easily
I break too easily
I break too easily
I break too easily
We break too easily
We break too easily
You break too easily
We break too easily

We break too easily
You pull all the breaks
You break to easily
I pull all the breaks
I pull all the breaks too easily
I pull all the breaks
I pull all the breaks too easily
