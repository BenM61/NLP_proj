You know I'm always looking fly
Never wear the same outfit twice
I don't even have to try
Bitches better recognize
Won't catch me waiting in a queue
In and out, merci beaucoup
I like boys with attitude
Skinny jeans and good tattoos

It's boring in the VIP
Everybody watching me
When the DJ plays it loud
Make my way down to the crowd

When the bass kicks in
We're not too cool to dance
We're not too cool to dance
We're not too cool to dance
We don't care if no one understands
No one understands
We're not too cool to dance

Got this tan in Monaco
Got these bangs in Tokyo
Went there for a fashion show
Yogi sat me in front row
Champagne kisses bubbly
If you take me home you can cuddle me
Platinum lightening in my eyes
Got my mind on my money and my money on my mind

It's boring in the VIP
Everybody watching me
When the DJ plays it loud
Make my way down to the crowd

When the bass kicks in
We're not too cool to dance
We're not too cool to dance
We're not too cool to dance
We don't care if no one understands
No one understands
We're not too cool to dance

Too cool to dance
Too cool to dance
Too cool to dance
Too cool to dance

When the bass kicks in
We're not too cool to dance
We're not too cool to dance
We're not too cool to dance (we don't care)
We don't care if no one understands
No one understands
We're not too cool to dance

When the bass kicks in
We're not too cool to dance
We're not too cool to dance
We're not too cool to dance (we don't care)
We don't care if no one understands
No one understands
We're not too cool to dance

Come on baby, now
Let me show you how
Come on baby, now (We're not too cool to dance)

Come on baby, now
Let me show you how
Come on baby, now (We're not too cool to dance)

We're not too cool to dance
