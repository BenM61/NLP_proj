Nothing in common
You hate the movies I like
You hate my hair
I hate your clothes
Everything's wrong
But that's all right

Change your mind
It's last call soon
Your place or mine?

Gimme the night to talk with you
Gimme the night to sleep with you
Gimme the night, I promise you
It's no big thing I do this all the time

I got a feeling you're like me
A damaged package filled with uncertainty
You hate those awkward breakfasts for two
But that don't matter, I hate them two

Change your mind
It's last call soon
Make up your mind

Gimme the night to talk with you
Gimme the night to sleep with you
Gimme the night, I promise you
It's no big thing I do this all the time
