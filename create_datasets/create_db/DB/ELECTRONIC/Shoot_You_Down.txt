You know it
You show it
And the time has come
To shoot you down
What a sound

When the day is done
And it all works out
Id love to do it and you know youve always had it coming

You know it
You show it
And the time has come
To shoot you down
What a sound

When the day is done
And it all works out

Id love to do it and you know youve always had it coming

I never wanted
The love that you showed me
It started to choke me
And how I wish Id said
No too slow
I couldnt take
That too fast

I want you to know

You know it
You show it
But I cant back down
Its far too late
I cant wait
Now the time has come
Itll all work out
And when this
Thing is done
Itll leave no doubt

So when youve
Had your fun
Will you all walk out? 

Id love to do it and you know youve always had it coming
Id love to do it and you know youve always had it coming
Id love to do it and you know youve always had it coming
