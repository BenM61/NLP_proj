Love and happiness... 
something that can make you do wrong, make you do right... 
Love... 

Love and happiness 
Wait a minute... 
something's going wrong 
someone's on the phone 
three o'clock in the morning 
talkin' about how she can make it right 
well, 
happiness is when you really feel good with somebody 
nothing wrong with being in love with someone 
oh, baby, love and happiness 
love and happiness... 
love and happiness... 

Love and happiness 
You be good to me 
I'll be good to you 
we'll be together 
we'll see each other 
walk away with victory 
oh baby, 
love and happiness... 
love and happiness... 

Make you do right... love'll make you do wrong... 
make you come home early... 
make you stay out all night long... 
the power of love... 

wait a minute, 
let me tell you... 
the power of love... 
make you do right... love'll make you do wrong... 
make you want to dance... 
love and happiness... 
love and happiness... 

love is... wait a minute... love is... 
walkin' together... 
talkin' together... 
say it again... 
say it together... 
Mmmm....
