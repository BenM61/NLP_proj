Jenny Neale 
Down in Beale
Gave her papa the air
Left him cold 
Got him told 
Said she didn't care
Old Joe, her beau 
Looked just like he would die
If you was near him
You would hear him 
Sob his mournful cry

Beale Street Papa
Why don't you come back home? 
It isn't proper to leave your mama all alone! 
Sometimes I was cruel, that was true
But Papa, you know Mama never two-timed you! 
Boo-hoo, I'm blue
So how come you do me like you do? 
I'm cryin'! 
Beale Street Papa, don't mess around with me! 
There's plenty pettin' that I can get in Tennessee
I'll still get my sweet cooking, constantly
But not the kind you served to me
So Beale Street Papa, come back home! 

So how come you do me like you do? 
I'm cryin'! 
Beale Street Papa, don't mess around with me! 
There's plenty pettin' that I can get in Tennessee
I bought a rifle, razor and a knife
A full support [?] can't save my life 
So Beale Street Papa, come back home!
