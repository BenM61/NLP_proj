There's a jealous girl in our town 
Ohh, baby 
Fellas 
There's a jealous girl in our town 
Ohh, baby 

I know you feel about 
Me and my girl 
But I gave you the first chance to 
Be in my world 

Now you are saying things 
To keep us apart 
You had the very chance to 
Be in my heart 

When I loved you, you didn't love me 
Our love had no unity 
All you ever told me were lies 
It's my girl I know you despise

Ohh, baby 

Girl I really hope you find another 
I just can't take no more 
Of you tryin' to be my lover 
(Ooh) 

You see 
I've got what I want 
And what I need 
So girl 
Won't you please try 
Just to leave 

When I loved you, you didn't love me 
Our love had no unity 
All you ever told me were lies 
It's my girl I know you despise

Hey girl

Why are you so jealous? 
I mean, you had your chance 

If you loved me so much, you wouldn't let me go 
(Let me go) 
Face it girl 
It's time for someone else 

All those times when I tried to show you how much I loved you 
And how much I cared for you 
You never seemed to have the time 
(I let go) 

Girl it's hurtin' me 
As much as it's hurtin' you 
But that's just how life goes 
You win some 

You lose some 
Sweatheart 
Point blank 
You lost this one 

I just want to let you know that it's hurting me so 
Girl I just had to let you go
