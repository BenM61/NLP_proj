We stay moving around, solo
Ask us where you at, we don't know
And don't care (Don't care)
All we know is we was at home 'cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone
And left us all alone
Now she in the club with a freaky dress on
Cats don't want her to keep that dress on
Trying to get enough drinks in her system
Take it to the tele and make her a victim
Patron on the brain, ball player in the face
They shake the spot, she's just another case

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone (Gone)
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason
Don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad
We die forever

He's staying with a flock of them, oh, yeah
Got a girl at home but he don't care
Won't care (Won't care)
All he'll do is keep me at home, won't let me go nowhere
He thinks because I'm at home I won't be getting it on
And now I'm finding numbers in the jacket pockets
Tricks calling the house, non-stop its
Getting out of control
Finally I can't take no more
He finds a letter on the stairs, saying this is the end
I packed my bag and left with your best friend

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone (Gone)
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason
Don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad
We die forever

We stay moving around, solo
Ask us where you at, we don't know
And don't care (Don't care)
All we know is we was at home 'cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone
And left us all alone

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone (Gone)
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason
Don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad
We die forever

We gone forever
We gone forever
