It's the visiting king  supreme  all heal kiss the ring 
Into a ?  I blow steam from the families of the Mackabees 
Smack emcees watch them scream your majesty  make them suffer 
The capacity of tragedy  hold the crowd down like gravity 
Back the f*ck off  stop grabbing me  hands off me  niggas start to 
Bore me 

I'm getting sleepy  I need some coffee, me and my wu-bandits 
We carry niggas deep in the canvas, body bandage, like some mummies 
You fucking dummies, you can't take nothing from me 
It's the longest waited, the most anticipated, the album amputated 
Scream the name out Killah Priest, I leave the blood filling in the 
Street 

I'm from the dark hills of Brownsville, the seven shields on windmills 
Across the killing fields, never forget it, tell them rap critics 
I speak in horrific, so they can never get it, I'm too scientific 
Lyrics explicit, I roll with thirsty niggas, theifs and killers 
Tigers, gorillas, faces like godzilla 

We stomp rappers and smile like a Calm-Della, we got iller 
Cross my heart both hope to die, we multiply, by the hundred 
Fuckin' by the thousand, leave me out ? so grounded 
Beatin' up your soundman 
Playa haters and players, we give um' cold stares 
Any last prayers

Yo, Yo, concrete techniques, bomb beats and cause causalities 
My facalty, hold it down like gravity, rapidly 
Sweatin' like weapons to adolescence, ghetto residence 
Quick to pass since your present, state of the slum 
Kill 4 play the drums 
Face 1, their course was now, the snake tongue, I'm deep into this 
I sometimes gasp for air, deadly warfare 
Hot block cop and gold stares, shots clear 
They fire was on July the 4th, weapons get torn, fugitive slidin' off 
My force is combined, new world, 2009 
Digital, criminals you'll make meals in cyber-crime 
Let's all plan ahead, 2 times, I keep the chimes to a great mind 
The head that you take, you're not blind

[Chorus]
We stare you eye to eye 
We tell the truth no lie 
We cross our heart and hope to die, hope to die

High ranked officials and armed tanks with missiles, blood drizzle 
Simple fact, you slept on the issue, that B-boy started jerkin 
Joysticks a Sega, I was rockin' off 100 watt amps in ?, 2 fine tune it 
Ship enough units, emcees ask, who be those rhyme killers in mask 
No doubt, difficult task, the last in the square, beware 
Infinite amount of darts is in the air, I'm victorious 
With no opponents, I blast through components, with micro-phonics 
Watch the whole world live the moment, anything in time 
Became approaching this, are incompatible of speech, remains motionless 

[Chorus: x2]

Hope to die
