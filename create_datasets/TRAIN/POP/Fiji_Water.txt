Got an email at twenty-two
Told me I could be a star
On a plane for the first time
I couldn't wait to start

Landed at JFK
Father Christmas picked me up
Checked-in to a dream hotel
And I thought "There's no such thing as luck"

I walked in to my interview
And I thought "There's no such thing as luck"
And oh, if I only knew then what I know now
I'd stand like a one man band
And I'd say "All this is new to me, but here's how it's gonna be"

And I'd say "Hey, there is more to me than meets the eye
Let me be who I wanna be"
And I'd say "Hey, I'm an oddity and that's alright
Let me fly and follow my dreams"

And I'd say "Hey, thanks for the weekend
A good time was had by all"
And I'd say "Hey, thanks for the weekend
I ain't a smooth-talker but thanks for the Fiji Water"

"Thanks for the Fiji Water"
 
Dinner under a palm tree
I had so much on my mind
Amazed by the bright lights
I stayed up half the night

And boy, I took a leap of faith
With nowhere else to go but up
I walked in to my interview
And I thought "There's no such thing as luck"

And oh, if I only knew then what I know now
I'd stand like a one man band
And I'd say "All this is new to me, but here's how it's gonna be

And I'd say "Hey, there is more to me than meets the eye
Let me be who I wanna be"
And I'd say "Hey, I'm an oddity and that's alright
Let me fly and follow my dreams"

And I'd say "Hey, thanks for the weekend
A good time was had by all"
And I'd say "Hey, thanks for the weekend
I ain't a spin doctor but thanks for the offer"
 
And "By the way, hey, thanks for the weekend" ('cause no one does it like you do)
"You know I had a ball" (it was nice to meet you)
And I'd say "Hey, thanks for the weekend
I ain't a smooth-talker but thanks for the Fiji Water"

"Thanks for the Fiji Water"

I laughed when I got back home and I thought
"There's no such thing as luck"
