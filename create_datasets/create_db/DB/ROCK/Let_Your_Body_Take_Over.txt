Breathe, this is what we live for
So take me by surprise and never say a word
Oh, oh, you know, your lips, your eyes, your skin
They paralyze me

Come on, come on
Under and over
Through the back door
Make your way over

I've been meaning to ask you
A few things on my mind
You know it's never so hard
When you're this close to the ground

This is the way I feel
What do you say? Be real
Your body's never felt so alive

This is the way I feel
What do you say? Be real
I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself

Let me in, let your body take over
Let your body take over your soul
It's for the passion, for the love, you've never laughed
You've never loved, you've never been loved

I've been meaning to ask you
A few things on my mind
You know it's never so hard
When you're this close to the ground

This is the way I feel
What do you say? Be real
Your body's never felt so alive

When this passion's got me
Be careful, be gentle, I'll go slow
Don't end the night like this
Don't end the night like this
