A sultry haze hangs in the air
A lightning storm cuts through the sky
Thunder, the master, calling for the clouds
Thunder, your master, summons you to this place

Boldly tread this fearless path
Don't fear the giant's wrath

Over the mountains
The sun rises up
A castle of gold
Shines through the clouds

The gods awaken
Out of their dreams
Crossing the vally
To the rainbow bridge

Valhalla
Valhalla
Valhalla
Valhalla

Shrouded from the pale cold night
In the east you'll see its blinding light
From Dusk to Dawn, in peace and serenity
Follow the King and dwell with me

Boldly tread this fearless path
Don't fear the giant's wrath

Over the mountains
The sun rises up
A castle of gold
Shines through the clouds

The gods awaken
Out of their dreams
Crossing the valley
To the rainbow bridge

Valhalla
Valhalla
Valhalla
Valhalla
