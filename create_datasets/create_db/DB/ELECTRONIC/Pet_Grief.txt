 And then he's gone
Never put up a fight
You think you know someone, right?
Maybe you never did, and how that scares you
I'll shut my mouth for you
Just like your friend would do

And this pet grief
It's just too bad
I've never seen you this sad
And if you need someone who doesn't talk back
I'll shut my mouth for you
Anything you want me to

What can I say?
What can I do?
Don't mean to analyze you
It is a double bind
I can't win this one
I'll shut my mouth for you
Anything you want me to
