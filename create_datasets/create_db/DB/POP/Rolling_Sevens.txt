I was tired of letting her
Taking me for what she could get
Smoking me down
Like her last cigarette

See luck's a dime in dozen
In a thousand different places
Every country cousin's
Holding five sweet aces
All of a sudden
Love shines down on me

Kissing you is like the angels kissing heaven
When I roll those dice, I swear I'm rolling sevens
I'll do whatever you want, whatever you say
Everything's going our way

Poets and philosophers
Can say what they like
But they've never been to your place
After the clock strikes midnight

Zooming in on you
Pulled me into focus
All the wild cards
Start turning into jokers
All of a sudden
Love shines down on me

Kissing you is like the angels kissing heaven
When I roll those dice, I swear I'm rolling sevens, sevens
I'll do whatever you want, whatever you say
Everything's going our way, yeah

Kissing you is like the angels kissing heaven
When I roll those dice, I swear I'm rolling sevens
I'll do whatever you want, whatever you say
Everything's going our way, yeah

Rolling sevens, rolling sevens, rolling sevens
Our way, yeah, rolling sevens, rolling sevens, yeah

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, seven
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, seven
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, seven
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, seven, seven
