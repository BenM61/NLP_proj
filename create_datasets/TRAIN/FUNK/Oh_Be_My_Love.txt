Love's a puzzle
I say, love's a puzzle
Sometimes confusing as can be
But we'll work it out 
And I know you'll discover 
The beauty of love's mystery

Oh, be my love
Come, let the work begin
Oh, be my love
Love's puzzle we can blend
Oh, be my love
We'll fit the pieces in
I know we'll fit the pieces in
I know

Jagged edges, such as heartbreak
Can drive you slowly out of your mind
It don't seem to fit
Go, honey, don't you quit
There's just harder love designs

Oh, be my love 
Come, let the work begin
Oh, be my love
Love's puzzle we can blend
Oh, be my love
We'll fit the pieces in 

I know (ba, ba-da-la-da-do, ba, ba, ba-da)
I know (ba, ba-da-la-do, ba, ba, ba-da)

Ba, ba-da-la-ba-do, ba, ba, ba-da
Ba, ba-da-la-ba-do, ba, ba, ba-da-la-do

Ah, ah, ah, ah ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah ah

Oh, be my love 
Come, let the work begin
Oh, be my love
Love's puzzle we can blend, come on
Oh, be my love
We'll fit the pieces in
I know (ba, ba-da-la-ba-do, ba, ba ba-da)
You'll fit the pieces in (do, ba, ba, ba-da)
(ba, ba-da-la-ba-do, ba, ba, ba-da-la-do)

Oh, be my love
Be my love, yeah
Come, let the work begin
Oh, be my love 
Love's puzzle we can blend, yea
Oh, be my love 
We'll fit the pieces in 
I know (ba, ba-da-la-ba-do, ba, ba, ba-da-la-do)
