If you're all alone
Just get on the phone and call on me
If you're feeling blue
All you have to do is call on me

If you feel you want somebody around
Someone to laugh with or cry
Call on me, call one me, woh, woh, woh
You can call on me

You will understand
When I touch your hand so tenderly
I don't want to have to tell you
When to call on me

If you feel you want somebody around
Someone to laugh with or cry
Call on me, call one me, woh, woh, woh
You can call on me
