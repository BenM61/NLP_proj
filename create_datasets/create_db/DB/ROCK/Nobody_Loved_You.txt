What's your story baby
No control of what I am saying
Winter leaves still make me believe
No vendettas, just a cherry blossom tree

Never had the chance to take you home
Now there's no reason just another tomorrow
You keep giving me your free air miles
What would I give just for one of your smiles
Just for one of your smiles

Nobody loved you, nobody made you feel so alone
Nobody loved you, no no
Nobody loved you, nobody made you feel so alone
Nobody loved you, no no

Let me turn down all these lights
And sit with me then you can hold me tight
Give me some more of your carrier bags
And let me dream of a new autumn light

Tell me your story baby
What's your poison and what is your honey
You've stopped me hurting but so much disorder
Winter flowers did you ever forgive her
Did you ever forgive her

Nobody loved you, nobody made you feel so alone
Nobody loved you, no no

Cherry blossom tree, but at least you are free
Nobody loved you, like me

It's unreal now you're gone, but at least you belong
Nobody loved you, no no

What's your story baby
No control of what I am saying
Winter leaves still make me believe
No vendettas, just a cherry blossom tree
Just a cherry blossom tree
