Remember those days, the early nineties?
We both applied for places
At the same university
Ended up in London
Where we needed to be
To follow our obsession
With the music scene
Wherever we went
Whatever we did
We knew the songs

They called us the Pop Kids
'Cause we loved the pop hits
And quoted the best bits
So we were the Pop Kids
I loved you
We were the Pop Kids
I loved you
They called us the Pop Kids

I studied history
While you did biology
To you the human body
Didn't hold any mystery
We were young but imagined
We were so sophisticated
Telling everyone we knew
That rock was overrated
We stayed out 'til late
Five nights a week
And felt so chic

They called us the Pop Kids
'Cause we loved the pop hits
And quoted the best bits
So we were the Pop Kids
I loved you
I loved you
They called us the Pop Kids

(Remember those days?
Remember those days?)

It was a wet Wednesday night
We worried that no one would be going out
How wrong we were!
When we turned the corner
There was already a queue stretching down the street
We swept straight in and you said
Ooh, I like it here
Ooh, I love it
Ooh, I like it here
Ooh, I love it
Ooh, I like it here
Ooh, I love it
Ooh, I like it here
Ooh, I am never going home

I loved you

They called us the Pop Kids
'Cause we loved the pop hits
And quoted the best bits
So we were the Pop Kids
I loved you
