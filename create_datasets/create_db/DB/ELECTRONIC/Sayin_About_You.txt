After having listened to
So many rumours in Colorado
After having spoken to
So many strangers in Corcovado

It made me feel the midnight blue
Do you know what they are sayin' about you?
Do you know what they are sayin'?
Or do you really care?

After having heard the stories
Grow with each telling
In certain quarters
Noses growing,tongues are flowing

It's so compelling
It's crossing borders
But maybe none of it is true
Do you know what they are sayin' about you?
Do you know what they are sayin'?

Or do you really care?
After having listened to
So many rumors in Colorado
After having spoken with

So many strangers in Corcovado
It made me feel the midnight blue
Do you know what they are sayin' about you?
Do you know what they are sayin'?
Or do you really care
