When your eyes
Pause on the ball
That hangs on the third branch
From the star
You remember why it is dark
And why it gets light again

The earth like the hearts
Slopes in its seat
And like that it travels
Along an elliptical path
Drawn into the darkness

An unpolished pearl
In the sky black in palm of hand
Flickering sun flame

And then you remember
That you yourself
You are a light bearer, a light bearer
Receiving radiance from others
Flickering sun flame
Unpolished earth in the palm of hand
