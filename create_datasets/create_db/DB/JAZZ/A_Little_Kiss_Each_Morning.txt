We'll be so happy, we'll always sing
If we remember one little thing
A little kiss each morning
A little kiss each night

Who cares if hard luck may be ahead
An empty cupboard, a crust of bread
A little kiss each morning
A little kiss each night

Dreams may disappoint us
As they often do
Bring your tears to me, Dear
I'll bring mine to you

Though hair so golden may turn to gray
I'll call you "Sweetheart" and always say
A little kiss each morning
A little kiss each night
