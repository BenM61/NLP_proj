Oh tonight, shines down a guiding light
Showing a former life
When we felt so alive

In a sea of light swimming before my eyes
Hold on to what is right
Open your open mind

Oh no please don't let me go no please
Don't leave me here to grieve innocent times

In the beginning I felt we were living I felt so alive
Under beautiful skies

Oh tonight slip in and out of life
Yet feeling so alive
Lost in the sea of light

Oh no please don't let me go no please
Don't leave me here to grieve innocent times

In the beginning I felt we were living I felt so alive
Under beautiful skies

Oh no please don't let me go no please
Don't let me go no please Beautiful Skies

In the beginning I felt we were living I felt so alive
Under beautiful skies
