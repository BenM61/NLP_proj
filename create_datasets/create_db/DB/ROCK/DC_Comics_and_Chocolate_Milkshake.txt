Life is especially hard
When no one trusts you with a credit card
I love the taste of cereal
I have it for almost every meal
Five people to a tea bag?
My life never really got that bad
Not while we still had

DC comics and chocolate milkshake
Some things will always be great
DC comics and chocolate milkshake
Even though I'm 28
DC comics and chocolate milkshake
I guess I'm just developing late
DC comics and chocolate milkshake
I never got over that amazing taste

I've been accused of some things
I'm not sure what they've meant
Peter Pan syndrome, and arrested development
Now I've been working since I was 10
But the money's always gone by the weekend
Delivering post to serving beer
I've never had much of a career
So I made sure I was always near

Some things will always be great
DC comics and chocolate milkshake
Even though I'm 28
DC comics and chocolate milkshake
I guess I'm just developing late
DC comics and chocolate milkshake
I never got over that amazing taste

I'm in love with a girl in my comic shop
She's a girl who likes comics;
She probably gets that a lot

Some things will always be great

Even though I'm 28

Some things will always be great
Even though I'm 28
I guess I'm just developing late
I never got over that sweet, sweet taste
