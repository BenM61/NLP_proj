If I let the rhythm get to me then I don't know what I would be
Think I just might lose my mind
If I let the rhythm get to me, it will take all of me
I'll lose track of space and time

Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, fever pitch
Just like a shot running through my veins
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, flick the switch
And you'll ignite an eternal flame

If I let the rhythm get to me then I don't know what I would be
Think I just might lose my mind
And if I let the rhythm get to me, it will take all of me
So I can't let go this time

If I let the rhythm get to me
If I let the rhythm get to me

If I let the rhythm get to me then I don't know what I would be
Think I just might lose my mind
And when it takes over me, it starts emotionally
I lose myself in flashing light

Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, no escape
It seems to be everywhere I go
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, it's my fate
It's like you want to lose control

If I let the rhythm get to me
If I let the rhythm get to me

It's the sweetest sensation
That I've ever known
If he's a beast, I need saving
The feeling only grows
So I know what I need whenever I hear that beat
It's a whirlwind, it's so sublime
But if I let the rhythm get to me
I have no clue what I'll be
Baby, you'd think I'll lose my mind

If I let the rhythm get to me
If I let the rhythm get to me
