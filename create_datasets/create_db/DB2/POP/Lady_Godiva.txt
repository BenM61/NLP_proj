Seventeen
A beauty queen
She made a ride that caused a scene in the town

Her long blonde hair
Hanging down around her knees
All the cats who dig striptease
Praying for a little breeze

Her long blonde hair
Falling down across her arms
Hiding all the lady's charms

Lady Godiva

She found fame
And made her name
A Hollywood director came into town

And said to her (hey!),
How'd you like to be a star?
You're a girl who could go far
'specially dressed the way you are

She smiled at him
And gave her pretty head a shake
That was Lady G's mistake

Oh, Lady Godiva

He directs Certificate X
And people now are craning their necks 
To see her

'Cause she's a star
One that everybody knows
Finished with her striptease shows
Now she can't afford her clothes

Her long blonde hair
Lying on a barber's floor
Doesn't need it long any more

Lady Godiva
