She just got home from the doctor's
I just got home from the mill
She looked a little peaked, her eyes were kind-a streaked
I couldn't figure out what made her ill
She looked a little weepish, smiled kinda sheepish
The answer hit me like a hickory mall
I throwed my dinner bucket down
Yelled like my trailin' hound I was gonna be a daddy after all

Now the waitin'
Anticipatin'
Rock-a-bye
I'm gonna be a daddy now!

Well the weeks went by kinda sweetly, then all at once
I thought she'd lost her mind
She would rant, she would rave, for the things she would crave
Like ice cream and sauerkraut combined
She wanted watermelon, it was wintertime
Dill pickles set around the house in jars
My how she'd eat that stuff, she never seemed to get enough
And at 3am she'd want candy bars
Oh,

Now the waitin'
Anticipatin'
Rock-a-bye
I'm gonna be a daddy now!

Well at last the time was drawin' near, I began to walk and pace and sweat
The doctor said: Now son, I know this ain't no fun
But we ain't never lost a Daddy yet
I stood up and set down, I even though of leavin' town
The doctor and nurse came out all grins
They said: Buck up my boy you should shout with joy,
You're the Daddy of a pair of bouncin' twins!

No more waitin, anticipatin' rock-a-bye, I'm a Daddy now!
