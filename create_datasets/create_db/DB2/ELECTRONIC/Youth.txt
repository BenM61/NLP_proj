Youth has gone
I heard you say
It doesn't matter
Anyway

Don't hide the photos
Or turn off the lights
I'm quite sure we've both seen
Funnier sights

Youth
Sleep in a deep deep deep
Beauty is skin deep

Youth has gone
Though we're still young
It's hard I know to believe
That I was somebody's son

The memories
Of what you once were
The memories of what
We both were

Youth
Sleep in a deep deep deep
Beauty is skin deep

Youth has gone
Though don't think
I don't cry
We let ourselves slip

And now
I ask myself why
I'm on my own
And don't think I really mind

When after all
The years have been fairly kind
Youth
Sleep in a deep deep deep

Beauty is skin deep
Sleep in a deep deep deep
Beauty is skin deep
Youth... Youth... Sleep!
