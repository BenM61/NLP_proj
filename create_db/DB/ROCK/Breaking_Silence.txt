Come into my solitude
Though I weary be
Come into my tenderness
Dream along with me

Listen to the whispers sing
Listen to the singers shout
Come into my solitude
Me and my big mouth

Thoughts unspoken, thoughts unsaid
Lies of hearth and home
Children broken on the bed
And left to lie alone

Things you talk around
Scum you chock on down
Come into my solitude
Step on sacred ground

We were speaking
Of values and violence
Breaking silence

Fathers who are lovers
To the daughters that they own
Mothers who don't leave a child
In a single safety zone

People so unhinged
That death is much to kind
Come into my solitude
Step over that line
(Thought I was the only one)

Thought I was the only one
Thought I was the only
(Thought I was the only)
Thought I was the only, only one
(Thought I was the only)

We were speaking
Of values and violence
Breaking silence

Come into my solitude
Welcome to the wheel
Come into this wonderland
Of wounds that will not heal

Walls that do not speak
Steps that do not sound
Come into my solitude
Burn this building down
