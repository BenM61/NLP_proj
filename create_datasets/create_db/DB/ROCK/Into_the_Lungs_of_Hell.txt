Christ burned me with his eyes
But I'm still alive
Welcome to the lungs of hell
Frost or fire, whatever you desire
Collector of souls, captor of sin
I'm not alone, I suck every soul

Into the lungs of hell
Collector of souls, captor of sin
I'm not alone, I suck every soul
Into the lungs of hell
All you need is a graveyard of souls
And grievous sins untold

Into the lungs of hell
Hear the sound of the demon bells
All you need is a graveyard of souls
And grievous sins untold...
