(Let me in it when you wanna)

Go down, or you shoot me down
I get high when you hold me
And it's only a minute and I'm all about you
Let me in it when you wanna
Let me in it when you wanna
(You're the only one that makes me feel)
You're the only one that makes me feel this way
You're the only one that makes me feel, feel
You're the only one that makes me feel this way
You're the only one that makes me 
You're the only one that makes me 
(Wanna feel, wanna feel)
(Let me in it when you wanna)

I get high when you're heated up
Get a chill when you're leaving
And it's automatic I'm all about you
Let me in it when you wanna
Let me in it when you wanna
(You're the only one that makes me feel)
You're the only one that makes me feel this way
You're the only one that makes me feel, feel
You're the only one that makes me feel this way
You're the only one that makes me 
You're the only one that makes me 
(Wanna feel, wanna feel)

You're the only one that makes me feel this way
You're the only one that makes me feel, feel
You're the only one that makes me feel this way
You're the only one that makes me 
You're the only one that makes me 
You're the only one that makes me feel this way
You're the only one that makes me feel, feel
You're the only one that makes me feel this way
You're the only one that makes me feel
You're the only one that makes me 
(Wanna feel, wanna feel)
