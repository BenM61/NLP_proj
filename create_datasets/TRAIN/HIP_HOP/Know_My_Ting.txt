Incredible

Run out of rum, re-up the car 
You know my ting
She wants to laugh cos of the 'ha', ah
You know my ting
Dark skin or light, ain't got a type, ah

You know my ting
Fam, you know my ting, fam, you know my ting
Fam, you know my ting, fam, you know my ting
Fam, she already know my ting, she ready to go home and ting
Fam, you know my ting, fam, you know my ting

Rude boy
Got your baby in my new toy
I made her be National
I took Nat west before you Lloyd
My turn
I was in this queue before you joined
Eye this, night shift
She don't deserve no penthouse viewpoint

Don Gorgon, Don Dada
Dun all of them mans badder
Mr Lover Lover like Shabba
And all the peng tings in the manor
No skeletons in my wardrobe
Just bags worth of swagger
What the f*ck's that on your torso?
That ain't worth the hanger

Run out of rum, re up the car, ah
You know my ting
She wants to laugh cos of the 'ha', ah
You know my ting
Dark skin or light, ain't got a type, ah
You know my ting
We spend pounds, you make sounds, ah
You know my ting
Fam, you know my ting, fam, you know my ting
Fam, you know my ting, fam, you know my ting
Fam, she already know my ting, she ready to ho home and ting
Fam, you know my ting, fam, you know my ting

Bad man
Yours wife's postcode in my Sat-Nav
WiFi code in my iPhone
Leave the toilet seat up and smash that
So many condoms in the trash bag
Man's gonna think its a gang bang
Man's got a girl doing cartwheels, backflips, handstands

Don Gorgon, Don Dada
Dun all of them mans badder
