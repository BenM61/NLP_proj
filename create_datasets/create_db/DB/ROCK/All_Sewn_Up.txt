All sewn up
With bad tattoos
All bit up
Nothin' to lose
Well I've been a fool for oh so long

now the Mississippi mud cakes my boots
I'm afraid that I might drown if I don't move
From these waters that run so deep
From these southern ways and lazy heat
Now I'm stuck
Ain't got much to show
With a little luck
Just watch me go

I've got torn up knees and caloused fingertips
Broken vocal chords and busted lips
This goddamn guitar is never quite in tune
Id leave it behind if it weren't all I could do
Now I'm stuck
Ain't got much to show
With a little luck
Just watch me go
Hell I'm all sewn up with bad tattoos
Can't hide from the faded truth
Well it follows me wherever I might move
All sewn up with bad tattoos

well San Francisco sure sounds nice
And Brooklyn might suit me just fine
Well life down here just moves so slow it seems
Like a river barge pushin' upstream
Now I'm stuck
Ain't got much to show
With a little luck
Just watch me go
Now I'm all sewn up with bad tattoos
Can't hide from the faded truth
Well it follows me wherever I might move
I'm all sewn up with bad tattoos
