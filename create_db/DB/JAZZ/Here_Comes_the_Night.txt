Here comes the night, my cloak of blue,
Here comes the night with dreams of you.
Somewhere up there I'll see your face,
The breeze will be your warm embrace.

Here comes the night to thrill my heart,
My one delight while we're apart,
And now I'll seek that rendezvous,
Here comes the night, holding me tight for you.
