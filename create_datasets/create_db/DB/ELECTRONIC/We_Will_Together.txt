Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

I'll kiss your hair baby, my lonely o-one
Somewhere toni-ight, you and I will find a way-ay-ay
Under the shee-eets, doin' this precious
This precious way

Some sunny day

Don't you know you're my lonely one
Sunshowers on day-ays
You and I wash in the wa-a-a-aves
Under the shee-eets of these precious wa-aves

Swim, sing together-er, while others play-ay-ay
We will together, some sunny day-ay-ay

Swim, sing together-er, while others play-ay-ay
We will together-er (together), some sunny day-ay-ay

Swim, sing together-er (together), while others play-ay-ay
We will together-er (together), some sunny day-ay-ay...
