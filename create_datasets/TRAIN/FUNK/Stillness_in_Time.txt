There's a stillness in time
Which I cannot define
Does your heart bleed like mine
For a place we can go
Where the troubles of our time are far away
And I had all my life in front of me
Now my darkness days are trouble free
There's no place where I could rather be
Than this journey of discovery.

I found love in that way
And I'm never sad, and I'm always glad
Anything you give me today
I will be thankful for
People find it hard to be strong
Cos they don't know where they're coming from
There was nothing let to do but hang on
For a stillness in time.

If you find that something's going wrong
Look around at what you're running from
There are so many wondrous things for you to see
If this world is turning too fast for your head
Just remember how bad times can roll instead
You can wait a thousand years in line
For that stillness in time.
