Of all the stupid things I could have thought 
This was the worst 
I started to believe 
That I was born at seventeen 

And all the stupid things 
The letters and the broken verse 
Stayed hidden at the bottom of the drawer 
They'd always been 

And now I plough through piles 
Of bills, receipts and credit cards 
And tickets and the Daily News 
And sometimes I just . . .

want to go back to my home town 
Though I know it'll never be the same 
Back to my home town 
'Cause it's been so long 

And I'm wondering if it's still there 
We think we're pretty smart 
Us city slickers get around 
And when the going's rough 

We kill the pain and relocate 
We're never married 
Never faithful not to any town 
But we never leave the past behind 

We just accumulate 
So sometimes when the music stops 
I seem to hear a distant sound 
Of waves and seagulls

Football crowds and church bells 
And I . . .
want to go back to my home town 
Though I know it'll never be the same 

Back to my home town 
'Cause it's been so long 
And I'm wondering if it's still there 
Back to my home town 

Though I know it'll never be the same 
Back to my home town 
'Cause it's been so long 
And I'm wondering if it's still there
