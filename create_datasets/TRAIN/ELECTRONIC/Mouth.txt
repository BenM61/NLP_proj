You gave me this
You made me give
Your silver grin
Still sticking it in

You have soul machine
Soul machine

The longest kiss
Peeling furniture days
Drift madly to you
Pollute my heart drain

You have broken at me
Broken me
All your mental armor drags me down
Nothing hurts like your mouth mouth mouth

Your loaded smiles
Pretty just desserts
Wish it all for you
So much it never hurts

You have soul machine
Stolen me
All your mental armor drags me down
We can't breathe when you come around
All your mental armor drags me down
Nothing hurts like your mouth mouth mouth
Your mouth mouth mouth
Your mouth mouth mouth

We've been missing long before
Never found our way home
We've been missing long before
Where we'll find our way

You gave me this
Made me give
You have soul machine
Broken free
All your mental armor drags me down
We can't breathe when you come around
All your mental armor drags me down
Nothing hurts like your mouth mouth mouth
Your mouth mouth mouth
Your mouth mouth mouth
All your mental armor
All your mental armor
And your mouth
Mouth
