I put you in the fliest gear
Making sure you're tight
Perpetrating making you think
Everything's all right
Call you on my cell phone
Baby, even on my time
The crazy things I do for love
Bouncin' baby acting like
Money ain't a thing
Only if you promise girl that
You will try no game
Kiss me girl and I'll spend
Every dollar to my name
The crazy things I do for love
Movies, hanging out
Spending time
Anything my girl wants
Phone calls
I love you calls
Shopping malls
Nothing's ever too much
I know I can't afford it baby
But I'll do the best I can lady
'Cause you my everything
One day you'll wear my ring
I'll do it all for you baby

I put you in the fliest gear
Making sure you're tight
Perpetrating making you think
Everything's all right
Call you on my cell phone
Baby, even on my time
The crazy things I do for love
Bouncin' baby acting like
Money ain't a thing
Only if you promise girl that
You will try no game
Kiss me girl and I'll spend
Every dollar to my name
The crazy things I do for love

In the park
Having fun
That's what's up
My baby got to look good
Roses 'cause I care
And I'll be there
Cross my heart, I swear
I know I can't afford it baby
But I'll do the best I can lady
You're my everything
One day you'll wear my ring
I'll do it all for you baby

I put you in the fliest gear
Making sure you're tight
Perpetrating making you think
Everything's all right
Call you on my cell phone
Baby, even on my time
The crazy things I do for love
Bouncin' baby acting like
Money ain't a thing
Only if you promise girl that
You will try no game
Kiss me girl and I'll spend
Every dollar to my name
The crazy things I do for love

Girl I'm so open
And I'm hoping
That you notice
All the crazy things
I do for love

I put you in the fliest gear
Making sure you're tight
Perpetrating making you think
Everything's all right
Call you on my cell phone
