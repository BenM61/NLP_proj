I can see you're thinking baby
I've been thinking too
About the way we used to be
And how to star a new

Maybe I'm a hopeless dreamer
Maybe I've got it wrong
But I'm going where the grass is green
If you like to come along

Back when I was starting out
I always wanted more
But every time I got it
I still felt just like before

Fortune is a fickle friend
I'm tired of chasing fate
And when I look into your eyes
I know you feel the same

All these years of living large
Are starting to do a sin
I wont say it wasn't fun
But now it has to end

Life is moving oh so fast
I think we should take it slow
Rest our heads upon the grass
And listen to it grow

Going where the hills are green
And the cars are few and far
Days are full of splendor
And at night you can see the stars

Life's been moving oh so fast
I think we should take it slow
Rest our heads upon the grass
And listen to it grow
