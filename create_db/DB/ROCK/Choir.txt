There's a choir behind me
Egging me on
Placing their bets and hoping I'll do no wrong
I'll do no wrong
There's a guy inside me
Biding his time
Standing in line and waiting for me to fall
For me to fall
Self-preservation threatens us all
Health deterioration comes to us all
There's a fag beside me
Waiting to be lit
Trying to trick me
And make me forget I've quit
I forget I've quit
I take a risk everyday when I get up
Do I try harder?
Or continue to f*ck up
F*ck up
There's a bear in my bed
Wanting to be loved
Eyes like marbles
All he needs is a hug
My beginner's luck is wearing thin
I'll need to rely on skill if I'm going to win
I'm going to win
