Miles away
I'm walking in like someone else again
Miles away
I'm watching summer through an English rain

And I'm a new man when I walk away
It's crazy
Shaking the daze from my head again
I know I must be miles away

Miles away
Miles away
Miles away

Miles away
I reassemble on the morning train
I try to say
My voice just tumbles on a long delay

And there's a new man at the edge of me
It's crazy
Making new plans for the rest of me
I'm looking back from miles away

Miles away
Miles away
Miles away

All the same
We talk on telephones across the haze
Miles away
The planes go glinting on their vapour trails

And I'm a new man when I walk away
It's crazy
Turning my head to the shine again
I'm waking up from miles away

Miles away
Miles away
Miles away
