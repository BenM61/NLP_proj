A key in the door, a step on the floor,
A note on the table, and a meal in the micro
Upstairs I'm in bed, please make sure that you're fed
If you're taking a shower, you can borrow my bathrobe
And when I'm asleep I dream you move in next week
I crumple the note and save it to put inside

My shoe box (shoe box)
My shoe box of lies

It's under my bed, it's never been read
It's in with my school stuff and my mom never cleans there
From my first little fib, when I still wore a bib
To my latest attempt at pretending I'm someone
Who's not seventeen, and doesn't know what you mean
When talk turns to single malts, or stilton, or

My shoe box (shoe box)
My shoe box of lies
My shoe box (shoe box)
Shoe box of lies

Did somebody tell you
This is how it's supposed to be?
Or did you just find it
And you don't want any more from me?

Was it something I said, or was it something you read
That's making me think that I should never have come here
I can offer you lies, I can tell you goodbye,
I can tell you I'm sorry, but I can't tell the truth, dear
And what if I could? Would it do any good?
You'll still never get to see the contents of 

My shoe box (shoe box)
Shoe box of lies
My shoe box (shoe box)
My shoe box of lies

You're so nineteen-ninety
And it's nineteen-ninety-four
Leave this world behind me
'Cause you don't want me anymore
