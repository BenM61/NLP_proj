Last night I fell apart
Broke from my swollen heart
Born in a simple time
Raised with the simple mind

You may be a natural woman
You may be a natural woman
You may be a natural woman
You may be a natural woman

I may be worthless without you

(Woman, woman) Oh
I may be worthless without you
I'll never decide to replace you
Amen, the worst is behind us now
(Woman, woman)
(Woman)

You may be a natural woman
You may be a natural woman
You may be a natural woman
You may be a natural woman

Last night I fell apart
Choked on my drunken heart

I may be worthless without you
I'll never decide to replace you
Amen, the worst is behind us now
(Woman, woman) Oh
I may be worthless without you
I'll never decide to replace you
Amen, the worst is behind us now
(Woman, woman)

You may be a natural woman
You maybe a natural woman, you! (Ah) You (Ah)

Be my (Woman, won't you see me in the dark)

Who's that (Woman, woman)

I may be worthless without you
I'll never decide to replace you
Amen, the worst is behind us now
(Woman, woman) Oh
I may be worthless without you
I'll never decide to replace you
Amen, the worst is behind us now
(Woman, woman)
(Woman, woman)

You may be a natural woman
You may be a natural woman
You may be a natural woman
