Nobody knows what I go through
Indecisions made me passive
They say I want my cake and I want to eat it too
Less satisfied if I don't, consequences when I do
These lessons, they lead me on my way
but when company is tempting me, I'm turned around 
but I might want to go that way, 
don't want to go that way

Well, it's a catch 22
Damned if I don't, Damned if I do
Yes, it's a catch 22
Damned if I don't, Damned if I do

How many times does it take to learn just one thing, 
'cause I keep ending up here
And I'm not a scientist so I just keep on praying that I won't 
keep getting the same results each day
I said that I can't be with you
But when you turn away I pull back your hands to stay
(your hands to stay)
So many days turn to years
that brought us here
and we (shied) through time without too many tears
But we still made decisions creating divisions
So many contradictions, 
why didn't we listen?

Well, it's a catch 22(catch 22)
Damned if I don't, Damned if I do
Yes, it's a catch 22
Damned if I don't, Damned if I do
( I'm damned if I don't, I'm damned if I do)

'Cause when I see you looking at her
I can't stand it, my eyes can't conceive
You gave her the smile you gave to me
I love you selfishly
I can feel so strongly 
Oh, how you (throw) me
but still you know me
Oh, you know me

Yes, it's a catch 22,
Damned if I don't, Damned if I do 
(damned if I do) 
Yes, it's a catch 22, (catch 22)
Damned if I don't, Damned if I do
(I'm damned if I don't, I'm damned if I do)

To hell with all the promises we made,
the boundaries, the pain
I don't care who's wrong or right
Let's just ignore that tonight, I don't want to fight
Where you lead me I'll follow
I won't stress on tomorrow
'cause I miss you like the moon misses the sky,
the waves miss the sand,
the leaves miss the breeze flowin' by
So come to me easy,
'cause I know you can please me

But it's a catch 22....(repeat chorus til end)
