Well I've been thinking about you all day
Though my thoughts run wild, they won't run away
And I just can't stand it, if I don't think you're thinking of me

Oh last night you said love (Love)
Love is what you said
When you should of said take (Take)
Take is what you did
Did I make a mistake
Am I being misled
Oh and I don't want to think about you much too long
Now it's time you decided where you're coming from

With your four letter words
And your no letter goal
If it's true what I've heard
Then you don't love a soul
Get your four letter words
Get on over to me
Four letter words
Get on over to me
Three letter words

That it's going to be fine, if you just let go
Cause you can't play two-handed double-edged love games with me

Oh hell it's been hell (Hell)
Hell around here
When you know I can't tell (Tell)
Tell if you care
And I just can't live (Live)
Live knowing you're around there
Oh and I don't want to hear about it one more time
I got a four letter bet that says you're gonna be mine

With your four letter words
And your no letter goal
If it's true what I've heard
Then you don't love a soul
Get your four letter words
Get on over to me
Four letter words
Get on over to me
Three letter words
Oh and I don't want to hear about it one more time
I got a four letter bet that says you're gonna be mine
With your four letter words
And your no letter goal
If it's true what I've heard
Then you don't love a soul
Get your four letter words
Get on over to me-a
