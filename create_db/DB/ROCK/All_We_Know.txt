We tried so hard to understand
But we can't
We held the world out in our hands
And you ran away

It takes some time to let you go
And it shows
Cause all we know is falling
Remember how cause I know that we won't forget at all

Now we can follow you back home
But we won't
Is this what you had waited for
Just to be alone

It takes some time to let you go
And it shows
Cause all we know is falling it falls
Remember how cause I know that we won't forget at all

You never
You never said
This wasn't what you wanted
Was it
Was it

This isn't what you wanted
This isn't what you wanted
Cause all we know
Is falling it falls
Remember how cause I know that we won't
Forget it all
