She moves like a mystic
Like a priestess tall and pale
She lays down the mystery
All her secrets are unveiled

Wherever I look I see her there
Wherever I go you know she's there

And she takes possession she has control
Next to you I can touch the fire
And when the fever takes a hold
Next to you I can touch the fire

Her words fall in echos
Ringing bells like gypsy rhymes
She has the power
No believer can explain

Wherever I look I see her there
Wherever I go you know she's there

And she takes possession she has control
Next to you I can touch the fire
And when the fever takes a hold
Next to you I can touch the fire
I feel the heat pumping in my veins
Next to you I can touch the fire
I see myself going up in flames
Next to you I can touch the fire

Wherever I look I see her there
Wherever I go you know she's there

She takes possession
She has control
Next to you I can touch the fire
And when the fever takes a hold
Next to you I can touch the fire
I feel the heat pumping in my veins
Next to you I can touch the fire
I see myself going up in flames
Next to you I can touch the fire

She takes possession
Touch the fire
Touch the fire

I feel the heat pumping in my veins
Next to you I can touch the fire
I see myself going up in flames
Next to you I can touch the fire
