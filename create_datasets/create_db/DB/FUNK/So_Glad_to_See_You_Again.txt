 Boy, it's been such a long time since I seen you girl
 You haven't changed that much
 You look good
 The high school days and  college, oh
 
 I haven't seen you in a long, long time
 I haven't seen you since God knows when
 I haven't seen you, it's been so long
 It's so good to see you again
 
 Do you remember when you were mine
 The good times we had together
 Girl, it feels like old times
 It's so good to see you again
 
 Tell me what you've been doin', who you been seein'
 Where you've been going, by the way how do you feel
 Has your life been fulfilled,  are you reaching all your goals
 Can you stay or do you really have to go
 
 Girl, you sure took good care of yourself
 You're so fine, you're so good lookin'
 I can't compare you with no one else
 It's so good to see you again
 
 I heard you got married last year
 Are you in love, are you really happy?
 Well, it don't matter no how
 It's so good to see you [So good to see you]
 So good to see you, so good to see you again
 
 See you, see you, see you

 Tell me what you been doin', where you been goin'
 Who you been seein', by the way how do you feel
 Has your life been fulfilled,  are you reaching all your goals
 Can you stay or do you really, really have to go
 
 I hadn't seen you in a long long time
 Haven't seen you since God knows when
 I hadn't seen you, it's been so long
 It's so good to see you [So good to see you]
 So good to see you again

 What you been doin', where you been goin', who you been seein'
 Has your life been fulfilled, can we talk awhile
 'Cause it's been so long, I'm so glad to see you again
 It's been so long, I'm so glad to see you again
 Has your life been fulfilled
 Are you reachin' all your goals, are you reachin' all your goals
 Are you truly, truly, truly, truly, truly, truly, truly happy
 
 (By the way how do you feel)
 Hey, got married
 But it don't really matter (Are you happy)
 No, it don't
 It don't really matter
 No
 Because I'm so glad to see you
 Been such a long, long time
 You know
 You look so fine, you're so good lookin'
 
 Just like the time when you just liked standing on the corner, you know
 Some people go back to the 50's, 60's, 70's
 ???You used to always???
 ???It was always ???
 But you link on the corner, talk about things before you go to school
 And all them years, all them years I thought about you
