There's music in the streets
There's music everywhere
A little old soul beat
There's dancing everywhere
I would tell the whole world
Tell them if I could
To add a little song into each life
It's finger snappin good

Pardon me, but you could use it
We're goin to make a little music
You got soul now don't you lose it
We're goin to make a little music
Everything's going to be mellow
People just a singin occapella
People just a singin occapella

There's music in the street
There's muisc in the air
A little old soul beat
There's dancin everywhere
I would tell the whole world
Tell them if I could
To add a little song into each life
It's finger snappin good
