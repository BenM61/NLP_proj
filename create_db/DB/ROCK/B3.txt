I refuse to remain in regrets
To pander like a slave to your wants
No contrition from me will you get
No submission to dilettantes (No)

I've existed too long in secrets
I have lived like a man confined
Epicene and elaborate
Fatalistic and resigned (No)

Passionflower
Catherine wheel
Higher power
Help me start to heal

Now I vein in the scene of sunsets
And the rain washes clean my mind
Every one of my needs will be met
Every planet will be aligned

Passionflower
Catherine wheel
Higher power
Help me start to heal

Over power all my fear
Now to power
Guide me through the realm

I refuse to remain in regret
I refuse to be left behind (No)

Passionflower
Catherine wheel
Higher power
Help me start to heal
