You try to read me
You try to figure out
You try to breathe me
But you can't blow me out
You try to feel me, but I'm so out of touch
I won't be falling
You won't have to pick me up

Sorry if I sound confused
I don't feel the way you do

But I won't turn around
But I won't turn around

You think that I might back down but I won't
Think that I might have doubts but I don't
No insecurities
Won't you just let me, let me be
Think that you know me now, but you don't
Think that I-I can't stand on my own
Ain't my philosophy
Won't you just let me, let me be

Trust in my instincts
Trust that I know what's right
These are the reasons that keep you up at night (at night)

Tell me "Go slow", this is my flow
'Cause you don't know, know what I know
Let me tell you how it feels
Baby it's time that you see me for real

Sorry if I sound confused
I don't feel the way you do
But I won't turn around
But I won't turn around

You think that I might back down but I won't
Think that I might have doubts but I don't
No insecurities
Won't you just let me, let me be
Think that you know me now, but you don't
Think that I-I can't stand on my own
Ain't my philosophy
Won't you just let me, let me be

Trust that I know, this is my show
Letting you know, gotta go the way I go
Trust that I know, this is my show
Letting you know, gotta go the way I go

You think that I might back down but I won't
Think that I might have doubts but I don't
No insecurities
Won't you just let me, let me be
Think that you know me now, but you don't
Think that I-I can't stand on my own
Ain't my philosophy
Won't you just let me, let me be

You think that I might back down but I won't
Think that I might have doubts but I don't
No insecurities
Won't you just let me, let me be
Think that you know me now, but you don't
Think that I-I can't stand on my own
Ain't my philosophy
Won't you just let me, let me be
