Have you seen the girl of great regret,
Looking for the man she can't forget?
Misery in high-heeled shoes,
Holding a bouquet of blues.

Have you seen her go her lonely way,
Dressed in tattered dreams of good-bye grey?
Lost, with nothing more to lose,
She carries a bouquet of blues.

All she can hear is the echo of a voice saying "This will last".
All she can do is follow in the footsteps of the past.

Think about the girl of great regret, 
Think about the man she can't forget. 
Never let the man you choose,
Bring you a bouquet of blues.
