Anyway now, it don't seem right
He's in there and you're on the outside
Over Pine Ridge to Wounded Knee
Blood on the ground as far as you see
Crazy life

In the air I'm sensing a change of weather
In the end the path is clear

Does anyone remember here
Did you all think he'd just disappear
Crazy life
What have you done with Peltier
Who do you think you're taking away
Crazy life

In the air I'm sensing a change of weather
In the end the path is clear

Burying won't stop it breathing forever
Underground it takes to root, oh

Anyway, it don't seem right
He's in there and you're on the outside
What have you done with Peltier
Who do you think you're taking away
It's not over, it's not over
It's not over, over, over
It's not over, it's not over
Over, over, over
