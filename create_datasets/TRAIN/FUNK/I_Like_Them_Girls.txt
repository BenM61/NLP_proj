I get a call from my crew this weekend
Talkin' bout a party say it's gone be crackin'
Since I'm tryin' to push
I tell them push the new Benz

'Cause when it's over it's straight parkin' lot pimpin'
Once I find my keys to the ride
Hit the spot around eleven forty five
'Cause everybody knows that's when it gets hot
Tonight I'm gonna find a little shorty for a player to cop

I need a hot girl for me (girl for me)
Sexy little momma (mommy)
Knows how to turn me on
Freak me from the night 'til the early morn'
A girl that knows just what she wants (what she wants)
When she sees a baby girl don't front no
Hair fly nails done
Look if she got one
That's the kind I like

I like dem girls between the sheets
I like dem girls iced up like me
I like dem girls in the fly Gucci
Rollin' deep in the "6" Cartier on the Wrist
I like em' thick
Small waist with the big 'ol hips
I like dem girls in the top Bentley
That's the kind of girl I need

Out the corner of my eye spot a shorty
Ice so bright baby lightin' up the party
She got the Prada fittin' right on her body
36-24 How could I let it pass me

I approached her with the game on tight (game on tight)
This the type of flavor I like (flavor I like)
She said what's up with later tonight (later tonight)
I'm gonna do whatever feels right
To you

I need a hot girl for me (Baby)
A sexy little mommy (Sexy little mommy)
Knows how to turn me on
Freak me from the night 'til the early morn'
A girl that knows just what she wants (she wants)
When she sees a baby girl, front no
Hair fly, nails done
Look if she got one
That's the kind I like

I like dem girls between the sheets
I like dem girls iced up like me

Rollin' deep in the "6" Cartier on the Wrist
I like em' thick
Small waist with the big 'ol hips
I like dem girls in the drop Bentley
That's the kind of girl I need
