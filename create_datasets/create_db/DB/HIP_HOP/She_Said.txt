She said I love you boy
I love your soul
She said I love you baby oh oh oh oh oh

She said I love you more than words can say
She said I love you bayayayayby

So I said, what you saying girl it cant be right
How can you be in love with me
We only just met tonight
So she said boy I loved you from the start
When I first heard love goes down
Something started burning in my heart
I said stop this crazy talk
And leave right now and close the door
She said but I love you boy I love you so
She said I love you baby oh oh oh oh oh
She said I love you more than words can say
She said I love you bayayayayby (yes you did)

So now up in the courts
Pleading my case from the witness box
Telling the judge and the jury
With the same thing that I said to the cops
On the day that I got arrested
Im innocent, I protested
She just feels rejected
Had her heart broken by someone shes obsessed with
'Cause she likes the sound of my music
Which makes her a fan of my music
That's why love goes down makes her lose it
'Cause she can't separate the man from the music
And I'm saying all this in the stand
As my girl cries tears from the galleries
Got bigger than I ever could have planned
Like that song by the Zutons Valerie
So the jury don't look like their buying it
And it's making me nervous
Arms crossed screw faced like im trying it
Their eyes fixed on me like a murder's
They wanna lock me up
And throw away the key
They wanna send me down

Even though I told them she

She said I love you boy
I love your soul
She said I love you baby oh oh oh oh oh (yes you did)

She said I love you more than words can sing
She said I love you bayayayayby

So I said why the hell you gotta treat me this way
You don't know what love is
You wouldn't do this if you did
Oh no no no no
