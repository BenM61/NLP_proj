There was a time when I loved you
That was a time baby, you made blue
There's a time for everything baby
Now it's time to say we're through

Remember the time baby, you made me cry
And the times baby, you broke my heart
But there's a time for everything baby
Now it's time for us to part

They say that time, time brings 'bout a change
And I know baby, I know that's no lie
In time I will forget you baby
So it's time to say goodbye
