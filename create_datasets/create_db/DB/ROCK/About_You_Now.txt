There's a mountain between us
But there's one thing I'm sure of
That I know how I feel about you

Can we bring yesterday back around
'Cause I know how I feel about you now
I was dumb, I was wrong
I let you down
But I know how I feel about you now

All that it takes, one more chance
Don't let our last kiss be our last
Give me tonight, and I'll show you

I know everything changes,
I don't care where it takes us
'Cause I know how I feel about you

Can we bring yesterday back around
'Cause I know how I feel about you now
I was dumb, I was wrong
I let you down
But I know how I feel about you now

Not a day passed me by, not a day passed me by
When I don't think about you
And there's no moving on, 'cause I know you're the one
And I can't be without you

Can we bring yesterday back around
'Cause I know how I feel about you now
I was dumb, I was wrong
I let you down
But I know how I feel about you now

Can we bring yesterday back around
'Cause I know how I feel about you now
I was dumb, I was wrong
I let you down (I let you down)
But I know how I feel about you now

But I know how I feel about you now
Yeah I know how I feel about you now
