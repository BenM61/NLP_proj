Let me tell you a story about a girl I know

She is so beautiful
With flowers in her hair
Her perfume smells like summer air
And her lips are the sweetest like honey and milk
And her skin white like cocaine but soft as silk
And her hair is as black as a reservoir

At midnight and still and it takes me so far
So far that I don't believe that there is an end
But if there is I will climb out, dive in again

We picked daisies and I made a chain
Asleep in the grass, both feeling insane
And if this isn't love don't show me the truth
I said if this isn't love
I'm gonna need some

Tiny wild flowers all tied in your hair
Like stars in the sky just floating there
A constelation gorgeous and new
You called it The Lovers
I believed it was true

And all of a sudden you rose from our nest
No longer felt love
I felt sorrow instead
As you walked you combed out your hair
And all the flowers fell like birds through the air

We picked daisies and I made a chain
Asleep in the grass, both feeling insane
And if this isn't love don't show me the truth
I said if this isn't love
I'm gonna need some

Like stars in the sky
Falling to earth
The Lovers are dead
The Lovers are cursed

We picked daisies and I made a chain
Asleep in the grass, both feeling insane
And if this isn't love don't show me the truth
I said if this isn't love
I'm gonna need some
