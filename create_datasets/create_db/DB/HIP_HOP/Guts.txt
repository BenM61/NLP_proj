Give me your guts, deliver them up
It was half-past nothing and the river was blood
The city shrugged, we closed our eyes, stepped back into our huts
As if it meant nothing to us

Come on, give me your palm and a bucket of Khan
Hold me closer on the sofas sleeping under your arm
They say that slumber will harm
But I am under your charm
So keep it going never know when we'll be sober to start

Give me them thundering darks
Give me them hungers that've been coming apart so long
It's a wonder that we still want to dance
But here we are in the humbling dark
Throwing shapes while the hunters advance

Come on, give me your chance
Where the eyes might find
Opposition left her wishing she was mine all mine
And not first night until the eyes go blind
We're entwined

Oh, but in the morning they all leave us behind

Come on, give me your guts, man, deliver them up
You say you're searching for something but the sympathy's stuck
So come on, give me your guts, man, deliver them up
There's no villainy big enough that you can't kill it with love
Come on, give me your guts - deliver them up
You know you're looking above, but you're living for love
Come on, give me your guts, man deliver them up
Skimming the surface but it isn't enough
No, it isn't enough

Give me a smile let me kick it around
It was something I found in the road
The night's coming down
He gives like a toad
He's just looking for a princess to love him
But all the princesses think he's just disgusting
You can beat him up but can't budge him
I was in Budgens, picking up a can with my cousin
And I saw him bent double by the dustbins
Retching up a puddle of guts, people
Wanted to help but they couldn't bear touch him
The fat prince rolled over, too much
Look, you can kick him down but can't crush him
You can take him home but can't trust him
His heart is a book, his armour is crooked
His arms are the hooks in the mouth of a mermaid he's been harvesting
Shook dry by barbarous lips
He sees the picture but he's hardly a part of it
He's starting to slip

Trust, for him it's harder than it looks
They're holding those riddles
Up in the middle
While others hide in their books
Every cranny every nook
Backing up what they could
Storming alleys in their valleys happy with what they took
From what they're given
Locks their living
Holding dogs they're sniffing
Floorboards lifting up
In every flat they're slotting all the difficult decisions
He's used to it
Bruises for proof of it
Fuses shot he didn't use until his uses
Until he's blot where Gruesomes live
Truth of it
Abusive kid
Simply wanted shoes to fit
His hands would understand there's a grand if you move this shit
Sniffing white powder
Burning through the light hours
Getting light, losers getting tight
Couldn't lose his grip
Soon he did, slipped and slept where the kid was kept
Took the deepest breath of his ex, said

"I'm deep in debt"

Steep regret, cos he died like his brother
When all he wanted to do was provide for his mother

So, give me your guts, man, deliver them up
There's more to the world than the things you can touch
Give me your guts, man, deliver them up
Funny feeling in your lungs
But the sympathy's strung
So come on, give me your guts, man, deliver them up
Now I'm trying to go the distance but I keep getting stuck
Man, give me your guts, come, deliver them up
You sit, sipping the wisdom till you're feeling the calm

Give me a reason, the reason is long gone
Even the feeling I want one is wrong
And every evening when I feel it come on
I start to laugh, start singing the song

Singing the song, look give me a reason
The reason is long gone
And even the feeling that I want one is wrong
And every evening when I feel it come on
I start to laugh, start singing the song, give me your guts
Come on deliver (come on deliver) them up
Give me your guts, man, deliver them up
