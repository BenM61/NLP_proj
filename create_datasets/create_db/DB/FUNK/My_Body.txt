Who do you think I am I don't play these
Games
Not goin' out like that let me explain
Tryin' to save myself don't pressure me
My spirit leads me to celibacy
I have to just be real and I know it's fair
I want to please my God and I don't care
You can just leave now but if you stay
There's gonna be no other way

If this is love then you can take it
If this is not then don't ya fake it
My body is the Lord's temple
Don't mess with me God's property
It ain't that bad if you try to see
His perfect will is all that I need
My body is the Lord's temple
Don't mess with me God's property

What part of no don't you seem to 
Understand
I just can't move that fast it's not His plan
I'm not ashamed to do what I know is right
His yoke is easy and His burden's light
Momma sat me down and she would say
Just trust in the Lord and Him only
No disrespect but I can't be with you
And try to serve the Lord in honesty too

My body is God's body 
No it ain't your property
Jesus died on Calvary
Just to save someone like me
Who am I to betray His love
Tell ya what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna pray fo you
