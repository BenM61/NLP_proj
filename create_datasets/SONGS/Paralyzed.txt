This feels like another dream
Trapped underneath my own routines
I tried to lift it off of me
I give up, I give up
I just sit and bleed

I'm paralyzed, I'm paralyzed
Stuck in the middle
And I'm paralyzed

Arms and legs in between
Caught inside a stupid dream
Look for her, but cannot see
I give up, I give up
There's no time to believe

I'm paralyzed, I'm paralyzed
Stuck in the middle
And I'm paralyzed
I'm paralyzed, I'm paralyzed
The only way to cope
Is to realize

This feels like another dream
Everyone grabbed ahold of me
Pulled from every side of me
I give up, I give up
There's nothing left of me

Arms and legs inbetween
Caught inside a stupid dream
Look for her, but cannot see
I give up, I give up
There's no time to believe

I'm paralyzed. I'm paralyzed
Stuck in the middle
And I'm paralyzed
I'm paralyzed. I'm paralyzed
The only way to cope
Is to realize

I'm paralyzed...
I'm paralyzed...

I'm paralyzed, I'm paralyzed
Stuck in the middle
And I'm paralyzed
I'm paralyzed, I'm paralyzed
The only way to cope
Is to realize

I'm paralyzed
Stuck in the middle and I'm paralyzed
I'm paralyzed
The only way to cope is to realize
