See that sun in the morning,
Peeking over the hill?
I'll bet you're sure it always has and sure it always will.
That's how I feel about someone,
How somebody feels about me.
We're sure we love each other
That's the way we'll always be.

Oh, we ain't got a barrel of money,
Maybe we're ragged and funny
But we'll travel along
Singing a song
Side by side.

Don't know what's comin' tomorrow
Maybe it's trouble and sorrow
But we'll travel the road
Sharing our load
Side by side.

Through all kinds of weather
What if the sky should fall?
Just as long as we're together,
It doesn't matter at all.
When they've all had their quarrels and parted

We'll be the same as we started
Just a-traveling along
Singing a song
Side by side.

We're all hunting for something
Something we don't know what
'Cause none of us are satisfied with things we know we've got.
We all forget about moonlight,
As soon as we've given our vow
But we'd all be so happy if we'd start and sing right now:

Oh, we ain't got a barrel of money,
Maybe we're ragged and funny
But we'll travel along
Singing a song
Side by side.

Don't know what's comin' tomorrow
Maybe it's trouble and sorrow
But we'll travel the road
Sharing our load
Side by side.
