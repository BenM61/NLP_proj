I'm your God I've just arrived
A beatbox Jesus dancing jive
Venus Mars and Saturn five
A billion TV stars alive

Champagne champagne and model girls
Credit cards let's buy the world
Visa club and Gold Am X
Caroline and Princess Steph

Sex fun success
Sex fun success
Luxury - give it me
Nothing more and nothing less
Than success

Dallas dollars limousines
Debutantes and dynasty
Here's a dream that money buys
Late to bed and late to rise

Luxury - give it me
- Get it, I got it
Fantasy and ecstasy
- Get it, I got it
Grab a piece of that golden fleece
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
On the beach with the nouveau riche
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
On the beach with a Rolls Royce each
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Yeah-Yeah-Yeah
Success

Roll X Rolls Royce Romeo
Say hello to Savile Row
Take a cheque from Coutts & Co.
Limousines - all systems go
