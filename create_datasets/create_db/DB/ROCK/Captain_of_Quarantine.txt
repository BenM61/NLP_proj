I'm rushing a lamppost fevers got me
I'm thawing my best jokes but I sat alone
With the captain of the quarantine
I chewed my way through my boat
I paddled with feathers I fell snug in a fish snare
My faulty fins fell impaired
You boasted about your coins
I seared back your wooden charm
You shelved my affections
