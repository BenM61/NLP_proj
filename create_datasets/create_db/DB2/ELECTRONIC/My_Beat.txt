As we dance to a beat that seems out of time
To the one you feel in the metronome of your mind
Does it offend you that our rhythm looks strange
Or causes your thinking to be re-arranged?
Could it be that you would understand this beat to which we dance
More clearly had you been given a chance?
So as you struggle to find the feel with your feet
Ask yourself, can you dance to my beat?

Watch us get down to this groove with an Afro-funk feel
While we get high to a rhythm with spiritual appeal
Expressions of freedom from the descendants of slaves
God gives us the strength for new horizons we must brave
First bondage, then mental, now financially oppressed
With this beat we dance, we know we've passed the test
So as you struggle to catch the rhythm with your feet
Ask yourself, can you dance to my beat?

The rhythm, the rhythm, the rhythm is our power section
The freedom we feel in our soul
We dance to learn those lessons
As our story continues to unfold
Our beat, our words our melodies, our gifts
From the givers of those gifts
We're merely the terminals to which they have passed
So as you struggle to catch the rhythm with your feet
Ask yourself, can you really dance to my beat?

As we dance to a beat that seems out of time
To the one you feel in the metronome of your mind
Does it offend you that our rhythm looks strange
Or causes your thinking to be re-arranged?
Could it be that you would understand this beat to which we dance
More clearly had you been given the chance?
So as you struggle to find the feel with your feet
Ask yourself, can you really, really dance to my beat?
