Here comes the cool air, the light chill of the fall
Blowing from either direction
Blowing across the yard it's crisp and it's cool
Dogs like it, as they sit around in the sun
And stubbornly I remain under a tree
The wind gusts up stronger from time to time
We're supposed to grow cold as the day wears on
I'm'a looking for the future, today, today, today, today

And at the same time I am dreading the outcome of our actions
Fall makes me feel a little sad sometimes
Whip out the sweater and the second layer and it's time for a change
And surely it's the way,
Oh boy, oh shit!
Let's record it

A rednecks safe from a bitchy English professor
He seemed unconcerned with my purity of expression
And I can see his point, which is all well and good

Sometimes I'm not sure if I can see my...

Shake this time when it doesn't really mind
You do just fine and you won't next time
If you want it [Repeat x4]

Back to the weather, I must admit it looked pretty nice
Why are my legs shaking
Why are there still mosquitoes
Shouldn't they be in bed and dead by now

I guess I should give it, give it a little more time
I guess I should give it, give it a little more time

I guess I should give it, give it a little more time
I guess I should give it, give it a little more time

Give it, give it, a little more time

I guess I should give it, give it a little more time
Give it, give it, a little more time
[Repeat]
