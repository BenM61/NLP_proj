Once I was young 
Once I was smart 
Now I'm living on the edge of my nerves 
The things we said weren't quite so tough 
When we were you 

Well I'm burning, 
I'm burning buildings 
I'm building this time 

Burn 
For the art of parties 
Burn 
Under heavy weather 
The art of parties 
I'm burning, burning 

I'm living 
I'm living my life 
I'm living this time 

Burn 
For the art of parties 
Burn 
I'm burning, burning 

(The wind blew through my hair) 
Once I was young 
(I'd shelter from the sun) 
Once I was smart 
(We lived on the strength of our nerves) 
When we were you 

Well I'm building, 
I'm burning buildings 
I'm burning 

Burn 
For the art of parties 
Burn 
Under heavy weather 
Burn 
For the art of parties 
I'm burning, burning
