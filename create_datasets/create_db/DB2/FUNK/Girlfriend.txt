Losing it to waterfalls
Rip and tidy years of gold
Buried under rivers all the doubt I didn't notice
Cause maybe we learned for the magical
The carpet that belonged to those
The beautiful and mystical illusion
Not the broken

Feels like pretty doesn't know me
Only shows up when I'm lonely
Through the tears of imperfection
The mirror knows
Could you like someone that's hoping that
They crawl out of their own skin for a time?

If I was your girlfriend, could you love for two?
If I was your girlfriend, could you pull me through?
To make us fly
To make us fly

Don't be scared to shed a little broken
Oh baby, yeah
Your masculine's an armour to be opened
So that the day, the day, you know
When I'm your lady
You'll know how beautiful and mystical you are

If I was your girlfriend, could you love for two?
If I was your girlfriend, could you pull me through?
To make us fly
To make us fly

If I was your girlfriend, could you love for two?
If I was your girlfriend, could you pull me through?
To make us fly (to make us fly)
To make us fly (to make us fly)
To make us fly
