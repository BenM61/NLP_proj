We're in pursuit of happiness
Order of the day
And we're on, on a mission to make it true
We do it most every day

Step back and look where you are
Move away from the grey clouds passin' by
Keep strong 
And it won't be long until there's better times

And we're feelin' all right
We're driftin' on by
And we're feelin' all right
We're driftin' on by

We're all needin' much the same
In order, order to live
I know, no one said it wasn't hard
To get back what you give

And we're feelin' all right
We're driftin' on by
And we're feelin' all right
We're driftin' on by

(When I wonder, when I wonder)

Don't look back
Wave goodbye
Walk away from the dark shadows in the sky
Keep strong 
And it won't be long until there's better times

And we're feelin' all right
We're driftin' on by
And we're feelin' all right
We're driftin' on by

And we're feelin' all right
We're driftin' on by
And we're feelin' all right
We're driftin' on by
