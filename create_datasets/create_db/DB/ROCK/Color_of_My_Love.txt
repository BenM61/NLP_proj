Her hair was the colour of the sun
Was the colour of her eyes
Was the colour of my own true love
Her hair was the colour of the sun
Was the colour of her eyes
Was the colour of my only love

Love maker make me a love-song to sing
I'm in the right, she is wrong and she knows
He is in love and it shows
I want her love but she won't let me in
When I see her I think who's fooling who
She loves you too

Her hair was the colour of the sun
Was the colour of her eyes
Was the colour of my own true love
Her hair was the colour of the sun
Was the colour of her eyes
Was the colour of my only love

Maybe I'm wrong but I know I won't give in
I'll play her game and I hope she won't lose
You'll be the one that she'll choose - aha
Love maker make me a love-song to sing
I wait for her and I know she'll be there
She knows you care - I know she cares

Her hair was the colour of the sun
Was the colour of her eyes
Was the colour of my own true love
Her hair was the colour of the sun
Was the colour of her eyes
Was the colour of my only love

I love her
Her hair was the colour of the sun ....
