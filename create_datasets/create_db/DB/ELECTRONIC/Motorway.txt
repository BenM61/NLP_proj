Foreign names, neon lights
Changing lanes in my mind
Passing towns we don't know
Heading for the unknown
All our friends left behind
They're not even on my mind
They have lives, they have plans
They could never understand

Meet me on the motorway
Together we can make our great escape
Meet me on the motorway
Maybe we can find our perfect place
We can drive away
We can drive away
Meet me on the motorway
It's just me and you
It's just me and you

Getting late, coffee's cold
Heavy eyes, on the road
We won't stop, no we won't break
Shadows hide, overtake
The small town we left behind
We won't drown, we won't hide
A new life, a new plan
They would never understand

Meet me on the motorway
Together we can make our great escape
Meet me on the motorway
Maybe we can find our perfect place
We can drive away
We can drive away
Meet me on the motorway
It's just me and you
It's just me and you

We won't look back, so don't look back 
We won't look back, so don't look back 
We won't look back, so don't look back 
We won't look back, so don't look back 
We won't look back, so don't look back 
We won't look back, so don't look back 
We won't look back

Meet me on the motorway
Together we can make our great escape
Meet me on the motorway
Maybe we can find our perfect place
We can drive away
We can drive away
Meet me on the motorway
It's just me and you
It's just me and you
