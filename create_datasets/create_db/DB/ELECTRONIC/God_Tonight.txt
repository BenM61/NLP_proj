When you look at me so honestly
And I can't tell just what you see
Can I make you feel good
If I make you feel bad
Maybe you're the best dream
That I ever had

Put your had on your heart
When you tell me a lie
Put your lipstick on then put
Your lips on mine
You know I'm not perfect
And you know I'm not blind
But wouldn't it be good
If I was God tonight

If I could be God tonight
If I could be God
If I could be God tonight
What are you thinking of

Put your had on your heart
When you tell me a lie
Put your lipstick on then put
Your lips on mine
You know I'm not perfect
And you know I'm not blind
But wouldn't it be good
If I was God tonight

If I could be God tonight
With heaven in my hands
If I could be God tonight
All is calm in the promised land
If I could be God tonight
I'd lay my hands on you
If I could be God tonight
If I could be God
We need a miracle

If I could be God tonight
With heaven in my hands
If I could be God tonight
I'd lay my hands on you

To hell with money
To hell with guns
To hell with poverty
Death and drugs
To hell with hell
To hell with hate
To hell with fear
To hell with Aids
