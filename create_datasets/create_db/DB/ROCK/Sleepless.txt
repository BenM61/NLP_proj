Take your coat and shoes off 
Come and sit beside me 
We could talk for hours 
Or we could just do nothing 

Four billion people surround us 
So many souls lose their way 
All that we have is each other 
And that's all I've ever wanted 
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't you think it's funny 
Tell me what the point is 
We could die tomorrow 
Might as well enjoy this 

Four billion people surround us 
So many souls lose their way 
All that we have is each other 
And that's all I've ever wanted 
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Give me all your disappointments 
I'll give you my secrets 
We could lay our heads down 
Or be forever sleepless 

Four billion people surround us 
So many souls lose their way 
All that we have is each other 
And that's all I've ever wanted 
Yeah, yeah, yeah
