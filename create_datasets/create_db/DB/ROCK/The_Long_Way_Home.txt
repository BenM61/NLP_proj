Another night sleeping away from home
Is this shit real when will I see you again
I've seen the world with my friends and no one else
So many new faces, new places every night
Another city gone, another city shines at dawn

Even when we come across these broken roads
Life dead ends, I hope that your prepared for what's coming next

Another night we drive down this endless road
Another city and town, time flies when your growing old
Living life living a dream
I'll follow this road into forever until it takes my life

It seems I have taken the long way home
Boiling from, from the lights above, some things change
Time will fly and some friends will fade away
My family and friends, I'm with you till the end

It seems I have taken the long way home
Boiling from, from the lights above
I took the long way home so I could see the world
My family and friends, I'm with you till the end
I've taken the long way home
I've taken the long way home
I've taken the long way home
I've taken the long way home...

I've taken the long way, I've taken the long way home
I've taken the long way, I've taken the long way home

I'm with you till the end!
I'm with you till the end!
I'm with you till the end!

I've taken the long way
(Long way home!)
I've taken the long way home
(Long way home!)
I've taken the long way
(Long way home!)
I've taken the long way home
(Long way home!)
I've taken the long way...
(Long way home!)
I've taken the long way home
(Long way home!)
I've taken the long way
(Long way home!)
I've taken the long way home
(Long way home!)
I've taken the long way
(Long way home!)
I've taken the long way home
(Long way home!)
