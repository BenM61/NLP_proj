Well there's a little juke joint on the outside of town
Where the cats pick 'em up and lay 'em down
You get your gal, I'll get mine
And we'll get together and we'll have a good time.

We'll dance a little bit to the bop, to the bop
Dance a little bit to the bop
Well dance a little bit to the bop
Well now dance to the rock 'n' roll.

Yeah now, dance, dance, dance
Well, dance, dance, dance
Yeah now, dance, dance, dance
Well, dance, dance, dance
Well now dance, well dance to the rock 'n' roll. (Now got it, git it)

Well the cats come rockin' in two by two
Some come single like me and you
Dancin' to the bop is their delight
Well when thet get right, they'll dance all night.

They'll dance a little bit to the bop, to the bop
Dance a little bit to the bop
Dance a little bit to the bop
Well now dance to the rock 'n' roll.

Yeah now, dance, dance, dance
Well, dance, dance, dance
Yeah now, dance, dance, dance
Well, dance, dance, dance
Well now dance, well dance to the rock 'n' roll.
(Yeah, now rock it)

Yeah...We'll dance a little bit to the bop, to the bop
Dance a little bit to the bop
Dance a little bit to the bop
Well now dance to the rock 'n' roll.

Yeah now, dance, dance, dance
Well, dance, dance, dance
Now, dance, dance, dance
Well, dance, dance, dance
Well now dance, well now dance to the rock 'n' roll.
