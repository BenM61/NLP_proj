My pet, how I love her
My pet, speaking of her
Say, I bet, there's nobody like my pet!

Why pet with another?
My pet, pets no other
And I pet, with nobody but my pet!

Do-do-do, sweet and kind
Oh-doh-doh, perfect gem
Oh, she got "it"
Do-do-do-do-do, she's got them!

My pet told me truly
I'm set, absolutely
So I pet, with nobody but my pet!
