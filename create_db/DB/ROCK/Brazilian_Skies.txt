Shining like diamonds
Out on the open sea
The endless sea
Didn't I tell you
That I was wild and free
Journey with me
And I'll tell you what I see
A lonely man who lost his way
From the point of love I say
[Chorus:]
Didn't I tell you
Under Brazilian skies Always together
Love will remain in our eyes
This feeling
Will always stay with me
This romance can never be
High on the mountain
Breathing the air so sweet
So complete
You were so gentle
Loving was so carefree
Stand here with me
As I look towards the sea
A change of play we must obey
From the point of love I say
[Chorus]
I am at peace
When I hold you close to me
The lonely man has found his way
From the point of love I say
[Chorus]
