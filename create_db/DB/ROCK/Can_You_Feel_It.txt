When I'm on my own, I can be who I want to
There's another world on my bedroom walls
Can I get there someday
Can I get there someday

It could be yours, the world we see
The future's ours, stand close to me
Here we are, our dreams in sight
We'll come together
Can you feel it tonight?
Can you feel it tonight?

So I ran for days
And now I found my way
And as the streets race past
I just won't look back
Can I make it someday
Can I make it someday

It could be yours, the world we see
The future's ours, stand close to me
Here we are, our dreams in sight
We'll come together
Can you feel it tonight?

It could be yours, the world we see
The future's ours, stand close to me
Here we are, our dreams in sight
We'll come together
Can you feel it tonight?
Can you feel it tonight?
Can you feel it tonight?
