Somewhere in the night
There must be someone for me
Somewhere in the night
Who knows, where somewhere may be

Across the way
Or maybe, way beyond the distant star
How I wish, I knew
Just where and who you are

Somewhere in a dream
I find her here by my side
Then when I awake
My dream drifts out with the tide

My lonely heart keeps saying to me
"No, this doesn't seem right
There must be someone
Somewhere in the night"

Somewhere in a dream
I find her here by my side
Then when I awake
My dream drifts out with the tide

My lonely heart keeps saying to me
"No, this doesn't seem right
There must be someone
Somewhere in the night"
