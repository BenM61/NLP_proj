Caught in My Shadow
Yeah, I'm Caught in My Shadow

These streets used to look pretty
This town used to look like a city
These people used to talk to me

But now I'm Caught in My Shadow
Oh, Yeah, I'm Caught in My Shadow

Offer me the bait and I'd take it
Offer me the cake and I'd bake it
Usually I'd try to fake it
But these days I'd rather face it

Caught in My Shadow
Oh, Yeah, I'm Caught in My Shadow

If it's not enough I gave my blood
My sweat, my tears, and all I said I would

Oh

Oh, Yeah, I'm Caught in My Shadow
Yeah, I'm Caught in My Shadow
I'm Caught in My Shadow
Just leaves me behind
I'm Caught in My Shadow
Just leading the blind
