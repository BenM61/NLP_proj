When you're tired
The world on your shoulders
And fear in your mind
When it's washed out

And comfort's an old friend
That's too hard to find
I'll be yours
I will be yours

I'll be yours
I will be yours
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

When you're silent
The waiting has worn and you are alone
When you're cryin'
For someone to hold you

A shoulder to lean on
I'll be yours
I will be yours
I will be yours

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Woah oh, woah oh
When you're tired

The world on your shoulders
The fear in your mind
When it's washed out
And comfort's an old friend

That's too hard to find
I'll be yours
