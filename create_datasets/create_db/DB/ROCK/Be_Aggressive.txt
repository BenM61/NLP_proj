I started this
It's all for me what's yours is mine and mine is mine
That's plain to see
So give it up
I've got to have
I swallow, I swallow, I swallow, I swallow

Be aggressive, BE-E aggressive
BE-E-A-G-G-A-R-E-E-S-S-I-V-E

Be aggressive, BE-E aggressive
BE-E-A-G-G-A-R-E-E-S-S-I-V-E

What someone else
Would leave behind and spit it out, let go to waste I claim as mine
You're my flavour of the week
I swallow, I swallow, I swallow, I swallow

Be aggressive, BE-E aggressive
BE-E-A-G-G-A-R-E-E-S-S-I-V-E

Be aggressive, BE-E aggressive
BE-E-A-G-G-A-R-E-E-S-S-I-V-E

I swallow
I swallow

Aggressive

Tall and reckless 
Ugly seed reach down my throat you filthy bird that's all I need
The empty pit I've got to feed to prove I'm fit
A healthy man I've got to be
Malnutrition, my submission
You're the master and I take it on my knees
Ejaculation, tribulation
I swallow, I swallow, I swallow, I swallow

Be aggressive, BE-E aggressive
BE-E-A-G-G-A-R-E-E-S-S-I-V-E

Be aggressive, BE-E aggressive
BE-E-A-G-G-A-R-E-E-S-S-I-V-E

Go, fight, go, fight, go, fight, go, fight, win
