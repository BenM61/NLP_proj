I sigh ev'ry Monday thinkin' over Sunday
That one day when I'm with you
It seems that I sigh every Tuesday and I cry all day Wednesday
Oh, my, how I long for you

And then comes Thursday
Gee, it's long and never goes by
Friday makes me feel like I'm gonna die

But after payday is my fun day, 'cuz I fall all day Sunday
That one day when I'm with you

And then comes Thursday
Gee, it's long and never goes by
Friday makes me feel like I'm gonna die

But after payday is my fun day, 'cuz I get a groove on Sunday
That one day when I'm with you
