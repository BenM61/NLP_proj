Cars, clothes, girls and games
Through the years a lot of things changed
We shared the love like a melody
My sweetest moments are in your ear with me

Give me all of me
Giving you all of me too
Trusting me, trusting you
In my life

Every moment is so sweet
When you're laying next to me
Our hearts beating as one
Nothing we can't overcome

Every time I look at you
Your smile lets me know you feel me too
Anything you wanna be
I can do it because you're right here next to me

Give me all of me
Giving you all of me too
Trusting me
In my life

Every moment is so sweet
When you're laying next to me
Our hearts beating as one
Nothing we can't overcome

The sun, the moon, the stars
It can't compare to you and me
'Cause you are my everything
And I can't explain
(And I can't complain)
You never out of range
The wind, the rain, the sea
It just can't move like you and me baby
So cold when you feel the breeze
When you're laying next to me baby
Chills come constantly

Every moment is so sweet
When you're laying next to me
Our hearts beating as one
Nothing we can't overcome

I'm lying here, waiting for you
Girl you can get it any time you want it

I'm lying here, waiting for you
Girl you can get it any time you want it

I'm lying here, waiting for you
Girl you can get it any time you want it

I'm lying here, waiting for you
Girl you can get it any time you want it
