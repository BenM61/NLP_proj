I wanna take you home, to my place
Share my dreams and my fantasies, I can't wait
I wanna show you things, that you ain't never seen before
Girl I keep crying, crying out for more.

Talk to me, talk to me, am I doing this right.
Talk to me, talk to me, I am feelin' all right
I've been waiting for this my whole life, and here you are tonight
I've been waiting for this my whole life, and I can see it in your eyes
Are you ready to stay the whole night? To see the morning lights

I been waiting, and waiting, and waiting, my whole life.



So now, here we are, turn the lights down low

Oh we can go fast, or should I go slow?

I wanna kiss your lips, is that ok?

I'm that guy, I'm that guy baby, you'll be callin' out my name, sing it to me now.

Talk to me, talk to me, am I doing this right.
Talk to me, talk to me, I am feelin' all right, (sing it)
I've been waiting for this my whole life, and here you are tonight (here you are tonight)
I've been waiting for this my whole life, and I can see it in your eyes
Are you ready to stay the whole night? To see the morning lights

I been waiting, and waiting, and waiting, my whole life.

I wanna cater to you
No, nothing I wouldn't do
I tried to find words to say, I've never felt love in this way, this way

I've been waiting for this my whole life, and here you are tonight (here you are tonight)
I've been waiting for this my whole life and I can see it in your eyes
Are you ready to stay the whole night? To see the morning lights 
I been waiting, and waiting, and waiting

My whole life.
