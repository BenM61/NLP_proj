You give me love
I've never had
You make me feel good
When I'm feelin' bad
Come on and comfort me
Oh baby
You know the way I showed you how
To love me right
So comfort me
Tonight

Oh I make ya weezy
Take your time
You know I demand it
Love me till I can't stand
Come on and comfort me
You know the way I showed you how
To love me right
So comfort me
Tonight

Just one touch
That will be enough
You should know
I'm falling
It's love
So come on and comfort me
You know the way
I showed you how
To love me right
So come with me tonight
Come on and comfort me
Baby
You know the way
Baby
Come on and comfort me
Baby, comfort me tonight, baby
