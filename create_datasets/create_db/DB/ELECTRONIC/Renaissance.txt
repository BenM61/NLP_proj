I'm coming home
I'm coming home to your house
I'm coming home to your house
I'm coming home to your house
I'm coming home to your house
Boy, there's so many things to give
I've been aware of your charms for so long
And there's nothing that you can do
To stop me from coming around, 'round
To your house
To your house
To your house
To your house

I'm coming home
I'm coming home to your house
I'm coming home to your house
I'll be your queen, upon a throne in your house
I'm coming home
I'm coming home to your house

You can build it from bricks and stone
But there's still no point in being alone
So unlock your door; I'm coming through
'Cause this heart's got a message for you

I'm coming home
I'm coming home to your house
To your house
To your house
To your house

I'm coming home
I'm coming home to your house
I'm coming home to your house
I'll be your queen, upon a throne in your house
I'm coming home
I'm coming home to your house

By land or sea, I'm coming home to your house
Come fly with me 
I'm comin' home to your house
I'll be your queen, upon a throne in your house
I'll make you scream aloud with joy in your house
I'll bring you gifts, cash money too, to your house
I'll bring it all on home to you, to your house
There'll be no black, there'll be no white in your house
There'll be no day, there'll be no night

Have mercy, mercy, mercy
Have mercy, mercy, mercy
Have mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy
Mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy
'Cause you... 
Mercy on me
Mercy on me
Mercy on me

I'm coming home
I'm coming home to your house
I'm coming home to your house
I'll be your queen, upon a throne in your house
I'll make you scream aloud with joy in your house
I'm coming home
I'm coming home to your house
There'll be no war, there'll be no war in your house
I'll bring you peace
