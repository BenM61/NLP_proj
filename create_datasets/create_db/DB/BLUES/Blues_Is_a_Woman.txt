Blues is a woman.
That woman I call my own.
Blues is a woman. 
That woman I call my own.
I'm happy when she's near me,
Sad when she leaves me all alone

Blues is feelin,
That pains your very heart.
Blues iis a feelin,
That pains your very heart.
Don't feel it when she's with you,
But how it aches when where apart.

Blues is song,
I sing both night and day.
Blues is song,
I sing both night and day.
When you got a woman
It makes you sing the blues that way.
