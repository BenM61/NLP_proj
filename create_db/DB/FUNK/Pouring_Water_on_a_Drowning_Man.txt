You push me when I'm falling and you kick me when I'm down
I guess I missed my calling 'cause I should have been a clown
How much more, how much more could I stand
When you're pouring water on a drowning man, I like that

Put me on the right track
And then you let me down
You stab me in the back, yes you do baby
Every time I turn around, oh

Criticize my loving
Won't you try, just try to understand
You're pouring water, I got to tell you about it, on a drowning man

You're pouring water on a drowning man
You treat me like the fool that I am
You brag that I like everything you do
You put salt in my wounds it's sad but it's true

You warm me with your kissin' then you leave me in the cold
How can I know your wishes, when you tell me, when I've never been told, alright
I cry in mercy baby, just try to understand
You're pouring water, I got to tell you about it, on a drowning man, yeah

You're pouring water, ha ha, you see I'm a drowning man
Oh I got tears in my eyes, I'm a drowning man
Don't me drown, oh baby, I'm a drowning man
Don't let me drown
