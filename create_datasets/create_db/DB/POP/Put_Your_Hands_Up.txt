You want fun
Come and get it
You've lost faith
You won't admit it
The time is ticking
Feeling like you don't belong
I wanna start you off
And, baby, turn you on

You want cash
But no rent
You like money
When it's spent
Time is ticking
Gotta get it while it's hot
Or you'll be missing out
On something that we got

Come on
Put your hands up
Put your hands up
So come on
Put your hands up
Put your hands up
Come on
Lift your hands up
Lift your hands up
From a new vibration
Off the medication

You want fame
Go and slum it
To get taste
We gotta suck it
You wanna change it
Gotta get up off your ass
You gotta change it
'Cause you're going nowhere fast

So let's go rock it out
I'll get stoned, trip it out
You wanna shake it
Never fake it
Make it last
'Cause we're the future
With the flavor of the past

Come on
Put your hands up
Put your hands up
So come on
Put your hands up
Put your hands up
Come on
Lift your hands up
Lift your hands up
From a new vibration
Off the medication

I'm feeling it

Put your hands up
Put your hands up
So come on
Put your hands up
Put your hands up
Come on
Lift your hands up
Lift your hands up
From a new vibration
Off the medication

Put your hands up
Put your hands up
So come on
Put your hands up
Put your hands up
Come on
Lift your hands up
Lift your hands up
From a new vibration
Off the medication
