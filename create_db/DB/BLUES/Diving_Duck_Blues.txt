If the river was whiskey
I would be a diving duck
If the river was whiskey
I would be a diving duck
I would swim to the bottom, but I would drink my way up

If you were a good woman
I would never have to roam
If you were a good woman
I would never have to roam
I'd give up drinking whiskey and I would always stay at home

River go to the ocean, ocean go to the sea
Why you ain't no good woman
A mystery to me
River go to the ocean, ocean go to the sea
And like a fish has got to swim, you've got to make a fool out of me

If the river was whiskey
I would be a diving duck
If the river was whiskey
I would be a diving duck
I would swim to the bottom, but I would drink my way up
