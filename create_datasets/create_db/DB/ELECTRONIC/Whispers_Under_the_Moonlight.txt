Whispers under the moonlight
Whispers under the moonlight

I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting
And will I see you again?

I'm still waiting
But I keep on dreaming
Sometimes you seem to be right there, seem to be right there
Sometimes you seem to be right there, seem to be there

I'm still standing but I'm sick of waiting
The moment that I'll see you again
'Cause from the moment we started something, we knew there was something
Sometimes you seem to be right there, seem to be right there
Sometimes you seem to be right there and sometimes you're there

Sometimes you seem to be right there and sometimes you're there
'Cause you're just like no one else

And it seems that you're able to fit squares into circles
Well, you might find
'Cause you're just like no one else

And it seems that you're able to fit squares into circles
You try to fit squares into circles
Well, you might find

I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting
And will I see you again?
From the moment we started something we knew there was something
The way you seem to be right there, seem to be right there

Whispers under the moonlight
Whispers under the moonlight
Whispers under the moonlight
Whispers under the moonlight
