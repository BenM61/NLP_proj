Love letters
Love letters
Love letters

Love letters, all I see
On every day I read
The bits of yellow paper
Addressed from you to me

And every day it shows
Inside a book of stamps
To tell you what I'm up to
And say just how I feel

You've got me writing
Love letters
I'll always write you
Love letters

You've got me writing
Love letters
I'll always write you
Love letters

From far across the sea
They fly from you to me
But still I get no sleep
Oh, my love, don't be mad

'Cause I'll keep on writing
Love letters
I'll keep on writing
Love letters
I'll keep on writing
Love letters
I'll keep on writing
Love letters

You've got me writing
Love letters
Love letters
Love letters
Love letters
Love letters

Love letters
Love letters
Love letters
Love letters

Love letters
(Love letters)
