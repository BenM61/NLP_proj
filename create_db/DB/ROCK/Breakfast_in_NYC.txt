Summers in your heart but I know that you're staying
Taking a ride but it feels like we're paying
For the madness that occurred with a ticket to good times
Hunter promised this but he wasn't ready

For the first time, standing with my friends singing bright light
Saw you going crazy on the dance floor
I've taken one already but I want more
This time I wanna feel it

Breakfast in New York and I know that we're dreaming
Drunken conversations and the things we were scheming
To get out of this town and take a trip underground
How Paitment [unverified] promised this but he wasn't ready

For the first time, standing with my friends in the bright light
Saw you going crazy on the dance floor
I've taken one already but I want more
This time I'm going to feel it

It was the first time, standing with my friends in the bright light
Saw you going crazy on the dance floor
I've taken one already but I want more
This time I'm going to feel it, this time I'm going to feel it
