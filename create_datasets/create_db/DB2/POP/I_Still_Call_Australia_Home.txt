I been to cities that never close down
From New York to Rio and Old London Town
But no matter how far or how wide I roam
I still call Australia home

I'm always travelling
I love being free
And so I keep leaving the sun and the sea
But my heart lies waiting over the foam
I still call Australia home

All the sons and daughters
Spinning around the world
Away from their family and friends
But as the world gets older and colder
Its good to know where your journey ends

Someday we'll all be together once more
When all of the ships come back to the shore
I realise something I've always known
I still call Australia home

But no matter how far or wide I roam
I still call Australia
I still call Australia
I still call Australia home

But no matter how far or wide I roam
I still call Australia
I still call Australia
I still call Australia home
