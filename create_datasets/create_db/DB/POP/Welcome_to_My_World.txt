Sittin in my boxers, eating AppleJacks
Welcome to my world, welcome to my world; ohh
Wacking off to late night Cinamax

Yagar mister and captain crunch, nicotine and the brady bunch
building aboat out of pudding cups
Welcome to my world, welcome to my world

This old shirt is starting to stink

I can take a leak in the kitchen sink

welcome to my world

Welcome to my world, welcome to my world
no stop no go action, without you
