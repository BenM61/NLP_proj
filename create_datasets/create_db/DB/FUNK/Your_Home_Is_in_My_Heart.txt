Don't be afraid. Love has no age.

Even from across the sea
(so far across the sea)
I can hear you calling me
(baby come to me)
Destiny controls it all
No matter where you are
Dream and dare to love again
Your home is in my heart

I know the way I feel about you won't pass
Oh yes it's gonna last and stand the test of time
So your search for love is about to end
Your future holds a place where true love begins
I'll be right there

Even from across the sea
(so far across the sea)
I can hear you calling me
(baby come to me)
Destiny controls it all
No matter where you are
Dream and dare to love again
Your home is in my heart

Take alone a journey 
Just start at the beginning
You won't know where you're goin'
'Til you're there

Even from across the sea
(so far across the sea)
I can hear you calling me
(baby come to me)
Destiny controls it all
No matter where you are
Dream and dare to love again
Your home is in my heart

Is it just physical or is it lasting love?
Please don't give up
We won't know unless we try
