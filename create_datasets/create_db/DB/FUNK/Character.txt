Faces have trouble smiling
When it's less than a merry affair
When you communicate through the writing on the wall
There's no love for you there

You wanted to draw a picture
But your relationship could never hold a pose
You're left with a roomful of sketches
That only hint at the love you wanted to know

Let it out, let it go
Hold back the tears no longer
Let them fall on the floor
Not on your will to be stronger

Who are you
In the face of disappointment?
Where is your character
The one who keeps you going?
The one who keeps you going

Caught you by surprise
How time changes people and places
Would you guard over your ruins like you're doing
If you knew your first kiss was your greatest?

Let it out, let it go
Hold back the tears no longer, listen
When you work too hard to get along
Maybe it's time you moved on

Who are you
When heavy weather is blowing?
Where is your character
The one who keeps you going?

Who are you
When heavy weather is blowing?
Where is your character, baby
The one who keeps you going, going?

The one who keeps you going, going
The one who keeps you going, going
And going, and going, going
