Staring at the flames as they dance in red 
On the corpse of the land 
And there in they're midst are wandering a countless unnamed 
Walking hand in hand 
Blind leading blind aimlessly into the quicksand's of time where they sink 
On the brink of eternity cold and alone I shrink 
At the festering obscene corruption 
And my silence in the face of this mass destruction 

All rise, abandon your shadows and cut ties to your selfish pride 
Fix your eyes on the sun 
Get burned on the in side and turn these tides 

Closed minds ill equipped to deal with this madness 
Hearts far to hard to challenge a sadness that's draining 
The soul of a generation 
Blanketed with tears are faces of nations

All rise, abandon your shadows and cut ties to your selfish pride 
Fix your eyes on the sun 
Get burned on the in side and turn these tides 

Everyone laughs, everyone cries, everyone lives 
Everyone dies and in between they crawl 
Through stagnate realities longing to fly
