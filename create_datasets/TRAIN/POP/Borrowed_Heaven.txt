All beauty all fade away, borrowed 
All moonlight, return today, borrowed 
All sunrise all shooting stars, borrowed 
All earth bound bare feet in day 
you know we're standing on 

Borrowed borrowed heaven 
Borrowed borrowed heaven 

All heartache all rivers cried, borrowed 
Don't stay out too late tonight, borrowed 
I love you don't want to die, borrowed 
You taste like paradise, I know I'm breathing in 

Borrowed borrowed heaven 
Borrowed borrowed heaven 
Borrowed borrowed heaven 
Borrowed borrowed heaven 

You have my life and I will give it back 
But before I do, I'm gonna hold it tight 
This is my prayer 

All body, All skin all bone, borrowed 
All silky, all smooth and warm, borrowed 
Almighty I stand alone 
I know I'm living in 

Borrowed borrowed heaven
