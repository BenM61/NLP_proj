Well I know my dog, 
Anywhere I hear him bark. 
Well I know my rider, 
If I feel her in the dark. 

Ain't it cold for you, mother, 
When you say you don't love me? 
Well that's alright woman, 
You gonna need my help someday. 

You didn't say you didn't love me, 
When you were stretched out across my bed. 
You're drinkin' moonshine whisky, 
And talking all outta your head. 

Ain't but two kinda people, 
In this world that I can't stand. 
Well that's a lying woman, 
And a cheatin' monkey man. 

Well, I feel like snapping, 
My pistol in your face. 
I'm gonna let the graveyard, 
Be your resting place. 

Well I know my dog, 
Anywhere I hear him bark. 
I know my rider, 
If I feel her in the dark.
