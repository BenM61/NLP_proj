And you
Woke from a bad dream
As the ground just broke away

A hand reached towards me
Save me from another day

Does it matter now
How I got here

Sunset watching, city listening
Is there somewhere else to be
Oh, is there somewhere else for me

And you like and you don't even know it
And you take what was given to me
And you play only when you control it
And you like
And you

Tied to a bed frame
No one hears you when you scream

Rape of the body
And a little self esteem

Shall I stay here
Feel held under

Intoxicated by the strange days of fear and power hanging
Over me

And you like and you don't even know it
And you take what was given to me
And you play only when you control it
And you like
And you

Surrounded in the mystery of
Hey I got to go
See you later

Shall I stay here
Feel held under

Intoxicated by the strange days of fear and power hanging
Over me

And you like and you don't even know it
And you take what was given to me
And you play only when you control it
And you like
And you

And your high
And you
