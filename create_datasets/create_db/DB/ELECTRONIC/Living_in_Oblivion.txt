You can't hide the pain,
I can see it scrawled on your empty face.
And I feel the hurt,
It's in the words you say, they make me want to

Scream out to the world,
For taking life for granted and I know.
You are by my side when
I turn to hear you cry,

I am so afraid of living in oblivion
I am so afraid of living in oblivion

Am I so blind? 
With my eyes turned to a different time or hour.
At the end of the day,
When we both run down and our hopes are heavy

Tell me what you will,
'cause I've got to know the truth inside of you.
Can you hear what I say,
When I hold you and you scorn the day? 

I am so afraid of living in oblivion
I am so afraid of living in oblivion

Living in oblivion
Living in oblivion

So I ask again,
Am I so alone and full of pride? 
To never speak out
This is my world, this is my world

Don't tell me now,
I won't feel those words, I won't feel the lies they tell
Can you hear my scream? 
It's for everyone, for everyone

I am so afraid of living in oblivion
I am so afraid of living in oblivion

Living in oblivion
Living in oblivion

La, la, la, la, la, la, in oblivion
