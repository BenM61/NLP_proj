You came close
Close but no cigar
You didn't miss by far
You know you came this close
Close but no cigar
 
Some people sing love songs
Everybody's got one
This isn't my love song
It's more like my love gone wrong song
 
She came to breakfast
And stayed a week
But the lie detectors
Broke down each time she tried to speak
Broke down when she said
 
"You came close
Close but no cigar
You didn't miss by far
You know you came this close
Close but no cigar
No matter where you are
You know you came this close
Close but no cigar"
 
I remember, I remember, I remember
The promise in your eyes
As black as the night I drove you to the airport
And I remember, I remember, I remember
The wide Brazilian sky that swallowed you
 
Then I hit thirty
Guess I can't complain
But I must have been lonely
The night I bumped into Lorraine
She came for coffee
And stayed all night
But the lie detectors
Broke down every time I tried to smile
Broke down like the store of my life
And each dream I missed by half a mile
Broke down when I told her:
 
"You came close
close but no cigar
You didn't miss by far
You know you came this close
close but no cigar
No matter where you are
You know you came so close
Close but no cigar
You didn't miss by far
You know you came this close
Close but no cigar
We're better off by far
But you know we came this close
Close but no cigar
