When you shine so bright,
And the ladies all dressed like a Friday night,
Gee! Will you shine your lights?
Let we all grow wings and it's all right!
Gee! And we are O.K.,
And everybody's out cause we all wanna play.
Gee! Until we all play sound,
When the sun opens up saying enchante!

We've been working hard, we go party even harder,
? my god, he's the queen of ?
Let me taste the stars, but the moon we only ?
Doing what we like it!

We're gonna outrun the sun!
Hey! Dance like tomorrow is never coming!
Whenever we want, we want!
Oh, party like we can outrun the sun!

We gonna ? till the sun down,
The way you shine on, please never come down.
No ? so we run down,
Hey ?
When the sun's out, and you're all free
I feel the weight of the world fading off me
Cause the darkness killing him softly
? the sun is ?

Like I'm in the light, get my shoes, they speak Italian
Not for everyone, it's the D.J. ? the volume.
Let me taste the stars, but the moon we only ?
Doing what we like it!

We're gonna outrun the sun!
Hey! Dance like tomorrow is never coming!
Whenever we want, we want!
Oh, party like we can outrun the sun!

Run, run, run, run, run, run...
We gonna miss it, can't miss it!
We gotta run, run, run, run, run, run...
Gee! We need to make it in time,
We gotta run, run, run, run, run, run...
You think I'm f*ck around?
We gotta run, run, run, run, run, run...

In the middle of the darkest night
We need a wild out!
Everybody coming to play,
I suddenly get there,
Everybody running away,
We let the sun shine.
Nobody's here to stay,
We outrun the sun!

In the middle of the darkest night
I suddenly freakin
Everybody coming to play,
We on the way,
Everybody running away,
We let the sun shine.
Nobody's here to stay.

We're gonna outrun the sun!
Hey! Dance like tomorrow is never coming!
Whenever we want, we want!
Oh, party like we can outrun the sun!

Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Oh, party like we get around the sun!
We gonna get in trouble,
Party till we see trouble!
Avoid the light of day, hey!
We gonna get in trouble,
Party till we see trouble!
Avoid the light of day, hey!
Gotta party, baby!
I'll go where it takes me, takes me
As we outrun the sun!
