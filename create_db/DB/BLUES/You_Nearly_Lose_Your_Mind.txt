Well if you love your mama and you treat her right
But she keeps on fussin' at you every day and night
And she's triflin' on ye they'll do it every time
And when your baby starts to steppin' Lord you nearly lose your mind
Now if your mama's mean take a tip from me
Lock her up at home Lord and hang on to the key
'Cause she won't triflin' on ye they'll do it every time
And when your baby starts to steppin' Lord you nearly lose your mind
But if your mama's good I'll tell you what to do
Give her lots of lovin' and what she wants to do
She'll trifle on ye they'll do it every time
And when your baby starts to steppin' Lord you nearly lose your mind

Now you come home to your mama find your clothes ain't clean
You can bet you're slippin' if you know just what I mean
'Cause she's been triflin' on ye they'll do it every time
And when your baby starts to steppin' Lord you nearly lose your mind
Now you may have a mama who says that she is true
But wait till you get down and out and really leave her too
She'll trifle on ye they'll do it every time
And when your baby starts to steppin' Lord you nearly lose your mind
Now I've been lotta places not much I ain't done
But when it comes to women I just don't trust a one
Because they'll trifle on ye they'll do it every time
And when your baby starts to steppin' Lord you nearly lose your mind
(Really drive you crazy)
