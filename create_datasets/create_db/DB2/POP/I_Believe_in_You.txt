I don't believe you know me
Though you know my name
I don't believe the faults I have
Are only mine to blame

I don't believe that magic
Is only in the mind
I don't believe I'd love somebody
Just to pass the time

But I believe in you
And I believe in you

I don't believe that beauty
Will ever be replaced
I don't believe a masterpiece
Could ever match your face

The joker's always smiling
In every hand that's dealt
I don't believe that when you die
Your presence isn't felt

But I believe in you
And I believe in you
But I believe in you
And I believe in you

And if you ever have to go away
Nothing in my world could ever be the same
Nothing lasts forever, but together 'til then
I'll give you everything I have, again and again

'Cause I believe in you, I believe in
I believe in you, I believe in
I believe in you, I believe in
I believe in you, I believe in

'Cause I believe in you
And I believe in you
But I believe in you
And I believe in you

I believe in you, I believe in
I believe in you, I believe in
I believe in you, I believe in
I believe in you, I believe in

I believe, I believe, I believe in you
