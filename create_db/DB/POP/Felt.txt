Vibrations running through my veins and moving my hips
Filling me up from my feet to the grooves in my fingerprints
Heartbeat skipping, tripping over my words
And my mind keeps replaying all the phrases I've heard
'Cause I'm swallowed up by the touch of somebody new

I felt it for you
I felt it for you
I felt it for you
I felt it for you
I felt it for you

When I'm lying in my bed I see the outline of your head where you used to lie
In the corner by the door, there's a t-shirt on the floor that you left behind, when you said goodbye
Time runs away with me and I'm losing track
Picturing you here and it's taking me back 
To a time before my heart was broken and blue

I felt it for you
I felt it for you
I felt it for you
I felt it for you
I felt it for you

Vibrations running through my veins (I felt it for you, I felt it for you)
Filling me up from my feet (I felt it for you, I felt it for you)

Years went by in a blink of an eye
Finally got you out of my life
Found a cool girl who loves me
Are you still thinking of me?
We were so young and different then
What would you do if you saw me again?
Would you still recognize me?
Would you just walk right by me?
Well I hope you found the love in the heart of someone new
I hope you found the love so true

I felt it for you
I felt it for you
I felt it for you
I felt it for you
I felt it for you
