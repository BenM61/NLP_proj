Y'all know about sixty-nine
Burnin' bones and bedside time
Once again we meet tonight
Get that touch of a magical light

We're gonna hit it
We're gonna kick it
We're gonna break out through the ice
You give us fever 
You give us sweat
You're gonna make us live it twice
Tonight long stick goes boom
Tonight long stick goes boom

The time is right for a ride tonight
To be with you I'd risk a fight
My stick is tight, my blood is hot
Let's do it here, right on the spot

We're gonna hit it
We're gonna kick it
We're gonna break out through the ice
You give us fever 
You give us sweat
You're gonna make us live it twice
Tonight long stick goes boom
Tonight long stick goes boom
