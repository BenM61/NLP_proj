I saw two lovers last night
Down where the ships put to sea
One was the image of you
The other was so like me

I saw two lovers last night
While the sea music played
Music that told of farewell
But I was not afraid

Still I can't erase the memory
Of their kiss and last goodbye
A ship on the far horizon
That last long haunting cry

So tell me now my love:
These two that said goodbye
Say that it just couldn't be
No it never could be
The ghosts of you and I
