Such a wretched waste of time
Such a fool to be so blind
Serpents hide behind your eyes
And I'm their prey tonight

Can we end this mind f*ck please, your treachery's beyond belief
You expect to bring us to our knees with your psychopathic tendencies?
Please be gone and rest assured I see you as you are, perverse
With all your lies and empty words- I fear for you there is no cure

Here we go another game
Designed to butcher someone's brain
Is that emotion I see feigned?
All reason's lost on the insane

Can we end this mind f*ck please, your treachery's beyond belief
You expect to bring us to our knees with your psychopathic tendencies?
Please be gone and rest assured I see you as you are, perverse
With all your lies and empty words- I fear for you there is no cure

Sincerity has not been found
Beneath your self appointed crown
These bitter tears in which I drown
Will soon be yours to drag you down

Can we end this mind f*ck please, your treachery's beyond belief
You expect bring us to our knees with your psychopathic tendencies?
Please be gone and rest assured I see you as you are, perverse
With all your lies and empty words- I fear for you there is no cure
