All because
You proved out to be a better man for me

You build me up with so much affection
(You build me up with so much affection)
And you make me realize my needs
(You make me realize my needs)

You seem to move in the right direction

How can I
How can I show you how
I want to now

Prove all my love
But I'm so afraid
To take a part
Don't break my heart

The way so many lovers do
So good I feel
'Cause the love's real
Having tons of fun

Since the love begun
Huggin' and a lovin'
On and on
Gettin' with the kissin'

On and on
Chills I feel whenever you're near
Stickin' like glue I keep a lovin' you
(On and on)

On and on
Ow!
Keep on movin'
(On and on)

We gotta go
Keep on movin'
Keep on groovin'
(On and on)

On and on
Hey hey hey
(On and on)
On and on
We gotta go

How can I 
Work out this sweet relation
(Let us deal with love)
Keepin' our hearts together
With no temptation
Keepin' us lovin'
Keepin' us lovin'

Going
(On and on)
On and on
(On and on)
On and on
(On and on)

We gotta go
(On and on)
Keep on movin'
(On and on)

Keep on groovin'
(On and on)
On and on
(On and on)
We gone
(On and on)
I want to know

I know you feel like I feel
That's why we've got a love that's real
So let's keep on groovin' the way we do
Let's just keep on movin'
If we're gonna make it through
Ha
