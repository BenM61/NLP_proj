Fairy tales can come true
It can happen to you
If you're young at heart.

For it's hard you will find
To be narrow of mind
If you're young at heart.

You can go to extremes 
With impossible schemes
You can laugh when your dreams 
Fall apart at the seams
And life becomes exciting with each passing day
And love is either in your heart or on its way.

Don't you know that it's worth
Every treasure on earth 
To be young at heart.
