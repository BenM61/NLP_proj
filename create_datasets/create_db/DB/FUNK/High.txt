I guess we'll never get started
Let's save the silence all night
No need for talking about it
Sometimes, the quiet feels so right

High
Over the north star
Sleepless, so far
Together, we are
High
Trapped in the holiday affair
A new silence filled the air

I rest my head on your shoulder
There's nowhere else I'd rather be
Right there, a little bit slower
Feel free to roll another one for me
(Roll another one for me)

High
Over the north star
Sleepless, so far
Together, we are
High
Trapped in the holiday affair
A new silence filled the air

Making way, we sway, we slide, oh
One flight to space, soothing you
It's too good to be true, have more on a rooftop view
Making way, we sway, we slide, oh

High
Over the north star
Sleepless, so far
Together, we are
High
Trapped in the holiday affair
A new silence filled the air

High
