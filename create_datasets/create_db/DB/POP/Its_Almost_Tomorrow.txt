My dearest, my darling, tomorrow is near 
The sun will bring showers of sadness I fear 
You lips won't be smiling, your eyes will not shine 
For I know tomorrow that your love won't be mine 

It's almost tomorrow, but what can I do 
Your kisses all tell me that your love is untrue 
I'll love you forever till stars cease to shine 
And hope someday darling, that you'll always be mine 

You heart was so warm dear, It now has turned cold 
You no longer love me, for your memories grow old 
It's almost tomorrow, for here comes the sun 
But still I am hoping that tomorrow won't come 

It's almost tomorrow, but what can I do 
Your kisses all tell me that your love is untrue 
I'll love you forever, till stars cease to shine 
And hope someday darling, that you'll always be mine.
