I'll wrap up my bones
And leave them
Out of this home
Out on the road

Two feet standing on a principle
Two hands longing for each others warmth
Cold smoke seeping out of colder throats
Darkness falling, leaves nowhere to go

It's spiraling down 
Biting words like a wolf howling
Hate is spitting out each others mouths
But we're still sleeping like we're lovers

Still with feet touching
Still with eyes meeting
Still our hands match
Still with hearts beating

Still with feet touching
Still with eyes meeting
Still our hands match
Still with hearts beating

Still with feet touching
Still with eyes meeting
Still our hands match
Still with hearts beating

Two feet standing on a principle
Two hands digging in each others wounds
Cold smoke seeping out of colder throats
Darkness falling, leaves nowhere to move

It's spiraling down 
Biting words like a wolf howling
Hate is spitting out each others mouths
But we're still sleeping like we're lovers

Still with feet touching
Still with eyes meeting
Still our hands match
Still with hearts beating

Still with feet touching
Still with eyes meeting
Still our hands match
Still with hearts beating

Still with feet touching
Still with eyes meeting
Still our hands match
Still with hearts beating

I'll wrap up my bones
And leave them
Out of this home
Out on the road

Two feet standing on a principle
Two hands longing for each others warmth
Cold smoke seeping out of colder throats
Darkness falling, leaves nowhere to go
