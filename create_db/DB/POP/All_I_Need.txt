Why is half of me always some place close to you?
Tell me how it is
However fire you see me through
You’re the sanity inside the madness
Seeing me when I'm alone
You shelter me and I don't know why it is

When we get lost, where the sky's low
I look to you to guide me home
When there's no ground, nowhere to go
Illuminate it, guide me home

You're all I need, you're all I need, you're all I need
You're all I need, you're all I need, you're all I need

You shine like a light blazing down on me
Instead of reaching out, I'll trace your skin to see
In my head, you’re a constant heartbeat
I feel you rushing through my veins
You're all I need, you always comfort me

When we get lost, when the sky's low
I look to you to guide me home
When there's no ground, nowhere to go
Illuminate me, guide me home

You're all I need, you're all I need, you're all I need
You're all I need, you're all I need, you're all I need

You're all I need
You're all I need

When we get lost, when the sky's low
I look to you to guide me home
When there's no ground, nowhere to go
Illuminate it, guide me home

When we get lost, when the sky's low
I look to you to guide me home
When there's no ground, nowhere to go
Illuminate it, guide me home

You're all I need, you're all I need, you're all I need
You're all I need, you're all I need, you're all I need

You're all I need, you're all I need, you're all I need
You're all I need, you're all I need, you're all I need

You're all I need
You're all I need
