It's a thin line
Between love and hate
It's a thin line
Between love and hate

Three in the morning
My pager reads your number
And at that point, I realized, just starting to wonder
Where I'm at
What I'm doin' and all that
I could have called, but instead
I just sat back
Cause I've been calling you since ten
And now, it's three
I'm not your puppet on a string
So I'm letting you know, it's that
Hates trip
That's it's a thin line
Between love and hate

I know it's wrong, you've been doing it big in love
So now it's time to let you know what's up
Do you remember
Early December, you told me, "Don't
Come over, because
Of the cold and rainy weather"
But

Knock, knock, knock
Who is it

Frost gon' let me
Down

Well, you know I won't let you down
Just remember that

It's
Five in the morning, and you're still tryin' to get through
Swearin' to Frost for hangin' out with the crew
But baby
If this keeps going on
I can't
And just like I can't, I'm gone
We been through
Thick and thin
Good and bad
Arguments lost soon as I walked through the pad
But I need you, trip from the gate
Cause it's a thin line
Between love and gate

I know it's wrong, you've been doing it big in love
And now it's time to let you know what's up
Do you remember
Early December, you told me, "Don't
Come over
Cause of the cold and rainy weather"
But

Knock, knock, knock
Who is it

Frost gon' let me down
Don't let me down
