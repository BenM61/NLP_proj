Just wanted it to be you and me,
Didn't expect any of this unwanted company,
I just wanted you to see me,
Wanted you to see me all alone.

Just wanted us to walk along the shore,
Then to see another shadow at the door,
I just wanted you to leave me,
Wanted you to leave me all alone.
It's the same old thing,
It's always more than you,
Tear my heart again,
'Cause this is what you do,
You always come in two's.
Prepare myself, prepare myself for you,
Oh, plan it out, I hope it doesn't fall,
Well I see your steps, I hear your whisper,
I Feel this heat, I start to shiver, oh!
It's the same old thing,
It's always more than you,
Tear my heart again,
'Cause this is what you do,
You always come in
And I said we'll be fine,
But you had to cross the line,
Can't you see that I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying,
Just wanted it to be you and me!!!
Just wanted it to be you and me!!!
