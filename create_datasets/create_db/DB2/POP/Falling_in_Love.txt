Everyday feels like a Monday
There is no escaping from the heartache
Now I wanna put it back together
'Cause it's always better late then never

Wishin' I could be in California
I wanna tell you when I call you
I could've fallen in love
I wish I'd fallen in love

Out of our minds and out of time
Wishin' I could be with you
And to share the view
We could've fallen in love

Waking up to people talking
And it's getting later every morning
That I realize it's nearly midday
And I've wasted half my life
To throw it away saying

Everyday should be a new day
To make you smile and find a new way
Of falling in love
I could have fallen in love

Out of our minds, out of time
Wishin' I could be with you to share the view
Oh, we could've fallen in love
Oh, we could've fallen in love

I'm sick of waiting
I can't take it, gotta tell ya
I'm sick of waiting
I can't take it, gotta tell ya

I can't take another night on my own
So I take a breath and then I pick up the phone
She said, she said, she said

We could have fallen in love
Oh, we could've fallen in love
Oh, we could've fallen in love
Yeah, we could've fallen in love

Oh, we could've fallen in love
I wish I'd fallen in love
