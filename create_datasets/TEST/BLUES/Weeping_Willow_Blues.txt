I went down to the river, sat beneath the willow tree
The dew dropped on those willow leaves and it rolled right down on me
And that's the reason I've got those weeping willow blues

I went up on the mountain, high as any girl could stand
And looked down on the mean town that took away my lovin' man
And that's the reason I've got those weepin' willow blues

I heard the whistle blowing, the fireman ring the bell 
They're taking away that willow tree that give me this weeping spell
And that's the reason I've got those weeping willow blues

When you're broken hearted and your man is out of town
Go to the river, take the chains and sit down
And if he don't come back to you, I'll tell you what to do
Just jump right overboard, 'cause he ain't no more to you

Folks I love my man, I kiss him morning noon and night
I wash his clothes and keep him clean and try to treat him right
Now he's gone and left me after all I tried to do
The way he treats me, girls, he'll do the same to you
That's the reason I've got those weepin' willow blues
