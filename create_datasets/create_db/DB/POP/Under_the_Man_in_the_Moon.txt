I always thought that love was a game for fools
You put your heart on the line
Every time after time and then you lose

But I'd never seen the stars shinning in your eyes
Now it's all very clear what is happening here to night

It's only me and you
Under the man in the moon
Counting stars up above
And falling in love
Like we're meant to do

It's only me and you
Under the man in the moon
So let's start with a kiss
And make every little with come true

I never thought that I'd be the lucky one
With everything I've been through
I find some body like you to share my love

It's only me and you 
Oh-o the man in the moon
(the man in the moon)
Oh-o the man in the moon
The man in the moon
The man in the moon

It's only me and you 
It's only me and you
