Real life is make-believe
All that glitters isn't gold for me
Save me from everyone
Oh, oh, oh oh

Bite your tongue, don't say anything
You look perfect in this light to me
Save me from everything
Oh, oh, oh oh

They say we can't stay in America
You can be free in America
But I'm sick of listening to everyone
I just want you, oh
I just want you, oh
I just want you, oh

Close your eyes, take it slow
We will find a new place to go
This will all be over soon
Oh, oh, oh oh

And if the stripes keep us apart
I will write your name up in the stars
Keep myself close to you
Oh, oh, oh oh

They say we can't stay in America
You can be free in America
But I'm sick of listening to everyone
I just want you, oh
I just want you, oh
I just want you, oh

Heavy-hearted and I feel so cold
The nights are longer than I've ever known
Wherever you are, come and get me now
(Come and get me now)
When we started, it was long ago
It was perfect and well, yeah it was perfect
Wherever you are, come and get me now
(Come and get me now)
(Come and get me now)

They say we can't stay in America
You can be free in America
But I'm sick of listening to everyone
I just want you, oh
They say we can't stay in America
You can be free in America
But I'm sick of listening to everyone
I just want you, oh
I just want you, oh
I just want you, oh
