Remember me, remember me when you are down
Float me on air and lift me up from off the ground
Oh baby, I feel lazy
So lie here in my arms tonight
Would you deny a poor man's cry, a poor man's cry

Just when I'm finding it hard to breathe
You lift the weight inside of me
Oh baby I see the light
It's burning bright
And we're the stars
Oh Annie you save me from the world
Oh Annie you save me from the world

My head's alive, my head's alive, can't get no peace
You're my escape from this heartache, I need release
Oh baby, this world's crazy
So lie here in my arms tonight
You can't deny a poor man's cry, a poor man's cry

Just when I'm finding it hard to breathe
You lift the weight inside of me
Oh baby I see the light
It's burning bright
And we're the stars
Oh Annie you save me from the world
Oh Annie you save me from the world

Stars, please shine for me tonight
Tonight
