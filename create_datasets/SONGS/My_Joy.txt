Who are you to tell me that I cant go on without you 
Why you tellin me I'm never gonna survive 
But once upon a time yes I believed that lie 
But sorry no way no how you can't control my mind 

'Cause if I thought you were the end all it might be alright 
I would've never left you alone and I wouldn't be on my own 
And I never never woulda grown 
No no ain't no way you gone take away 
My joy, my peace, my strength 
No no ain't no way you gone take away 
My joy, my peace, my strength 

Thank you for the times of all the pain you gave me 
The hate you showed to me taught me how to love myself 
It's funny how you tried to break down my pride and my spirit 
It doesn't even matter now 'cause I done moved on with my life 

'Cause if I thought you were the end all it might be alright 
I would've never left you alone and I wouldn't be on my own 
And I never never woulda wrote this song 
No no ain't no way you gone take away 
My joy, my peace, my strength 
No no ain't no way you gone take away 
My joy, my peace, my strength
