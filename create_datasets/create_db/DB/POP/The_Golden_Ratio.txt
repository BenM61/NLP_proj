Like Maria's love for Antony I felt
Such a West Side Story scene
You lock me up with your love
Now we're partners in crime
And your cronies do your thing

Listen to your heart and follow me
Live and let die
Listen to your heart and follow me

You are the one you're my golden ratio,
The golden ratio
Never felt like this before
You've gotta be my fallen angel
Oh-a-oh, it's the golden ratio, ah-oh ah-oh
It's the golden ratio

So they play in my mind,
Took a bit out of time
Understand but can't forget
Now I'm drawn to you like the desert to rain
Can't undo and won't "fregret"

Listen to your heart and follow me
Live and let die
Listen to your heart and follow me

You are the one you're my golden ratio,
The golden ratio
Never felt like this before
You've gotta be my fallen angel
Oh-a-oh, it's the golden ratio, ah-oh ah-oh
It's the golden ratio

I turn like the flowers
Turning to the burning sun and the giving ground
They don't understand us
They're living in another world, in another time
In another time

You are the one you are my golden ratio,
The golden ratio
Never felt like this before

You are the one you're my golden ratio,
The golden ratio
Never felt like this before
You've gotta be my fallen angel
Oh-a-oh, it's the golden ratio, ah-oh ah-oh
It's the golden ratio
