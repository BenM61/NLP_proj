Yeah, yeah yeah yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh
The right distance, the right distance

My hand grip whiskey like a newborn child and
Last night I must admit it got quite wild now
Morning's approached and I wrestle with a headache
That was spawned in hell by the devil himself
Now it's, not quite clear
But I wonder what shenanigans have, Brought me here
While I'm cryin' out loud and I'm
Feeling quite sorry for myself
I need to check my health
'Cause I ain't mashin' no one but myself (self self self self)

I know we fuss and fight yeah a little bit
I've had a couple drinks well a little bit
I'm beggin' you
Just carry me home (home home home home home)

I know we fuss and fight yeah a little bit
I've had a couple drinks well a little bit
I'm beggin' you (beggin' you)
Just carry me home
I'm all on my own

Smashed up my phone
Not sure of whereabouts
My mum kept on callin' me just tellin' me to sort it out
Sort it out?
Mum look, readin' books and takin' tests won't take away the pain in chest
The aching limbs, the cider breath I sparked up a cigarette
Lookin' out the window at the world
I just ain't ready yet
Such things just get me stressed
Grey hairs are springin' up and hands start to shake a bit
I've still got some whiskey left, maybe I'll just take a sip

I know we fuss and fight yeah a little bit
I've had a couple drinks well a little bit
I'm beggin' you
Just carry me home (home home home home home)

I know we fuss and fight yeah a little bit
I've had a couple drinks well a little bit
I'm beggin' you
Just carry me home (home home home home home)
I'm all on my own

I've kinda lost my throne, I'm absent from the scene
I'm searchin' for a way in life, I'm lookin' for a theme
A plan or a scheme, A road to a better place
I splash some water on my face
Wake up lazy bones
Please just take me home I'm out of my comfort zone
The liquids are wearin' off and
Now I just feel alone
Now I just feel alone
Now I just feel alone
Now I just feel alone
Now I just feel alone, look

I know we fuss and fight yeah a little bit
I've had a couple drinks well a little bit
I'm beggin' you
Just carry me home (home home home home home)

I know we fuss and fight yeah a little bit
I've had a couple drinks well a little bit
I'm beggin' you
Just carry me home (home home home home home)
I'm all on my own
