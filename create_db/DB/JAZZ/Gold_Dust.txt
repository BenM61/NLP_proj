You are the sunrise
You are the bright eyes
You are the wall breeze
You are the silver spread

You are the rolling wave
You are the perfect day
You are the sunrise
The love of my life

You are the roast thief
The air that I breathe
The quint of my can
The bolt of my strength

You are the gold dust
You are the you and us
You are the sunrise
The love of my life

You are the sunrise
You are the bright eyes
You are the wall breeze
You are the silver spread

You are the gold dust
You are the you and us
You are the sunrise
The love of my life

You are the sunrise
You are the sunrise
You are the sunrise
You are the sunrise
