He stumbled into faith and thought
God this is all there is
The pictures in his mind arose
And began to breathe
And all the gods in all the worlds
Began colliding on a backdrop of blue

Blue lips
Blue veins

He took a step but then felt tired
He said, I'll rest a little while
But when he tried to walk again
He wasn't a child
And all the people hurried past
Real fast and no one ever smiled

Blue lips
Blue veins
Blue, the color of the planet from far, far away

He stumbled into faith and thought
God this is all there is
The pictures in his mind arose
And began to breathe
And no one saw and no one heard
They just followed lead
The pictures in his mind awoke
And began to breed

They started off beneath the knowledge tree
Then they chopped it down to make white picket fences
They marched along the railroad tracks
And smiled real wide for the camera lenses
They made it past the enemy lines
Just to become enslaved in the assembly lines

Blue lips
Blue veins
Blue, the color of the planet from far, far away

Blue lips
Blue veins
Blue, the color of the planet from far, far away

Blue, the most human color
Blue, the most human color
Blue, the most human color

Blue lips
Blue veins
Blue, the color of our planet from far, far away
