Into the mists of time and space
Where we have no say over date and place
Don't get embarrassed if it happens a lot,
That you don't know how you started or where you're gonna stop
And if at times it seems insane, all the tears in searching;
Turning all your joy to pain, in pursuit of learning;
Buy a dream and hideaway, can't escape the sorrow;
Your mojo will have no effect, as we head into tomorrow

Round and round like a twisted wheel
Spinning in attempt to find the feel
Find the path that will help us find
A feeling of control over lives and minds

And if at times it seems insane, all the tears in searching;
Turning all your joy to pain, in pursuit of learning;
Buy a dream and hideaway, can't escape the sorrow;
Your mojo will have no effect, as we head

Into the stars and always up
Drinking from a broken cup
Whose golden gleam is fading fast
Praying that it has not passed
Into tomorrow
