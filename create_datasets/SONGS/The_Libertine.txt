The motorway won't take a horse 
The wanderer has found a course to follow 
The traveller unpacked his bags for the last time 
The troubadour cut off his hand and now he wants mine 

Oh no, not me. 

The circus girl fell off her horse and now she's paralysed 
The hitchiker was bound and gagged, raped on the roadside 
The libertine is locked in jail 
The pirate sunk and broke his sail 

But I still have to go 
I've got to go, so here i go 
I'm going to run the risk of being free 

The magicians secrets all revealed 
And the preachers lies are all concealed 
And all our heroes lack any conviction 
They shout through the bars of cliche and addiction 

So i've got to go 
I've got to go, so here i go 
I'm going to run the risk of being free 

And in this drought of truth and invention 
Whoever shouts the loudest gets the most attention 
So we pass the mic and they've got nothing to say except: 
"Bow down, bow down, bow down to your god" 
Then we hit the floor 
And make ourselves and idol to bow before, 

Well i can't 
And i won't 
Bow down 
Anymore. 

No more
