Mother teach me to walk again 
Milk and honey so intoxicating 

And into the fire 
I'm reunited 
Into the fire 
I am the spark 
Into the night 
I yearn for comfort 

Open the doors that lead on into Eden 
Don't you disguise
I'll follow the signs marked back to the beginning 
No more compromise 

And into the fire 
I'm reunited 
Into the fire 
I am the spark 
Into the night 
I yearn for comfort 

Free the water that carries me to the sea 
You I see as my security 

Into the fire 
I'm reunited 
Into the fire 
Oh, I am the spark 
Into the night 
I yearn for comfort 

I will stare into the sun until its light doesn't blind me 
I will walk unto the fire until its heat doesn't burn me 
And I will feed the fire 

And into the fire 
I'm reunited 
Into the fire 
I am the spark 
Into the night 
I yearn for comfort 

Into the fire
Into the fire
Into the fire 
I'm reunited 
Into the fire 
Oh, I am the spark 
Into the night 
I yearn for comfort 
Into the fire
Into the fire
Into the fire
I'm reunited
Into the fire
I am the spark
Into the night
I yearn for comfort
