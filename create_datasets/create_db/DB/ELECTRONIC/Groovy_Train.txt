I saw you walking down our street
Well you looked quite neat
Baggy jeans and long blond hair
Without a care in the world
What happened to the attitude you used to have at school
What happened to the attitude when you broke all the rules

I saw you just the other week
But we did not speak
You turned your back and flicked your hair
As if you did not care
Well I don't care where you come from
I don't give a damn
Well I don't care where you come from
It's all a sham

You're so special
You're so special

She sings

Get on, get on, get on, get on 'the groovy train'
Get on, get on, get on, get on 'the groovy train'

Get on, get on, get on, get on 'the groovy train'
Get on, get on, get on, get on 'the groovy train'
