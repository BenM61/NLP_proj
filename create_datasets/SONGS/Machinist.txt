I don't know how it happened
Was it always this way, and I just couldn't see it?
Heart burning hot enough for the both of us
I never realized how much you were holding back
All the times I felt so plugged in
You were tuning out
I made a channel, a cold ship, a hologram, an abyss

How can I fight a kingdom of your demons?
A mist, so palpable
You can't have it all
Her and all the pleasure
A woman can give

Do you trust me?
Can you feel it?
(Total control)
(Can't let go)
It could be bliss
(Machinist)

Can't speak
You wanted it all
Let go a piece of your heart
All the pleasure gives
Leave me, lost in the night
Shadow, you're running by
I just wanted it all

Here's to the night
A lullaby a creepin'
A song to win your love
See me at all
Throw all your aggressors on
That you want

Can't speak
You wanted it all
Let go a piece of your heart
All the pleasure gives
Leave me, lost in the night
Shadow, you're running by
I just wanted it all
