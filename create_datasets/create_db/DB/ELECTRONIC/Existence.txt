Everything is changing.
A constant flow.
Our existence a photograph.
The time like slow-motion.
Did someone realize
That our life is based
On the history we've been taught?
We are living the results of a lie.
Fundamental facts
Have been changed and changed
Again by the
And we keep their lie alive

Why don't you go on
To kiss the ring on the finger
Of the hand
Which turned your existence to hell.

And while the cold wind blows
We wonder why we feel so alone.
But we're always asking those for help
Who constantly kept us away from the truth.
Don't close your eyes anymore.
Don't cover your ears anymore.
Don't shut your mouth anymore.
Don't close your mind anymore.

You let it go
As if you know you are alone.
You always underrate the ability
To change the state
Of mind
And what you'll find
Is hate so blind
It destroys every way out of here.
