Hoy, hoy,
Baby I'm your boy
300 pounds of heavenly joy.
I'm so glad that you understand
You've got 300 pounds of muscle and man.

This is it,
This is it,
Look what you get!

Now all you girls think your days are done
Don't worry baby,
You could still have fun.
Take me, baby, for your little boy
Of 300 pounds of heavenly joy.

This is it,
This is it,
Look what you get!

If you're sneakin' and hidin'
Then the hidin's bad.
Then you've got a man that you don't like (Aaah!)
Get that cat, baby, and please me mad
Follow me woman we'll have a real good time.

This is it,
This is it,
Look what you get!
