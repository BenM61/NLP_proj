I keep meeting you and meeting
I have promises to keep
I keep making them and leaving
That looks like a carnival wig
And two shiners
Let's just say it crawled across the snow
It looks like your left hand
Don't love me
I won't be afraid
When my ears ring and my head spins
I'll be on your good side
