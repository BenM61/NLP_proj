Hey there you, shattered in a thousand pieces
Weeping in the darkest nights
Hey there you, try to stand up on your own two feet
And stumble into the sky

When the lights go out and you're on your own
How you're gonna make it through till the morning sun'

Sing to the moon and the stars will shine
Over you, lead you to the other side
Sing to the moon and the stars will shine
Over you, heaven's gonna turn the time

Hey there you, looking for a brighter season
Need to lay your burden down
Hey there you, drowning in a hopeless feeling
Buried under deeper ground

When the lights go out it's a waiting game
Never gonna see a day when your world will change

Sing to the moon and the stars will shine
Over you, lead you to the other side
Sing to the moon and the stars will shine
Over you, heaven's gonna turn the time

Sing to the moon and the stars will shine
Over you, lead you to the other side
Sing to the moon and the stars will shine
Over you, heaven's gonna turn the time
