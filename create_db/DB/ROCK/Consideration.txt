I don't think that kindness is a weakness,
I don't have a problem with compassion,
Tell me what you're thinking? 
Would you like to be so high? 

Could you give consideration to something that you did not realize? 
Would you close your ears to the things you did not believe? 

Tell me would you be strong? Would you be the one to carry on? 

Half don't come here, half don't come here,
Half don't come here, so I do.
It's gonna be alright.
