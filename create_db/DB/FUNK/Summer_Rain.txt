Summer rain taps on my window 
West wind soft as a sweet dream 
My love warm as the sunshine 
Sittin' here by me, she's here by me 

She stepped out on the rainbow 
Golden hair shinin' like moonglow 
Warm lips soft as a soul 
Sittin' here by me, yeah, she's here by me 

All summer long we spent dancin' in the sand 
And the jukebox kept on playin' "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" 

We sailed into the sunset 
Drifted home caught by a gulf stream 
Never gave a thought for tomorrow 
Just let tomorrow be, let tomorrow be 

She wants to live in the Rockies 
She says that's where we'll find peace 
Settle down, raise up a family 
To call our own, yeah, we'll have a home 

All summer long we spent groovin' in the sand 
Everybody kept on playin' "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" 

Winter snow drifts by my window 
North wind blowin' like thunder 
Our love's burnin' like fire 
And she's here by me, yeah, she's here with me 
Let tomorrow be
