She captured both Rock and Bird tied 
One to the leg of the other kept them as prisoners 
Until they knew who was master 

Then she threw them to the sky Bird 
With unbarred wings disappeared Rock 
With weighted heart returned 
And rock became her anchor 
And bird became her dream 

Now she stands on the forest floor 
Among the pines and towering firs 
Rock still firm beneath her feet 

Bird perched high above her singing songs of love's betrayal 
'I offered you my endless skies you countered with hoods and chains
This song I sing will be the last to be inspired by your memory'
