She gave it all, you gave her shit
She coulda done, just anything
Or anyone, cause she's a goddess
You never got this
You put her down, you liked her hopeless
To walk around, feeling unnoticed
You shoulda crowned her, cause she's a goddess
You never got this

Now you gotta deal with this glitch on your shoulder
Fucking with a goddess and you get a little colder
It's colder, colder
Fucking with a goddess, and you get a little colder

Finally surfaced above the downs
Feeling her boldest, she came around
'Cause she's a goddess, finally saw this
And now you're back, trying to claim her
'Cause she's gone and now without her
You all alone, cause she's a goddess
You shoulda saw this

Now you gotta deal with this glitch on your shoulder
Fucking with a goddess and you get a little colder
It's colder, colder
Fucking with a goddess, and you get a little colder

Now you gotta deal with this glitch on your shoulder
Fucking with a goddess and you get a little colder
It's colder, colder
Fucking with a goddess, and you get a little colder

Now you gotta deal with this glitch on your shoulder
Fucking with a goddess and you get a little colder
It's colder, colder
Fucking with a goddess, and you get a little colder
