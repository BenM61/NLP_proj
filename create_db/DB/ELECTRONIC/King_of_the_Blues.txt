King of the blues!
Lost his heart to a woman, Lucy was her name.
Lost his heart to a woman, Lucy was her name. Yes, it was.
When he hears her sing so sweetly,
he knows he just can't lose.
When he holds her in his arms he knows that
he's the king of the blues.
He's a Hunter with a Crosscut Saw.
Born Under A Bad Sign.
Caught his baby messin' down the Laundromat.
He Almost Lost his Mind.

He was born in Mississippi 1924.
He was born in Indianola, Mississippi 1924. Yes, he was!
He doesn't need no jester to keep him amused.

Doesn't need no palace,
like Freddie down in Dallas.
You can call him what you like,
I call him king of the blues.

Yeah!
King of the blues.
Let me hear ya!
