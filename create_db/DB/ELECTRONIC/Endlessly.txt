When she walks out she's illuminous
When she turns 'round she is someone else
And I can't fight
Can't find the rule or the exception

She moves towards me endlessly
Endlessly...
Endlessly...

Turns her face into music...
Into fog...
Voice behind me
Says "go on"
So I go on towards her endlessly
Endlessly...
Endlessly... 
 
Switch the scene
Sun is rising
Summer trees
Someone smiling
She moves towards me endlessly
Endlessly...
Endlessly...

She walks out she's illuminous
