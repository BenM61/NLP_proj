Walkin' around uptight 
And lookin' for noise 
Frantic on a Friday night 
Just one of the boys 
Phony defenses, they fall in my way 
A case of hot fire turnin' to stone 
Just a wind up poet with a chip on his shoulder 
Meetin' Saturday mornin' alone 

What's a nice boy like me 
Doin' in a place that never closes? 
I can hardly hear ya' 
Holy moses lookin' so sad 
What's a nice boy like me 
Doin' by the dance floor after hours? 
Dozin' over rows of whiskey sours? 

Feelin' so bad I'm feelin' so bad for me 
(What' cha doin' here boy?) 

Lost in the crowd alone 
I'm drinkin' my third 
I'm hungry for company, 
But I can't think of the words 
Watchin' the girls, my heart in my hands 
What a misplaced, pitiful sight! 
Just a stiff upper lip who'll be knowin' tomorrow 
What he shoulda' been sayin' tonight! 

Wontcha' tell me what's a nice boy like me
