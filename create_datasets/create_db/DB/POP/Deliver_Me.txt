Deliver me, out of my sadness. 
Deliver me, from all of the madness. 
Deliver me, courage to guide me. 
Deliver me, strength from inside me. 

All of my life I've been in hiding. 
Wishing there was someone just like you. 
Now that you're here, now that I've found you, 
I know that you're the one to pull me through. 

Deliver me, loving and caring. 
Deliver me, giving and sharing.
Deliver me, the cross that I'm bearing. 

All of my life I was in hiding.
Wishing there was someone just like you.
Now that you're here, now that I've found you,
I know that you're the one to pull me through.

Deliver me, 
Deliver me, 
Oh deliver me.

All of my life I was in hiding.
Wishing there was someone just like you.
Now that you're here, now that I've found you,
I know that you're the one to pull me through.

Deliver me,
Oh deliver me.
Won't you deliver me.
