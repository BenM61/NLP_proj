Oh, the street is cold
I'm all alone
I've got some money
Don't know what to spend it on

So I take a bus
I see her face
Where did she go?
She was here just a moment ago

I've got love, love so strange
And now my life must be rearranged
So down the subway
The lights kind of make me know
What to do? Yes, they do, oh no

Kill city kills, kills me slowly
Kill city kills, breaks me down
Kill city kills, kills me now, ho no, oh no

I've got love, love so strange
And now my life must be rearranged
So down the subway
The lights kind of make me know
What to do? Yes, they do, oh no

Kill city kills, kills me slowly
Kill city kills, breaks me down
Kill city kills, kills me now, ho no, oh no

Kill city kills, kills me slowly
Kill city kills, breaks me down
Kill city kills, kills me now, ho no, oh no
