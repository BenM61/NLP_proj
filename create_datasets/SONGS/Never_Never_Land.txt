I know a place where dreams are born
And time is never planned
It's not on any chart
You must find it with your heart
Never never land

It might be miles beyond the road
Or right there where you stand
Just have an open mind
And then suddenly you'll find
Never never land

You'll have a treasure if you stay there
More precious far than gold
For once you have found your way there
You can never, never grow old
So come with me where dreams are born
And time is never planned
Just think of lovely things
And your heart will fly on wings
Forever
In never never land
