The last thing that you told me
Echoes in the dark
I wouldn't worry, this is how we are
Was the last time that I saw you
Opening the mail
Only now can I tell
If you wanted a liar
You never said it to me dear
I would have been anything for you
You never asked me to

Leave the light on
Echoes in the dark
Losing Connection over and out
If you needed a spaceman
You never said it to me dear
I would have been anything for you
You never asked me to

If you wanted a psychic
If you needed a martyr
If you were looking for an outlaw
If you wanted a friend
You never said it to me dear
I could have been anything for you
You never asked me to
