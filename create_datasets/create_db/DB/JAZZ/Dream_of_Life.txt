My life was empty when you went away
Even the blue skies above had turned gray
E3ut now that you've come back
My dream of life is here to stay
Those little quarrels that tore us apart
Oh, gee, I can see
They were wrong from the start
But now that you've come back
My dream of life is here to stay
