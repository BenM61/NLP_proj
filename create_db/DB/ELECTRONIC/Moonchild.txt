Moonchild, moonchild

All day long I wait for the sun to disappear
So I can free myself in the cool night air
Take down my hair and feel the wind on my shoulders
With every breeze I feel my heart grow bolder and bolder

CHORUS:
Moonchild, love it when your light shines down on me
Moonchild, want someone to dance the dream
Moonchild, wrap me up beneath the stars
Moonchild, come to me when the night grows dark
Tell me who you are, moonchild

I swear that I can feel your arms around me now
I know you're somewhere, ooh so I'm reaching out
All day a misty shadow follows me
I can hear you calling, darling,
Can't you see
I'm your

Moonchild, moonchild
Moonchild, moonchild
I'm your

Love it when your light shines down on me
Want someone to dance the dream
Come on and wrap me up beneath the stars
Why don't you come to me when the night grows dark
Moonchild
Love it when your light shines down on me
Want someone to dance the dream
Stars
Come to me
When night grows dark
Moonchild
