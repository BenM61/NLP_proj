I know you're tired of waking up on the floor
Pushed to the edge with nothing heavy to hold
Using your clothes as a blanket and a bed
Holding your hands just to lay your head

I know you don't remember ever falling down
Who picked you up, who gathered around
But you don't have to be his girl
And you don't have to be my girl
You can always be your own girl

With the sound of your feet you follow yourself to sleep
Restless and ageless and looking for somethin' to keep
When you finally fall asleep you're awake in dreams
Hanging by the ankles in a skeleton ravine

I know you've kicked the lights, fell on your shoes
Punched out the colors, leaving you the blues
But you don't have to be his girl
And you don't have to be my girl
You can always be your own girl

There's a soft melody that's ringing in my ears
Simple and slow and it always brings you here
With broken crayons you've scribbled on the wall
Shapes of nothing and shadow box them all

Your fingertips are broke and your knees don't bend
Your imagination took the worst hit and cut it's skin
But you don't have to be his girl
You don't have to be my girl
You can always be your own girl

There's a soft melody that's ringing in my ears
And it's the same one you could never avoid in yours
And if you lay down you can hear from tongue to tails
About a tattooed rhythm and drumming by color wheel

Your rung is broken on the bottom of the rope
And you can't tie another, another knot of hope
And you don't have to be his girl
And you don't have to be my girl
You can always be your own girl
