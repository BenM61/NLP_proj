Doesn't matter 'bout the clothes that you're dressed in
It doesn't matter 'bout the color of your skin
All that matters is you're beautiful inside
Aha yeah
Just because you got the look and the body
Just because you got the time and the money
Still remember to be beautiful inside

Looking from the inside out
Tell me what you find
Nothing means a thing if you're not
Beautiful inside

Try giving up the make-up
Try giving up the dressing up
Try giving up the potions
Try living up to higher aspirations

You don't have to be a victim of your ego
No you don't have to be self-centered or deceitful
You'll make it happen if you're beautiful inside
Ah yeah

Looking from the inside out
Tell me what you find
Nothing means a thing if you're not
Beautiful inside

Try giving up the make-up
Try giving up the dressing up
Try giving up the potions
Try living up to higher aspirations

Try living with a heart to give instead of always taking
Respect each other try to be because we should be making
Little time in all our lives is full of inspiration
Keep reaching for higher aspirations

Try giving up the make-up
Try giving up the dressing up
Try giving up the potions
Try living up to higher aspirations
