Hit me, hit me
First I came off alright just like a normal guy
But my tone changed round midnight
Left you message, one hundred
Wish that they all could be deleted, your number
Is hanging on a thread I'm sick and tired
But deep inside I know I'm screwed if you don't call me

Hit me
Baby I'm goin crazy
Hit me
You kill me with your absence
Hit me
Baby I'm goin crazy
Hit me
Call me up or this will be the end

Last time I saw your face
You told me something like
How I can't be replaced
I left you message, one thousand
I guess I must have broke the server, something
Cause all I'm getting is the silence, ringing
Quite honestly I'm screwed if you don't call me

Hit me
Baby I'm goin crazy
Hit me
You kept me with your absence
Hit me
Baby I'm goin crazy
Hit me
Call me up or this will be the end

Left you message, one thousand
Wish that they all could be deleted, your number
Is hanging on a thread, I'm sick, tired
I'm screwed if you don't call me
Hit me
Baby I'm goin crazy
Hit me
You kill me with your absence
Hit me
Baby I'm goin crazy
Hit me
Call me up or this will be the end, or this will really be the end

Hit me
