I was mindin' my own business
Enjoyin' the party, makin' my rounds
One look you shook me out of my senses
Knock me to the ground, heart fall down

Like a rock in a river
Shock and a shiver
Runnin' right down my spine

So dizzy and dazed
Completley amazed
Fallin' in record time

And all you did was walk into the room
Heart fall down, go boom

Sounded like a big explosion
Felt like an earhquake, inside and out
Hit so hard, no wonder I'm shakin'
Knock me to the ground, heart fall down

Like a rock in a river
Shock and a shiver
Runnin' right down my spine

So dizzy and dazed
Completley amazed
Fallin' in record time

And all you did was walk into the room
Heart fall down, go boom

Flash of lightning
Crash of thunder
Helpless, breathless
Goin' under

Like a rock in a river
Shock and a shiver
Runnin' right down my spine

So dizzy and dazed
Completley amazed
Fallin' in record time

And all you did was walk into the room
Heart fall down, go
Heart fall down, go boom

Oh, heart fall down, go
(Like a rock in a river)
Shock and a shiver
So dizzy and dazed
Completely amazed

Oh, heart fall down, go boom
(Like a rock in a river, shock and a shiver)
So dizzy and dazed
Compleley amazed

Oh, heart fall down, go boom
(Like a rock in a river, shock and a shiver)
So dizzy and dazed
Compleley amazed
