That time when we were crossin' the Atlantic
The moment now we reached the middle
You turned to me and said something romantic
'I've won the race and you're the medal'
And all the ocean liners we were passing
Are nothing on a selling whistle
And as the waves were rolling we were dancing
Like we had enough to lose a little

So sure we were contenders
So strong and willing to fight

But it's a long way down
When you're far from the ground
And I've been falling most of my life
And though the sunshine's on
Even after you're gone
I feel sorry for the wasted light
Wasted light

Spill off the port into a crowded mainstream
Looking for somewhere to settle
Soon enough we're lost inside the mystery
We'll be strangers before night settle
With so much to say we've said too little

Back then we were pretenders
So young and ready to fight

Oh
But it's a long way down
When you're far from the ground
And I've been falling most of my life
And though the sunshine's on
Even after you're gone
I feel sorry for the wasted light
I feel sorry for the wasted light

Ouh
It's a long way down
When you're far from the ground
I've been falling most of my life
And though the clock ticks on even after you're gone
I'm just shaking hands with wasted time
I'm still praying you come home one night

Ooh
It's a long way down
When you're far from ground
And though the sunshine's on
Even after you're gone
I feel sorry for the wasted light
I'm still praying you come home one night

So here I am crossing the Atlantic
Maybe see you at the middle
