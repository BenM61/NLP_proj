Baby
Ooo baby
Baby,baby
Ooo um baby
Oh baby

We need to um talk about where 
We're taking this thing
How far we're gonna let this go
We've been here before
Its getting late

It's getting late
Why you gotta be here?
Beside me 
Watching, needing, wanting me
I'm afraid, (Don't Be)
I'm afraid, (Don't Be)
I'm so scared that you'll hurt me, twice 
Baby, oh baby baby baby

Listen, I've already been thinking about you on my mind 
Far too often for you, 
To be here at this time 
You see, one hands on nine and the other's on my thigh
Look,I already played with the idea of you 
Being here in the morning 
And the position for the crack of dawn 
And the conversation before the yawning 
But aah, it's getting late

It's getting late
Why you gotta be here?
Beside me
Watching, needing, wanting me
But I'm afraid, (you say) don't be
But I'm afraid, (you say) don't be
I'm so scared that you'll hurt me twice
Oh Baby baby baby

How's about I let you touch the space
That you left behind,
The day that you stop smiling
The day that the tears started falling 
But now were talking, touching
Almost making sensual again 
We can taste the familiar,
'Cause, the family hour supports it
Of this moment,but was led by the movements cause ah 
It's getting late

It's getting late
Why you gotta be here?
Beside me
Watching, needing, wanting me
But I'm afraid, (you say) don't be
But I'm afraid, (you say) don't be
I'm so scared that you'll hurt me twice 
Oh baby baby baby
Oh baby twice baby baby

I see the memories we replayed
Same space face bodies
I know there's a method to your manliness
But ah I'm a afraid

It's getting late
Why you gotta be here?
Beside me
Watching, needing, wanting me
But I'm afraid, you say don't be
But I'm afraid, and you say don't be
I'm afraid that you'll gonna hurt me baby, baby twice baby

I see the memories replayed, same space, same place
Same bodies baby I know this method to your manliness
But I'm afraid, babe
I see the memories replayed, same space, same place
Same bodies baby I know this method to your manliness
But I'm afraid, baby
