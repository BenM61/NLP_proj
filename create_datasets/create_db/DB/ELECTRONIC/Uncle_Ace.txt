I've got a great idea
Losing my sense of where
Trading the silent ones
I'm sure you know it's wrong
Take it and keep it shut
Unholy triptych of
My sweet un-careful friends
Waiting for April's men

Not like the other girls
Go home and wait for me
I'll be there after five
The others got that V
I'm everything you need
Put all you need in me
I don't need anything
I don't need anything

Does this feel easy 'cause it's all you get from me
Do you have reason to think I'm just what you need
I won't complain if you don't tell me what you see
Does this feel easy 'cause it's all you get from me
