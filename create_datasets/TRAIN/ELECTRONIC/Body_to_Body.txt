Body to body

Body to body, anybody baby
Body to body, everybody baby

Come on everybody, let's have a party, baby
Come on everybody to the house of love, oh baby
Come on everybody, body to body, baby
Anybody is in the house of love, tonight

Baby, fall in love again
Oh, this time you have to win
Oho oho, I'll never let you go
Baby, can't you really see
What you heart will mean to me?

Oho oho, I'll never let you go
Oh when the night is over
I'll be by your side
I'll be your lover, baby, I can't hide

Baby, do you slow my heart?
Everybody wants to start
Oho oho, I'll never let you go
Baby, when you're friends are gone
Call me let me be the one

Oho oho, I'll never let you go
Oh when the night is over
I'll be by your side
I'll be your lover, baby, I can't hide
