I forgot what my password is
Maybe it's "password123"
I feel the technology beat
Deep inside of me, side of me

These days I don't have far to go
Now that I've got you on my screen
When you're down and you're alone
I'll be there watching you

I caught you in my interweb
I caught you in my internet
Well maybe I'm a spider
Or maybe I'm a fisherman

La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

My breathing code is b-binary
And my lunch is still processing
I feel like I know everything
Deep inside of me, side of me

These days I don't have far to go
Now that I've got you on my screen
When you're down and you're alone
I'll be there watching you

I caught you in my interweb
I caught you in my internet
Well, maybe I'm a spider
Or maybe I'm a fisherman

La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

And the world feels smaller
When it's at my fingers
So let's keep talking
Tell me what day is it
Can't turn it off yet, I'm wrapped up with it
So let's keep talking
Tell me what day is it
(Tell me what day is it)

I caught you in my interweb (ah, ah, ah)
I caught you in my internet (ah, ah, ah)
Well maybe I'm a spider (ah, ah, ah)
Or maybe I'm a fisherman (ah, ah, ah)
I caught you in my interweb (ah, ah, ah)
I caught you in my internet (ah, ah, ah)
Well maybe I'm a spider (ah, ah, ah)
Or maybe I'm a fisherman (ah, ah, ah)
