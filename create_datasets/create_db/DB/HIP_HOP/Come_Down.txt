You niggas got me high
Uh, niggas, tell me how?

Hey! Well that's exactly what a nigga came for
Huh, you doin' shots from afar
I'mma meet you at your front door
Uh, so hard to be doing what you really meant for, beauty
Huh, but don't I make it look easy
Don't I make it look good

Now you, drank up all my liquor, come on
What I supposed to do now?
You talkin' all that shit, now come on
You gonna have to back it up
If I get too high now sugar come on
I might never come down
You know I might never come down
Let me get down
You might not never come down
Now let me come down
You might not never come down
Let me get down!

You may never ever come down
It took too long to get this high off the ground
Don't run, just stay awhile

Can't beat it, can't beat it with the big bad door
Can't see her with it's pitch black Gucci pants on
Let me take these bitches off
Let me get the full scope, hold up
Huh, full screen, HD, let me take another picture
Let me pull it to the pre-show
Cool beans, cool beans
That's a whole lot of reefer
Let me help you with the pre-roll

Now you, drank up all my liquor, come on
What I supposed to do now?
You talkin' all that shit, now come on
You gonna have to back it up
If I get too high now sugar come on
I might never come down
You know I might never come down
Let me get down
You might not never come down
Now let me come down
You might not never come down
Let me get down!

You may never ever come down
It took too long to get this high off the ground
Don't run, just stay awhile
You may never ever come down
It took too long to get this high off the ground
Don't run, just stay awhile
