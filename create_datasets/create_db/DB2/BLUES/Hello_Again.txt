Hello again,
I know it's been a long time coming
You say you've been, out there a long time running

You used to be so beautiful
But you lost it somewhere along the way
You used to be so beautiful
But it's easier now to walk away

That wonder wall you're waiting for is now collapsing
Tell me more, but wait no no
Let me find out what you're asking for

You used to be, so beautiful
But you lost it somewhere along the way
You used to be so beautiful
And it's easier now to walk away
Away, away

Now you have everything that you have ever wanted
Oh it's so sad to see
When the hunter becomes the hunted

You used to be, so beautiful
But you lost it somewhere along the way
You used to be so beautiful
And I'm sorry now I don't have more to say
