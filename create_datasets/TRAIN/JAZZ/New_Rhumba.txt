Do you know what it means to walk alone?
And what it means to be, be by yourself?
Do you know what it means when there's no one to bring you good news?
Then you know, you know the meaning of the blues

Do you know what it means to cry alone?
And what it means to cry by yourself?
Do you know what it means to love a woman you can't own?
If you do, then you know the meaning of the blues

I've been weeping and weeping,
Moaning and moaning,
Crying and sighing all the day
I've been hiding my tears
Feel like dying
Wishing love would come to stay
And do you know what it means when the lord is taken away?
I cry, oh I cry
Oh I cry everyday

Yes I know what it means to walk alone
And how it feels to walk by myself
Yes I know what it means to love a woman you can?t own
Yes I do,
I know the meaning of the blues
Yes I know the meaning of the blues
Woo-hoo
