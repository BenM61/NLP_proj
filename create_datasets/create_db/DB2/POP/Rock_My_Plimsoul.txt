Listen!
You can rock me, rock me all night long.
Keep on rockin' me baby, rock me all night long.
'Cause you know what, when you rock me,
My poor back it ain't got a bone.

You can roll me, just like they roll the wagon wheel,
Way down in the country.
Keep on rollin' me baby, roll me all night long.
You know, you can shake, rattle, and roll me,
Till my back it ain't got a bone.
And I won't mind that!  Yea!

Ow! Over here!
Keep on rollin' me baby, just roll me all night long,
I won't mind it.
Keep on rollin' me baby, roll me all night long.
'Cause you know what, when you shake, rattle, and roll me,
My old back ain't got a bone.
So will you do it?

Keep on rollin' me baby,
Rollin' me baby.
Any old way you choose it,
Keep on rollin' me.
Ha, ha.  Keep rollin' me honey,
'Till my old back ain't, got a bone. Over there!

Rockin' me baby,
Rockin' me baby,
Rock me honey,
Rockin' me baby, whoa whoa

I don't mind which way that ya', come on honey, keep on.
Rockin' me baby,
Rockin' me baby,
Keep on rockin' me baby,
You know you'd better keep on rockin' me all night long.
You can rock me baby, yeah, yeah, ow!
