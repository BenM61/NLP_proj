I'll give you the best I can give you, baby 
That's all I can give 
We'll live it the best we can live it, baby 
As long as we live 

What kind of love never turns you down 
What kind of love lifts you off the ground 
Turns your life around 
What kind of love makes you go out in the wind 
And the driving rain 

What kind of love runs through your heart with 
A pleasure so close to pain 
What kind of love 
Only this love that I have 

I'll show you the best I can show you, baby 
That's all I can show you 
I'll know you the best I can know you baby 
As long as I know you 

What kind of love never turns away 
What kind of love never makes you pay 
Hears you when you pray 
What kind of love makes you go out in the wind 
And the driving rain 
What kind of love runs through your heart with 
A pleasure so close to pain 
What kind of love 
Only this love that I have 

This love I know is all I have 
This love I have is all I know 
So I won't let go 

What kind of love makes you go out in the wind 
And the driving rain 
What kind of love runs through your heart with 
A pleasure so close to pain 
What kind of love only this love that I have 
What kind of love only this love that I have
