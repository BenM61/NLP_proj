This is Mr. Capone-e 
Talk about my angel (pretty lady) 
Mo magic from Nb Ridaz 
Com' on 

To me your like an angel (oooh) 
Someone that was sent to me (sent to me) 
From the heavens up high (heaven) 
To make everything alright (heaven must have sent you) 
And this is why I love you baby (you know I love you) 
Oh I love you (I love you) 
(You are my angel) 

You are my angel 
The righteous woman in this world 
You stood by myself 
You're my pretty girl 
Callin' you on the phone is Mr. Capone 
Baby girl I'm for real, never leave you alone 
Those fine words you say, you've gotten me amazed 
To find a love like you 
Only God I got praise for 
For all the right reasons 
You've been sent to me 
I'm passionate 
Wantin' to speak that you're my special lady 
Oh baby, baby 
Words cannot describe 
With your brown sugar eyes 
You've gotten me hypnotized 
So I dedicate this song 
From me to you 
I can be your one and only 
You can be mine too 

To me your like an angel 
Someone that was sent to me (sent to me) 
From the heavens up high (heaven) 
To make everything alright (heaven must have sent you) 
And this is why I love you baby (you know I love you) 
Oh I love you (I love you) 
(You are my angel)com' on com' on 

You're my angel, my dream, my everything 
Recuerdo akel dia que te conoci 
We made a promise 
That we'd always stay true 
Ever since that day I've been there for you 
Give me your hand mami' 
And I will love you right 
And I won't stop till I see the morning light 
I want to kiss you in all the right places 
Get you all excited and keep your heart racing 
Una bonita from around the way 
Knows how to treat a man each and everyday 
Por eso te mando mi amor 
I'm gonna love you till the end and never let you go 

To me your like an angel 
Someone that was sent to me (sent you) 
From the heavens up high (heaven) 
To make everything alright (heaven must have sent you) 
And this is why I love you baby (you know I love you) 
Oh I love you (I love you) 
(You are my angel) 

Back again baby, baby your the one for me 
You bring light to my life, your my cup of tea 
Wake up in the morning just to give you a kiss 
Just make sure your by my side with your beautiful lips 
Sexy senorita, I trust in you 
You're my spiritual waking 
When I'm misty blue 
Somebody told me that this could last forever 
Put my faith in the heaven that brought us together 
Holding hands in the park after dark 
Gazing at the stars 
Never see us apart 
But for now I'm gonna sing you this song 
You're my angel sent to me 
So I can't go wrong 

To me your like an angel 
Someone that was sent to me (sent to me) 
From the heavens up high (heaven) 
To make everything alright (heaven must have sent you) 
And this is why I love you baby (you know I love you) 
Oh I love you (I love you) 
(You are my angel) 

(My angel) 
(Sexy little mama) 
(That has been right there for me) 
That's right 
(You are my everything) 
My pretty lady (my pretty lady) 
(I wanna love you my pretty lady)
