Oh, baby
Let's pick up the pieces
And let's work this thing out

Bring back the love of yesterday
From me, you stole your love away
The look of love has left your eyes
Replace the pain and despise

I can feel a chill in the air
It makes me cold
And filled with despair

This raw silence
Leaves me dangling in space
I'll sacrifice tomorrow
Just to see your smiling face

The seeds of jealousy are
Destroying the love you have for me
There's no other woman near
?? you might love again

Bring back the love of yesterday
Don't turn your back on me this way
My world is all wrapped up in you
Deep in your heart, you know it's true

So come on, bring it back
Bring it on back now
Bring it back, bring it on back, girl
Bring it back, bring it on back now
Bring it back, bring it on back now

Yesterday, your love was warm and tender
But now today, you ?? love ??
Won't you tell me what's troubling your mind
Maybe the two of us, a solution we can find

I'll love you twice as strong
Til every seed of doubt is gone
There's no other woman near
?? you might love again

Bring back the love of yesterday
Bring it on back now

Bring it on back now

Girl, you know and I know
We had a good thing going
And all those good times
Ain't no sense in blowing

Ohh...

Bring it back, bring it on back now
Bring it back, bring it on back now

You and me, we used to be
So good, so good
Now, can't you see
Bring it on home
