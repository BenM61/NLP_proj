Hide and seek is a game
We'll teach you how to play
Close your eyes
Really tight
Wake your duck
Like the guys

The party never ends
The game begins again
The party never ends
The game begins again

The party never ends
The game begins again
The party never ends
The game begins again

Climb the stairs to the top
Bruise a duck that don?t stop
Getting close
Really warm
Now you're cold
On the floor

The party never ends
The game begins again
The party never ends
The game begins again
The party never ends

The game begins again
The party never ends
The game begins again
The party never ends

The game begins again
The party never ends
The game begins again
The party never ends

The game begins again
The party never ends
The game begins again
