Wish I could find the words to say
To change your mind and make you stay
I've loved you so very long
But I know that's not the way
To stop you walking out that door
If you don't love me anymore
Lord if I could there's no price I wouldn't pay

I go to bed I try to sleep
I lie in between
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
And I try so not to dream

In my arms I hold you near
With my lips I kiss you dear
I won't want to wake up
And face this new day

Only one heart, only one heart
What made you take it and break it apart?
Only one heart, only one heart
Lord why did you make us with only one heart?

I go to bed I try to sleep
I lie in between
And I pray the load my soul to keep
And I try so not to dream

Only one heart, only one heart
What made you take it and break it apart?
Only one heart is all I can give
Only one heart for as long as I live

Only one heart, only one heart
Lord why did you make us with only one heart?
