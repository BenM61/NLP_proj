want to climb down your chimney, baby, I want to put a present on your tree
I'm gonna climb down your chimney, baby, I'm gonna put a present on your tree
I want to show the whole world, baby, oh, what you mean-a me

I think about you baby, honey, on ev'ry holiday
Know that I think about you baby, honey on ev'ry holiday
I'd make Christmas come twice a year, darlin'
If I only had my way

(I have mine)

I want to be your Santa Claus, baby, if it's the last thing I'll be
I want to be your Santa Claus, baby, if it's the last thing I'll be
Hang a present on your tree, darlin', show you what you mean-a me

(I hear ya, Jimmy)
