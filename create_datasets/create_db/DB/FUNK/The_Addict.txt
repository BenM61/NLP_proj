How can you call yourself a player
When you're just half of a man
You truly feel that you're the savior
And my wish is your commend
You're driving out to the desert
To figure out the master plan
Feels like you're in heaven
But in reality it's just dust and sand

Stop it, turn off, figure it out
Tell me your reasons why you're in doubt
I help you out

Watch out for the addict
He's always trying to break you down
Watch out for his madness
'Cause it's hard to turn back around
Even with a love so strong
It couldn't drag you of his charm
Watch out for the addict
He's always trying to break you down, down, down, down, down

I slowly watched you moving closer
To a world without a home
So many times I thought I'd saved you
But you just slipped right trough my hands
Stuck in the game of hazard
Where no one is winning, man
But I will never leave you stranded
I'll stand the fight and do what I can

Stop it, turn off, figure it out
Tell me your reasons why you're in doubt
I help you out

Watch out for the addict
He's always trying to break you down
Watch out for his madness
'Cause it's hard to turn back around
Even with a love so strong
It couldn't drag you of his charm
Watch out for the addict
He's always trying to break you down, down, down, down, down

Watch out for the addict
He's always trying to break you down
Watch out for his madness
'Cause it's hard to turn back around
Even with a love so strong
It couldn't drag you of his charm
Watch out for the addict
He's always trying to break you down, down, down, down, down

Watch out for the addict
He's always trying to break you down
Watch out for his madness
'Cause it's hard to turn back around
Even with a love so strong
It couldn't drag you of his charm
Watch out for the addict
He's always trying to break you down, down, down, down, down

Watch out, watch out, watch out
