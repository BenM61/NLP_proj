Hanna Hanna, she sing
mixed emotion and a garden strange
Hanna Hanna, she sing

We're living on a catwalk, catwalk
and swimming with the sharks

Tape record her and telephone
conversations in pyramids alone
Why should I stop to think what they're about
why should I stop, stop to think what they're about

We're living on a catwalk, catwalk
and swimming with the sharks
biting into poison, poison
in a city all full of fucking sharks

She sing
a guitar plays
in a garden strange

Hanna Hanna, she dream
mixed emotion and a garden strange
she never there, she never there
Hanna Hanna, she dream
