Remember a time when the summer'd never end 
The whole world was waiting for me and my best friend 
We'd sneak out and mess around, made up silly tunes 
We sat by the bonfire staring at the moon 

[Chorus]
Where are the days of summer
On top of the world unstoppable 
Where are the days of wonders
When nothings impossible 

We ran for the rainbow, the wind through sun blond hair 
Feeling so invincible

[Chorus]

Where are the days of summer
The taste of a coming miracle 
Where are the days of wonders
When life was just beautiful 

We laid down in the grass 
Put our feet towards the sky 
Pretending we could walk on clouds 

Remember watching another rising sun 
We promised each other to stay forever young 
Where are the days

[Chorus]

Where are the days of summer
The taste of a coming miracle 
Where are the days of wonders
When life was just beautiful 

[Chorus]
