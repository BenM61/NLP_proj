You're designed so intelligent
Ain't no way that was an accident
Come on shake your monkey hips
My pretty little creationist
Oh yeah!

Ain't gonna anthropomorphism you
Or perversely polymorphisise you 

Little girl you look so sweet
You gotta dance like a monkey, dance like a monkey, child

You just started ten thousand years ago
Presto Adam and Eve and go man go
Abel died, Cain took his life
And headed straight to the jungle to find a wife

Non-believers blame it all on apes
It's monkey time - I want to see you shake

Evolution is obsolete
You gotta dance like a monkey, dance like a monkey, child
Stomp your hands and clap your feet
You gotta dance like a monkey, dance like a monkey, child

Oh one more time yo!
It's monkey time!!

c'mon pretty baby, won't you take a chance?
Be my natural selection, dance dance dance
Exorcise your demons with that monkey grin
'Cause we're gonna inherit the wind

Let 'em fight it out in the supreme court
That's such a ignorant indoor sport
Wave your arms and legs in the air
Rock it like a monkey like ya just don't care

Evolution is so obsolete
Gotta stomp your hands and clap your feet - come on!

You gotta dance like a monkey, dance like a monkey
You gotta dance like a monkey, dance like a monkey, child
Dance like a monkey, dance like a monkey, child
Dance like a monkey, dance like a monkey
Dance like a monkey, dance like a monkey, child
