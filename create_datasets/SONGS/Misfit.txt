Sensitive child keep running wild in a confined space
You're not to blame 'cause you're not the same
Get on the case crazy sheep, you are the odd one out

Crazy sheep let them know what you're all about
Misfit freak that's on the street
Well, I can see the sorrow in your eyes

How long? how low?
How high can you go?
There'll be a bind for every kind, you'll see

Sensitive child your threat is so mild, it worries me
Build yourself some protection to avoid the injection
Then you can be happy

Crazy sheep you are the odd on out
Crazy sheep let them know what you're all about
Misfit freak that's on the street
Now I can see the sorrow in your eyes

Set your mode to emotion, your secret potion
Designed to satisfy your soul
And underneath your broken dreams
You need to satisfy your soul

Misfit freak that's on the street
Now I can see the sorrow in your eyes

Too fat, too thin, you lose or you win
This may come as some surprise
Too tall, too short, too loose or too taut
There'll be a bind for every kind

Misfit freak that's on the street
Now I can see the sorrow in your eyes

Too fat, too thin, you lose or you win
You've got to satisfy your soul
And underneath your broken dreams
You need to satisfy your soul
