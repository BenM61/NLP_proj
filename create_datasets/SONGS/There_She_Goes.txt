With her body shaped like a rock guitar
There she goes like a shooting star
Make you wanna play
Makes all the boys them say

Redone, Taio Cruz, Mr. worldwide

Thought I knew what sexy was but uhuh that just changed
She's a pop star, rock star
Fighter, lover
She knows exactly what she's doing, I think she's a pro
When she's walking to the room she make sure that she know
She's a thriller, killer
Dance floor filler

There she goes looking like a star
With her body shaped like a rock guitar
There she goes like a shooting star
Make you wanna play
Makes all the boys them say

There she goes

She'd like to chew you up and then she'll spit you out
She's a pop star, rock star
Fighter, lover
Oh no don't think that girl a lighter, she don't give a what
Yeah she likes to play with fire and she burns it up
She's a thriller, killer
Dance floor filler

There she goes looking like a star
With her body shaped like a rock guitar
There she goes like a shooting star
Make you wanna play
Makes all the boys them say

There she goes

There she goes looking like a star
With her body shaped like a rock guitar
