We wasted so many truths
That we depend
On getting by
Another lie
On every other thing that dies
And as his voice beckons out
I hear the end
The end of trauma slowly setting in
My body seems to stop and freeze
Stop
Well I just dance the way I feel
Stop breathing
Imagine none of this is real
Imagine none of this is real
Well I just dance the way I feel
Well I just dance the way I feel
Well I just dance the way I feel
A simple crowd makes a movement on my space
I'm lashing out
I'm crashing down
On all the people in my way
I'm banning all of these ??? from this place
This place is ruined been affected
After all the time I paid
Stop
Well I just dance the way I feel
Stop breathing
Imagine none of this is real
Imagine none of this is real
Well I just dance the way I feel
Stop
Well I just dance the way I feel
Stop
Well I just dance the way I feel
Moving on to someone else
You're always open with yourself
But no one
I talk to no one
Always falling short of help
I choose to take this by myself
And go
And I just go
Stop
Well I just dance the way I feel
Stop breathing
Imagine none of this real
Imagine none of this real
Well I just dance the way I feel
Stop
Stop
Well I just dance the way I feel
