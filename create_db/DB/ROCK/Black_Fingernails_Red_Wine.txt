Black fingernails, red wine
I wanna make you, all mine
A lot of people, under ground
You wanna get there
You gotta go straight down

Straight down

There's a culture, everywhere
Smoke clouds, hang in the air
So loud, can't hear you talk
You and I
Should take a walk downtown

Straight down
Downtown
Straight down

The argument over God, continues
In this house
All of us stand and point our fingers
At the ground
All of us stand and point our fingers

Straight down

Red letter day, black heart
It's gonna tear you, all apart
So loud, can't hear you call
You and I
Are gonna fall straight down

Straight down
Downtown
Straight down

The argument over God, continues
In this house
All of us stand and point our fingers
At the ground

The argument overall, continues
In this house
All of us stand and point our fingers

Straight down
Straight down
Straight down

Black fingernails, red wine
I want to make you, all mine
A lot of people, underground
You wanna get there
You gotta go straight down

The argument over God, continues
In this house
All of us stand and point our fingers
At the ground

The argument overall continues
In this house
All of stand and point our fingers

Straight down
Straight down
Straight down
