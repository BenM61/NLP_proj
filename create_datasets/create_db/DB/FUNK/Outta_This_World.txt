Houston
We got a problem
Said I'm calling Houston
We got a problem

Hey
Baby out of space, or a far off place
She's in front of me I'm standing still
Feels like magic, and she has it on me
I'm frozen, almost I'll

This love of another kind
So out there it blew my mind
This love of another kind
I can never find never find it

She's got me in a trance
The way that baby dance
And I just wanna hold her body close
The look that's in her eyes
It's got me mesmerized
And where she's coming from nobody knows

She's outta this world
She's outta this world
She's outta this world world world
She's outta this world

Now she's taking me to a galaxy
And I can't believe I'm touching her
And she has me where there is no gravity
And I'm floating up off this earth

This love of another kind
So out there it blew my mind
This love of another kind
I can never find never find her

She's got me in a trance
The way that baby dance
And I just wanna hold her body close
The look that's in her eyes
It's got me mesmerized
And where she's coming from nobody knows

She's outta this world
She's outta this world
She's outta this world world world
She's outta this world
