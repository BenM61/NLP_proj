Well I've been mistreated - been lied to and cheated
Misled and abused - just like an old rag you threw away
First you filled me with thunder - then you let me go under
You can run - you can hide
But you ain't going to get away

'Cause you're under suspicion of
Leavin' the scene of a broken heart
Under suspicion of a hit and run love affair
You ain't got a conscience and made
Me the victim of a cruel and unusual crime
Now you're under suspicion - under suspicion
Under suspicion of a hit and run love affair

No matter where you'll be going
I've got ways of knowin'
And somewhere down the line
You're gonna have to pay.

'Cause you're under suspicion of
Leavin' the scene of a broken heart
Under suspicion of a hit and run love affair
You ain't got a conscience and made
Me the victim of a cruel and unusual crime
Now you're under suspicion - under suspicion
Under suspicion of a hit and run love affair
