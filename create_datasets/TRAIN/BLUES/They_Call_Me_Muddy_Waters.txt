They call me Muddy Water, I'm just as restless man as the deep blue sea
Oh yeah they call me Muddy Water, I'm just as restless man as the deep blue sea
You know I've been like that, ever since my baby been gone from me
The night she left me, you know the rain boy was pouring down
Oh yeah the night the little girl left me, you know the rain was pouring down

You know I was the most bluest man, in this whole Chicago town
I got a brand new babe, she just as sweet man as a girl can be
Oh Lord I got a brand new girl, she just as sweet man as a apple on a tree
I want to tell all you people, how the little child been sending me.
