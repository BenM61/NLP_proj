It's wonderful to look into your eyes
And realize you care a little bit
It's wonderful to know that you love me

It's glorious to feel that I'm a part of you, sweetheart
To share your happiness
It's marvelous how lovely love can be

Who dreamed that I'd be allowed
Through the doorway of heaven?
I'm drifting high on a cloud
You're an angel and this is heaven

It's wonderful to have your lips divine combined with mine
And dream forever more
It's wonderful to know that you love me

Who dreamed that I'd be allowed
Through the doorway of heaven?
I'm drifting high, high on a cloud
You're an angel and this is heaven

Oh, it's wonderful to have your lips divine combined with mine
And dream forever more
It's wonderful to know that you love me

It's glorious
It's marvelous
Oh darling, it's wonderful
