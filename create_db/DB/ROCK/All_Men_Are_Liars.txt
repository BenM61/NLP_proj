All men (all men)
All men are liars their words ain't worth no more than worn out tires
Hey girls (girls) bring rusty pliers to pull this tooth
All men are liars and that's the truth

Do you remember rick astley?
He had a big fat hit that was ghastly
He said I'm never gonna give you up or let you down
Well I'm here to tell ya that dick's a clown
Though he was just a boy when he made that vow
I'd bet it all that he knows by now

All men (all men)
All men are liars their words ain't worth no more than worn out tires
Hey girls (girls) bring rusty pliers to pull this tooth
All men are liars and that's the truth

Among god's creatures man must be
The most slimy and slippery now
There stands the naked ape in a monkey suite
Behind a little mustache he grew, the shifty brute
All the ones not choking on the words they ate 
Are aweating on getting their stories straight

All men (all men)
All men are liars their words ain't worth no more than worn out tires
Hey girls (girls) bring rusty pliers to pull this tooth
All men are liars and that's the truth

All men (all men)
All men are liars their words ain't worth no more than worn out tires
Hey girls (girls) bring rusty pliers to pull this tooth
All men are liars and all men are liars, all men are liars, all men are liars 
And that's the truth
