Build me a bridge
Burn me a fire
Rest something in my empty hands
Fill it with light
Fill me tonight
I figured that you would understand

Up until dawn
Sweat on your palms
Feeling you poor me in out in
Under again
Under my skin
Guiding me through this hall of fears

Sweet things build on these
Sweet things build on me
Sweet things build on these
Sweet things bring to me

Sing in my head
Omnipotent
Circling momentum round and round
Quenching my thirst
First for my thought
Second to fill my silent mouth

Sweet things build on these
Sweet things build on me
Sweet things build on these
Sweet things bring to me

Sweet things build on these
Sweet things build on me
Sweet things build on these
Sweet things bring to me
