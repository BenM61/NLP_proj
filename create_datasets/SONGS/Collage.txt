Blue for the blue I feel when I'm feeling down
In the ground, feeling down
That could be most any day
Green for the eyes, take a look around
When the sun goes down
And the sun goes down in the strangest way

Red for the light, gotta stop this thing
Find a song to sing that is everything
That I meant to say
I meant to say

Green for the lives that are dry like the world
Never see the good that's done the bad
It's too late to see

Two of us make it easier
To read the signs, memorize the lines
Won't you stay with me?

One for the road, I'll be on my way
Come another day when the things we say
Find a way to be
A way to be

Autumn calls for a change of year
Bringing winter near, oh I scream "The ground
And the skies are fine"
Wintertime is a razor blade
That the devil made, it's the price we pay
For the summertime

Spring days come and it's hard to know
Where the rain comes from, where the children go
It's a nursery rhyme
A nursery rhyme
