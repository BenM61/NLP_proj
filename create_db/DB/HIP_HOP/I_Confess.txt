Verse One:

Word life boo, I checked you flexin wit' cha crew
 lookin sweet enough to chew wit them saint eyes like tha brew,
roughneck mannerism, fly disposition,
ya live like channel sparkin' like mad-izm,
my mission, is gettin into you like a religion,
my woman's intuition tells me cupid's arrow's hittin,
you're the prince with the glass slipper that my foot could fit in,
this feelin that I have is never endin, I'm sendin, my love like Zhane' up
in a box
with the bow up on the top, cause, for you I got the hots so
please accept these feelings I possess i'm like a damsel in distress in
pursuit of happiness, I confess
chorus: I've been really tryin' baby
tryin to hold back these feelings for so long
and if you feel, like I feel baby
come on, ohhh, come on

Verse Two:

Many men wit mass appeal expand across the globe by the mills,
but still I picked you like a daffodil
cause you thrill me like magnetic fields that give my body chills,
perserve my chocolate ties and it's a thrill; I'm sayin
that when you swing my way I, get a sudden rush,
that entices me not to keep it on the hush-hush,
boy times girl times lust equals us,
and you can count on that like you would an abacus so
bust the equation, baby cause I'm facin the fact that I only think of you
on two occasions, but I'ma max once I get this off my chest, and just let
nature do the rest..
I confess

Chorus

Verse Three:

I want to be down like brandy with you handy for tha duration,
engage in electric relaxation,
build a conversation, probe ya intellect,
put ya manhood to the test, but not just ya physical, ya individual is what
I'm after,
ya heart I want to capture, I'm open like a space that NASA explores,
truly do adore, every little move you make and more, my word is born
but I could go on and on throwin hints,
that I'm tha chick, you should be celebratin life wit,
so instead I felt it best if I just,
stood and represented in the flesh,
that I confess...

Chorus
