After we leave
Be all you need
Are those Victoria?s Secrets?
Let me see
What's your fee?
Never mind baby, you owe me
For them drinks at the bar
And for smoking this weed

He ain't like me
I can make your days and nights
Look like fantasy
He ain't got nothing on me
My garage looks like the Dupont registry
I'm so superb
Shawty what's the word?
If you lookin? for love, love, love
I give you what you deserve

Bring your a** to the crib
Ditch dat ni**a
You trying to f*ck or you still playin??
Ditch dat ni**a
You need a grown a** man girl
Ditch dat ni**a
Understand what I'm sayin? girl?

Ditch dat ni**a
Got her out on the floor like
Ditch dat ni**a
I got ?em out on the floor like
Ditch dat ni**a

She got needs
She's laid up in my Rolls
She got your text
?Do you want to get it??
She said, ?Not yet?
After the finale
She got you on the phone
Said that she wasn't coming home
Then she's downloading my ringtone

He ain't like me
I can make your days and nights
Look like fantasy
He ain't got nothing on me
My garage looks like the Dupont registry
I'm so superb
Shawty what's the word?
If you lookin? for love, love, love
I give you what you deserve

Bring your a** to the crib
Ditch dat ni**a
You trying to f*ck or you still playin??
Ditch dat ni**a

Got what you want
Grab what you need
Have another drink
I'm taking her with me
Enter the Phantom
Proceed to creep
Exit the Phantom
Up in dem sheets

Grab my neck
Squeeze my hands
Touch your twins
Squeeze your a**
Not too slow
Not too fast
DJ run this mu-f**ka back

Bring your a** to the crib
Ditch dat ni**a
You trying to f*ck or you still playin??

Now I got what she want
And she see what she want in me
And I ain't here to beef
Even though you fightin?
Let it be
She's coming with me
She's leavin? with me
She's coming with me
She's leavin? with me

Now put the back out on this b**ch
Know you got a little money
In the club talkin? honey
Heard you got a little car
But she comin? with me, me, me, me, me, me
'Cause I got a lot of love
Now she wanna be my girl
Keep throwin? that money up
She's comin? with me, me, me
