Somewhere somebody sayin' this somebody sayin' that, but never a fact

Somebody told you I was playin' for a fool
Somebody told you, that I was untrue
They keep you guessing, where I'm at?

Somewhere somebody sayin' this somebody sayin' that, but never a fact

Somebody told you I was running around
Somebody said when Mr. Brown across town
If you don't see a shark, you might be flat

Somewhere somebody sayin' this somebody sayin' that, but never a fact

Why, why, why you except those lies, wake up be smart
Open you eyes,
If you keep on listening at 'em, I know you'll see
They'll convince you 1 and 1 is 3

Somebody told you, I was running around
Somebody said, when Mr. Brown across town
If you don't see a shark, you might be flat

Somewhere somebody sayin' this somebody sayin' that, but never a fact

Somewhere somebody sayin' this somebody sayin' that, but never a fact

Somewhere somebody sayin' this somebody sayin' that, but never a fact
