Unchain my heart, baby let me be
'Cause you don't care, help me, set me free

Unchain my heart, baby let me go
Unchain my heart, 'cause you don't love me no more
Every time I call you on the phone
Some fellow tells me that you're not at home
Unchain my heart, set me free

Unchain my heart (unchain my heart), baby let me be
Unchain my heart (unchain my heart), 'cause you don't care about me
You got me sewed up like a narrow case
But you let my love go to waste
Unchain my heart, set me free

I'm under your spell, like a man in a trance, baby
Oh but you know damn well, that I don't stand a chance

Unchain my heart (unchain my heart), let me go my way
Unchain my heart (unchain my heart), you were mean that day
Why lead me through a life of misery
When you don't care a bag of beans for me
Unchain my heart, oh please, let me free, alright

I'm under your spell, just like a man in a trance, baby
But you know damn well, that I don't stand a chance

Please, unchain my heart (unchain my heart), let me go my way
Unchain my heart (unchain my heart), you were mean that day
Why lead me through a life of misery
When you don't care a bag of beans for me
Unchain my heart, please, let me free, oh set me free
(Unchain my heart) you don't care
Oh, don't you let me go (unchain my heart) if you don't love me no more
(Unchain my heart) 
(Unchain my heart) let me go
I'm under your spell (unchain my heart) just like a man in a trance
And you know damn well (unchain my heart), that I don't stand a chance, no, oh
(Unchain my heart) you don't care
So please set me free (unchain my heart)
