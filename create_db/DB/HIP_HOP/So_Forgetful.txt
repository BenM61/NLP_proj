Boy wonder, one summer, I was stunting
Winter falls when I cake more
Bag models and crush 'em
I ain't never been a cuffa,
My lifestyle is custom
Chromy Cartier Carrot glare keep me hustlin,

Lamborghini sunk in
Dimes humpin in tight bikinis when I'm out doin somethin,
I know it's something for me to notice you,
Problem is I'm thinking her too,
And ya crew, a girl smooth,
Got a body like a spur do, and I wanna cruise,
Hit gears to make this whole move,
I'm so cool, ice grills for my cold jewels,
Make my own rules, baby I'ma finna rap in old school
She asked why should she, you think you special?
Hell fucking yeah, now come here, let me bless you,
Hit yea no air hit you in the pretzel,
And I don't remember how I met you, so forgetful.

[Chorus]
I deal with a lot of pretty girls
So forgive me if I don't remember you!
So forgive me girl I'm so forgetful
There's too many New York City girls
So forgive me if I don't remember you!
If I don't remember you!

Wet spots on the mattress
Champagne splashes, diamond glasses,
A couple backstage passes, and they find
Yeah, how we gettin home, 'cause the keys are gone
Get dressed quick bitch grab my phone,
Walkin out alone, smellin like chronic bag cologne,
Drivin home still drunk hope they don't pull me,
Cause I'm driving with the pully and its loaded fully, feel me?
Game tight girl I'm ain't a rookie, hear me?
I love chips treat em like my family,
And we got a thing for the light, ball out, fall out,
Do the same thing tonight, flash backs, ass claps,
It's goin' down as long as she black jack,
I'm fucked up it, lets hope I can snap back,
The last text I got says I missed you,
I must of missed something...so forgetful

[Chorus]
