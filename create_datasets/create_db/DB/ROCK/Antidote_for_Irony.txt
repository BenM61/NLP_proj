The antidote for irony is held safe far away from you
I heard you say just this one time, so I guess I'll, just sit down and see for myself
I'll go where you take me

And I feel the lies could burn your eyes
And I'll wait till you say please
You said this counts for so much more

Wait till tonight
You'll see exactly what I've seen and can't believe
I'll lie at birth what it was
To find a way to kill the pain

Put down, put down the loaded gun
Pointed straight between my eyes
'Cause you can't fight fair tonight
With words that cut like knives

And I want to see you do the things you never do
And I want to feel your skin but now the ceiling spins in the room get cold
I'll go where you take me
You feel the lies cover their eyes
And I'll wait till you say please
You said this counts for so much more

Wait til tonight
You'll see exactly what I've seen and can't believe
I'll lie at birth what it was
To find a way to kill the pain

Put down, put down the loaded gun
Pointed straight between my eyes
Cause you can't fight fair tonight
With words that cut like knives

Put down, put down the loaded gun
Pointed straight between my eyes
'Cause you can't fight fair tonight
With words that cut like knives

The day will come and it kills me
That the thing that I gave you will take you away from here
I need a chance to catch my breath
I'm no longer the thing that can take away our fear

Put down, put down the loaded gun
Pointed straight between my eyes

Put down, put down the loaded gun
Pointed straight between my eyes
'Cause you can't fight fair tonight
With words that cut like knives

Put down, put down the loaded gun
Pointed straight between my eyes
'Cause you can't fight fair tonight
With words that cut like knives
