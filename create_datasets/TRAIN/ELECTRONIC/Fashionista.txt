Everybody line up
The show is about to start
Places, the show is about to start
You have to show a look
Have a look, or give a look

Faces, beautiful
No one ugly allowed
Are you ready? Here we go

Fashion is the art, designers are the gods
Models play the part of angels in the dark
Which one of you would ever dare to go against
That beauty is a trade and everyone is paid

LA, if you pay my way
