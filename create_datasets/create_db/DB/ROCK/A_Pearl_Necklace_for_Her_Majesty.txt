As your servant patronize me
Put my face inside of paintings
Blessed are the royal favorites
Blessed are the royal favorites
A pearl necklace for her majesty
You do not a thing for me,
Can't you see your king, that catholic?
Make me a martyr!
Make me a martyr!

Waiting for your king to disown you
I'm you fat traitor your majesty (majesty)
Waiting for the king to enthrone you
I'm your fat traitor your majesty (majesty)

As your vacant, move inside you
All your spacious things around you
Blessed are the royal favorites
Blessed are the royal favorites
A pearl necklace for her majesty,
You call and we come rushing,
Showered in these gifts and bracelets,
Make me a martyr!
I'll Die just another

Waiting for your king to disown you
I'm you fat traitor your majesty (majesty)
Waiting for the king to enthrone you
I'm your fat traitor your majesty (majesty)

(you're nothing when you're alone)
