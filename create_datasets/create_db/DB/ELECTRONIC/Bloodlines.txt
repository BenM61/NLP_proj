How did I make this choice?
Filling my heart up with rage.
No one can hear my voice.
The deafening shame

[Chorus]
I lay my life on the line.
I lost my soul to Bloodlines!

How can you live this way?
That's a good question.
I'm walking between the pain
Without redemption.

[Chorus]

What is it like to be hated
Inside a world with no control over time?
What is it like to be created
Inside a world where life is a crime?

[Chorus: x2]
