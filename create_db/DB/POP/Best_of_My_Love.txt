Doesn't take much to make me happy
And make me smile with glee
Never ever will I feel discouraged
'Cause our love's no mystery
Demonstrating love and affection
That you give so openly
I like the way you make me feel about you, baby
Want the whole wide world to see

Oh oh you've got the best of my love
Oh oh you've got the best of my love
Oh oh you've got the best of my love
Oh oh you've got the best of my love

You've got the best of my love

My love, my love
My love, my love
My love, my love
You've got the best of my love

Flowing in and out of changes
Oh, kind that come around each day
My life has a better meaning
Love has kissed me in a beautiful way

Oh, my love
Oh oh oh, my love, yeah

Oh oh you've got the best of my love
Oh oh you've got the best of my love
Oh oh you've got the best of my love
Oh oh you've got the best of my love

My love, my love
My love, my love
My love, my love
My love, my love
You've got the best of my love

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh my love, my love
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
You've got the best of my love

My love, my love
My love, my love
My love, my love
You've got the best of my love
