Soft as the starlight in the sky
Soft as the pillow on which I lie
Warm is the glow from the moon above
Warm is my heart that is filled with love

Love that only you can bring
Love as soft and warm as Spring
My heart knows the reason why
I feel soft as the starlit sky

Dreams become reality
Darling when you're near to me
So I'll dream of you and sigh
Soft as starlight in the sky

Love that only you can bring
Love as soft and warm as Spring
My heart knows the reason why
I feel soft as the starlit sky

Dreams become reality
Darling when you're near to me
So I'll dream of you and sigh
Soft as starlight in the sky

Soft as the starlight in the sky
