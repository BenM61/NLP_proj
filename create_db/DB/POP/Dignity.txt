You got the hottest shoes (you got it)
You got those Jimmy Choo's (you got it)
You never get the blues
It's always all about you (we got it, we got it)

Wake up late
No time to waste
Better check that phone
There's a club too close

Where's your, where's your, where's your dignity?
I think you lost it in the Hollywood Hills
Where's your, where's your, where's your dignity?
Can't buy respect, but you can pick up the bill
Pick it up, pick it up, so you got it, so you got it
Pick it up, pick it up 'cause money makes your world go 'round
(Money makes your world go round)

Always with Mr. Right (right now)
But then you have a fight (he's out)
Run into your friend's ex
He's happy to be your next (She won't mind, she won't mind)

Tomorrow's papers
Comin' out
So kiss him fast
Watch the cameras flash

Where's your, where's your, where's your dignity?
I think you lost it in the Hollywood Hills
Where's your, where's your, where's your dignity?
Can't buy respect, but you can pick up the bill
Pick it up, pick it up, so you got it, so you got it
Pick it up, pick it up 'cause money makes your world go 'round
(Money makes your world go round)

You'd show up to the opening of an envelope
Why!
Does everybody care about where you go?

It's not news when you got a new bag
It's not news when somebody slaps you
It's not news when you're lookin' your best
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, give it a rest

Pick it up, pick it up, so you got it, so you got it
Pick it up, pick it up 'cause money makes your world go 'round
Where's your, where's your, where's your,
Money makes your world go 'round
Where's your, where's your, where's your,
Cause money makes your world go 'round
Where's your, where's your, where's your,
Money makes your world go 'round
Where's your, where's your, where's your,
Cause money makes your world go 'round

Money makes your world go 'round!
