I couldn't speak so I slurred while I looked for a word
But you left just before I could find it
I sat by myself and I stared at the pictures of you on the wall

I kissed the floor, curled up in a ball
There's nothing coming out of my mouth so I said nothing at all

Babe, you've got a face like thunder
Always trying to get out and under
Just stay still 'til I say it's over
Babe, you've got a face like thunder

And you question your lover, did she really believe
That this new taste of love is obsolete?
It just couldn't compete and so you'll
Keep dragging your body through life by the hair
So you can say that you've been somewhere and you don't care
How you're received, you sense it's a debt then you can't be reprieved

Babe, you've got a face like thunder
Always trying to get out and under
Just stay still 'til I say it's over
Babe, you've got a face like thunder

Say sorry for what, for what, for what?
You know I didn't mean it
I said something terrible and I tried to redeem it
I can be so cool but now I don't seem it

Babe, you've got a face like thunder
Always trying to get out and under
Just stay still 'til I say it's over
Babe, you've got a face like thunder
