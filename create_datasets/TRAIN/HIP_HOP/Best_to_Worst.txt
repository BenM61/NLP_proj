featuring Peter Gunz 


I'm sending rappers to heaven 
so call me uplifting 
I greet ya defeat ya 
take all your recognition 
be in the ignition first gear 
I'm gone 
had the best to the worst confess my lyrics is strong 

Verse 1: Shaq  Peter Gunz 

I was born to raise hell and cause havoc when I enter 
have the pin back hands up white flag surrender 
what I'm into pulling stocks and bonds and cheddar 
gauaranteeing the world you can't find nuthin better 
so whatever 
bring it the front and put your money by your mouth 
find your teeth and cash coming out 
I bring drama to your momma if she want it 
you think I'm fronitin' a fruad 
Peter tell 'em how I want it 

aiyo Shaq the world is yours 
but can I get a city 
gritty blocks shitty cops 
broads with tingo bittys 
hit 50 in the ruckus mutha 
is I happy 
you callin me fraud but your broad's calling me daddy 
while you pumpin dollar bottles on the floor looking funny 
I'm going drop hits with Shaq kid 
and dirt getting money 
sunney days is made the pain it rains no more 
the cash will last from now the guns hits the floor 


Verse 2: Shaq 

check it 
Enrico dope like perscriptions from pharmacys 
injecting through speakers with no limit slash no mercy 
the ill beat seaker 
I mystify minds like I'm a preacher 
when I meet ya start convulsing like a seizure 
you best believe I got more tricks up my shirt sleeve 
expidisouly I get loose like hair weave 
which mc out there want to come test me 
put footprints in your chest like Kareem did me 
I run rhymes like drunk drivers on stop signs 
I change my name to Deon cause I'm mutha freaking prime time 


Verse 3: Peter Gunz 

out the alleys of the ghetto there echos a voice sweeter 
the melon a felon under the first name Peter 
looking out the hour glass what do I see 
Guliani with tacky at me with death penalty 
I dodge the cops bob and weave to the left 
young gifted and black but yet I'm still marked for death 
my breath and oxygen is limited 
they did me in with it 
they took my lungs my heart they kept my brain and headed with it 
I live alive to see my seed breath airs 
in and exhale but please breath clean air 
runnin 'round killin people with sex you flex 
spread in the bed ask me dread who's next
