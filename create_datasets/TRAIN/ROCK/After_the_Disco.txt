After your faith has let you down
I know you'll want to run around
And follow the crowd into the night
But after the disco
All of the shine just faded away
Oh oh oh oh
Do what you want
Do what you will
Don't tell me it's not our time

'Cause I'm
Waiting here much too long and
Don't assume
That I need your love
The chill of night has got you dancing away
And I'm
Not the dreamer or the dream you're
Out there looking for

How did I get in this winding maze of love?
And there's something wrong and it's sending you
Round and round 'til we go nowhere

I see the ashes on the ground
I know the world is burning down
And under the cold and empty moon
But after the disco
All of the shine just faded away
Oh oh oh oh
Do what you want
Do what you will
But you can't hide
Oh oh oh oh
Do what you want
Do what you will
Don't tell me it's not our time

'Cause I'm
Waiting here much too long and
Don't assume
That I need your love
The chill of night has got you dancing away
And I'm
Not the dreamer or the dream you're
Out there looking for

How did I get in this winding maze of love?
And there's something wrong and it's sending you
Round and round 'til we go nowhere
