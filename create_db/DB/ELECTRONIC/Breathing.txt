Outside 
Gets inside 
Through her skin
I've been out before 
But this time it's much safer in

Last night in the sky
Such a bright light
My radar send me danger 
But my instincts tell me to keep

Breathing
(Out, in, out, in, out, in)
Breathing
Breathing my mother in
Breathing my beloved in
Breathing
Breathing her nicotine
Breathing
Breathing the fall-out in
Out in, out in, out in, out in

We've lost our chance
We're the first and the last, ooh
After the blast
Chips of plutonium 
Are twinkling in every lung

I love my 
Beloved, ooh
All and everywhere
Only the fools blew it
You and me 
Knew life itself is

Breathing 
(Out, in, out, in, out, in)
Breathing
Breathing my mother in
Breathing my beloved in
Breathing 
Breathing her nicotine
Breathing
Breathing the fall-out in 
Out in, out in, out in, out in
Out in, out in, out in, out
(Out, out, out)

(What are we going to do without)
Ooh please! 
(What are we going to do without) 
Let me breathe! 
(What are we going to do without)
Ooh, breath in
(We are all going to die without)
Leave me something to breathe! 
(What are we going to do without)
Oh, leave me something to breathe! 
(We are all going to die without)
Oh, God, please leave us something to breathe! 
(What are we going to do without)
Oh, life is
