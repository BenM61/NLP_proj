Everything about is so right
Baby you know that I'm so proud
To say that your mine, all mine
Why you leaving like a fool
Is there something that I said or done to you? 

You know I wonder, oh I wonder
If you're coming home tonight
I'm thinking what it could of been baby
Can't get you off my mind
I've opened up the door
But in my heart...

Feel you running away from my love
Why you running away from my love
It's cold when we're apart
And it's playing in my heart
The moments that we shared will stay
In my heart, i...feel you

Thinking of the lovin' we made
Baby, I love the way you touch me in that special way
So why do I feel like a man that's being played
Tell me it isn't true (spoken)
I'm begging baby, stay

You got me going crazy
I've been waiting by the phone
I'm thinking about the things that I want to do to you
Soon as you get home
I give you everything
But in my heart i...

Feel you running away (yes I do) from my love
Why you running away from my love
It's cold when we're apart
And it's playing in my heart
The moments that we shared will stay
In my heart, i...feel you

You know I wonder, oh I wonder
If you're coming home tonight
I'm thinking of the bedroom baby
We'd be making love, making love
Ooh, if only you would come through the door
I know you can't ignore
All of the love you ever need I want to give you more

I feel you running away from my love (I really do feel it, can you feel it)
Why you running away from my love (I really do feel it, can you feel it)
Because it's cold when we're apart
And it's playing in my heart
