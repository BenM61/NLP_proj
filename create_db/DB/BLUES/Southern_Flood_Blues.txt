Early early one morning, water was comin' in my door
Early one morning, water was comin' in my door
It was the old high(?) river, tellin' us to get ready and go

It was dark and it was rainin', you could hear that howlin' wind
It was dark and it was rainin', baby you could hear that howlin' wind
If I get away this time, I will never come here again

Hey my baby was cryin', I didn't have a thing to eat
Hey hey hey, I didn't have a thing to eat
Hey the water had come in, wash everything I had down the street

I was hollerin' for mercy, and it weren't no boats around
Hey I was hollerin' for mercy, and it weren't no boats around
Hey that looks like people, I've gotta stay right here and drown

Hey my house started shakin', started floatin' on down the stream
Hey my house started shakin', went on floatin' on down the stream
It was dark as midnight, people began to holler and scream
