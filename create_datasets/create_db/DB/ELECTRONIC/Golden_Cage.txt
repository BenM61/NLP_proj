So you no longer care if there's another day
I guess I have been there, I guess I am there now
You knew what you wanted and you fought so hard
Just to find yourself sitting in a golden cage
In a golden cage

So of course I miss you and miss you bad
But I also felt this way when I was still with you
Yes of course I miss you and miss you bad
But I also felt this way when I was still with you

This city's no longer mine
There's sadness written on every corner
Each lover was made to sign
Now I hear them calling me over and over
