We move in numbers
Like shifting sand
But we're too eager
To understand
'Cause we're not ready
We're too proud

Now we're finding a different way
We've been chasin' each others tails
Now we're ridin' a new wave
All on our own way
More than a face in the crowd (a face in a crowd)

Hundreds of people
All runnin' 'round
But there's no color
And there's no sound
We move in silence
Looking down

Now we're finding a different way
We've been chasin' each others tails
Now we're ridin' a new wave
All on our own way
More than a face in the crowd

A face in a crowd

Now we're finding a different way 
We've been chasin' each other's tails 
Now we're ridin' a new wave 
All on our own way 
More than a face in the crowd (a face in a crowd) 

Na na na na na na na na-na na 
Na na na na na na na-Na
Na na na na Na

More than a face in the crowd

Na na na na na na na na-na na 
Na na na na na na na-Na
Na na na na Na

More than a face in the crowd
