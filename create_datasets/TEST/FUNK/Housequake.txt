Shut up already, damn!
Tell me who in this house know about the quake?
(We do)
I mean really, really
If you know how to rock say 'yeah' (yeah)
If you know how to party say 'oh yeah' (oh yeah)
But if you ain't hip to the rare house quake,
Shut up already, damn!

Housequake
Everybody jump up and down
Housequake
There's a brand new groove going round (housequake)

In your funky town (housequake)
And the kick drum is the fault
You gotta rock this mother, say (housequake)
We gotta rock this mother, say (housequake), unh unh

We're gonna show you what to do
You put your foot down on the two
You jump up on the one
Now you're having fun, huh

A little bit harder than they did in '66
A little bit faster than they did in '67
Twist little sister and go to heaven
