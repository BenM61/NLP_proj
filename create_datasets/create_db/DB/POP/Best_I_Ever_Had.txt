Melt Antarctica, savin' Africa
I failed algebra and I misused some times
We're at war again, save the world again
You can all join in, but you can't smoke inside

You said "Take me home, I can't stand this place
'Cause there's too many hipsters and I just can't relate"
You're my neon gypsy, my desert rain
You're my "Helter Skelter", oh how can I explain that

You're the best I ever had
And I'm trying not to get stuck in my head
But I read that soda kills you and Jesus saves
On the bathroom wall where I saw your name
You're the best I ever had
I won't be the same

Night sky full of drones, this neighborhood of clones
I'm looking at the crowd and they're staring at their phones
They groom the coast line here, the sun will disappear (Oh God!)
And maybe once a year, I think they'll clean my car

Caught my reflection, drop the call
I've been medicated with cigarettes and alcohol
I got vertigo, no I can't see straight
I got obligations though I'm usually late but

You're the best I ever had
And I'm trying not to get stuck in my head
But I think I dropped my wallet in Santa Fe
Lost the only picture I had of you that day and
You're the best I ever had
I won't be the same

Hey West Virginia, hey North Dakota
I think I love you, but don't even know you
Hey Massachusetts, hey Minnesota
I think I love you, but don't even know you
Hey Carolina, hey Oklahoma
I think I love you, but don't even know you
Hey Alabama, hey California
I think I love you, but don't even know you

You're the best I ever had (you're the best I ever had)
And I'm trying not to get stuck in my head
But I passed the longest sign on the interstate
Saying "Find someone before it gets too late"
You're the best I ever had (you're the best I ever had)
I won't be the same

Hey West Virginia, hey North Dakota (Oh why, oh why)
I think I love you, but don't even know you (I won't be the same)
Hey Massachusetts, hey Minnesota (you're the best I ever had)
I think I love you, but don't even know you (I won't be the same)

Yeah, I won't be the same
