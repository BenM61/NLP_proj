To every young man who can't pass
From every lipstick lezzie-lass
From every drag queen's high-heel stagger
To every bulldagger swagger
Do the Bulldagger
Bulldagger swagger
Do the Bulldagger
Bulldagger swagger
Do the bulldagger
Bulldagger swagger -
 yeah
I went to charm school I got a degree
And full-fleshed feminenergy
You know that I ain't trying to be a man
I'm just being who I am
And that's a very very very butch lesbian
(refrain)
I went to the lady's room I had to pee
Wow was everybody staring at me
A little girl giggled, a lady gazed
One woman nearly had a heartattack
(refrain)
(repeat 1st)
(repeat 1st)
(refrain)
