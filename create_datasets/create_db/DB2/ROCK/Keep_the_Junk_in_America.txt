I saw a light in the desert sky
Space station comin' down
I hope it don't fall on me
Twisted metal on the ground
I see pain in a young man's eyes
As he reaches for a fix
I see him shake when he's hangin' out
That's not what I call kicks

Keep the junk in America
Keep the junk in America
Keep that junk
Leave it where it belongs

I ate a burger and some fries
Mamma it made me so sick
They gave it to me with a smile
I know it was a trick
I heard some muzak on the radio
They play it every hour
I hear that garbage on the radio
And I sing it in the shower

Keep the junk in America
Keep the junk in America
Keep that junk
Leave it where it belongs

America she's got the best
She's also got the worst
But down here we get everything
Sometimes I think we're cursed
We gave them the boomerang
You know it just flew back
With stars and with stripes all over it
Radar on its track
There's a missile base just down the street
Where they fight the war
And when the rockets find it
I won't be here no more

Keep the junk in America
Keep the junk in America
Keep that junk
Leave it where it belongs
Keep the junk in America
Keep the junk in America
