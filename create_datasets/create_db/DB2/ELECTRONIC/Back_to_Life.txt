I've been looking for your love
But I couldn't find the way
Baby I've been such a fool
'Cause I want someone

Someone who just cares for me
And it's got to be with you
All the times I've tried before
Only feelings just for you

Waiting for your love so true 
Bless the day I'll find you
It's gonna change my world
I'm not living without you

Back to life to love
Back to life oh oh o
Back to life to love 
Back to life oh oh o

Oh oh oh oh oh o
Turning back to life
Walking back to life
Oh oh oh oh oh o
Turning back to life
To somethin' I can believe
