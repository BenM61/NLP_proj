Somebody told me
Once in a lifetime
Destiny finds you and blows you away
Spins you in circles
Pulls you in pieces
Bleeds you like Jesus
And goes on its way
But it's oh so simple sometimes
Just to lay your heart open wide
If you want to get to heaven
Then you gotta take the ride

Love lift me
Wherever you are
Convince me
I'm safe in your arms
Love lift me
Make sense of it all
Teach me to fly
And don't let me fall

Somebody told me
Love makes you stupid
Makes you go crazy
Makes you go blind
Comes uninvited
And leaves when it wants to
Calls you at midnight and ties up your line
But it's oh so sweet when it's right (There's nothin' better)
And you swear you won't but you might (You're gonna try)
Gotta fumble in the dark if you want to see the light

Love lift me
Wherever you are
Convince me
I'm safe in your arms
Love lift me
Make sense of it all
Teach me to fly
And don't let me fall

And when it's all said and done
It's just the same for everyone
You're busy making your plans
Love's like a bird baby
Flying out of your hands

And it's oh so hard to explain (We don't know nothin')
And your heart gets hold of your brain (But still we try)
Better batten down the hatches baby
Here we go again 

Love lift me
Wherever you are
Convince me
I'm safe in your arms
Love lift me

I'm waiting on you
Cause nothing can lift me
The way that you do
Love lift me
Love lift me
Love lift me (Only love can take me higher)
I want to fly
