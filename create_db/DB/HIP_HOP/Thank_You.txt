Tragedies are commonplace
All kinds of diseases, people are slipping away
Economies down, people don't get
Enough pay
But as for me all I can say is
Thank you Lord for all you done for me

Folks without homes are in the streets
And the drug habit some say
They just can't beat
Muggers and robbers, no place seems
To be safe
But you've been my protection every
Step of the way
And I want to say
Thank you Lord for all you've done
For me hey?

It could've been me
Thank you
Outdoors
Thank you
With no food
Thank you
And no clothes
Thank you
All left alone
Thank you
Without a friend
Thank you
Or just another number
Thank you
With a tragic end
Thank you
But you didn't see fit
Thank you
To let none of these things be
Thank you
You keep on, keeping on, keeping me
Thank you
I wanna say
Thank you Lord for all you've done for me

I wanna thank you for your love
Thank you for your power
Thank you for protection, every hour
Thank you
