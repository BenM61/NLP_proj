Right from the start, you were a thief
You stole my heart
And I your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me
That weren't all that pretty
And with every touch you fixed them

Now, you've been talking in your sleep
Oh oh, things you never say to me
Oh oh, tell me that you've had enough
Of our love, our love

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken
Just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

I'm sorry I don't understand where
All of this is coming from
I thought that we were fine
(Oh, we had everything)
Your head is running wild again
My dear, we still have everything
And it's all in your mind

You've been having real bad dreams
Oh oh, used to lie so close to me
Oh oh, there's nothing more than empty sheets
Between our love, our love

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

Oh, tear ducts and rust
I'll fix it for us
We're collecting dust
But our love's enough
You're holding it in
You're pouring a drink
No, nothing is as bad as it seems

Just give me a reason (a reason you give)
Just a little bit's enough (it'll be enough)
Just a second, we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars (it's in the stars)
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
