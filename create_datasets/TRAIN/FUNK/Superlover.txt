Night falls and I'm calling out your name
And you're right where I want you to be
Tears turns to stars in my eyes
And your love is an old mystery

Super lover, I wonder
Does every other lover in the world
Make each other feel the way you make me feel?

I think I'm going insane
You bring out the need in me
Never felt such joy or such pain
I know I ought to go but I just can not leave

Super lover, I wonder
Does every other lover in the world
Make each other feel the way you make me feel?

Never knew anybody like you
No one can move me like you do
Love on top of love
More love than I ever dreamed of

Baby, baby won't you touch me, hug me
Make me, make me, drive me crazy?

Super lover, I wonder
Does every other lover in the world
Make each other feel the way you make me feel?

Super lover, I wonder
Any other lover in the world
Make each other feel the way you make me feel?

Super lover, I wonder
Does every other lover in the world
