I know this girl named Denise
She makes me weak at the knees
She drives a lavender Lexus
She lives in Queens but her dad lives in Texas

(Sha la la la la la la)
When she holds me
(Sha la la la la la la)
I can't help myself
(Sha la la la la la la)
Won't you tell me
Do you love me Denise?
Whoa-oh
Do you love me Denise?
Oh baby tell me please
(Do ya do ya ah-oh do ya do ya)

I heard she used to be married
She listens to Puff Daddy
She works at Liberty Travel
She got a heart made of gravel

(Sha la la la la la la)
She controls me
(Sha la la la la la la)
She can't help herself
(Sha la la la la la la)
Won't you tell me
Do you love me Denise?
Whoa-oh
Do you love me Denise?
Oh baby tell me please
(Do ya do ya ah-oh do ya do ya)
