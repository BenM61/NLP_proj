I try in vain
To disconnect my brain
I don't know if I can handle it
Handle so much pain

I don't know what's left to gain
All the guilt and now the blame
I don't want to stop this game
I'm starting to enjoy the pain

I don't care what you claim
I still hear your voice replaying
The only thing that remains
Is to disconnect my brain

I try to disinfect
And sanitize my brain
Perhaps I won't be satisfied
Until I go insane

Disconnect
Disconnect 
Disconnect my brain
Disconnect 
Disconnect
Disconnect my pain
