What is there to do?
I'm sick and fucking tired of sitting on my ass
Staring at the headlines
Watching the world go by
I gotta find a way
To make it all make sense
I gotta find the reason
I gotta find out why...
Why I'm so fucked up
Life can be a pointless fucking mess sometimes
I can't help but wonder why
What's the goddamn point of trying
To do anything at all
You tell me things'll be better tomorrow

I have my fuckin doubts- oh yeah
But I'm gonna try
I'm gonna try
It's my only chance to escape it
Why can't people see that life is too short
To be wasted on a lost cause
Humanity is stupid
People can't see that we're destroying ourselves
I gotta find a way
To make it all make sense
I'm gonna find the reason
I'm gonna find out why...
Why I'm so fucked up
