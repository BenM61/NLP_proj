Have you heard the news that's goin' 'round here?
The man in charge has got to go
'Cause he dances 'round the problem, boy
And the problem is the man in charge you know

Now, the young knows what I'm talking 'bout
It's a con in the old man's game
The man in charge, he don't know what he's doing
He don't know the world has changed

Power seems to be so far up
The man on the street ain't got a clue
The high top cat's running your life
Thinks the problem is me and you

Born in a time that has gone by
The old tell the young what to do
Have you heard the news that's goin' 'round here?
The problem is the man in charge of you
The problem is the man in charge of you

Power seems to be so far up
The man on the street ain't got a clue
The high top cat's running your life
Thinks the problem is me and you

Have you heard the news that's goin' 'round here?
The man in charge has to go
The man in charge has got to go
Man in charge has to go
