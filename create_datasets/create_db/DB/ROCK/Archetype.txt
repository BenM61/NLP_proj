The essence of your spark.
All of that which defines you
Is the essence of you blood.

The infection has been removed,
The soul of this machine has improved.
The infection has been removed,
The soul of this machine has improved.

Look into my eyes
And tell me what you see.
Someone real, this is real,
What you wish to be.

You must never forget
To modernize performance.
Malignancies on the system
Will handicap, slow up and rust.

The infection has been removed,
The soul of this machine has improved.
The infection has been removed,
The soul of this machine has improved.

Look into my eyes
And tell me what you see.
Someone real, this is real,
What you wish to be.

F*ck!

Can you see?
Can you see?

Look into my eyes
And tell me what you see.
Someone real, this is real,
What you wish to be.

Open your eyes [open your eyes, open your eyes]
Open your eyes [open your eyes, open your eyes]
Open your eyes [open your eyes, open your eyes]
Open your eyes [open your eyes, open your eyes]
Open your eyes [open your eyes, open your eyes]
Open your eyes [open your eyes, open your eyes]
