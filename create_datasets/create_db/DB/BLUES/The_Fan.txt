Heard you got an infection 
Just before your lewd rejection 
Wait'll the shit hits the fan 
You couldn't turn him down 
Hold your address book above your knees 
And kissed your soft legs there 
He was on top of the pop stars 
You couldn't turn him down 
 
You were a sweet girl 
When you were a cheerleader 
But I think you're much better now 
 
Bought a few reds from your neighboorhood dealer 
And you passed out in the back of a car 
You were too messed up to climb out 
What if your old man had found out?
