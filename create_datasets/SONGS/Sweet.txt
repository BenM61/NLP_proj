Sunshine, takes me to a place where
I'm living free
Something in your eyes is telling me
This is where I want to be
But I never thought it would be
So warm

Sweet
Sweet
Sweet
Make me feel real

It's funny 
How it just gets sweeter and sweeter
Day by day
It's sweet how
You just get funnier 
To me in every way
But I never thought I would be
So warm

Sweet
Sweet
Sweet
Let me be me

Sweet
Sweet
Sweet
I can't believe you're real

It's so rare
To find someone
Who
Brings on the sunshine the way you do
It's so

Sweet
Sweet
Sweet
Make me feel real

Sweet
Sweet
Sweet
I can't believe you're real
