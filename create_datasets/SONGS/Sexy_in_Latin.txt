Well our mums got talkin' at the village store
I was three you were four
You looked lovely that's for sure
Just somethin' about you

Together we went everywhere
You scratched my face I pulled you hair
You sent me tumblin' down the stairs
Just somethin' about you

(Bridge)
You must have known that I want you (that I want you)
You must have known that I want you don't you

Something's happenin'
It's written on the wall that you're sexy in Latin
This time,come on
Everything's changin' we can't hold on.

Together we went everywhere
You scratched my face I pulled you hair
You sent me tumblin' down the stairs
Just somethin' about you

We'd stay out drinking in the park
I'd walk you home after dark
I didn't mind it wasn't far
Because there's somethin' about you

You went to university
You lost your virginity
Saw more of him and less of me
But there's somethin' about you

(Bridge)

Something's happenin'
It's written on the wall that you're sexy in Latin
This time,come on
Everything's changin' we can't hold on.

Together we went everywhere
You scratched my face I pulled you hair
You sent me tumblin' down the stairs
Just somethin' about you

Well we're not friends anymore
I'm twenty three, you're twenty four
You're still gorgeous that's for sure still somethin' about you

Now we've done it everywhere
You scratch my back, I pull your hair
We've even done it on the stairs
There's just somethin' about you.

Something's happenin'
It's written on the wall that you're sexy in Latin
This time,come on
Everything's changin' we can't hold on.
