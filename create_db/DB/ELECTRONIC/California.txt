Too many times I've dreamt about you
Seen too many days without the sun
'Cause I know it shines all the day through
And in too many ways, I miss the sun

So wait for me California
I gotta see my way to you

Too many times I've my heart ache
None of those times have I felt you

So far to go, but how it's worthwhile
Just get me back where I belong
Your local mountains of love of such style
And every day is like a song

So wait for me California
I gotta see my way to you

I need the kind of life you give me
It makes my love for you feel true

So wait for me California
I gotta see my way to you

I need the kind of life you give me
It makes my love for you feel true
