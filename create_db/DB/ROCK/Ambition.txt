You can take it or leave it as far as we're concerned
Because we're not concerned with you.
What you want is buried in the present tense
Blind alleyways allay the jewels".

I am a dried-up seed can't be restored
I hope no-one notices the sleep on me.
I've been walking along down this shallow slope
Looking for nothing particularly.

Am I guided or is this life for free
Because nothing ever seems to happen to me.
And I won't be tempted by vile evils
Because vile evils are vile evils...........
