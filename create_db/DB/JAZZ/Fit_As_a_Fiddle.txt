Fit as a fiddle and ready for love
I could jump over the moon up above
Fit as a fiddle and ready for love
Haven't a worry, I haven't a care
Feel like a feather that's floating on air
Fit as a fiddle and ready for love
Soon the church bells will be ringing
And I'll march with Ma and Pa
How those church bells will be ringing 
With a Hey, nonny, nonny and hotcha cha!
Hi diddle diddle, my baby's okay
Ask me a riddle, oh what did she say?
