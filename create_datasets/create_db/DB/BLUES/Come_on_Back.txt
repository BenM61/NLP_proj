It's about that time
Baby please don't go
I'd really wish you'd stay
'Cause I really love you so

And who is this man
That makes you feel
So much better
Than I make you feel

But if you ever return to me
And the love you find turns out not to be
Don't explain, girl, just let it go
There will be no, I told you so

Just come on back, I'll be right here
Just come on back, I"ll dry your tears
Baby, just come on back, I'll be right there
Come on back, babe, I'll dry your tears

And I'm not gonna find me a new love
Or make a brand new start
I might just die young
With a broken heart

'Cause if you ever return to me
And the love you find turns out not to be
Don't explain, girl, just let it go
I don't really want to know

All I want you to do is
Just come on back, I'll be right here
Just come on back, I"ll dry your tears
Baby, just come on back, I'll be right here
Come on back, babe, I"ll dry your tears

Just come on back, babe, I'll be right here
Come on back, I"ll dry your tears
Baby, just come on back, I'll be right here
Just come on back, I"ll dry your tears

Baby, just come on, just come on, just come on
Just come on, just come on, just come on back
I'll be back, just come on, just come on
Just come on back, just come on, just come on back

Yeah babe, just come on, just come on
Just come on, just come on back
Just come on, just come on
Just come on, just come on back

Baby, baby, just come on, just come on
[Incomprehensible] just come on, just come on back
[Incomprehensible] just come on, just come on
[Incomprehensible] just come on, just come on back
