As I am thinking 'bout my future,
And as I try to clear my mind.
I get these visions of my past life,
All these pictures passing by.

Now I am heading for tomorrow.
Maybe to lead another life,
A life in harmony, no sorrow,
And without selfishness or lies.

I got that feeling that nobody cares at all.
I got that feeling that I'm on my own.

I'm leaving for my world made of Chrystal,
It looks like snow and it's my paradise.
It's gleaming even when the sunlight is gone,
I call it "world of ice".

Now I am planning "world of glory",
What I shall do when I am there.
There won't be tears there won't be bad times,
'cause I'll be king and I will bear.

I got that feeling that nobody cares at all,
I got that feeling that I'm on my own.

I'm leaving for my world made of Chrystal,
It looks like snow and it's my paradise.
It's gleaming even when the sunlight is gone,
I call it "world of ice".
