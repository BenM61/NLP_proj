If I close my eyes, I'm afraid that
I won't make it through the night
Cause I never been this much in love

When I lay with you girl, I can't believe
That you're really here with me
Cause dreams never do come true with me, yes

How can I get down with someone like you
What's it all about, what I did, I do?
To deserve your love, yes, I'm not sure, what it was
But, I'm so glad you giving me your love

And I, I can't stop loving you, baby
(Baby, baby)
Oh

(Baby, baby)

(You're the one)
That I'll always love

If I ask myself, how I truly feel
There ain't nobody else
Can't lie you're the apple of my eye
Oh

It's not everyday that a man like me
Can find a girl like you
But I made a wish and it came true
Oh yes, yes, I did

How can I get down with someone like you?
What's it all about, what I did, I do?
To deserve your love, baby, I'm not sure, what it was
But, I'm so glad you giving me your love

And I, I can't stop loving you, baby
