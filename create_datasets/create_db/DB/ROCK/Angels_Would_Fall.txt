The rope that's wrapped around me 
Is cutting through my skin 
And the doubts that have surrounded me 
Are finding their way in 
I keep it close to me 
Like a holy man prays 
In my desperate hour 
It's better that way 

So I'll come by and see you again 
I'll be such a very good friend 
Have mercy on my soul 
I will never let you know 
Where my mind has been 

Angels never came down
There's no one here they want to hang around 
But if they knew 
If they knew you at all 
Then one by one the angels 
Angels would fall 

I've crept into your temple 
I have slept upon your pew 
I've dreamed of the divinity
Inside and out of you 
I want it more than truth 
I can taste it on my breath 
I would give my life just for a little death 

So I'll come by and see you again 
I'll be just a very good friend 
I will not look upon your face 
I will not touch upon your grace 
Your ecclesiastic skin 

I'll come by and see you again 
I'll have to be a very good friend 
If I whisper they will know 
I'll just turn around and go 
You will never know my sin
