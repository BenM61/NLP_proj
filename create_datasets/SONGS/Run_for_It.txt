Run For It (feat. Leigh Nash of Sixpence None The Richer)
I can't fight the fighter, I keep losing ground
and I can't hide the hider with you hanging around
I can't and I won't

You better run for your life, love, I'm walking I'm walking
You better run for your life, love, I'm walking I'm walking
I can't love a hater, its a losing game
Never love a quitter, you'll get left in the rain

I can't help the helper when my feet are bound
I can't feel you near me if you're not the only sound

You are, you're not
You better run for your life, love, I'm walking I'm walking
You better count up your reasons, I'm leaving I'm leaving
You better count up your reasons, I'm leaving I'm leaving
You better count up your reasons

I'm leaving I'm leaving
How do you like the way it feels when I leave you?
How do you like the way it feels when I leave you?
Leave you

You are, you're not
You better run for your life, love, I'm walking I'm walking
You better count up your reasons, I'm leaving I'm leaving
You better count up your reasons, I'm leaving I'm leaving
You better count up your reasons
