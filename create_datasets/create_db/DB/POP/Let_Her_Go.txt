Joe don't you know 
She is going away 
She told me today 
Still I believe 
She does not want to leave 
So take it from me 

We can't forget things we say 
I think about it every day 
She won't believe you anyway 
She's getting closer today 

Joe let her go 
Send your lover away 
Don't make her stay 
I know you see 
All that happens to her 
Happens to me 

We can't forget things we say 
I think about it every day 
She won't believe you anyway 
She's getting closer today
