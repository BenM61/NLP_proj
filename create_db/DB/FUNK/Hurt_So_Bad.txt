I know you don't know what I'm going through
Standing here looking at you

Well, let me tell you that it hurts so bad
It makes me feel so sad
Oh, it hurt so bad to see you again

Like needles and pins
People say, "You're making out okay
He's in love, don't get in their way"

Well, let me tell you that it hurts so bad
It makes me feel so sad
You're gonna hurt so bad if you walk away

Why can't you stay and let me make it up to you?
I'll do anything you want me to
You loved me before, come love me again
I can't let you go back to her

Please don't go, please don't go
Hurt, hurt so bad, it makes me feel so sad
It's gonna hurt so bad if you walk away

Please don't go, please don't go
Hurt, hurt so bad, you'll make it hurt so bad
It's gonna hurt so bad to see you again
