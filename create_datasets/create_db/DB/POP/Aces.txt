Keep your aces up your sleeve
When the temperature's rising
And the air's getting harder to breathe

And remember when to leave
Without leaving traces
Only a child leaves his footprints all around
Not caring if he's found out loud
And only a fool or a child shows his hand
Oh how I wish I was one of them again
One of them

Take your lovers as they come
Don't get too involved
Attachments are problems that can't be solved
And remember its a show
A ring with no net
And don't you forget no one will catch you when you fall
They've all got to cope with their own
Only a fool or a child bears his soul
Oh haw I thank them for giving me some hope
For giving me some

Keep your aces up your sleeve
And don't you forget no one will catch you when you fall
They've all got to cope with their own
And only a fool
Could see how much I love you
Good thing no one listens to him
Only a child or a fool shows his hand
Oh how I wish I was one of them
Either one of them again
