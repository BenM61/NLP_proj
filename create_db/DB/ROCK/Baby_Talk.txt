I am only five years old and my baby's three 
But I know that she's the girl just you wait and see 
When I say I love my girl, she replies to me, yeah

Dab oom dab oom dab dab oom dab oom dab dab dab 
Oom dab oom dab oom dab dab oom dab oom dab dab 
Which means to say she loves me 
In baby talk 
To say she loves me 
Dip di dip di dip

She cannot speak very well, everybody knows 
But to me she sure looks swell, in her baby clothes 
I asked her if her love is true and she only goes 
Yeah

Dab oom dab oom dab dab oom dab oom dab dab dab 
Oom dab oom dab oom dab dab oom dab oom dab dab 

Which means to say she loves me
I'll tell the world, that I love her so 
And if she wants to be my girl 
I'll never, (ever), ever let her go-o 

(Mmm hmm hmm oom dab oom dab oom dab dab) she will say to me 
When I kiss her on the cheek, oh so tenderly 
Although I'm only five years old, she is only three 
I really love my baby 
(Dip di dip di dip) 
Love my baby 
(Dip di dip di dip)
