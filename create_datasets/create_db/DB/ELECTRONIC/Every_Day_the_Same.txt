Everyday the same
Expression on my face
Me, myself I blame
This feeling out of place
On endless repetition
Never ending rain
Ending in depression
Dissatisfied again

Debut in the working world
Universal grinding wheel
Debut in the working world
Are you ready, are you ready now

I could be mistaken
Could it be I could be wrong
Lord it was never my intention
To be troubled for so long
And where in the world would I be now
And would I be a better man
Or nothing, not to no-one
Well I'd be just no good at all

Debut in the working world
Universal grinding wheel
Debut in the working world
Are you ready, are you ready to be loved
Right now?

Now every step I take
In transition I remain
Is it me, myself I make
And only I can change
This feeling inside of indifference
I will not tolerate
Making it my business
So much to love and hate
