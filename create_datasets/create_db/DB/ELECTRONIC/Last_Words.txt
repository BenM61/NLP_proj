Over Elkin Avenue
The helium balloon, disappears into the sky
You give some money to a junkie
Watch as the sunny day drifts by
Can't tell you why
You said you loved me
And I kind of believe that
But these days who knows what it means
So we sat by the laundry Matt with magazines and cigarettes
Talked about a million other things
These are the last words
I'll say to you
These are the last words
I'll say to you

I never saw the world the way the city looks me to today
I never thought the end would come this way
These are the last words
I'll say to you
Last night I dreamed that somebody had died
And it was one of us
I did the biggest thing that I could
But I was not enough
These are the last words
I will say to you
