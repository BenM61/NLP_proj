Baby's in the parlour waiting for the rain 
Beating like a hammer washing out her pain 
Clearing like the one seven years ago 
When her first big love melted like the snow 
Back then she doubted, if she would ever find a man 
Who could love her that way the same way again 
And just when she thought she's living in vain 
The man of her dreams came like the rain 

When love is the price freedom is the cost 
Love is the price freedom is the cost 
And just when you think everything is lost 
Love will be your price 
And I'll know, I would not change a thing 
Cause I know I would not change a thing 

They spoke about her dreams 
They spoke about love 
They spoke about all the things she was so afraid of 
He had a key-word for everything she felt 
So it didn't take long till' he got her nailed 
Pin ones hope on someones elses life 
And all your dreams will hurt you like a knife 
The same whit her she soon got lost 
When love is the price freedom is the cost 

She didn't trust that very first man 
To come to her life trying' to understand 
What nobody ever could before 
He only made her see there is something more 
To learn about freedom to free about love 
To handle all the things she was so afraid of 
To always follow what she really felt inside 
Everything else is like a roller coasters ride
