Keep thinking 'bout his angeleyes
I keep thinking,

Last night I was taking a walk along the river
And I saw him together with a young girl
And the look that he gave her made me shiver
'Cause he always used to look at me that way
Then I thought maybe I should walk right up to her and say
Ah-ha-ha, it's a game he likes to play

Look into his angeleyes
One look and you're hypnotized
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angeleyes
Oh no no no no

Ah-ha-ha, keep thinking 'bout his angeleyes
I keep thinking

Sometimes when I'm lonely I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember all the good times
When I thought I could never live without him
And I wonder does it have to be the same
Every time when I see him, will it bring back all the pain?
Ah-ha-ha, how can I forget that name?

Look into his angeleyes
One look and you're hypnotized
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angeleyes
Crazy 'bout his angeleyes
Angeleyes
He took my heart and now I pay the price
Look into his angeleyes
You'll think you're in paradise
Then one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angeleyes
Oh no no no no

Keep thinking,
Keep thinking 'bout his angeleyes
Keep thinking,
Keep thinking, I had to pay the price
