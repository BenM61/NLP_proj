Say what? Well come again
Do you think you can change it
It's just a matter of time 'til it all will end
I'm a wreck, and so are you
We're all wrecked up
I got a date with the devil and so do you

Will our bad luck even turn I doubt it man
I think we're destined to burn alive, yeah
We have lost
But you refuse to realize it at all cost
And the futures now
Isn't that tomorrow?
How can a man be so blind to see a wreck
Is the only way. I'm a wreck!

Say what. Yeah, well come again
Do you think you can change it?
It's just a matter of time 'til it all will end
I'm a wreck - and we're all dead
We're all wrecked up
I'll be rockin' and rollin' in hell instead!

So put on a smile and I'll light the ignition
This is real time, it ain't cinemavision
And yeah, the time's right now it will never be tomorrow
So don't ask how I can fit six billion in my car
Drive it off a cliff
Go out like a dinosaur
Here I am balanced on the edge
And it makes me fucking scared!
