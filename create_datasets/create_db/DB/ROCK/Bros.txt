Shake your hair, have some fun
Forget our mothers and past lovers, forget everyone
Oh, I'm so lucky, you are my best friend
Oh, there's no one, there's no one that knows me like you do

Remember when we cut our hair
Both looked like boys
But we didn't care
Stick it out together like we always do
Oh, there's no one, there's no one quite like you

Oh
Jump that 43
Are you wild like me
Raised by wolves and other beasts
I tell you all the time
I'm not mad
You tell me all the time
I got plans

Oh
Jump that 43
Are you wild like me
Raised by wolves and other beasts
I tell you all the time
I'm not mad
You tell me all the time
I got plans

Me and you
Me and you
Me and you
We could do better, I'm quite sure
Me and you
Me and you
Me and you
We could do better, I'm quite sure

Me me me, me me and you
Me me me, me me and you
