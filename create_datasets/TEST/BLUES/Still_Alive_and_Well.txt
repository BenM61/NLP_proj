Did you ever look to see who is left around?
When I think about the past it only brings me down

Everyone I thought was cool is six feet under ground
Make love in the grass while the sun is shining down

They tried to get me lots of times and now they're
It feels so good your long blond hair baby

Coming after you I got out and I'm here to say
When you're down low make me shake make the whole earth quake

Baby you can get out to I'm Still alive and well
So everyone will know

I'm still alive and well
I'm still alive and well every now and then its kind of hard
To tell I'm still alive and well
