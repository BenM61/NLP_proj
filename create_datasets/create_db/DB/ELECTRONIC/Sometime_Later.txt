Touch my hand
It's only me, listen
I'm here.

Come to stand
In sultry fields
With you.

And now
Old dummy day
I know
Is over this way.

I'm laughing
Saw you gonna kiss me
You see
Yeah as I said.

One day she won't
A lonely bird
Alone.

Judgment day
Saw the world it's gone
Unheard.

Sold the sea
A lot how it feels to me.

I hate the word it's sad to see
I take your weight
And your heart fades away
Today a renegade
To lay in woods
By the pheasants.

I mean it
You don't
Force on my head
Kill our nightmare.

A lonely bird, a lonely bird
A lonely bird, a lonely bird
A lonely bird, alone.

Color me
Cover me in the color that reminds you
Solemnly.

Could make the same mistake
And you would never know
That I am, that I am
Alone, now.

Something, something
Tells me that you
Have something
On, all of us now
You're heaven
Taking over me now
Color me hate
Raw little nerve
Color me and pull us
Only home
Me home.

Hold the sun down
Hold the sun down
Hold the moon down
Leave me to rest
Want the world man
Too the words out
Only relief is
To slip through the nets
Hold a minute
And stop a minute
And go, oh oh
Hold a minute
You said to me
Said to me and
Breath, breath, breath, breath, breath 
You said it to me
Sometime later.
