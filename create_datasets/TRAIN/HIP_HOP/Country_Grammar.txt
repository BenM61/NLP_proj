Hmm, I'm going down down baby yo street in a Range Rover
Street Sweeper baby cocked ready to let it go
Shimmy Shimmy cocoa wha' listen to it now
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

You can find me, in St. Louis rollin' on dubs
Smoking dubs in clubs, blowin' up like cocoa puff
sippin' Bud, gettin' perved and getting dubbed
Daps and hugs, mean mugs and shoulder shrugs
And it's all because, accumulated enough stretch
Just to navigate it, fully decorated on chrome
And it's candy painted, fans fainted
While I'm entertaining, wild ain't it
How me and mugs, I hang with Hannibal Lector (Hot Shit)
So feel me when I bring it, sing it loud wha
I'm from the Loop and I'm proud
Run a mile for the cause
I'm righteous above the law
Playa my style's raw
I'm "Born to Mack" like Todd Shaw
Forget the fame, and the glamor
Give me D's wit a rubber hammer
My grammar B's ebonics, gin tonic and chronic
F*ck bionic it's ironic, slammin' niggas like Onyx
Lunatics til the day I die
I run more game then the Bulls and Sonics

Hmm, I'm going down down baby yo street in a Range Rover
Street Sweeper baby cocked ready to let it go
Shimmy Shimmy cocoa wha' listen to it now

Foul niggas, run in the club and bust in the crowd nigga
How nigga, ask me again it's going down nigga
Now nigga, come to the circus and watch me clown nigga
Pound nigga, what you be givin' when I'm around nigga
Frown niggas, talkin' shit when I leave the town nigga

Hey I'm, ready to cut you up any day now
Play by, my rules boo and you gon' stay high
May I, answer yo third question like hey I
Say hi, to my niggas left in the slamma'
From St. Louis to Memphis
From Texas back up to Indiana, Chi-Town

L-A, New York Yankee niggas to Hotlanta, Louisiana
All my niggas wit Country Grammar
Smokin' blunts in Savannah
Blow thirty mill like I'm Hammer

Let's show these cats to make these milli-ons

Through you-City back up to Kingsland, wit nice niggas
Sheist niggas, who snatch yo life nigga, trife niggas
Who produce and sell the same beat twice, nigga, ice nigga
All over close to never sober
From broke to havin dough, 'cause my price Range is Rover

Seein now, through the pen I make my ends now
