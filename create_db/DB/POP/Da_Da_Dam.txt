Peter is smart, he knows each European country by heart
He likes to sit under an apple tree on his yard
And wait for an apple to fall

When Peter is nine
His teacher tells him that this planet is dying
That someone needs to put an end to it all
And so when Peter comes home
He tells his mom

I'm going out in the world to save our planet
And I ain't comin back until she's saved
I'll walk my way to see the King and parliament
If they don't help I'll do it by myself

I don't wanna be
Da da dam, anekatips da da dam
Da da da da da da, da da dam

Peter is young
He tries to talk but no one listens to him
Everybody's busy living and dying
Not thinking bout what they're doing

But look at the boy who

Went out in the world to save our planet

And he ain't coming back until she's saved
He walked his way to see the King and parliament
But they all turned their heads and walked away

Singin'

Da da dam, da da dam
Da da da da da da, da da dam

And now I'm going out in the world to save our planet
And I ain't comin' back until she's saved
I'm walkin' in the footsteps that young Peter made
And everybody is welcome to join
And sing with me

Da da dam, da da dam
Da da da da da da, da da dam
