West Endicott lies over the hill
And that's what it's all about
My friend introduced me to a girl from Newark Valley
And that's why I'm goin' out
Her hair was golden brown and she wore blue jeans
And she told me that she cried a lot
I told her not to worry 'bout the little things
Our conversation started gettin' hot

Let's make a wish
On this chromium dish
Our love will never end, never end
October nights and big city lights
Will never tear us apart
I can still feel it in my heart

Every night I wake up and I see your face
And your smile still tears me apart
The sound of your voice
Poundin' in my brain
I just can't find an easy way out
The girl from Newark Valley nearly stole my brain 
I say man she really knocked me out
West Endicott lies over the hill
And that's what it's all about

Let's make a wish on this chromium dish
Our love will never end, never end
October nights and big city lights
Will never tear us apart
I can still feel it in my heart
Darkness overfalls
And the wind picks up a chill
I justify my life by the girl that's in my life
October nights and big city lights 
Will never tear us apart
I can still feel it in my heart

Every Friday night I walk over the hill
I try to get to my girlfriend's house (X3)
