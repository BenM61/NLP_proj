Turn down the lights, turn up the radio
There's a fire in your eyes and it's keepin' me warm
Hold on to me like it was yesterday
When we both felt our spirits collide

I remember the moment, bein' struck down by lightnin'
Since the first time I saw your face and you smiled
Come and lay down with me, feel the space that's between us
Find the magic that keeps love alive

This time can be like the first time
Close your eyes and soon we'll be there
And no mind could ever guess what we're feelin'
Turn a spark to a flame, make a wish
Close your eyes, watch it start all over again
Just like the first time that you touched my skin
(All over again)
I tasted heaven, take me there again
(All over again)
Your smile, your touch, your taste
It turns me on and on and on
Then I fall in love with you all over again

Come and step through the stars
Take a ride through the universe
As long as we're here, let's take the whole thing in
What I'm tryin' to say is that you are so beautiful
Let me say it all over again

This time can be like the first time
Close your eyes, pretty soon we'll be there
And no mind could ever guess what we're feelin'
Turn a spark to a flame, make a wish
Close your eyes, watch it start all over again
Just like the first time that you touched my skin
(All over again)
I tasted heaven, take me there again
(All over again)
Your smile, your touch, your taste
It turns me on and on and on
Then I fall in love with you
All over again

All over again

All over again
