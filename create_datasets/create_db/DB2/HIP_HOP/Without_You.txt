There's no one who could ever love me like you loved me 
I remember how it used to be 
There was no stronger love 
And now I can't believe I was only too blind to see 
That your love is inside of me 
And now I don't have anything at all 
Every night I think as time just passes by 
Why I left your love and how it made me cry 
Now that I found out, don't know what to do 
My life feels so empty, so empty alone without you 

Without you, without you 
I don't know what I'll do without you girl 
Without you my love is in your hands 
There's nothing left to live for 
There's nothing left to do without you 

Every night I sleep, I sleep with a fantasy 
That your here, its just you and me 
Just like it always was 
But then I'm left to see that it was only a memory 
And what's left is for me to be alone without your love 
Every night I think as time just passes by 
Why I left your love and how it made me cry 
Now that I found out, don't know what to do 
My life feels so empty, so empty alone without you 

Without you, without you 
I don't know what I'll do without you girl 
Without you my love is in your hands 
There's nothing left to live for 
There's nothing left to do without you 

Without you, without you 
I don't know what I'll do without you girl 
Without you my love is in your hands 
There's nothing left to live for 
There's nothing left to do without you 

Without you, without you 
I don't know what I'll do without you girl 
Without you my love is in your hands 
There's nothing left to live for 
There's nothing left to do without you
