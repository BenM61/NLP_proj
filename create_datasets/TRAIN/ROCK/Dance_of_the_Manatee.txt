Take a little dive into the shallow and spy; what do you see?
You see the tortoise and the hare in a rat-race
And it fits like a glove under my sleeve; just wait till then
Their heads are the heaviest in operation
He's still not lost imagination
You can hear him mouth the whole ending; just wait till then

We Marys had ourselves a ball
Oh yes, we did
We Marys had ourselves a ball
I must admit

Hang us those limbs; hold no virtue
Those told to hold: project on my cue
Till we fall

Whether a he or a she, put your mouth where your money is
And are the birds of a feather that clever?
If I knew, I'd keep flocks, that's a given; just wait till then
Their heads cast shadows like skyscrapers
Still small enough to fit up their asses
To put it all into perspective with definition

We Marys had ourselves a ball
Oh yes, we did
We Marys had ourselves a ball
I must admit

Hang us those limbs; hold no virtue
Those told to hold: project on my cue

Oh, take a gander; the bigger they are, the harder they fall
Oh, take a gander; the bigger they are, the harder they fall
Not needy you'll see, not needy
And I close with open arms over trees
Not needy you'll see
Not needy you'll see, not needy
And I close with open arms over trees
Not needy you'll see
Not needy you'll see, not needy
And I close with open arms over trees
Not needy you'll see
Not needy you'll see, not needy
And I close with open arms over trees

Listen to proven guarantees while you're rolling up the sleeves, beatin' on the chest
But we can keep it in a jar when it's comin' cats and dogs for days
And we Marys had ourselves a ball
And I guarantee that what they've done for you they've done for me, they've done for me

Hang us those limbs; hold no virtue
Those told to hold: project on my cue
Hang us those limbs; hold no virtue
Those told to hold: project on my cue
