Everybody loves a star
When he's on the top
But no one ever comes around
When he starts to drop

But you were someone special
You stuck through thick and thin
But I was much too busy
Trying to shine
To let your love shine in

Let you slip away
I must have been insane
Stop in the name of love
Don't make me live my life in vain

Give me one more chance
That's all I ask of you
Just one more chance
I'll make it up to you
Just one more chance
That's all I ask of you
I'll build a world for two
I'll make it up to you

Now since I'm all alone (since I'm all alone)
I'm talking to myself (talking to myself)
I know you're out there somewhere
Having fun with someone else

But a distant voice of hope
Echo from within, sayin'
(Don't give up)
(Your ship is comin' in)

Though my ship's alone
I'll play right to the end
I'm crying outside heaven's door
Won't you let me back in

Give me one more chance
That's all I ask of you
Just one more chance
I'll make it up to you
One more chance
That's all I ask of you
I'll build a world for two
I'll make it up to you

You'll never know
What I've been through
Let your love shine in again
This time I'll shine with you

One more chance
That's all I ask of you
Just one more chance
I'll make it up to you
One more chance
That's all I ask of you
I'll build a world for two
I'll make it up to you

One more chance
That's all I ask of you
Just one more chance
I'll make it up to you

One more chance
That's all I ask of you
I'll build a world for two
I'll make it up to you

One more chance
That's all I ask of you
I'll make it up to you
I'll build a world for two
