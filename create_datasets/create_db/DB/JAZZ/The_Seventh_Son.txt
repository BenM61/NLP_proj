Everybody's talking about the seventh son 
In the whole wide world there is only one 

And I'm the one, I'm the one 
I'm the one, I'm the one 
The one they call the seventh son 

I can tell your future, it will come to pass 
I can do things to you make your heart feel glad 
Look in the sky, predict the rain 
Tell when a woman's got another man 

I'm the one, oh I'm the one 
I'm the one, I'm the one 
The one they call the seventh son 

I can talk these words that will sound so sweet 
They will even make your little heart skip a beat 
Heal the sick, raise the dead 
Make the little girls talk out of their heads 

I'm the one, oh I'm the one 
I'm the one, I'm the one 
The one they call the seventh son 

I can talk these words that will sound so sweet 
They will even make your little heart skip a beat 
Heal the sick, raise the dead 
And make the little girls talk out of their heads 

I'm the one, oh I'm the one 
I'm the one, I'm the one 
The one they call the seventh son 

I'm the one, hey, hey 
I'm the one 
Oh, I'm the one, babe 
Oooo, I'm the one 
I'm the one, I'm the one 
The one they call the seventh son 
I'm the one, I'm the one 
The one they call the seventh son
