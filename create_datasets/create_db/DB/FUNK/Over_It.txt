I'm over your lies
And I'm over your games
I'm over you asking me
When you know I'm not okay
You call me at night
And I pick up the phone
And though you be tellin' me
I know you're not alone

Oh, and that's why your eyes
I'm over it
Your smile
I'm over it
Realized
I'm over it
I'm over it
I'm over

Wanting you to be wanting me
No, that ain't no way to be
How I feel
Read my lips
Because I'm so over
(I'm so over it)
Movin' on and it's my time
You never were a friend of mine
Hurt at first, a little bit
But now I'm so over
I'm so over it

I'm over your hands
And I'm over your mouth
Trying to drag me down and fill me with self doubt

Oh, and that's why your world
I'm over it
So sure
I'm over it
I'm not your girl
I'm over it
I'm over it
I'm over

Wanting you to be wanting me
No, that ain't no way to be
How I feel
Read my lips
Because I'm so over
(I'm so over it)
Movin' on and it's my time
You never were a friend of mine
Hurt at first, a little bit
But now I'm so over
I'm so over it

(Oh) don't call, don't come by
Ain't no use
Don't ask me why
You'll never change
There'll be no more crying in the rain
No, oh oh
I'm over it

Wanting you to be wanting me
No, that ain't no way to be
How I feel
Read my lips
Because I'm so over
(I'm so over it)
Movin' on and it's my time
You never were a friend of mine
Hurt at first, a little bit
But now I'm so over
I'm so over it

Wanting you to be wanting me
No, that ain't no way to be
How I feel
Read my lips
Because I'm so over
(I'm so over it)
Movin' on and it's my time
You never were a friend of mine
Hurt at first, a little bit
But now I'm so over
I'm so over it
