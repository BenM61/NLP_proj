Here I am the remains of me
My eyes tired but I can't sleep
My muscles withers
The weakness sows it's seed
God I ask you for your meaning of this
Can't you see what has become of my
Can't you see the tears I cry in horror
As last my eyes are closed and I am breathing slowly
Hoping again that this is the end
And I am on my way to embrace the holy

Look me in the eyes
What have you found in me 

A dark discovery

In my dreams I try to hide away
But there is no shelter to find
And I try to reach to the light of the day
I rage against the dying of the light 
God was I wish that I was all alone
Oh god all the ones that I learned to know
Think about those who I leave in sorrow
It is not fair why do I have to go

Please I beg you
To take away my pain

The dark discovery
What have you found in me
The dark discovery
The dark discovery

(Solo: Englund)

We all have to die eventually
But of course I didn't want to die
I wasn't old or infirm or in bad health
But most of all I didn't want to leave
My darling wife and my young son 
Who now has no father to look after him
And that is my greatest regret
