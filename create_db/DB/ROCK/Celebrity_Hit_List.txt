I gambled with my house when I lost my car
I gambled with my car trying to win back my wife
I lost my family on a sure fire thing
Then I lost against the odds when I gambled with my life
Now I'm on a list I'm on a list
The celebrity hit list
Another target out on the market
The celebrity hit list

I had a decent house I had a fancy car
I need a fancy car to drive my fancy wife
I had a family as a sure fire thing
I'd won against the odds first prize a nice life

Now I'm on a list I'm on a list
The celebrity hit list
Another target out on the market
The celebrity hit list

And when I fly I always fly at least as high as the sky
And when I fall I always fall at least as hard as you all

Now I'm on a list I'm on a list
The celebrity hit list
Another target out on the market
The celebrity hit list x2

And when I fly I always fly at least as high as the sky
'cause when I fly I always fly
