I remember when you told me
Do what you want
Do what you want, baby
I can't get you out of my head
You're everywhere and everyone

I'm calling the world
Calling everyone
I'm calling the world
Calling everyone
For you, for you

Then you ran off in a hurry
Where did you go?
I haven't seen you since Friday
I've been wastin' all of my time
Worrying about you everyday

I'm calling the world
Calling everyone
I'm calling the world
Calling everyone
For you, for you

I called your best friend
And your little brother
But they didn't want to talk
They said you changed your locks
I called every number in the phonebook
But everybody lied
They said you wanna, you wanna hide

Calling the world
Calling everyone

I'm calling the world
Calling everyone (x3)

For you, for you

I'm calling the world (x3)

For you, for you
