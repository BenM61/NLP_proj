I don't have a lot, but with me that's fine
Whatever I got, well, I know it's mine
I don't go around with the local crowd
I don't dig what's in so I guess I'm out
I'm saying these things
So you know me, baby
So, you understand what I'm all about

The boat that I row won't cross no ocean
The boat that I row won't get me there soon
But I got the love and if you got the notion
The boat that I row's big enough for two
Just me and you

There ain't a man alive
Can tell me what to say
I choose my own side and I like it that way
I don't worry about all the things that I'm not
There's only one thing that I want I ain't got
You know that I'm talkin' about you, baby
But you better know before you come along

The boat that I row won't cross no ocean
The boat that I row won't get me there soon
But I got the love and if you got the notion
The boat that I row's big enough for two
Just me and you

I'm saying these things
So you know me, baby
Do you understand what I'm all about
The boat that I row won't cross no ocean
The boat that I row won't get me there soon
But I got the love and if you got the notion
The boat that I row's big enough for two
Just me and you

The boat that I row won't cross no ocean
The boat that I row won't get me there soon
But I got the love and if you got the notion
The boat that I row's big enough for two
