I'm not your killer, I'm your knight in shining armor!
All of these games you play, and all this bullshit drama!
I betray to believe and find my breath in waste!
You think I'm tired? Well I'm not alone tonight!

Our love was a waste, this much is true.
I pray I'd forget you!

Yeah!
F*ck you!

You're no better than anyone,
You always think you have to own it.
Your jealousy won't cover me!
Why are you so helpless?

Open up you eyes and you'll see,
That I'm not perfect,
That's what I'm trying to be.

Open up your eyes and you'll see,
That I'm not perfect,
That's what I'm trying to be,
'Cause I know you're worth it.
These new demons are changing me inside,
Changing me inside.

Knock me down to pick yourself back up,
Because you hit the dust.
In your heart you're still nothing;
Always sinking down!

I bet you put yourself through Hell.
You did this to yourself.
I can't believe I wish you well.
I wish you well!

Knock me down to pick yourself back up,
Because you hit the dust.
In your heart you're still nothing;
Always sinking down!

Open up your eyes and you'll see,
That I'm not perfect,
That's what I'm trying to be,
'Cause I know you're worth it.
These new demons are changing me inside,
Changing me inside.

These new demons,
They're eating me alive.
Pushing and pulling,
The horror from inside.

If I can't have you,
Then nobody else can,
No!

Just the thought of you,
Walking hand in hand,
With somebody else,
With all the things we do,
Thought we'd never end,
'Till the love ran out of air.

If I can't have you,
Then nobody else can
