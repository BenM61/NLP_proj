Love is weird, love
She's overdone it, can't go on
She caused it all, cry, cry wolf
She didn't know, she didn't want it
She does a lot of things and regrets it
Love can hurt, love
Love is weird, love

A girl who wants it, but has no clue
She's says she'll give it, cry, cry wolf
A change of mind in a back seat or that dirty room
They say she got just what she wanted
Love can be bad
Love is weird, love

You should of known better
You should of known better
You should of known, It's all your fault
You should of known better
You should know better

Didn't they tell you
Didn't they tell you
Cry, cry wolf [Repeats]
