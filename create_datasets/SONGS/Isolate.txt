I'm sent for elimination
To where I cannot know, but I'm lost without a chance in hell
And I'm lost with doubts I can avoid this come feel the fire burn I'll slowly drift away
A victim of the future my mind and soul decayed

Isolate

I'm sent for eradication
By whom I cannot know, but I'm lost without a chance in hell
I'm the last one out I can't avoid this

Exposed to fire but I'll burn another way
A victim of the future I embrace the tourniquet

Isolate

Lead us all to pastures green
To search and learn
From ones I cannot be

Lead us all to harmony
To search and learn
The one I cannot be
