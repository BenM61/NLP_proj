Just say goodbye to little Jo
Just turn her loose now let her go
And she???ll be leaving while the sun goes down
She doesn???t love ya anymore

Sometimes it???s worth it to talk
Some wounds are easy to heal
Sometimes it???s all in your mind
Uh, but this time it???s big and it???s real

Gold turning back into night
This time you can???t make her stay
Don???t try to block her in pain
Or don???t try to stand in her way

Just say goodbye to little Jo
Just turn her loose now let her go
And she???ll be leaving while the sun goes down
She doesn???t love ya anymore

She tried to take ya somewhere
Somewhere you needed to be
Ya howl and ya curse at the gate
Til she tried to give you the key

You got no right to her love
You with your bloody hot brain
Aw, don???t try to suck her back in
No one could make her remain

Just say goodbye to little Jo
Just turn her loose now let her go
She???ll be leaving ya while the sun goes down
She doesn???t love you anymore

Say goodbye she???s gonna let it all unwind
Say goodbye she???ll la-la-leave it all behind
She???s meant to be gone let her leave without fighting
Rollin away down the line

You???ve shown so much of your hate
She???s seen so much of your greed
She???s taken shit for so long, yes, yes
That you ain???t got nothin she needs

You don???t deserve her no how
Go fading back into fate
Go sit ya down where ya were
Don???t grab and beg it???s too late

Just say goodbye to little Jo
Just turn her loose man, let her go
She???ll be leaving while the sun goes down
She doesn???t love you anymore
She doesn???t love ya anymore
She doesn???t love ya anymore
She doesn???t love you anymore
