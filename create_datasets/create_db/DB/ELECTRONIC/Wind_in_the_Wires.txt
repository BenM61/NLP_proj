Wind in the wires 
It's the sigh of wild electricity 
I'm on the edge of a cliff 
Surpassing 
Comfort and security 

But here comes a gale 
A crippling anger 
Sea birds are blown 
Into the rocks 
Grace is lost to thunder 

Thunder 
Pressure 
Getting 
Lower 

But see her waters break 
Rain falling to the sea 
Into a granite wave 

A unit 
A family 

It's just a sigh 
Just a sigh 

This wild electricity 
Made static by industry 
Like a bird in an aviary 
Singing to the sky 
Just singing to be free 

To be free
