Go head from the top!
Yeah. Ye!
Turn my music up (Ha)
Is you all with me?
You know, I can feel your presence
Come closer
Yeah

You turn me on
You flip the switch
I feel the current
Pushing me, pulling me
Close to you
Shocks in my system
There's an attraction
Look how I'm acting
Hard for me to keep my cool
 
Vibrations
Feel it in my chest! (feel that? ha ha)
When we touch
There's a charge I get!
(uh, you feel that? I feel that)
There is an energy
That I just can't control (It's electric)
When it takes over me
I let myself go!
(It's electric, oh, so, so electric)

Let's start some static
A bit of friction
Feel so magnetic
Pulling me more into you! Ho!
I got you open
The waves are flowing
So now you're glowing
I knew you were feeling me too!

Vibrations
Feel it in my chest! (ah, you feel that?)
When we touch
There's a charge I get! Woo!!
There is an energy (energy)
That I just can't control (Oh, oh)
When it takes over me (Over me, oh)
I let myself go!
(It's electric, oh, so, so electric)

It lives inside of me (alright)
A separate (ye!) entity
I can hear its heartbeat!
It's electric, It's electric, It's electric!!
Woo!

There is an energy (energy!!)
That I just can't control (I just can't control, no no!!)
When it takes over me (Over me! Yeah!!)
I let myself go!

Oh!
Woo!
Oh no!
Aha!
Oh!
Give it to me!
You gotta watch me!
'Cause you know I'm dancing right!
It's electric
He!
Yeah
Stop that beat, keep it going
Yeah, keep that
