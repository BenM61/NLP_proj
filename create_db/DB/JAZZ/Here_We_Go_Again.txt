Loyal fans and newfound followers
Whassup y'all? Hello how are you doin out there?
You're chillin I'm winnin
Oh by the way the album's out go get it
We went to the studio and then we made a video
We didn't make a movie though maybe the next year or so
Yo I got a message for my fans and friends
The last album was dope y'all and here we go again!

No applause, no applause, thank you, thank you
We're back again, and we're plannin on rockin you
ten times harder than any other crew can
Jeff is like Conan, I'm like Tarzan
In other words, wherever we go
Hahah! We're runnin the show, but no
seriously, it's been a while since we dropped one
But it's out now, go buy the album
If you bought the last one you know it was krush
But if you didn't man, you must not
know what you're missin friend
The last album was dope y'all, and here we go again!
A lot of people may not have bought the last album
Yo Jeff, straight up, we can't allow them
to go out like that, our music is too def
We produce hit records right and left
Daytime, nighttime, def beat, def rhyme
Chorus line, bass drum, snare drum, bassline
All of this makes our records rock til the party's end..
.. here we go again!

When we first came out, we had a smash hit song
Then people started askin, "What's takin so long
for y'all to put another record out for the airwaves?"
I said, "Hold up - let me explain.
When you hear a record on your radio station
it's probably getting played all throughout the nation
But we got lucky, ours was played in Germany
France, Japan, Sweden London Italy
So therefore, we had to go on tour
City after city, 'Encore encore, bravo bravo!'
Sorry we gotta go
We got another show tomorrow night in Rio"
The point I'm tryin to make is to let you all know
It takes a LONG TIME to travel the globe
But now we gotta start this whole process all over again
The last album was def, and here we go again!

Special thanks, to everyone that helped us
Without you, we would not have been able to sell
as many records, we went top ten
And got real and we'll do it again
It was a long hard road, believe me
People tryin to steal from me, and deceive me
But that's cool, you live and learn my friends
We did it before, and we'll do it agaim
