Faded - collapsing new people
Watch them - collapsing
Jaded - collapsing new people
Watch them - collapsing

Stay awake all night
But never see the stars
And sleep all day
On a chain link bed of nails

Faded - collapsing new people
Watch them - collapsing
Dated - collapsing new people
Watch them - collapsing

Steer clear of the sun
Pancake, sandpaper skin
They have no reflections
Drink blood but pierce no veins

Hated...

Exaggerate the scar tissue
Wounds that never heal
Takes hours of preparations
To get that wasted look

Hated - collapsing new people
Watch them - collapsing
Wasted - collapsing new people
Watch them - collapsing

Fated - collapsing new people
Watch them - collapsing

Dated - collapsing new people
Watch them, collapsing
