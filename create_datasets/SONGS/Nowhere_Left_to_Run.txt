I've got nowhere left to run
I've got nowhere left to hide
If you leave me
If you leave me
I would die
I've got nowhere left to run
I've got nowhere left to hide
If you leave me
If you leave me
I would die

Without you I'm not a survivor
Without you
Without you I'm not a survivor
Without you
Without you I'm not a survivor
I can't live
Without you I'm not a survivor

'Cause I need you
Yes I need you
To save me
To save me

I've got no more love to give
I've got no more tears to cry
If you leave me
If you leave me
I would die

'Cause I need you
Yes I need you
To save me
To save me

'Cause I need you
Yes I need you
To save me
To save me

I've got nowhere to run, run
Nowhere to run, run

Ooh...

'Cause I need you
Yes I need you
To save me
To save me

I've got nowhere left to run
I've got nowhere left to hide
If you leave me
If you leave me
I would die

I've got nowhere
I've got nowhere
If you leave me
If you leave me
I would die

Without you I'm not a survivor
