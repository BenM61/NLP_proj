When I think about those dog days, 
I was doing everybody wrong, 
Couldn't keep my thoughts straight 
Couldn't keep my trousers on, 
Now I pray it's not too late
To take the chance before it's gone.

That I don't go down that same road twice, 
That I won't be taking Satan's advice, 
I must admit I've paid that price 
But I'm saying goodbye to bad advice 

People you can save your judgment 
For somebody who might give a damn, 
Go and blow your two cents, 
On a horn in a traffic jam, 
At any rate it's much too late to blame myself for who I am 

Just hope I don't go down that snake road twice 
That I won't be taking another bite 
I must admit temptation's nice
But I'm saying goodbye to bad advice, oh, 
You, bad advice. 

I'm always making the same mistake, 
All this taking is hard to take, 

When I think about bygone days 
I was doing everybody wrong 
Always taking the long way 
And ending up where I don't belong 
Now I pray it's not too late to change the path I'm running on 

Oh I hope I don't go down that same road twice, 
That I won't be taking Satan's advice, 
I hope the memories will suffice 
But I'm saying goodbye 
I hope I don't go down that snake road twice, 
That I won't be taking another bite 

I hope the memories will suffice 
But I'm saying goodbye 
I must admit temptation's nice
But I'm saying goodbye to bad advice
I'm saying goodbye to bad advice, oh. 

Bad advice, bad advice.
