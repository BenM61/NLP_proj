Promises, promises
Promises, promises

Yesterday I was sure life was just like a dream
But it just goes to show
(Love has no guarantee)
All along they could see
That you were laughing at me
I was blind to the truth
(Now you're down on your knees)

Shouldn't be running
I know it sounds funny
I was such a fool
Cause I couldn't see it coming

Just a hand full of promises
You gave me
A pocketful of dreams
That just won't do
How can I go on
With nothing to live on
But a handful of promises

Promises, promises (You gave me)Promises, promises (You gave me)
Well you cheat, and you lie
And you hurt me this way
Gave my heart, didn't I?
(But you gave it in vain)
Such a fool to believe
You'd take me seriously
Didn't I treat you right
(But how wrong can you be)

Shouldn't be running
I know it sounds funny
All that I'm left with
Is a whole lot of nothing

Just a hand full of promises
You gave me
A pocketful of dreams
That just won't do
How can I go on
With nothing to live on
But a handful of promises

Promises, promises (You gave me) promises, promises (You gave me)
P-p-promises, p-p-promises
P-p-promises, p-p-promises
(But how wrong can you be)

Shouldn't be running
I know it sounds funny
I was such a fool
Cause I couldn't see it coming

Just a hand full of promises
You gave me
A pocketful of dreams
That just won't do
How can I go on
With nothing to live on
But a handful of promises (Promises, promises)

Just a hand full of promises
You gave me
A pocketful of dreams
