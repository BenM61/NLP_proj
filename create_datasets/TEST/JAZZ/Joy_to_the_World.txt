Jeremiah was a bullfrog 
Was a good friend of mine 
I never understood a single word he said 
But I helped him a-drink his wine 
And he always had some mighty fine wine 
Singing

Joy to the world 
All the boys and girls now 
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea 
Joy to you and me 

If I were the king of the world 
Tell you what I'd do 
I'd throw away the cars and the bars and the war 
Make sweet love to you 
Sing it now

Joy to the world 
All the boys and girls 
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea 
Joy to you and me 

You know I love the ladies 
Love to have my fun 
I'm a high life flyer and a rainbow rider 
A straight shooting son-of-a-gun (oh yeah) 
I said a straight shooting son-of-a-gun 

Joy to the world 
All the boys and girls 
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea 
Joy to you and me 

Joy to the world 
All the boys and girls 
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea 
Joy to you and me 

Joy to the world 
All the boys and girls 
Joy to the world 
Joy to you and me 

Joy to the world 
All the boys and girls now 
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea 
Joy to you and me 

Joy to the world 
All the boys and girls 
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea 
Joy to you and me 

I wanna tell you 
Joy to the world 
All the boys and girls 
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea 
Joy to you and me 

Joy to the world 
All the boys and girls 
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea 
Joy to you and me 
 
Joy to the world 
All the boys and girls
