A heart that longs for you
Two arms that will be true
These things I offer you
For a lifetime

Two lips with one desire
To set your heart afire
These things I offer you
For a lifetime

A cozy little nest
Just meant for us to share
Perhaps a tiny guest
Will be arriving there

My life, my love, my whole
Are at your beck and call
These things I offer you
For a lifetime

These things I offer you
For a lifetime
These things I offer you
For a lifetime

A cozy little nest
Just meant for us to share
Perhaps a tiny guest
Will be arriving there

My life, my love, my whole
Are at your beck and call
These things I offer you
For a lifetime
