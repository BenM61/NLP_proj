Was raining in my heart
Falling deep inside of me
Drowning in my soul
This silence rushes over me
I am breath against this fire
And I will not turn away
I'm waiting for time to carry me
Like a tempest to the sea

Standing strong
Watching over
Love will keep me believing
through the dark, can you hear me calling
Holding on when I'm dreaming
Love is all, Love is all
Thundering on high
Love was all I knew before I fell

And now the shots of man
Are echoing inside myself
I am breath against this fire
And I will not turn away
I'm waiting for time to carry me
Like a tempest to the sea
Standing strong
Watching over
