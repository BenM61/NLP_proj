Feeling heart beats, steal all other sound
When I thought my soul burnt out
Oh, I beg you come
I beg you come
I beg you come
Make it out of there and say you feel it now

Want you to feel it, breathe it, let it take you down
Take your time, don't throw it out
Oh, I beg you come
I beg you come
I beg you come
Just get out of there and say you need it now

Won't you come and pass the time?
Lay your hand upon the mold she left behind
Appease my mind
So it's just this once
It's all I ever want

I know I'm stealing love and draining out it's light
I'll find my own some time
I beg you come
I beg you come
I beg you come
Just get out of there and say you needed mine

Won't you come and pass the time?
Lay your hand upon the mold she left behind
Appease my mind
Let the heart decide
C'mon face this side
It's always just this once
It's all I need
It's all I ever want
