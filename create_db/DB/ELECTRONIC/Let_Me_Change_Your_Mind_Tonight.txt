Baby, should've known that it was late
Were you sleeping?
Were you lying there awake?
Must have been crazy
Should've never gone this far
Like a fool I did not know
That I was breaking us apart
Now I see how I was wrong
I see it so clearly
Now that you've gone
How'm I gonna face it?
How'm I gonna learn?
How'm I gonna make it
Now I'm feeling you burn?
How'm I gonna get you in my life again?
Let me change your mind tonight
'Cause I know I'm wrong
Let me change your mind
Sorry I'll say it now a million times
Am I too late?
Is that you I hear crying?
Now I know just what I've done
Without you near me where can I run
How'm I gonna change it?
How's it gonna go?
How'm I gonna make it
When I need your body, heart and soul?
How'm I gonna get you in my life again?
Let me change your mind tonight
Let me steal back that heart you hide
Let me change your mind tonight
'Cause I know I'm wrong
Let me change your mind
How'm I gonna face it?
How'm I gonna know
Just how much I love you
Just how far the feeling goes?
How'm I gonna get you in my life again?
Don't make me wait
Don't make me wait, baby
Let me change your mind tonight
Let me steal back that heart you hide
Let me change your mind tonight
'Cause I know I'm wrong
Let me change your mind
