Put your swords away I'm already down
The higher we both climb the further we fall
Now were under looking up into the floor
And burn each other though we're dying for more
We're stuck on this dysfunction We love it to our death
We celebrate destruction by lighting up this bed....

You can take your love away but don't you ever leave alone
Burn the ghosts we've carried home
Come on touch me show me your imperfect too
These broken lights they shine on us tonight

We don't talk much when there's so much to say
We don't listen but yet we try anyway
My stomach sick bitter and open 
Reveries of helplessness have left me all but hopin'

We strip each others beauty and we push it to the end
We face each other smiling and leave it all unsaid

We kiss till we bleed 
We Feel So much its killing us
We fight till were free
And he threatens to leave but won't let me
We cry till we see 
Infatuations Break Us down
Were healing at three
We dance inside this tragedy

You can take your love away but don't you ever leave alone
Burn the ghosts we've carried home
Come on touch me show me your imperfect too
These broken lights they shine on us tonight
