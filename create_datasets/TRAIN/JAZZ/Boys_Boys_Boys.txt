Boys, boys, boys, boys (two, three, four)

Ice cold in the summer, iced tea in the winter
I don't allow myself to fall, but I fall every time that my heart's ever near ya
And I don't ever let 'em, spend a lot of time to forget 'em
'Cause I know what they say about these boys, they'll trip you when you fall, its a set up

So he's gorgeous, maybe he's a babe
But he ain't doing nothing but getting all in the way
Sweet nothings 'bout love will never ever mean a thing
Throw the bouquet, keep him away

There I go, there I go, there I go, woah
Try to live without them, but I'm stuck here in love again
There I go, there I go, there I go, woah
So d-damn distracting, I just can't take my mind off them, boys

Boys, boys, boys
Boys (two, three, four)

Fluid like water, spit mad game to your daughter
But I know what mama say "I'm 'bout to get burned if I'm playing with the fire"
So I don't ever let 'em, and when they cross the line, I check 'em
See the sparkle in my eyes, 'cause love is blind, it's just a matter of time 'til I friend them

So he's gorgeous, maybe he's a babe
But he ain't doing nothing but a getting all in the way
Sweet nothings 'bout love will never ever mean a thing
Throw the bouquet, keep him away

There I go, there I go, there I go, woah
Try to live without them, but I'm stuck here in love again
There I go, there I go, there I go, woah
So d-damn distracting, I just can't take my mind off them boys

Boys, boys, boys, boys (two, three, four)
Boys, boys, boys (two, three, four)

Boys like girls, sugar-sweet
Sweep 'em right up off they feet
Boys like girls who try to please
Show me that you're into me
I don't rush, I move with ease
Tell me that you love me but I won't believe
Stand (?) my ground by any means
Me, myself is all I need

(Two, three, four) boys
Boys, boys, boys, boys (two, three, four)
Boys, boys, boys, boys (two, three, four)

Hey
Hey
