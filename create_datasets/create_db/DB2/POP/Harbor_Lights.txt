Son of a Tokyo Rose
I was bound to wander from home
Stranger to whatever I'd awaken to
Spun the wheel
Took a shot in the dark
One way ticket and a runaway heart
A Sailors dream came true
The night I dreamed of you

Through the neon doorways
Down the stony streets I fell
All hands high side
All eyes a wreck I followed
Sailing shadows reds and blues
Curtains drawn but I saw through
The window to your soul
And I found you

Woah oh oh oh
The harbor lights of Venus
Shining through the breeze
That brings me back
To you my love
To you my love
To you my love
Ooh ooh ooh

My eyes must be betrayin'
But that lonesome jukebox playin'
Somethin' 'bout the harbor lights
Is calling me
Back to some Jamaican bay
Doesn't seem so far away
Keep the change
But I'll repay these memories

Dawn came in this morning
Like some old junked out melody
The words she spoke as we awoke still haunt me
"What you feel too
Won't reveal you
Let me steal you for my life"

Woah oh oh oh
The harbor lights of Venus
Shining through the breeze
That brings me back
To you my love
To you my love
To you my love

Woah oh oh oh
The harbor lights of Venus
Shining through the breeze
That brings me back
Oh to you my love
To you my love
To you my love

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
