Your eyes are sad eyes
Mine are too
It doesn't take to much to see
What we've been through

You lost your baby
And me the same
Ain't it true how love's a hurtin' game

Could I have this dance
May I be so bold
It's just my arms are empty
And the night is so cold

Wouldn't it be fine bein' lonely together
Wouldn't it be fine havin' a shoulder to share
You could tell me how he broke your heart
And I'll tell you how she broke mine
And maybe later on I could take you home
Now wouldn't it be sad bein' lonely all alone

A heart that's hurtin's
Not to hard to see
I guess he promised you the world
Like she did me

But dry your eyes now
You'll be just fine
We can drown our achin' hearts in this glass of wine

Well I hate to say
What's done is done
It's just two could ease the pain
Much better than one

Wouldn't it be fine bein' lonely together
Wouldn't it be fine havin' a shoulder to share
You could tell me how he broke your heart
And I'll tell you how she broke mine
And maybe later on I could take you home
Now wouldn't it be sad bein' lonely all alone

Love
It's such a crazy thing
All you gotta give and no regrets
But love

It can live again
Stay with me tonight
I'll make it work out right

Wouldn't it be fine bein' lonely together
Wouldn't it be fine havin' a shoulder to share
You could tell me how he broke your heart
And I'll tell you how she broke mine
And maybe later on I could take you home
Now wouldn't it be sad bein' lonely all alone
