Groovy day, 
A sunny day,
Walking through the country.

Just a breeze,
And I feel at ease,
Walkin' through the country.

Blades of grass,
Playin' with my feet,
And there's nothing so sweet,
As the way you treat me.

Walkin' through the country,
Walkin' through the country,
Walkin' through the country!

Singing!

Ohhh, feelin' good, Baby

I know there's someone,
Someone who needs you.
Walkin' through the country together,
And love's gonna,
Come to you.

Oh, what a groovy, groovy day,
A sunny day.
Walkin' through the country.

Just a breeze,
And I feel at ease,
Walkin' through the country.

Blades of grass,
Playin' with my feet,
There's nothing so sweet,
As the way you treat me.

Walkin' through the country,
Walkin' through the country,
You're walkin' through the country!

Singing!

Keep walkin' through the country, baby.
Feels good now, doesn't it?
Walkin' through the country
