Relationships ain't a democracy
I'm good if you just stay on top of me
It ain't no mystery who's in control (in control)
You're sittin' pretty, unreplacable

When we're out and havin' dinner
You get all your drinks for free
I can see who sent them over
It ain't complements of me
I can hear 'em, they're talkin'
I stay in my own lane
I can't blame 'em, though
'Cause everybody knows

That you've got the juice, yeah, yeah
That's why I keep pressin' ya, pressin' ya
Pressin' ya, pressin' ya
You've got the juice, baby
That's why I keep pressin' ya, pressin' ya
Pressin' ya, pressin' ya

It's usually freezin' when I act this way (when I act this way)
But, it's cuffin' season in the month of May (in the month of May)
They let you in, but I just stay in line (I just stay in line)
The consequence of being way too fine

When we're out and havin' dinner
You get all your drinks for free
I can see who sent them over
It ain't complements of me
I can hear 'em, they're talkin'
I stay in my own lane
I can't blame 'em though
'Cause everybody knows

That you've got the juice, yeah, yeah
That's why I keep pressin' ya, pressin' ya
Pressin' ya, pressin' ya
You've got the juice, baby
That's why I keep pressin' ya, pressin' ya
Pressin' ya, pressin' ya

I've been a handful, but now I got it right
I'd be a damn fool if I didn't recognize
I gotta keep up, so I should keep it tight
I got a main squeeze, so I better squeeze it right
I've been a handful, but now I got it right
I'd be a damn fool if I didn't recognize
I gotta keep up, so I should keep it tight

You've got the juice, baby
That's why I keep pressin' ya, pressin' ya
(I keep) pressin' ya, pressin' ya

I've been a handful, but now I got it right (handful)
I'd be a damn fool if I didn't recognize (damn fool)
