To share is to split

Things that used to be one
Become divided being in halves
Violence turns into fear
Breath in duality, like twins start to feel

Those halves are developing well
My wounds are remainders
Painful as hell
Either one face each on one side
Like a wall in the heart
Like twins torn apart

Let's boost everybody's bonfire
Yeah, greater than one
For everyone
Don't hand down the blackness
Quizzical pig
Give up your loot
Too big for your boots

Coming together
Falling apart To share is to split
Come on, Come on
Lets be split
To share is to split
Come on, let us split

Find out the way that it feels
Structures fall to pieces
Deny Your Ideals
Bury the Earth
Let's take every nation
Systems struggle
Borders fall
Shake the foundation

Coming together
Falling apart
To share is to split
To share is to split
Come on, let us split

Both halves are developing well
My wounds are remainders
Painful as hell
Either one face each on one side
Like a wall in the heart
Like twins torn apart
