Feels like my head is waking up,
Releasing from the bonds that locked me out.
I didn't realize that compromise would leave me in a rut.
It doesn't matter who's to blame
When all of the victims lose their names,
And all of our past mistakes
Are tattooed on the lives we claim.

Every time we face rejection enters in the same equation.
Add it up to find the sum of some unwanted wealth.

Brace yourself. I'm breaking out.
Too many years have come
And passed me by to keep the window shut.
So Brace yourself. I'm breaking out.
All of the days that couldn't keep me down
Are crumbling to the ground.

Maybe its already too late to tell if its luck or if its fate
Guiding the vehicle that couldn't keep
Our bodies heading straight.
Where are the answers that we need?
Why has it been so hard to see
That we had to lose ourselves
To find our whole lives waiting there?

Add it up to find the sum of some unwanted wealth.

Brace yourself. I'm breaking out.
Too many years have come
And passed me by to keep the window shut.
So Brace yourself. I'm breaking out.
All of the days that couldn't keep me down
Are crumbling to the ground.

So now we're writing the prologue to our story
Filling sections left from when we second
Guessed the chances that could get us here.
Take a fall and lose it all so we can see the atmosphere

So Brace yourself. I'm breaking out.
All of the days that couldn't keep me down
Are crumbling to the ground.
Go f*ck yourself. I'm breaking out.
Too many years have come and passed me by
To keep the window shut.
