Magic fills the air whenever you are near 
I can finally see the mystery of love in your eyes 
Its got me hypnotized 
It made me believe our love was meant to be 
Now some things have changed 
You're mentioning his name 
But I don't want to hear 
That you've let someone new into heart 
It's tearing me apart 
But darling I've just got to know 

Where does that leave love 
Where does that leave us 
What about the promises and dreams that mean so much 
Where does that leave me 
Living without you 
How can I go on when you are telling me we're through 
Darling if its true 
Where does that leave us 
Where does that leave love 

Holding back the tears 
Holding back the fears 
That you would really go 
And leave me here to live all alone 
No meaning in my life 
Now all that is left is a dream that's half alive 
I still need you so 
I just can't let you go 
Can't you find in me 
What you have found in somebody new 
After all that we've been through 
If I am about to lose you 

Where does that leave love 
Where does that leave us 
What about the promises and dreams that mean so much 
Where does that leave me 
Living without you 
How can I go on when you are telling me we're through 
Darling if its true 
Where does that leave us 
Where does that leave love 
Where does that leave you 
You always said that you'd be here 
How could you leave me now 
We got so much more we can share 

Where does that leave love 
Where does that leave us 
What about the promises and dreams that mean so much 
Where does that leave me 
Living without you 
How can I go on when you are telling me we're through 
Darling if its true 
Where does that leave us 
Where does that leave love
