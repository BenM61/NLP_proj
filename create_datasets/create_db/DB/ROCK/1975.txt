I woke up to greeting cards from people I don't know no more
I woke up to blue above and blue below these wooden floors
This kind of thing, it can't be told
This kind of thing, it won't be taught

I drove on the interstate wishing I had learnt to fly
She's my Canadian girl on the fifth day of July
This kind of thing, it can't be told
This kind of thing, it won't be taught

And she said time and time again
I wouldn't be alive
If it wasn't for the summer of 1975
And it'll never be
It'll never be the same
And everyone gets a moment when
It'll never be the same again

Someday I'll write it down, if it's okay, I won't change the names
I don't know how the story ends, but I know that it began this way
And this kind of thing, it can't be told
This kind of thing, it won't be taught

When she said time and time again, I wouldn't be alive
If it wasn't for the summer of 1975
It'll never be
It'll never be the same
Yeah, everyone gets a moment when
It'll never be the same again

This kind of love, you can't be told
This kind of love, you won't be taught
It'll never be
It'll never be the same
It'll never be the same again
It'll never be
It'll never be the same
And everyone gets a moment when
It'll never be the same again

Oh, she said time and time again
I wouldn't be alive
If it wasn't for the summer of 1975
