Mother tongue
I speak that language
There are no words
But there is meaning
My secret love song
My eyes swell
I'm free

Mother tongue
Never betrayed me
Inhale your life
One more breath 
I'm dancing
Lacking wings still
I can fly from you
I could lose everything
Surrendering to you
Like praying to a god above
Who doesn't even want to know you

Mother tongue
Today I curse you
Where's my voice
Have I lost my virtue
How much more can I sacrifice for you

I could lose everything
Surrendering to you
Like praying to a god
Who doesn't even want to know you
Down on my knees for you
Your hands crawling through my hair
I forgot to be cautious here

Finally I cry I cry
I could lose everything
Surrendering to you
Like praying to a god
Who doesn't even want to know you...
