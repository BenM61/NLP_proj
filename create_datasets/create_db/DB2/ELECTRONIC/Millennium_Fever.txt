Herr God, herr Lucifer 
Out of the ashes I rise 
The end of my century's sundown 
burnt into my eyes 

Backward thinking didn't get me 
where I am today 
I been dreamin' of freezing my mind 
in Californi-I-A 

Hey Cyberchrist cardiac-hero 
From the ashes I ride 
We know the meaning of life 
It's in the scream 
of my bottleneck-slide 

Backward thinking didn't get me 
where I am today 
Get a Harley, get a hard on 
Get a ride out of the U.S. of A. 

Staring at the sun 
Waiting for my time to come 

Millennium Fever 
Millennium Fever 

What are you doing after the orgy?
