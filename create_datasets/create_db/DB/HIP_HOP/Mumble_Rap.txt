Uh, fuckin' hoes that ain't worth a cent
In homes that ain't worth the rent
Perfect sense, this is the circus that I had to circumvent
If you fly, I'm turbulance
Murder murder, screamin' "F*ck 12!" with a perfect 10
In these streets runnin' 'round robbin' every fuckin' body like a tournament
Once the time has turned
This is the only shit I learned
I put a bridge over my pool, that's for all the ones that burned
I hope you pick up game, it's a pick up game, winner's ball
Hoes annoying just like the hiccups man, that's Biggie Smalls
Dope dick give your bitch withdrawals
Why'd you even get your bitch involved?
I'm gone off the liquor, I'm sicker than Paul
And call it, just listen, I'm twisted and raw
Pictured it all
I had to sacrifice, I feel extra blessed tonight
Yeah they slept on me, I flexed on 'em, and manifest to life

I been ridin' through the city on my own
Only time I see myself was in this chrome
Oh man, I been gettin' in my zone
Hearin' everybody soundin' like some clones
I just care about myself, I never need nobody else
Mumble rapping put a beer on the shelf, mumble rap
Man I been, I been trappin' on my own
Invested in my fucking self I need a loan, I'm alone  

Okay, they need to get in my hemisphere
You interfere, start to interfere
You Richard Gere with a pretty woman, I told her look ain't no tricks in here
Like the drugs white and the liquor clear
Reflect back, tryna make it clear
Bad luck, 7 years, and I ain't even break a mirror
20 years just to make it here
Don't take it there, your circle is made of squares
You shoulda been made aware
Your bitch said my face is her favorite chair
Oh God, whole squad made millions
Whole time stay real
Wonder why I can't chill
Couldn't even pay bills
Now it's LA hills
And I'm the king, Hank Hill
Can't feel, can't stand still
I blame all these damn pills
The best shit we can't feel
I'm signin' NDAs, these texts like NBA deals
But envy may kill, still don't give a f*ck how they feel

I been ridin' through the city on my own
Only time I see myself was in this chrome
Oh man, I been gettin' in my zone
Hearin' everybody soundin' like some clones
I just care about myself, I never need nobody else
Mumble rapping put a beer on the shelf, mumble rap
Man I been, I been trappin' on my own
Invested in my fucking self I need a loan, I'm alone
