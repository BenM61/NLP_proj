Well you look so cute in your Levis suit
Struttin' down Collins Street
With your Pucci shoes and your faded blues
Honey you look so neat
You dress so well no one could tell
You spend Thursdays with your mechanic
Suburban passion it's all the fashion
Your husband don't know so don't panic

Mercedes Ladies they got it made
Cos when they dig they use a silver spade
Mercedes Ladies, Mercedes Ladies.
Mercedes Ladies they got it made
Cos when they dig they use a silver spade
Mercedes Ladies, Mercedes Ladies.

You look so smug on your Persian rug
Say your Afghan's got a pedigree
You rest your head on your antique bed
And talk about your arts degree
You act so cool by your heated pool
And take your lunch at three
Own half a boutique that's oh so chic
And work hard for charity

Mercedes Ladies they got it made
Cos when they dig they use a silver spade
Mercedes Ladies, Mercedes Ladies.
Mercedes Ladies they got it made
Cos when they dig they use a silver spade
Mercedes Ladies, Mercedes Ladies.

You knew there's only one thing better than a 250S
And that's a two-eighty SL or a two-eighty SE 
and there's only one thing better
Than a three-fifty SL and that's a two-eighty CE 
Or a three-fifty SLC or a three-hundred SEL V8

Take pottery classes and you make passes
At every young man you find
Recapture your youth oh ain't it the truth
That you're just one of a kind
You could be left or you could be right
Or you might just vote for kicks
But you're the perfect wife in a perfect life
I won't bore you with politics
