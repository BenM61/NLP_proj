Standing next to you
A dream is coming true
In a heartbeat
Feeling's right
I finally see the light
In a heartbeat
Something in your eyes

Has got me hypnotized
In a heartbeat
And near or far
I try to be where you are
In a heartbeat
Wanna laugh wanna sing
Wanna do everything
In a heartbeat

Wanna live wanna be
Where's the spirits are free
In a heartbeat
Keep it up keep it down
Keep it turning around
In a heartbeat
Make it dark make it light
Make it magic tonight

In a heartbeat
It all seems strange
My whole life has changed
In a heartbeat
Love is shining through
In everything you do

Honey in a heartbeat
And something in your eyes
Has got me hypnotized
In a heartbeat
And near or far
I try to be where you are
In a heartbeat
