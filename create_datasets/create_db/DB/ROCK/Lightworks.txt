Any way the bases feel
You will be fine without

Watch as the dust takes down
The victim's mind

Bordering on imperfection's license

Everywhere I look I see a light
That tells me where I am

The day got blown
The day went by so fast
I've been thinking that there is a day
That will not come to pass
And Baby you will see
Your light will pass
Oh oh Baby you will see
Oh ooh oh your light will 

Everywhere I look
There is a light and
There's no pain

Everywhere I look
There is a light
And it will guide the way
