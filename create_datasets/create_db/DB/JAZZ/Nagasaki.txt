Fellows, if you're arn I will spin a yarn
That was told to me by Able Seaman Jones
Once he had the blues so he took a cruise

Far away from night-clubs and from saxophones
He said, "Yo ho, I've made a certain port
And when you talk about real He-Man sport"

Hot ginger and dynamite
There's nothing but that at night back in Nagasaki
Where the fellers chew tobaccy
And the women wicky wacky, woo

The way they can entertain
Would hurry a hurricane back in Nagasaki
Where the fellers chew tobaccy
And the women wicky wacky, woo

In Fujiama you get a mama
Then your troubles increase
In some pagoda, she orders soda
Earth shake, milk shakes, ten cents a piece

They kissy and huggy nice
Oh, by jingo, it's worth the price back in Nagasaki
Where the fellers chew tobaccy
And the women wicky wacky, woo

Now when the day is warm
You can keep in form
With a bowl of rice beneath a parasol
Every gentle man has to use a fan

And they only use suspenders in the fall
That's where the girls don't think of rings and furs
Gosh, it's the nicest place that ever weres

They give you a carriage free
The horse is a Japanee back in Nagasaki
Where the fellers chew tobaccy
And the women wicky wacky, woo

They sit you upon the floor
No wonder your pants get sore back in Nagasaki
Where the fellers chew tobaccy
And the women wicky wacky, woo

With sweet Kimoner, I pulled a boner
I kept it up at high speed
I got rheumatics and then psyatics
Halatosisis, that's guaranteed

You just have to act your age
Or wind up inside a cage back in Nagasaki
Where the fellers chew tobaccy
And the women wicky wacky, woo

With an ice-cream cone and a bottle of tea
You can rest all day by the hickory tree
But when night comes round, oh gosh, oh gee
Mother, Mother, Mother, pin a rose on me

Those pretty mamas in pink pajamas
They try to give you a kiss, those torrid teases
In B.V.D.ses
Heaven help a sailor on a night like this

Not too gentle and not too rough
But you've got to tell them when you've had enough
Back in Nagasaki where the fellers chew tobaccy
And the women wicky wacky, woo
