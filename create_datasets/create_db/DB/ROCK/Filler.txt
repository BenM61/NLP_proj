What happened to you?
You're not the same
Something in your head
Made a violent change

It's in your head
It's in your head
It's in your head

You call it religion
You're full of shit

Was she really worth it?
She cost you your life
You'll never leave her side
She's gonna be your wife

You call it romance
You're full of shit

Your brain is clay
What's going on? You picked up a bible
And now you're gone

You call it religion
You're full of shit
