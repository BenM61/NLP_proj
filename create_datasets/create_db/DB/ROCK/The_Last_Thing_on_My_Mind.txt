It's a lesson
Too late for the learning
Made of sand, made of sand

In the wink
Of an eye my soul is turning
In your hand, in your hand

Are you going away?
With no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace
Left behind.
Well I could have loved you better
I didn't mean to be unkind
You know, that was the last thing on my mind

You got reasons a plenty for going
This I know, this I know
For the weeds
Have been steadily growing
Please don't go, please don't go.

Are you going away?
With no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace
Left behind.
Well I could have loved you better
I didn't mean to be unkind
You know, that was the last thing on my mind
