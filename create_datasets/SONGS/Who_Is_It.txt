His embrace : a fortress 
it fuels me and places 
a skeleton of trust 
right beneath us 
bone by bone 
stone by stone 

If you ask yourself 
patiently 
and carefully: 
who is it? 
who is it?

WHO IS IT that never lets you down? 
who is it that gave you back your crown? 
and the ornaments are 
they're going around 
now they're handing it over 
they're handing it over 
handing it over 

WHO IS IT that never lets you down? 
who is it that gave you back your crown? 
and the ornaments are 
they're going around 
now -- they're handing it over 
handing it over 
He demands a closeness 
we all have earned a lightness 
carry my joy on the left 
carry my pain on the right 

If you ask yourself 
now patiently 
and carefully: 
who is it?

WHO IS IT that never lets you down? 
who is it that gave you back your crown? 
and the ornaments are 
they're going around 
and I'm handing it over 
handing it over 
handing   

WHO IS IT that never lets you down? 
who is it that gave you back your crown? 
and the ornaments are 
they're going around 
now I'm handing it over 
handing it over
