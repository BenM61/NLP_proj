Boys in blazers
Union labor
The last on the life boat to get on
Leering drivers
Weary lifers
And I wanna know is when we go on

'Cause we're traveling on
Sold for a song
We're traveling on
And it won't be long
'Til we're traveling on

Street-side smokers
Holy rollers
Find me a toilet to die on
L.A., London
Barely funded
Give me a wheel and I'll ride on, ride on, ride on

'Cause we're traveling on
Sold for a song
We're traveling on
And it won't be long
'Til we're traveling on
We're traveling on

Fawning fanfare
Nearly nowhere
Meet the new dauphin in Duluth
No one knows you
Nations loathe you
Please let me know when I can recuse myself if I choose

But we're traveling on
Sold for a song
We're traveling on
And it won't be long
We're traveling on
Sold for a song
We're traveling on
And it won't be long
'Til we're traveling on

We're traveling on
We're traveling on, on
