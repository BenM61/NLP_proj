Before we even met I had been waiting for you,
We laid eyes on each other and immediately knew
Behaving like two bandits, in a world that's going straight
They're weak, we're strong; we're right, they're wrong,
They can't stand in our way 

Lay your head upon my shoulder,
It's so good to know you're there
And we'll feel like Bonnie and Clyde
This town's too small, let's steal a car
And drive on out of here
And we'll feel like Bonnie and Clyde

Our faces on the front page, we'll be public enemies,
We'll live our lives like outlaws and we'll steal what we need
We'll rob some banks, gun down some cops, make off across the fields
Our love will just get stronger with the whole world at our heels

Lay your head upon my shoulder
It's so good to know you're there
And we'll feel like Bonnie and Clyde
They can hate us, they can hound us
We won't even care
'Cause we'll feel like Bonnie and Clyde

One day they may corner us like rats in a trap,
But can anybody else say that they've never felt like that?
Some get scared and some get mad and some just run away,
But we'll shout "death or freedom", go out with guns ablaze

Lay your head upon my shoulder
It's so good to know you're there
And we'll feel like Bonnie and Clyde
Our love will be like dynamite
Exploding everywhere
And we'll feel like Bonnie and Clyde

Just lay your head upon my shoulder
It's so good to know you're there
And we'll feel like Bonnie and Clyde
Let them chisel on our tombstones
The names they learned to fear:
Here lies Bonnie, there lies Clyde
