This tale of love
Larger than dreams
It may take a lifetime
To understand what it means
So many the tears
All the craziness and rage
Tale of love, the massage is love can bring change

'Cause it's you only you
You I feel
And I oh I
I know in my soul this it's real

And that's why I love you oh oh
Yes I love you oh oh
And I'd fight for you
Give my life for you
My heart 

But comes a day when it's not enough
And what you have the time is up 
But it's hard to turn a new page
In this tale, sweet tale of love
You will find the peace of heart that you crave

And that's why I love you oh oh
Yes I love you oh oh
And I'd fight for you
Give my life for you
My heart 

And that's why I love you oh oh
Yes I love you oh oh
And I'd fight for you
Give my life for you
My heart 

And I'd fight for you
Give my life for you
My heart
