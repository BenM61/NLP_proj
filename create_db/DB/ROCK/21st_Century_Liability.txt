In a place where they fail to inspire
I'm drinking the bleach so that I feel the fire
Inside is a riot but I'm in too deep
A mile in
A mile in

In a place where they think I'm a stranger
I'm shaving my face with a coke covered razor
I press hard so it goes in deep
A mile in
A mile in

I'm a 21st Century liability
I'm a 21st Century liability
I'm a 21st Century liability
(BANG BANG BANG)
It's all Bollocks
I'm a 21st Century liability
I'm a 21st Century liability
I'm a 21st Century liability
(BANG BANG BANG)
It's all Bollocks

When I was younger I had a proper plan
Keep myself naive take advice from the man
But I turned 17 and I saw in my head
He was blowing up the world with a ball point pen
I met a person I think I fell in love
A certain kind of love you can't find in drugs
But I fucked it up needed alone time
It's like I killed myself "I love you long time"

I'm a 21st Century liability

I'm a 21st Century liability
I'm a 21st Century liability

I'm a 21st Century liability
I'm a 21st Century liability
I'm a 21st Century liability
