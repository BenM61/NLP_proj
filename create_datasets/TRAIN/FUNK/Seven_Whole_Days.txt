Seven whole days 
And not a word from you 
Seven whole nights 
I'm just about through 
I can't take it  won't take it 
Can't take it no more 
I had about enough of you 
I'd rather be on my own 
Yes on my own 

Darlin' 
Darlin' 
You know if you cared anything about love 
You woulda been front and center 
Lovin' me and touchin' me 
Honey 
Honey 
You know if you knew anything about me 
You woulda been much more tender 
Ooh squeezin' me, caressin' me 
You coulda had about anything you wanted 
But you messed it up 
You had to be tough 
You told your friends 
You had me wrapped around your finger 
You were talking kinda cocky 
Like you had it goin' on 
All the while you knew 
That things were kinda shaky 
You knew that you were wrong 
Dead wrong to be 
Mistreating me 
How can we go on 

Seven whole days 
And not a word from you 
Seven whole nights 
I'm just about through 
I can't take it, won't take it 
Can't take it no more 
I had about enough of you 

I'd rather be on my own 
Yes on my own 

Sugar 
Sugar 
You know if you knew anything about sweet 
You woulda been talkin' to me 
Everyday 
Seven days a week 
Baby 
Baby 
You shoulda been givin' me 
A little more time 
But you were just much too busy 
Abusin' me and usin' me 
I woulda done about anything 
Ya wanted 
I was there for you 
I was crazy about you 
When I was sittin' thinkin' 
I was kinda special 
You were runnin' round 
Hittin' every other girl in town 
How could you love me 
When you knew you played me funny 
You knew that you were wrong 
Dead wrong to be 
Mistreating me 
How can we go on 

Seven whole days 
And not a word from you 
Seven whole nights 
I'm just about through 
I can't take it, won't take it 
Can't take it no more 
I had about enough of you 

I'd rather be on my own 
Yes on my own 

Deep in my heart 
You were number one to start 
But then you changed 
You threw my heart away 
Told your friends that 
You were runnin' thangs 
Why'd it have to be that way 
You're wrong 
Dead wrong 
Tell me how 
How can we go wrong 

Seven whole days 
And not a word from you 
Seven whole nights 
I'm just about through 
I can't take it, won't take it 
Can't take it no more 
I had about enough of you 

I'd rather be on my own 
Yes on my own
