Oh, I once had something
Something that was so good
Better than the last thing I touched
Then turned right around on that something
And figured I didn't like that much

Oh yeah, the grass is green
But can you tell me, can you feel it, I want to feel it
Oh yeah, the grass is green
But I think I stained my jeans and now everybody knows thah I been in it 

I am a believer
But as I was standing
In line, somebody took my place
Yes, I'm a believer, never mind what they say
I got so tired along the way

Oh yeah, the grass is green
But can you tell me, can you feel it, I just want to feel it
Oh yeah, the grass is green
But I think I stained my jeans and now everybody knows thah I been in it 

I've got a skeleton that's deeper than any closet
And a bomb that I will drop on it
But you opened up to me
'Til I could only see the beauty in your dishonesty

Oh yeah, the grass is green
But can you tell me, can you feel it, you just want to feel it
Oh yeah the grass is green
But it think I stained my jeans and now, baby, you can tell that I been in it

Oh yeah, the grass is green but it's not what it seems cause when you think
You want it you just need it
Forget just what you need
The clock is ticking and this life is a train, man, I think you're on it
But it's what you wanted, and what you needed
It's what you wanted, and what you needed
Or is it what I needed and what you wanted
