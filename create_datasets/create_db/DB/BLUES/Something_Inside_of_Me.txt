Something inside me, 
That just won't let me be 
Something inside me, 
That just won't let me be, yeah 
My baby is gone and left me, 
And my heart's in misery 
I wake up early in the mornin', 
In my bedroom all alone 
I wake up early in the mornin', 
In my bedroom all alone 
I don't find my baby, 
And I wonder, I wonder, where she gone 
Oh yeah, yeaah 
My baby's gone, 
And I'm so tired, it's a cryin' shame 
Yes, you know I'm so tired, it's a cryin' shame 
Ever since she been gone, 
You know my life don't feel the same
