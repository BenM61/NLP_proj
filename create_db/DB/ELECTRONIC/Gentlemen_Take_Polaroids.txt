Now there's a girl about town 
I'd like to know 
I'd like to slip away with you 
And if you said you love me 
How could I mind? 
Is there another side to everything you do? 

Take in the country air, you'll never win 

Gentlemen take polaroids 
They fall in love, they fall in love 

Breathe life into me 
Spin me around 
And I'll just sit and wonder why 
It's just a foreign town with a foreign mind 
Why is everything so cut and dry? 

The taste of country air, you'll never know 

Gentlemen take polaroids 
They fall in love, they fall in love 

Take in the country air, you'll never win 

Gentlemen take polaroids 
They fall in love, they fall in love
