(I still don't know what I'm doing)
F*ck
Troubles coming for the freeman
We shake them shaken with the free hand
So stand tall, shout out, with me

Do your dirty work without me
Say your best when no one can see
Stand up, catch fire, with me  
(This kids, this kids, this kids, this kids, this kids, this kids)

This kid's not alright
This kid's not alright
This kid's not alright
But this kid's not alright

I've been sleeping with these
I've been sleeping with these thoughts, man
I've been contemplating singing them
So stand up, catch fire, with me
(This kids, this kids, this kids, this kids, this kids)

You can fight all that now
This kid's not alright
This kid's not alright
This kid's not alright
But this kid's not alright

I'm scared, I may derail

You can follow them to hell
You can follow them to hell
You can follow them to hell
You can follow them to hell
You can follow them to hell
This kid's not alright (you can follow them to hell)
This kid's not alright (you can follow them to hell)
This kid's not alright (you can follow them to hell)
This kid's not alright
