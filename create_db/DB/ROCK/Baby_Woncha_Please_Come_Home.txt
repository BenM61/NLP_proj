Come home
Baby woncha please come home
I'm sitting here lonely
I'm going up the wall
Come home
Baby woncha please come home

I can't do nothin'
I can't feel nothin'
I can't be nothin'
Without you

Come home
Baby woncha please come home
This place is so empty
When you're not around
Come home
Baby woncha please come home

Ever since I woke up this morning
And found myself here all alone
I just can't seem to do nothing
Baby woncha please come home

I can't do nothin'
I can't feel nothin'
I can't be nothin'
Without you

Come home
Baby woncha please come home
I'm sitting here lonely
I'm going up the wall
Come home
Baby woncha please come home

I can't do nothin'
I can't feel nothin'
I can't be nothin'
Without you

Come home
Baby woncha please come home
This place is so empty
When you're not around
Come home
Baby woncha please come home
