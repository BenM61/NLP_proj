Ever since I met you, baby, I've been wanting to lay you down
But it's so hard to get you, baby, when you never come around
Every day that you keep it away, it only makes me want it more
Oh baby, just say the word and I'll be at your door
What more do I have to say?
I really want to play in your river
Falling, falling, falling in love
I'm falling, baby, deeper every day (in love)
You're breakin' my heart and takin' me away (in love)
I'm falling, baby, girl, what can I do?
I just can't be without you

Ever since I met you, baby
There's been something inside of me
That keeps me wanting you, baby, won't you set me free
Take off these chains, girl, and I'll take off yours
There's no one in the world, baby, that I want to love more
What else do I have to say?
I really want to play in your river

Falling, falling, falling in love
I'm falling, baby, deeper every day (in love)
You're breakin' my heart and takin' me away (in love)
I'm falling, baby, girl, what can I do?
I just can't be without you

I'm falling in love
I'm falling, baby, deeper everyday (in love)
You're breakin' my heart and takin' me away (in love)
And I'm falling, baby, girl, what can I do?
I just can't be without you

I'm falling, I'm falling (in love)
I'm drownin', baby, in my love 4 you (in love)
You're breakin' my heart and takin' me away
I just don't, I don't know what to say

In love
In love

Oh baby-girl, you're takin' me away
Oh baby, baby, oh baby, baby

In love
