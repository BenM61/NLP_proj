You sit around and you nurse your hive
The richest junkie still alive
And I won't die on my cross for you
And I won't do that time for you

It don't stop me
Don't stop me
Don't stop me
Don't feel the same

You sit around and you count your pearls
The richest junkie in the world
And over me you will not swarm
The parasites keep your body warm

It don't stop me
Don't stop me
Don't stop me
Don't feel the same
Don't stop feeding the freezing flame
The wider the damage, the deeper the vein
Supply and demand is the name of the game
It don't feel the same

Hopeless troops on the border
Some of your sicker saints
You sit around and you nurse your hive
The richest junkie still alive
