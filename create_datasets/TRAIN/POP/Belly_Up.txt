Our old world is hard to find
I doubt it was ever mine
To keep
Were you always this unkind?

We lie belly up
In the pool of us
We lie belly up
In the pool of us

I don't recognize your doubt
Please say something
Darling, shout at me
How unfair to shut me out

We lie belly up
In the pool of us
We lie belly up
In the pool of us
We lie belly up
In the pool of us
We lie belly up
In the pool of us

I must say, I'll
Always love you
Even if it hurts

Have I driven us to this?
Our bickering
Has reached its limit
I can't remember our last kiss

We lie belly up
In the pool of us
We lie belly up
In the pool of us
We lie belly up
In the pool of us
We lie belly up
In the pool of us

I must say, I'll
Always love you
Even if it hurts
I must say, I'll
Always love you
Even if it hurts

(Whoa)

La la la la 
La la la la
Belly up

(Ah)

La la la la
La la la la
Belly up

(Ah)

La la la la
La la la la
Belly up

(Ow)

La la la la
La la la-la

(Whoa)

I must say I'll
Always love you
Even if it hurts
I must say I'll
Always love you
Even if it hurts
