I tore my letter up, couldn't even start 
To tell you what's really here in my heart 
There's only so much that words can say 
So I sent you a piece of this beautiful day 

Oh, I want you to know that I took a rainbow 
And sent it off in a letter to you 
Took some flowers in the spring, made a sweet clover ring 
And sent it off in a letter to you 
Took a song from the lark - the moon from the dark 
A spark with the sparkling dew 
With a kiss and a hug and a whole lot of love 
I sent 'em off in a letter to you 

I took the mornin' sun, peekin' throgh the trees 
And the dandelion silk tangled in the breeze 
I folded 'em up - sealed 'em with a kiss 
It's the kind of letter that you can't resist 

Oh, I want you to know that I took a rainbow 
And sent it off in a letter to you 
Took some flowers in the spring, made a sweet clover ring 
And sent it off in a letter to you 
Took a song from the lark - the moon from the dark 
A spark with the sparkling dew 
With a kiss and a hug and a whole lot of love 
I sent 'em off in a letter to you 

In a day or two - just you wait and see 
You're gonna get a special delivery 
You'll know the way I feel - there can't be any doubt 
When you open it up and let the love spill out 

Oh, I want you to know that I took a rainbow 
And sent it off in a letter to you 
Took some flowers in the spring, made a sweet clover ring 
And sent it off in a letter to you 
Took a song from the lark - the moon from the dark 
A spark with the sparkling dew 
With a kiss and a hug and a whole lot of love 
I sent 'em off in a letter to you 

You know
I sent 'em off in a letter to you 
Ooohh, baby
I sent 'em off in a letter to you 
You know
See what I want? (in a letter to you)
Ooohh, baby
See what I want? (in a letter to you)
Woooh!
