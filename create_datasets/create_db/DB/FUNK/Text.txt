Hit me wit a text
Let me know you're home alone
Freaky wit that camera phone
Hit you wit a text

Hit me and I'll be around
Hit you wit a text
On the low
Nobody will have to know

Ah she hit me up in the morning
She be textin' when she stretchin' and yawnin'
She be like "good morning"
I be like "good morning"
While I'm makin' cereal the milk I be pourin'
And I'm eatin' breakfast, never gettin' restless
Like I live in Dallas the way I'm readin' Texas (texts)
Very interesting,
Always the worst when she be gettin' freaky
But don't do it in person
She be tryna tease me
And my dude, it be workin'
When we workin', the text message be jerkin' yeahhh
That's why I love my female
She send me naked pics straight to my e-mail

As long as she get at me I don't care it's all the same
And when her phone rang
My ringtone playin' like
Hit me wit a text

A lace top cutie
And her icon is a pic of her booty
Say she miss me and we see each other often
Don't call girl, let the finger do the talkin'
