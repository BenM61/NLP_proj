Turn the television on
You've been reading too long
Turn your radios on
And I'll sing you a song

Let's get back to basics
I know just what you need
I'm talented by the way you feel
Flattery's a deed of attraction
It seems you're changing direction to me

Turn the television on
You've been reading too long
Turn your stereo on
And I'll sing you a song

Charity's a good investment
What hard times we're living through
Thinking of us face to face like this
So this is what destiny feels like
Adapt improvise overcome

Turn the television on
You've been reading too long
Turn your radios on
Nothing else is going on

Trade test transmission
Turn the television on
Nothing else is going on

Turn the television on
You've been reading too long
Turn your radios on
I will sing you my song

Trade test transmission
Turn the television on
Nothing else is going on

Trade test transmission
Turn the television on
Nothing else is going on
Turn me on
Turn me on
