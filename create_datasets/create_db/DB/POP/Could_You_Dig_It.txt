Could you dig holdin' my hand?
Could you dig standin' by my side?
Could you dig it, baby?
Please let me know
'Cause I know I could love you oh

Could you dig bein' my girl?
Could you dig settin' the world on fire?
Could you dig it, baby?
Please let me know
'Cause I know I could love you oh
Won't you be my girl?

I know your heart is filled with mixed emotions
I'll give you all my love, all my devotion
Could you dig it, dig it, dig it?

Could you dig bein' mine forever?
Could you love me, love me love me, tell me you would?
Could you dig it, baby?
Please let me know
'Cause I know I could love you oh
Won't you be my girl?
Could you dig it?

(repeat and fade):
Could you dig it?  Won't you be my girl?
