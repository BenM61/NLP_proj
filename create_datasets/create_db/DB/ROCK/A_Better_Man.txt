Once in a while, I drift in time
To a place in my memory that it still hurts to find
I was taking on the world with a see through smile
But dying on the inside all the while
I was dying on the inside all the while

Like a martyr that don't want sympathy
I locked away my feelings and threw away the key
It was gonna take a miracle to pierce my pride
And you were the tower of strength that tried
When your loving washed right over me like the tide

[Chorus:]
And now I believe in love, I believe in love, you're the reason why I can
''cause when I look at myself in the mirror, I see a better man, a better man

Yes it's hard finding words that can say how I feel about you
I don't care if it sounds like another old cliche
But I can't stand the thought of living my life without you for even a day

(Solo)
And now I believe in love, yes I believe in love, you're the reason why I can
''cause when I look at myself in the mirror
Oh baby when I look at myself in the mirror
When I'm looking at myself in the mirror, I see a better man
