Everybody sunshine
What a feeling
To sing for freedom
Around the world

Just like a vision there before me
Were the children of many lands
All diff'rent races were united
Reaching out and touching hands
Children laughing, children dancing, singing a song
They loved each other like sister
Brother and the whole world sang along

Everybody sunshine, everybody fun time
We've got the power, we've got the lord
Everybody hands up, what a feeling
To sing for freedom around the world

It's an illusion that I'm dreaming
Only wishing of what could be
But we can make it really happen
Share my vision, sing with me
Catch a rainbow, and let your love flow
Dream on and on
Let's love each other like sister
Brother make the whole world sing along

Everybody sunshine, everybody fun time
We've got the power, we've got the lord
Everybody hands up, what a feeling
To sing for freedom around the world

Everybody sunshine, everybody fun time
We've got the power, we've got the lord
Everybody hands up, what a feeling
To sing for freedom around the world

Catch a rainbow, and let your love flow
Dream on and on
Let's love each other like sister
Brother make the whole world sing along

Everybody sunshine, everybody fun time
We've got the power, we've got the lord
Everybody hands up, what a feeling
To sing for freedom around the world

Everybody sunshine, everybody fun time
We've got the power, we've got the lord
Everybody hands up, what a feeling
To sing for freedom around the world

Everybody sunshine, everybody fun time
We've got the power, we've got the lord
Everybody hands up, what a feeling
To sing for freedom around the world

Everybody sunshine, everybody fun time
We've got the power, we've got the lord
Everybody hands up, what a feeling
To sing for freedom around the world
