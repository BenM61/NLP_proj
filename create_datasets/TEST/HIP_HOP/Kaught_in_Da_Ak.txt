Verse 1: Books

Uh
Well say hello to the bad guy or am I or (shit) 'cause I'm ya

for the props and top dollar, G I'm doin what I gotta, see
I puts the fear in ya heart kid, I start (fuckin) for nuttin
and no this ain't the dope that catch ya cuttin, bust
Now's the time to make my move 'cause I'm out to do tha
kid that tried to slip for some buda, sleep (word up)
I peeped every spot his boys be, I got crew
But what am I do is get somebody new to do it for me
I'm catchin wreck to prove a point, time is loot
and I ain't spinnin it in the joint but better yet
These days I'm all professional, some new (shit) I got
I check this nigga that I used to snatch jewels wit
back in the day but nevertheless the kid's ass' slingin gas
to pay bills to 'ford some pills that kill stress (I hear ya kid)
Now as for me G let's just say I learnt the rules
I paid my dues and now I cruise in my Lexus
No better time than the present to make him an offer
He can't refuse but might regret it, so I'ma set it

Verse 2: Dray

Well, umm, take this job and shove it

Catch a fit money grip 'cause pumpin gas is a bitch way
Niggas be ridin by my job and frontin like they bitchin
I want to bust wit disgust 'cause I'm sour (aha)
Takin all the (shit) and only gettin four dollars a hour
There go some bitches swearin that they better
givin a cold shoulder as they roll by in the (fuckin) jetter
I gets no pay though 'cause they know that you know
can't wait to take a (fuckin) break so I can go and puff this buddha
I'm bustin my ass but my cash just ain't stockin
Now who's this creepin up the (fuckin) block-in?
Clockin, lookin like he really want to test this
Just another dick, I oughta stick him for that Lexus
The (shit) is killin me, why this kid grillin me?

up wit some hot (shit), I spot (shit), I'm buggin
I fuckin know this nigga because he used to be thuggin

We used ta rob niggas back in the day when I was illin

Umm, let him kick it 'cause I ain't tryin to sink in
I need to make this dough so now ya know he got me thinkin
