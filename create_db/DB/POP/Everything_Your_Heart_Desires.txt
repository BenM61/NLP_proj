You say you can't stand to be
Tied so close to a lover
Ooh you feel like a prisoner
And you want to find someone who will let you out
Can't you see the heartbeat that you know so well
Is better than some strange one you're looking for
Say you never know that strange one just might be me

Can't you see -
You have everything your heart desires
So why d'you want more
If you had everything your heart desired
Would you still want more
You have everything your heart desires
Why d'you won't more
If you have everything your heart desires
Oh baby will you still want more

You tell me your best friend's world seems beautiful
But don't be fooled
It's nice work if you can get it
What goes on behind closed doors you don't know
Maybe she cries herself to sleep every night
Sorry that the heartbeat that she knows so well
Ain't what she's looking for
Say you never know that strange heart just might be me

Can't you see -
You have everything your heart desires
So why d'you want more
If you had everything your heart desired
Would you still wand more
You have everything your heart desires
Why d'you want more
If you have everything your heart desires
Will you still want more

Maybe you'll confess
Girl you'll see
If you want.the world
Think of me
No words can help
Don't be sad
'cause baby what you want is what you have
