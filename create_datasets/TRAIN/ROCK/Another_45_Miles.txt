Here comes the night
A veil over the light
In the distance some shadows of the clouds in the sky
I've got to get home, to my child, my wife

Here comes the night
I'm scared to death, got to get me a ride
It looks like the road is swallowing me up
Gotta hurry home, don't dare to look back
Blueville is straight ahead

Another 45 miles to go
Another 45 miles before I'm home
I wish the sunlight was burning in my eyes
Instead of shades, black faces of the skies

Another 45 miles to go
Another 45 miles before I'm home
I wish I could pay the sun to run
Then I had some more time, with my wife, my son

Clouds in the sky
Gathering for a fight
Chasing their prey till it can't go on
I mend my pace 'cause my bride is waiting home

Here comes the night
I'm scared to death, got to get me a ride
It looks like the road is swallowing me up
Gotta hurry home, don't dare to look back
Blueville is straight ahead

Another 45 miles to go
Another 45 miles before I'm home
I wish the sunlight was burning in my eyes
Instead of shades, black faces of the skies

Another 45 miles to go
Another 45 miles before I'm home
I wish I could pay the sun to run
Then I had some more time, with my wife, my son
