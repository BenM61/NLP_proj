Endlessly,
I'm counting down the days
When you will come my way

Endlessly,
I fall asleep to a dream
And you're here again it seems, endlessly

I'm looking for you everywhere that I go
In all of the things I do
Still I'll keep looking, 
'Til I find you, 
'Til I find you

Endlessly,
I turn to every door
And it's you I'm hoping for, so endlessly
I'm looking for you every where that I go

In all of the things I do
Still I'll keep looking
'Til I find you
'Til I find you
'Til I find you
'Til I find you
