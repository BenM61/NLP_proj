We are the soldiers under God's command 
We hold His two-edged sword within our hands 
We're not ashamed to stand up for what's right 
We win without sin, it's not by our might 
And we're fighting all the sin 
And the good book, it says we'll win 

Soldiers, Soldiers, under command 
Soldiers, Soldiers, fighting the Lords battle plan 

Are you a soldier under God's command 
Help fight the good fight, join us while you can 
The battle that's waiting is fought so easily 
Through Him, without sin there is victory 
And were fighting all the sin 
And the good book, it says we'll win

Soldiers, Soldiers, under command 
Soldiers, Soldiers, fighting the Lords battle plan

Soldiers, Soldiers, under command 
Soldiers, Soldiers, fighting the Lords battle plan
