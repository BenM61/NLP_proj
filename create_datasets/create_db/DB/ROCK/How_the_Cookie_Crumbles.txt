I'm just a dog in a white man's city
Looking for my mother
People they say this place is pretty
Yeah it's pretty ugly

My dirty brain, my angry brain
It won't shut up it's driving me insane
My dirty brain, my angry brain
I wanna throw you underneath a train
I need a love, but I ain't boyish, I ain't fuzzy toy-ish
People hate me 'cause I ain't mediocre
They wanna kill the joker
That's how the cookie crumbles baby
Creeps in balaclavas
They're shootin' and a lootin'
'Cause it's money baby
It's money baby
It's money baby

Hello, my name is Igor
Do you like my balaclava
Let's start a revolution baby
That's how the cookie crumbles baby
White creeps in balaclavas
They're shootin' and a lootin'
'Cause it's power baby
My dirty brain, my angry brain
It won't shut up it's driving me insane
My dirty brain, my angry brain
I wanna throw you underneath a train
