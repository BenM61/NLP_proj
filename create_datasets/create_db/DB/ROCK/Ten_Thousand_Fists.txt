Survival
Survival

One more goddamn day when I know what I want
And my want will be considered tonight, considered tonight
Just another day when all that I want
Will mark me as a sinner tonight, I'm a sinner tonight, yeah

People can no longer cover their eyes
If this disturbs you, then walk away
You will remember the night you were struck by the sight of
Ten thousand fists in the air

Power unrestrained and dead on the mark
Is what we will deliver tonight, deliver tonight
Pleasure fused with pain is triumph of the soul
Will make you shiver tonight, will make you shiver tonight, yeah

People can no longer cover their eyes
If this disturbs you, then walk away
You will remember the night you were struck by the sight of
Ten thousand fists in the air

We are the ones that will open your mind
Leave the weak and the haunted behind
(We are the ones that will open your mind)
Leave the weak and the haunted behind
(We are the ones that will open your mind)
Leave the weak and the haunted behind
(We are the ones that will open your mind)
Leave the weak and the haunted behind

People can no longer cover their eyes
If this disturbs you, then walk away
You will remember the night you were struck by the sight of
Ten thousand fists in the air

Ten thousand fists in the air
Ten thousand fists in the air
