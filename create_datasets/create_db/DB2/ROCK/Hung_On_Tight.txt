Oh my sister
Will you hold my hand

The big blue chair
You're soaking in

Eating laughter from a can
And it will until we 

I hung on tight
Just to keep hold to her
I hung on tight
'Cause I thought I loved her

Oh my marvel
You suck me in

Tell me stories I was to sing
Flying dragons in my sleep

Tell me stories
I wish you'd speak

I hung on tight
Just to keep hold to her
I hung on tight
'Cause I thought I loved her

I hung on tight
Just to keep hold to her
I hung on tight

Oh my love
How you touch my skin

It feels so long
Since it has been

Wanna see you smile
Wanna see you dancin'! 

Was it through
For my nameless plans

I hung on tight
Just to keep hold to her
I hung on tight
'Cause I thought I loved her

I hung on tight
Just to keep hold to her
I hung on tight
'Cause I thought I loved her
