Oh hoo hoo
Hot night she's running right
And magic's in the air
So what do I care

The one in red straight ahead
Sets my soul on fire
We're taking it higher

The message from the coast is loud and clear
Cool running
The second I get off I'm out of here
Cool running yeah
Oh hoo

Aim south we're chilling out
The boss is on the phone
Tell him I'm gone

That's right Snow White
We're blowin' the blues away
Call 'em back another day

Got no time for talkin' to no phone
Cool running yeah
We'll send them all a postcard from the zone
Cool running yeah

You see Miss it's like this
We're about to lose control
Well it beats getting old
Hey

Predictions for the coast say bright and clear
Cool running yeah
The forecast for my head is out of here

Cool running yeah

The message from the coast is loud and clear
Cool running
The second I get off I'm out of here
Cool running yeah

Oh doctor man I hope relief soon come
Cool running yeah
Sometimes the best prescription is to run
Cool running yeah

Ooh ooh hoo hoo hoo
