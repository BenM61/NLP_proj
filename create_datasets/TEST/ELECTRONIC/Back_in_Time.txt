What's this scenery, I can see it clearly.
I'm the visionary, it's the moment of my birth.

The intention's here, this was how I planned to be
But really shows the weaker part of me.

I wish that I could turn back time.

Journey far beyond my memory,
Driven back in time.
Travel to my secret history,
Driven back in time,
Driven back in time,
Driven back in time.

Though the centuries, I tried to get experienced.
Now I have to see, wisdom starts where knowledge ends.

Once again I've failed, I didn't use my precious time
To fulfill my part, to remember me that I'm

Liked into the global vision

Journey far beyond my memory...
