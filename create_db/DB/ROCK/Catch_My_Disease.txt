My head is a box full of nothing
And that's the way I like it
My garden's a secret compartment
And that's the way I like it
And that's the way I like it
Your body's a dream that turns violent
And that's the way I like it
And that's the way I like it
The winter is long in the city
And that's the way I like it

So please
Baby please
Open your heart
Catch my disease

I was backstage in Pomona
And that's the way I like it
She drank beer with coca-cola
And that's the way I like it
And that's the way I like it
She told me about the winds from Santa Anna
And that's the way I like it
And that's the way I like it
She told me she loved me like fireworks
And that's the way I like it

So please
Baby please
Open your eyes
Catch my disease

So please (PLEASE!)
Baby please
Come on
Catch my disease
Catch it

They play good Charlotte on the radio
And that's the way I like it
They play sleepy Jackson on the radio
And that's the way I like it
And that's the way I like it
I hear Beyonce on the radio
And that's the way I like it
And that's the way I like it
They don't play me on the radio
But that's the way I like it

So please
Baby please
Open your heart
And catch my disease
So please
Baby please
Come on
Catch my disease
(catch my disease)
(catch my disease)
(catch my disease)
(catch my disease)
