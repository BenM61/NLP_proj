We're the boys, turning inside out
Open right, so tight without a doubt
We're the boys, always wrong and always right
We are the boys from nowhere and we're going home tonight

Meet us on the outside where the darkness shines so bright
On the Autobahn where we first found our souls
'Cause when the world is over, we're still the boys from nowhere
And tonight, tonight we're coming home, yeah, yeah

We're the boys, heavier than light
So beyond repair but out of spite
Faraway's near, the only beacon's the night
Scarier than fear but that's alright

See you on the outskirts where the wasteland meets the night
By the railroad tracks, we first found our souls
'Cause when the world is over, we're still the boys from nowhere
And tonight, tonight we're coming home, I gotta go

What are ya doing? We don't know
Where are ya going? We don't care
No, no, no, no, no, no
You'll never know

Meet us on the highway where the headlights shine so bright
By the gas station where we first found our souls
'Cause when the world is over, we're still the boys from nowhere
And tonight, tonight we're coming home, yeah, yeah

Tonight, tonight we're coming home
Oh tonight, tonight we're coming
We're coming home, yeah
So come on
