I'm
I wish I could go with you
Everybody says it, I know that doesn't make it less true
I want to go where you go
I
I'm left out in the cold, fully clothed while you do your best
To get undressed

I
I think this is a real thing
I wish I knew your real name
What's your address
I
I'm left out in the cold
Fully clothed, while you do your best
To get undressed

You might be rich, but I have all the fun
You're lying to yourself while I lie in the sun
Hold your broken dreams close to your broken heart
It's nothing new to me 'cause I've been broke right from the start
I soared from the sky like an angel in the dark
You're trying to catch my wings you think you're someone that you're not
The water's crystal clear I walk while your make-up runs
The last words that you hear
Blondes have more fun

You might be rich, but I have all the fun
You're lying to yourself while I lie in the sun
Hold your broken dreams close to your broken heart
It's nothing new to me 'cause I've been broke right from the start
I soared from the sky like an angel in the dark
You're trying to catch my wings you think you're someone that you're not
The water's crystal clear I walk while your make-up runs
The last words that you hear
Blondes have more fun
