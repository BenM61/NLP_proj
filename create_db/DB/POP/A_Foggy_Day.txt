A foggy day 
In London town 
It had me low 
And it had me down

I viewed the morning 
With much alarm 
The British Museum 
Had lost its charm

How long I wondered 
Could this thing last 
But the age of miracles 
It hadn't past

And suddenly 
I saw you standing right there
And in foggy London town 
The sun was shining everywhere
