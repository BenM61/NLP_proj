Queen to your King
Don't be afraid to move away to safety
I know you well, I can tell when your heart is feelin' lonely
I've seen those knights in armor guardin' your door
Oh, but I'm gonna keep on comin' 'til you can't move no more
 
You can bait me, fake me, yeah
But I keep on comin' at ya
You break me, shake me, yeah
I ain't movin' backwards
Shake me, take me, yeah
I keep on goin'
'Til I hold you in checkmate once more, mmm
 
I'm a Queen to your King
Yes, I've been told that you use your pawn to hurt me
Oh, nothing's been gained
Oh, I can see that your Bishop's lies then wonders
Oh, if he could stop me with the power he holds
It ties me, it ties me over with his prison, his goal
 
You can bait me, fake me
But I keep on comin' at ya
Just break me, shake me
I ain't movin' backwards
Shake me, take me, yeah
I keep goin' 'til I hold you in checkmate once more
Ooh, 'til I hold you in checkmate once more
 
Bait me, fake me, aah
But I keep comin' at ya
Break me, shake me, aah
I ain't movin', I ain't movin', I ain't movin'
Oh, but I keep comin' at ya
Take me, shake me
I ain't movin', I ain't movin' backgrounds, yeah
I ain't movin', 'cause I ain't movin' backwards, yeah, oh
I ain't movin', oh, I keep on comin' at ya
Yeah, aah, yeah, I ain't movin', yeah
Break me, shake me, yeah
I keep on comin' at ya
I ain't movin', I ain't movin' backwards
I ain't movin, I ain't movin
