When I'm kissing my love
I can hear a thump thumping in my head
when I'm kissing my love
I close my eyes and see a pretty city
With a million flower beds

I can hear the angels sing
Songs that only angels sing
And I can feel my heart
Just a thumping and a skipping
When I'm kissing my love

When I'm kissing my love
I feel the blood pump pumping in my veins
When I'm kissing my love
She's such a tender send
With a sweet young frame

She's so good at what she does
All she wants to do is kiss and hug
She's got me in love
And I can feel my heart
Just a thumping and a skipping
