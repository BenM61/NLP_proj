There are nine million bicycles in Beijing
That's a fact
It's a thing we can't deny
Like the fact that I will love you
'Til I die

We are twelve billion light years from the edge
That's a guess
No one can ever say it's true
But I know that I will always be with you

I'm warm by the fire
Of your love every day
So don't call me a liar
Just believe everything that I say

There are six billion people in the world
More or less
And it makes me feel quite small
That you're the one I love the most of all

We're high on a wire
With the world in our sight
And I'll never tire
Of the love that you give me every night

There are nine million bicycles in Beijing
That's a fact
It's a thing we can't deny
Like the fact that I will love you
'Til I die
