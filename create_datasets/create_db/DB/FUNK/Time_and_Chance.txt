Don't it hurt so bad... Time...
And it hurt so bad... Chance...

Tryin' to find the faith before the fall
Good man's down, while a bad man's standin tall
Strongest one don't always win them all
Going crazy, going crazy
Time and chance

Don't it hurt so bad... Time...
And it hurt so bad... Chance...
(Oh chance and time)

The way they do my life is going round
Never straight up, sideways, upside down
Brothers livin' six feet underground
Oh got me crazy, I'm so crazy
Ohh... Time and chance
Don't it hurt so bad... Time...
And it hurt so bad... Chance...

So bad... So, so bad
A poor man lives in happiness
A millionaire evil as he want to be
A good man going hungry...
'Cause of time and chance
Don't it hurt so bad... Time...
And it hurt so bad... Chance...
(Don't it hurt)

I'm tryin to find the faith before the fall
A good man's down, while a bad man's standing tall
A strong man don't always, win 'em all
I'm going crazy, crazy, crazy, baby!

Don't it hurt so bad? (oh it really hurt so bad)
And it hurt so bad, (tell me can you feel the pain?)
Don't it hurt so bad (time and chance)
And it hurt so bad (so bad, so, so, bad)
(It really hurt so bad, no one can stand the pain, now is all about time and chance)

Time and chance... Don't it hurt so bad
So bad, so bad
Don't hurt so bad
And it hurt so bad...
