I still get the same old feeling
Tearing at this heart of mine
Telling me that maybe I'm
Not really over you
I still get the same old yearning
Turning my heart inside out
Love, there can't be any doubt
I'm still not over you

The oak tree where you carved my name
A year ago now
Somehow doesn't really look the same
I think it closed now
The places we would go
Still play the songs we used to know

I still get the same old feeling
Tearing at this heart of mine
Telling me that maybe I'm
Not really over you
I still get the same old yearning
Turning my heart inside out
Love, there can't be any doubt
I'm still not over you

The cottage where we used to meet
Is overgrown now
We dreamed we'd live there too someday
Just on our own now
The letters you wrote me
Still bring that sentimental ring

I still get the same old feeling
Tearing at this heart of mine
Telling me that maybe I'm
Not really over you
I still get the same old yearning
Turning my heart inside out
Love, there can't be any doubt
I'm still not over you
