I got a secret 
It's here in my heart
And I can't even tell my friends.
How much I adore you 
I'm fallin' apart 
I got to kept it deep within.
The way that I love you 
I can't even say I promise not to
Tell a soul
It won't last too long, a feeling so strong 
And I can't hide the way.

I can't hide the way I'm feeling inside
The pain is killing me 
'Cause I want to let the world know 
It's you I'm lovin'
I can't hide the way I'm feeling inside
The pain is killin me
'Cause I want to let the world know its you I'm lovin'.

It's something so special, this thing that we share
So why can't we just let it go 
It's easy to see 
Can they know that we should be as one. 
It's out in the open 
Our cover is blown and I don't care who really knows
I need to be with you 
Can't take it no more, cause baby i need you.

Lovin you feels so right, (lovin you feels so right) 
I don't want to have to live a lie (i don't want to lie)
The way you touch, the way you kiss drives me out of my mind
(I'll never love)
Boy I've never loved this way before baby
So I've given you the keys to my door 
With every touch I want you more 
Don't want to let my feelings show
I can't hide.

I can't hide the way I'm feeling inside
The pain is killing me 
'Cause I want to let the world know 
It's you I'm lovin'
I can't hide the way I'm feeling inside
The pain is killin me
'Cause I want to let the world know its you I'm lovin'.

I'm not afraid to let my feelings show 
I can't hide them no more (no More) 
'Cause no matter what they say 
It's never gone to change the way that I feel for you 
'Cause boy I love (I love you )

I can't hide the way I'm feeling inside
The pain is killing me 
'Cause I want to let the world know 
It's you I'm lovin'
I can't hide the way I'm feeling inside
The pain is killin me
'Cause I want to let the world know its you I'm lovin'.
