How does it feel out on the ice?
You speak to the crowd but nobody hears
It's not a dream and you are no prize
And you're not alone come in from the fear

Gonna take it back
Take back the life that you want to lead
Been under quiet attack
But now it's time for you and me
Gonna take it back
You've got to fight for what you believe
We're gonna make this stand
The finest hour that we see

When did our choice become erased?
Where is the violence in this crowd?
Now that our voice has been replaced
With a silence that screams out loud

Gonna take it back
Take back the life that you want to lead
Been under quiet attack
But now it's time for you and me
Gonna take it back
You've got to fight for what you believe
We're gonna make this stand
The finest hour that we see

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Gonna take it back
Take back the life that you want to lead
Been under quiet attack
But now it's time for you and me
Gonna take it back
You've got to fight for what you believe
We're gonna make this stand
The finest hour that we see

Yeah, the finest hour that we see
We're gonna make this stand
The Finest Hour that we see
Yeah -eah - eah -eah -eah
