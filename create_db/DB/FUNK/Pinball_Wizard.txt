Ever since I was a young boy,
I've played the silver ball.
From Soho down to Brighton
I must've played them all.
But I never seen anything like him
In any amusement hall...
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball!

He stands like a statue,
Becomes part of the machine.
Feeling all the bumpers,
Always playing clean.
He plays by intuition,
The digit counters fall.
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball!

He's a pinball wizard.
There has to be a twist.
A pinball wizard's got
Such a supple wrist.

How do you think he does it?
I don't know!
What makes him so good?

He ain't got no distractions,
Can't hear no buzzers and bells.
Don't see no lights a flashin',
Plays by sense of smell,
Always has a replay,
An' never tilts at all...
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball!

He's a pinball wizard.
There has to be a twist.
A pinball wizard's got
Such a supple wrist.

Even at my favorite table
He can beat my best.
His disciples lead him in
And he just does the rest.
He's got crazy flipper fingers,
Never seen him fall...
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball!!!
