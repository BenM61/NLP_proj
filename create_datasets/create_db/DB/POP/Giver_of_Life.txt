For what you value, for what you care,
Well it's a pressure situation
Life encountered from day today,
Uneasy feelings of uncertainty.
Back by the bywash, out in the open,
Floating down and around and through
A breath of air, the sound of light
Uplifting moments of emotion

The Giver of Life,
You are the Giver of Life.

For what you give now, for what you get
Well it's an endless spinning circle
There is no reason no right or wrong
Just a chord answering a call
Out on the inroads, back on the backtracks
Floating down and around and through
The cry of fire, the sway of soul
Uplifting moments of emotion

The Giver of Life,
You are the Giver of Life.

For what you count on for what you trust
Well it's a precious situation
Out in the cities, sold in the cellars
On the floor into the heart of clubland
The king of beat under the flashing lights
Uplifting moments of emotion

The Giver of Life,
The Giver of Life,
You are the Giver of Life.
