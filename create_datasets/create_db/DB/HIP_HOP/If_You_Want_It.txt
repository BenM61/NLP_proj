If you want it then I've got it
If you need it, baby, I'll feed it
If you love it, come and rub it
'Cause there's something
I should let you know, oh

You got a brother like me the gangster D
I got a nice piece of meat that'll fit you to the tee
So come with me and I'll let you see

Just jump out the pipes, don't feel no shame

I love me some hoe's, you know I got these young girls

I'll make you flip, have a fit
While I make you moan and kick
Lookie here, trick, now I'm holding JYB
But you don't need teeth, all you need is strong knees

If you need it, baby, I'll feed it
