Hey listen guys
Take this advice, and remember always in life,

Into each heart some tears must fall
And though we love and lose, we must stand tall
'Cause we all got to cry sometimes
I said, sigh sometimes
Pull yourself together
There's no use crying forever

Because there's too many fish in the sea
Too many fish in the sea
Well there's short ones, tall ones, fine ones, kind ones
Too many fish in the sea

My mother once told me something
And every word is true
Don't waste your time on a girl
Who does not love you
She'll only mislead you
Only grieve you
Don't worry about her
Just do without her

Because there's too many fish in the sea
Too many fish in the sea
Short ones, tall ones, fine ones, kind ones
Too many fish in the sea

Well, if the fish isn't on your line
Bait your hook and keep on trying
Well don't let her get you down
There's other girls around

Because there's too many fish in the sea
There's too many fish in the sea
There's short ones, tall ones, fine ones, kind ones
Too many fish in the sea

I don't want nobody that don't want me
'Cause there's too many fish in the sea
Ain't gonna love nobody that don't love me, now
Too many fish in the sea
I don't need nobody that don't need me
Too many fish in the sea
I don't want nobody that don't love me, now
Too many fish in the sea
I don't want nobody that don't want me
