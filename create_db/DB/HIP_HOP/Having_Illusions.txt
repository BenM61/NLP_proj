You were the only one, that I ever loved
And you promised you wouldn't break my heart
Oh please, tell me how could you do this to me?
Well, I've been having dreams of losing you
Then some how I don't know my dream came true
And I don't know if I could live alone

Oh, I can't believe you still love me baby
It's even impossible that you would even care
But I know I can't forget that you let me down
And I can't believe you broke my heart

I'm having illusions, I'm losing my mind
I can't sleep at night 'cause I can't have my baby tonight
Yeah baby, I'm losing my mind, I need you in my life

So tell me how's it feel to know you've done some wrong
To someone who was right for you
Oh, how could it be that you just don't love me no more, yeah
Well you've been telling everybody I wasn't you're type of guy
Well, you know that I am well but you were down

Oh, is it sick to think that you even love me
I've even had second thoughts that you even care
But I know I can't forget that you let me down
And I can't believe that you broke my heart

I'm having illusions, I'm losing my mind
I can't sleep at night cause I can't have my baby tonight
Yeah, baby I'm losing my mind, I need you in my life

I'm having illusions, I'm losing my mind
I can't figure out why my baby is out of my life
Yeah, baby I'm losing my mind, I need you in my life

Tell me, tell me why me?
Give me a reason why you had to leave
After all that we've been through
What did I ever do to lose you?

Well I'll just sit right here and cry
Because you know that I'd rather die
Than spend a day without you baby, I'm on my knees, I'm begging
God knows I need you, I need you, I need you, oh

I'm having illusions, I'm losing my mind
I can't sleep at night 'cause I can't have my baby tonight
Yeah baby, I'm losing my mind, I need you in my life

I'm having illusions, I'm losing my mind
I can't figure out why my baby is out of my life
Yeah, I'm losing my mind, I need you in my life

I'm having illusions, I can't sleep at night
Oh, said I need you baby, said I need you baby
Said I want you baby, I can't live without you
