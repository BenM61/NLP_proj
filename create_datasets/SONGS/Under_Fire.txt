I'm sentimental
I found a gentle
Lover ever coming my way
A continental, experimental
Acting of love I obey

Get the champagne (Going down)
My defenses (Slowing down)
Baby, see I'm under fire
He's reaching my desire

Oh
Can't you see I'm under fire
Never hears desire
Offering my heart on fire
You get me under, under, under, under
Fire, fire
Fire, fire

I'm in a safe seat
I never meant him to come along and tear me apart
While you were waiting and hesitating
Another man invaded my heart

I resisted (Go away)
He insisted (So you say)
Baby, now I'm under fire
He's reaching my desire

Oh
Can't you see I'm under fire
Never hears desire
Offering my heart on fire
You get me under fire

Get the champagne (Go-ooo-ing down)
My defenses (Slowing down)
Baby, see I'm under fire
He's reaching my desire

Oh
Can't you see I'm under fire
Never hears desire
Offering my heart on fire
You get me under, under, under, under
Fire, fire
Fire, fire
Fire, fire
Fire, fire
Fire, fire
Fire, fire
Fire, fire
