We can take it; we can make it
These streets can't be tougher than sea
Baltimore your potholes bore me
Can't you see you're acting poorly

Can we get a job, can we get a job
We need off this dock, is that asking a lot

Now I've seen it all before
When no one's opened up their door
How is one meant to survive when one is over-qualified
