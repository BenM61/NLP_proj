Step into the vibe, swing the episode, 
take it to the bridge, I want to take you out...(repeat)

Oh, I just get so excited baby,
think about a day with you and all the fun things that we can do,
and you make me feel so excited, lady,
and you ignite the spark that burns deep inside my heart...

All I want to do is spend time with you, we'll go on and on and on,
'til the break of dawn...
All I want to do is spend time with you, we'll go on and on and on,
'til the break of dawn...

We don't have to get sexual, baby,
I want to take walks in the park, and we'd wine and dine until it's dark...
I just want to be with you, girl,
and I'll cherish every moment as if it was the end of the world...

All I want to do is spend time with you, we'll go on and on and on,
'til the break of dawn...(on and on 'til the break of dawn)
All I want to do is spend time with you, we'll go on and on and on,
'til the break of dawn...(take it to the bridge)

Uh huh, step into the vibe, swing the episode,
take it to the bridge, I want to take you out...
Uh huh step into the vibe, swing the episode,

All I want to do is spend time with you, we'll go on and on and on,
'til the break of dawn...(repeat over)

All I want to do is spend time with you baby,
so we can go on 'til the break o' dawn...
I just want to make love to your mind, penetrating your inner soul...
And we can have a candlelight night, 
and as I whisper in your ears, you have no fears...
It's about time we get to each other, elevating our climax,
elevating our fantasies, G-you-Y2K, 2K, 2K..
