I see the rain fall on the river running to the seas again
I see the clouds are rolling over in the sky
While I'm waiting for the wind to kindly pick me up
And carry me home, carry me home

I see the summer turn to winter
And the winter turn to spring
I see the autumn leaves are falling down again
And I wonder if you've taken time to look around and see the light?
Well I'm counting stars tonight

Oh baby I believe, I believe
You're coming back for me, back for me
Love in emergency, rescue me
Oh baby I believe, I believe
Love in emergency

There's a siren that is calling out your name
And I can see your face reflected in the flame
And I get a funny feeling that the storm is coming down again
To bring you round again

Don't take your time hurry up!
I need this waiting to stop
Looking for a signal
Waiting for a sign
I see the light, I see the light

Oh baby I believe, I believe
You're coming back for me, back for me
Love in emergency, rescue me
Oh baby I believe, I believe
Oh baby I believe, I believe
You're coming back for me, back for me
Love in emergency, rescue me
Oh baby I believe, I believe

Love in emergency
Love in emergency
Love in emergency
Love in emergency

Love in emergency
You're coming back for me
Love in emergency
Oh baby I believe, I believe

Oh baby I believe, I believe
You're coming back for me, back for me
Love in emergency, rescue me
Oh baby I believe, I believe
Love in emergency
