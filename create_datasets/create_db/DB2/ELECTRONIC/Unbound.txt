When the night time is falling
I lay down content
And the morrow is calling
Stick to the present
Where my mind is a flowing
My body will follow
Must be some way of knowing

Nothing holds me back now
And I will be standing my ground
Luck will find me somehow
You know that I will be unbound

I want you to be
Out there with me
I need you to be
Unbound with me
I want you to be
Out there with me

And then why do I worry
Odds are with me
I'm upon my journey
Untied I will be

I have found what I came for
Why should I concern
Just a taste and I want more
I'm on a good turn
On a good turn

Nothing holds me back now
And I will be standing my ground
Luck will find me somehow
You know that I will be unbound

I want you to be
Out there with me
I need you to be
Unbound with me
I want you to be
Out there with me

And then you bring about
Open windows to jump through
Over to the other side
