"A" is for "Apple" 
"B" is for "Balloons" 
"C" is for "Crayons" 
"D" is for "Drum" 

Like my scrotum here it is in a nutshell 
One thousand nine hundred and seventy-two 
That's the year I got here when my dear mother's water blew 
Not really realizing the prize that's been begot to her 
The bona fide lo-fi high-octane philosopher 
Genius with a penis the few the proud the me 
I liked me so much I had to buy the company 
Soul for sale sold to Satan for a hell of a lotta luck 
I'm hard to come by like a straight guy working at Starbucks 
Thank the thinkers that think they thunk the thoughts that theorized 
Idolized or despised bet I'm gettin' recognized 
Mount Rushmore it? No ignore it can't rock with no big head 
Half of the people want me half of the people want me dead 
I am the Angel of Def with my rhymes against humanity 
Teeter-tottering between brilliance and insanity 
The one part the Fuehrer the one part the Pope 
It's the inevitable return baby of the Great White Dope 

Conclusions you drew proportions you blew 
Lost son of Iggy? False Bigger nose than Ziggy? True 
Yes my name is Jimmy Pop no my pop's name is Dick 
Don't admit to kick it slick you thick derelict critic 
Put down for missed notes put up with misquotes 
Don't want the whole story? Should have bought the Cliff Notes 
Like Fingerpainting 101 give me no credit for having class 
One thumb on the pulse of the nation one thumb in your girlfriend's ass 
Written on written off scoff callin' me a joke 
I don't think that I'm a sell-out but I do "Enjoy Coke!" 
I struck gold but never took it for granite that's how I planned it so can it 
Around the planet fans demand it and you'll never understand it 
When I die no lie plan on mass pandemonium 
They may display my brain in a pickle jar at the Smithsonian 
The one part the Fuehrer the one part the Pope 
It's the inevitable return baby of the Great White Dope 

One part the Fuehrer one part the Pope 
The inevitable return of the Great White Dope 
One part the Fuehrer one part the Pope 
The inevitable return of the Great White Dope 
One part the Fuehrer one part the Pope 
The inevitable return of the Great White Dope 
One part the Fuehrer one part the Pope 
The inevitable return of the Great White Dope 

Great White Dope 
Great White Dope 
Great White Dope 
Great White Dope
