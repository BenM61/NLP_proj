Everybody sees me
But it's not that easy
Standing in the life fields
Standing in the light fields
Waiting for some action
Waiting for some action over
Why won't you come over here?

Why won't you come over here?
We've got a city to love

Why won't you come over here?
We've got a city to love

Oh damn good years
?
I know you messed up
When I saw you

You're cold you're so cold
You're so cold you're so cold

Nobody can see me
Everything's too easy
Standing in the life field
Standing in the light field
Waiting for some action
Waiting for some action

She said why won't you come over here?

Why won't you come over here?
We've got a city to love

Why won't you come over here?
We've got a city to love

Oh down the soul

And I said set free
You never chose me
For a while it was nice
But it's time to say goodbye

Cold you're so cold
You're so cold you're so cold

No no no cold
You're so cold you're so cold you're so cold

Oh no no no no cold
You're so cold you're so cold you're so cold
No no you're so cold
