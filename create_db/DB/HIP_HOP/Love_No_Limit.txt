Baby, there's no need to tell ya
As far as I can clearly recall
My love has been here for you
So you don't have to worry at all
I'll sacrifice my time 
I'll make sure you're satisfied
And it's no hard thing to the joy I bring
I want to give you all my love

[Chorus]
Loving you 
(That's all I want to do)
Every day
(And every hour, baby)
Don't you look no more
Love without a limit
(My love is yours)
Loving you 
(That's all I want to do)
Every day
(And every minute, every hour, baby)
Don't you look no more
Love without a limit
(My love is yours)

Baby, I'm in need of your love
And you got that touch 
That I need so much
And I am about to explode
Freely, completely, everything you want I'll be
Good love down to the last drop
And I'm not gonna stop

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Loving you, is all I want to do
Loving you, is all I want to do
Loving you, said loving you
Is all that I, all that I want to do
Baby, baby, baby, hey

[Chorus: x3]
