Ba ba da da
Ba ba da da
Ba ba da da
Ba ba da da
Ba ba da da

Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (ba ba da da)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (ba ba da da, ba ba da da)

It's been some time since we last spoke
This is gonna sound like a bad joke
But, mama, I fell in love again
It's safe to say I have a new girlfriend

And I know it sounds so old
But Cupid got me in a choke hold
And I'm afraid I might give in
Towels on the mat, my white flag is wavin'

I mean, she even cooks me pancakes
And Alka-seltzer when my tummy aches
If that ain't love, then I don't know what love is

We even got a secret handshake
And she loves the music that my band makes
I know I'm young, but if I had to choose her or the sun
I'd be one nocturnal son of a gun

(ba ba da da, ba ba da da)

Take a look at my girlfriend

Not much of a girlfriend

It's been awhile since we talked last, and I'm tryin' hard not to talk fast
But, dad, I'm finally thinkin' I may have found the one
Type of girl that will make you way proud of your son

And I know you heard the last song
About the girls that didn't last long
But I promise this is on a whole new plane
I can tell by the way she says my name (ba ba da da)

I love the way she calls my phone
She even got her very own ring tone
If that ain't love, then I don't know what love is (ba ba da da)

It's gonna be a long drive home, but I know as soon as I arrive home
And I open the door, take off my coat, and throw my bag on the floor
She'll be back in my arms, into my arms once more for sure like
(ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba)

Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (ba ba da da)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (ba ba da da, ba ba da da)

She's got a smile that would make the most senile
Annoying old man bite his tongue
I'm not done
She's got eyes comparable to sunrise
And it doesn't stop there
Man, I swear
She's got porcelain skin; of course she's a ten
And now she's even got her own song
But movin' on
She's got the cutest laugh I ever heard
And we can be on the phone for three hours
Not sayin' one word
And I would still cherish every moment
And when I start to build my future, she's the main component
Call it dumb, call it luck, call it love, or whatever you call it, but
Everywhere I go, I keep her picture in my wallet like here

Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (ba ba da da)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (ba ba da da, ba ba da da)

Take a look at my girlfriend
