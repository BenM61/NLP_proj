When I look in your eyes I can see disgust
But it's not in me
It's all in yourself
Raise your fist and speak your voice

Grab your chest
Open your heart
Your emptiness
Oh my God
Let's go

Your emptiness that you have for yourself has made you weak
With every day and every breath always holding back
You try to hold on to the things that you won't fight to keep
Alive

Take my hand and slap my face
I can't believe this is what I see
Take my hand and slap my face
I can't believe this is what I see

Disgrace yourself and all that you love
And I say it again
So don't burden me

Don't burden me with your lack of trust in yourself
With your loss of words
Design your fate
