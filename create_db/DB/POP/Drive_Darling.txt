You close the door and start the motor
I roll the window down
I raise my hand and wave goodbye
To neighborhood queens and clowns and

Children in the front yards
They hide and seek and laugh
I can almost hear you thinking
How could these days go by so fast

And no rear view could picture
What we leave behind
Drive darling, drive darling,
Drive darling, drive darling, drive

A silent conversation
No words cause there's no need
We let the tapes mix up the years
And press repeat and press repeat

The trunk is filled with records
And books and tears and clothes
I'm smiling on the surface
I'm scared as hell below

And no rear view could picture
What we leave behind
Drive darling, drive darling,
Drive darling, drive darling, drive

Good morning freedom
Good night lullabies
Drive darling, drive darling,
Drive darling, drive darling, drive

And when we arrive
The hardest of goodbyes
You will dry my eyes
Somehow you're always by my side
The one who holds my kite
And watches over all my flights

Once, once that we arrive
The hardest of goodbyes
You will dry my eyes
Somehow you're always by my side
The one who holds my kite
And watches over all my flights

And no rear view could picture
What we leave behind
Drive darling, drive darling,
Drive darling, drive darling, drive
