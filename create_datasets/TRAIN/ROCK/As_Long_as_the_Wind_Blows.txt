From the Album:
* Golden Earring
How could I tell you that I loved you
You never gave me a chance
How could I know that you put me down
You had no reason, I'm on the ground
How could I know
That you were out of reach
Higher than any star, sparklin' in the blue sky
Why did you make me cry
I couldn't touch you
And I don't know why, I don't know why
You hurt my soul and lettin' me die
I don't know why, It's just another day to die
I sit down and cry
As long as the wind blows
As long as the wind howls
As long as the sea flows
I can't stop lovin' you
