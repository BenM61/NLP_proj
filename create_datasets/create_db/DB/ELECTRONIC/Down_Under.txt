The moon light is shown
I feel our walls are cracking
And were so close to fall
I hear the night is calling out
We are only what we feel
And turning into something real

Moonlight breaks the crack of dawn
Breaking us into seperate parts
On the sunslight is on
I feel our shadows fading
And were so far from home
I hear the morning calling out

We are only what we feel
Yearning for something real
The moonlight breaks the crack of dawn
Tweaking us into different parts

Whats that sound I hear down under
Is it your heart is it just thunder
Whats that sound I hear down under
Is it your heart is it just thunder
Is it your heart is it just thunder

And we are only what we feel
Yearning for something real
The moonlight breaks the crack of dawn
Tweaking us into different parts
