The lights were low enough, you guessed
You swapped your conscience with your fathers medication
Limped from Rome to Lawrenceville
And on the way wrote out a self-made declaration

And when you got to Pleasant Hill
You forced the traffic to erase your family demons
And made a pact with you and God
If you don't move I swear to you I'm gonna make ya

Do you need me?
Do you need me?
Do you need me?
Do you need me?

When the first officer arrived
It happened to be the high school bully of your brother
When you finally recognized
You felt some guilt that you had even let him touch you

Can you hear me? What's your name?
You could not speak just laid amazed at all the damage
And as the high school's letting out
All the kids saying the same thing that they used to

It's an alien
It's an alien
It's an alien
It's an alien

The lights are low enough, you guessed
Hospital food, there's never enough medication
The doctor asked about your ears
You said your mom said you were made from a revelation

The revelation never scares
If you came from your drunken dad and a pair of scissors
You just finally letting go?
Did you mean to take out all those people with you?

Didn't mean to
Didn't mean to
Didn't mean to
Didn't mean to

Oh I didn't mean to (Oh I didn't take the time to learn to let you go)
Oh I didn't mean to (Never letting go)
No I didn't mean to (Oh I didn't take the time to learn to let you go)
Oh I didn't mean to (Never letting go)

Time is here to take your last amendments and believe them on your own
Time is here to take you by the hand and leave you there alone
Time has come to take the last commandment and to carve it into stone
Time has come to take you by the hand and leave you here alone
