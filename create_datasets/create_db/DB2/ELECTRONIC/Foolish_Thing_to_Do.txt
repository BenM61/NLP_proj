I was thinking just the other day
How it started in such a strange way
It ended in a strange way too
And this is why I am singing this song for you

It's a foolish thing to do
Such a foolish thing to do
Give your heart to someone new
It's a foolish thing to do
(yeah)

We've all made the same mistakes
One foolish glance one smile we made
A hundred thousand feel this way
While other people are just waiting for the day

It's a foolish thing to do
Such a foolish foolish thing to do
Go when you want it
When you need it
Don't just believe it
For the first an last time
Stop !
You'd better look around
One day you'll walk into the room
Your eyes will meet
You'll fall in love too soon
The next time you might hesitate
The chance is all those rooms have eyes
So don't forget

It's a foolish thing to do
Such a such a foolish thing to do
To go and give your heart and soul to someone new
It's a foolish foolish thing to do
So when you feel it
When you can touch it
And you believe it
For the first an last time
Stop !
You'd better look around
It's a foolish thing to do
Such a foolish thing to do
