[Rap: ]
The boys 
We're just chillin' with Earth, Wind & Fire 
This is my desire 
Talking 'bout culture 
I'm a vulture 
Just like the beat 

Chillin' with Earth, Wind & Fire 

Everybody take a look around 
What do you see 
When I look 
There's faces everywhere 
Lookin' back at me 
Their eyes keep telling me stories 
Don't understand 
In my mind 
There's many, many questions 
'Bout who I am 

Bridge: 
Just be proud of the land 
Where your blood comes from 
No one can take away 
What you have done 
Hold your head up high 
Cultures stand eye to eye 
One people living under one sun 

Chorus: 
Be proud 
Sing it out loud 
Take your rightful place 
It's you heritage 
So stand tall 
Don't be small 
Show true face 
It's your heritage 

Everybody walks a little different 
To keep the pace 
Gotta have pride 
Just to be a winner 
In the human race 
In school, the rules don't fly 
Out on the street, tell me why 
People of the nation can't feel the same beat 

Bridge 

Chorus 

Bridge: 
We're living in a colorful world 
All shades of love 
Each carrying a ray of hope 
Sent down from above 

[Rap: ]
Yo Maricem break it down for me, all right 
The Boys chillin' wit Earth, Wind and Flames 
They asked us to sing a few notes 
So we came 
Realized the meaning of the song 
So we sung 
With all our heart and soul 
And hopefully we brung 
A message to all 
To not be small 
To stand up tall 
And to give it your all 
Let's have a ball y'all 
Pump it up!
