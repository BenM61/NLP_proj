Can you hear the wind blow?
Can you hear it
Callin' your name?
You don't want to go slow

You just want to tell me
I'm to blame
About to lose my patience
You just want to push me
To the flame

I'm gonna build a big fence
And I want you to know
It's a cryin' shame
I just want to talk to you 
But all you want to do is

Take it out on me
(Tell me how you really feel)
Take it out on me
(Tell me are you real)
Take it out on me

I don't want to hear you say that you're reckless
I don't want to hear it anymore
I pray to God, to give you strength because you're faithless
But all you want to do
All you want to do 
Is take it out on me

Now listen to me, brother
Can you hear my voice out in the rain
You think about no other
I can see your life is filled with pain
I see you on the pages 
Of the weekly Hollywood Gazette
But still your soul it rages
How can you judge my life when you haven't lived yet?
