She walking so fast, she walking so fast, she walking so fast
Oh our lady she don't know how she go
She walking so fast, she walking so fast, she walk like a babe, hey
Her image it lasts and I know,
She floats along as she goes
She owns the eyes as she flies right through the sound
Moving her body all around town
Hey, hey mami, hey, hey mami
I know what you want, I know what you want, I know what you want
Sooner or later the dudes at bodegas will hold their lips and own this shit
Curlin' their toes on a shivery tip
But out here oh she don't know the gravity she owns
As she pulls on the eyeballs of all the kids standing tall

Look at that ass and I know

She owns the eyes as she flies right through the sound
Moving her body all around town
