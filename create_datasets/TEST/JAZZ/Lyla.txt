Calling all the stars to fall
And catch the silver sunlight in your hands
Come for me and set me free
Lift me up and take me where I stand

She believes in everything
And everyone and you and yours and mine
I've waited for a thousand years
For you to come and blow me out my mind

Hey, Lyla! 
The stars are about to fall
So what d'you say, Lyla?
The world around us makes me feel so small, Lyla! 
If you can't hear me call then I can't say, Lyla! 
Heaven'll help you catch me if I fall! 

She's the queen of all I've seen
And every song and city far and near
Heaven help my mademoiselle, 
She rings the bell for all the world to hear

Hey, Lyla! 
The stars are about to fall
So what d'you say, Lyla?
The world around us makes me feel so small, Lyla! 
If you can't hear me call then I can't say, Lyla! 
Heaven'll help you catch me if I fall! 

Hey, Lyla
