I'm falling like a star, and I'm holding on for dear life
I'm about to reach the ground
I'm coming home to Earth
I've reached my town

And they said that you couldn't sit on a cloud, cause you'd fall right through
Well how is it then, that I managed to?
And how did I say what I just said to you?
Am I thinking out loud, did you even ask me to?

I'm falling like a star, and I'm holding on for dear life
I'm about to reach the ground
I'm coming home to Earth
I've reached my town

And the streets are empty how, but for the wrong reasons
They've all gone and left me alone
And they left with a vengance, and they talk of their experience
And they'll try and convince me, to join them

Holy, Holy
Holy is the only word I know these days
Holy, Holy
Holy is the only word I know these days

Those flowers have never experienced anything like this before
They've been picked from their wilderness, put in a jar
Now they're feeling the heat of this room

And I'm falling like a star, and I'm holding on for dear life
I'm about to reach the ground
I'm coming home to Earth
I've reached my town

Falling like a star
I only came down for a day, I didn't want to stay
Falling like a star
I only came down for a day, I didn't want to stay
