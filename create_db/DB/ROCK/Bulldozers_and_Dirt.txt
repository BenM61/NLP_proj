I met your mama when I was sixteen
You couldn't have been anymore than three
She caught me stealing y'all's color TV
She called the cops and they arrested me

She was the wildest thing I'd ever seen
The way she pointed that shotgun at me
The police hauled my ass off to jail
Your mama signed the trailer to help make the bail

She picked me up and drove me home
Said I'll learn you not to roam?
Green green grass under my feet
But all I can think about's the dirt underneath

Bulldozers and dirt Bulldozers and dirt
Behind the trailer, my desert
Them red clay piles are heaven on earth
I get my rocks off, bulldozers and dirt

I got a pickup that's up on blocks
And I'm up to my ass in debt and hock
And I can't get the red stains off of my socks
And I can't get you off of my mind

I've lived with your mama for eleven years
Through good times, and bad times, fist fights and tears
But something comes over me when you come near
So won't you come over and sip on this beer

Bulldozers and dirt bulldozers and dirt
Behind the trailer, my desert
I don't mean no harm, I just like to flirt
But most of all I like bulldozers and dirt

Most of all I like bulldozers and dirt
