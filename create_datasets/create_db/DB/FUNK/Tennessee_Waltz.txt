Well, I was dancin' with my baby to the Tennessee Waltz
When that old friend I happened, I happened to see, oh yeah
I introduced him to my baby
And while they were dancin'
My friend stole my sweetheart away from me
Oh, yes he did

But I remember the night and that beautiful Tennessee Waltz
Only you know know how much I've lost, oh yeah
You know that I lost my lost my baby
That night they kept playing
That beautiful Tennessee Waltz, oh yeah

I was dancin' with my baby to that Tenne-Tennessee Waltz
When that old friend I happened, I happened to see, oh yeah
Introduced him to my baby
While while they were dancin'
Dirty dog stole my baby, 'way from me, oh, yeah

But I remember that night and that beautiful Tennessee Waltz
Only you know just how much how much I have lost, oh yeah
You know that I lost my, lost my baby
That night they kept on playing
That beautiful
That wonderful
That marvelous
That glorious
That beautiful Tennessee Waltz
