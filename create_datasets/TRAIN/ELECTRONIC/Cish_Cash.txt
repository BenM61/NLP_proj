Yo yo yo yo

Miss that so you want to kick that
All messed up and that's a fact
If you want to risk that do that
Yo yo yo

Guess it's time for pay back
So you want your cish cash
Owe it all to splish splash
So mish mash you 'spect to go go go
Yo yo yo yo

You want it, you take it 
You take it, you got it 
You want it, you take it 
You're insatiable! 

It's not enough you want more of it 
It's not enough must have all of it 
Overflowing on overkill 
All the hands are out for their pound of flesh 

It makes the world spin round and round 
The hands are out for their bloody pound 
Overflowing on overkill 
Sticky licky yummy yummy 
Dipping in the milk and honey 

You want it, you take it 
You take it, you got it 
You want it, you take it 
You're insatiable! 

They say it makes the world spin round 

It's not enough you want more of it 
It's not enough must have all of it 
Overflowing on overkill 
All the hands are out for their pound of flesh 

It makes the world spin round and round 
The hands are out for their bloody pound 
Overflowing on overkill 
Sticky licky yummy yummy 
Dipping in the milk and honey 

You want it, you take it 
You take it, you got it 
You want it, you take it 
You're insatiable!
