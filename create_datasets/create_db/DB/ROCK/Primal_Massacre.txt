Warmongers, a race of total genocide 
Domination, a crusade to clean the world from lies 
The stench of Christians, screaming, burning, dying 
A world in chaos where evil germinates 

An impenitent world evil grows 
A world in putrefaction where malice takes command 
Like a cloud that consumes all hope 
A world in darkness where all good will die 

Retribution 
Reborn chaos 
Eternal death 

Profane their world of lies 
Primal massacre into the end 
Disgrace their sacrifice 

End of days originating from lies 
The final judgement falls upon 
Burn forever Jesus Christ 

Illusion of the future, already a dying past 
Light becomes darkness, pain becomes all 
No more resistance, a growing fear of death 
Scream for mercy, when everything dies 

Retribution 
Reborn chaos 
Eternal death
