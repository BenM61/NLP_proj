Years go by and I miss you
I can't describe what you've been through
But you're gone
We do what we believe in
Set a goal and stop dreaming
I'm not saying you're wrong

But every time you're going and I'm asking myself why
Hoping, oh just hoping you won't go oh oh
I know you're proud of me your're
Holding your head high
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK

It's OK 'cause I know I'll get you back
Though I know your mind is criminal
It don't matter, no
That you're going in again
I know I'll get you back
Though I know your mind is criminal
I got women for you man
When you're coming out again

You know I could have been with you
Been with you, done what you been through
I had a chance to choose
When enough's enough will you know it
When you reach your goal will you hold it
I'm afraid you're gonna lose

But every time you're going, I'm asking myself why
Hoping, oh just hoping you won't go oh oh
I know you're proud of me you're holding your head high
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK

It's OK 'cause I know I'll get you back
Though I know your mind is criminal
It don't matter no
I bet you're going in again
I know I'll get you back
Though I know your mind is criminal
I got women for you man
When you're coming out again

I know I'll get you back
A criminal, a criminal

I know I'll get you back
A criminal, a criminal

I know I'll get you back
A criminal, a criminal

I know I'll get you back
A criminal, a criminal
