I really want you
I really want you

Many Prophets preach on bended knees
Many clerics wasted wine, 
Do the bloody sheets and those troubled streets mean?
I have wasted time,

Are there silver shores on paradise?
Can I come in from the cold?
I killed a man in a far away land
My enemy untold

I really want you to really want me
But I really don?t know if you can do that (really want you)
I know you want to know what?s right
But I know so hard for you to do that (really want you)
Time's running out as it often does
And often dictates that you can't do that (really want you)
Fate can't break this feeling inside 
That's burning up through my veins...

I really want you
I really want you
I really want you
Now...

No matter what I say or do
The message isn?t getting through
And you?re listening to the sound
Of my breaking heart

I really want you 
I really want you 

Is a poor man rich in solitude?
Or when mother earth complained
Did the beggar pray for a sunny day but
Lady luck for rain

They say a million people bow and scream 
To an effigy of gold
As so life begin
And the ship we're in 
And history unfold

I really want you to really want me
But I really don?t know if you can do that (really want you)
I know you want to know what?s right
But I know so hard for you to do that (really want you)
Time's running out as it often does
And often dictates that you can't do that (really want you)
Fate can't break this feeling inside 
That's burning up through my veins...

I really want you
I really want you
I really want you
Now...

No matter what I say or do
The message isn?t getting through
And you?re listening to the sound
Of my breaking heart

I really want you 
I really want you 
I really want you
