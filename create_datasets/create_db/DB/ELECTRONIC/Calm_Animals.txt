Calm animals expect nothing
Live suspicious to balance out
The effect of reason on their sunrise
There's a moving hide
Calm animals with no shackles
Free on a shrinking plain
So presented; it's economics
Small wonder the pastures die
Calm, calm, calm, calm animals
Free on a shrinking plain
Calm, calm, calm
Adventures to roam alone
So civilized, the code stifles
A race with gestures has lost its way
The chance was given to think social
But we choke on greed and excess
Going by going by
Just for politics we live the lie
You cry, we cry
Part of history will wonder why
