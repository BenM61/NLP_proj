I gotta listen to the echo
Cause it seems like there's someone
Someone listening 
I gotta pay a close attention,
To what's out there in the distance

So, we've listened to the echoes (the echoes)
Have you think it would bring us closer

Where at you now?!
But we're landlocked, yeah we're landlocked
It last long but it's a long life
It's like a cruel tide,
It will pull you out

Now we look at these projections
(Concentrated far of fear)
We pretend that it's the real thing
(And the things outside of me)
And we think it's on the runway, but
That we can take off a far place

Where at you now?!
But we're landlocked, yeah we're landlocked
It last long, but it's a long life
It's like a cruel tide,
It will pull you out

Landlocked
Landlocked
Landlocked
Landlocked
Landlocked

So run for the coast line
No, we're landlocked 'til the end of time
It last long as it's a long life
It's like a cruel tide,
It will pull you out
