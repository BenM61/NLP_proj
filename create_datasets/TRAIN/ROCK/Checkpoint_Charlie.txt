Checkpoint Charlie
Walls so wide, can't get around it
Walls so high, can't climb over
Gotta come down

Checkpoint Charlie
Brothers and sisters on the other side
Livin' in the shadow of a wall so high
Make me wanna cry

I know that someday we'll be together
If we really want it
Nothin' that hurts gonna last forever
Why do we let it happen
Or is it that we don't mind
Somebody bein' punished for their fathers' crimes
