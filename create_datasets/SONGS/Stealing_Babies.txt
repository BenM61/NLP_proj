I'm teething on the answers you're saving
How ya gonna make me sleep again
While I'm dreaming you're stealing babies
When ya gonna to make me understand
Why? How should I say I'm so sorry
How should I pray to know that we're alive

Eve stands alone
By the knock on the door
By the thin in her bones
She's courageous and loving
Exhausted and cold
She's not ready to go
So the ghost on the phone
Helps her safely to her dream

You're leaving pieces of family
How ya gonna help them understand
While I'm screaming you're stealing babies
Why you want to knock us down again 
Why? How should I say I'm so sorry
How should we pray and make us feel alive

Eve stands alone
By the knock on the door
By the thin in her bones
She's courageous and loving
Exhausted and cold
She's not ready to go
So the ghost on the phone
Helps her safely to her dream

It must be our egos
It must be my lack of faith that it might not comeback

I've been waiting again
I've waited again
I've been waiting again
I've waited
