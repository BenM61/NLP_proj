Everybody loves my baby
but my baby don't love nobody but me
nobody but me
Yes
everybody wants my baby
but my baby don't want nobody but me
that's plain to see!

I'm his sweet Judy
and he is my loving man!
No time to do his duty
loves me like no other can!

Everybody loves my baby
but my baby don't love nobody but me
nobody but me
Everybody wants my baby
but my baby don't want nobody but me
that's plain to see!

Now when my baby kisses me
upon my rosy cheeks -
I just let those kisses be
don't wash my face for weeks!

Everybody loves my baby...
