Christmas time comes but once a year
Oh I'm so happy
My kids are happy too

It's take the next six months to pay my bills
When I think about it folks it gives me chills
But I don't care cause Christmas comes but once a year

I'm gettin' ready people
To have myself a ball
Im going out partying
Gonna dance to every call
I'm gonna think about new years day
I don't care what i have to pay
Let the good times roll
Cause Christmas comes but once a year
