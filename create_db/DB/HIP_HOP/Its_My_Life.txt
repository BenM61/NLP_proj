I rap about whats real, and what i go thru on the daily, its crazy, like my neighborhood back in the 80's, ive seen shit, ive lived it, i kno it, so i give it, i cant stop, and i wont stop until i finish, in the 90's u could find me on Hernandez with my homeboys, lookin out for the Chota, livin la vida loca, within my pockets some one always had a foosca, u kno how it is, u rollin thru u get thucha, bullets flyin i aint liyng i got hit by one, hefita cryed, i almost died, and it was just for fun, were never doin what we aughta be, rest in peace to my homeboy PeeWee, who got shot by a cop in a robery, and honestly that part of our lifestyle isnt suitable, dont act like you dont kno how it feels to go to a funeral,(silencio), thats how were livin though, and then  we wonder why they look at us like were some fuckin criminals u kno,

I get the smallest wires, and wrap them with the smallest tires, blaze more trees than the San Deigo wild fires, i get higher to inspire rhymes, say some shit to inquire minds, and make sure they admire mine,  make em' wonder what the f*ck goes on  in this mind of mine, im a kool dude that could blow up for the final time, its all the same aint nothin changed, its still the style of mine, neighborhood music talkin about how we do shit, we cruz it, we some times loose it and act foolish, but who doesnt, cause a ruckus, f*ck it thats what ur stuck with, products of the barrio, got no where to go, but we gotta go, if they ask me where im going shit I dont kno, around the town, see whos around, see whos down to get a 12 pack and bounce, im looking for the answer at the bottom of a bottle, its just my luck, i got no luck no california lotto
