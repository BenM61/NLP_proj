I'ma comin' in on the stellar 'surgence
With all my love, I overflow the river Nile
Rolling on for thousands of miles

We can celebrate your helical risin'
Ooh, we can activate your Christ seeds, too
Oh, It'll be fun

I don't want to wake up with a beautiful stranger
A Canis Major star
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
A major star

And when you feel the heat that licks at the street
On dog day afternoons
That's my sweet tongue
In search for you

I inherited the spirit of the Sun
I'll meet you when the day breaks through
It's time to shine
And make all your dreams come true

Come on
Wish upon a dog star
