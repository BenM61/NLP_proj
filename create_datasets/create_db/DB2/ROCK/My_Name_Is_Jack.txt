My name is Jack
And I live in the back of the Greta Garbo home
With friends I will remember
Wherever I will roam
And my name is Jack
And I live in the back of the Greta Garbo home for wayward boys and girls
We all love Jack and we live 

There goes Fred with his hands on his head
'cause he thinks he heard the bomb
And here comes Superman
Who really puts it on.

There's lots of fun
And I love to run up and down the stairs
I make as much noise as I want
And no one ever cares.

And my name is Jack 
We all love Jack 

Carl over there with his funny old hair
And he's never sad at all
And when he I grow up I want to run
As fast as my friend Paul.

There's the prettiest girl in the whole wide world
And her name is Melody Mend
And here comes Ma with Brother Tom
Who's probably my best friend.

And my name is Jack 
We all love Jack
