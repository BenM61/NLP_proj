Sanity serves no point of view
There is a way to redefining every move
I know you want me, you want me but it's just pointless
This is no ordinary madness
What can I do to fill the want to see you
What can I do if you're the one to leave
And I'm falling down again

'Cause when I'm with you
I can see the sun
I can feel the whole thing
When I'm with you
I can feel the sun
Orbiting around me

How can I move forward, when we're moving all the time
The next I hit the bottom and keep coming down

What else can I do
Now I have seen the whole thing

Clarity show the sober truth
The impossibility
Now I'm cutting you loose
I know you see me, you see me but I'm still blinded
This is no ordinary madness
What can I do to fill the want to see you
What can I if you're the one to leave
And I'm falling down again

'Cause when I'm with you
I can see the sun
I can feel the whole thing
When I'm with you
I can feel the sun
Orbiting around me

How can I move forward, when we're moving all the time
The next I hit the bottom and keep coming down

What else can I do
Now I have seen the whole thing

Let me breathe your air if I live
Let me breathe you in, let me start this thing
'Cause I can't stop it
Gravity can't ground us, I know
You are some sweet vertigo
This is madness or love

What can I do to fill the want to see you
What can I if you're the one to leave
And I'm falling down again
