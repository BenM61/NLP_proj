I can be the only girl for you
Wanna hold you closer
Can I take you home?
I wanna be the one to hold you 
closer than no one has ever done before

Some call it pain
Some call it torture
Maybe I enjoy it
Please come home
I swear I love you dearly
No one can hold you closer
Please come home

Honestly, sometimes I get scared
Lost in my own mind, trying to find my self
In the middle of this contagious world
I reached inside our mother's womb to find a piece of you
Recently I've been crying, crying
There's a pain deep inside, but I'm trying not to lose my
Only baby girl to a toxic world
I crawled back in our mother's womb to find a piece of you

I can be the only girl for you
Wanna hold you closer
Can I take you home?
I wanna be the one to hold you 
closer than no one has ever done before

Some call it pain
Some call it torture
Lately I enjoy it
Baby, please come home
I swear I'll love you dearly
No one can hold you closer
Please come home
