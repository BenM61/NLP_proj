The clouds come-a creepin' and you got me weepin' this moment
I can't believe your really gonna leave this town
everyone knows, I can't make a move with you
your turnin' my whole world, upside-down
and I get a feelin' that I've seen the last of you, Rio De Janeior Blue

The salty air, your wind-blown hair, reflection on a dream
thoughts of you with who knows who, flowin' through me like a stream
Brazilian serenades, linger on
help me lose my soul, in your song
and I get a feelin', that I've seen that last of you, Rio De Janeiro Blue,
Rio De Janeiro Blue

(Insturmental Bridge)

Months go by, I wounder why, I'm left here on my own
could it be my destiny, is to live this life alone
these dark and rainy days have turned me cold
long and sleepless nights, gettin' on
and I get a feelin' that I've seen the last of you, Rio De Janeiro Blue,
Rio De Janeiro Blue

Rio.... Rio, De Janeiro Blue
Long and sleepless nights, gettin' on
Rio......... Rio
