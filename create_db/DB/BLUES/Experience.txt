I learned half of what I know
From the worst teacher goin'
Experience
That school's too slow
An' I know folks
Smart ones from the city
Who gone and made a life's work
And a decade later
they still do it shitty
Experience

That's experience for ya
Moves kinda slow
You get off the bus
The same guy that got on 20 years ago
And as I feel it
Is it art or imitating?
'Cause if it's art
Then all my life's been finger painting
Had my best luck, though

With a big easel
I'd rather be an art project, babe
Than just weasel out with wearin' one
And come to suspect the whole experience
Experience, I think I understand
Is it like doin' 90
Her top's down
An' wind's in your beer can
That single moment on a bungee jump
You're down goin' down
You're comin' up now

I think I felt that before
It was kind of an experience
One shining moment lost in time
The one with the showroom shine
Well, I'm sorry girl
Yes, I'm sorry boy
But I feel that way all the time
Till I finally made it
Life was kinda hit or miss
But after I made it

Life was "Take a hit of this"
And I'd love to talk philosophy
But I've gotta take a piss
Man, that philosophy runs right through ya
Take it from me baby
I've got experience
All right

Experience, Do I understand
Is it like doin' a hundred
Her top's down
An' wind's in your beer can
That single moment, babe, on a bungee jump
You're down goin' down
You're comin' up now
Don't look down
That special moment lost in time
The one with the showroom shine
I'm sorry babe
Yes, I'm sorry babe
But I feel that way all the time
