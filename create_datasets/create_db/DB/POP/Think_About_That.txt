Mm, hmm
Yeah, yeah

I've carried this load for way too long
I couldn't let you go, under a spell of don't, don't, don't

Ego reaction
Guess I was holding up face
By saving your ass
You spent my money and I lost their faith

I scream yes, you told me nah
You fed me fear, I spoke to God
I was living my dreams through your eyes
Building my life on your lies, yeah
You just laughed when I cried

Think about that
Who lives the real sacrifice?
Think about that
Think about that
Think about
Think about that, whoa

All you disturb is my work and my patience
Years of grinding, you took it and broke it
All 'cause you're faking
You wanna be famous
Say it, you wanna be famous

Use all my juice, was thirsty as f*ck, always late, always faded

I scream yes, you told me nah
You fed me fear, I spoke to God
I was living my dreams through your eyes
Building my life on your lies, yeah
You just laughed when I cried

Think about that
Who lives the real sacrifice?
Think about that
Think about that, huh
Think about
Think about that
Think about that

Think about that
Think about that time when you blamed me
Think about that time I called you up and I said I needed saving
Think about that time when you said you cared
You were lying, tryin' to face me
Think about that time when I got sick and you made me go on stage
Think about that time when you used my fame to stack up on your paper
Think about that time you told my label lies, you said, "She's crazy"
Think about the fact they see it now
You're a shark, a cheat, a traitor (shark, a cheat, a traitor)

Think about that
Think about that
Think about (hey)
Think about that
Think about that
Think about that
Yeah, think about that
