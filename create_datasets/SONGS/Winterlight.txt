Hearts fall
Hearts call
Swallowed in the rain
Who knows
Life grows
Hollow and so vain
Wandering in the winter light
The wicked and the sane
Bare witness to salvation
And life starts over again

Now the clear sky is all around you
Aah, aah
Love's shadow will surround you
All through the night
Star glowing in the twilight
Tell me true
Hope whispers and I will follow
'Till you love me too
Ah

Now the clear sky is all around you
Aah,aah
Love's shadow will surround you
All through the night
Star glowing in the twilight
Tell me true
Hope whispers and I will follow
'Till you love me too
Ah
