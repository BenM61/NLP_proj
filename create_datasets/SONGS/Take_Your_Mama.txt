When you grow up, livin' like a good boy oughta
And your mama, takes a shine to her best son
Something different, all the girls they seem to like you
Cause you're handsome, like to talk and a whole lot of fun

But now your girl's gone a missin'
And your house has got an empty bed
The folks'll wonder 'bout the wedding
They won't listen to a word you said

Gonna take your mama out all night
Yeah we'll show her what it's all about
We'll get her jacked up on some cheap champagne
We'll let the good times all roll out
And if the music ain't good, well it's just too bad
We're gonna sing along no matter what
Because the dancers don't mind at the New Orleans
If you tip 'em and they make a cut

Do it 
Take your mama out all night
So she'll have no doubt that we're doing oh the best we can
We're gonna do it
Take your mama out all night
You can stay up late 'cause baby you're a full grown man

It's a struggle, livin' like a good boy oughta
In the summer, watchin' all the girls pass by
When your mama, heard the way that you'd been talking
I tried to tell you, that all she'd want to do is cry

Now we end up takin' the long way home
Lookin' overdressed wearin' buckets of stale cologne
It's so hard to see streets on a country road
When your glasses in the garbage
And your Continental's just got towed
