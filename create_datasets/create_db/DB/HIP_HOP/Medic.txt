Blue star, when I am blue
All I do is look at you
For I seem to find peace of mind
And I never get lonely
When you shine from afar

With you way up there
I don't dare to have a care
For I want to show that your glow
Lets me know that you know
That I'm not blue, blue star

With you way up there
I don't dare to have a care
For I want to show that your glow
Lets me know that you know
That I'm not blue, blue star
