I hope this terrifies you
Immoral suicide which burns inside you
I'll never let you out
Until you realize, knee deep 
Or buried alive in lies

Go, go, go believe
In everything you need
Take everything for granted
Distorting every memory
Knee deep and alone
You like it when you know 
Just what I'm thinking

I hope this terrifies you
Immoral suicide which burns inside you
Ill never let you out
Until you realize knee deep or buried alive in lies
This time I won't let you in

Sweet like a child
Act like children
You run from your problems
Blurring the visions we set in our sides
(So what would you like)
Straight

The kids are screaming at the tops of their lungs
While they are pointing their fingers at your loaded guns
Behind the places and backdrops
Firing explosives
Bridges are burning, we all fall down
We all fall down
We all fall down
We all fall down
We all fall down

I hope this terrifies you
I know it terrifies you
Ill be okay just go just go
We all fall down
I'll be okay
Let the bridges burn
We all fall down
