Flat a mile on the stairs to his worth
A proud father leading the search 
One mistake and a slip of the tongue and it 
Slipped to the question

Face it out
Face it out

Come right through assault gun 
But you better be right you better be right
This time I was hoping that you better be right

Back there where you live in a dream, your mindset becomes you
Fake fables are not all that they seem, mistrust within you
Can't say you believe in all that
After the things that you saw in the past
No bolt will be colder the shoulder
I'm here don't box me in

Face it out 
Face it out

Come right through assault gun 
But you better be right you better be right
This time I was hoping that you better be right

Come right through assault gun 
But you better be right you better be right
This time I was hoping that you better be right

This is a declaration 
Put my head in the sand
I feel it fill me in
Oh oh oh
I feel it fill me inn

Come right through assault gun 
But you better be right you better be right
This time I was hoping that you better be right

Come right through assault gun 
But you better be right you better be right
This time I was hoping that you better be right
