And I'll be the train
That keeps on rollin'
Up up around the bend
I'll be the voice that you hear callin'
Howlin' on the wind
I'll be the river deep
Runnin' through your sleep
And I'll be the hand
That keeps on a-knockin'
Up up against your door
I'll be the promise never broken
O forever more
Every vow I make
O I won't forsake

'Cause I'm gonna be
The keeper of the flame
You won't forget my name
Long as our love is in the rain
Wait and see I'm gonna be
The keeper of the flame
Someday you'll know my name
Long as our love is in the rain
Wait and see
O I'm gonna be
The keeper of the flame

Don't give me money money money
It'll lead my soul astray
I just want to be inside your temple
Each and every day
When you lay down your head
I will be your bed
And I'll be the heart
That keeps on a-beatin'
Hard up against your skin
I'll be the bulldozer pushin'
'Til you let me in
And when the sun goes down
I will be around

'Cause I'm gonna be
The keeper of the flame
You won't forget my name
Long as our love is in the rain
Wait and see I'm gonna be
The keeper of the flame
Someday you'll know my name
Long as our love is in the rain
Wait and see
O I'm gonna be
The keeper of the flame

To get what I wanna get
I'll be the red red wine
Going straight to your head

And I'll be the train
That keeps on rollin'
Up up around the bend
I'll be the horse that keeps on rockin'
This ride will never end
O when the sun goes down
I will be around

'Cause I'm gonna be
The keeper of the flame
You won't forget my name
Long as our love is in the rain
Wait and see I'm gonna be
The keeper of the flame
Someday you'll know my name
Long as our love is in the rain
Come lean on me 'cause I wanna be
The keeper of the flame
I won't ever let it fade
Long as our love is in the rain
I want you to call out my name
And wait and see
O I'm gonna be
The Keeper Of The Flame
