The nighttime filled with the cold winter chill
The rain is music on my window sill
The days are short, the nights are long
Won't someone show me where I belong?
I turn around when you walk by
You're just the kind of thing to catch my eye
I come up fast, I go down slow
So tell me darlin'? Do you want to go

(Let's go)
Slow dancing in the moonlight
(Let's go)
Want to slow dance with you all night
