I'd like to ask you from the start
If you could pull me out of the dark.
Or if our love could fall apart like cookies crumble.
See, I'm a demon on the loose.
I'm like an engine with no caboose.
And I need somebody who can really handle me.
Yeah, baby, I'm a wild one.
Don't let me run.
Don't let me get away.
Yeah, baby, I'm a wild, wild one.
Yeah, baby, I'm a wild one.
