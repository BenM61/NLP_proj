It's obvious, that you got it goin on
And I'm contemplating
I'm curious, it you mean what you say when you say it
And if you're serious about what you want to do
'Cause I have to be honest with you
I'm not into you
Casanovas, telling me what I want to hear
Just so they can get over
And after they get what they want, they're done
But I been there and done that
But you don't really seem like that
You're just so cool, and it just seems

[Chorus:]
Too good to be true
What you say what you do
So I gotta be careful
Don't want to fall too soon
And if I come across sometimes being rude
It's nothing against you
It just seems, too good to be true

I'd love for us to keep doing things together
But I don't want to rush the feeling (don't want to rush the feeling)
We can take our time (our time)
I really don't mind
Besides I gotta know, what you waitin' for
'Cause I don't need no
Casanova, telling me what I want to hear
Just so you can get over
And after you get what you want, you're done
But I been there and done that
But you don't really seem like that
You're just so cool, and it just seems

[Chorus]

Tell me if we stay together
In a month will you break it off?
I've seen it happen to so many others
And I'd rather not
Go through that heartache
