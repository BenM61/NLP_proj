Stairs, to nowhere climb
I take them, all the time
Crawling on my knees
Walking that old fine line

And when I'm alone and scared
I think up little rhymes
They would make no sense to you
But I make them all the time

And time is all mine
And time is all mine

It's the little pills you find
Crushed to dust, rolling out of sight
They and up in the strangest places
But I take them all the time

And time is all mine
And time is all mine

When everyone, is false
I tell them I'm just fine
I can't, remember their names
But I fake them all the time

And time is all mine
And time is all mine

And when I'm alone and scared
I think up little rhymes
They would make no sense to you
But I make them all the time
