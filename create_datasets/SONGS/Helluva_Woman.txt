Early in the morning 
I feel my body rise
But I don't come to my senses 
Until she's kissed my eyes

I got one helluva woman
I got one helluva woman to love me

She lets me go up country
She takes me down to town
She buys me gin and whisky
And my head goes around and round

I got one helluva woman
I got one helluva woman to love me

She comes around at midnight
Tripping down the stairs
Strives to make me feel right
And release me of my cares

I got one helluva woman
I got one helluva woman to love me
