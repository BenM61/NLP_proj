I guess some things really do Happen for a reason 

Its crazy 

Blind, I guess i was 
Loosing my mind 
Thought it was love 
So long, to this world yeah 
Trippin', only because 

I used to trust you, yeah
I can't do that no more 
I used to love you, Yeah 
I used to love ya 

Can you tell me what happened 
Where did we go wrong 
What happened to actions 
They speak louder than words 
I need to see it 
Is you tryna change 
Steady telling lies 
And now you wanna blame it all on me
Like i've been doing so wrong 
And now you wanna try to fight it Like its not the end 

I used to trust you, (i used to trust ya) 
Yeah
I can't do that no more 
I used to love you, (i used to love you) yeah
