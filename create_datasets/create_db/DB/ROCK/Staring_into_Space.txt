Take this world 
And all it's become 
I want to get out of this place 
We're all living under the sun 
We're just staring into space 
Give yourself a chance to be free 
You gotta give yourself a break 
Any other love you receive 
Is equal to the love you take 

Close your eyes, do you remember your past 
In the park smell of freshly cut grass 
I hear a song and that just brings it all back 
And it seems like yesterday 

Take this world 
And all it's become 
I want to get out of this place 
We're all living under the sun 
We're just staring into space 
Give yourself a chance to be free 
You gotta give yourself a break 
Any other love you receive 
Is equal to the love you take 

Close your eyes, do you remember that kiss 
The two of us, we just couldn't resist 
We became what I thought was love 
But that was yesterday 

I don't know what you are 
I don't know what you are 
I don't know where you are 
I don't know where you are 

Take this world 
And all it's become 
I want to get out of this place 
We're all living under the sun 
We're just staring into space 
Give yourself a chance to be free 
You gotta give yourself a break 
Any other other love you receive 
Is equal to the love you take
