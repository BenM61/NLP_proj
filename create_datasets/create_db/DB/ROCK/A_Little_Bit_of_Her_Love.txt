One little kiss
And then I'll miss her
All day long
She's all I talk about
My baby's smile
I'd walk a mile
For every one
I know without a doubt
I can't live without

A little bit of her love
Gets me through the day
A little bit of her love
Goes a long long way
When the whole world's 
Falling down around me
She can lift me up
(With a bit of her love)
With a little bit of her love
A little bit of her love

I know that I
Would rather die
Than be apart
She means that much to me
One tiny hug
And then she's tuggin'
At my heart
That's all I really need
You better believe

A little bit of her love
Gets me through the day
A little bit of her love
Goes a long long way
When the whole world's 
Falling down around me
She can lift me up
(With a bit of her love)
With a little bit of her love
A little bit of her love
