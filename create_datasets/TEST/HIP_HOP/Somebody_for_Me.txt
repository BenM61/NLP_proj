Love somebody

Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be
Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be

I'll search low and I'll search high
Trying to find myself a cutie pie
My destination leads me to a dead end
Over and over and over again

They told me to wait, so I waited
Anticipated, debating and delayed it
But still came up with the same ol' thing
Nothing

It seems as if every time I find the right girl
She turns out to be the very wrong girl
Tell me y'all, when will this madness stop?

I want somebody to love me for me
Not because I'm MC Heavy D
I'm looking for a love that's as solid as a rock

Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be
Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be

Now maybe I'll take a trip around the world
And find myself a beautiful, gorgeous girl
They say when you look, one never find
They also say that love is blind

It ain't that blind that I can't see
Somebody out there who's perfect for me
Somebody who's gonna love me for me

(I know you want love)
Love, that's what I'm talkin' about
A relationship, a commitment
Something to live for

(Maybe if you take your time)
Time has been taken and time has been spent
Now it's time for the lover to score

Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be
Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be

Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be
Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be

Yo, Eddie F. break it down

Yeah, aight, here we go
So that's the storyline of my life
No cutie pie, no future wife
Just relationships that bounce back like rubber

I guess I'll call it a day and throw my towel in
'Cause it seems that I can't win
So I'll just carry on being an Overweight Lover

Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be
Love somebody who love me for me
Happy happy where I wanna be

Love somebody who love me for me
Love somebody who love me for me
Love somebody who love me for me
