Open up your heart
Jiggle it a little, it'll open
Tickle it a little, it'll fly
Right on up to the sky

Don't live your life
Sittin' somewhere in a corner
Don't be a little jack horner
With nothing in life but a pie

Don't be afraid
To dig a little giggling 'n laughter
After all what are we after
Don't let it all pass you by

Open up your heart
Jiggle it a little, it'll open
Tickle it a little' it'll fly
Right on up to the sky

Open up your heart
Jiggle it a little, it'll open
Tickle it a little' it'll fly
Right on up to the sky

Open up your heart
Jiggle it a little, it'll open
Tickle it a little' it'll fly
Right on up to the sky
