I've got a merry go round, little girl don't you want to ride?
I've got a merry go round, now little girl, now don't you want to ride?
Now don't be scared woman, oh Lord Big Bill is by your side

Ain't you tired of see-sawing? Baby jump on my merry go round
Ain't you tired of see-sawing? Baby jump on my merry go round
Now you ride with me one time
Ooh Lord and I declare you'll say you're heaven bound

(Play it, boy!)
Catch a good hold with your hand, baby, set your feet just right
Catch a good hold with your hand, darling, set your feet just right
I'm gonna give you a good ride baby, ooh Lord I'm gonna try to dog my mind

You want to ride easy, baby jump on my merry go round
You want to ride easy, now jump on my merry go round
Lord I declare it's made out of hickory wood woman
Ooh Lord you sure can't break her down
