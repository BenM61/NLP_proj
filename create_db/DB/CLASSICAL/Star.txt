It's in the way you see the world
That causes conflict in this girl
So here we go
We're at it again
You flew by the starter flag
As I got to the end
But if you don't mind
The critic in me
We could lay the stage for this comedy 

Baby you're a star
You know that's what you are
Baby you're a star
You know that's what you are
Baby you're a star 

It's in the way we make amends
That way I harden the way you bend
So here we are
Never two of a kind
I could say my mind's made up
You say you don't mind
But if you can be sure
You're in it with me
You could take the lead in this comedy 

I know that shooting light
Is just space junk from a satellite
There's beauty in debris
Depending on who is watching with me
