Satan's rejects
Nobody's slave nobody's fool 
Nobody's tool nobody's judge 
Kicked out of Hell 'cause they were too bad 
Kicked out of Hell 'cause they were too good 

Fall down a cliff 
Impale your heart 
Sell your soul 
Do anything that you want 

Satan's rejects, slave to none 

Endless pathways depths unknown 
Now we're dead and free to roam 
Kicked out of hell 'cause they were too bad 
Kicked out of hell 'cause they were too good 

Fall down a cliff 
Impale your heart 
Sell your soul 
DDo anything that you want

Black riders in the night 
Darkness hides them safe tonight 
From this pathway they shall roam 
Now they're dead and all alone 

Fall down a cliff 
Impale your heart 
Sell your soul 
Do anything that you want

Demon dungeon encrusted claw 
Search the silence search the moor 
Kicked out of hell 'cause they were too bad 
Kicked out of hell 'cause they were too good

Fall down a cliff 
Impale your heart 
Sell your soul 
Do anything that you want
