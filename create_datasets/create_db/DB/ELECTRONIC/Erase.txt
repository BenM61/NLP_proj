Another week ends since you've been gone
It doesn't feel like its been that long
But I guess it gets better everyday
Yeah, Yeah!
My head is heavy, my mind is numb
I found myself in a stranger's arms
Cause I just want to make it fade away
Yeah, Yeah!
My heart is a broken machine
Need you to come set me free
Keep on playing the music, baby!
Keep on playing the music, baby!
Erase erase erase erase
Take it all away
Erase erase erase erase
I see you calling, I don't respond
And now I feel like I am right where I belong
And I am ready for a change
Yeah, Yeah!
What doesn't kill me, will make me strong
Just turn it up and then nothing's wrong
Cause I can just keep dancing through the pain
Yeah, Yeah!
My heart has been called out at last
I'm free come back to life
Keep on playing the music, baby!
Let's all get me to the truthest, baby!
Yeah, Yeah!
Erase
aha, ehe
aha, ehe
I wanna dance till I can't feel nothing at all!
I wanna dance till I can't feel nothing!
Erase erase erase erase
I wanna dance till I can't feel nothing at all!
I wanna dance till I can't feel nothing!
