Carolina moon keep shining
Just keeps  shining on the one who waits for me
Carolina moon I'm pining
Pining for the place I long to be

How I'm hoping tonight, you'll go
Go to the right window
Scatter your light
Say I'm all right, please do
Tell her that I'm blue and lonely
Dreamy Carolina moon

How I'm hoping tonight, you'll go
Go to the right window
Scatter your light, say I'm all right
Please do
Tell her that I'm blue and lonely
Dreamy Carolina moon
