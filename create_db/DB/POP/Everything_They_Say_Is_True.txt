Have you heard all the talk in the neighborhood?
All your so-called friends are saying I mean you no good
Ive got scars down my back where their knives have been through
Lies ain't nothing new
But when they talk about the things that I'd do for you
And baby everything they say is true

Everything they say is true 'cause there's nothing I wouldn't do for you
When they say that real friends in this life are few
Then baby everything they say is true

I don't mind when they say that I'm going nowhere
And when they're talking trash about me, man I just don't care
They can say what they want, but forgive them, Lord
They know not what they do
But when they talk about the things that I'd do for you
Then baby everything they say is true

Everything they say is true 'cause there's nothing I wouldn't do for you
When they say that real friends in this life are few
Then baby everything they say is true

Everything they say is true 'cause there's nothing I wouldn't do for you
When they say that real friends in this life are few
Then baby everything they say is true
Everything they say is true 'cause there's nothing I wouldn't do for you
When they say that real friends in this life are few
Then baby everything they say is true

(Everything they say...everything they say...)
(Everything they say...everything they say...)
(Everything they say) Everything they say is true
(Everything they say) ?cos there?s nothing I wouldn't do for you
(Everything they say) When they say that real friends in this life R few
(Everything they say) Then baby everything they say is true
(Everything they say) Everything they say is true
(Everything they say) ?cos there?s nothing I wouldn't do for you
(Everything they say) When they say that real friends in this life R few
(Everything they say) Then baby everything they say is true
