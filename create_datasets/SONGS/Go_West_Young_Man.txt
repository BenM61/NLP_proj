Maybe I'll be brave but just not today
Call me scared, but that's who I really am
I could be just like you

Excuse me, gentlemen
What exactly does it mean to be a man?
Excuse me, kind gentlemen
Can you tell me what it means to be a man?

Call me sad but how would you ever know?
Maybe you'll be there, but just not today
Pretend I'm dead, so you can go on living
I could be just like you

Excuse me, kind gentlemen
Can you tell me what it means to be a man?
Man, man, man, man, man

'Cause this is what you made me be
A straight up gunslinger
I won't be back, baby
