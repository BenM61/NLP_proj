I won't stop, I won't look down
I tried all my tricks, I broke all-new ground
And in this final hour, look what I found
I got this whole damn thing the wrong way around

'Cause people gonna judge and people gonna talk
And they can say what they like
Won't keep me up at night, no
People gonna judge and people gonna talk
And they can say what they like
Won't keep me up at night

Maybe we're still lost
Maybe we'll never learn
But as the dust settles down and I'm glad you're here
I feel I'm finally headed home, headed home, headed home, headed home, headed home, headed home

Moments stuck all over you
That's what I need and that's what we'll do
I could walk a mile in your shoes
I know how it feels to dance like you

'Cause people gonna judge and people gonna talk
And they can say what they like
Won't keep me up at night, no
People gonna judge and people gonna talk
And they can say what they like
Won't keep me up at night

Maybe we're still lost
Maybe we'll never learn
But as the dust settles down and I'm glad you're here
I feel I'm finally headed home, headed home, headed home, headed home, headed home, headed home
