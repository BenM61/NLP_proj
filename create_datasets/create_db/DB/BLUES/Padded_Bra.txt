Money bought you a little paradise
All created by perfect little lies
But I'm tired of waiting in the wings
I want to sing: la la la...
I've played my part in your perfect play
Now the time has come, I've got no more to say
Gonna leave all my worries and lock them in
I'm gonna sing: la la la...
The world is mine
Look out, here I come
La la la...
I'm gonna put on my padded bra
And get back on the barstool of life
I've had it
It's the last straw so do me a favour

Get out of my sight
You think I'm something you can control with demands
I'm something you can never understand
So now it's my turn to pull the strings
And sing: la la la...
Now it's time
To take what's mine
La la la...
I'm gonna put on my padded bra
And get back on the barstool of life
I've had it
It's the last straw so do me a favour
Get out of my sight
