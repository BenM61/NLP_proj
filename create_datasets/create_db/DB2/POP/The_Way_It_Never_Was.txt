Oh no, here we go again
You wanna take me back to way back when
Well, I gotta tell you, I gotta say
I got over yesterday

A long, long time ago, I cut it loose
Maybe you should too, you know

You remember the way it never was
You've forgotten the things we didn't say
If you miss me, the reason is because
You remember the way
You remember the way it never was

Oh yeah, you were always right
We never argued, we didn't fight
It was hearts and flowers, true romance
Why not give it one more chance?

Well, I've already been
Why would I wanna go through that again?

You remember the way it never was
You've forgotten the things we didn't say
If you miss me, the reason is because
You remember the way
You remember the way it never was

It was a long, long time ago, I cut it loose
Maybe you should too, you know

You remember the way it never was
You've forgotten the things we didn't say
If you miss me, the reason is because
You remember the way

You remember the way it never was
You've forgotten the things we didn't say
If you miss me, the reason is because
You remember the way
You remember the way it never was
