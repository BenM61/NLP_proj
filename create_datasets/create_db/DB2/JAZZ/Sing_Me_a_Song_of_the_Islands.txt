Sing me a song of the islands
My serenade that the trade winds blow
Sing me a song of the islands
Where hearts are high and the moon is low.

Where rippling waters seem to say Aloha au-I-o-ei
Bring me the fragrance of ginger
Strum your guitars while I dream away
Then sing me a song of the islands Aloha au-I-o-ei.

Where rippling waters seem to say Aloha au-I-o-ei
Bring me the fragrance of ginger
Strum your guitars while I dream away
Then sing me a song of the islands Aloha au-I-o-ei
