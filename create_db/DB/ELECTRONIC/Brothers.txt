Minimal big mistakes, and the last one:
In the car or the store, you didn't ask for it
Take your time, take the place, and react
Does it in my mind set the pace?

And rewind to them
And rewind to them
And rewind to them
And rewind to them

Take a chance, make a choice, you couldn't not look
Indecision overload is only chance figures
Change my mind, make mistakes, and put it past them
Raise the bar, set the course

And rewind to them
And rewind to them
And rewind to them
And rewind to them

You're just the same as you ever were
You fighting, no wonder why it makes no sense
I'm just the same as I ever been,
But I'm the only one who doesn't notice it

See me through the front porch
Sure, I want more
Off the cuff, doesn't measure
Got a front door
Take the stairs, make mistakes
Just make up for them
On the spot, don't pretend

And rewind to them
And rewind to them
And rewind to them
And rewind to them

You're just the same as you ever were
You fighting, no wonder why it makes no sense
I'm just the same as I ever been,
But I'm the only one who doesn't notice it

Yeah, yeah ah hey
Yeah, yeah ah hey
Yeah, yeah ah hey
Yeah, yeah ah hey
Yeah, yeah ah hey
Yeah, yeah ah hey
Yeah, yeah ah hey
Yeah, yeah ah hey

You're just the same as you ever were
You're just the same as you ever were
You're just the same as you ever were
You're just the same as you ever were
