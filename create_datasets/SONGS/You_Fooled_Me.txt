I figured it was like the other
didn't expect to go any further
Just knew it wouldn't last
I guess I was living in my past

Then you fooled me
Put good things on my mind
Got me feeling free

Fooled me
You put good things on my mind
Gave your love to me

At first you seemed out of reach
I was getting nowhere fast
And it occurred to me
Hye lady, you might be out of my class

And then you fooled me
You put good things on my mind
You got me feeling free

Fooled me
You put good things on my mind
Gave your love to me

I'm so glad, I'm so glad we started, girl
And I hope we never have to part

And then you fooled me
You put good things on my mind
You got me feeling free

Fooled me
Put good things on my mind
Gave your love to me

You had me wondering
I wondered if you really cared
It was torture not knowing
I'm so glad the feeling?s there

You know you fooled me
You put good things on my mind
You got me feeling free

Fooled me
You put good things on my mind
Gave your love to me

You know you fooled me
You put good things on my mind
You got me feeling free

Fooled me
You put good things on my mind
Gave your love to me

You know you fooled me (Oh, I'm so glad we met)
You put good things on my mind
You got me feeling free

Fooled me (You got me, baby)
You put good things on my mind
Gave your love to me

Said you fooled me
Put good things on my mind
You got me feeling free

Fooled me
Put good things on my mind
Gave your love to me

I said you fooled me
Put good things on my mind
Got me feeling free

Fooled me
You put good things on my mind
Gave your love to me

I know you fooled me
