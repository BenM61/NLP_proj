Face is turning white
From the salt of all my tears.
Face is turning white
From the salt of all my tears.
Lost everything I had,
I got to face five lonely years.

Everybody got a trouble
I got to live with mine right now.
Everybody got a trouble
I got to live with mine right now.
I'm gonna take a little walk now, people,
And I'll try to get along somehow.

I'll be leaving right now, people;
I got to stop now and figure out my time.
I got to get a bus, people;
I got to stop now and figure out my time.
I believe with a feeling,
I got to move on down the line
