Time is gonna take my mind 
And carry it far away where I can fly 
The depth of life will dim my temptation to live for you 
If, if I were to be alone silence would rock my tears 
'Cause it's all about love and I know better 
How life is a waving feather 

So I put my arms around you, around you 
And I know that I'll be living soon 

My eyes are on you, they're on you 
And you see that I can't stop shaking 
No, I won't step back but I'll look down to hide from your eyes 
'Cause what I feel is so sweet and I'm scared that even my own breath 
Oh, could burst it if it were a bubble 
And I'd better dream if I have to struggle 

So I put my arms around you, around you 
And I hope that I will do no wrong 
My eyes are on you, they're on you 
And I hope that you won't hurt me 

I'm dancing in the room as if I was in the woods with you 
No need for anything but music 
Music's the reason why I know time still exists 
Time still exists 
Time still exists 
Time still exists

So I just put my arms around you, around you 
And I hope that I will do no wrong 
My eyes are on you they're on you 
And I hope that you won't hurt me 
My arms around you, they're around you 
And I hope that I will do no wrong 
My eyes are on you 
They're on you
They're on you
My eyes
