Don't believe all those lies 
Darling, just believe your eyes and look
Look
My heart is an open book
I love nobody but you 

Look, look
My heart is an open book
My love is honest and true

Some jealous so-and-so
Wants us to part
That's why he's telling you that I've got a cheating heart
