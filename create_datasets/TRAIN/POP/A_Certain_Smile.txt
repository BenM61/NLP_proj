A certain smile, a certain face 
Can lead an unsuspecting heart 
On a merry chase 
Afleeting glance can say 
So many lovely things 
Suddenly you know why my heart sings 

You love awhile and when love goes 
You try to hide the tears inside 
With a cheerful pose 

*But in the hush of night 
Exactly like a bitter sweet refrain 
Comes that certain smile 
To haunt your heart again
