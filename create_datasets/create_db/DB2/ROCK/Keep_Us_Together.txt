Folks from California
Can't live without their sun
They've actor politicians
To infiltrate their young
They live out in the province
To find their kingdom come
The suffering of the father
The sins of the son
Oh! oh!
Here I go

Feel a little guilt for
The damage that's been done
It should be where you're going
Not where you're coming from

Oh! The bitter the taste ye'
Oh! When they don't deliver
Oh! Will keep us together
Here I go 

Lonely river 
Carry further 
Take me somewhere 
I don't know 
Like a platform 
For my ideals 
Where my hurt will never show

Oh! The bitter the taste ye'
Oh! When they don't deliver
Oh! Will keep us together
Here I go
