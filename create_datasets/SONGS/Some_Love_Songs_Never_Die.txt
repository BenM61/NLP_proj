You laugh and play your part
You fool the world but not your heart
'Cause you can't teach a heart to tell a lie

You thought it all would pass in time
The melody and all the rhyme
But still the music starts when she walks by

Some love songs never die
They haunt your memory
The pain will fade and the tears will dry
But some songs will never die

You found someone to take her place
A different song, a different face
Time may take you many loves apart
Late at night when your alone
And all your thoughts have come and gone
You'll hear her music echo in your heart

Some love songs never die
They haunt your memory
The pain will fade and the tears will dry
But some songs will never die

Some love songs never die
They haunt your memory
And even though you can say goodbye
Some love songs never die.
