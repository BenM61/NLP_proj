This is the only lonely picture
Waiting on my floor
Littering my shore
This is the last true burning letter
Given to a girl
Written by a boy
Living in a world created to destroy

But if I built you a city, would you let me
Would you tear it down?

But there you go for the last time
I finally know now what I should have known then
That I could still be ruthless if you let me
But there you go and I'm not done
You're waving goodbye, well at least you're having fun
The rising tide will not let you forget me
Forget me

This is your ghost that kneels before me
Razers on her tongue, a body full of oxygen
It won't be the last time she'll ignore me
The thinning of my skin, without the strength to go
The winter's setting in, to cover you in snow

But if I built you a city, would you let me
Would you tear it down?

But there you go for the last time
I finally know now what I should have known then
That I could still be ruthless if you let me
But there you go and I'm not done
You're waving goodbye, well at least you're having fun
The rising tide will not let you forget me
Forget me 
Forget me
Forget me, yeah

Ill raise towers and climb them
Rivers and walk them
Oceans to drown in
You won't make a sound in

But there you go for the last time
I finally know now what I should have known then
That I could still be ruthless if you'll let me
But there you go and I'm not done
You're waving goodbye, but at least you're having fun
The rising tide will not let you forget me
Forget me
