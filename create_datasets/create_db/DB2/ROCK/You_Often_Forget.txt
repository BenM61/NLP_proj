The first is for friendship
The second is to politic
The third one, quite differnt
On the last hour, they've been stopped

So hard to disappear
Usual goodbyes
No sign of life for many days
Of a strong way reappear

I can not refrain
(To believe that the day will come)
We'll see them again

They didn't smile on your scream
Headlights color red
For one single day
Their goodbyes for longer

Situation is changed, though
Body and soul engaged forever
Oh based on minds will be it
Somewhere where you can hear hills?

I can not refrain
We'll see the day
(To believe that the day will come)

I can not refrain
(To believe that the day will come)
Will see them again

The first have friends 
The third world fighters 
Body and soul engaged forever
It seems you often forget
(You often forget)

No more contacts 
No more words
But their mind clear will stay
Even behind the walls
The human rage reflection
The human rage reflection

I can not refrain
(To believe that the day will come)
We'll see them again

The day will come

Their doors' always closed 
And even open 
Some people got one dozen ways 
To prevent my feelings from running away
Some people got one dozen ways 
To prevent my feelings from running away

I can not refrain
Will see them again
Running away

I can not refrain
We'll see them again
(To believe the day will come)
Running away

The first is for friendship
The second is to politic
The third one, quite differnt
On the last hour, they've been stopped

So hard to disappear
Usual goodbye
No sign of life for many days
Of a strong way reappear

I can not refrain
(To believe that the day will come)
We'll see them again

They didn't smile on your scream
?
For one single day
Their goodbyes for longer?

You often forget
