I'm on a high, I'm on a high
There's nothing more to it.
We are the sea and the sky
And the blue that runs through it, yeah.

And there are some who say there are so many things I need
So I run or I fight and I crawl or I scream and I bleed
I bleed, I bleed

Well, it's a lie it's a lie, don't you believe it.
If you're fine then you're fine, it's all how you see it.
Oh, there never will be no conspiracy of happiness.

I'm on a high I'm on a high
And there's nothing more to it
I have the sun, it's a star
Why should I refuse it

And there are so many reasons I could give you why I should be down
There's not enough money or time and my love you're not around
Around, around

But it's a lie it's a lie, don't you believe it.
If you're fine then you're fine, it's all how you see it.
Oh, there never will be no conspiracy of happiness.

You're alive you're alive, how else could you hear me?
You are fine, you are fine, there's nothing worth fearing
Cause there never will be no conspiracy of happiness

I'm on a high, on a high
We are the sea and the sky
I'm on a high, on a high
I'm on a high

It's a lie, It's a lie don't you believe it
Cause I've tried and I've tried, and I can't really see it
Yeah, I'm trapped inside my conspiracy of happiness
Said I was yours, you were mine but I didn't really mean it
And I lied and I lied
And I wish you hadn't seen it
Cause I'm trapped inside my conspiracy of happiness
I'm on a high, on a high, there's nothing more to it, yeah.
