Well they say that we are tragic
And they say we're born to lose
You're the misfit, I'm the sinner,
You're the heathen, I'm the fool
But today you'll be the master or the slave,
It's up to you
Or my beautiful disaster take me anywhere you choose

Don't fight it, ignite it
This much I'm sure

I think it's time to set this world on fire
I think it's time to push it to the edge
Burn it to the ground and trip the wire
You may never be this good again

It's like a new religion speaking tongues
come see the light
Do not trip on inhibitions that will only waste my time
Let me tempt you with the evils of the flesh and so much more
Like a Babylon redeemer, like a pusher, like a whore

Just try it, you'll like it
I'll give you more

I think it's time to set this world on fire
I think it's time to push it to the edge
Burn it to the ground and trip the wire
You may never be this good again

It's so dark, I can't see
All the truth inside us
All I want is to feel something that's real before the end

Close the door
Turn the key
Do you like
What you see

Kill the lights
Oh come to me
Set it off tonight
Baby just like fire on gasoline

I think it's time to set this world on fire
I think it's time to push it to the edge
I'm so fuckin' bored so trip the wire
You may never be this good again

Just trip the wire
This world's on fire
Just trip the wire
You may never be this good again
