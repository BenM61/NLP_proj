You stole my heart
Yeah you packed it up
And you took it away from me
You stole my heart
Yeah it followed you up on the train

When you left me
You stole my heart
And I want it back
So please come back to me
Life was going on just fine
Until you decided you didn't want to be mine
You gave back all the things I'd given you
But kept the things you'd stolen

My hopes my dreams
And the most important thing my heart
You stole my heart
Yeah you packed it up
And you took it away from me
You stole my heart
Yeah it followed you up on the train

When you left me
You stole my heart
And I want it back
So please come back to me
Some might say to me
If he doesn't want you
There are plenty more fish in the sea
But I can't give my heart again
Cause I can't give something I don't have
And my heart is captured within you

You stole my heart
Yeah you packed it up
And you took it away from me
You stole my heart
Yeah it followed you up on the train

When you left me
You stole my heart
And I want it back
So please come back to me
Why are you doing this
When you know I'll love you to death
I don't want anyone but you

To possess me
I'd chosen you to give my heart to
You stole my heart
Yeah you packed it up
And you took it away from me
You stole my heart
It followed you up on the train

When you left me
You stole my heart
And I want it back
So please come back to me
