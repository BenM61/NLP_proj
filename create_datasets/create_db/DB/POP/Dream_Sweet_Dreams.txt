Love is sleepwalkin'
Coppin' unworldly sights
Searchin' and stoppin'
Bangin' the world to rights
Can't let kilometres
Or colours defeat us try
For something so sweet
We'll never be beat
We'll conquer the seas
And sail the deep blue sky

I dream a dumb dream
The fires are blazin' bright
The faces of famine
Are fed in the flames
Sweet light
The guns are a burnin'
The bullets are silent shells
The hands are a turnin'
The times are a changin'
The lovers are learnin'
Ringing out the bells

Hold tight
All night
Always alright
We're on a wave
