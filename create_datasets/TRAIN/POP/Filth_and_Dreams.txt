You're my gilmmer of hope
In a time filled with doubt
Sprinkle soul soothing words
On my imperfect world
Like only an angel could
Can't come clean from the past
Or your dreams pay the cost
In the cold light of day
When your joy slips away
You're still a part of me
When will I give you up completely
Still wishing from the other side
How can you smile so sweetly
Why do I still believe in filth and dreams
Filth and dreams
In the depths of your mind
There's a truth you can't hide
Happiness can't be gained
Till you've felt hurt and shame
Until you've suffered enough
Life's a wound that won't heal
No-one knows what you feel
In the cold light of day
When the joy slips away
You're still a part of me
How can you smile so sweetly
Why do I still believe in filth and dreams
Filth and dreams
In the depths of your mind
There's a truth you can't hide
Happiness can't be gained
Till you've felt hurt and shame
Until you've suffered enough
Life's a wound that won't heal
No-one knows what you feel
In the cold light of day
When the joy slips away
You're still a part of me
I said it may sound mean
But where there's dirt there are dreams
And they'll disappear as soon as you wipe away your tears
And wash your sadness clean, hey yeah
This mess we're in is where they joy begins
And on the road that lies ahead lies your future happiness
And all the hope in your heart, yeah
Hey you
Talking sideways and looking me in the eye
How can you smile so sweetly
Why do I still believe in filth and dreams
Filth and dreams
Filth and dreams
Filth and dreams
Filth and dreams
Filth and dreams
Filth and dreams
