Hollywood
Hollywood swinging

Hollywood
Hollywood swinging 

I remember 
Not to long ago 
I went to a theater
And I saw the Kool and The Gang Show
I always wanted
To fit into a band 
To sing my songs
And become a bad piano playing man
So hear I am 
In this Hollywood city
The city of the stars, movies, women and cars
Well I guess I
I guess I
Star

Hollywood swinging 
Hollywood swinging 
Hollywood swinging 
Hollywood swinging
