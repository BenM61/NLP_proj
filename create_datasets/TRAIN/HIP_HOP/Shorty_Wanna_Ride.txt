My 24's Spinnin', The Sticker's Still On 'Em
The Same Ol' Hoes, But A N**** Still Want 'Em

To The Window, To The Muthaf***in Walls
What A N**** Don't Know won't Hurt Him'
If Ya' Got A Old Man, B**** I Ain't Worried
And I Got Plenty Room If Ya Think You want to Roll
See This Is What They Make Caddillac Trucks For
Let's Go To A Place You Ain't Never Been, Down In The Country

It's Aight, 'cause, You Can Be My Wife, But Only For Tonight
Get Ya A** On This Bike, I Can Show You I'm'a Ryder
The 600 Coupe, With The Old School Wires
Geovanni Rims, With Perely's On The Tires
They Said 22's Wouldn't Fit, But They Liers
We Can Take A Trip To The Hood And Back
Then Go And Get A Room, How Hood Is That?
What'cha Waitin' On Shorty? This The Chance Of Your Life
What I Mean What I See In Them Jeans, I Like
You Don't Know What Your Missin', Just Quit Talkin And Listen
See I'm Just Holdin Up Traffic, I'm Just Right Here Sittin'

And Ya' See Your Best Friend, In This Impala, Ridin' On Chrome
If Your Ballin In Your Money Long, You Can Relate
But All Them Broke A** N****s Gon' Hate
