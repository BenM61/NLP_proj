Seems as though I've lived my life on the bad side of the moon.
To stir your drinks, and sittin' still,
Without a rustic spoon
Now come on people, live with me,
Where the light has never shown.
And the hornets flock like humming birds,
Speaking in a foreign tongue

This is my life, this is my life, this is my life, my life.
This is my life, this is my life, this is my life, my life

Seems as though I've lived my life on the bad side of the moon.
To stir your drinks, and sittin' still,
Without a rustic spoon
Now come on people, live with me,
Where the light has never shown.
And the hornets flock like humming birds,
Speaking in a foreign tongue

Now come a lot further away,
For the people who make me say:
City, on the bad side of the moon.

This is my life, this is my life, this is my life, my life.
This is my life, this is my life, this is my life, my life

The edony for washing our chairs,
Justifies our ways.
We lived our lives in wedding halls that may cause us to stay.
They exile here from other worlds,
Their sentence comes too soon.
Why should I be, made to pay, on the bad side of the moon?

Now come a lot further away,
For the people who make me say:
City, on the bad side of the moon.

This is my life, this is my life, this is my life, my life.
This is my life, this is my life, this is my life, my life

This is my life, this is my life, this is my life, my life.
This is my life, this is my life, this is my life, my life
This is my life, this is my life, this is my life, my life.
This is my life, this is my life, this is my life, my life

This is my life, this is my life, this is my life, my life.
This is my life, this is my life, this is my life, my life

This is my life, this is my life, this is my life, my life.
This is my life, this is my life, this is my life, my life
This is my life, this is my life, this is my life, my life.
This is my life, this is my life, this is my life, my life
