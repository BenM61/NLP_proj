I walk along your street (along your street)
And I try to meet
The folks that live close by you (live close by you)
Maybe they know why you had to go away

Baby if I knew (baby if I knew)
I could face the truth
But they just say, "I'm sorry, (say I'm sorry)
Really shouldn't worry, there'll be an other day"

But a day without love
Is a view with emptiness
And your love brings me happiness
I can't stand a day without love

At night I lie awake (I lie awake)
Try in vain to take
My mind off this confusion, was our love just an illusion
I really never know

There's no way to find (no way to find)
What's been going through your mind
There is something warm about you (warm about you)
Seems so sad without you, did you have to go

But a day without love
Is a view with emptiness
And your love brings me happiness
I can't stand a day without love

But a day without love
Is a view with emptiness
And your love brings me happiness
I can't stand a day without love
