Larry, call a load of smoke in
I wanna lose a couple days
We've probably never struggled coping but
I never want to
Promise again that I would call her
Forget the time 'cause I'm seven hours behind
It's probably good I didn't call, though
But I always want to

And I'd beg you
But you know I'm never home
And I love you but I need another year alone
And I've tried to
Ignore it every time you phone
But I never come close

And I don't think through things
I never get time
'Cause I don't think things through
