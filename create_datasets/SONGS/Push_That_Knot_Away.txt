May you always, may you always walk in hope
And may your days just be a way to walk upon a great high road
When the dark comes, when the dark comes through your door
Will you deny him, don't recognize him
He's not welcome anymore
In your life, in your life, in your life

And in the forest, in the forest when you hear
Something that scares you,
Be aware that it's frightened of you too

You can push that knot away, you can push that knot away
Yes, you can push that knot away, you can push that knot away, yeah
You can push that knot away, you can push that knot away, yeah

And in the morning, in the morning when you wake
It is a doorway for you to walk through to become what you make
And just remember you have heaven in your heart
It is inside you, and it will guide you so long as you listen hard
In your life, in your life, in your life

Daisy, you know this, you know this already
Daisy, you know this, you know this already
Daisy, you know this, you know this already
Daisy, you know this, you know this already

Oh, ooh you can push that knot away
You can push that knot away
Oh, oh, oh, ooh, you can push that knot away
You can push that knot away, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Daisy, you know this. You know this already)
You can push that knot away, oh
(Daisy, you know this. You know this already)

You won't regret it, I'm betting you'll push that knot away
(Daisy, you know this. You know this already)
You won't regret it, I'm betting you'll push that knot away
(Daisy, you know this. You know this already)

Yes, you can push that knot away, you can push that knot away
