A lot of bridges
I shouldn't be so scared to move
A lot of lessons
I shouldn't be so scared to learn
If I could lose you would Stop me
Hold on to what remains

[Chorus]
And all I need to know is you treasured me
And help me be the most that I can be
And turn into the one last missing piece
When it all comes down
When it all comes down

A lot of people don't seem to understand
My point of view
It doesn't matter 'cause I love the way I am with you
Cause you can take what stopped me
Hold on to what remains

And all I need to know is you treasured me
And help me be the most that I can be
And turn into the one last missing piece
When it all comes down
When it all comes down

I love I love I love
I love the way you let me
I love ya love ya love ya
Like I do

And all I need to know is you treasured me
And help me be the most that I can be
And turn into the one last missing piece
When it all comes down
When it all comes down

When it all comes down
When it all comes down
When it all comes down
