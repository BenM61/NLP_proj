Our day will come and we'll have everything
We'll share the joy falling in love can bring
No one can tell me that I'm too young to know
I love you so and you love me
Our day will come if we just wait a while
No tears for us, think love and wear a smile
Our dreams have magic because we'll always stay
In love this way, our day will come
