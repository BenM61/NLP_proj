If all you keep hearing it so long you will see me as a super star
And you'll have time to waste with your minions and tink
I see your face in front of me,
Still grainy from that old black and white tv
My whole family silenced,
Watching you shape destiny with your 2 hands,
Faster than the eye can see.

Mesmerizing
You know what skinny little me started to struggle,
10 years old suddenly bold
Cause i resolved to live like my hero in the ring,
Be smart never give an inch,
No retreat when i'm wrapped up
Respect from teachers, red necks
And creatures who attack in a pack
Like incensed never seen the light not before or
Since a young prince
And i remain convinced of his invincibility
Athletic agility, virility,
Seen your free spirit for every through eternity stings
Like a bee Mr. Muhammad Ali

I want to know who you are!
I want to know who you are!
I want to know who you are!

Your achievements defy belief from the belly of the beast rising like yeast,
My release from low self esteem
Came when i saw you rapping on my tv screen.
Float like a butterfly,
That describes my walk to school after fight night
I felt so cool cause i was at place too,
Love myself born slippy
Outta love for you,
And i knew that someday people would love me too.
None of that heckling about my black skin got through,
I would walk bare foot through hell for you,
It was how i felt back then i would still do for you,
So accept these humble words of praise,
And my gratitude for those glorious days
And your victorious ways,
Instilled in the young minds,
Skill sublime yours to mine!

I want to know who you are!
I want to know who you are!
I want to know who you are!
