Overloaded my bag
Fagged my frog
On the way back home
Eye contacted a doll

Fell three times (in love)
Like a hinny in the Quicksand Valley
The Quicksand Valley
Obtruded myself

Upon the sleep of
A howlin' wolf's coach
Appropriated half of his dreams
His dreams

I want to have them
Dreams
I gotta sell them
Dreams

I want to hold them
Overloaded my bag
Fetched a sigh
As the rain stopped

Feeded the lake of tears
Upon the coach's howlin' wolf
(The cryish cup was drawn out)
But I've got my

Dreams
I want to have them
Dreams 
I want to have them

Dream
I gotta sell them
Dreams
I gotta sell them

Dreams
I want to hold them
Dreams
I want to hold them
