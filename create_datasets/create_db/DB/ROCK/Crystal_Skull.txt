A truth
Prevail and ride

Into the black hole
Searching for crystal
Making the veins bleed
The source of consciousness
Alive
Crystalline resonance
Into the black hole
Searching for crystal
Making the veins bleed

A deep breath before the plunge
One million voices
Dispelling
A thousand faces
Disarming
Running through the darkness
Holding hearts in my eyes
Falling short of gauntlet
Covered in bloodsucking flies
The touch is cold
I tore a path screaming through wind and blood
I will it all
Burning deep
In my skull
