Catfish pie in gris gris bag
I'm the lover of the bayou
Pack your doorstep with a half wet rag
I'm the lover of the bayou
I was raised and swam with the crocodile
Snake-eye taught me the Mojo style
Sucked and weaned on chicken bile
I'm the lover of the bayou

I learned the key to the master lock
Learned to float in the water clock
Learned to capture the lightning shock
I'm the lover of the bayou
And I got cat's an' teeth and hair for sale
I'm the lover of the bayou
And there are zombies on your tail
I'm the lover of the bayou

I cooked a bat in a gumbo pan
I drank the blood from a rusty can
Turned me into the Hunger Man
I'm the lover of the bayou, yeah.
