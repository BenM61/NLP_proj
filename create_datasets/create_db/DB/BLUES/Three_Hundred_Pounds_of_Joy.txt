Well, all you girls think the days are gone
You don't have to worry, you can have your fun
Take me, baby, for your little boy
You get three hundred pounds of heavenly joy
This is it
This is it
Look what you get

You been pinnin' and hidin' behind his back
And you got you a man that you don't like
Throw that cat, baby, outta your mind
Follow me, baby, have a real good time
This is it
This is it
Look what you get

Hoy, hoy, I'm the boy
I got three hundred pounds of heavenly joy
I'm so glad that you understand
I'm three hundred pounds of muscle and man
This is it
This is it
Look what you get
