I want to be cool, to keep your friends amused
I want to be beautiful, a celebrated muse
I want to be high, entertain you when you're blue
I want to be wise, just because of you

Maybe then you would see me
Maybe then you would care
But there's more to love than meets the eye

Would you cry for more
If your love was truly blind
Could you cry for more
If it's only me you find

It's kicking me down

I want to be strong, to match your every move
I want to be crazy, a myriad of moods
I want to be bright, to stand out in the crowd
I want to be brave, to make you proud

Maybe then you would need me
Maybe then you would dare
But there's more to love than meets the eye
