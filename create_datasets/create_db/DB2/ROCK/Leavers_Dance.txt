Berenice 
My hands my feet are worn 
As much as yours are 
And though my head my hands my heart are forming 
They still feel worlds apart 

Berenice 
Beneath it all you're golden 
And that's all I'm feeding on 
And though my head my hands are growing colder 
We move circles now 

Berenice there's no release at all 
That's not worth dying for 

Berenice 
My hands my feet are worn 
As much as yours are 

Berenice there's no release at all 
That's not worth dying for 
And it's not for our desires but our design that we all fall apart 

Berenice there's no release at all 
It's worthless crying for 
And though my 'cause we all fall down
