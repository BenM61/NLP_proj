Move move 
Move move 
Move move 
Music for money 

Move move, no bother delay 
Move move, no bother delay 
Move move, no bother delay 
Music for money 

Got to get, I got to get paid 
Got to get, I got to get paid 
Music for money 

Me as a very young man growin up life wasn't easy 
My mother an my father work to feed my big famliy 
I go to di school to learn lessons that was no good to pq 
Beca now dat me is a man mi know di really 
I search inside myself to find my ability 
An the ability mi find is to make people hearty 
Dis a di I to the to the cio you know who me be 
Mi sidong on top a di rydim an cash in mi money 

Don't bother delay don't bother try play 
Better go get your pay 
Better you go an dig deep down 
For something you can display 
Money, money, money make money, money, money 
Too many many people dem say 
You are the only one that can 
Cover your head on a rainy day 
Make money hey ho hey, hear what I say 
I hope you don't ignore this thing because 
You have to make your way 
Don't get me wrong an lose your soul 
For this no sum can bring it back whole 
Better get ya shit together like Mars bar 
Work, rest and play
