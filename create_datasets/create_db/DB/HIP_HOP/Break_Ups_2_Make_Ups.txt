You and I  'til the day we die.. (day we die..) 
Yo  yo 
Ex girlfriend  how you been? I see you still 
tryin to f*ck with other women men  remember when 
I first met you in my cousin's house  a week later 
we was fuckin on your momma couch  now it's been said 
that big girls they don't cry  but they damn sure lie 
Look you in the eye  sayin you they only 
You and I, til the day we die, said you'd never 
leave me lonely, fly tenderoni but you phony 
Shoulda listened when my momma told me, soon as I 
turn my back you try to f*ck my homies, that was then 
this is now I got a new friend, ever since 
I cut them loose ends you want to bone me 
Add strife to my life, pussy that'll make me think twice 
about leavin the wife even, picture that 
You ain't want me when you had me, now you on 
your third baby daddy, and you hate to see a nigga happy 
So you tryin mad ways to trap me, lookin at my girl nasty 
Tryin to throw the pussy at me 
"Now look at this bitch over here tryin to act like me" 
"Uh-huh, f*ck that bitch, she must like leftover"

Waitin for the day that you front, and catch a lump 
from my black butterfly, that don't pack a lullaby 
Sleep on her, she said you bitches tried to creep on her 
in the mall and didn't know she had the reach on her 
Pearl-handled twenty-two, my Boo

And used up, pull your shoes up, all you need's affection 
but you're headed in the wrong direction 
Tryin to make this nigga jealous, with other fellas 
All up in my face actin overzealous

Cause I ain't got none left for you, plus you miserable

And got you actin high saditty with your slut committee
