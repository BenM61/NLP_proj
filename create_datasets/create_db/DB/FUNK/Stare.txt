Oh, baby

First things first, we'd like you to stare
We used to go on stage in our underwear
We changed up, we got a brand-new beat
Now we got the summers poppin' in the street
They all stare, can I help you?
Everybody jam 'cause this party's goin' ham
Just stare, can I help you?
Ain't nobody stoppin' 'cause we got this party poppin' now

Second things first, we know you got thirst
But we like it when you're fiening for the funk until it hurts
Jump, air, can you blame me?
Every time you whip it to the beat, it make a brother just stare
Sister, freak me
Nobody got a chance
You need to back up, let me show you how to dance
Stare, can I get a kiss?

I pull out a tune
Curvy ma', tell me what you wanna do
Do you wanna?
Uh-uh-uh-uh-ahh-ahh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-ahh-ahh
Do you wanna?
Uh-uh-uh-uh-ahh-ahh
Sexy dance now
Uh-uh-uh-uh-ahh-ahh
Sexy dance now
Do you wanna?
Uh-uh-uh-uh-ahh-ahh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-ahh-ahh
Do you wanna?

You don't wanna sneak it
'Cause you know we couldn't take it
But we like it when you shake it
Baby, careful not to break it
Don't break it now

Do you wanna?
Uh-uh-uh-uh-ahh-ahh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-ahh-ahh

Last things last
I need your number fast
I'd rather let the music talk
While you and me walk into the past
Into the past
Into the

Stare
Stare
Stare
Stare
Stare
