This is a call to the colorblind
This is an IOU
I'm stranded behind a horizon line
Tied up in something true

Yes, I'm grounded
Got my wings clipped
I'm surrounded (by)
All this pavement
Guess I'll circle
While I'm waiting
For my fuse to dry

Someday I'll fly
Someday I'll soar
Someday I'll be
So damn much more
'Cause I'm bigger than my body
Gives me credit for

Why is it not my time?
What is there more to learn?
I've shed this skin I've been tripping in
Never a quite return

Yes, I'm grounded
Got my wings clipped
I'm surrounded by
All this pavement
Guess I'll circle
While I'm waiting
For my fuse to dry

Someday I'll fly
Someday I'll soar
Someday I'll be
So damn much more
'Cause I'm bigger than my body
Gives me credit for

'Cause I'm bigger than my body now

Maybe I'll tangle in the power lines
And it might be over in a second's time
But I'll gladly go down in a flame
If the flame's what it takes to remember my name
To remember my name, oh

Yes, I'm grounded
Got my wings clipped
I'm surrounded by
All this pavement
Guess I'll circle
While I'm waiting
For my fuse to dry

Someday I'll fly
Someday I'll soar
Someday I'll be
So damn much more
'Cause I'm bigger than my body
Gives me credit for

'Cause I'm bigger than my body
I'm bigger than my body
bigger than my body now
