She wakes up in the morning
With a pain in her jet black head
A decaf coffee in her hand
And a Marlboro red
She drives down to the office
In her Japanese car
With the radio blasting
She dreams of taking it too far
But today she'll pay the bills
She won't think about the thrills
That pass away

She's an all American girl
An all American girl
And she will live and die in this man's world
An all American girl

Her eyes are black as leather
And her hair is killer red
How could she keep the baby
When she can barely keep her head
She don't owe nobody nothing
And she ain't on the street
But these drinks are getting heavy
And these lips are getting weak
She don't understand
Why she can't climb out of the sand
And break away

She's an all American girl
An all American girl
And she will live and die in this man's world
An all American girl

Her lover never came home
And it's half past three
Today her best friend told her
He's HIV
Something's gotta give somewhere
Forcing circles into squares
She keeps pushing on

She's an all American girl
An all American girl
And she will live and die in this man's world
An all American girl
