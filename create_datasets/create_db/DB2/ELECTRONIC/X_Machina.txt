Come, lay me down
I'm your garden home
Paid, my hands out
I'm your modern womb

Such a rush
Such a rush
Such a rush
Such a rush

Fade to higher ground
Tender gardens close
Taste of marry bond
Be my modern womb

Such a rush
Such a rush
Such a rush
Such a rush

Rush, rush, rush, rush
Rush, rush, rush, rush
Rush, rush, rush, rush

Rush, rush
Such a rush, rush, rush
Such a rush, rush, rush
Such a rush, rush, rush
Such a rush, rush, rush

Such a rush
Such a rush
Such a rush
Such a rush
