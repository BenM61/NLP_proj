Running down an empty street
Perhaps it was a railway station
Smell of ??? cologne
The sound of a celebration

Oh-oh-oh dislocation
Oh-oh-oh dislocation

Just a swimmer growing dimmer in the glimmer of a summer
Waving gladly, swimming madly, never never going under

Oh-oh-oh dislocation
Oh-oh-oh dislocation

The sun was going down one quiet evening
Someone came into the room while I was half-asleep
We spoke for a while, I couldn't see his face
Later on when he was gone, I realized I didn't catch his name

Oh-oh-oh dislocation
Oh-oh-oh dislocation

Oh-oh-oh dislocation
Oh-oh-oh dislocation

Just a swimmer growing dimmer in the glimmer of a summer
Waving gladly, swimming madly, never never going under
