Just a gigolo
Everywhere I go
People know the part
I'm playing

Paid for every dance
Selling each romance
Every night some heart
Betraying

There will come a day
Youth will pass away
Then what will they say
About me

When the end comes I know
They'll say just a gigolo
As life goes on
Without me

'Cause I ain't got nobody
Nobody nobody cares for me
I'm so sad and lonely
Sad and lonely sad and lonely
Won't some sweet mama
Come and take a chance with me
Cause I ain't so bad

Get along with me babe,
Been singin' love songs
All of the time
Even only be, honey only, only be
Bop bozadee bozadee bop zitty bop

I ain't got nobody 'cept love songs in love
Hummala bebhuhla zeebuhla boobuhla
Hummala bebhuhla zeebuhla bop

I ain't got nobody, nobody,
Nobody cares for me
Nobody , nobody
I'm so sad and lonely,
Sad and lonely,
Sad and lonely,
Won't some sweet mama come
And take a chance with me
'Cause I ain't so bad

Get along with me babe,
Been singin' love songs
All of the time
Even only be, honey only, only be
