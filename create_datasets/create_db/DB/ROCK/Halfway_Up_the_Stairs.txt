I'm only halfway up the stairs
Not up or down
I'm only halfway up the stairs
Since you let me down
So won't you tell me
Tell me please
What you're gonna do
'Cause you know I wouldn't be halfway with you

I don't want to seem impatient
And please don't think me fast
But we've got something going
And I don't want to let it pass
So won't you tell me,
Tell me please
What you're gonna do
'Cause you know I wouldn't be halfway with you

I don't want to seem impatient
And please don't think me fast
But we've got something going
And I don't want to let it pass
So won't you tell me,
Tell me please
What you're gonna do
'Cause you know I wouldn't be halfway with you
