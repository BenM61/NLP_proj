Tonight we're sitting here again 
Drinking, thinking of the past 
And all the things we've done 
Hoping and remember 

Everything is beautiful out there 
Outside the atmosphere 
That's where we want to be 
OK, it's pretty nice down here 

The nature and the wild, wild life 
But it can't beat the sight 
From 20 miles above 
Everything is beautiful out there 

Outside the atmosphere 
That's where we want to be 
There is nothing like to be in zero G 
The feeling's so intense, what a harmony 

Doesn't matter that we've done it so many times 
It is such a thrill and we'll do it again 
Everything is beautiful out there 
Outside the atmosphere 

That's where we want to be
