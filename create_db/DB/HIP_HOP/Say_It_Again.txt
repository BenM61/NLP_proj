And now with The Minstrel Show update
With your correspondent, Jennifer Duvall
How's everybody doing? This is Sean Don, you know me, Jennifer Duvall
I'm over here chilling with Little Brother right now
And it's feel good, you seen us, I'm listening to The Minstrel Show
You ain't heard, it's the biggest colored show on earth

I'm overweight, rap is fat to death
Obese when these beats catch wind of my breath
And yes, you ain't heard, you still rocking with the best
I just saved y'all from taking a guess
Not jeans, my dear, you ain't worthy to breathe my air
Or stand tall in the pair I wear, am I making it clear
As the best to lay his head 'round here
And no I'm not the heir apparent to whoever

They never could out hit us
Tried to think fast but never could out wit us
The only thing that they could ever do is outfit us
When clothes fit strange, I'm playin' Rick James
"F*ck yo' couch nigga!", I'm comin' out with a bang
Straight Tay, Pooh and 9th with no middle man
Everybody at the label asking, "Will it bang?"
I say, "Chill, just take a percocet or Ritalin now, let my people sing"

10 G's a show, whylin' out with pretty Tony and O
We make 'em wanna say it again, yeah
We make 'em wanna say it again
Beats from Mr. Douthit, fresh jeans, fresh clothes and outfits
We make 'em wanna say it again, yeah
We make 'em wanna say it again

I got so many rhymes, many styles to go with
And my competition all the while be hoping
That I'll quit bringing the pain like Ibuprofen
I can't dog, can't you see that the crowd is open, I mean
Mouths is open, hands in the air, just so aroused and focused
This is a movement, nigga it's bigger than showbiz
This is how I live it, I love hip hop, I just hate the niggaz in it

It's like, I'm just another nigga rockin' the mic
That's way above average and take it however you like
However despite, I'm left to write till my forearms get all tight
And my fingers start cramping up, pose ampin' up I'm standing, what
Y'all niggaz ain't man enough, chill agitating like dandruff
I ain't talking all tough, what them people keep saying is

Big trucks and wheels
Dominican broads that's cookin' my meals, one time
We make 'em wanna say it again, yeah
We make 'em wanna say it again
Niggaz copy my style, Big Dho walking down the aisle
We make 'em wanna say it again

Ayo, they beggin' for a taste of it
Get a plate, grab a cup or something, my nigga stop frontin'
On a mission, dudes still hunting
So stay out my way, act like you want something
Yo, my girl's a grown woman who ain't trynna get her eagle on
She'd rather be in bed gettin' her Keagel on
In and out, working the walls when the heat is on
Like Mary J. or Tweet is on, now sing along

Fresh clothes and cribs, gimme a salad pass 9th the ribs
We make 'em wanna say it again, ooh
We make 'em wanna say it again
Getting what's finally mine, sign of relief 'cause we finally signed
We make 'em wanna say it again, yeah
We make 'em wanna say it again

Say it one more time for that girl named Pam Gram
Or that some black chic chick, she got me saying, "Damn, damn"
You make me wanna say it again, you make me wanna say it again
Yeah say it one more time for my nigga named pretty Tony
That always come through it, the hoes that wanna know me
You make me wanna say it again, you make me wanna say it again

Alright ladies and gentlemen, don't go anywhere
We're gonna be right back with more of The Minstrel Show
Right after this commercial break
