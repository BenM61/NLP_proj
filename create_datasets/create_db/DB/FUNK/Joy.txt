Every morning when I rise, baby
I look into your sexy eyes, baby
Your love refreshing is good to me, baby
There's no other place I'd rather be, baby

What a way to start each day
Everything I think of
Just comes my way
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Cause you're my joy
You're everything to me
And you've shown me
How groovy life can be
Lips to lips, heart to heart
In a way that will never part

Sweetness is the name for you, sugar
And loveliness becomes you too
Dedication is your thing, mama
You're forever true to your man, baby

You're the only one
Who thrills me through and through
And I'll never find another
If I search this whole world through
Oh, no, no, no

[Chorus]

Now you know why
I smile all the time, baby
You give me such peace of mind, honey
Heartaches and pain is
A thing of the past, baby
I found happiness at last, mama

Anything you want
I'll glady give to you
Cause you never did nothing once
That's why I love you too
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]

Keep on loving me
Keep on teasing me
