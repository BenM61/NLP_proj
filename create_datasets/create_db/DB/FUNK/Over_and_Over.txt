Over and over

Laid back,
Laid back,
Laid back we'll give you play back.
Laid back,
Laid back,
Laid back I'll give you play back.
Over and over and over and over and over,
Like a monkey with a miniature cymbal,
The joy or repetition really is in you.
Under and under and under and under and under,
The spell of repetition really is on you,
And when I feel this way I really am with you.
