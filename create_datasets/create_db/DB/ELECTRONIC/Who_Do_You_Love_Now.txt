Ahh
Where do we go now?
I don't know
Innocence over
Fading fast

And it's hard to know what you're thinking
When you hide inside you head
You're still promising perfection, perfection

With empty words
With empty words
With empty words
With empty words

And it's hard to break a habit
You're lost inside it
Who do you love now?

And it's hard to break a habit
You're lost inside it
Who do you love now?

Who do you love now?
Who do you love now?

A moment of coldness
Cuts through me (cuts through me)
I've tried to remember
Why I don't leave (I don't leave)

And you're the cause of my confusion
Closing down the way I feel
How come I don't see so clearly, so clearly

Fighting to breathe
Fighting to breathe
Fighting to breathe
Fighting to breathe

And it's hard to break a habit
You're lost inside it
Who do you love now?

And it's hard to break a habit
You're lost inside it
Who do you love now?

Who do you love now?
Who do you love now?

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

And it's hard to break a habit
You're lost inside it
Who do you love now?

And it's hard to break a habit
You're lost inside it
Who do you love now?

And it's hard to break a habit
You're lost inside it
Who do you love now?

And it's hard to break a habit
You're lost inside it
Who do you love now?

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love now?

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love now?
