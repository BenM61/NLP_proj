Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen and down the mountain side
The summer's gone and all the roses falling
'Tis you, 'tis you, must go and I must cry
But come me back, when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valleys hushed and white with snow
And I'll be there in sunshine or in shadow
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so
