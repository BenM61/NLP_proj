Got a long list of things to do
And it begins and ends with gettin' over you
I can't quit 'til I'm through
I get up with the sun and I go down with the moon

Pain and tears can't be all there is
Is it any wonder I'm feeling six feet under?
Baby, you're nothing but too much trouble
Gotta bury this love and bury the shovel

Gonna dig me a hole and make it deep
I'm gonna lay it down, what's left of us
And then put this thing to sleep
Let my soul rest in peace
I'm gotta nail down the lid on these stone cold memories

Pain and tears can't be all there is
Is it any wonder I'm feeling six feet under?
Baby, you're nothing but too much trouble
Gotta bury this love and bury the shovel

Pain and tears can't be all there is
Is it any wonder I'm feeling six feet under?
Baby, you're nothing but too much trouble
Gotta bury this love and bury the shovel
