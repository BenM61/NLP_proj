It's time to separate the rookies from vets
Pussies from threats, truth from lies
Supplies from dealers and death
I'm feelin' this, I'm young and ruthless
Status unmatched, undisputed, some assuming
My destiny to rep these streets

I'm built for this, the will is too strong
Feeling's numb from dealing too long
It's real count ya friends when you on
My pen is visual, I'm real, men are miserable
I feel the tension growing, you hold a grudge
A 45 with infra holding no love
Hungry like my ribs are showin', as if you didn't notice
I spit the potent, uncut, raw, my mind is pure ferocious
Like a shark, I tear you open, cut you blood in my ocean
My pen it ghost people, like dope needles

When I rhyme there's no equal
The flow will freeze you, like medusa stair, I'm so lethal
Obviously, I'm a vill, with odds against me
Like Rasheed Wallace, it's hard to stick me
I'm built for this, in the street, I'm powerful if shit gets dirty
30-30 clips will shower, you exist 'cause I allow you to live
I conquered you, I kinda knew you was weak, I can see how cowards do
I write epic facing a scholar, question my life expectance
My essence is gettin' money, my aura like Lexus

On the mic I'm relentlence, pursue the perfection
Ya new connect for pure, uncut raw, what
I caught a rush when ever my palms clutch a gun, pen or a ki
Or a dime satisfy my every need
I write rhymes with killer instinct, yet to find a nigga iller then me
Some smile at my face, yet they still against me

I doubt the fake, never sleep or deny death for waste
Or conversate in the presence of snakes
When and where and time I'm measuring weight
You destined to think or where does he get this paper
Son, we nearly extinct
I realized that when buried Spank, the real will perish ya life
Conceal evidence my rhyme skill is excellent

M for the man, E executioner
G get money, A all my niggas movin' up
I'm built for this, for real it's in me
Like RK, I make you feel the big heat
The illest is me, the drug dealer empties semi-auto
I conceal on these streets that to uphold the kiss of death
Tryin' to deal ki's and snort blow, you can't replace me

I live the rhyme I visualize, you ain't real I see it in ya eyes
I spit nines, weigh coke on scales that's digitalized
The realness I live and die, the streets I epitomize, the trife life
I rock jewels with ice, verbally I bruise mics
Mega live it I'm ghetto, my shit is chromed out
Give me a pen and watch a nigga zone out
I can't believe the shit I spit is from my own mouth
