Yes indeed, yes indeed
I've got that feeling in me, yes indeed
You will shout when it hits you, yes indeed
Yes, you'll shout when it hits you, yes indeed
When that spirit moves you, you will shout "hallelujah!"
When it hits you, you'll holler, yes indeed
It comes out if it's in you, yes indeed
It makes you shout Jack, it sends you, yes indeed
When that jive starts jumpin' you will shout "let me in there!"
When it hits you you'll holler, yes indeed
Yes you'll shout when it hits you, yes indeed
It comes out if it's in you yes indeed
Yes indeed, yes indeed
I've got that feeling in me, yes indeed
When that spirit moves you you will shout "hallelujah!"
When it hits you, when it hits you
When it hits you, yes indeed
