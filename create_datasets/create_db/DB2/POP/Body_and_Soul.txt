Sweet and easy like
A train coming
Back to God's country
Love will be enough
And on Sunday when we go walking
I will say I love you
Your love will be enough

I'm with you now and we're together
I'm with you through the stormy weather
Let your heart begin right here again
Open up your life to me, yeah

Body and soul
Body and soul
I'm hoping for a spring wedding
We will raise the children and

Hold them to the Sky
Yeh, please believe me
The past is nothing
And God willing we'll live here till we die
I love you best and we're forever
Hold me it's so warm in the river
Open up your life to me, yeah

Body and soul
Body and soul

I want to love but I never find the time
I want to love to be there in your life
I want to love, will you make me be all mine
Oh woman please, body and soul

Body and soul
I love you now and we're together
I love you we're so sweet with flowers
Let your love come on home
Open up your life to me

I can't breathe
Body and soul
Body and soul
On Sundays we will go walking
And God willing
We're breathing the same sky
Please believe me
The past is nothing

God is willing
I'll love you 'til I die
With my body and soul
Body and soul
My body and soul

Love's the only
Love's the only country
Love's the only
Love's the only country I know

Oh, body and soul, yeah
Sweet and easy
Start hoping for a spring wedding
It's a new beginning
Walk into the sky
Yeah
