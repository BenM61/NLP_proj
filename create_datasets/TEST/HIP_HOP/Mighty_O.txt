You ain't a hater can't tell
Either wish me well, go to hell or go to Yale
Study human behavior so that you know who the hell
You dealin' with ain't nutty but the study gon' unveil

My relative in jail, ha, stay engaged
To whatever make money now he married to that cage
Divorce is not an option and prenuptial is void
Eat up whatever after but I'm tangled in my cord

Bored, kind of like a knight with the sword
Without dragon to battle so I'm running from a shadow
An impossible feat and I repeat
An impossible feat and I repeat
An impossible feat and I repeat
An impossible feat and I repeat
An impossible feat and I repeat
An impossible feat and I repeat

The damsel's in distress but they a mess
They only like my armor, and that I'm a performer
They read one magazine and wanna think they gettin' warmer
They only getting colder hell, maybe I should throw

A double diamond party in the north pole
Invite all the writers and journalists
Even biters will turn up man, to see who can be me
Better than me it's a permanent, smile on my face
Because you said you don't like my style

But that's ok but just make sure you don't touch that dial
And we'll be cool, touch it and you's a fool
Look, I'll get you hooked, ya'll crooks might even move
To Atlanta, Georgia, get a wife and daughter

Start a new life, and all that wrong you do you make it right
But hell, all a dream, I wear the crown, I'm king
Respect this mandatory, end of the story
Go fly a kite, category ain't got none
You know I'm right

Congratulations I'm a player
I thought you were one too but now I hear you loud and clear
Subliminal, criminal minded niggas so be aware
Black dog broke out the bitch until yo' ass it's ?bout to tear

Intended for anyone filling out this application
An estimate is needed for your under-estimation
I'm firing on the spot go back and check your calculations
Like a sniper in the bushes with that rifle, I've been patiently

Waiting, now that's a virtue
'Cause pussy nigga, I'll hurt you
Like the president's approval rating by serving your ass with words fool
Slam yo' back to the curve bra, like sanitation worker
'Cause ya trash, I'm taking out the trash and all trash

Get mashed and compacted because it's no longer valid
Go head recycled, repackaged and put it back in my cabinet
Boy that's germs, I'm fresh up out the store e'ry time
That nigga that be-I-g, go hard e'ry rhyme

Crowns all around I'm right after Martin Luther
No Jr. senior ?cause Bamboo is Antwan Junior
Dungeon Family and biologicals intact
Talk bad about the fam test diabolical attack

No gats or no raps, you get slapped about that
As a matter of fact, not fiction
Rumpelstiltskin you wack
Decipher words is like the code of Da Vinci
Don't go against me, Cain
I want you to go out there and kill them marks boy, is you with me?

Mighty-ighty-ighty-ighty-ighty-ighty-O
The worse thing since crack cocaine distributed to the poor
By the government, oh I meant, don't nobody know
Conspiracy theory? You be the judge, nobody's slow
