The same old moon is high above 
The same old moon that brought us love
No man-made moon can take his place in outer space
When I'm with you at close of day the same old moon shows us the way

No mere machine can cast the spell we know so well
Rockets may fly and conquer the sky 
But science can't bring us bliss
Time will revolve but they'll never solve the mystery of a kiss

When our hearts meet and love's begun
Synthetic stars can't make us one
Who lights our love from up above
The same old moon

Rockets may fly and conquer the sky 
But science can't bring us bliss
Time will revolve but they'll never solve the mystery of a kiss

When our hearts meet and love's begun
Synthetic stars can't make us one
Who lights our love from up above the same old moon
The same old moon
