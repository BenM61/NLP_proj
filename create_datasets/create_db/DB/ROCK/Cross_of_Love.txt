Where does it say all the love that we made must disappear
And who made the rule that the one who is cruel won't cry the tears

Well we woke up unsatisfied, got out of bed and said goodbye
But don't leave me here dying on the cross of love

Don't leave me here dying on the cross of love
I got down on my knees and prayed to the lord above
Don't leave me now, baby realize you can't make our love a sacrifice
But don't leave me here dying on the cross of love

Who pays the cost if the love that is lost goes unredeemed
And why should I care if this cross that I bear is destiny
My heart was pure, my love was strong forgive me if I've done you wrong
But don't leave me here dying on the cross of love

Don't leave me here dying on the cross of love
I got down on my knees and prayed to the lord above
Don't leave me now, baby realize you can't make our love a sacrifice
Don't leave me here dying on the cross of love

Where does it say all the love that we made must disappear
And who made the rule that the one who is cruel won't cry the tears

Well now I know how cruel thou art
Have mercy baby on my heart
Don't leave me here dying on the cross of love

Don't leave me here dying on the cross of love
I got down on my knees and prayed to the lord above
Don't leave me now, baby realize you can't make our love a sacrifice
Don't leave me here dying on the cross of love

Don't you leave me here dying on the cross of love

Don't you leave me here dying on the cross of love
