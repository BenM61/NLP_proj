Both of us were silent
With so much left to say
I almost said I love you
And please don't go away

But every time there's trouble
I go that extra mile
Now if we're gonna make it baby
You've gotta change your style

Why don't you tell me
If you love me
Show me how you feel
Together we can work it out
If this love is real

You've got to meet me in the middle
Meet me halfway
The world today is compromise
C'mon, c'mon, what you say?

Just give a minute
If you got a change of heart
Don't use me, let me go
Don't take my love for granted
If you want me let it show

'Cause I would give up everything
To prove my love for you
But should I have to pay that price
If you love me too

Why don't you meet me in the middle
Meet me halfway
Show me some compassion
C'mon, c'mon, what do you say?

Oh, meet me in the middle
Meet me halfway
The word today is compromise
C'mon, 'c'mon, what do you say?

Meet me in the middle baby
See you when I get there
Meet me in the middle baby
Yeah, yeah

Meet me in the middle baby
See you when I get there
Meet me in the middle baby
Yeah, yeah

Take it and give it
That'll be willing
Open up your heart and your mind

Whenever there a problem
I know that we can solve them
If we go put our love on the line

Hey, why don't you meet me in the middle
Oh, halfway
In the middle
Baby, what do you say?

Why don't you meet me in the middle
Meet me halfway
The word today is compromise
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon what you say?

Meet me in the middle
Meet me halfway

Show me, show me some confession
In the middle baby
Oh, in the middle
