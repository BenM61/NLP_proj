No words, no thoughts, no reactions
No life, no joy, no satisfaction
Who stole the magic from your eyes?
Who was that thief?
Who filled your head with all those lies?
Who took away your innocence?

Never let 'em push us down
Never let 'em kick us around
Never let 'em take our pride
Or take away our innocence
Never let 'em break our hearts
Never let 'em tear us apart
Never let 'em take us down
Or take away our innocence

So cold, so numb, such distractions
So filled with empty words and actions
Who stole the magic from your smile?
Who was that thief?
Who made you feel so unworthwhile
And took away your innocence?

Never let 'em push us down
Never let 'em kick us around
Never let 'em take our pride
Or take away our innocence
Never let 'em break our hearts
Never let 'em tear us apart
Never let 'em take us down
Or take away our innocence

Now who's the one that told you
you're the only one sufferin'
All around the world, everybody feeling it
Feeling high, Feeling low
Not everybody knows just where to go
And who's the one that told you
that one life can't make a difference
Higher people know
One life can move a moun-a-tain
Look without, Look within
When the student's heart is open
Then the teacher will begin

Don't play it safe standing for nothing
Better to die fighting for something

Where's your heart at?
Where's your mind at?
Where's your soul at?
Come on, come on 
Come on, come on 
Come on, come on 
Come on, come on 

Never let 'em push us down
Never let 'em kick us around
Never let 'em take our pride
Or take away our innocence
Never let 'em break our hearts
Never let 'em tear us apart
Never let 'em take us down
Or take away our innocence
