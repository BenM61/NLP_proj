I must've died and gone to heaven
'Cause it was a quarter past eleven
On a Saturday in 1999
Right across from where I'm standing
On the dance floor she was landing
It was clear that she was from another time
Like some baby Barbarella
With the stars as her umbrella
She asked me if I'd like to magnetize
Do I have to go star-trekking
'Cause it's you I should be checking
So she laser beamed me with her cosmic eyes

She's just a cosmic girl
From another galaxy
My heart's at zero gravity
She's from a cosmic world
Putting me in ecstasy
Transmitting on my frequency
She's cosmic

I'm scanning all my radars
We'll she said she's from a quasar
Forty thousand million light years away
It's a distant solar system
I tried to phone but they don't list 'em
So I asked her for a number all the same
She said, step in my transporter
So I can teleport ya
All around my heavenly body
This could be a close encounter
I should take care not to flounder
Sends me into hyperspace, when I see her pretty face

She's just a cosmic girl
From another galaxy
My heart's at zero gravity
She's from a cosmic world
Putting me in ecstasy
Transmitting on my frequency
She's cosmic

Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face
Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face
Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face
Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face

She's just a cosmic girl
From another galaxy
Transmitting on my frequency yeah cosmic, oh
Can't you be my cosmic woman?
I need you, I want you to be my cosmic girl
For the rest of time
