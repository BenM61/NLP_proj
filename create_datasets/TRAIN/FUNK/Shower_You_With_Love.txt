You know you knocked me off my feet
Came and made this life worth livin'
You touched a special part of me
And gave me tender love I've been missin'

I don't know what I said or did to make you think you want me, no
The question goes around inside my head
I lay awake sometimes at night and think about it, oh
How you made me whole again, life had made me so afraid

I just wanna shower you with love
With love, love
For the rest of my life
I just wanna shower you with love, all my love

You came and loved away my hurt
Eased the weight upon my shoulders
Gave me more than I deserved
When I thought my life was over

I don't know what I said or did to make you think you loved me, oh
The question goes around inside my head
I lay awake sometimes at night and think about us, oh
I swore I'd never fall again, love can make you so afraid

I just wanna shower you with love
With love, love
For the rest of my life
I just wanna shower you with love

There's no looking back, looking over my shoulder
I'm leaving my past all behind, oh
I've learned to realize, now the hard part is over
Giving you the best I've got till the end of time
I'm keeping you safe and warm, oh, oh

I swore I'd never fall again
Love can make you so afraid

I just wanna shower you with love
With love, love
For the rest of my life
I just wanna shower you with love, love

Real love
For the rest of my life
I just wanna shower you with love
All my love, all my love, oh, ho
