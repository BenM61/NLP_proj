Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Stand up everybody
This is your life
Let me take you to another world, let me take you tonight
You don't need no money, you don't need no clothes
The second coming, anything goes
Sexuality is all you'll ever need
Sexuality, let your body be free

Ooh huh
C'mon baby
C'mon everybody, yeah, this is your life
I'm talking about a revolution we gotta organize
We don't need no segregation, we don't need no race
New age revelation, I think we got a case

I'm ok as long as you are here with me
Sexuality is all we ever need

Ooh, baby
Reproduction of a new breed, leaders, stand up, organize
Reproduction of a new breed, leaders, stand up, organize
Reproduction of a new breed, leaders, stand up, organize
Everybody
Reproduction of a new breed, leaders, stand up, organize
One time say
Reproduction of a new breed, leaders, stand up, organize
Ooh, reproduction of a new breed, leaders, stand up, organize

We live in a world overrun by tourists
Tourists, eighty-nine flowers on their back
Inventors of the accu-jack
They look at life through a pocket camera, what? 
No flash again?
They're all a bunch of double drags who teach their kids that love is bad
Half of the staff of their brain is on vacation
Mama, are you listening?
We need a new breed, leaders, stand up, organize
Don't let your children watch television until they know how to read
Or else all they'll know how to do is cuss, fight and breed
No child is bad from the beginning, they only imitate their atmosphere
If they're in the company of tourists, alcohol and U.S. history
What's to be expected is three minus three, oh, absolutely nothing

Stand up, organize
We need a new breed, leaders, stand up, organize
I want to be in the new breed, stand up, organize
Sexuality is all I'll ever need
Sexuality, I'm gonna let my body be free
Sexuality is all I'll ever need
Sexuality, I'm gonna let my body be free
Sexuality
