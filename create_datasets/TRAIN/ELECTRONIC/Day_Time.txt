Daytime will open your eyes
Daytime will keep you alive
Daytime will open your eyes
Daytime will keep you alive
Tomorrow

Think of tomorrow
Look to the future
I feel your presence
Things wil get better
Nothing else matters
As long as you're with me
Everywhere
Everywhere
Now you will see
Daylight come
Night will soon be over
Daylight shine
Through you like a lover
Dark is gone
To meet the morning
Daytime will open your eyes
Daytime will keep you alive
Tomorrow

Daylight come
Night will soon be over
Daylight shine
Through you like a lover
Dark is gone
To meet the morning
Daytime will open your eyes
Daytime will keep you alive
Tomorrow
Daytime will keep you alive
Tomorrow
Daytime will keep you alive
Tomorrow
Daytime will keep you alive
Tomorrow
Daytime will keep you alive
Tomorrow 

Daytime will open your eyes
Daytime will keep you alive
Daytime will open your eyes
Daytime will keep you alive
Tomorrow
