You say you're tired of this circus life.
Tired of the freaks and the colored lights.
Come on Come on the night is young.
It's too late to change your mind, you can't turn back now.

So high, so high just you and me and the big sky.
Close the door and shut off the lights
6 o'clock we'll be taking flight.
Hold on Hold on and then relax.

Tell everyone were gone and we won't come back.
So high just you and me and the big sky
That's all we are, that's all we are, It's all forever
So your tired of this crazy crazy life

And no one can save you
How long how long can this go on
You only get one chance and then your gone.
It's all right, it's all right
That's all we are, that's all we are, It's all forever.
