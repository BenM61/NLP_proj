I’ve been spinning out for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinnin' on my mind
Sipping on red wine
I’ve been sitting here for ages
Ripping out pages
How'd I get so faded
How'd I get so faded
Oh no no don’t leave me lonely now
If you loved me how'd you never learn
Ooh color crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Well tell when it kicks in

I've been looking for a lover
Thought I'd find her in a bottle
God make me another one
I’ll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord forgive me for the things I’ve done
I was never meant to hurt no one
And I saw scars upon her broken hearted dove
Oh no no don’t leave me lonely now
If you loved me how'd you never learn
Ooh, colored crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind
This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream

Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in

Well tell me when it kicks in
Well tell me when it kicks in

All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line

Tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken hearted
Tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken hearted
Tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken heart
Tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken heart
So tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken heart
Tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken hearted
