Coolin' on the corner with the cellular phone 
You can tell that the East Bay was his home
More mail than the rest of the pushers, 
'Cause he's got a tech nine in the bushes 

And that's how the shit was handled, 
First name Jack, last name Daniels
Had two boys named E and J, 
E had the nine and J the AK
Clocked on a street called Hennessey, 
Robs with a mother fucker named O.E.
E had a bitch and her name was Gin, 
Had a nigga named Juice doin' time in the pen
You couldn't tell that Gin was a bitch though, 
'Cause she was fuckin' some nigga named Cisco
E&J knew tonight they'd come 
With two fat niggas named Bacardi and rum
The cap jacks hoe and the sight was scary, 
The bitch was all bloody and her name was Mary
Officer Martini wiped up the body, 
And all fingers pointed at Rum and Bacardi 
E and J told Jack the hotel, 
So Jack tried to bail Juice out of the jail
But ol' E had the judge on the payroll clout, 
So Jack shot the judge up and rolled Juice out
Now everybody's talking 'bout Gin and Juice, 
Juice shot Gin 'cause the bitch was loose
Now E is shook thinkin' they ain't gonna get me, 
I'll round up the posse and call up Mickey 
Mickey was big, he only sold 8 balls, 
Had ninety nine niggas up against the wall 
E and J found out he made the call 
So E&J and Jack and Juice nined them all
They were sent to the morgue and Mickey paid the bill, 
Got the money from the bitch reckless Strawberry Hill
Jack and Juice said Mickey wouldn't survive, 
But Mickey was slick he had a Colt forty five 
And now he's wonderin' how he got the word, 
It was the neighborhood wino Thunderbird
You wonder how the murder rap got so much juice, 
It was a hundred and eighty-seven proof, 
Check it out

Mickey sent St. Ides after Thunderbird, 
Time for the Hurricane he said word
Thunderbird in an alley waitin', 
Wearin' a beanie, tryin' to get a sip from the cop Mr Martini
St. Ides screwed off Thunderbird?s top, 
Spilled his drank and gave a swig to the cop
But it's too late Martini knows it all, 
Mickey and his boy OD were slangin' 8 balls
Of cocaine to the strawberries on the hill, 
So when he asked for Juice he got a quick fill 
Mickey had his boy on Bourbon Blocks, 
The murderous cop killer Mr Peppermint Schnapps
Mickey had this thing about nosey cops 
And it made Mr Peppermint lose his top
Martini off duty waitin' for the Night Train, 
Didn't know his wife Champagne would never see him again
Peppermint Schnapps creepin' with the Colt 45, 
Gotta peel his cap before the train arrives
Gotta stay low in Broward here comes the train 
All the boys said the engineers Bartles and Jaymes
There was a toot from the train and then a gun blast, 
Martini fell on the ground there was a big splash
Mr Schnapps got up because the cops chased him, 
St. Ides and Mickey in a 'vette ready in front of the station
But you know Jack and Juice was undercover, 
And Jack was mad be 'cause Mickey shot his lover 
There was big shootout and Mickey got juiced, 
He couldn't hang with the 1-8-7 proof
Juice was splattered and St. Ides had took a fall, 
And then Endo smoked 'em all
