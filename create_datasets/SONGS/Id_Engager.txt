(Is my cord dragging in the water?)
(Looks good!)

He's just a slutty little flirt and sister he's only gonna hurt you (watch yourself)
Ladies I'm screaming out to you from the depths of this phallocentric tyranny
My self-conceptions awaiting your invasion clumsy penetration punishment
(Oh yeah) When the hope of another wet nightmare is all we have to live for

Can't help it if it's true, don't wanna be your man, just wanna play with you
I can't help it if it's true, don't wanna be your man, I just want to play with you

He practically built the eight-bit empire and now he occupies the blur as well
When asking why their kisses are sorrowful remember the howl of our first verse
(I'm a mental little star)

(And again)

Ninjas!
Prove it!
Right!
(Right)

I can't help it if it's true, don't wanna be your man, play, play

Can't help it if it's true, don't wanna be your man, just wanna play with you
I can't help it if it's true, don't wanna be your man, I just want to play with you
