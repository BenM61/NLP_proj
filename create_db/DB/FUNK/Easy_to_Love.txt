Oh my darling
Where are you tonight
Our situation wasn't really wrong
But it was not quite right
It hurts so much to say goodbye 
Still I'm so glad we met
Cause you're easy to love
Hard to forget

I really miss you 
But then I knew I would
We had some ruff edges that needed smoothing
But the good times were really good
We didn't make it this time 
And that's my one regret 
Cause you're easy to love
Hard to forget
I say easy to love 
Hard to forget

You won't release me 
Release me, release me
I can't get over you
I'll always love you
You will be in my heart
No matter what you do 
I keep saying it'll be better tomorrow
Tomorrow ain't come yet
You're easy to love
Hard to forget
I say easy to love
Hard to forget
