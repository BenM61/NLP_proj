I'm so glad to be here tonight
I'm glad to be in your wonderful city
And I got a little message for you that a frend of mine told me a a few months back
I'm talking about brother Solomon Burke, y'all know him don't you?
These are the words he told me, children

Everybody needs somebody
Everybody needs somebody to love
Someone to love
Sugar to kiss
Sweetheart to miss

And I need (you, you, you)
And I need (you, you, you)
In the morning, when the sun comes down, ain't nobody else around

Oh, sometimes I feel, I feel a little sad inside
My baby mistreats me, I never-never have a place to hide
And I need (you, you, you)
Someone to see me through
Someone to hold my hand
Try to make me understand, hey

Ow, told you, told you, told you about you understand
Don't you know I need you, I need you in the morning, ow
I need you, oh, hey
Told you, you know I need you
Aah, let me hear you say yes
Let me hear you say yes (I need you)
(I need you) yeah, yeah
(I need you) oh, you know I need you
(I need you) you know I need you
(I need you) sweet little thing
(I need you) hold my hand
(I need you) when the sun is going down
(I need you) baby, baby, oh yeah
(I need you) oh, ah
(I need you) oh, so much is happenin', I need you
(I need you) oh, so much is happenin', I need you
