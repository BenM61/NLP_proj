(When I'm feeling)

I wanna love you
Want to love you and treat you right
I wanna love you 
Every day and every night
We'll be together with a roof over our heads
We'll share the shelter of my single bed
Is this love, is this love, is this love 
Is this love that I'm feelin'?
Is this love, is this love, is this love 
Is this love that I'm feelin'?

I wanna know, wanna know, wanna know now
I wanna know, wanna know, wanna know

I, I'm willing and able
I am willing and able
So I lay my cards on your table
I wanna love you, I wanna love you, love and treat, love and treat you right
I wanna love you, every day and every night
We'll be together, with a roof over our heads
We'll share the shelter of my single bed
We'll share the same room, for Jah provide the bread

Is this love, is this love, is this love 
Is this love that I'm feelin'?
Is this love, is this love, is this love 
Is this love that I'm feelin'?
Is this love, love, love that I (that I'm feeling)
So tell me if it's love, love, love, that I'm feeling
We'll be, we'll be together, with a roof over our heads
We'll share the shelter of my single bed
