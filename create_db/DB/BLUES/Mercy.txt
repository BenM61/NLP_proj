Mercy 
I'm waiting for the sun to shine 
Mercy 
I'm waiting for the sun to shine 
Standing here against the night 
But there's beauty upon our sight 
If it don't kill you it'll hurt you some 
If it don't kill you it'll hurt you some 
Mercy build and mercy break 
Yours to give and yours to take 
And when the world tries to call you away 
You say 
Mercy 
I'm waiting for the sun to shine 
Mercy 
I'm waiting for the sun to shine 
And all this cathedral that you have in your eyes 
Is violent revealing from the ground to the sky 
Is it warm or is it cold 
Is it young or is it old 
And if you can't touch the naked body of her soul 
She will fall asleep on you 
The world will tell you what to do 
Till the hands and guns and hearts and songs 
They say mercy 
Mercy 
I'm waiting for the sun to shine 
Mercy 
I'm waiting for the sun to shine 
Mercy 
I'm waiting for the sun to shine 
Mercy 
I'm waiting for the sun to shine 
To shine.
