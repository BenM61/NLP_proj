Some people got no style
I guess you've fooled them for a while
But now you're running out of luck, my friend

You need to know what you're doing
And exactly who you're fooling
Or it hits you right back in the head

All that tough talk
You'll have to eat those words in the end
Watch your step, kid
You might just need those legs again

There you go again, a phony to the end
But you're not gonna get that far
Climbing those monkey bars

There you go again, a phony to the end
But you're not gonna get that far
Climbing those monkey bars

You know it wasn't exactly pretty
The way it all hit me
Like a lift hook right in the eye

You and your affair with the friends
It's all fake and pretend
You're just a four-faced chic in a hide

All that tough talk
You'll have to eat those words in the end
Watch your step, kid
You might just need those legs again

There you go again, a phony to the end
But you're not gonna get that far
Climbing those monkey bars

There you go again, a phony to the end
But you're not gonna get that far
Climbing those monkey bars

You gotta keep it well hidden
What you did and what you didn't
Or it comes back like a bad surprise

You need to know who you're kidding
And exactly where you fit in
Better keep track of all your lies

There you go again, a phony to the end
But you're not gonna get that far
Climbing those monkey bars

There you go again, a phony to the end
But you're not gonna get that far
Climbing those monkey bars

There you go again, a phony to the end
But you're not gonna get that far
Climbing those monkey bars
