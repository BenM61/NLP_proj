1, 2, 3, 4!

I'm a hand in Mona Lisa's dress
I'm a smile on every criminal you'll ever acquit
I'm the things you've done you'd never admit
'Cause one hand is on the bible and the other's in shit

Right now, your face is in the crowd,
I'm shouting out loud, the one you counted out of the game.
Oh wow, take a good look at me now,
Should have never had a doubt, is that you I hear screaming my name.

I'm a roller, I'm a rider,
Number one motherfuckin' survivor.
So move over, I'm the driver,
And I'm high and I'm gonna keep getting higher, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm the one you thought that you could erase,
But a predator that's faster than the food that he chased.
When you fall off the horse you brought to the race,
I'll be the one who's flying by you kickin' shit in your face.

Right now, your face is in the crowd,
I'm shouting out loud, the one you counted out of the game.
Oh wow, take a good look at me now,
Should have never had a doubt, is that you I hear screaming my name.

I'm a roller, I'm a rider,
Number one motherfuckin' survivor.
So move over, I'm the driver,
And I'm high and I'm gonna keep getting higher, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
C'mon, whoa yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm a roller, I'm a rider
I'm a roller babe, I'm a rider babe

So ease down, and wrap your legs around me babe (Wrap your legs around me)
Ease down and wrap your legs around me
Wrap you legs around me!

Move over baby, get on your knees.
I'm gonna drive this little red love machine.

I'm a roller, I'm a rider,
Number one motherfuckin' survivor.
So move over, I'm the driver,
And I'm high and I'm gonna keep getting higher, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
C'mon, whoa yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah! (C'mon)
Whoa!
