Boog it, nothin' to it Jack,
Boog it, in the mellow track,
Boog it, dig it comin' back,
Fim fam skim skam jim jam rock!

Boog it, everybody out,
Boog it, who ya hunchin' now?
Boog it, everybody bow,
Fim fam skim skam jim jam rock!

You do like shinin' a window,
But you ain't got no window!
So you just picture a window,
And boog it, boog it, slow and easy.

Boog it, now you dig it Jack,
Boog it, that's the mellow track,
Boog it, got it comin' back,
Fim fam skim skam jim jam rock!

Boog it, slow and eay, you-

Boog it, now you dig it Jack,
Boog it, that's the mellow track,
Boog it, got it comin' back,
Fim fam skim skam jim jam rock!
