Weightless falls
Honeysuckle
Strangers
Strange this
Light from pages
Paper thin thing
Protected by the naked eye

Pearly sunrise
Nearly worn
Kneeling like a supplicant

Darkened skin
Afraid to see
Radiate
Open lips
Keep smiling for me

Darkened skin
Afraid to see
Radiate
Open lips
Keep smiling for me

Weightless cool
Honeysuckle
Fair skin
Freckles
Uncut teeth
Tranquil eyes
Bite my lips!
Bite my lips
Under your feet
