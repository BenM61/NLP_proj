And it's ok, and it's ok
And it's ok, and it's ok

And it's ok,
You give me everything I need.
And it's ok,
You give me everything I need

Whispers
Elevators
Bad boy
Dry
New york girl
Bang
Waiting
Huge 
Amazing
Down low
Something
Paradise

And it's ok, and it's ok
You give me everything I need.
And it's ok, and it's ok
You give me everything I need.

I got to preach your own
Whispers
Bad boy
Elevator
I can date her
New york girl
Cork screw hair
Bang
Now
I wanna be, wanna be
Stars
Through these times

And it's ok, and it's ok
You give me everything I need.
And it's ok, and it's ok
You give me everything I need.
