(Jeni Fujita) 
Flash The Message... 

(Forte'   Verse 1) 
Yo...You make me want to vomit 
Yo  pay homage and dos e doe my sonnets 
I school y'all niggas slow on socios and economics 
You mostly know about the dough from airplay 
You only know about the heaters  from the shit that we spray 
Import from Vietnam cats  like my man Phillipe' 
(?) Bustin' crimes back(?) I label it  permanent sleep stay(?) 
y'all cronies souped up 
My men ain't near dumb, we grew up 
You want your hair done? Hey, F*CK around and get your crew cut 
I organize the mental 
And live my life as the next essential 
Speak on this wild shit, as If I could begin to 
Who fall quick? Too many niggas fightin' over small shit 
You'll find me flippin' stocks, on boats that never dock 
I travel blocks, pick the best man 
Bust shots at the yes man, 'cause it was destined 
for me to flip investments 
Bag a lie, in the basement of the Best Western 
And if you don't want the consequence, then don't ask the question! 

((Butter - Singing) Jeni Fujita in parentheses) - Chorus 
In Ninety Nine 
Some blow nines 
and some stayed indoors! (Flash The Message, something's out there!) 

Ninety Nine, is the time 
When the deaf, dumb and blind 
All catch war! (Flash The Message, something's out there!) 

(Forte' - Verse 2) 
It's like... 
Me and my crew 
And a little tour show 
Learned to flip the dough 
With the money we've got 
In Ninety Nine, more war, more crime 
Some'll stay behind doors, and some blow nines 
Your conception is annoying 
Leave the things we was born in 
The street nights, and hope we see the following morning 
Niggas sold soul, for gold ropes 
Do crimes, for new shines 
Poor beer out on the spot, where police drew lines 
Hey yo word, we thirty plus 
Wear guns that's dirty (?) bust (?) 
Ask your men pa, you should've been more (What?)...courteous 
Like my rain drop 
And all my li'l niggas rockin' tank tops 
And sell arms, like government bonds, in Bangkok 
Bank stops on lavish trips 
Soils I marry with, a dime piece! 
A (?)rester oil(?) who speaks in Arabic 
If the karat fit, wear it 
Every man I know hold 
more so, y'all niggas happy when you barely go gold! 


(Forte' - Verse 3) 
This time it's personal... 
You like the artistry 
Rappers just reuse their first cut 
They say the same shit forever, 
and the use the word, so 
They ain't competing, they knew they was beatin', from the jump 
You get FUCKED! Grammatically speaking... 
You funny man 
Catch me on tour, A town near you 
With 20 Grand (Pikasoe), man it's etiquette 
Snatch your mouth off, for rhetoric 
I hold the greets from the street 
Yet subtle for lockin' shit 
Majored in Poly Sci, with a double doctorate!
