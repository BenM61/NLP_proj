Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
So far from home

This was life and this was safer
All was strange and always stranger
I laid in hate but so much later
I'm never safe from all this danger
The demon's eyes and demon satyr
I was bait but what would bait her?
Don't know my needs, don't know my ways so
I hide my face, no way to face her
This was loss, this was name
This was my truth, this was no game
This was not hope, this was not sane
And from these broken places made
That was loss and this was later
I wanted less but nothing greater
I couldn't leave, I couldn't stay
Like a motherless child

Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
So far from home

This was loss and this was later
Always hate but never hate her
I laid in wait but so much later
And never safe from all this danger
The demon's eyes, the demon satyr
I was bait, but what would bait her
Don't know my needs, don't know my ways so
I hide my face, no way to face her
This was loss, this was name
This was my truth, this was no game
This was not hope, this was not sane
And from these broken places made
That was loss and this was later
I wanted less but nothing greater
I couldn't leave, I couldn't stay
Like a motherless child

Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
So far from home
So far from home
