I don't go to school every Monday
I've got my reason to sleep
Don't you tell me how I should be
I've made up my mind 'bout the music
I've made up my mind 'bout the style
I know that I'm stable and able to settle down
But I keep

F-f-f-falling
Down with the sun
I can't give it up
The night is calling me like a drum
I keep on f-f-falling
Down with the sun
I can't give it up
The night is calling me like a drum
I keep on f-f-falling

This life is so full of temptation
And I want to keep it that way
I know myself I can handle the game
I've made up my mind 'bout the future
I've made up my mind 'bout the past
I know that I'm stable and able to hold on

F-f-f-falling
Down with the sun
I can't give it up
The night is calling me like a drum
I keep on f-f-f-falling
Down with the sun
I can't give it up
The night is calling me like a drum
I keep on f-f-f-falling

(Falling)

I need a flame, I need a spark (falling)
Don't be afraid to open my heart (falling)
I need a game, I need a shock (falling)
Don't be afraid my heart is unlocked (falling)
I need a flame, I need a spark (falling)
Don't be afraid to open my heart (falling)
I need a game, I need a shock (falling)
Don't be afraid my heart is unlocked (falling)

I keep on f-f-f-falling
Down with the sun
I can't give it up
The night is calling me like a drum
I keep on f-f-f-falling

Falling
Falling
Falling
