There's a place you hold I left behind, I'm finished
Since you took your time, you should know why I'm quitting

The secrets I hide, I do nothing
You'll always deny we're going in circles
But I'll override
Could be winter but I burn inside
In the back of my mind, I hear nothing
Keep this feeling alive, I feel nothing now
Then I'm in my ride
Anything I left behind don't mean nothing now

Can't take it back even though you wish I could
If you think I'm going back, you misunderstood
You cry and talk about it, baby, but it ain't no use
See you wasn't lucky when I pushed
Hold on, wait, you're fucking with my groove
Gettin' on this plane, making moves
Cry and talk about it, baby, but it ain't no use
I ain't gonna sit here with your blues

If it ain't your life, I don't know how to live it
And it broke me down, I almost drowned
It's not the ending, it's not the ending

The secrets I hide, I do nothing
You'll always deny that we're going in circles
But I'll override
Could be winter but I burn inside
In the back of my mind, I hear nothing
Keep this feeling alive, I feel nothing now
It's a race against time when you're on the frontline

Can't take it back even though you wish I could
If you think I'm going back, you misunderstood
You cry and talk about it, baby, but it ain't no use
See you wasn't lucky when I pushed
Hold away, you fucking with my groove
Gettin' on this plane, making moves
Cry and talk about it, baby, but it ain't no use
I ain't gonna sit here with your rules

I'll tell you what, there's no luck, it's all me
I'm staying up, don't wait up 'cause they're betting on me
Coming up with the sun around me
Fire me up, now I'm up and I won't be taken
Down on my luck, tell you what, it's all me
I'm staying up, don't wait up 'cause they're betting on me
Coming up with the sun around me
Fire me up, now I'm up and there's no coming down

Can't take it back even though you wish I could
If you think I'm going back, you misunderstood
You cry and talk about it, baby, but it ain't no use
See you wasn't lucky when I pushed
Hold away, you fucking with my groove
Gettin' on this plane, making moves
Cry and talk about it, baby, but it ain't no use
I ain't gonna sit here with your blues

Why are you testing me?
No, no, no, I'm not the one
Why are you testing me?
No, no, no, I'm not the one
Why are you testing me?
No, no, I'm not the one
Why are you testing me?
No, no, no, no, I couldn't wait for you
I couldn't wait for you
Couldn't wait for you
