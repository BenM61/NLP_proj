One time, to know that it's real.
One time, to know how it feels.
That's all.

One call, your voice on the phone.
One place, a moment alone.
That's all.

What do you see?
What do you know?
One sign, what'll I do?
Just follow your lifeline through.

What if it hurts, what then?
What do we do, what do you say?
Don't throw your lifeline away

Don't throw your lifeline away

One time, just once in my life.
Yeah one time, to know it can't happen twice.
One shot on a clear blue sky.
One look, I see the reasons why you cared.

One chance to get back to the point where everything starts.
One chance to keep it together,
Things fall apart.

One sign to make us believe it's true.
What do you see, where do we go?
One sign, how do we grow?
By letting your lifeline show.

What if we do, what now?
What do you say, how do I know?
Don't let your lifeline go.

Don't let your lifeline go.
