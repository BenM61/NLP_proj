I stop and stare, walking down the road again
For the better, for some peace
Shout my name out loud, so everybody can hear that 
I live on this street
On my street
On my street

See the old guy with the broom in his hand
Cleaning up what's left
And the cavalry with my bad boys once again
Oh, I feel so complete
Here on my street
I call it my street

I will always be right here
I will always be right here
I will always be right here
Here on my street
I call it my street

Fell in love for the first time of my life
Here on this bench
Said to myself I will always find the time
And then she moved away
From my street
From my street

I will always be right here
I will always be right here
I will always be right here
Here on my street

Many years have gone, I glance back to see
Growing up here was good
Many people say that don't you ever forget it
Try to come back soon

I will always be right here
I will always be right here
I will always be right here
Here on my street
I call it my street

I stop and stare, walking down the road again 
For the better, for some peace
