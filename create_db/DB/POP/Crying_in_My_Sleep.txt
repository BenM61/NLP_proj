I took a walk around the yard
I dug the flowers till it got too hard
Smoked my first pack of cigarettes today
Then I went down, down to Lucy's old cafe
I put a half a case away
Took a sleeping pill and I tried to watch TV
But you know baby, the leading lady
Looked too much like you for the likes of me

And I woke up crying in my sleep
I was talking to your pillow
And I reached out to touch your hand
And knocked the phone off the night stand
An the operator said "Can I help you please?"
And I said "No thanks baby, tonight there ain't no help for me
You know I just had a bad dream"
That's all that's wrong with me
You see I just had a bad dream

Went out to loosen up the car
Somehow I wound up at the Rainbow Bar
I had a scotch and soda on the run
But I didn't get too far
I ran down some friends I used to know
I dragged them out to see the show
I ran myself a bath and I tried to read your book
But you know baby, this time it just didn't seem
Worth all the time it took

And I woke up crying in my sleep
I was talking to your pillow
And I reached out to touch your hand
And knocked the phone off the night stand
An the operator said "Can I help you please?"
And I said "No thanks baby, tonight there ain't no help for me
You know I just had a bad dream"
That's all that's wrong with me
You see I just had a bad dream
