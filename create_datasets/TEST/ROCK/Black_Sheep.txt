Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I got lots of jealous lovers that all wish they had me back
Got a pistol for a mouth, my own mama gave me that
Making my own road out of gravel and some wine
And if I have to fall then it won't be in your line

Everybody's doing it so why the hell should I
Everybody's doing it so why the hell should I

I'm a bad woman to keep
Make me mad, I'm not here to please
Paint me in a corner but my color comes back
Once you go black, you never go back
I'm a black sheep
I'm a black sheep

I wasn't born a beauty queen but I'm okay with that
Maybe radio won't mind if I sing a little flat
I wear my boots to bed, hang a cross up on the wall
To save me from a shallow break who wants to take us all

Everybody's doing it so why the hell should I
Everybody's doing it so why the hell should I

I'm a bad woman to keep
Make me mad, I'm not here to please
Paint me in a corner but my color comes back
Once you go black, you never go back
I'm a black sheep
I'm a black sheep
I'm a black sheep
I'm a black sheep

I got lots of jealous lovers that all wish they had me back
Got a pistol for a mouth, my own mama gave me that
Making my own road out of gravel and some wine
And if I have to fall then it won't be in your line

I'm a bad woman to keep
Make me mad, I'm not here to please
Paint me in a corner but my color comes back
Once you go black, you never go back

Once you go black, you never go back
Once you go black, you never go back
Once you go black, you never go back
Once you go black, you never go back
