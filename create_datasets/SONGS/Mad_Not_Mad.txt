The windows are open wide 
Georgie Fame for those outside
And answering the call
Blue flames leap up the wall
Who would of thought it strange
That all of us would change

Out there in the hall
Shadows leave the wall
Then we had the plan
Back when it began
And as we turn we know
One of us will go

Would you dance with the madman
Over the hills and far away
Arm in arm mad not mad

The star spangled sight
Silhouettes at night
Dancing over Big Ben
Seven ragged men
Up up and away
Forever and a day

Would you dance with the madman
Over the hills and far away
Arm in arm mad not mad

Dance with the madman
Beyond the reach of yesterday
What are we but our friends
Mad not mad

Mad not mad

Hello crazy gang
Goodbye with a bang
What are we but our friends
Sailing round the bend
Left with thick and thin
I know it will or win

Would you dance with the madman
Over the hills and far away
Arm in arm mad not mad

Dance with the madman
Beyond the reach of yesterday
What are we but our friends
Mad not mad

Dance with the madman
As only you can
Join his company
