Now come along with me
We'll do the plantation rock
It's easy as can be
You'll wanna dance round the clock
Well it became a sensation
Rockin' on the plantation
Dancin' in the fields down to each dock
Now do the plantation rock

So come on bend your knees
Twist with ease side to side
Like the swaying trees keep in rhythm
Now have some pep double step
Shake right there like a rockin' chair
And stay with them

Well now you're right at home
Doin' the plantation rock
Just do it as you were shown
You'll wanna dance round the clock

Well just like on the plantation
Folks all over the nation
Started rockin' on each street and block
Gonna do the plantation rock
Do the plantation rock
Do the plantation rock
Do the plantation rock
