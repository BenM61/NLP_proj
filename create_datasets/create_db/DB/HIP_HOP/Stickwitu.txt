Hm, c'mon

I don't want to go another day
So I'm telling you, exactly what is on my mind
Seems as like everybody is breaking up
And throwing their love away
But I know I got a good thing right here,
That's why I say (hey)

Nobody gonna love me better, I'm gon' stick wit you forever
Nobody gonna take me higher, I'm gon' stick wit you
You know how to appreciate me, I'm gon' stick wit you, my baby
Nobody ever made me feel this way, I'ma stick wit you

I don't want to go another day
So I'm telling you, exactly what is on my mind
See the way we ride, in our private lives
Ain't nobody gettin' in between
I want you to know that, your the only one for me

Nobody gonna love me better, I'm gon' stick wit you forever
Nobody gonna take me higher, I'm gon' stick wit you
You know how to appreciate me, I'm gon' stick wit you, my baby
Nobody ever made me feel this way, I'ma stick wit you

And now, ain't nothing else I can need..
And now, I'm singing 'cause your so, so into me!
I got you, we'll be making love endlessly
I'm with you, baby you're with me!

So don't ya worry about,
People hanging around,
They ain't bring us down!
I know you, and you know me,
And that's all that counts
So don't ya worry about,
People hanging around,
They ain't bring us down!
I know you, and you know me
And that's why, that's why I say

Nobody gonna love me better, I'm gon' stick wit you forever
Nobody gonna take me higher, I'm gon' stick wit you
You know how to appreciate me, I'm gon' stick wit you, my baby
Nobody ever made me feel this way, I'ma stick wit you

Nobody gonna love me better, I'm gon' stick wit you forever
Nobody gonna take me higher, I'm gon' stick wit you
You know how to appreciate me, I'm gon' stick wit you, my baby
Nobody ever made me feel this way, I'ma stick wit you
