One of these days
One of these very ordinary days
Your going to call my name
And I won't be there

After the days
After these very,very many days
Your going to see the light
And I won't be there

And on that day
Some how I'll find the strength to stay away
I won't give in
I will not let myself be taken in
Again oh no my friend

One of these days
Out of the blue you'll start remembering
And I won't care
'Cause I won't be there

Oh and on that day
I swear I'll find the strength somehow to stay away
I won't give in
I will not let myself be taken in
Again oh no my friend

That's what I say
That's what I tell myself I won't give in
So try it someday and you'll see that I won't be there
No you know,you know I won't be there
One of these,one of these,one of these days
I won't be there
