[Singing]
We are the G, O-D's
And we came to rock, the spot
Like Ironman Starks
They be the illest MC's, in the world today
Cappa Raekwon and the are-Z-A
So listen to them clear, and put the box right near your ear
Light your blunts and down your beers
'Cause you could never f*** with Wu-Tang Killer Beez...

Say peace to cats who rock mack knowledge
Knowledgists, street astrologists
Light up the mic God, knowledge this
Fly joints that carried your points

Corolla Motorola holder
Play it God, he pack over the shoulder
Chrome tanks, player like Yanks, check the franchise
Front on my guys, my enterprise splash many lives

Rapel on fakes like reflectors
He had sugar in his ear in his last crack career
We can can him, manhandle him, if you want to
Run in his crib-o, get ditto, skate like a limo

And jet to the flyest estate, relate take a break
Break down an eighth and then wait drop it like Drake
Thugs they be booing and screwing, we canoeing
Claim they doin' the same s*** we doin', f*** your unit

It's the same style, RZA trainable, jump the turnstyle
On the alley tried to challenge God for the new vials
Especially that, aluminum bat in the act
Relax, lay back, sell a grenade a day, it pays black

The Mac-10 flex white cats like Windex
Index finger be sore, bustin' these fly scripts
The Wally kid count crazily grands with our plans
Layin' with my b****es and my mans in Lex Lands

We losin' em, jet to the stash and now Jerusalem
Abusin' em, rockin his jewels like we usin em
Low pro star, seven thick waves rock Polar
Roll with the older God, build with the Son and the Star

[Chorus:]
All these MC's start realizing
That Ghost got that s***, that'll keep you vibing
The Wu is here to bring, you Shaolin's finest
But if your shields are weak, you better step behind us

Mercury raps is roughed then God just shown like taps
Red and white Wally's that match, bend my baseball hat
Doin forever s***, like pissin out the window on turnpikes
Robbin n****z for leathers, high swipin on dirt bikes

Voice be metal like Von Harper radio bubble
Murder sleep away camp, the fly lady champ
The arsonist, who burn with his pen regardless
Slaying all these earthlings and fake foreigners

In the Philippines, pick herbal beans, bubbling strings
Body chemical CREAM, we burn kerosene
The conviction of my tape is rape, wicked like Nixon
Long-heads inscriptions with three sixes in

Kiss the pyramid experiment with high explosive
I slapbox with Jesus, lick shots at Joseph
Zoomin like binoculars, the rap blacksmith
Money's Rolex, with sparkles, Chef ragtop is spotless

I'm Iron Man no cheap cash metal I'm steel alloy
True identity hidden inside secret tabloids
Breathe oxygen both sides of my jaw carry oxes
The track hit like the bangers, in hundred watt boxes

Yo jostling these cats while Little J be deli-ing
Sip Irish Moss out of Widelians

[Chorus]

Give me the the fifty thou, small bills
My gold plate, my slang kills
My Benz spills, whattup Lils
Murder one Dunn

Killer bee stung, guess who back home Son
My technique of slang camp won, third platoon soon
Cristal bottles, cages of boom, probably wardrobe
The mad-hatter big dick style, beware goons

Smuggle balloons, lord of dooms, in fat p**** wombs
Let the Gods build, pull up the grill
Check out the mad skills
Top secret technique, too hard for you to peep it

And keep it, jiggy style of rap and watchin knuckle slang 
Sweep it out of order ape recorder can't record my slaughter 
Spoil the rotten Don is too good to be forgotten
High top notch, borderline rhymes is handc***ed

Ninety-six, my ill sound clash is still hot
Get yourself shot

[Chorus]
