This is not like me, I don't get that deep
I'm usually puttin' all my walls up in-between
I cannot fight this 'cause you make me weak
My hear is pumpin' like it's following the beat

You have got me feelin' like I'm trippin'
Seen a lot of shit, but you're the real thing
Nothing like a lovin' that I've witnessed
When you're with me

So just feel my touch and let it
Make you feel alright
And I might just break my habits
And stay with you tonight
I'll break my habits
I'll break my habits
And stay with you tonight

I'll break my habits

Always start off and fight on my own
Now I'm relying on your love to get it on

You have got me feelin' like I'm trippin'
Seen a lot of shit, but you're the real thing
Nothing like a lovin' that I've witnessed
When you're with me

So just feel my touch and let it
Make you feel alright
And I might just break my habits
And stay with you tonight

I'll break my habits
I'll break my habits
I'll break my habits

All that I need is a quick fix from you, baby
You'll wanna leave 'cause I give something new so I'll

I'll break my habits
I'll break my habits
