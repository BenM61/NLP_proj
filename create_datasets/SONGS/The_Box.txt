Shares his neighbors with a building
Knows addresses of by heart
Draws a picture of his future
Keeps the paper close at hand

Packs his tongue into a suitcase
Suffers terror on the train
And he wants to start a movement
'Cause he's indestructible

Destructible...suffers terror on the train
He indestructible
And you know they'll never find us
And they'll leave us alone
And if we just keep on talking

Then we'll still make it home
There's commotion and promotion
Now they've done good every war
Sell our pictures to a paper
Now that everyone must know

Trading satellites for substance
Let spectators pay their way
We'll invade the trevi fountain
Now that everyone must pay

Mama and babies mother tragedy
Babies mothers tragedy
Babies mothers tragedy
Terrifies the kill
