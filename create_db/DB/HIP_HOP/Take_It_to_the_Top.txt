[Chorus]
Shawty if you love me like your lost and you can't find your way without me
You goin' wake up one day when I'm gone thinking why did you doubt me
But you better believe me I take it to the, take it to the, take it to the top
You got to believe me I take it to the, take it to the, take it to the top

I made you why would I play you?
Not only showered you with gifts I bathed you
Plus I hit the first night and I stayed too
I know it's early but I just thought I would page you

Hey you!
More then I'm willing and able
You get tired from all the presents that I gave you
Still you

Be acting like you someone faithful
You swear I'm fucking on a rendezvous
When you think of freaking I be on my girl
Even when we not freaking you be on my mind
I'm more mature I'm flipping them dollars

So I can't give you all of my time cause I'm,
24 hours a day stuck in a war
Atleast 8 hours or more cooking them rhymes up
So 16 hours just you can hit the store and you complaining you want more free time?

[Chorus]

You got to believe me baby I'm making it easy baby
My SWA you watching Feezy baby
I got a mean Mercedes and got a cleaning lady
Heres some advice for you, you better heat it baby

Long as your whip in the room and got a strip on them booms
So what the f*ck do you care cause I live on the road
I'm busy gripping them Ole's that's how you gripping them clothes
Home I ain't getting no dough I can't be sitting in there

So what they worth is they own baby I'm different then them
I bring them benjamins in look at the kitchen in there
Look at the living room set look at that thing on your neck
Matching that thing on your wrist but got some digits in there

I give a f*ck if they stare I give a f*ck what they think
I get them budgets in check and put the diesel in there
Don't let them people in there
Gas you up and get you all upset
You win my heart and I'm a keep you there

[Chorus]

And since these feelings at heart are not right I,
Put in position to rock ice right and,
Them other niggas be singing the same song they might,
Have what it takes but they handle things wrong

You in your mens or something you want the meaner man
You got to believe yourself cause I believe in me
I got the Beamer keys I'm just as clean as these
I smoke the greenest trees
Them other niggas be fronting

[Chorus]
