If being me is easy from where you stand
Seeing is believing from where I am
Try being me if you think you can
You think I got it easy
Try being me

And if then you do
I did before
I did it all before you
And so much more
Everything you see, you see, I already saw
You want something new to see
Try being me

Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes

If being me is easy from where you stand
Seeing is believing from where I am
Try being me if you think you can
You think I got it easy
Try being me

Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
