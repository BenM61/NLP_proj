I believe what you say
When you say you're going steady with nobody else but me
I believe what you say when you say you don't kiss
Nobody else but me

I believe, do believe
I believe, yea believe pretty baby
Believe you're going steady with nobody else but me
Well there's one thing baby that i want you to know
When you rock with me don't rock too slow
Move on in and get toe to toe
We gonna rock 'till we can't rock no more

I believe, do believe
I believe, yea believe pretty baby
Believe you're going steady with nobody else but me

(solo)
I believe what you say when you say you don't miss
Nobody else but me
I believe what you say when you say you don't kiss
Nobody else but me

I believe, do believe
I believe, yea believe pretty baby
Believe you're going steady with nobody else but me

When you kiss me baby and you roll your eyes
I get a funny feeling like i'm hypnotized
Chills run all up and down my spine
Lets me know that you're mine all mine
