There must've been a moment
A second or a time
When I didn't look up or I missed some kind of sign
Turned the wrong direction
When she was just an inch away
Like a missed connection
And my future slipped away
There've been times when I feel like I'm
Conspired against by faith
It's almost bad enough to make me hate

I'm sick of building castles in the sand
Just waiting for another face to break my promised land
I've been looking for the real thing in a lonely one night stand
Like building castles in the sand

'Cos it terrifies me, ending up alone
And it walks beside me, the ghost of chances gone
Did I have it did I let it go, or close the door to fast ?
Is there an answer locked up in my past ? in my past

I'm sick of building castles in the sand
Seem like everybody else I know can hold it in their hands
So will it ever happen or am I doomed to walk this land
Just building castle's in the sand ?

I've been crying, I've been living alone so long
I've been over and over the reasons
But I can't find the thing that's wrong
In my mind, all the evidence seems to say
I wouldn't even know it if she walked right in today

I'm sick of building castles in the sand
Seems like everybody else I know can hold it it their hands
So will it ever happen or am I doomed to walk this land
Just building castles in the sand ?
