I'd like to make your golden dreams come true, Dear
If I only had my way
A paradise this world would seem to you, Dear
If I only had my way

You'd never know a care, a pain, or sorrow
If I only had my way
I'd fill your cup of happiness tomorrow
If I only had my way

If I had my way, Dear, forever there'd be
A garden of roses for you and for me
A thousand and one things, Dear, I would do
Just for you, just for you

If I had my way we would never grow old
And sunshine I'd bring every day
You would reign all alone, like a queen on a throne
If I had my way
