There's a story the gypsies know is true
That when your love wears golden earrings
He belongs to you
An old love story that's known to very few
But if you wear those golden earrings
Love will come to you

By the burning fire, they will glow with every coal
You will hear desire whisper low inside your soul
So be my gypsy
Make love your guiding light
And let this pair of golden earrings
Cast their spell tonight

So be my gypsy
Make love your guiding light
And let this pair of golden earrings
Cast their spell tonight
