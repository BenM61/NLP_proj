Said on my real
I like them lovely ladies just like this
Said on my real
I like them lovely ladies just like this

Baby, all week I've been sayin'
You need to open up
'Cause, girl, I think I've been patient
For long enough
I ain't never been the type for holdin' in
Or holdin' out for sex
But lady, I guess I see you as different
But girl, I can't hold it no more

Take my love; it's yours
Baby, I can read your mind
You want my love
You want it all through the night and
Baby, I, I'll get it to crackin'
Your body wants more
And I've put in so much time
Just give me your love, every bit of it
Baby, I, I can make it happen

Baby, tell me, tell me what makes you happy
Watch me while I make it happen
Whatever it is I'm for giving you
All of my love
Baby, hold up because I've got some more
And your body deserves it all
I've got everything under control
Take my love

Take my love; it's yours
Baby, I can read your mind
You want my love
You want it all through the night and
Baby, I, I'll get it to crackin'
Your body wants more
And I've put in so much time
Just give me your love, every bit of it
Baby, I, I can make it happen

I can tell when we kiss
Oh, you like it
And the more I do this
You get excited
And I promise it gets better
There's somethin' I want to tell you
Relax
While I go deeper, baby, deeper, baby, deeper, baby
In a second I'm about to reach your favorite spot
Give you all I got
There it is
Baby, won't you take my love?

Take my love; it's yours
Baby, I can read your mind
You want my love
You want it all through the night and
Baby, I, I'll get it to crackin'
Your body wants more
And I've put in so much time
Just give me your love, every bit of it
Baby, I, I can make it happen

Na na na, no no
(Baby, I, I can make it happen)
