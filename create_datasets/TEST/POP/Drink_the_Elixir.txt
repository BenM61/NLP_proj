The ground is getting frosty
Then small drops of mint on my scarf
My lifespan is an unknown
I've never strayed far from the path

I'll wrap myself in bandages
And leopard skin and bandages
And nobody will bother me
I'll wrap myself in bandages
Till it gets ridiculous
And nobody will bother me

Drink the Elixir

With Saturn on the stopwatch
There's hope for me yet on this Earth
But Venus had an off day
A century's gone by since my birth
I'll wrap myself in bandages
