Roll, cheah, cheah

Just them ghetto fabulous girls, gotta keep 'em in my world
Mama makin gangsta moves, rollin with this gangsta dudes
Sittin' on, spinnin' 24's, openin' up Bentley doors
Drunk at the party, hands up in the air but still she sexy when she shake her body
That type of chick that says hey girl, let's go to the after party
After that we go to my room for the after, after party

(Verse 3 - Mannie Fresh)
Once upon a time in this place called hood
Where the gangsta girls shake it and they all smell good
Lived this legendary pimp (pimp) by the name of Fresh
Fix hair, fix nails, fix toes, fix breast
But one chick super sick, make every nigga grab his stick
Heart pound up and down, when she goin' round and round
Do the Snake, stop and shake, bottom like an earthquake
I can't wait to meet her uh, undress her, f*ck her up
Now we leavin' from the club, and she let me cop a rub
Can't believe she choose me, 
Feelin On Her Booty
I'm about to cut like knives, strokin' mami with some ice,
Takin' me to paradise, I nut once, she nut twice
Sex in cities, rubbin' titties, that's how I get it
One more 'gain, with her friend, playa that's how I hit it
Now we grippin', grabbin', pullin', stabbin' (what is your name?)
It's Hypnotiq how I got it, but I'ma glad that you came
You can catch me in the club with a gangsta girl
When I ride, I'm gonna ride with a gangsta girl
When I smoke, I'm gonna smoke with a gangsta girl
When I freak, I'm gonna freak me a gangsta
