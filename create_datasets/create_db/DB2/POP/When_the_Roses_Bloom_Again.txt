Well, they're strollin' in the gloamin',
When the roses are in bloom.
A soldier and his sweetheart, brave and true.
And their hearts are filled with sorrow,
For their thoughts are of tomorrow,
As she pins a rose upon his coat of blue.

"Do not ask me, love, to linger,
"When you know not what to say.
"For duty calls your sweetheart's name again.
"And your heart need not be sighing,
"That I'll be among the dying.
"I'll be with you when the roses bloom again."

When the roses bloom again,
And the sun is on the river:
The Mockingbird will sing it's sweet refrain.
And in the days of Auld Lang Syne,
I'll be with you, sweetheart mine.
Oh, I'll be with you when the roses bloom again.

With the rattle of the battle,
Came a whisper soft and low:
"Our soldier, he is fallen in the fray."
"I am dying, I am dying,
"And I know I've got to go,
"But I wanna tell you before I pass away."

"There's a far and distant river,
"Where the roses are in bloom,
"And a sweetheart who is waiting there for me.
"And it's there, I pray you'll take me.
"I'll be faithful, don't forsake me.
"I'll be with you when the roses bloom again."

When the roses bloom again,
And the sun is on the river:
The Mockingbird will sing it's sweet refrain.
And in the days of Auld Lang Syne,
I'll be with you, sweetheart mine.
Oh, I'll be with you when the roses bloom again.
