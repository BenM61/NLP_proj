I fell in love in a 7/11 parking lot
Sat on the curb drinking Slurpee's we mixed with alcohol
We talked about all our dreams and how we would show 'em all (Whoa oh oh oh)

I told him I got a plan and I'm gonna dominate
And I don't need any man to be getting in my way
But if you talk with your hands then we can negotiate (Whoa oh oh oh)

I'll just keep moving my body (yeah)
I'm always ready to party (yeah)
No I don't listen to mommy (yeah)
And I'll never say that I'm sorry

Oh I'm an American girl
Hot blooded and I'm ready to go
I'm loving taking over the world
Hot blooded, all American girl (Whoa)
I was raised by a television
Every day is a competition
Put the key in my ignition (Oh-way-oh)

I wanna see all the stars and everything in between
I wanna buy a new heart out of a vending machine
'Cause It's a free country so baby we can do anything (Whoa)
I'll just keep moving my body (Yeah)
I'm always ready to party (Yeah)
No I don't listen to mommy (Yeah)
And I'll never say that I'm sorry

Oh I'm an American girl
Hot blooded and I'm ready to go
I'm loving taking over the world
Hot blooded, all American girl (Whoa)
I was raised by a television
Every day is a competition
Put the key in my ignition (Oh-way-oh)

You know we're gonna shine so bright (Oh we're gonna shine so bright)
Oh baby gonna go all night (Oh we're gonna go all night)
You know we're gonna shine so bright (Oh we're gonna shine so bright)
Oh baby gonna go all night

Oh I'm an American girl
Hot blooded and I'm ready to go
I'm loving taking over the world
Hot blooded, all American girl, I'm an American girl
I was raised by a television
Every day is a competition
Put the key in my ignition (Oh-way-oh)

I'm an American girl
Hot blooded and I'm ready to go
I'm loving taking over the world (I'm taking over)
I'm an American girl
