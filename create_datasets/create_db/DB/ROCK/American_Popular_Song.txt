It's a popular song
An American popular song
And there's something about it
Can't live without it

It's the tune of the day
Somehow it takes you away
And it grabs you
And it holds you
Feel it control you

Makes you want to clap your hands
Makes you want to stomp your feet
Makes you want to sing along
It means business
The American popular song
Goes on and on
The American popular song
Goes on and on
And on

It's a popular song
An American popular song
A simple story
Wrapped up in glory

Once you hear it you know
You got to hear it some more
And that's power, try it
You can't deny it

Makes you want to clap your hands
Makes you want to stomp your feet
Makes you want to sing along
It means business
The American popular song
Goes on and on
The American popular song
Goes on and on
And on
