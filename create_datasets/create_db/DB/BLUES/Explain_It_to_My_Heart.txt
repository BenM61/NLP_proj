No right to complain
Everything is just alright
Everyday's the same
Never get caught by surprise

I get up 'round nine
Have some coffee and a toast
And bus number five
Is taking me back home

Explain it to my heart, my intuition
Tells me something fell wide of the mark
My common sense tells me nothing's missing
I get another message from my heart

Longing for a UFO to get me
A little green man to take me away
I think I need a little science fiction to
Lighten up my day

I think I need a little science fiction to
Lighten up my day
Summers come and go
Christmas at my sisters house

It's strange how things flow
No interference without
Spending time with you
Every day and every night

And we'll watch the sky
To see when's the next flight
Explain it to my heart, my intuition
Tells me something fell wide of the mark

My common sense tells me nothing's missing
I get another message from my heart
Longing for a UFO to get me
A little green man to take me away

I think I need a little science fiction to
Lighten up my day
I think I need a little science fiction to
Lighten up my day

I'm tired of reality
Where things are so grey and predictable
Like to travel through the galaxy
To find me a lover from Mars

Explain it to my heart
