You can tie my hands behind my back
And lick your initials in my neck
Foreplay does nothing for me
But commitment makes me wet

I already know you're having an affair with words
But boo, I'm married to it
My vocabulary leaves most men wary
I need to know, can you get into it?

This is so torturous
(I know that I shouldn't)
But I can not resist
Just what is it that you are weaving
That's keeping my body from leaving?

Your presence is lingering
Longer than I thought it would and I
Feel that I should succumb to your magic
'Cause I know you're just as

Strong as an earthquake
Bright as a shinin' star
I remember the fragrance
I just couldn't believe I'd come so far for

Love in the fast lane
As my sanity quickly passed me by
Yeah, I left it all behind

Battling, battling, these feelings are traveling
Quicker than a flick of lightning, you were tightening
Round my heart and won't slow down
Burning hotter than the world underground

I'm feeling like Cupid's fool, what to do?
And the arrow's headed straight for you, you
I don't wanna love another, gotta keep this undercover
Brother I'm about to explode, I am

Strong as an earthquake
Bright as a shinin' star
I remember the fragrance
I just couldn't believe I'd come so far for

Love in the fast lane
As my sanity quickly passed me by
Yeah, I left it all behind

Would you let me lick you with alliteration
And tie you up with similes?
Give you pain and pleasure with soliloquies
Until you beg me for release

I think we could have the ebonic plague solution
Lace me with your lexiconic seed and in nine months
We could start to raise the revolution

Strong as an earthquake
Bright as a shinin' star
I remember the fragrance
I just couldn't believe I'd come so far for

Love in the fast lane
As my sanity quickly passed me by
Yeah, I left it all behind

Strong as an earthquake
Bright as a shinin' star
I remember the fragrance
I just couldn't believe I'd come so far for

Love in the fast lane
As my sanity quickly passed me by
Yeah, I left it all behind

Strong as an earthquake
Strong as an earthquake
Come so far for love in the fast lane
Bright as a shinin' star
