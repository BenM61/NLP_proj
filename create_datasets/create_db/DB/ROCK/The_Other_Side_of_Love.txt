The girl
Alone in her head
The tears
After what he said
The fear
Alone in the dark
The pain
She carries in her heart

When all you've ever wanted is the freedom that you lack
If you find a way to get up
Keep on running and don't look back

The other side of love
The other side of love
The other side of love
The other side of love

The boy
So much to give
The lies
He's forced to live
The son
The father and his ghost
The faith
Hurts him the most

When all you ever wanted it is the freedom that you lack
If you find a way to get up
Keep on running and don't look back

The other side of love
The other side of love
The other side of love
The other side of love

Somewhere
Hiding in the shadows
There's something
Everybody knows

When all you ever wanted it is the freedom that you lack
If you find a way to get up
Keep on running and don't look back

The other side of love
The other side of love
The other side of love
The other side of love

We are angels
We are demons
We are children all the same
We are angels
We are demons
We are children all the same

We are angels
We are demons
We are children all the same
We are angels
We are demons
We are children all the same
