All:            End of the spring and here she comes back
Hi Hi Hi Hi there
Them summer days, those summer days

That's when I had most of my fun, back
High high high high there
Them summer days, those summer days

Rose:           I "cloud nine" when I want to

Freddie:        Out of school, yeah

Larry:          County fair in the country sun

Sly:            And everything, it's true, ooh yeah

All:            Hot fun in the summertime x 4

All:            First of the fall and then she goes back
Bye bye bye bye there
Them summer days, those summer days

Rose:           "Boop-boop-ba-boop-boop" when I want to

Freddie:        Out of school, yeah

Larry:          County fair in the country sun

Sly:            And everything, it's true, ooh yeah

All:            Hot fun in the summertime x 4
