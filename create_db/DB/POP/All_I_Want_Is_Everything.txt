I feel delirious, come let's get out of here
We're so anonymous but it's all coming clear
We're heading for the sky
And we'll get lost in it 'cause
All I want, all I want, all I want
Is everything

And I will pose if I wanna
And I will vogue like Madonna
I might not dance like M.J, R.I.P.
But I will give the best of me

All I want is everything
Yes everything too much is not enough
I'm sick of settling for in between
And I'm not givin' up
As long as it feels right
At least we know that we're alive
All I want is everything, yes everything, yeah
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh

We don't ever stop
Let's watch the sun come up
We'll sleep when we're dead 'cause
Halfway kinda sucks
We're heading for the sky
And we'll get lost in it 'cause
All I want, all I want, all I want is everything

And I will pose if I wanna
And I will vogue like Madonna
I might not dance like M.J, R.I.P.
But I will give the best of me

All I want is everything
Yes everything too much is not enough
I'm sick of settling for in between
And I'm not givin' up
As long as it feels right
At least we know that we're alive
All I want is everything, yes everything, yeah
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh

Hold on to me
And I'll hold on to you (oh, oh)
Don't over think
What have we got to lose
It's me and you,
Me and you no matter what
Whoa oh ah oh whoa oh oh whoa

We're heading for the sky
And we'll get lost in it 'cause
All I want, all I want, all I want is everything

And I will pose if I wanna
And I will vogue like Madonna
I might not dance like M.J, R.I.P.
But I will give the best of me

All I want is everything
Yes everything too much is not enough
I'm sick of settling for in between
And I'm not givin' up
As long as it feels right
At least we know that we're alive
All I want is everything, yes everything, yeah
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
