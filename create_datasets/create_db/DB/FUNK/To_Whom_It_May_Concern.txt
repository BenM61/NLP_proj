Don't sit and wait
Don't sit and dream
Put on a smile
Go find a scene
I'm sure you'd meet
Someone who would really love you

Don't sit and hope
Don't sit and pine
If you've been hurt
Make up your mind
I'm sure you'd find
Someone who would really love you

I don't know why you sit around
I only know if love is gone
Don't sit alone with your pride

To whom this may concern to say
Don't wait for love to come your way
Don't waste your time
Make up your mind
And make it happen

I don't know why you sit around
I only know if love is gone
Don't sit alone with your pride
Listen to me and you would see
Just how fine your romance could be

I don't know why you sit around
I only know if love is gone
Don't sit alone with your pride
Listen to me and you would see
Just how fine your romance could be
