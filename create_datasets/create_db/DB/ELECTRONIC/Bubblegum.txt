I wish I had a boy that talks so sweet
I wish I had a boy to let my parents meet
I wish I had a cotton candy beat
I wish I had a room with an ensuite

I wish
I had
I wish
I had some
Bubblegum

(I wish I had some bubblegum, bubblegum, bubblegum, bubblegum)
Say it again now (bubblegum)
(I wish I had some bubblegum, bubblegum, bubblegum, bubblegum)
Alright

I wish I had someone to string along
I wish I had someone to rub my body on
I wish I had somewhere to dance all night long
I wish I had someone to rub my body on

I wish
I had
I wish
I had some
Bubblegum

(I wish I had some bubblegum, bubblegum, bubblegum, bubblegum)
Say it again now (bubblegum)
(I wish I had some bubblegum, bubblegum, bubblegum, bubblegum)
Everybody now

Now wrap it 'round your finger and stick it to the seat
All the boys are freaking on my cotton candy beat

(I wish I had some bubblegum, bubblegum, bubblegum, bubblegum)
Say it again now (bubblegum)
(I wish I had some bubblegum, bubblegum, bubblegum, bubblegum)
Alright

(I wish I had some bubblegum, bubblegum, bubblegum, bubblegum)
Say it again now (bubblegum)
(I wish I had some bubblegum)
