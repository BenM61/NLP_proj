There ain't no point holding back the tide, 
Still gonna get ya
Cause every little bird's gotta learn to fly 
Sooner or later
I don't want to lose you, 
Can't always do what you want to do
There ain't no point holding back the tide, 
Don't waste your time

Cause everything is out there
And there's no limits out there
We could be reaching out for anything if we try enough

Let the daylight in on a better day
It's been too long we've been 
Living under a raincloud

Daylight in on a better day
It's been too long we've been 
Living under a raincloud

There ain't no point holding back desire, 
Still gonna get ya
Strangers on a train driving through the night, 
Soon overtakes ya
If someone feels the same as you, 
Might as well just do what you want to do
There ain't no point holding back desire, 
Don't waste your time

Cause everything is out there
And there's no limits out there
We could be reaching out for anything if we try enough

Let the daylight in on a better day
It's been too long we've been 
Living under a raincloud

Daylight in on a better day
It's been too long we've been 
Living under a raincloud

Cause everything is out there
And there's no limits out there
We could be reaching out for anything if we try enough

Let the daylight in on a better day
It's been too long we've been 
Living under a raincloud

Daylight in on a better day
It's been too long we've been 
Living under a raincloud

Let the daylight in on a better day
It's been too long we've been 
Living under a raincloud

Daylight in on a better day
It's been too long we've been 
Living under a raincloud
