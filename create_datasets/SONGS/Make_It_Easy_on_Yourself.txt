'Cause breaking up is so
Very hard to do

If you really love her
And there's nothing I can do
Don't try to spare my feelings
Just tell me that we're through

And make it easy on yourself
Make it easy on yourself
'Cause breaking up is so very hard to do

And if the way I hold you
Can't compare to her caress
No words of consolation
Will make me miss you less

And my darling, if this is goodbye
I just know I'm gonna cry
So run to her
Before you start crying too

And make it easy on yourself
Make it easy on yourself
'Cause breaking up is so very hard to do

And make it easy on yourself
Make it easy on yourself
'Cause breaking up is so very hard to do

And make it easy on yourself
