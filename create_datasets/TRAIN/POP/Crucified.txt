Every time I wear this shirt I think of you.
All the dreams I have are always dreamt in blue
Every place I find myself I've been there with you
Abandoned loneliness I ask why, why, why?

Why did you crucify me?
Strung up for your love
Was I so blind to see?
Pushed aside, sterilized, crucified.

Looking back I see my faults, was I so wring
To lock you up inside my arms? I thought I was being strong.
Now I see you built the walls that keep me in
You turned my world around, and still I cry, cry, cry.

Why did you crucify me?
Strung up for your love
Was I so blind to see?
Pushed aside, sterilized, crucified.

Brutalized, immortalized, crucified.
Abandoned loneliness
You turned my world around, 
Words were never said...
