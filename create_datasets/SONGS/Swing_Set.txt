So hot! 
So
Hot! 

This is the sound of the 30's! 

1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4. 

Gather round all you ruggytutters, 
cause we're going to show you what Swing is all about! 
Oh yeah? 
Yeah! 
Yeah? 
Yeah! 

These great sounds should not be left to gather dust. 
You might dig out that old 78. 

Doodeedoot n' doodeetdoot n' doodeedoot n' ah ha ha ha! 

Hi Ex-Swinger, don't be a wimpy, go way out! 

Do you wanna dance?! 
Yeah! 

Swing. 

All hands on deck! 

Love that! Yeah! oh! 

OK everybody on the swings. 

Ah oh! 

The sound of the Swing era
kind of scratchy after all these years. 
If only it sounded like this

(Bebopin' & Scattin') 
What you probably remember was more like this
Oh oh oh oh
So 
Hot! 

And will fill me up! 

oh yeah! Swing time in the ol' corral.
