For a second ill be the fashion police 
And I'm just looking at your garms you been on too many catalog sprees
With your granny fied curtain designs, your hurting my eyes,
You really should revise your dress sense before you walk on by,
I'm kinda mixed up in this disco inferno,
Baggy jeans and a tight top, lemonade and Pernod
I'm sticking out like a sore thumb but I ain't concerned though, no, uh oh,oh oh oh (boogie)

Fling on an A D I D A S hoodie and just boogie woogie with me 
Oh
Or you can just. put on your dancing shoes and get loose
Can you get loose can you??

So I was up in this trendy bar mingling
My keys around my neck were jingling
And you was looking at me like it was my bling
You was staring at me like to say I was ginger
I was dishing out out the same dirty looks trust me your the minger

Who's she, who's that, who's her?
The bouncer was approaching me cause I was dressed really inappropriately
No hood, no hats, no this, no that
Lets roll uh ol' uh ol' (out)

Fling on an A D I D A S hoodie and just boogie woogie with me 
Oh
Or you can just. put on your dancing shoes and get loose
Can you get loose can you??

Right everybody, if you've got someone who cant dress properly, 
Yeah you need to direct them this way.

Why not just cut up all your old clothes 
And make a quilt so I can wrap myself up when im feeling cold,
Why not dash your ugly boots on the fire and burn them down to charcoal,
If your not feeling the way that your bedrin is dressing dont be stressing 
Send them in my direction please,
Black shoes , white socks, no oh
Polka dots, no oh
Flowery frocks, no oh
Just boogie woogie with me!
