How rich is your surface 
How much do you care
Does your blue heart turn away
How deep is that stare
Time hints that it's on your side
Don't think it's there
What's past could be a teaser line
Between mind and air

Was it a lie
Was it the truth
Does your blue heart turn away 
As you hit the roof

I never seem to get the drift 
When I hear some crowd talk 
It isn't only their chat-chat-chatter
Or the one line track of thought 
Isolation lies like dread
Outcast fears
In which they are so so locked
Reduced to tears

Was it a lie
Was it the truth 
Does blue heart turn away 
As you hit the roof 

Interviewed your dreams 
Walked on thin air
No time to wonder now 
As I break through their stare
Would they understand
If I were to show
That their answers burned to ground 
So I turned to go

So I turned to

Was it a lie 
Was it the truth
Does your blue heart turn away 
As you hit the roof
