There's something in the water
I can feel you getting under my skin
I am looking for another lover
I need someone who understands me

Two drinks down, there's something in the water, baby
Lose control, want someone to take me home
I lose touch, throw my arms around you, baby

I'm only human, baby
Sometimes act a little crazy (No, I'm not the only one)
I'm only human, baby
Need someone to come and save me
(Someone)
(Someone)
(To come and save me)
(Someone)

I just need someone who understands me
