It's hard for me to smile I feel like crying yet I always manage to grin
Friends won't know the pain that I feel or the misery that I'm in
Everyone thinks I'm happy for I smile and never frown
But looks are deceiving and nobody knows the hurt behind the face of a clown
I've got my pride my tears I'll hide whenever you are around
You never may know you hurt me so for I have a face of a clown
I'll try to conceal this pain that I feel I can't let it get me down
You won't have the pleasure of knowin' the hurt behind the face of a clown
(You won't have the pleasure of knowin') the hurt behind the face of a clown
