Baby, baby, won't you give me a chance
I know you're watching and I just can't dance
Well honey, honey, won't you give me a clue
I'm tired of hanging by the DJ box pretending that I'm cool
I catch your eyes and the whole world tumbles down
I said goodbye and you said I'll see you around
I kinda smile as if the whole thing's so passe
But deep inside
I close my eyes and pray

Oh baby, let me know
Should I stay or should I go
I've always stayed around you
Now I'm really nothing new
And if for
Some kind of miracle
Underneath the glitter ball
You'll see I'm not invisible
And anytime you want to go it's cool

Baby, baby, seen you give me the glance
You've got the ego but you just can't dance
Well honey, honey, better things I could do
Than hang around with all your slacker friends
Pretending that I'm cool

But late at night I feel the whole world tumble down
I said all right and you said I'll see you around
I bore my eyes as if I don't care anyway
But deep inside
I close my eyes and pray

Oh baby, let me know
Should I stay or should I go
I've always stayed around you
Now I'm really nothing new
And if for
Some kind of miracle
Underneath the glitter ball
You'll see I'm not invisible
And anytime you want to go it's cool

Oh baby, let me know
Why am I getting vertigo?
You've seen me tag around you
Now I'm really nothing new
But my reaction is chemical
Something kind of sexual
It's doing you incredible
So anytime you want to go it's cool

(Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba)

Why am I getting ready go?
You've seen me tag around you
Now I'm really nothing new
But my reaction is chemical
Something kind of sexual
It's doing you incredible
So anytime you want to go it's cool
