Zay T on the track
Gucci mane la flareso
Icy ent
We back man(We still icy man)
Stoopid jewelrystoopid gwap man
Guacamole on deck

See my chain stoopid
And my range stoopid
Girl I'm not stoopid
But my knots stoopid
All sets stoopid
V's stoopid
Girl it's Gucci Gucci
And my diamonds fruity

70 on my jacky baby
Colored karat bracelet baby
Patna spent bout 20 Gs
Gucci dropped 380 baby
Multi-color clarity
My necklaces are heavy mane
Hit the club then leave the club
Then come come back with another chain
Mighty mouse is icy dog
Bart Simpsons just stoopid
Yellow blue black green and white
The diamonds match the groupies
Digitally enhance the stones 
Pinky's like a movie
Truly I'm a walking lick
Gucci mane the talkin'g brick
If you ain't gonna talk no chickens
Dog who you talkin' two
7:thirty in the kitchen 
Nate-nate bout to go to school
Saturday I'm cookin chickens mama bout to go to work
Sunday Gucci cookin chickens
Granny bout to go to church

Heavy rist activity(Work)
Got me livin lovely
Cocaina-heavenly
Cocaina-shawty
Breakin' down ten chickens dog
Bout to cook the shake up
All these extra grams might as well go buy a Jacob
Gucci mane for mayor
Gucci mane so player
Reppin' east Atlanta that's ten minutes from Decatur
Almost match our cars
And our belts gon match our gators
You can't swag like Gucci
'Cause you don't got enough flavor
Heavy on the licorice
Industry ridiculous
Bitches I'm magnificent
I'm not very articulate

Gucci watz the penalty shawty wants the business
Every night is valentines
And every day is Christmas
And every day is Christmas

Gucci watz the penalty shawty wants the business
Every night is valentines
And every day is Christmas
And every day is Christmas

My girlfriend say she love me
But itz just the jewelry
Multi-color karatz got ya girlfriend kinda curious
First I drop my verse
And then I go and drop the chorus
Then I'm out the booth
Back to the trap you know I'm mournin'
Trapped before we started
Zaytoven record it
Zay you chargin' thirty like the Gucci can't afford it
Gucci charging forty dog that's a couple birdies
Gucci stoopid jewelry dog I don't think you heard it

Gucci watz the penalty shawty wants the business
Every night is valentines
And every day is Christmas
And every day is Christmas

Gucci watz the penalty shawty wants the business
Every night is valentines
And every day is Christmas
And every day is Christmas
