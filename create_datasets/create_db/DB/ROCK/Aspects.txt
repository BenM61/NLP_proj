It's not in the way
It's not in your hair
You won't find it
Under your chair

It's not in a hollow
Or pieces of wood
I don't see it
Anywhere no more

And as long as
The wind blows
The tides flow
Along

Under a blue sky
On a new wave
In a new world
Today

It's not in a holler
Not in a scream
You won't find it
Under your feet

It's always inside you
As old as the sun
It's holding the answers
As new as the young

And as long as
The wind blows
The tides flow
Along

Under a blue sky
On a new wave
In a new world
Today

Crippling aspects
Of life with no rhyme
Nor that of reason
Or that of time

To find true meanings
And patterns in things
Symbols in making
These moments exist

And as long as
The wind blows
The tides flow
Along

Under a blue sky
On a new wave
In a new world
Today
