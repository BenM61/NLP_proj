Maybe you are the sun
You really look like one
From what I've read you do
Maybe you are in everyone
Hiding away
What do you have to say?
Give me the voice
Give me the choice to do what I want to
I know you're there
Deep in the part of me that knows everything

Heaven's in me
Heaven's in me, I know

Maybe you are the moon
I know you're watching me
When I go to sleep
Give me the key
I'll try my best to weave a melody
Here in the dark
Give me a spark so I can find my way home

Heaven's in me
Heaven's in me, I know
