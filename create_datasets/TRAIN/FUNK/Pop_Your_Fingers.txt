Let's ride
It's a felling deep inside
It's like a burnin' fire
It's like a roller coaster rider
Makes you want to fly
A natural high
The beat, the beat
Come on, people, move your feet
Woo, pop your fingers
Shake your groove thing down to the ground
Well, I want to see you get down
Pop your fingers
Shake your booty down to the ground
Well, let me see you get down
I'm a natural dancer
I got a style of my own
And ladies, let me tell you
It's guaranteed to turn you on, lookey here
I can pop, I can rock, I can boogie
Dancin' is my specialty
I got my funky band in the background rockin' steady
So pick up wheels whenever you're ready
Pop your fingers
Shake your groove thing down to the ground
Well, I want to see you get down
Pop your fingers
Shake your booty down to the ground
Well
Feel the heat from the beat
You know you should be dancin'
Ladies, put your body in it
Fellas, now you say, "No, no, no, no, don't stop"
I want you to pop your fingers
Shake your groove thing down to the ground
Well, I want to see you get down
Pop your fingers
Shake your money maker down to the ground
Let me hear that horn sound
Ooh, pop your fingers
Shake your groove thing down to the ground
Well, I want to see you get down
Pop your fingers
Shake your money maker down to the ground
Well, I want to see you get down
All you roller-skaters
You should not be spectators
I want you to click your heels, spin your wheels
And get on down to this funky sound
I want you to pop your fingers
Shake your groove thing down to the ground
Well, I want to see you get down
Pop your fingers
Shake your booty down to the ground
Hey...yeah...hea...hea...
Everybody get on the floor
Get out your seat, get on your feet
Everybody get on the floor
Get out your seat, get on your feet
Ah...pop your fingers
Shake your groove thing down to the ground
Well, I want to see you get down
Pop your fingers
Shake your booty down to the ground
Ah...ah...ah...ah...
Pop your fingers
Shake your groove thing down to the ground
Ladies, check me out, check me out
Pop your fingers
Shake your money maker to the ground
Pop your fingers
