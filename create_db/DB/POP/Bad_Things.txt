I do bad things to good versions of me
I find good things in bad versions of me
I don’t know, it’s just versions of me, babe

I’m in a nightmare having a dream
I got a question, am I who I seem? Oh
I’m out the matrix from battlin’ me
I’m dipped in all black shadowing me

Something undefined is now taking over me
Who am I to fight me for my own soul?
I’m saying yes to things that usually are no for me
I kiss the neon night and let it have control

I do bad things to good versions of me
I find good things in bad versions of me
I don’t know, it’s just versions of me, babe

Why do I feel so free when I’m killin’ me?
I’m fallin’ to the sky caught between all the lines

I’m in a nightmare having a dream
I got a question, am I who I seem? Oh
I’m out the matrix from battlin’ me
I’m dipped in all black shadowing me

I get so sad at myself
When I love what’s bad for my health
I wanna do right and I would
But wrong taste and feels so good

Clutch the Dutch these feelin’s is hard to touch
Puff enough stuff, sometimes life is rough
On the cusp of doin’ right, who I’m foolin', right?
A child of the light goin’ wild for the night
'Cause most of fights I have, yo I have with myself
A good dude, but I can do bad by myself
It's sad that I felt that I could never be
With nobody, girl you know my G
O.d. On the good life, I’m a man, it’s simple
Probably the things I been through and the evil that men do
I want my cake and eat it, heartbreak they take and leave it
The same song I’m bein’ featured, I can’t delete it
The good you can see it but you really a bad girl
Livin’ in a mad world, sometimes you want that girl
You ain’t been Madonna through the drama
If it’s comin’ back it’s karma, a queen is made to honor

I do bad things to good versions of me
I find good things in bad versions of me
I don’t know, it’s just versions of me, babe

I get so sad at myself
When I love what’s bad for my health
I wanna do right and I would
But wrong taste and feels so good, it's so good

It’s just, it's just, it's just versions of me, baby
