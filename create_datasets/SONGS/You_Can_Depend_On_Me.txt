Though you say we're through,
I'll always love you 
And you can depend on me
Though someone that you've met 
Has made you forget, 
Honey, you know you can count on me 

When I wish, I wish you success 
And loads, loads of happiness
But baby, I gotta confess
I'll be lonely
If you ever, if you ever need a friend,
I'll be yours until the end
And you can depend on me

I wish you success
And loads of happiness
But, darling, I gotta confess
I'm gonna be lonely

Oh if you ever, if you ever need a friend,
I'll be right by your side 'til the end
And you can depend on me
You can depend on me
