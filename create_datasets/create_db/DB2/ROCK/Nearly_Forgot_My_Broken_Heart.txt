Every time I stare into the sun
Trying to find a reason to go on
All I ever get is burned and blind
Until the sky bleeds the pouring rain

When you came along the time was right
Pulled me like an apple red and ripe
Wasn't very long you took a bite
And did me wrong, and it serves me right

And I nearly forgot my broken heart
It's taking me miles away,
From the memory of how we broke apart
Here we go round again, again

Every little key unlocks the door
Every little secret has a lie
Tryna take a picture of the sun
And it won't help you to see the light

Every little word upon your lips
Makes a little cut where blood pours out
Every little drop of blood a kiss that I won't miss
Not for anything

And I nearly forgot my broken heart
It's taking me miles away,
From the memory of how we broke apart
Here we go round again
Every single feeling tells me this is leading to a heart
In broken little pieces and you know I need this
Like a hole in the head

Every single feeling tells me this is leading to a heart
In broken little pieces and you know I need this
Like a hole in the head

And I nearly forgot my broken heart
It's taking me miles away,
From the memory of how we broke apart
Here we go round again

And I nearly forgot my broken heart
It's taking me miles away,
From the memory of how we broke apart
Here we go round again

Here we go round again
Here we go round again
Here we go round again
