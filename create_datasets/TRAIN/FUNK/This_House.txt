This house is built
On a foundation of love
This house is built
On a foundation of love

Our toys are in the attic baby
Pictures on the wall
We can see our memories
From the days past in the mirror
Down the hall, oh yeah

Our love will survive in our own little paradise
So inspired, so inspired
Palatial it may not be
But it's a home and a castle to me
A dream from a magazine
And we'll never give it up 'cause

This house is built
On a foundation of love
This house is built
On a foundation of love

I'll try to comfort you baby
You try to comfort me yeah
I know you love me
With all your heart, oh yeah
'Cause you say you do

You know that when you are sad
I'll be there in a flash
At the drop of a hat, oh yeah
'Cause I want you to feel love
And you don't have to say a thing
You don't have to ask, 'cause baby

This house is built
On a foundation of love
This house is built
On a foundation of love

Maybe we'll strike it rich
One day really make it big
And I know because our love is so strong
We'll always have a home

This house is built
On a foundation of love
This house is built
On a foundation of love

This house is built
On a foundation of love
This house is built
On a foundation of love

This house is built
On a foundation of love
This house is built
On a foundation of love
