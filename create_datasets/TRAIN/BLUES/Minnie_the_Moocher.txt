Hey folks here's the story 'bout Minnie the Moocher
She was a low-down Hoochie Koocher

She was the roughest toughest frail
But Minnie had a heart as big as a whale

Hidey Hidey Hidey Hi
(Hidey Hidey Hidey Hi)
Hodey odey odey oh
(Hodey odey odey oh)
Heedey Heedey Heedey Hee
(Heedey Heedey Heedey Hee)
Hidey Hidey Hidey Ho
(Hidey Hidey Hidey Ho)

She messed around with a bloke named Smokey
She loved him though he was cokey

He took her down to Chinatown
And showed her how to kick the gong around

Hidey Hidey Hidey Hi
(Hidey Hidey Hidey Hi)
Whooooooooaaaap!
(Whooooooooaaaap!)
Heedey Heedey Heedey Hee
(Heedey Heedey Heedey Hee)
Hidey Hidey Hidey Ho
(Hidey Hidey Hidey Ho)

She had a dream about the King of Sweden
He gave her things that she was needin'
He gave her a home built of gold and steel
A diamond car with the platinum wheels

He gave her is townhouse and his racin' horses
Each meal she ate was a dozen courses
Had a million dollars worth of nickels and dimes
She sat around and counted them a million times

Poor Min'
Poor Min'
Poor Min'...
