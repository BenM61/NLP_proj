Be it animal or human
Crawling on the ground or on the roof
Hunting like the lonely, lonely fighter
Picking up the truth behind the messages

So fearful of the meanings
Turning to the Gods of technology
Wisdom far beyond the galaxies
But not enough to cure the last disease
Endangered species

Telecommunication
Counting every crater on the moon
Roaming like the only, only rider
High upon the back of flaming dragon rockets

Carrying the messages of the Gods of technology
Wisdom far beyond the galaxies
But not enough to save the Almighty

The butterfly, the tiger
Nothing but a shadow in the stone
Flamingo, future dinosaur
Underneath the urban sun

Victims of the truth behind the messages
Of the stoic saints of profit
Victims of the truth behind the messages
Of the stoic saints of profit

Smiling as the wonders of all nature
Crumbling in their pockets
Flying to another galaxy
Leaving Mother Earth
