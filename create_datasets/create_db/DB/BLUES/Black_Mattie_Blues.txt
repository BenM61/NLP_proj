Ooh, black Mattie
Where did you sleep last night?
Wit'ch yo hair all tangled
Clothes ain't fittin' you right
Wit'ch yo hair all tangled
Clothes ain't fittin' you right

Now, when I had money
'Hello, sugar pie'
Now done spent all my money
'Goodbye country girl'
Now done spent all my money
'Goodbye country girl'

Lord, my heart drips sorrow
Tears come a-rollin' down
Now you know by that, baby
Baby, to leave yo' town
Now, you know by that, baby
Think now leave yo' town

Now, life ain't worth livin'
If you ain't wit' the one you love
Lord, ain't worth livin'
If you ain't wit' the one you love
Now, life ain't worth livin'
If you ain't wit' the one you love

Now, you three times seven
You know what you wanna do
Now, the day that you quit me
I won't be mad with you
Now, the day that you quit me
I won't be mad with you.
