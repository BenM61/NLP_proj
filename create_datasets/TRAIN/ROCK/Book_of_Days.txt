the air here tastes like poison
the traffic moves on broken roads
the river runs like silver
my own feelings let me down
she's 14 and she's fading
there's a wasted year for 
every train that passes
she is leaving someday
someday never comes 
this road is poison
walk me to the wheels
i fear for my life
this road is poison
lovers coo goodbye
singing don't forget me boys
tired of waiting in the cheap seats
she is haunted by her failure here
the river runs like silver
my own feelings let me down
she's 24 and feels it
like a wasted year
for every day that passes
she is leaving one day
one day never comes
this road poison
walk me to the wheels
i fear for my life
this road is poison
lovers coo goodbye
singing don't forget me boys
in monday morning houses down
through gravel yards and dirty smoke
to somewhere on the sky line
what i feel is still the same
she's 40 and afraid that there's 
a wasted life for every town that passes
she is leaving here but
nothing here remains
this road is poison
walk me to the wires
i fear for my life
this road is poison
lovers coo goodbye
singing don't forget me boys
