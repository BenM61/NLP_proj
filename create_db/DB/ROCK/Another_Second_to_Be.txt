I hold a magazine in my hand
Facing the cover, it's me
They write about my coming end
No more than twelve months for me

Tainted and fainted and lonely 
I picture my life
Blameless and shameless 
I'm leaving in awful disgrace

Another second to be
Not another second to be

All the things I just have done
Passing my mind hundred times
All the tears I have cried, 
All the lies I have lied
All in hope for a better life

Tainted and fainted and lonely 
I picture my life
Blameless and shameless 
I'm leaving in awful disgrace

Another second to be
Not another second to be

Not another second to be
Lonely I picture my life 
No second to be
Time's running out and there's just 
No second to be
I'm leaving in awful disgrace 
No second to be
There's not another second to be
