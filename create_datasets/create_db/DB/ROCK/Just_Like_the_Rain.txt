Walking silent through the snow
Drifting softly to your door,
I'm coming home, I'm coming home.

I feel so strange, I feel so weak
I've walked a world of empty streets
In search alone, I've searched alone.

But you're still in my mind
You're still in my mind
And here's where the sound
Of my tears hits the ground
Just like the rain
Just like the rain.

When we walked along the shore
My darkness shaded, all we saw
I was unkind, I was unkind

I feel so strange, I feel so weak
I've walked a world of empty streets
In search alone, I've searched alone.

But you're still in my mind 
You're still in my mind
And here's where the sound 
Of my tears hits the ground
Just like the rain
Just like the rain.

But you're still in my mind
You're still in my mind
And here's where the sound 
Of my tears hits the ground
Just like the rain
Just like the rain
Just like the rain 
Just like the rain.
