Saw you again last night
I caught you catching my eye
I love to stare at you
I can see that I
See that I
Just wanna hold you
I just wanna know you
I just wanna spend the night wrapped up in you

But it's all
Yeah it's all
Just a Matter of time
And it's all
It's all just a matter of time

Don't care how long this takes
'Cause baby, I can't wait
I can't wait for you
To hold me
To know me

I just wanna spend the night wrapped up in you

But it's all
Yeah it's all
Just a Matter of time
And it's all
It's all just a matter of time

You're gonna wake up and find
It's just a matter of time
Until, until you are mine

'Cause it's all
Yeah it's all
Just a matter of time
Yeah it's all
yeah, it's all just a matter of time
Yeah, it's all
Yeah it's all just a matter of time

I saw you again last night
